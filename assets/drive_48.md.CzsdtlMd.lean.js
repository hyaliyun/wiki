After being attacked by a German soldier in Kursk, suffering from severe frostbite, and getting gangrenous wounds she became a quadruple amputee. With her injuries forcing her to retire from the military she spoke on the radio and wrote an open letter to the soldiers of the 1st Baltic Front which received over 3,000 replies. She was awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union on 6 December 1957 and the Florence Nightingale Medal in 1965, making her the third Soviet woman to receive the medal from the Red Cross. == Early life == Tusnolobova-Marchenko was born on 23 November 1920 to a Russian family of farmers on the Shevtsovo farm in Polotsk, located in present-day Belarus. After graduating from secondary school she worked as a chemist in Leninskugol; she joined the military after the start of the war and became a member of the Communist party in 1942. == World War II == Tusnolobova- Marchenko joined the Red Army in April 1942 after the start of the Second World War and after graduating from nursing courses was assigned to the 849th Rifle Regiment. During her first eight months of military service, she evacuated 123 wounded Soviet soldiers from the battlefield. On 2 February 1943 while trying to rescue a wounded platoon commander she was seriously injured, with both of her legs broken. As German soldiers ran across the battlefield she pretended to be dead, but one soldier noticed she was alive and began viciously beating her, nearly to death. A night reconnaissance platoon noticed she was still alive and managed to get her to a field hospital three days later. Having suffered from severe frostbite doctors had to perform eight surgeries to save her life, amputating her left hand, entire right arm, left foot and right leg up to the knee. During the remainder of the war while she was recovering she wrote an open letter to the 1st Baltic Front asking them to take revenge for the suffering inflicted in her and others. In her letter she opened by stating she had been stuck in a hospital bed for 15 months because of the Axis, referring to the Axis only as \\"the fascists\\", briefly mentioned her life before the war but went straight to describing her anger at the Axis for how she had to write with a pencil tied to the stub of her elbow, how her brother lost his hand and her husband died in the war, putting it bluntly as \\"The fascists did it\\" before ending the letter asking them not to spare a single German soldier to take revenge for the Russian people. The letter resulted in over 3,000 letters and replies from the troops, promising revenge in her name. Numerous Soviet tanks and aircraft bore the text of saying things like \\"This is for Zinaida\\" and \\"For Zinaida Tusnolobova\\" (Russian: За Зину Туснолобову!), a practice so popular that another Hero of the Soviet Union, Pyotr Andreev, had it written on his plane. == Postwar life == After the war she married a fellow veteran of the war, lieutenant Joseph Petrovich Marchenko who worked as an engineer after the war. One of her children, Vladimir Marchenko, served in the military for two years. In 1957, well after the end of the war, she was awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union by decree of the Supreme Soviet for her courage in the war and was awarded the Florence Nightingale Medal in 1965 by the International Red Cross. She passed away from pneumonia in 1980 at the age of 59. Schools and streets in Belarus were named in her honor and a commemorative envelope bearing her portrait was issued by Belarus in 1992. == Awards == 1992 Belarus envelope featuring Tusnolobova- Marchenko * Hero of the Soviet Union (6 December 1957) * Order of Lenin (6 December 1957) * Order of the Red Banner (14 April 1945) * Order of the Red Star (6 November 1942) * Florence Nightingale Medal (12 May 1965) * campaign and jubilee medals == See also == * List of female Heroes of the Soviet Union * Lyudmila Kravets * Vera Kashcheyeva == References == ===Bibliography=== * * Category:1920 births Category:1980 deaths Category:Heroes of the Soviet Union Category:Women in the Russian and Soviet military Category:Recipients of the Order of Lenin Category:Recipients of the Order of the Red Banner Category:Soviet amputees Category:Quadruple amputees Category:Florence Nightingale Medal recipients ","title":"Zinaida Tusnolobova-Marchenko"},{"id":"56624008","text":"Oglaf is a sexually explicit webcomic published online by Trudy Cooper and Doug Bayne.

These are characteristic of much of the mixed-use structures in the district, built between 1902 and 1914. The water tower near the main railway station, one of the delineators of the informal boundaries of the Imperial Quarter. It used to provide water for steam-powered locomotives. The Imperial Quarter of Metz is a district of the city of Metz, in the région of Grand-Est, in eastern France, initially built between 1902 and 1914 by the government of the ruling German Wilhelmine Empire, during the period of annexation of Alsace-Lorraine. Originally named \\"Neue Stadt\\" (literally \\"new city\\"), it is today divided between the administrative district of New Ville and Metz-Centre. It is principally represented by the \\"Imperial Triangle,\\" delineated by the area in between the water tower of the main railway station, St. Therese's Church, and the Serpenoise Gate. But the district extends beyond this core to include other edifices of the same period, such as the Governor's Palace, situated on the Place Giraud, behind the Serpenoise Gate. Aside from the more important Neustadt district of Strasbourg, the Imperial Quarter of Metz contains the most complete and best-preserved examples of urbanism under the German Second Reich. In Germany itself, the comparable districts of such cities often suffered the bombardment by Allied forces in the Second World War. The Imperial Quarter is remarkable for the multiplicity of architectural styles represented, despite the voluntary Germanization assumed by the city. ==History== ', vintage postcard dated 31 July 1917, showing the headquarters of the German Army garrison constructed in the Imperial Quarter between 1902 and 1914. Up until the beginning of the twentieth century, the district was generally referred to as the Neue Stadt (\\"New City\\"), an area where the German authorities had decided to build a new extension south of the historic center of Metz. The enlargement of the city used the land ceded by the military garrison thanks to the removal of the old medieval city walls by order of Kaiser Wilhelm II in 1898, but most of the development only gathered steam starting in 1902. The moniker \\"New City\\" was reborn in the name of the administrative district \\"Nouvelle Ville.\\"http://fr.structurae.de/projects/data/index.cfm?id=p0000386 This urbanization project proceeded under the guise of the modernization of the city of Metz, but equally under a marked desire of Wilhelm's government to Germanize the city. Metz essentially had existed as a city characterized by a French building tradition since the Middle Ages, and despite its inclusion within the boundaries of the Holy Roman Empire, the use of High Gothic architecture was evident in monuments such as the cathedral, which was less Germanic in character than the Cathedral of Strasbourg. Wilhelm II hoped to give the Metz a much more Germanic identity, breaking with the policies instituted under the reign of his grandfather Wilhelm I, wherein stylistic continuity in architecture had generally been respected. The urban guidelines of 1903 instituted a different status to the north side of the \\"ring\\" of open land that was opened up with the demolition of the old ramparts. It stipulated that this area should consist of houses encircles by gardens, having a maximum height of three floors, in order to soften the transition between the older buildings of the city center and the new, taller apartment houses that would populate the areas to the south. The villas on what is today known as the Avenue Foch in Metz exude this kind of neat and tidy character, reflecting the traditions of the period, and use a diverse, usually historicist, set of styles.Brochure of the Constellation program, \\" En attendant l’ouverture du Centre Pompidou-Metz \\", in particular the section Villas de l’avenue Foch, p. 91. ==Urbanism and General Morphology== The Avenue Foch with its garden on the median strip. The Imperial Quarter of Metz is distinguished by broader streets in a ring of urban development loosely defined by its main artery, the Avenue Foch. It is bordered to the north by the old city and to the south by the train lines and yards that form a man-made barrier. In keeping with the general tenets of Haussmannian nineteenth-century urban development, the Imperial Quarter is split up with regularity by large spaces such as public squares and isolated edifices that are distinguished from their neighbors by their style or their verdant surroundings. Thus, despite the dominating presence of rows of apartment buildings, certain parts of the district, such as the Vacquinière, to the southwest, neighboring the city of Montigny-lès- Metz, are composed entirely of mansions. The army installations, which predate the urban development of this area, are equally concentrated to the northwest. The general organization of the space hinges on two main plazas, the Place Raymond-Mondon (formerly the Place Impériale), and the Place du Général-de- Gaulle, which forms the large forecourt to the main railway station, accessed from the rue Gambetta. When it was known as the Place Impériale, the Place Raymond-Mondon symbolized otherwise the associated powers of the Kaiser (an equestrian statue of whom, located there, was overturned in 1918 by the French). These included financial power, symbolized by the Imperial Bank; the corporate powers of the Chamber of Commerce; military power through the view of the Prince-Frederick-Charles army barracks; and the religious power with a church, whose construction was canceled due to the First World War. This plaza also constituted the junction between the new city and the old districts, as indicated by the preservation of the medieval Tour Camoufle, part of the old city walls. ===Architecture=== A Gothic-revival building on the rue Mozart in the Imperial Quarter, illustrative of the diversity of historicist architecture in the district. The district is home to a remarkable diversity of architecture. It served, in effect, as a stylistic laboratory for the German architects in the city during the Second Reich. Historicist styles characterize the majority of the buildings, but respond often to the desire of the Imperial state to Germanize the city, which meant that many buildings use architectural styles that recall the German Middle Ages. In turn, the parts of the district constructed during the interwar period (1919–1939) retain the trend of continuing modernization of the city, but in a way that recalls its French heritage.Christiane Pignon-Feller, Metz 1900–1939 (Paris: Patrimoine, 2015). The period of urbanization during the 1900s and 1910s often revives architectural terms such as Rhenish-Romanesque-revival for Metz's railway station and the main post office, or Flemish-Renaissance-revival for the Governor's Palace. Everywhere one notes a multiplicity of styles in the architecture of private buildings of the era, a development easily visible in the eclectic composition of structures on the Avenue Foch, mixing a kind of Neoclassical rigor with elements of Art Nouveau or traditional Alsacian residences. On the other hand, certain francophile architects maintained their symbolic opposition to the newly entrenched German regime through their preference for neoclassical, Haussmannian apartment buildings. Still others were inspired by currents such as the Vienna Secession, manifest in the so- called Crystal Palace, whose façade was only rediscovered in the 1960s. The architectural decoration is equally distinctive for its variety of colors, dominated by the grey and pink of buildings constructed of sandstone and the yellow of those constructed out of the pierre de Jaumont, a type of local limestone. The interwar period, when Metz reverted to French rule, was marked by a \\"revanchist\\" architecture, wherein one finds the large-scale use of Haussmannian Neoclassicism and a Baroque revival. These styles harmonize well with the heavy Neoclassicism characteristic of French architecture during the Belle Époque of roughly 1890–1914. These remain, however, less ostentatious overall than the German constructions throughout the rest of the district, out of respect in planning strategies for historic structures, as codified in an ordinance of the city of Metz between 1911 and 1939. In the 1930s, modern architecture also brought the implantation of Art Deco, already in full bloom elsewhere around the world.Bevis Hillier, Art Deco of the 20s and 30s (London, 1968). ==Recognition== The main railway terminal in Metz serves as the focal point of the Place du Général de Gaulle in the Imperial Quarter. Even though it is depicted in postcards of Metz from the early twentieth century, the Imperial Quarter was not well-appreciated by Messins of the interwar period. They instead favored the nationalism of the Lorraine native Maurice Barrès, who castigated the architecture of Metz's railway station (which had been designed by the Berlin architect Jürgen Kröger and built between 1905 and 1908): \\"One welcomes the dignified ambition of a cathedral, but this is only tortuous, an immense paté of meat.\\"Maurice Barrès, Colette Baudoche (Paris, 1909), p. 6. However, starting in the 1980s the Imperial Quarter gained new favor with both local officials and residents. Several campaigns for the renovation and refurbishment of the architectural patrimony of the district began, such as the cleaning of building façades, most notably those of the train station, which had blackened over the years.By the 1960s, the train station had become significantly grimy, as photographs attest. By 2014, the remaining restorations to take place encompassed a much smaller scale, such as those to the façade of the former Hôtel du Globe, on the Place du Général de Gaulle, facing the train station. The district was nominated by the city for inscription by UNESCO onto its list of World Heritage Sites in June 2007 due to several features of original urban planning and architectural character: * The variety of architectural styles, from Romanesque revival to Jugendstil (Art Nouveau), by way of the Baroque * The variety of colored stone used in construction, such as the pierre de Jaumont, a yellow stone; pink sandstone; or white stone. When its candidacy was rejected, a new dossier was prepared in 2009 by the office of the mayor of Metz. This new application dubbed the district \\"Metz Royal and Imperial,\\" thereby putting the emphasis on the double urban identity of the city, playing on the opposition and complementary nature between the \\"royal\\" old city around the cathedral (developed under the French monarchy of the ancien régime before 1789), and the Imperial Quarter developed under the Wilhelmine Empire. It thus showed the transformation of urban space from an older, clustered, topographically-oriented and organically-developed medieval city to the newer, rationally-planned, transportation-oriented and distinctly zoned sectors of the enlarged urban area. One month and a half after its submission to the French Committee for Worldwide Patrimony, the body approved its inscription to the list of French World Heritage Sites of UNESCO, later ratified by the Ministry of Culture and Communication.Article du Républicain Lorrain In April 2014, the internet site for UNESCO added the candidacy of Metz to its page for France.La fiche de la ville de Metz sur le site de l'Unesco ==Landmarks and Important Buildings== ', old postcard mailed on 11 February 1917, showing the broad, tree-lined \\"ring\\" avenues along the path of the old city walls.

Its southern side is dominated by the rail yards approaching the main railway station. Nearby here are situated: * The Grand (Catholic) Seminary of Metz, dominated by its Chapel of St-Charles-Borromeo (1907) * The railway station water tower (1908) The avenue Foch, notable for its green space and central walking path, features several private mansions at its west entrance:Brochure du programme Constellation, « En attendant l’ouverture du Centre Pompidou-Metz », 136 p., Gare et Esplanade, p. 90. * Villa Bleyler (no. 14), Baroque-revival, punctuated by Art Nouveau, designed by Ludwig Becker, 1904–1906 * Villa Wildenberger (no. 16), Art Nouveau decoration, designed by Karl Griebel, 1903 * Villa Wahn (no. 18), Renaissance-revival, designed by Conrad Wahn, 1903 * Villa Linden (no. 20), Renaissance-revival, designed by Scheden, 1905 * Villa Burger, also known as Villa Salomon (no. 22) rural vernacular with wood paneling, designed by Eduard-Hermann Heppe, 1904 * Villa Lentz (no. 24), Neoclassical, designed by Jules-Geoffroy Berninger et Gustave Kraft, 1904 The avenue also includes some other impressive buildings: * The Hôtel Royal, Rhenish-Renaissance-revival, 1905 * The Hôtel des Mines, also called the Hôtel Terminus, Renaissance-revival, 1906 * The General Treasury of Moselle, formerly the Bank of Luxembourg, Neoclassical The Place Raymond- Mondon, built when the Imperial Quarter was laid out in 1902, was formerly the Place Impériale.

Around it, one will find: * The Hôtel Foch, Baroque Revival, 1907 * The Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Moselle, no. 10-12 Avenue Foch, also constructed in pink sandstone as the Imperial Bank, a symbol of financial power, designed by Robert Curjel and Karl Moser, 1907 * The Hôtel des Arts et Métiers, no. 1-3 Avenue Foch, Flemish Renaissance-revival structure also of pink sandstone, built as the Chamber of Commerce, a symbol of German corporatist power, designed by Gustave Oberthür and Ernst Priedat, 1909 * The Tour Camoufle, in its eponymous square on the Avenue Foch, one of the last vestiges of the medieval walls of the city The Avenue Joffre shows much more sobriety with one side including German buildings that are relatively austere, facing a set of French Haussmannian structures on the other side, leading up to the spot where Wilhelm II wanted to erect his church. The part of the avenue adjacent to the demolished walls—those dating from the Renaissance to the north and those built by Marshal Sébastien Vauban during the reign of Louis XIV to the south—is today an access ramp for the autoroute A31. Formerly a tree-lined avenue, this highway is marked at the north by the presence of the Square Gallieni and the gardens of the Governor's Palace. There, overlooking the Place Raymond-Mondon, are: * The Rhenish Bank, with minimalist/geometric decoration inspired by the Vienna Secession, 1907 * An heavy Neoclassical apartment block (\\"Revanchist Haussmanianism\\"), 1925 And along the highway: * The military barracks Barbot and de Lattre de Tassigny, located on the site of Vauban's bastion of the 17th century, built 1890–93 * The Serpenoise Gate, a triumphal arch whose current form dates from 1903; it was reconstructed (from an earlier version) in 1852 and enlarged in 1892 * The Monument to the Fallen by Paul Niclausse, Art Deco, from 1935 ===Monuments and Sites of Interest=== * Metz-Ville railway station (Gare de Metz), the water tower, and the passage to the Amphitheater, designed by Jürgen Kröger, 1905–08 * Main post office, designed by Kröger and Ludwig Bettcher, 1905–11 * Arcades of the rue Gambetta (along the Hôtel des Arts & Métiers) and the Crystal Palace (whose façade is hidden, however) * Old Metz railway station, 1878, on the place du Roi-George (formerly the place de la Gare); it replaced the initial train station, built in 1852 and destroyed by fire in 1872) * Art Deco building at the corner of the rues Henry-Maret and Pasteur * The Beer Hall, 1906, at no. 1 avenue Leclerc-de-Hautecloque, built in a regionalist German style, and no. 3, a Gothic-revival building dedicated to wine * The Kaiser Wilhelm House, on the rue Mozart, Baroque-revival, 1903 * The Salle Braun and the Foyer Mozart, formerly the Protestant publishing house, 1907 * The Hôpital Notre-Dame-de- Bon-Secours, 1914, before 1919 named the Hôpital Sainte-Marie * The former ceramics shop and studio of Villeroy & Boch, Art Nouveau * Villas along the boulevard Clemenceau ===Educational facilities=== The expansion of Metz during the period of German rule also prompted the construction of various other educational institutions across the city. The Germanization of the architecture of schools is evident in the old Ecole de la Place de la Grève de Metz (Sandplatzschule), today the Ecole de Saint-Eucaire; the Ecole communale des filles de la rue de Chèvre (Madchenschule in der Ziegenstrasse); at the Ecole de la rue Paixhans (Volksschule in der Paixhansstrasse); and even in the Ecole normale d'Instituteurs (Lehrerseminar), a teacher's college. Two such institutions specifically within the Imperial Quarter were built during this period: * The Ecole supérieure de jeunes filles (Höhere Mädchenschule), on the Place de Maud'huy, now the lycée (high school) Georges-de-la-Tour, built 1906–10 and enlarged in 1930 * The Ecole pratique supérieure de Metz (Oberrealschule), today the lycée Louis-Vincent, built 1913–16 with an expansion in 1933 More recently, the campus complex Georges-de-la- Tour—comprising both a collège (middle school), and the lycée (high school), has enlarged the site at the Place de Maud'huy, formerly that of the Barbot military barracks. ===Military Installations=== * The barracks of Prince Frederick Carl, 1890; later renamed de Lattre de Tassigny and Barbot, the latter now part of the George-de-la-Tour campus * The Governor's Palace, 1902–05 * The General Staff's residence, the former Palais de l'Intendance, on the Boulevard Clemenceau, Baroque-revival ===Religious Buildings=== * Chapel of St. Charles Borromeo, at the Main Seminary, 1907–08 * Church of St. Therese of the Infant Jesus, 1954 ===Plazas, Gardens, and Green Spaces=== * Place Raymond-Mondon * Place du Général-Mangin * Place du Général-de-Gaulle * Place du Roi-George * Allée verte de l'Avenue Foch * Jardin des Cinq Sens (in the Main Seminary) * Place Saint-Thiébault * Square Camoufle * Square Gallieni * Square Giraud and the gardens of the Governor's Palace * Place de Maud'huy * Square Jean-Pierre-Jean ==See also== * ** ** ** ==References== Category:Architecture of France Category:Metz ","title":"Imperial Quarter of Metz"},{"id":"56624056","text":"This is a Chinese name; the family name is Yang Yang Chihung (; ; born 25 October 1947) is a Taiwanese-American artist. == Early life and education== Yang Chihung was born on 25 October 1947, in Chungli, Taiwan. He developed an interest in art in early childhood, and found inspirations to pursue an artist career after reading Lust for Life – The Life of Vincent van Gogh, translated by poet Yu Kuang-chung, in junior high school. Between 1965 and 1968, he attended then National Taiwan College of Art, developing a sound foundation in oil painting under the tutelage of famous Taiwanese artists of the Japanese Colonial period, such as Liao Chi-chun, Li Mei-shu and Yang San-lang. Meanwhile, he actively attended events organized by the modern art groups of Taiwan, namely the Fifth Moon Group and Ton Fan Group, only to find himself both intimidated and dissatisfied with the then relatively conservative art environment in Taiwan. In 1979, he emigrated to the United States of America with his wife, Jane, and their son, Daniel. In 1984–85 and again in 1985–86, he was twice awarded a year's residency at The Clocktower Studio in New York City by MoMA P.S.1. == Career == In 2013, Yang, along with Xu Bing, Zhang Huan, and Li Chen, were the four artists featured in the Discovery Channel Asia documentary series, Chineseness, a multi-series production that focused on postwar Chinese contemporary artists. As part of the Chinese American: Exclusion/Inclusion series, Yang presented the U.S. premiere screening of the Chineseness episode at the New York Historical Society in 2014. Yang Chihung's oeuvre has been reviewed in journals by many noted critics of contemporary art, including Kenneth Baker [San Francisco Chronicle, 29 May 1985], Eleanor Heartney [Art News, November 1984], Gerrit Henry [Art in America, December 1989], Catherine Liu [Flash Art, Jan/Feb1988], Robert C. Morgan [Arts Magazine, January 1988], and John Yau [Artforum, November 1985]. Catalogues of his solo exhibitions have included essays by John Yau [1984 and 1986], Michael Walls [1987], Margaret Sheffield [1987], Frederick Ted Castle [1990], Barry Schwabsky [1993], and David Ebony [1995]. His works are included in significant museum, corporate, and private art collections in Western Europe, the Americas, and Asia. == Creative work == Yang Chihung's art has revolved around the explorations and reflections on existentialism and humanism. His adolescent anxiety and inner struggles were documented in his foremost series The Representation of The Self, where the Impressionist and Expressionist- styled self-portraits were inspired by influences from Christian figures, philosophy, literature and music. The works are, in a way, psychoanalysis of the artist himself, reflecting on the growing concerns of personal identity and existence. Following university graduation, Yang worked as a graphic designer at a construction company, learning about advertising, prints and photography, the last of which would later become a lifetime passion. His then series Era of Production delved into the tastelessness of the visual culture mass-produced and disseminated by and for the public, wherein his use of collage and everyday objects implicated a looming conformist attitude that propelled the loss of personal identity under the social construct. Yang emigrated to New York City in 1979 in search for better opportunities; fortunately, his arrival coincided with New York galleries regaining interest for painting in contrary to conceptual and minimalist art, thus Yang smoothly caught on the blossoming era of post-modernism. His series Exploration of Civilization and Archaeology presented pictorial clashes between different cultures that featured juxtapositions of dissimilar iconography, such as symbols of present and past, East and West, or nature and human. Compositions from this period also fashioned vivid contrast between colors and light, a painterly aspect that would later be equally recognized as the artist's signature. During his time at New York, Yang consistently wrote articles for the Taiwan-based Artist Magazine, the articles were subsequently compiled into a book and published in 1987 as New Trends in Modern Art. His next series Botanical Aesthetics was aroused by an incidental discovery of a bag of seeds. The seeds were originally brought from Taiwan to be planted in the U.S., but had been neglected by the artist for almost two years; nevertheless, Yang planted them anyway and was astounded when the plantations sprouted from earth. Thus, Botanical Aesthetics deems to celebrate the triumph of human life through the metaphor of botanic vitality, insinuating a basic survival instinct that is genetically encoded in all living organisms. Unlike the commonly seen still-life floral paintings, Yang's depicted botanic are often interpreted as organic forms that resiliently grow over time, a visual allegory contrasting to cultural legacies that have continued to expand and transform into new existences. The Organic Abstract Expression initialized Yang's creative transition toward abstract paintings. As a continuation on the idea of botanic vitality, the compositions have departed from representing such symbols to instead illustrate the idea of their inherent quality through gestural motions. Works from this series still retained Yang's symbolic color and light contrasts, and the contours of botanic or landscape may still be vaguely identified, but these faintly visible iconography are overshadowed by rugged lines and splashed color fields to echo with the artist's insight of the exterior world. In the current and ongoing series, The Eastern Poetics, Yang seeks to manifest his retrospection of personal cultural heritage while integrating the art of East and West by combining aspects of cursive script calligraphy and stream of consciousness literature. The resulting compositions are usually unadorned with a simplistic black and white undertone, free of definite structure, yet extensive and thought-provoking through their inspired imagery. By abandoning all visual cues of objects and symbols, Yang explores inspirations from within, resonating with an inner vision that transcends through the boundary of time and space. == Awards and recognition== * 1989, Outstanding Asian American Artist Award, by Governor of New York *1984–1986, MoMA P.S.1 National Studio Program, Residency at Clocktower Studio, New York == Selected exhibitions == === Solo === * 2019 Majestic Momentum – Yang Chihung, Guangdong Museum of Art, Guangzhou, China *2017–2018 The Sensibilities of Black and White – Yang Chihung's Recent Works from the Stream of Consciousness Series, Asia Arts Center Beijing, Beijing, ChinaThe Sensibilities of Black and White * 2015 Eternal Present – Recent Paintings by Yang Chihung, Ueno Royal Museum, Tokyo, JapanEternal Present * 2014 Faces of Contemporary Intelligentsia, New Taipei City Art Center, Tamsui Historical Museum, Taipei, Taiwan *2014 The Poetics of Polyphony: Yang Chihung Solo Exhibition, Asia Art Center, Taipei, Taiwan * 2011–2012 Beyond Painting – Chihung Yang's Genes of Creativity, Kaohsiung Museum of Fine Arts, Kaohsiung, Taiwan * 2010 Chihung Yang 40 Years of Painting, National Taiwan Museum of Fine Arts, Taichung, Taiwan * 2009 Chihung Yang: Sculpting In Time, Chung Shan National Gallery, National Dr. Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall, Taipei, Taiwan * 2008 Yang Chihung Recent Paintings, ChinaSquare Gallery, New York City * 2007 Inner Vision．Human Condition, National Art Museum of China, Beijing, China *2004 The Images of the Mind, National Museum of History, Taipei, Taiwan * 2003 Sejong Center Museum of Fine Art, Seoul, Korea *1987 Chihung Yang: Paintings and Works on Paper 1986–1987, Galería Nacional de Arte Contemporáneo, Museo de Arte Costarricense, San José, Costa Rica === Group === * 2016 1960 –The Origin of Taiwan's Modern Art, Asia Art Center, Taipei, Taiwan * 2013 Culture．Mind．Becoming, Venice Biennale, Venice, Italy * 2013 Formless Form: Taiwanese Abstract Art, Guangdong Museum of Art, Guangzhou, China * 2012 Formless Form: Taiwanese Abstract Art, Taipei Fine Arts Museum, Taipei, Taiwan * 2011 Taiwan 100 – Taiwan Contemporary Artists Group Exhibition\\", Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall/National Taiwan Museum of Fine Arts/Tainan Municipal Cultural Center, Taipei/Taichung/Tainan, Taiwan * 2010 Spirit of the East II – Bridging, Asia Art Center, Beijing, China * 2006 The 3rd Space – Chinese Text of Abstract Art, Jindu Art Center/Ningbo Museum of Art/ Shanghai Museum of Art, Beijing/Ningbo/Shanghai, China * 2002 An Exhibition of International Chinese Paintings, Guangdong Museum of Art, Guangzhou, China * 2001 Taipei Contemporary Art Exhibition, Shanghai Art Museum, Shanghai, China * 1999 Visions of Pluralism, China Art Museum, Beijing, China * 1997 A Thought Intercepted, California Museum of Art, Santa Rosa, USA * 1994 Taipei Modern Art Exhibition, The National Gallery, Bangkok, Thailand * 1991 Taipei-New York: Confrontation of Modernism, Taipei Fine Arts Museum, Taipei, Taiwan * 1990 The Matter at Hand: Contemporary Drawings, Art Museum, University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, Milwaukee, USA * 1985 National and International Studio Program, The Institute for Art and Urban Resources, Inc., Clocktower Gallery, New York City * 1982 Contemporary Chinese Art Exhibition, Musei Civici di Macerata, Macerata, Italy * 1978 Asian Contemporary Art Exhibition, Ueno Museum of Art, Tokyo, Japan * 1977 Asia Modern Art, Ueno Royal Museum, Tokyo, Japan == Art work == === Series === *The Representation of the Self (1967–1975) *Era of Reproduction (1976–1980) *Exploration of Civilization and Archaeology (1981–1988) *Botanical Aesthetics (1989–1997) *Organic Abstract Expression (1998–2010) *The Eastern Poetics (2011–present) *Ink Works === Publications === * Yang Chihung The Sensibilities of Black and White – the Stream of Consciousness Series, Asia Art Center, 2018, * Eternal Present: Recent Paintings by Yang Chihung, Asia Art Center, 2016, * Yang Chihung 1967–2014, Asia Art Center, 2014, * Chihung Yang: 40 Years of Painting, National Taiwan Museum of Fine Arts, 2010, * Inner Vision．Human Condition: Chihung Yang Solo Exhibition in National Art Museum of China, Asia Art Center, 2007, * The Images of the Mind: Chihung Yang’s Painting, National Museum of History, 2004, * New Trends in Modern Art, Artist Magazine, 1987 == References == == External links == *Official website Category:American people of Taiwanese descent Category:21st-century American painters Category:Living people Category:1947 births ","title":"Chihung Yang"},{"id":"56624066","text":"Dmitry Georgievich Dmitriev (; born 3 March 1956) is a Russian male former long-distance runner who competed for the Soviet Union.

Andrei Rabodzeenko ==Personal== Born in Kyrgyzstan, USSR, he completed his studies at the Mukhina School of Art and Design in Leningrad, USSR (now St. Petersburg Art and Industry Academy). Since 1991, he lives and works in Chicago, Illinois, USA. He is a member of Chicago Sculpture International. ==Artwork== Andrei Rabodzeenko's art focuses on philosophical themes, and has been characterized as capturing the spirit of the times. In his work, he asks \\"questions that humans have been asking for millennia—questions about ignorance and suffering, faith and pride, ambition and greed. And above all, about divine power. Lots of people steer clear of these deep waters. Yet the ways each generation explores them feed the zeitgeist, or spirit of the times.\\" Rabodzeenko explores such philosophical themes in different media and styles: painting, drawing, and sculpture. In oils, he paints in two distinct styles, Archetypes and Metaphysics. Archetypes are a realistic-surrealistic style using techniques and images reminiscent of art from the early Italian Renaissance. This work has been described by one critic as expressing humanistic values in allegorical form. Another reviewer points to the fact that although the work initially looks like it is straight from the Renaissance, after closer inspection, the work reveals subtle references to modernity. Metaphysics is a more primitive, symbolic style that mines personal yet universal dream imagery. \\"Imagine the glowing, contemporary paintings of Mark Rothko, throw in the symbolism of Salvador Dali, and mix it up with some Picasso etchings, and you start to grasp the world of ... artist Andrei Rabodzeenko.\\" He also creates semi-abstract sculptures out of wood and metal, installations, and graphic work, using ink, charcoal, and chalk on paper. His paintings, drawings, and sculptures are in private and public collections, including the Loyola University Museum of Art (Chicago), Skokie Northshore Sculpture Park (Skokie, IL), and Emmanuel College, Cambridge University (UK). == References == ==Further reading== *Kaminski, Simon. “With All Our Knowledge” (interview with artist Andrei Rabodzeenko), LiteraruS, 1 (38), Helsinki, January 2013, 54-60 *Elagina, Elena. \\"A Happy Artist,\\" Severnaya Avrora, St. Petersburg, Russia, September 2009, 167-183 * Lokot’kov, Nikolai. \\"Featured Artist: Andrei Rabodzeenko,\\" Vvedenskaya Storona, Staraya Russa, Russia, No. 2, June 2007, 30-31 ==External links== * Andrei Rabodzeenko’s website * Rabodzeenko at the Loyola University Museum of Art * Rabodzeenko at the Skokie Northshore Sculpture Park Category:1961 births Category:Living people Category:American male artists ","title":"Andrei Rabodzeenko"},{"id":"56624177","text":"Three ships of the Royal Navy have borne the name HMS Insolent: * , renamed Arrogante in 1795 and captured by on 19 April 1798, renamed HMS Insolent on 31 August 1798, and serving thereafter in the Royal Navy until sold on 11 June 1818.Colledge, p. 39. *, a wooden steam gunboat launched on 26 January 1856 and sold 1 May 1869.Colledge, p. 180. *, a 265-ton iron steam flatiron gunboat launched on 15 March 1881 and reduced to harbor service as a gate vessel in Portsmouth Harbour in January 1918; foundered on 1 July 1922. ==Citations== ==References== * Category:Royal Navy ship names ","title":"HMS Insolent"},{"id":"56624188","text":"Antje Schröder (born 2 September 1963) is a German female former track and field athlete who competed in the 800 metres.

These deportations, ordered by SS officer and head of the Gestapo Reinhard Heydrich, displaced thousands of Polish Jews along the Germany-Poland border. == Origins == From 1935-1938, Jews living within Germany had been stripped of most of their rights by the Nuremberg Laws, and faced intense persecution from the state. As a result, many Jewish refugees sought rapidly to emigrate out of the Reich. However, most countries, still feeling the effects of a global depression, enacted strict immigration laws and simply would not address the refugee problem. According to a census conducted in 1933, over 57 percent of the foreign Jews living in Germany were Polish. The Polish Government, fearing an influx of Jews from the Reich, took drastic steps to isolate its Jewish citizens abroad. On October 6, 1938, the Polish Ministry of Internal Affairs announced an ordinance requiring that Polish citizens living outside Poland obtain an endorsement stamp on their passports before October 30. Any passport without the stamp would become void and the owner of the passport would have his citizenship rights revoked. When thousands of Polish Jews in Germany presented their passports at Polish consular offices, they were denied the necessary stamp for various reasons. By enacting this decree and denying the stamp to Jews, the Polish Government made it clear that they had no interest in taking in Jews from the Reich, even those who were Polish citizens. The Polish decree did not please the German Government. In 1938, Nazi policy regarding the Jews was heavily centered on emigration from the Reich rather than the mass extermination that would arise in 1942 during World War II. Thus, Nazi officials saw the Polish decree as a hindrance to their attempts at forcing Jewish emigration. In a letter to Hans Lammers, Chief of the Reich Chancellery, SS Obergruppenfuhrer Werner Best wrote: Fearing the prospect of thousands of Polish Jews unable to legally emigrate from the Reich, the German Government felt that it had to act. As head of the Gestapo, Heydrich ordered that Polish Jews be expelled from the Reich. == Deportations == From October 27 until October 29, the day before the Polish decree regarding the eligibility of passports was set to take effect, state authorities in Germany arrested approximately 17,000 Polish Jews and cancelled their German permits of residence. The Gestapo was easily able to locate those arrested through registration data and census files. After being arrested, thousands of Polish Jews were stripped of any personal property or money and put on trains. These trains brought the deportees to the German- Polish border. The Polish border authorities were overwhelmed at first by the unexpected influx of people and during the first day of expulsions they allowed thousands of Polish Jews entry into Poland. However, the Polish Government quickly responded by closing the border down and denying any further access. In the city of Leipzig, some Polish Jews were able to find refuge in the Polish consulate, assisted there by the Consul General Feliks Chiczewski. By October 30, thousands of homeless Jews resided in no-man's land along the border. Historians estimate that 4,000 to 6,000 Jews were deported between the southern towns Beuthen and Kattowitz, 1,500 were placed near the northern town of Chojnice, and 8,000 were sent to the town of Zbaszyn (source 2 pp. 123). In Zbaszyn a large refugee camp was established as an attempt to give shelter to those deported. For months, refugees in Zbaszyn slept in poorly constructed barracks with very few provisions. The severity of the conditions within the camp was witnessed by Polish historian Emanuel Ringelblum who described the hopelessness of the refugees in a letter to a colleague. As a result of the Polenaktion of October 1938, most of the 17,000 expelled Jews would remain in refugee camps on the border for almost a year. It was not until just prior to the German Invasion of Poland in 1939 that the refugees of the Polenaktion gained access to Poland's interior. == Response of Herschel Grynszpan == Stolperstein of Adolf Abraham Bachner, Polenaktion survivor Among those deported on October 27 in Hanover, Germany was the family of Sendel Grynszpan. Grynszpan described police coming to their home on Thursday October 27, demanding that they go to the nearest precinct with their Polish passports. When they arrived, hundreds of people were waiting for further instructions. The police notified the crowd that they were to sign papers and present their passports. After doing so they were placed in police vans, taken to a train station, and forced onto the cars. On Saturday October 29, the Grynszpan family arrived in Zbaszyn, confused and scared. On October 31, Sendel Grynszpan's daughter Berta was able to send a post card from Zbaszyn to her brother Herschel Grynszpan in Paris. The post card, which detailed the cruelty and tragedy of the family's forced relocation reached Grynszpan. Horrified and distressed by the plight of his family and the thousands of other Polish Jews, Grynszpan took it upon himself to enact revenge. Purchasing a pistol, he went to the German Embassy in Paris on November 7. There he shot and ultimately killed First Secretary of the Reich, Ernst vom Rath. The assassination of vom Rath stunned the Nazi regime. On November 9 and 10 Jewish businesses, properties, and synagogues were destroyed, burned, and looted across the Reich, with the assassination being used by the Nazis as a pretext. This event, often referred to as Kristallnacht is often seen by historians as a key moment of significance in the formulation of the Holocaust. ==See also== *1938 deportations of Jews from Slovakia == References == ==External links== * Category:Polish Jews Category:1938 in Germany Category:Second Polish Republic Category:Refugees Category:The Holocaust in Germany Category:The Holocaust in Poland Category:Germany–Poland relations ","title":"Polenaktion"},{"id":"56624402","text":"Édouard Nignon (9 November 1865, Nantes - 30 October 1934, Bréal-sous- Montfort) was a French chef and writer of cookbooks. == Life == One of eight children of a day laborer and a seamstress, Nignon became an apprentice at Cambronne Restaurant at the age of 9. A year later, he joined Monier Restaurant, where he learned to read and write. After more work in Angers and Cholet, he arrived to Paris, where he assisted famous chefs and eventually became a chef himself. He lived in Austria and Russia, where he served the highest dignitaries, including the emperors Nicholas II of Russia and Franz Joseph I of Austria. He worked as the chef of Claridge's in London from 1894 to 1901. In 1908, he bought Larue Restaurant in Paris. He retired in 1928. When his restaurant was going through a crisis in World War I, he started writing cookbooks. His most famous cookbook, Eulogies of French Cuisine, was published in 1933. It promoted deglazing with water, clear broths, and parsimonious seasoning. Nignon is credited with inventing the beuchelle tourangelle, a veal kidney and rice stew inspired by the Austrian beuschel stew. Interested in unusual taste combinations, he created oysters with camembert and homard a la dinardaise, a lobster salad with the \\"insane trio\\" of truffles, mustard and pickles. == Legacy == Ignored by the general public, Nignon has been recognized by chefs as one of the fathers of modern cuisine. His legacy has been revived after a long period of being eclipsed by his more famous contemporary, Auguste Escoffier. Michel Guérard, one of the founders of nouvelle cuisine, described Nignon as a visionary chef who had a huge influence on French cooks such as himself and Joël Robuchon. A recent article on contemporary cookbooks called Nignon \\"the Flaubert of the ovens,\\" who created \\"gourmet epics\\". His Eulogies were called a \\"seminal book\\" of \\"bourgeois cuisine.\\" An original copy of Nignon's Heptameron was sold for 16 thousand euros in the 2010s.

He was a three-time national champion who represented Australia at the 1924 Summer Olympics in the men's eight. ==Club and state rowing== Ted Thomas was a storekeeper and his senior rowing was from the Murray Bridge Rowing Club. The Murray Bridge Rowing Club men's eight was the dominant Australian club eight of the 1920s. They won the South Australian state championship from 1920 to 1923 and in 1921 by a margin of ten lengths. For the four years from 1920 to 1923 they were selected in- toto as the South Australian men's eight to contest the King's Cup at the Australian Interstate Regatta. Thomas rowed in those crews at five in 1920 & 21 and in the two seat in 1922 & 23 and rowed in each of those South Australian King's Cup victories of 1920, 1922 and 1923,. ==International representative rowing== The South Australian media pushed for Thomas' victorious 1920 King's Cup eight to be sent to the 1920 Antwerp Olympics but with the Victorian and New South Wales Rowing Association in control of selections and funding, there wasn't sufficient support for their campaign.1920 Olympics at Austn Rowing History By 1924 with South Australia continuing to dominate Australian eights rowing, their claim could not be denied and after winning a test event raced on Port Adelaide in March 1924, Thomas and the South Australian crew were selected in-toto to represent Australia as an eight at the 1924 Summer Olympics. Funding was raised from the Murray Bridge Rowing Club, the South Australian Rowing Association and the general public of South Australia. The crew were nicknamed \\"the Murray Cods\\". Unlike the 1912 Olympic eight, the Murray Cods were not invited to race in lead-up at the Henley Royal Regatta and in 2000 Thomas' son, Ted Thomas jnr, asserted in a commemorative speech that this was because the eight was crewed by working class men other than the stroke Bill Sladden 2000 speech remembering the Murray Cods It's undisputed that tour funds were scarce and on arrival in France, the crew had to row their shell 60 km to their training base; that on tour a number of the crew (including Thomas) busked as musicians to raise pocket money; and that on race day they first rowed their shell 26 miles from their boatshed to the Olympic course. Their equipment was also sub- par as they rowed with their oars turning in out-rigged poppets rather than in swivelling gates as had become the norm by 1924. In the Olympic regatta, with Thomas in the two seat, the Australian eight finished second behind Italy in their heat, then finished third in the repechage and didn't advance to the final. Thomas did not row on after the Olympics. ==References== Category:1894 births Category:1943 deaths Category:Australian male rowers Category:Olympic rowers of Australia Category:Rowers at the 1924 Summer Olympics ","title":"Ted Thomas (rower)"},{"id":"56624411","text":"The Erebus Chalice is a silver and gilt chalice gifted to the National Science Foundation in 1987 for use in the Chapel of the Snows at McMurdo Station in Antarctica, where it is now kept on display during austral summers.

NGC 4570 was discovered by astronomer William Herschel on April 13, 1784 and is a member of the Virgo Cluster. == Structure == NGC 4570 has a nuclear disc that extends to a radius of about ~. In between the nuclear disk and the surrounding two stellar rings and the outer disk, there is a gap that separates the outer edge of the nuclear disk and the inner edge of the main disk by about ~. This multi-disc structure may have been shaped through secular evolution induced by a small nuclear bar. However, observations of the globular clusters surrounding NGC 4570 have found a significant population with ages ranging from about 1–3 billion years. Surprisingly, the estimated ages of the young globular clusters appears to be in good agreement with the estimated age of the stellar population of the nuclear disc (≤2 Gyr). This suggests that the young globular clusters and the nuclear disc instead formed from a merger or accretion event which involved significant amounts of gas and triggered a strong starburst in the galaxy. == Globular Clusters == About 120 globular clusters have been detected surrounding NGC 4570. ==See also== * List of NGC objects (4001–5000) * NGC 5866 == References == ==External links== Category:Virgo (constellation) Category:Lenticular galaxies 4570 42096 7785 Category:Astronomical objects discovered in 1784 Category:Virgo Cluster Category:Discoveries by William Herschel ","title":"NGC 4570"},{"id":"56624452","text":"Yelena Biserova (born 24 March 1962) is a Russian female former track and field hurdler who competed for the Soviet Union in the 100 metres hurdles.

The Yellow Turbans launched an uprising against the central government in 184, the year of the Jiazi in the Sexagenary cycle. The Yellow Turban Rebellion became one of the biggest rebellions in Chinese history, but it was mostly quelled within a year by the Eastern Han government. As result, the Chinese historiography has always placed it as the progenitor of the Three Kingdoms Era. Some Yellow Turban factions continued their insurgency for decades, however, and the last known remnants of the movement were defeated in the first decade of the 3rd century. ==Yellow Turban Army== The Yellow Turban Army was composed of commoners, rabble and other people of opportunity. Zhang Jue and his brothers Zhang Bao and Zhang Liang treated many of them, and thus were very popular. When Zhang Jue saw that followers of the Way of the Taiping grew more numerous by the day, he openly revolted in the large-scale Yellow Turban Rebellion. The scale of the Rebellion involved almost a million people, Zhang Jue passed away during the rebellion, with his brothers falling in battle. The Rebellion was put down within the year, but laid the foundations of the fall of the Eastern Han Dynasty. ==Impact== The Rebellion may have been put down within the year, but it laid the foundations of the fall of the Eastern Han Dynasty. The central government handed local officials immense authority with regards to the recruitment of soldiers, which resulted in the warlordism of the late Eastern Han Dynasty and the Three Kingdoms Era, undeniably a fatal blow to the Eastern Han. The Rebellion accelerated the demise of the Eastern Han, and even after the defeat of the rebellion, small scale conflicts continued under the Yellow Turban banner along the Yellow River. This is also why the Yellow Turban Rebellion is often documented in Chinese historiography as the beginning of the Three Kingdoms Era. ==Leaders== *Zhang Jue，head of the Yellow Turban Army, passed away from illness during the Rebellion. Declared himself the \\"Great Teacher\\" (大賢良師), and \\"General of Heaven\\" (天公將軍). *Zhang Bao，Zhang Jue's second youngest brother，died from a hail of arrows during battles between Eastern Han soldiers from Qing Province and Xu Province, with the army he led dissolving thereafter. Declared himself \\"General of Land\\" (地公將軍). *Zhang Liang，Zhang Jue's youngest brother，a leading general of the Yellow Turban Army. Declared himself \\"General of the People\\" (人公將軍). ==Notable Individuals== *Ma Yuanyi (馬元義)，in the early days of the Yellow Turban Rebellion, Ma led tens of thousands of the Yellow Turban Army in secret, and plotted with close officials (Zhong Chang Shi 中常侍) of the Emperor to rise up in Ye. The plot leaked and he was pulled apart by chariots in Luoyang. *Zhang Mancheng (張曼成)，Zhang was from Nanyang, and he rose up with tens of thousands of the Yellow Turban Army, killing the Junshou (Jun Governor), Chu Gong 褚貢. Two months later he was in turn killed by the newly appointed Taishou of Nanyang, Qin Jie 秦頡. *Zhao Hong (趙弘)，after the death of Zhang Mancheng, Zhao Hong became the leader of his faction of the Yellow Turban Army. Zhao occupied and held Wancheng, but was killed in a shock attack led by Zhu Jun. *Han Zhong (韓忠)，after the death of Zhao Hong, Han Zhong led the remainder of his faction of the Yellow Turban Army, and reoccupied Wancheng, holding out against Zhu Jun. Zhu caught Han in a surprise attack and Han surrendered. Han was killed in a fit of rage by Qin Jie. *Sun Xia (孫夏)，after the death of Han Zhong, Sun Xia became the commander of Han's Yellow Turban Army remains. He led the defence of Wancheng against Zhu Jun, only to fall in battle. This faction of the Yellow Turban Army thus dispersed. *Bo Cai (波才)，Bo Cai defeated Zhu Jun in battle. A month later, the combined forces of Huangfu Song and Zhu Jun won a great victory against Bo. *Peng Tuo (彭脫)，Huangfu Song and Zhu Jun chased Peng's Yellow Turban Army in Xihua, and shattered it. *Luo Ji (卜己)，Huangfu Song and Zhu Jun then went on to engage Luo Ji's Yellow Turban Army, which was based in Dong Jun, near present-day Puyang. Huang and Zhu caught up to Luo's Army near Cangting, north of present-day Yanggu County, Shandong, and managed to capture Luo alive, decapitating over 7,000 of his soldiers. ==Beihai Jun Yellow Turbans== *Zhang Rao (張饒)，led 200,000 Yellow Turbans from Ji Province, and defeated Kong Rong in battle. *Guan Hai (管亥)，Guan besieged Kong Rong, and this led Kong to send Taishi Ci from Donglai Commandery (東萊郡) to request the then Chancellor (相) of Pingyuan State (平原國) Liu Bei for aid. == White Wave Bandits == * Guo Tai(郭泰)，Between 16 March and 13 April 188, Guo Tai (郭太) led some 100,000 Yellow Turban remnants to start a rebellion in Xihe Commandery (西河郡; around present-day Fenyang, Shanxi). As they originated from Baibo Valley (白波谷; \\"White Wave Valley\\") in Xihe Commandery, they later became known as the \\"White Wave Bandits\\" (白波賊). They allied with the Xiongnu leader Yufuluo and attacked Taiyuan Commandery (太原郡; around present-day Taiyuan, Shanxi) and Hedong Commandery (河東郡; around present-day Yuncheng, Shanxi).([中平五年二月， ...]黃巾餘賊郭太等起於西河白波谷，寇太原、河東。) Houhanshu vol. 8.(魏書曰：於夫羅者，南單于子也。中平中，發匈奴兵，於夫羅率以助漢。會本國反，殺南單于，於夫羅遂將其衆留中國。因天下撓亂，與西河白波賊合，破太原、河內，抄略諸郡為寇。) Wei Shu annotation in Sanguozhi vol. 1.

Garshin (Памяти В. М. Гаршина), published in Saint Petersburg in January of that year. In a revised version it made its way into another collection, Moody People (Хмурые люди, Khmurye lyudi, 1890). With some further edits, Chekhov included it into Volume 5 of his Collected Works, published by Adolf Marks in 1899–1901. During its author's lifetime the story was translated into German, Serbo-Croatian and Swedish languages.Commentaries to Припадок Чехов А. П. Припадок // А. П.

Повести], 1888—1891. — М.: Наука, 1977 . — С. 199—221. ==Plot summary== Vasilyev, a law student, is persuaded by his friends Meyer and Rybnikov to take an evening cruise through the Lane, a red light district in Moscow. As they move from one brothel to another, Vasilyev gets more and more distressed with what he sees. Disgusted with the general air of apathy and indifference, he tries to strike up conversations with the women but is shocked by the dullness of the response. His attempts at constructing a more or less logical picture of the inner mechanism of this place, and the motivations behind it, fail too. Vasilyev returns home overwhelmed with the feelings of guilt, shame and disgust. Here, feeling the symptoms of the approaching nervous breakdown, a condition familiar to him, he spends a sleepless night trying to come up with some kind of project to 'save' all those women who apparently fail to see that they have been reduced to the status of animals. Two days later, delirious and mumbling of suicide, he is delivered by his friends to the psychiatrist Mikhail Sergeyevich. Vasilyev tries to speak about the plight of those 'fallen' women, but gets lukewarm response from the specialist. Still, the prolonged talk, combined with some medicine he takes, make him feel better. He departs, with the receipts for potassium bromide and morphine. More or less calmed down, he feels confused and quite ashamed of his unnecessary outbreak. ==Background== Garshin in 1885 In March 1888 Russia was shocked by the news of the tragic death of Vsevolod Garshin. The writer, noted for his sensitivity to social injustice and great compassion to suffering people, died in hospital five days after he threw himself down the stairwell from the fourth floor of the house he lived in.Garshin biography at the Brockhaus and Efron Encyclopedic dictionary Almost immediately two groups of writers started to collect money for the Garshin monument, as well as literary tributes. One, centered around the newspaper Novosti, was headed by Kazimir Barantsevich, another, organized by the staff of Severny Vestnik, by Alexey Pleshcheyev. On 19 March Barantsevich asked Chekhov by post to contribute to the collection. \\"Whatever you will, regardless whether it had been published before or not, anything would be welcome,\\" he wrote. The following day Chekhov sent an enthusiastic reply, promising to \\"send something for the collection\\" and noting that such ideas, \\"beside their direct goal, serve as a uniting force for the writers' community which, even if not numerous, are still disparate. The more shoulder to shoulder feeling we'll have, the more we'll support each other, the sooner we'll learn to value and respect one another.\\"Мысль Ваша заслуживает и сочувствия, и уважения уж по одному тому, что подобные мысли, помимо их прямой цели, служат еще связующим цементом для немногочисленной, но живущей вразброс и в одиночку пишущей братии. Чем больше сплоченности, взаимной поддержки, тем скорее мы научимся уважать и ценить друг друга... On 30 March Pleshcheyev too asked Chekhov to provide some work for his tribute to Garshin, mentioning the Novosti-related project, in a rather negative light, characterizing it as superficial. For a time being the hope remained that the two parties would join forces, then the disagreements became obvious and Chekhov in another letter to Pleshcheyev expressed his disappointment with the split. Still, he decided to respond to the latter's request and ignore the Barantsevich-edited collection.It was called Krasny Tsvetok (Red Flower) and came out in Saint Petersburg in 1889 without any contribution by Chekhov. On 15 September Chekhov wrote to Pleshcheyev: \\"It would be a shame for me to fail to respond to your request, for... [people like Garshin] are very dear to me... But I do not have not a single [story at the moment] that would fit such a collection... Probably just one little idea: a young man, a Garshin type, strong personality, honest and deeply sensitive, finds himself in a brothel for the first time in his life. Serious things demand serious treatment, so I intend to be quite straightforward about it. But what if I will be able to make it a depressive read, which is indeed my intention, and it will turn out good enough to make into the collection? Can you guarantee, that the censors or the editorial staff itself won't throw away from it things that I myself regard as important?.. If you can, I promise to write the story in the course of two evenings.\\"...Впрочем, есть у меня еще одна тема: молодой человек гаршинской закваски, недюжинный, честный и глубоко чуткий, попадает первый раз в жизни в дом терпимости. Так как о серьезном нужно говорить серьезно, то в рассказе этом все вещи будут названы настоящими их именами. Быть может, мне удастся написать его так, что он произведет, как бы я хотел, гнетущее впечатление; быть может, он выйдет хорош и сгодится для сборника, но поручитесь ли Вы, милый, что цензура или сама редакция не выхватят из него то, что в нем я считаю за важное? <...> Если поручитесь, что ни одно слово не будет вычеркнуто, то я напишу рассказ в два вечера. Pleshcheyev's 1888 portrait by Nikolai Yaroshenko In response, Pleshcheyev promised \\"that will be an uncensored collection\\" and not a single word will be changed by the editors. On 9 October 1888 Chekhov informed Pleshcheyev that he was going to start writing the next day, and will finish it in a week. Yet it took him a month to complete the story. \\"You are killing us... For God's sake, please hurry up,\\" Pleshcheyev implored him in the 2 November letter. \\"The work is on its way, and 1/4 of it is ready... I describe here the Sobolev Lane with its brothels, but carefully, without wallowing in mud or resorting to strong language,\\" Chekhov assured him on 3 November. On November 10, he added: \\"I try to be modest, to the point of boredom. The subject matter seems to me to be so delicate, that any detail could be easily exaggerated into elephantine proportions. I hope my story won't stick out of this collection's general picture. It is sad, dour and serious.\\"Я пишу и всё время стараюсь быть скромным, скромным до скуки. Предмет, как мне кажется, настолько щекотлив, что малейший пустяк может показаться слоном. Думаю, что рассказ не будет резко выделяться из общего тона сборника. Он у меня грустный, скучный и серьезный. On 11 November in a letter to Alexey Suvorin he wrote: \\"Today I finished the story for the Garshin memorial collection, and that's huge relief... Why don't you ever say anything in your newspaper about prostitution? For it is a horrible evil. Our Sobolev Lane is a slave market.\\" Finally, on 13 November the story was sent to Pleshcheyev. \\"By no means a family read, very ungracious... But my conscience is now clear. The promise fulfilled, besides, I gave the late Garshin the kind of credit I wanted to, and was capable of. As a medic, I think I've described this psychological ailment the right way, in terms of the psychological science. As for the girls, in the days gone by I used to be quite an authority in this matter.\\"Рассказ совсем не подходящий для альманашно-семейного чтения, неграциозный и отдает сыростью водосточных труб. Но совесть моя по крайней мере покойна: во-первых, обещание сдержал, во- вторых, воздал покойному Гаршину ту дань, какую хотел и умел. Мне, как медику, кажется, что душевную боль я описал правильно, по всем правилам психиатрической науки. Что касается девок, то по этой части я во времена оны был большим специалистом. Upon receiving \\"A Nervous Breakdown\\", Pleshcheyev sent Chekhov a letter. \\"I liked this story for its seriousness, reserve, and the idea as such. Still we are here all wary of censorship, it does not like this subject being touched at all. Guards chastity with all the severity.\\" His premonitions as to possible problems with censorship proved right later, in 1902, when the fifth volume of the Collected Works by A.P. Chekhov published by Marks, was banned from public libraries and reading-halls, and \\"A Nervous Breakdown\\" was cited among the three short stories deemed politically incorrect. \\"[It] sermonizes against prostitution, but at the same time implies that any single man's attempts to fight this evil are doomed to be futile,\\" a member of the Education ministry's Scientific committee Evgraf Kovalevsky explained. ==Critical reception== In general, the story was positively reviewed. Among those who lauded it were Ivan Gorbunov-Posadov and Dmitry Grigorovich, who on 27 December 1888 sent Chekhov a letter containing a thorough analysis of the novella (as he called it). He praised the story's \\"noble humanism\\" as well as the descriptions of nature. \\"The literary community, students, Evreyinova, Pleshcheyev, women and others praised my Breakdown to high heavens, but only Grigorovich spotted the first snow episode,\\" wrote Chekhov in his 23 December 1888 letter to Suvorin. Later, in the 3 January letter, he enquired: \\"Why haven’t you spoken a single word on In the Memory of Garshin? This is unfair.\\" Whether Suvorin replied by letter or not, is unknown, but Novoye Vremya, which originally ignored the compilation, responded in its own way, by publishing in January 1889 a negative review,Новое время, 1889, № 4632, 20 января. by Viktor Burenin, which outraged Pleshcheyev. On 22 December 1888 Novosti i Birzhevaya Gazeta (The News and the Stockbroker Gazette) briefly commented on the release of both of the Garshin tributes. \\"Even if no masterpieces are to be found in them, you'll come across fine stories as \\"Raven the Petitioner\\" by Shchedrin, \\"Nervous Breakdown\\" by An. Chekhov or \\"On the Volga\\" by V. Korolenko which you'll read with delight,\\" Alexander Skabichevsky wrote. There were two reviews (on 29 December 1888, and 5 January 1889) of the collection in Novosti Dnya (News of the Day), both pointing at \\"Nervous Breakdown\\" as its strongest piece. After the third edition of the Moody People collection came out, the magazine Trud reviewed it, again pointing at \\"A Nervous Breakdown\\" as its outstanding feature. ==References== ==External links== * Припадок, the original Russian text * A Nervous Breakdown, English translation Category:Short stories by Anton Chekhov Category:1889 short stories Category:Works about prostitution in Russia ","title":"A Nervous Breakdown"},{"id":"56624595","text":"Carey is a given name.

PopSockets LLC is a privately owned consumer-electronics accessory company that produces removable grips for smartphones. The company was founded in 2012 by David Barnett, who was at the time a philosophy professor. ==Overview== In 2014, the first year of sales, PopSockets LLC sold 30,000 PopSockets grips. In 2017, PopSockets LLC sold 35 million PopSockets grips. In 2018, PopSockets LLC sold 60 million PopSockets grips. They have sold a total of over 100 million Popsockets grips. In 2018, PopSockets LLC's revenue was over US$200 million, with a profit of over US$90 million. In August 2018, PopSockets LLC was listed as #2 on the Inc. 5000 list of the fastest-growing companies in America. PopSockets LLC employs over 200 people, in Boulder, San Francisco, Finland, and Singapore. PopSockets LLC has partnerships with production facilities in China, South Korea, Mexico, and Seattle. In 2020 Popsockets are now no longer on the market replaced by PopGrips at a higher price. ==History== In January 2012, Barnett started a Kickstarter campaign for an iPhone 4 case with a device on the back that could be used to store earbuds. In March 2012, Barnett signed an exclusive licensing agreement with Case-Mate, but the agreement later fell through. Because of the resulting delay, Barnett announced in September 2012 that he would be developing an iPhone 5 case instead of an iPhone 4 case. He also announced that he would be developing a product that, at the time, was called \\"PopSockets for All\\"—this is a PopSockets grip that sticks to one's phone or tablet via a repositionable sticky gel pad. He was interested in finding a way to store his headphones without them getting tangled. This individual PopSockets grip has been the best-selling product of the company. PopSockets LLC started selling products in January 2014, via direct sales on its website. In 2015, PopSockets LLC signed its first major retail deal, with T-Mobile. PopSockets reached a high level of popularity in 2017, becoming what Slate Magazine called a well-known \\"love it or hate it\\" gadget, like the fidget spinner. PopSockets LLC's revenue grew by 71,424 percent from mid-2015 to mid-2018; this growth was achieved without venture capital investment. In March 2019, PopSockets LLC moved its headquarters to a 46,000-square-foot building in Boulder, Colorado. ==Early controversy== PopSockets grips were featured on a September 2012 segment of NPR's radio show All Things Considered, entitled \\"When A Kickstarter Campaign Fails, Does Anyone Get The Money Back?\\". The segment discussed how Barnett refunded 40 of his 500 Kickstarter backers, due to the delays in production. Regarding the refunds, Barnett was quoted as saying \\"I think it sets a bad precedent. ... Once I did that, I could tell that it started creating the impression in some of my backers that they had purchased an item. And I think as Kickstarter grows, there's more and more of an impression that it's just a big store for people to go get deals.\\" Barnett's production delays were also discussed on CNN. ==Products== The main product sold by PopSockets LLC is the PopSockets grip. The PopSockets grip is designed to allow easier handling of the phone. The PopSockets grip also functions as a stand, to prop a phone up while watching video. PopSockets LLC also sells the PopSockets mount, which enables one to temporarily mount one's phone on a vertical surface, such as a car dashboard or wall. In February 2018, the company started selling the PopSockets vent mount, which clips onto the air vent of a vehicle. PopSockets LLC also sells PopMinis (miniature PopSockets grips, sold in sets of three), and PopWallets (designed to hold up to three credit cards or driver's licenses). In October 2018, the company started selling swappable PopSockets grips, called \\"PopGrips\\", where the top portion of the grip, called a \\"PopTop\\", can be removed and replaced with another PopTop. Starting in Spring of 2019, in conjunction with Otterbox, PopSockets LLC will be selling the Otter+Pop phone case, an Otterbox case with an integrated PopTop. This case won a USA Today CES Editors' Choice award. PopSockets LLC has plans in the future to sell swappable grips with integrated external batteries, sensors, and trackers. PopSockets LLC announced plans for making products compatible with the iPhone 12 mag safe feature. == Intellectual property protection == PopSockets LLC has faced significant problems with counterfeits (fakes branded as \\"PopSockets\\") and knock-offs (which don't use the term \\"PopSockets\\", but copy the design of PopSockets grips and hence violate patents). In 2017 and 2018, PopSockets LLC's brand protection team was working with online marketplaces around the world to remove 1,000 to 2,000 listings daily. Amazon had to develop new protocols to deal with the volume of fake PopSockets grips on the Amazon Marketplace. In 2018, PopSockets LLC spent over US$7 million on intellectual property protection, working with over 40 lawyers worldwide. In June 2018, PopSockets LLC won a General Exclusion Order (GEO) from the US International Trade Commission, prohibiting the importation into America of products that infringe on PopSockets's 2013 patent entitled \\"Extending Socket for Portable Media Player\\". == Amazon dispute == In November 2018, PopSockets LLC stopped selling PopSockets grips on amazon.com, due to pricing disputes with Amazon. Amazon changed its policy, so that brands like PopSockets could not sell directly on the Amazon Marketplace, but could only sell items to Amazon at wholesale cost; Amazon would then be the seller and determine the retail cost. PopSockets LLC wanted to maintain pricing parity with other retailers (like Target and Best Buy) who sell PopSockets grips, and as a result PopSockets LLC decided not to sell PopSockets grips to Amazon at all. == Philanthropy == In November 2018, PopSockets LLC launched a major philanthropic program called \\"Poptivism\\", where for each PopSockets grip sold through the Poptivism platform, 50% of the sale is donated to the non-profit assigned to it by its creator. One of the celebrities who has promoted a Poptivism grip is the American actress and singer Zendaya; sales from her grip support the charity FoodCorps. PopSockets LLC also partnered with Teen Vogue to support the gun violence charity March for Our Lives. In the past PopSockets LLC was a \\"Let's Get a Grip on Arthritis\\" sponsor, and donated 10 percent of its online net proceeds from January through March 2018 to the Arthritis Foundation. PopSockets LLC received recognition from the Arthritis Foundation for the utility of PopSockets grips for people with arthritis. For April through June 2018, PopSockets LLC donated 10 percent of its online net proceeds to Craig Hospital (which helps patients with spinal cord injury and traumatic brain injury rehabilitation).

The dispute followed remarks made by Turkey's foreign minister Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu, rejecting a 2003 Cypriot-Egyptian maritime border demarcation deal and announcing the Turkish government's intention to carry out gas exploration in the region. Tensions in the region further escalated on February 9, when the Turkish Navy blocked a drill ship operated by Italian oil company Eni S.p.A, licensed by the government of the Republic of Cyprus, from exploring gas reserves off the island. Çavuşoğlu said during his interview with the Greek newspaper Kathimerini that Turkish Cypriots have \\"undeniable rights\\" to the Cypriot EEZ. Egypt's Foreign Ministry reacted by warning Turkey not to contest the 2013 deal and Egyptian economic interests in the region, adding that any attempts to do so would be confronted. The Cypriot government officials have emphasised that any future benefits are for all Cypriots, including the Turkish Cypriots, but only after a comprehensive settlement of the Cyprus problem. On February 16, Eni CEO Claudio Descalzi stated that the Turkish blockade of its drill ship, Saipem 12000, was out of Eni's hands and that the issue was being discussed by involved parties. In November 2018, the partnership of the Cypriot government and US company ExxonMobil successfully began carrying out hydrocarbon exploration, escorted by US Navy ships, with Turkey remaining passive. ==Background== In the early 1970s, the Republic of Cyprus (RoC) gave oil companies permission to search the island's waters for hydrocarbons, and the first exploration started in 1977. Earlier, in 1974, Turkey invaded Cyprus, leaving in its wake an unresolved ethnic dispute and the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (TRNC) occupying the northern part of the island, which is only recognized by Turkey. In 2002, the Turkish Navy prevented Northern Alliance, a ship operated by a RoC-commissioned Norwegian company, from exploring the Cypriot EEZ. In 2003, the governments of Cyprus and Egypt signed maritime border agreement delineating their respective EEZs. Cyprus also signed a similar agreement with the government of Lebanon in January 2007. Later that same month, the RoC defined thirteen zones (named \\"Blocks\\") in its EEZ, and invited tenders for eleven of them in the following months. Turkey, a non-signatory to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, claims Block 3 of the Cypriot EEZ as part of its continental shelf. In November 2008, a Turkish Navy vessel was involved in a standoff with two ships operated by Norwegian company Petroleum Geo-Services, a day before the Turkish Petroleum Corporation was given Ankara's permission to explore waters claimed by the Cypriot government. Three days later, the RoC found Malene Ostervold, a Norwegian-flagged ship commissioned by Turkey, surveying the region's waters. Ankara believes the Turkish Cypriot community should be allowed to benefit from the island's offshore resources. In 2014, Turkey deployed two warships to the Cypriot EEZ and started conducting seismic surveys in the region. Cypriot president Nicos Anastasiades responded by suspending unification talks with his Turkish Cypriot counterpart, Derviş Eroğlu. During a trilateral summit with Cyprus in Cairo, Egypt and Greece expressed their disapproval of the Turkish moves. They also outlined plans for energy cooperation in the eastern Mediterranean. Ankara responded by stating that the Turkish Navy would apply the rules of engagement should it encounter any warship in the region. In 2015, the Zohr Field was discovered by Eni in the Egyptian EEZ, setting off a gas exploration race in the eastern Mediterranean. Zohr also revived the Cypriot gas industry's potential to be part of regional projects, such as a gas pipeline to Europe. Other initiatives include a pipeline to Egypt's decommissioned liquefaction plants and shipping the produced liquefied natural gas (LNG) from Egyptian terminals to foreign markets. ==Timeline== The 2018 Cyprus gas dispute began on February 6, 2018. The dispute followed remarks made by Turkey's foreign minister Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu, rejecting a 2003 Cypriot-Egyptian maritime border demarcation deal and announcing the Turkish government's intention to carry out gas exploration in the region.

On November 16, the partnership of the Cypriot government and US company ExxonMobil successfully began carrying out hydrocarbon exploration, escorted by US Navy ships, with Turkey remaining passive. The Turkish Foreign Ministry responded with a statement in which its spokesman, Hami Aksoy, vowed that Turkey would begin drilling operations of its own in Cypriot waters. Meral Aksener, a prominent opposition leader and head of the İyi Party, addressed the Turkish parliament calling for a repeated invasion of Cyprus saying \\"You should know that if need be 'Ayşe will go on holiday again'\\", a reference to the code phrase that was used as a signal for the 1974 invasion. She additionally said that \\"Cyprus is Turkish and will remain Turkish\\". In July 2019, the European Council adopted the following conclusions on the Turkish drilling activities in the Eastern Mediterranean: * Calls again on Turkey to act in a spirit of good neighbourliness and respect the sovereignty and sovereign rights of Cyprus in accordance with international law. * Welcomes the invitation by the Government of Cyprus to negotiate with Turkey on delimitation of exclusive economic zones and the continental shelf through dialogue and in full respect of international law. * The EU remains fully committed to supporting the UN-led efforts to work with the parties with a view to creating the conditions conducive to resuming negotiations on a comprehensive settlement of the Cyprus problem. * To suspend negotiations on the Comprehensive air transport agreement and not to hold further meetings of the EU-Turkey high-level dialogues. * The Council endorses the Commission's proposal to reduce the pre- accession assistance to Turkey for 2020 and invites the European Investment Bank to review its lending activities in Turkey. * In accordance with the European Council conclusions of 20 June, invites the High Representative and the Commission to continue work on options for targeted measures in light of Turkey's continued drilling activities. * The Council will closely monitor developments and will revert to this issue as appropriate.\\" ==See also== * Aphrodite gas field * Zohr field * Leviathan gas field * Tamar gas field * Noble Energy * Greece–Israel relations * Cyprus–Egypt relations * Cyprus–Israel relations ==Notes== ==References== Category:Cyprus–Turkey relations Category:Egypt–Turkey relations Category:Disputed waters Category:Natural gas field disputes Category:2018 in Cyprus Category:2018 in Turkey Category:2018 in Egypt Category:Cyprus dispute ","title":"2018 Cyprus gas dispute"},{"id":"56625192","text":"Silvio Enrique Conrado Gómez (18 February 1945 – 17 February 2018) was the Nicaraguan director of the Central American Bank for Economic Integration (BCIE) serving from 2002 until his death.

He was a dual Australian champion who represented Australia at the 1924 Summer Olympics in the men's eight rowing crew. ==Club and state rowing== Tauber was employed as a fireman on the South Australian Railways and his senior rowing was from the Murray Bridge Rowing Club. The Murray Bridge Rowing Club men's eight was the dominant Australian club eight of the 1920s. They had won the South Australian state championship from 1920 to 1923 and for the four years from 1920 to 1923 they were selected in-toto as the South Australian men's eight to contest the King's Cup at the Australian Interstate Regatta. Tauber secured the five seat in the Murray Bridge eight of 1922 and rowed in those South Australian King's Cup victories of 1922 and 1923,. ==International representative rowing== In 1924 with South Australia continuing to dominate Australian eights rowing, their claim for national Olympic selection could not be denied and after winning a test event raced on Port Adelaide in March 1924, Tauber and the South Australian crew were selected in-toto to represent Australia as an eight at the 1924 Summer Olympics. Funding was raised from the Murray Bridge Rowing Club, the South Australian Rowing Association and the general public of South Australia. The crew were nicknamed \\"the Murray Cods\\". Unlike the 1912 Olympic eight, the Murray Cods were not invited to race in lead-up at the Henley Royal Regatta and in 2000 Ted Thomas jnr a crew member's son, asserted that this was because the eight was crewed by working class men other than the stroke Bill Sladden It's undisputed that tour funds were scarce and on arrival in France, the crew had to row their shell 60 km to their training base; that on tour some of the crew busked as musicians to raise pocket money; and that on race day they first rowed their shell 26 miles from their boatshed to the Olympic course. Their equipment was also sub-par as they rowed with their oars turning in out- rigged poppets rather than in swivelling gates as had become the norm by 1924. In the Olympic regatta, with Tauber in the five seat, the Australian eight finished second behind Italy in their heat, then finished third in the repechage and didn't advance to the final. Tauber did not row on after the Olympics. ==ReferencesCategory:1887 births Category:1961 deaths Category:Australian male rowers Category:Olympic rowers of Australia Category:Rowers at the 1924 Summer Olympics ","title":"Alf Taeuber"},{"id":"56625216","text":"Eldar Salihović (; born 17 June 1999) is a Montenegrin alpine skier.

He first learned to play mandolin and guitar and then, inspired by his older brother's diverse music collection, began to experiment with composing electronic music. After a period of prolifically self-releasing experimental music, Leonard's full length album Bowler Hat Soup was released in 2012 on Hand of Glory Records to some acclaim, receiving notable endorsement from DJ Marc Riley of BBC Radio 6 Music. His subsequent LP Grapefruit (2016), released on Moshi Moshi Records, likewise received critical acclaim. Leonard's music notably references a wide variety of literature, historical figures and geographical locations: his 2017 LP Derevaun Seraun documented a collection of pieces commissioned by Manchester Central Library inspired by works by James Joyce, Albert Camus, Henry Miller, Clarice Lispector and Manuel Bandeira, while Grapefruit makes reference to Ondör Gongor, Caiaphas, the Bilderberg Group, Lagavulin and Werner Herzog, Bowler Hat Soup to Friedrich Nietzsche, Brunswick Street, Port Ainé and Bora Bora, Thread Colours (2015) to Franz Kafka and Windermere, and Garden in Bermuda (2016) to Annie Edson Taylor and Coyoacán. He has cited musicians such as Frank Zappa, Richard Dawson, The Mars Volta and Kate Bush as important influences on his music.

It is an alternative to Denavit–Hartenberg parameterization. While the latter method uses the minimal number of parameters to represent joint motions, the former method has a number of advantages: uniform treatment of prismatic and revolute joints, definition of only two reference frames, and an easy geometric interpretation from the use of screw axes for each joint. The POE method was introduced by Roger W. Brockett in 1984. ==Method== The following method is used to determine the product of exponentials for a kinematic chain, with the goal of parameterizing an affine transformation matrix between the base and tool frames in terms of the joint angles \\\\theta_1...\\\\theta_N. ===Define \\"zero configuration\\"=== The first step is to select a \\"zero configuration\\" where all the joint angles are defined as being zero. The 4x4 matrix g_{st}(0) describes the transformation from the base frame to the tool frame in this configuration. It is an affine transform consisting of the 3x3 rotation matrix R and the 1x3 translation vector p. The matrix is augmented to create a 4x4 square matrix. g_{st}(0) = \\\\left[ \\\\begin{array}{cc} R & p \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{array} \\\\right] ===Calculate matrix exponential for each joint=== The following steps should be followed for each of N joints to produce an affine transform for each. ====Define the origin and axis of action==== For each joint of the kinematic chain, an origin point q and an axis of action are selected for the zero configuration, using the coordinate frame of the base. In the case of a prismatic joint, the axis of action v is the vector along which the joint extends; in the case of a revolute joint, the axis of action ω the vector normal to the rotation. ====Find twist for each joint==== A 1x6 twist vector is composed to describe the movement of each joint. For a revolute joint,\\\\xi_i=\\\\left(\\\\begin{array}{c} - \\\\omega_i \\\\times q_i \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\omega_i \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{array}\\\\right) . For a prismatic joint,\\\\xi_i=\\\\left(\\\\begin{array}{c} v_i \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{array}\\\\right) . The resulting twist has two 1x3 vector components: Linear motion along an axis (v) and rotational motion along the same axis (ω).\\\\xi= \\\\left(\\\\begin{array}{c} v \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\omega \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{array}\\\\right). ====Calculate rotation matrix==== The 3x1 vector ω is rewritten in cross product matrix notation: \\\\hat{\\\\omega} = \\\\left[ \\\\begin{array}{ccc} 0 & -\\\\omega_3 & \\\\omega_2 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\omega_3 & 0 & -\\\\omega_1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ -\\\\omega_2 & \\\\omega_1 & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{array} \\\\right]. Per Rodrigues' rotation formula, the rotation matrix is calculated from the rotational component:e^{\\\\hat{\\\\omega} \\\\theta} = I + \\\\hat{\\\\omega}\\\\sin{\\\\theta} + \\\\hat{\\\\omega}^2(1-\\\\cos{\\\\theta}). ====Calculate translation==== The 3x1 translation vector is calculated from the components of the twist. t = (I-e^{\\\\hat{\\\\omega} \\\\theta})(\\\\omega \\\\times v) + \\\\omega \\\\omega^T v \\\\theta where I is the 3x3 identity matrix. ====Compose matrix exponential==== For each joint i, the matrix exponential e^{\\\\hat{\\\\xi}_{i} \\\\theta _{i}} for a given joint angle \\\\theta is composed from the rotation matrix and translation vector, combined into an augmented 4x4 matrix:e^{\\\\hat{\\\\xi}_{i} \\\\theta _{i}} = \\\\left[ \\\\begin{array}{cc} e^{\\\\hat{\\\\omega} \\\\theta} & t \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{array} \\\\right] ===Compose structure equation=== The matrix exponentials are multiplied to produce a 4 × 4 affine transform g_d(\\\\theta_i,\\\\ldots,\\\\theta_n) from the base frame to the tool frame in a given configuration.g_d=e^{\\\\hat{\\\\xi}_1\\\\theta_1}\\\\cdots e^{\\\\hat{\\\\xi}_n\\\\theta_n}g_{st}(0). ==Application to kinematics== Forward kinematics may be computed directly from the POE chain for a given manipulator. Inverse kinematics for most common robot manipulators can be solved with the use of Paden–Kahan subproblems. ==Relationship to Denavit–Hartenberg parameters== ===Advantages=== The product of exponentials method uses only two frames of reference: the base frame S and the tool frame T. Constructing the Denavit–Hartenberg parameters for a robot requires the careful selection of tool frames in order to enable particular cancellations, such that the twists can be represented by four parameters instead of six. In the product of exponentials method, the joint twists can be constructed directly without considering adjacent joints in the chain. This makes the joint twists easier to construct, and easier to process by computer. In addition, revolute and prismatic joints are treated uniformly in the POE method, while they are treated separately when using the Denavit–Hartenberg parameters. Moreover, there are multiple conventions for assigning link frames when using the Denavit–Hartenberg parameters. ===Conversion=== There is not a one-to-one mapping between twist coordinate mapping in both methods, but algorithmic mapping from POE to Denavit–Hartenberg has been demonstrated. ==Application to parallel robots== When analyzing parallel robots, the kinematic chain of each leg is analyzed individually and the tool frames are set equal to one another. This method is extensible to grasp analyses. ==References== Category:Robotics ","title":"Product of exponentials formula"},{"id":"56625628","text":"This is a list of all personnel changes for the 1958 NBA off-season and 1958-59 NBA season. ==Events== ===August 5, 1958=== * The St. Louis Hawks traded Wayne Embry, Jim Palmer, Darrell Floyd, Gerry Calvert and Ken Sidle to the Cincinnati Royals for Clyde Lovellette.

He designed many buildings in Tennessee, including homes, churches, military installations, skyscrapers, hospitals and school buildings, some of which are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. He is best known for Nashville's landmark Life and Casualty Tower built in 1957 which was the tallest commercial structure in the Southeastern United States at that time (31 stories). It reflected an architectural turn to modernism and was one of the first buildings emphasizing energy efficiency. Keeble had a preference for designing tall slender church steeples, nicknamed \\"Keeble's needles\\" by architecture critics. He briefly taught architecture at the University of Pennsylvania before settling in Nashville. He was one of the founders of the \\"Nashville Architectural Studio\\" during the 1920s and 1930s. His efforts to establish a school of architecture at Vanderbilt University were unsuccessful. ==Early life== Edwin A. Keeble was born August 18, 1905, in Monteagle, Tennessee, a town on the Cumberland Plateau in the southeast corner of Tennessee on a direct path between Nashville and Chattanooga. Monteagle was the family's summer home, the primary home being Nashville. He was the fourth of six children. His father, John Bell Keeble, was the dean of the Vanderbilt University Law School. His mother was Emmie Frazer. His maternal great- grandfather, John Bell, was a U.S.senator and was U.S. Secretary of War in 1841 under President William Henry Harrison. Bell was an 1860 U.S. Presidential candidate. Keeble's paternal grandfather, Edwin Augustus Keeble, was Speaker of the Tennessee House of Representatives, Mayor of Murfreesboro, and represented Tennessee in the Confederate Congress of 1864. Keeble grew up in his father's house at 2114 West End Avenue in Nashville, across the street from the Vanderbilt University Campus— within sight of Kissam Hall. His early schooling was at the Wallace University School, which was a block from his house. His high school was Montgomery Bell Academy, where his father had attended; it was a straight three-mile trolley ride down West End Avenue. He graduated in 1921 and went on to Vanderbilt University, where he earned a bachelor's degree in engineering in 1924. He studied architecture at the University of Pennsylvania with Paul Philippe Cret, a Frenchman who had trained in Lyon and Paris in the Beaux-Arts tradition. This association influenced Keeble to spend the summer of 1926 studying in France at the Ecole des Hautes Etudes Artistiques at Fontainebleau. The next year he studied with Georges Gromort at the École nationale supérieure des Beaux-Arts in Paris. He then traveled through France and Italy observing architectural styles before returning to the University of Pennsylvania to complete his architecture degree in 1928. ==Early career== On completion of his studies, Keeble returned to Nashville and for a brief period, worked for architect Donald Southgate and for a Los Angeles architect named Kenneth McDonald Jr. In 1929 he joined Francis Bodie Warfield, forming the firm of Warfield & Keeble, with whom he practiced for the next 15 years . Warfield, known as \\"Dolly\\", graduated from Vanderbilt in 1915. He was about 14 years older than Keeble, and had served during the First World War in France with the 105th Engineers Corps. Warfield was primarily an engineer, and his major solo works were two housing projects, Cheatham Place and the Andrew Jackson; Vanderbilt University's Rand Hall (1952), the First Presbyterian Church, and the Springfield Woolen Mills. With Keeble, they designed McTyeire Hall in 1940 (Vanderbilt's first women's residence hall on campus) and Westminster Presbyterian Church. Warfield was a commissioner and Vice-Mayor of Belle Meade but had to resign in 1957 for health reasons before finishing his term. In 1964, Warfield was honored with a citation by the American Institute of Architects for his efforts \\"...to establish architecture as a significant art form\\". Throughout the 1930s, their firm was quite active and they designed college dormitories, schools, churches and many private homes. When World War II was raging in Europe, Congress authorized the president to federalize the National Guard; as a result, National Guard Armories were needed on a grand scale. Warfield and Keeble received a commission from the State of Tennessee, with partial funding from the Works Progress Administration, to design and supervise the construction of National Guard Armories (see photo) in six Tennessee cities: Columbia, Lawrenceburg, Cookeville, Shelbyville, Centerville and Murfreesboro. Each armory took a year or two to build and kept them busy up until the U.S. entry into the war. Warfield and Keeble also designed houses like the P. D. Houston Jr. House in Forest Hills in 1941, which is listed on the National Register of Historic Places; With . but with the advent of the war, Keeble entered the military in 1944, at age 39, and this effectively dissolved their association. Stationed in Washington, D.C., Keeble served as a lieutenant in the United States Navy. He was assigned to the \\"Bureau of Ordnance\\" where he worked in the planning of rocket-producing plants, for which there existed no industrial precedent. The expertise developed during this led him many contracts for these facilities. ==Post-war career== ===Private homes=== The Dr. Cleo Miller House, listed on the National Register of Historic Places.After the war, in 1946, Keeble opened his solo practice, Edwin A. Keeble & Associates. He designed private residences and several are on the National Register of Historic Places. Examples are the Dr. Cleo Miller House at 1431 Shelton Avenue in Nashville, and the 4410 Truxton Place house in Belle Meade. The latter house was designed in the 1960s for Keeble's nephew, Sydney Keeble and is the \\"French Regency\\" style. According to the Nashville Post, the description, \\"It's a Keeble\\" is used as a symbol of added desirability in describing upscale Nashville homes. Keeble was quite busy during his prime years, with up to 100 projects per year. He designed seven houses, including his own, on Nashville's Stanford Drive, and the enclave was unofficially called \\"Keeble Heights\\". Here are selected examples of his private homes, all designed by Keeble unless otherwise noted; not intended to be complete: *5403 Stanford Drive, the Walter Stokes Jr. House, (1930), Colonial Revival Style, Forest Hills, Tennessee *30 Castlewood Court, the Richard E. Martin House (1931), Forest Hills, Tennessee (Warfield and Keeble), NRHP-listed *5134 Stanford Drive (1932) *The Guilford Dudley Jr house, \\"Northumberland\\", Hillsboro Pike at Harding Place, Colonial Revival style *John H. Dewitt Jr. home (now demolished), Stanford Drive, International Style *1431 Shelton Avenue (see photo), the Dr. Cleo Miller House, Tudor Revival style (1934–36), Nashville, Tennessee, NRHP-listed With . *5335 Stanford Drive, the Dr. Cobb Pilcher House, \\"Deepwood\\". This was one of the first Modernist homes in Nashville. (1936), Forest Hills, Tennessee (Warfield and Keeble), NRHP-listed *5401 Stanford Drive, the Dr. Frank Luton house, (1938), Country French *5405 Stanford Drive, the Edwin A. Keeble House. (1936) He designed his own house on Stanford Drive. *1301 Chickering Road, the William J. Tyne House (1936) demolished 2017. *1315 Chickering Road, Einer Nielsen house (1938), Forest Hills, Tennessee. Keeble added to it in 1978. *5617 Hillsboro Pike, the P.D. Houston Jr. House (1941), Forest Hills, Tennessee (Warfield and Keeble), NRHP- listed *4410 Truxton Place house, the Sydney Keeble house, French Regency style Belle Meade (1967) *5415 Stanford Drive (1970) *5400 Stanford Drive *5520 Stanford Drive *6129 Hillsboro Pike, The Snodgrass House, \\"Cedarwood\\" (1938) Colonial Revival style Vine St. Christian Church, Nashville ===Churches=== Keeble designed churches in Nashville and elsewhere. Some include: *Westminster Presbyterian Church, 3900 West End Ave, Nashville, (With Warfield), 1938; 150 foot steeple; cost, $137,000. Its significance was that it was the first classically-inspired Georgian church in Nashville (others were typically Romanesque or Gothic). *Woodmont Christian Church, 3601 Hillsboro Pike, Neo-Classical style with a 220-foot spire, 1949; cost, $350,0000. The tall narrow steeple has been referred to as one of \\"Keebles needles\\" says architectural writer Trish Elston . *Vine Street Christian Church (see photo) 4101 Harding Pike, Nashville, 1958; it features a 187-foot steeple and working shutters for the windows. During the construction, Keeble personally supervised the brickmasons to take five bricks from separate piles to minimize color variations; cost, $900,000. *Nashville First Baptist Church (see photo), 7th and Broadway, Nashville (1970); Keeble had to please two factions of the congregation; preservationists cherished the existing 1886 Victorian Gothic design; others wanted to rebuild an entirely new church. Keeble elected to keep the original tower, which was achievable since the tower stood on its own foundation and to build a new structure partially around it. An architecture critic said the addition \\"did nothing to complement the powerful steeple\\"; cost, about $2 million. The main design inspiration for First Baptist Church, Nashville came from the completed 1962 Coventry Cathedral in Coventry, England. Most notable similarities are the tall, vertical windows on the North and South sides of the Sanctuary that go back through the Nave and the Schantz Pipe Organ with its stacked tiers of organ pipes, modeled after the 1962 Harrison and Harrison organ which is housed in Coventry Cathedral. *Immanuel Baptist Church Belle Meade Boulevard, Nashville, Neo-Classical, 1954. It features an unusually tall steeple over a columned portico. *Donelson Presbyterian Church, 2305 Lebanon Road, Nashville, (1952); cost, $85,000. *First Christian Church, Glasgow, Kentucky *Warren Chapel, Monteagle, Tennessee *Bellevue Baptist Church, Memphis. ===Life and Casualty tower=== Life & Casualty Tower, Nashville, 2018 Keeble designed the Life & Casualty Tower, a skyscraper in downtown Nashville completed in 1957. Architecture critics called it \\"Nashville's first landmark\\" and said, \\"it was clearly the pivotal building on which the course of Nashville's architecture turned finally to modernism.\\" USA Today (with input from the American Institute of Architects) named it as one of \\"The 25 must-see buildings in Tennessee\\" in 2017. At the time it was built, it was the tallest commercial structure in the Southeast. Writing in The Tennessean, Keeble described his thinking in designing the 31 story tower and said, \\"...every line in the Life and Casualty tower has a reason\\". His mission, as he described it, was to build a 409-foot tower providing light and a view; that only required one fourth of the present property area; with enough office space to meet the company's need for 25 years. His use of four-foot aluminum \\"fins\\" running up the side of the building (see photo) was designed to afford views but protect offices from the direct sun. In his planning, he consulted a Vanderbilt astronomer to map the site's exposure to the sun's rays. Keeble's intent was to maximize available sunlight in the building in winter; in summer, direct sun did not enter after 9:30 a.m. or before 5:15 p.m. Now called \\"passive solar architecture\\", this resulted in significant energy savings for the Life and Casualty owners two decades before energy conservation in buildings became a national concern. He said the aesthetic appeal of the fins is as \\"entirely incidental as it is welcome\\". He wanted to use even more aluminum in the structure, but limestone was needed for weight against wind pressure, and was less expensive. The top 20 floors were designed to be free of internal columns, another first for a building of this height. This required more steel and therefore higher cost, but created an additional 4000 square feet and more flexibility of arrangement without columns in the way. The building cost about six million dollars. ===Other designs=== He designed buildings on the campus of his alma mater Vanderbilt University, like McTyeire Hall and Memorial Gymnasium. On the campus of Sewanee University, Keeble designed McCready Hall, Hamilton Hall, and Cravens Hall. He was also the architect behind the Franklin County Airport in Sewanee. Outside Tennessee, Keeble designed the Milliken Building in Bowling Green, Kentucky, completed in 1963; it is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Keeble designed the Veterans Administration hospitals in Nashville and Washington, D.C. In 1970 Keeble retired, transferring his firm and its management to his long-time associates: Arnold Nye, William Lincoln, Louis C. Daugherty, Henry C. Waechter, and John F. Caldwell Jr. The new firm was named \\"Architect-Engineer Associates, Inc.\\" Keeble remained a consultant. Works include: (Keeble unless otherwise noted): *Vanderbilt University Memorial Gymnasium *Woodmont Terrace Apartments (1938–39), 920 Woodmont, Nashville, Tennessee (with Warfield), NRHP-listed With . *Hillsboro High School (1954) *Nashville Airport Terminal, \\"Berry Field\\"(1944) *Franklin County Airport, Sewanee, Tennessee *Life & Casualty Tower (1957), Nashville *Milliken Building (1963), 1039 College St., Bowling Green, Kentucky, NRHP-listed *Veterans Administration hospital, Nashville *Peach Blossom Square, ten-home town house Development, Nashville *Vanderbilt University, McTyeire Hall (1940), (with Warfield) * U.S. Naval Reserve Training Center, Shelby Park, (1948). A pool was installed for \\"river assault boat training\\" and was used until 1961. *Veterans Administration hospital, Washington, D.C. *Numerous rocket and ammunitions plants around the U.S. for the Navy. ==Educational pursuits== Keeble briefly taught architecture at the University of Pennsylvania but when he moved to Nashville, he had a desire to raise the entire profile of architecture there. Early in his career, he felt that a prestigious school of architecture could be founded at Vanderbilt University; writing in a 1932 letter, he said \\"If we would realize our own strength and the possibilities of it, Southern architecture would follow Southern literature\\". Many young people who wished to study architecture came to him during the 1920s and 1930s. Rather than set them up in his office as apprentices, he did what his teacher Paul Cret had done and organized the \\"Nashville Architectural Studio\\". Working without pay, Keeble involved other architects in the teaching project including Edward E. Dougherty, Granbery Jackson Jr. and Henry C. Hibbs. Through Keeble's efforts, this group became associated with the Beaux-Arts Institute of Design in New York and was recognized as the Institute's \\"Nashville Atelier\\". This meant that its students were able to transfer credits to almost any school of architecture in the United States. They met from 1930 to 1932 in a room provided by Vanderbilt University. Vanderbilt would not commit to the project to establish a school of architecture— a decision which, says Architecture historian Christine Kreyling, \\"still inhibits the seriousness with which the design of the built environment is taken in the city\\". ==Personal life== Keeble married Barbara McKelvey from Youngstown, Ohio, a graduate of Smith College, in 1936. She was studying music at Ward-Belmont in Nashville. They had a daughter, Kezia and a son, Edwin A. Keeble Jr. The junior Keeble, a Marine, was killed in the Vietnam War when his helicopter was shot down by enemy ground fire February 28, 1969. He had attended Deerfield Academy and had graduated from Princeton a couple of years prior. The daughter, Kezia Keeble was one of Vogue Magazine's youngest editors at age 24 and a founder of A New York public relations and advertising firm, Keeble, Cavaco, and Duka. The New York Times called Keeble \\"a shaper of American Fashion\\". She died of breast cancer at age 48. Keeble married Alice Beasley on December 15, 1950 in LaGrange, Tennessee. They resided in a home he designed in the Classical Revival architectural style on Stanford Drive in Forest Hills, a suburb of Nashville. They had a son, Peter and a daughter, Lucy Keeble Wilkinson. Edwin Keeble died on September 22, 1979 in Sewanee, Tennessee at the age of 74. His funeral was held in the Warren Chapel (which Keeble designed) located at the Monteagle Sunday School Assembly in Monteagle, Tennessee, and he was buried in the Mount Olivet Cemetery in Nashville. Keeble's business associate in the 1930s, Francis B. Warfield died August 6, 1975 at age 84. == Notes == ==References== ==External links== * Category:1905 births Category:1979 deaths Category:People from Monteagle, Tennessee Category:People from Davidson County, Tennessee Category:Vanderbilt University alumni Category:American alumni of the École des Beaux-Arts Category:University of Pennsylvania School of Design alumni Category:Architects from Tennessee Category:20th-century American architects Category:Burials at Mount Olivet Cemetery (Nashville) ","title":"Edwin A.

Although the set of problems is not exhaustive, it may be used to simplify inverse kinematic analysis for many industrial robots. == Simplification strategies == For a structure equation defined by the product of exponentials method, Paden–Kahan subproblems may be used to simplify and solve the inverse kinematics problem. Notably, the matrix exponentials are non-commutative. Generally, subproblems are applied to solve for particular points in the inverse kinematics problem (e.g., the intersection of joint axes) in order to solve for joint angles. === Eliminating revolute joints === Simplification is accomplished by the principle that a rotation has no effect on a point lying on its axis. For example, if the point p is on the axis of a revolute twist \\\\xi, its position is unaffected by the actuation of the twist. To wit:e^{\\\\widehat{\\\\xi}\\\\theta}p=p Thus, for a structure equatione^{\\\\widehat{\\\\xi}_1\\\\theta_1}e^{\\\\widehat{\\\\xi}_2\\\\theta_2}e^{\\\\widehat{\\\\xi}_3\\\\theta_3}=gwhere \\\\xi_1, \\\\xi_2 and \\\\xi_3 are all zero-pitch twists, applying both sides of the equation to a point p which is on the axis of \\\\xi_3 (but not on the axes of \\\\xi_1 or \\\\xi_2) yieldse^{\\\\widehat{\\\\xi}_1\\\\theta_1}e^{\\\\widehat{\\\\xi}_2\\\\theta_2}e^{\\\\widehat{\\\\xi}_3\\\\theta_3}p=gpBy the cancellation of \\\\xi_3, this yieldse^{\\\\widehat{\\\\xi}_1\\\\theta_1}e^{\\\\widehat{\\\\xi}_2\\\\theta_2}p=gpwhich, if \\\\xi_1 and \\\\xi_2 intersect, may be solved by Subproblem 2. === Norm === In some cases, the problem may also be simplified by subtracting a point from both sides of the equation and taking the norm of the result. For example, to solvee^{\\\\widehat{\\\\xi}_1\\\\theta_1}e^{\\\\widehat{\\\\xi}_2\\\\theta_2}e^{\\\\widehat{\\\\xi}_3\\\\theta_3}=gfor \\\\xi_3, where \\\\xi_1 and \\\\xi_2 intersect at the point q, both sides of the equation may be applied to a point p that is not on the axis of \\\\xi_3. Subtracting q and taking the norm of both sides yields\\\\begin{aligned} \\\\delta_i = \\\\gp-q\\\\ = \\\\e^{\\\\widehat{\\\\xi}_1\\\\theta_1}e^{\\\\widehat{\\\\xi}_2\\\\theta_2}e^{\\\\widehat{\\\\xi}_3\\\\theta_3}p-q\\\\ = \\\\e^{\\\\widehat{\\\\xi}_1\\\\theta_1}e^{\\\\widehat{\\\\xi}_2\\\\theta_2}(e^{\\\\widehat{\\\\xi}_3\\\\theta_3}p-q)\\\\ = \\\\e^{\\\\widehat{\\\\xi}_3\\\\theta_3}p-q\\\\ \\\\end{aligned} This may be solved using Subproblem 3. == List of subproblems == Each subproblem is presented as an algorithm based on a geometric proof. Code to solve a given subproblem, which should be written to account for cases with multiple solutions or no solution, may be integrated into inverse kinematics algorithms for a wide range of robots. == Subproblem 1: Rotation about a single axis == :An illustration of the first Paden–Kahan subproblem.Let \\\\xi be a zero-pitch twist with unit magnitude and p, q \\\\in \\\\R^3 be two points. Find \\\\theta such that e^{\\\\widehat{\\\\xi}\\\\theta}p=q. In this subproblem, a point p is rotated around a given axis \\\\xi such that it coincides with a second point q.An illustration of the projected circle in the first Paden–Kahan subproblem. === Solution === Let r be a point on the axis of \\\\xi. Define the vectors u=(p-r) and v=(q-r). Since r is on the axis of \\\\xi, e^{\\\\widehat{\\\\xi}\\\\theta}r=r. Therefore, e^{\\\\widehat{\\\\omega}\\\\theta}u=v. Next, the vectors u' and v' are defined to be the projections of u and v onto the plane perpendicular to the axis of \\\\xi. For a vector \\\\omega \\\\in \\\\R in the direction of the axis of \\\\xi,u'=u-\\\\omega\\\\omega^Tuandv'=v-\\\\omega\\\\omega^Tv.In the event that u'=0, p=q and both points lie on the axis of rotation. The subproblem therefore yields an infinite number of possible solutions in that case. In order for the problem to have a solution, it is necessary that the projections of u and v onto the \\\\omega axis and onto the plane perpendicular to \\\\omega have equal lengths. It is necessary to check, to wit, that:\\\\omega^Tu=\\\\omega^Tvand that\\\\u'\\\\=\\\\v'\\\\ If these equations are satisfied, the value of the joint angle \\\\theta may be found using the atan2 function:\\\\theta=\\\\mathrm{atan2}(\\\\omega^T(u'\\\\times v'), u'^Tv').Provided that u' eq 0, this subproblem should yield one solution for \\\\theta. == Subproblem 2: Rotation about two subsequent axes == :Illustration of Paden–Kahan Subproblem 2. The subproblem yields two solutions in the event that the circles intersect at two points; one solution if the circles are tangential; and no solution if the circles fail to intersect.Let \\\\xi_1 and \\\\xi_2 be two zero-pitch twists with unit magnitude and intersecting axes. Let p, q \\\\in \\\\R^3 be two points. Find \\\\theta_1 and \\\\theta_2 such that e^{\\\\widehat{\\\\xi}_1\\\\theta_1}e^{\\\\widehat{\\\\xi}_2\\\\theta_2}p=q. This problem corresponds to rotating p around the axis of \\\\xi_2 by \\\\theta_2, then rotating it around the axis of \\\\xi_1 by \\\\theta_1, so that the final location of p is coincident with q. (If the axes of \\\\xi_1 and \\\\xi_2 are coincident, then this problem reduces to Subproblem 1, admitting all solutions such that \\\\theta_1+\\\\theta_2=\\\\theta.) === Solution === Provided that the two axes are not parallel (i.e., \\\\omega_1 eq \\\\omega_2), let c be a point such that e^{\\\\widehat{\\\\xi}_2\\\\theta_2} p=c=e^{-\\\\widehat{\\\\xi}_1\\\\theta_1}q. In other words, c represents the point to which p is rotated around one axis before it is rotated around the other axis to be coincident with q. Each individual rotation is equivalent to Subproblem 1, but it’s necessary to identify one or more valid solutions for c in order to solve for the rotations. Let r be the point of intersection of the two axes:e^{\\\\widehat{\\\\xi}_2\\\\theta_2}(p-r)=c-r=e^{-\\\\widehat{\\\\xi}_1\\\\theta_1}(q-r).An illustration of Paden–Kahan subproblem 2, showing the tangential case in which the subproblem yields only one solution.Define the vectors u=(p-r), v=(q-r) and z=(c-r). Therefore,e^{\\\\widehat{\\\\xi}_2\\\\theta_2}u=z=e^{-\\\\widehat{\\\\xi}_1\\\\theta_1}v. This implies that \\\\omega^T_2u=\\\\omega^T_2z, \\\\omega^T_1 v=\\\\omega^T_1z, and \\\\u\\\\^2=\\\\z\\\\^2=\\\\v\\\\^2. Since \\\\omega_1, \\\\omega_2 and \\\\omega_1 \\\\times \\\\omega_2 are linearly independent, z can be written asz=\\\\alpha \\\\omega_1 + \\\\beta\\\\omega_2 + \\\\gamma(\\\\omega_1 \\\\times \\\\omega_2). The values of the coefficients may be solved thus:An illustration of Paden–Kahan subproblem 2, showing a case with two intersecting circles and therefore two solutions. Both solutions (c, c2) are highlighted.\\\\alpha = \\\\frac{(\\\\omega^T_1 \\\\omega_2)\\\\omega^T_2u-\\\\omega^T_1v}{(\\\\omega^T_1\\\\omega_2)^2 - 1}\\\\beta = \\\\frac{(\\\\omega^T_1 \\\\omega_2)\\\\omega^T_1v-\\\\omega^T_2u}{(\\\\omega^T_1\\\\omega_2)^2 - 1}, and\\\\gamma^2=\\\\frac{\\\\u\\\\^2-\\\\alpha^2-\\\\beta^2-2\\\\alpha\\\\beta\\\\omega^T_1 \\\\omega_2}{\\\\\\\\omega_1 \\\\times \\\\omega_2\\\\^2.}The subproblem yields two solutions in the event that the circles intersect at two points; one solution if the circles are tangential; and no solution if the circles fail to intersect. == Subproblem 3: Rotation to a given distance == :Let \\\\xi be a zero-pitch twist with unit magnitude; let p, q \\\\in \\\\R^3 be two points; and let \\\\delta be a real number greater than 0. Find \\\\theta such that \\\\q-e^{\\\\widehat{\\\\xi} \\\\theta}p\\\\ = \\\\delta. In this problem, a point p is rotated about an axis \\\\xi until the point is a distance \\\\delta from a point q. In order for a solution to exist, the circle defined by rotating p around \\\\xi must intersect a sphere of radius \\\\delta centered at q. === Solution === Let r be a point on the axis of \\\\xi. The vectors u=(p-r) and v=(q-r) are defined so that\\\\v-e^{\\\\widehat{\\\\xi}\\\\theta}u\\\\^2=\\\\delta^2. The projections of u and v are u'=u-\\\\omega\\\\omega^Tu and v'=v-\\\\omega\\\\omega^Tv. The “projection” of the line segment defined by \\\\delta is found by subtracting the component of p-q in the \\\\omega direction:\\\\delta'^2 = \\\\delta^2 - \\\\omega^T(p-q)^2.The angle \\\\theta_0 between the vectors u' and v' is found using the atan2 function:\\\\theta_0 = atan2(\\\\omega^T(u'\\\\times v'), u'^Tv').The joint angle \\\\theta is found by the formula\\\\theta=\\\\theta_0 \\\\pm \\\\cos^{-1} \\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\u'\\\\^2 + \\\\v'\\\\^2 - \\\\delta'^2}{2\\\\u'\\\\ \\\\v'\\\\} \\\\right).This subproblem may yield zero, one, or two solutions, depending on the number of points at which the circle of radius \\\\u'\\\\ intersects the circle of radius \\\\delta'. == Subproblem 4: Rotation about two axes to a given distance == :Let \\\\xi_1 and \\\\xi_2 be two zero-pitch twists with unit magnitude and intersecting axes. Let p, q_1, q_2 \\\\in \\\\R^3 be points. Find \\\\theta_1 and \\\\theta_2 such that \\\\e^{\\\\widehat{\\\\xi}_1\\\\theta_1}e^{\\\\widehat{\\\\xi}_2\\\\theta_2}p-q_1\\\\=\\\\delta_1. This problem is analogous to Subproblem 2, except that the final point is constrained by distances to two known points. == Subproblem 5: Translation to a given distance == :Let \\\\xi be an infinite-pitch unit magnitude twist; p, q \\\\in \\\\R^3 two points; and \\\\delta a real number greater than 0. Find \\\\theta such that \\\\q-e^{\\\\widehat{\\\\xi}\\\\theta}p\\\\=\\\\delta. ==References== Category:Computational geometry Category:Robotic manipulation ","title":"Paden–Kahan subproblems"},{"id":"56625789","text":"These are the list of personnel changes in the NBA from the 1962–63 NBA season. ==Events== ===July 13, 1962=== * The Cincinnati Royals traded Larry Staverman to the Chicago Zephyrs for Dave Piontek.

She was a daughter of Pierre Lorillard III of the Lorillard Tobacco Company. == Early life== Mary Lorillard was born on April 17, 1841. She was the daughter of Pierre Lorillard III (1796–1867) and Catherine Anne (née Griswold) Lorillard (1809–1856). Her siblings included Pierre Lorillard IV; Catherine Lorillard, who married James Powell Kernochan; Jacob Lorillard; George Lyndes Lorillard, who married Marie Louise La Farge, the daughter of John La Farge and the sister of Christopher Grant La Farge, who later became the Countess de Agreda after she married Count de Agreda; Louis Lasher Lorillard, who married Katherine Livingston Beeckman, sister of Governor Robert Livingston Beeckman; and Eva Lorillard, who married Lawrence Kip. Her paternal grandparents were Pierre Lorillard II, a prominent tobacco manufacturer and real estate tycoon for whom the term \\"millionaire\\" was first used, and Maria Dorothea (née Schultz) Lorillard. His mother's family owned \\"the great New York mercantile house of N. L. & G. Griswold, known to their rivals as \\"No Loss and Great Gain Griswold,\\" importers of rum, sugar, and tea.\\" ==Society life== Mrs. Barbey and her daughter Eva were included in the infamous \\"Four Hundred\\" of New York Society, as dictated by Mrs. Astor and Ward McAllister and published in The New York Times on February 16, 1892. The number 400 was reportedly the number of people who would fit into Mrs. Astor's ballroom. Barbey and her husband were members of the Tuxedo Club and built one of the earliest residences in Tuxedo Park, New York, which was founded by her family. She was also a member of the Colonial Dames of America. In summer, the Barbeys were residents of Bellevue on Lake Geneva in Switzerland, where her husband was born in 1832. Her husband was a founding member, and a member of the vestry for 31 years, of Emmanuel Episcopal Church, also known as \\"The American Church,\\" in Geneva. He donated the land for the construction of the church building, and partially financed its construction and running during the early years. ==Personal life== Portrait of Mary's husband Henry, by Wilhelm Heinrich Funk, 1903 On January 12, 1865, she was married to Henry Isaac Barbey (1832–1906).

The Rhodians also controlled territory on neighbouring Caria that was known as Rhodian Peraia under the islanders' rule. However, many other eastern Mediterranean states and polities adopted Rhodian (Chian) monetary standard following Rhodes. It has been speculated how much Rhodians had influenced the spread of the monetary standard. Coinage using the standard achieved a wide circulation in the region. Even the Ptolemaic Kingdom, a major Hellenistic state in the eastern Mediterranean, briefly adopted the Rhodian monetary standard. ==Rhodian monetary standard== Colossus of Rhodes, artist's impression, 1880 Rule by Athens temporarily brought Attic standard to Rhodian mints. However, after Athenian league's influence waned, Chian standard spread through the Eastern Mediterranean. It is unknown how much Rhodes made an impact on the spread of the Chian standard. Rhodes held a growing economical importance during that period which came after its unification. This weight standard was subsequently known as a Rhodian standard, thus giving a further hint on the leading role of Rhodes. By the end of the fourth century BC the Aegean region had been dominated by coinage using Attic and Rhodian standards. Early Rhodian standard had replaced Aeginetan standard in silver coinage for most Cycladian mints by the third century BC. By Alexander the Great's time Rhodian standard was accepted by most of Ionia, Caria and by numerous states of the Cyclades and Propontis. Alexander's adoption of the Attic weight brought demise of all other weight standards except for the Attic and Rhodian standards. Rhodian standard was later notably used in the transition to Phoenician weight by the Ptolemaic Kingdom as it abandoned the Attic weight in favor of its own monetary standard. Ptolemaic use of the Rhodian standard was restricted to an approximate period of c. 310 BC – c. 298 BC. Early Chian, or Rhodian, standard included tetradrachms and heavier coins. However, later coinage using Rhodian weight evolved with tetradrachms being abandoned in favor of smaller didrachms. Coins lost their weight both before and after the abandonment of the tetradrachms. Early tetradrachms and didrachms were 15.6 g and 7.8 g in weight respectively. They were both replaced in use by later didrachms with the minimum weight of 6.7 g. There is convincing evidence that Rhodian and Lycian league's plinthophoroi circulated, at least informally, at par on the market, and they have been found together in coin hoards. However, Lycian coinage's weight standard was slightly lighter than Rhodian standard. ==Mints== Rhodes itself held the most important mints. Ephesus is notable for holding the most important mint for the Rhodian monetary standard outside of the Rhodian controlled territory. Naxos minted tetrobols (Rhodian weight drachms) while using Aeginetan standard for other coins. Ios was another island that saw limited usage of the Rhodian standard. It was primarily known for hosting the tomb of Homer. A very small series of didrachms were struck between 350 BC – 320 BC, and they included a portrait and name of Homer on observe sides of the coins. ==History of Rhodian coinage== Territory controlled by Rhodes. Rhodian territory is in green (lighter green is territory after the Treaty of Apamea in 188 BC). Rhodes was a major maritime and mercantile power. For instance, Syrian goods on bound to Egypt made a detour through the island of Rhodes. Rhodians also made large contributions to fight piracy in the region. Rhodes was an ally of the Ptolemaic Kingdom. Siege of Rhodes (305 BC – 304 BC) by Demetrius I of Macedon resulted in Rhodians gaining wider freedom of action, and ties with Ptolemaic Egypt being strengthened. The siege had been an attempt to break the Rhodo-Egyptian alliance. However, tetradrachms and golden coinage originating from Rhodes disappeared for a considerable length of time. Rhodian didrachms (weighting 6,7g) gained a solid position, with its wide circulation, in the eastern Mediterranean trade. Its atypical weight did not allow the Rhodian didrachm to function as a real international means of exchange. Many Rhodian silver coins were also melted down in Egypt when spent there, and were subsequently struck as Ptolemaic coinage. During 88 BC siege of Rhodes by Mithridates VI a possible emergency series of large bronze coinage was struck as a result of the war. ===End of the local currency=== The final demise for the Rhodian currency was brought by the late Republican Roman civil wars beginning from the Caesar's Civil War. Many small Hellenistic silver currencies ceased to exist. By 30 BC the Roman monetary system and denarii were clearly dominant in the eastern parts of the Empire. Rhodes came under direct Roman rule in 31 AD and was merged in the province of Asia in 44 AD. ===Themes=== Fig 1. Rhodian tetradrachm portraying the sun god Helios (obverse) and a rose (reverse). Sun god Helios was the prominent deity for the Rhodians. Several ancient towns claimed descent from the deity. Helios would appear on obverse sides of Rhodian coinage for four centuries. Designs of Rhodian coinage were unaffected by the campaigns of Alexander the Great. Rhodes used a head of Helios or a rose as their symbol. These symbols were also used in other forms of art, in addition to coinage, such as in stamps of amphorae. Local symbols can be used to determine the origin of an artifact, and in certain cases the symbol refers to the name of the place. The rose refers to Rhodes as a canting symbol (making a pun of the name). One type of Rhodian tetradrachms (see fig. 1) used a ship's prow as a symbol of Rhodian naval might. The prow is more evident from a more complete specimen of the coin, and it is on the left side of the rose which is on reverse side of the coin. On the right side of the rose is a bud. Below the rose is name of the magistrate, and a text above the rose refers to Rhodes. Obverse side of the coin portrays sun god Helios.

Key findings of his research include the following: * Children in the U.S. on the margin of being placed in foster care (e.g. in cases where the recommendations of child protection investigators disagree) are on average better off if they remain at home, especially for older children. * Juvenile incarceration in the U.S. decreases the likelihood of incarcerated individuals completing high school and increases the likelihood of adult (re-)incarceration. * Children in the U.S. on the margin of placement in foster care are two to three times more likely to enter the criminal justice system as adults if they were placed in foster care, a situation that is disproportionately common for African Americans, girls and young adolescents. In particular, Doyle's research with Douglas Almond, Heidi Williams and Amanda E. Kowalski on the marginal returns of medical care for at-risk newborns was awarded the Garfield Economic Impact Award by Research!America in 2011.Research!America (December 8th, 2011). Authors of Landmark Study on Economic Benefits of Advanced Medical Care for At-Risk Newborns Receive Garfield Economic Impact Award. Retrieved on February 19th, 2018. The study showed that medical care prescribed as a result of newborns being slightly below the critical birthweight threshold of 1,500 grams was effective in substantially decreasing the mortality of these newborns relative to newborns slightly above the threshold. The authors then use the cost of the decrease in mortality rates for these newborns to estimate the cost for saving a newborn's statistical life to be about $550,000 in 2006 US$, i.e. well below common estimates of the value of a full statistical life. == References == == External links == * Webpage of Joseph Doyle at MIT Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Living people Category:Health economists Category:American economists Category:MIT Sloan School of Management faculty Category:Cornell University alumni Category:University of Chicago alumni ","title":"Joseph Doyle (economist)"},{"id":"56625985","text":"These are the list of personnel changes in the NBA from the 1970–71 NBA season. ==Events== ===July 8, 1970=== * The Phoenix Suns traded Heywood Dotson to the New York Knicks for a 1971 5th round draft pick (Bob Kissane was later selected). ===July 27, 1970=== * The Phoenix Suns waived Neil Johnson. ===August 28, 1970=== * The Los Angeles Lakers claimed Fred Hetzel on waivers from the Portland Trail Blazers. ===September 10, 1970=== * The San Diego Rockets traded Art Williams to the Boston Celtics for a 1971 5th round draft pick (Greg Nelson was later selected). ===September 15, 1970=== * The Chicago Bulls signed A.W.

The base is about 5 km southeast of Agadez. It is owned by the Nigerien military but built and paid for by the United States. It is operated by the U.S. military as a drone base. As of February 2018, the site consists of a runway, still under construction, a hangar, and numerous smaller buildings for personnel to work and live in. ==Operations== The U.S. military presence at Base 201 began on April 19, 2016. Once complete, the runway will be big enough to accommodate both General Atomics MQ-9 Reaper armed drones as well as the much larger Boeing C-17 Globemaster III transport airplanes. Construction was scheduled to be completed by the end of 2018. However, delays have pushed the completion estimate to mid-2019. Runway construction is being undertaken by the 31st Expeditionary Rapid Engineer Deployable Heavy Operational Repair Squadron Engineers. In May 2019 Vice News reported on activity at the base, then non- operational, amidst a wider report on the consequences of a US withdrawal from Niger.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xf3ZhovZ2So In July 2019, the 409th Air Expeditionary Group and the 411th Civil Affairs Battalion are stationed at the base. ISR flights officially began on November 1, 2019. ==Construction== The amount of US$50 million was approved by Congress for the base, but the cost may end up exceeding $100 million. The base was originally planned to be operational by the end of 2018, but delays have caused the completion date of the base to be pushed to mid-2019. The Air Base was described by U.S. officials as the largest construction project led by the United States Air Force. A report by the Department of Defense Inspector General criticized the project for skirting congressional oversight, failing to complete an adequate site survey, and not constructing the base to meet safety, security, and other technical requirements, findings that were disputed by the Air Force and U.S. Africa Command. ==See also== ==References== == External links == * Online BBC press article: War in the desert - Why the Sahara is terror's new front line.

The painting depicts a moment from the Greek and Roman legend of the tragic youth Hylas, based on accounts by Ovid and other ancient writers, in which the enraptured Hylas is abducted by Naiads (female water nymphs) while seeking drinking water. Hylas and the Nymphs is exhibited in the Manchester Art Gallery.Hylas and the Nymphs, Manchester Art Gallery == Background == === Myth === Hylas was the son of King Theiodamas of the Dryopians. After Hercules killed Hylas's father, Hylas became a companion of Hercules and later his lover. They both became Argonauts, accompanying Jason in his quest on his ship Argo in seeking the Golden Fleece. During the journey, Hylas was sent to find fresh water. He found a pond occupied by Naiads, and they lured Hylas into the water and he disappeared. === The painting === The painting measures . It depicts Hylas, a male youth in classical garb, wearing a blue tunic with a red sash, and bearing a wide- necked water jar. He is bending down beside a pond in a glade of lush green foliage, reaching out towards seven young women, the water nymphs, who are emerging from the pond among the leaves and flowers of Nymphaeaceae (water lilies), including an early depiction of the yellow waterlily, Nuphar lutea. The nymphs are naked, their alabaster skin luminous in the dark but clear water, with yellow and white flowers in their auburn hair. They have very similar physical features, perhaps based on just two models. Hylas is being enticed to enter the water, from which he will not return. One of the nymphs holds his wrist and elbow, a second plucks at his tunic, and a third holds out some pearls in the palm of her hand. The face of Hylas in profile is shadowed and barely visible, but the faces of the nymphs are clearly visible as they gaze upon him. The scene is depicted from a slightly elevated position, looking down at the water like Hylas, so no sky is visible. Hylas's position forces the viewer's focus onto the nymphs in the water and the lack of reference to his relationship with Hercules emphasizes that the narrative of the painting is not about the Hylas narrative, but about the sinister nature of the nymphs. Some of Waterhouse's preparatory sketches are in the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford. == Significance == Hylas was a recurrent theme for British artists in the 19th and early 20th centuries, with examples by William Etty (1833) and Henrietta Rae (1910), and an earlier example by Waterhouse himself (1893). Waterhouse also painted other tragic youths from Greek legend, such as Narcissus in Echo and Narcissus (1903) (at the Walker Art Gallery in Liverpool). His poem \\"Hercules and Hylas\\" was published by Francis Burdett Thomas Coutts-Nevill in 1896.

It was exhibited at the Royal Academy Summer Exhibition in 1897. In January 2018, Manchester Art Gallery curator Clare Gannaway temporarily removed the painting from public display, after a decision \\"taken by gallery staff [along] with artist Sonia Boyce.\\" The decision, the curator stated, was \\"influenced by recent movements against the objectification and exploitation of women\\" such as the MeToo campaign and the Presidents Club controversy. She denied the removal constituted any form of censorship, stating, \\"we want to see this as the start of a process, not an end point,\\" and providing visitors with Post-It notes to air their views; meantime, postcards of the painting were removed from the gift shop. A \\"strong backlash\\" followed the decision. Art historian and author Elizabeth Prettejohn, who had previously curated a Waterhouse exhibition at the Royal Academy, disputed the claims about \\"public debate\\", stating that \\"taking [the painting] off display is killing any kind of debate that you might be able to have.\\" After one week, the Manchester City Council, which runs the gallery, decided the painting should return to the wall. \\"It's been clear that many people feel very strongly about the issues raised,\\" stated the council in the announcement. ==Notes== ==References== * * Category:Paintings by John William Waterhouse Category:Collection of Manchester Art Gallery Category:1896 paintings Category:Bathing in art Category:Nymphs ","title":"Hylas and the Nymphs (painting)"},{"id":"56626181","text":"Alysia Rissling (born November 16, 1988) is a Canadian bobsledder.

Thorndike, an educational psychologist who taught at Teachers College, Columbia University. Frances was educated at Horace Mann School in New York and at Drum Hill High School in Peekskill. She graduated from Vassar College in 1922 and earned her master's degree in mathematics from Columbia University in 1925. In a 1926 paper, she first published a two-dimensional diagram of the Poisson distribution that is now named the Thorndike nomogram after her. She worked for several years as an engineering assistant at American Telephone and Telegraph Company (1922–24, 1925–27) before becoming an instructor of physics at Vassar (1927–28). She spent the 1928–29 academic year as a fellow working towards a Ph.D. at Radcliffe College, where she met fellow mathematician Thomas Freeman Cope; they married in 1929. In 1930, Cope and her husband moved to Ohio (where he had a job at Marietta College), and two years later she completed her doctorate at Radcliffe as a student of George David Birkhoff. The subject of her Ph.D. thesis was formal solutions of irregular differential equations, and the publications that came out of it continue to be cited in the literature of both mathematics and physics. Cope taught mathematics as an instructor at Vassar in 1935–36.

A particularly vulnerable public housing area () is a district in Denmark with social problems, and which usually has a majority population of non-Western ethnicities. (Retrieved 3 July 2019) Such areas are often referred to in Danish as \\"ghettos\\", and an annual \\"ghetto list\\" (ghettolisten) has been published by the Danish Ministry of Transport, Building and Housing since 2010. == Until May 2018 == At least three of the following five criteria had to be fulfilled for a district to be included on the list: * The share of inhabitants aged 18–64 neither in employment nor education is higher than 40%, as an average over the span of 2 years. * The share of immigrants and their descendants from non-Western countries is higher than 50%. * The share of inhabitants aged 18 and over convicted for infractions against the penal law, weapons law or drug regulations is greater than 2.7%, as an average over the span of 2 years. * The share of inhabitants of aged 30–59 with only primary education or less, is greater than 50%. * The average gross income for inhabitants aged 18–64 excluding those in education is less than 55% of the average gross income for the region in question. In 2017, no area fulfilled all five criteria, but four districts fulfilled four criteria: Mjølnerparken in Copenhagen, Gadehavegård in Høje-Taastrup, Vollsmose in Odense and Gellerupparken/Toveshøj in Aarhus. Prior to the May 2018 revision of the criteria, 22 districts were on the list. == May 2018 criteria == In May 2018 the criteria were revised and districts with three out of the five criteria were placed on the list. That changed the number of ghetto districts from 22 to 30. * Many inhabitants lack employment or education. Only educations approved in Denmark count. * There are many inhabitants who have only primary education (Folkeskole) * Many inhabitants have low income. * There are three times as many people with criminal convictions compared to the average for the country. * More than half the inhabitants are from non-Western countries or are descendants of migrants non- Western countries. Housing in Vollsmose, Odense - a 'severe ghetto'. === Severe ghettos === A district that remains four years in a row on the list is then classified to be a severe ghetto (Danish: hård ghetto). In May 2018 there were 16 severe ghettoes. Individuals receiving social welfare such as social benefits, education aid or integration aid are not allowed to settle in severe ghettoes. == Government response == In March 2018, the government of Denmark presented an action plan with 22 proposals where the Denmark would be rid of the ghettoes by 2030. Among the suggestions were funds of 12 billion DKK to have some districts demolished and others redeveloped. Regulations would change to facilitate evictions of criminals from their housing in the ghettoes. The plan was accepted by the Danish parliament in May 2018. On the same occasion, the criteria for list inclusion were changed. Before children in ghettoes start school, they will undergo a Danish language test and be offered language training before the school starts. === Public housing === The share of public housing in ghetto areas would be reduced to a maximum of 40% in districts that had been on the ghetto list for 4 consecutive years. Consequently, 9 buildings with 600 apartments in the Gellerup district and 3 buildings with 318 in the Bispehaven district of Aarhus are to be demolished, displacing 1,000 families. In their stead, 2000 homes for ownership and 657 business properties are planned to be built. All meetings of housing associations are to be held in Danish, even if some housing association board members do not speak the language. === Moving restrictions === Convicted criminals and people on public welfare would face restrictions on moving to areas on the list. === Name change === In June 2019 a new social democratic government was formed in Denmark, with Kaare Dybvad becoming housing minister. Dybvad said that official use of the word \\"ghetto\\" in reference to marginalized areas is \\"derogatory\\", and he wanted to put an end to political use of the word in order to avoid stigmatizing the areas.Thelocal.dk.

He is best known for his discovery of the precession of the equinoxes, independently of the earlier ancient Greek astronomer Hipparchus. He also postulated that the Earth could be spherical in shape instead of being flat and square, long before the idea became widely accepted in Chinese science thanks to the European influence of the Jesuits in the 17th century. ==Background and official career== The life and works of Yu Xi are described in his biography found in the Book of Jin, the official history of the Jin dynasty.Knechtges and Chang (2014), p. 2010. He was born in Yuyao, Guiji (modern Shaoxing, Zhejiang province, China). His father Yu Cha (虞察) was a military commander and his younger brother Yu Yu (虞預; fl. 307–329 AD) was likewise a scholar and writer. During the reign of Emperor Min of Jin (r. 313-317 AD) he obtained a low-level position in the administration of the governor of Guiji commandery.Knechtges and Chang (2014), p. 2009. He declined a series of nominations and promotions thereafter, including a teaching position at the imperial university in 325 AD, an appointment at the imperial court in 333 AD, and the post of cavalier attendant-in-ordinary in 335 AD. ==Works== In 336 AD Yu Xi wrote the An Tian Lun (安天論; Discussion of Whether the Heavens Are At Rest or Disquisition on the Conformation of the Heavens).The first English rendering is given by Needham and Ling (1995), p. 220, whereas the second translated title is provided by Knechtges and Chang (2014), p. 2010. In it he described the precession of the equinoxes (i.e. axial precession).Needham and Ling (1995), p. 220. He observed that the position of the sun during the winter solstice had drifted roughly one degree over the course of fifty years relative to the position of the stars.Sun (2017), p. 120. This was the same discovery made earlier by the ancient Greek astronomer Hipparchus (c. 190-120 BC), who found that the measurements for either the sun's path around the ecliptic to the vernal equinox or the sun's relative position to the stars were not equal in length. Yu Xi wrote a critical analysis of the huntian (渾天) theory of the celestial sphere, arguing that the heavens surrounding the earth were infinite and motionless. He advanced the idea that the shape of the earth was either square or round, but that it had to correspond to the shape of the heavens enveloping it. The huntian theory, as mentioned by Western Han dynasty astronomer Luoxia Hong (fl. 140-104 BC) and fully described by the Eastern Han dynasty polymath scientist and statesman Zhang Heng (78-139 AD), insisted that the heavens were spherical and that the earth was like an egg yolk at its center.Needham and Ling (1995), pp. 216-217. Yu Xi's ideas about the infinity of outer space seem to echo Zhang's ideas of endless space even beyond the celestial sphere. Although mainstream Chinese science before European influence in the 17th century surmised that the Earth was flat and square-shaped, some scholars, such as Song dynasty mathematician Li Ye (1192-1279 AD), proposed the idea that it was spherical like the heavens.Needham and Ling (1995), pp. 498-499. The acceptance of a spherical earth can be seen in the astronomical and geographical treatise Gezhicao (格致草) written in 1648 by Xiong Mingyu (熊明遇).Needham and Ling (1995), p. 499. It rejects the square-earth theory and, with clear European influence, explains that ships are capable of circumnavigating the globe. However, it explained this using classical Chinese phrases, such as the earth being as round as a crossbow bullet, a phrase Zhang Heng had previously used to describe the shape of both the sun and moon.Needham and Ling (1995), pp. 227, 499. Ultimately, though, it was the European Jesuits in China of the 17th century that dispelled the Chinese theory of a flat earth, convincing the Chinese to adopt the spherical earth theory established by the ancient Greeks Anaxagoras (c. 500-428 BC), Philolaus (c. 470-385), Aristotle (384-322 BC), and Eratosthenes (c. 276-195 BC).Cullen (1993), pp. 269-270; see also Song and Chen (1996), p. 308. Yu Xi is known to have written commentaries on the various Chinese classics. His commentaries and notes were mostly lost before the Tang dynasty, but the fragments preserved in other texts were collected in a single compendium by Qing-dynasty scholar Ma Guohan (1794-1857). ==See also== * History of science and technology in China * Kunyu Wanguo Quantu, Chinese world map published in 1602 by the Jesuit Matteo Ricci and Ming-Chinese colleagues, based on European discoveries * Shanhai Yudi Quantu, Chinese world map published in 1609 ==Citations== ==References== * Cullen, Christopher.

The name was originally used by an organisation which existed from 1815—1843. After that time the Grand Lodge of Greece took its place. The present organisation under the name of the Serene Grand Lodge of Greece was refounded in 1986 by former members of the Grand Lodge. Today, they are firmly associated with Liberal Freemasonry, belonging to ISMAP and now CLIPSAS. ==History== ===Serene Grand Lodge of Greece, 1815—1843=== Freemasonry in Greece originated at the end of the 18th century on the Ionian Islands. At the time they were ruled by Venice and at Corfu in 1782 the Loggia Beneficenza was founded practicing the Rectified Scottish Rite, under the jurisdiction of Verona. Freemasonry was suppressed in 1785 in Venice and the Lodge closed. After Napoleon Bonaparte conquered the Venetian Empire, the lodge was revived in 1797 in Corcyre, until 1800 when the Russian Empire established the Septinsular Republic and suppressed Freemasonry. After the Treaty of Tilsit, the islands fell un der the First French Empire and thus Freemasonry was revived again. Two lodges in Corfu were merged as Beneficenza-Filogenia Riunite. The leader of this lodge, Count Dionisios Romas, was keen to establish recognition. First, in 21 November 1811, he applied to the Grand Orient de France to make it a Provincial Mother Lodge. This was accepted and new lodges sprung up. A new political reality emerged in 1815, when the United States of the Ionian Islands was established under the protection of the British Empire. At this time, Romas renamed the lodge the Serene Grand Lodge of Greece and eventually lodges were formed at Zante, Cephalonia, Lefkas and Patras. Roma decided to ask his friend, Augustus, Duke of Sussex, who was then the Grand Master of the United Grand Lodge of England, if he would become the Grand Master. Politically, Romas was hoping to get the British onside for the liberation of Greece from the Ottoman Empire (on the eve of the Greek War of Independence). A significant number of Greeks who played a leading role in the War of Independence had earlier been involved in the Grand Orient. Involved were not just Greek nationalist revolutionaries and people influence by the Age of the Enlightenment, but also high ranking clerics of the Eastern Orthodox Church. This includes Emmanuil Xanthos (founder of the Filiki Etaireia), Germanos III of Old Patras, Gregory V of Constantinople, Theodoros Kolokotronis, Alexandros Mavrokordatos, Alexandros Ypsilantis, Alexandros Mourouzis, Ioannis Kapodistrias and others. ==References== * Freemasonry in Greece at Phoenix Masonry * A Concise History of the Grand Lodge of Greece by Ioannis A.

Deciphering mutational signatures in cancer provides insight into the biological mechanisms involved in carcinogenesis and normal somatic mutagenesis. Mutational signatures have shown their applicability in cancer treatment and cancer prevention. Advances in the fields of oncogenomics have enabled the development and use of molecularly targeted therapy, but such therapies historically focused on inhibition of oncogenic drivers (e.g. EGFR gain-of-function mutation and EGFR inhibitor treatment in colorectal cancer ). More recently, mutational signatures profiling has proven successful in guiding oncological management and use of targeted therapies (e.g. immunotherapy in mismatch repair deficient of diverse cancer types, platinum and PARP inhibitor to exploit synthetic lethality in homologous recombination deficient breast cancer). ==General concepts== Conceptual workflow of somatic mutational signatures identification. Diverse mutagenesis processes shape the somatic landscape of tumors. Deciphering the underlying patterns of cancer mutations allows to uncover relationships between these recurrent patterns of mutations and infer possible causal mutational processes. ===Mechanisms – overview=== :* DNA replication infidelity :** DNA proofreading is the process by which DNA polymerase excises an incorrectly incorporated nucleotide via exonuclease enzymatic reaction. Inability of DNA polymerase to correct these replication errors leads to progressive accumulation of mutations through successive cell mitosis. :* Genotoxins :** Endogenous cellular (e.g. spontaneous 5-methylcytosine deamination leads to C>T transition (genetics)) mutations (see DNA damage (naturally occurring)) :** Exogenous/carcinogens :*** Ultraviolet radiation: UVB radiation causes direct DNA damage and is a known risk factor for skin cancer (e.g. melanoma) :*** Alkylating antineoplastic agents: This group of chemotherapy agents adds alkyl group to DNA, which causes crosslinking of DNA and interferes with DNA replication and DNA repair. Cancer cells are most impacted because of their high mitosis rate. :*** Tobacco: Tobacco contains several carcinogens which are harmful to DNA, including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, acrolein, nitrosamines, cyanide and others (see health effects of tobacco) :* DNA repair deficiency :** Homologous recombination deficiency (HRD): DNA double-strand break requires homologous recombination mechanism for accurate repair of breakpoints. :** DNA mismatch repair (MMR) deficiency: The mismatch repair machinery recognizes and repairs erroneous base pair insertion, deletion or mis-incorporation. :* Enzymatic DNA editing :** Cytidine deaminase enzymes: This family of enzymes are part of the innate immune system and are involved in the control of retroviruses and transposons elements (including endogenous retroviruses). These enzymes (cytidine deaminase/CDA, activation-induced cytidine deaminase and APOBEC protein family) actively cause cytidine deamination and therefore introduce C>T transition (genetics) mutations. ===Genomic data=== Cancer mutational signatures analyses require genomic data from cancer genome sequencing with paired-normal DNA sequencing in order to create the tumor mutation catalog (mutation types and counts) of a specific tumor. Different types of mutations (e.g. single nucleotide variants, indels, structural variants) can be used individually or in combination to model mutational signatures in cancer. ====Types of mutations: base substitutions==== There are six classes of base substitution: C>A, C>G, C>T, T>A, T>C, T>G. The G>T substitution is considered equivalent to the C>A substitution because it is not possible to differentiate on which DNA strand (forward or reverse) the substitution initially occurred. Both the C>A and G>T substitutions are therefore counted as part of the \\"C>A\\" class. For the same reason the G>C, G>A, A>T, A>G and A>C mutations are counted as part of the \\"C>G\\", \\"C>T\\", \\"T>A\\", \\"T>C\\" and \\"T>G\\" classes respectively. Taking the information from the 5' and 3' adjacent bases (also called flanking base pairs or trinucleotide context) lead to 96 possible mutation types (e.g. A[C>A]A, A[C>A]T, etc.). The mutation catalog of a tumor is created by categorizing each single nucleotide variant (SNV) (synonyms: base-pair substitution or substitution point mutation) in one of the 96 mutation types and counting the total number of substitutions for each of these 96 mutation types (see figure). ====Tumor mutation catalog==== The 96 mutation types concept from Alexandrov et al. Considering the 5' flanking base (A, C, G, T), the 6 substitution classes (C>A, C>G, C>T, T>A, T>C, T>G) and 3' flanking base (A, C, G, T) leads to a 96 mutation types classification (4 x 6 x 4 = 96). The 16 possible mutation types of the substitution class C>A are shown as an example. Once the mutation catalog (e.g. counts for each of the 96 mutation types) of a tumor is obtained, there are two approaches to decipher the contributions of different mutational signatures to tumor genomic landscape: ** The mutation catalog of the tumor is compared to a reference mutation catalogue, or mutational signatures reference dataset, such as the 30 Signatures of Mutational Processes in Human Cancer from the Catalogue of Somatic Mutation In Cancer (COSMIC) database. ** De novo mutational signatures modelling can be accomplished using statistical methods such as non-negative matrix factorization to identify potential novel mutational processes. Identifying the contributions of diverse mutational signatures to carcinogenesis provides insight into tumor biology and can offer opportunities for targeted therapy. ====Types of mutations: indels==== Signature 3, seen in homologous recombination (HR) deficient tumour, is associated with increased burden of large indels (up to 50 nucleotides) with overlapping microhomology at the breakpoints. In such tumors, DNA double-strand breaks are repaired by the imprecise repair mechanisms of non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) or microhomology-mediated end joining (MMEJ) instead of high fidelity HR repair. Signature 6, seen in tumors with microsatellite instability, also features enrichment of 1bp indels in nucleotide repeat regions. ====Types of mutations: structural variants==== Homologous recombination deficiency leads to Signature 3 substitution pattern, but also to increase burden of structural variants. In the absence of homologous recombination, non-homologous end joining leads to large structural variants such as chromosomal translocations, chromosomal inversions and copy number variants. ==Mutational signatures== . ===Age- related mutagenesis=== Signature 1 features a predominance of C>T transition (genetics) in the Np[C>T]G trinucleotide contexts and correlates with the age of patient at time of cancer diagnosis. The underlying proposed biological mechanism is the spontaneous deamination of 5-methylcytosine. Signature 5 has a predominance of T>C substitutions in the ApTpN trinucleotide context with transcriptional strand bias. ===Homologous recombination deficiency=== Signature 3 displays high mutation counts of multiple mutation classes and is associated with germline and somatic (biology) BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations in several cancer types (e.g. breast, pancreatic, ovarian, prostate). This signature results from DNA double-strand break repair deficiency (or homologous recombination deficiency). Signature 3 is associated with high burden of indels with microhomology at the breakpoints. ===APOBEC enzymes=== APOBEC3 family of cytidine deaminase enzymes respond to viral infections by editing viral genome, but the enzymatic activity of APOBEC3A and APOBEC3B has also been found to cause unwanted host genome editing and may even participate to oncogenesis in human papillomavirus-related cancers. Signature 2 and Signature 13 are enriched for C>T and C>G substitutions and are thought to arise from cytidine deaminase activity of the AID/APOBEC enzymes family. A germline deletion polymorphism involving APOBEC3A and APOBEC3B is associated with high burden of Signature 2 and Signature 13 mutations. This polymorphism is considered to be of moderate penetrance (two-fold above background risk) for breast cancer risk. The exact roles and mechanisms underlying APOBEC- mediated genome editing are not yet fully delineated, but activation-induced cytidine deaminase(AID)/APOBEC complex is thought to be involved in host immune response to viral infections and lipid metabolism. Both Signature 2 and Signature 13 are feature cytosine to uracil substitutions due to cytidine deaminases. Signature 2 has a higher proportion of C[T>C]N substitutions and Signature 13 a higher proportion of T[C>G]N substitutions. APOBEC3A and APOBEC3B-mediated mutagenesis preferentially involve the lagging DNA strand during replication. ===Mismatch repair deficiency=== Four COSMIC mutational signatures have been associated with DNA mismatch repair deficiency and found in tumors with microsatellite instability: Signature 6, 15, 20 and 26. Loss of function MLH1, MSH2, MSH6 or PMS2 genes cause defective DNA mismatch repair. ===DNA proofreading=== Signature 10 has a transcriptional bias and is enriched for C>A substitutions in the TpCpT context as well as T>G substitutions in the TpTpTp context. Signature 10 is associated with altered function of DNA polymerase epsilon, which result in deficient DNA proofreading activity. Both germline and somatic POLE (gene) exonuclease domain mutations are associated with Signature 10. ===Base excision repair=== Role of MUTYH in base excision repair and somatic signature. Defective MUTYH in colorectal cancer leads to enrichment for transversion mutations (G:C>T:A), which has been linked to COSMIC Signature 18 described by Alexandrov et al (Signature 18 plot R code). Somatic enrichment for transversion mutations (G:C>T:A) has been associated with base excision repair (BER) deficiency and linked to defective MUTYH, a DNA glycosylase, in colorectal cancer. Direct DNA oxidation damage leads to the creation of 8-Oxoguanine, which if remains un-repaired, will lead to incorporation of adenine instead of cytosine during DNA replication. MUTYH encodes the adenine glycosylase enzyme which excise the mismatched adenine from 8-Oxoguanine:adenine base pairing, therefore enabling DNA repair mechanisms involving OGG1 (Oxoguanine glycosylase) and NUDT1 (Nudix hydrolase 1, also known as MTH1, MutT homolog 1) to remove the damaged 8-Oxoguanine. ===Exposures to exogenous genotoxins=== Selected exogenous genotoxins/carcinogens and their mutagen-induced DNA damage and repair mechanisms have been linked to specific molecular signatures. ====Ultraviolet radiation==== :Signature 7 has a predominance CC>TT dinucleotide mutations at the pyrimidine-pyrimidine photodimers repaired via transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair. It has a strong transcriptional bias with C>T substitutions enriched on the untranscribed DNA strand. Ultraviolet radiation exposure is the proposed underlying mutagenic mechanism of this signature. ====Alkylating agents==== :Signature 11 was identified in tumors previously exposed to Temozolamide, an alkylating agent. This signature is enriched for C>T substitutions on guanine bases due to transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair. A strong transcriptional strand-bias is present in this signature. ====Tobacco==== :Both Signature 4 (tobacco smoking, lung cancer) and Signature 29 (tobacco chewing, gingivo-buccal oral squamous cell carcinoma) display transcriptional strand-bias and enrichment for C>A substitutions, but their respective composition and patterns (proportion of each mutation types) differ slightly. :The proposed underlying mechanism of Signature 4 is the removal of DNA adducts (tobacco benzo(a)pyrene covalently bounded to guanine) by the transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair (NER) machinery. ===Immunoglobulin gene hypermutation=== Signature 9 has been identified in chronic lymphocytic leukemia and malignant B-cell lymphoma and feature enrichment for T>G transversion events. It is thought to result from error-prone polymerase ' (POLH gene)-associated mutagenesis. Recently, polymerase ' error-prone synthesis signature has been linked to non- hematological cancers (e.g. skin cancer) and was hypothesized to contribute to YCG motif mutagenesis and could partly explain the increase TC dinucleotides substitutions. ==History== During the 1980s, Curtis Harris at the US National Cancer Institute and Bert Vogelstein at the Johns Hopkins Oncology Center in Baltimore had managed to show that different types of cancer had their own unique suite of mutations in p53, which were likely to have been caused by different agents, such as the chemicals in tobacco smoke or ultraviolet light from the sun. With the advent of next-generation sequencing, Michael Stratton saw the potential for the technology to revolutionize our understanding of the genetic changes inside individual tumors, setting the Wellcome Sanger Institute's huge banks of DNA-sequencing machines in motion to read every single letter of DNA in a tumor. By 2009, Stratton and his team had produced the first whole cancer genome sequences. These were detailed maps showing all the genetic changes and mutations that had occurred within two individual cancers—a melanoma from the skin and a lung tumor. The melanoma and lung cancer genomes were powerful proof that the fingerprints of specific culprits could be seen in cancers with one major cause. These tumors still contained many mutations that could not be explained by ultraviolet light or tobacco smoking. The detective work became a lot more complicated for cancers with complex, multiple or even completely unknown origins. By way of analogy, imagine a forensic scientist dusting for fingerprints at a murder scene. The forensic scientist might strike it lucky and find a set of perfect prints on a windowpane or door handle that match a known killer. However, they are much more likely to uncover a mish-mash of fingerprints belonging to a whole range of folk—from the victim and potential suspects to innocent parties and police investigators—all laid on top of each other on all sorts of surfaces. This is very similar to cancer genomes where multiple mutational patterns are commonly overlaid one over another making the data incomprehensible. Fortunately, a PhD student of Stratton's, Ludmil Alexandrov came up with a way of mathematically solving the problem. Alexandrov demonstrated that mutational patterns from individual mutagens found in a tumor can be distinguished from one another using a mathematical approach called blind source separation. The newly disentangled patterns of mutations were termed mutational signatures. In 2013, Alexandrov and Stratton published the first computational framework for deciphering mutational signatures from cancer genomics data. Subsequently, they applied this framework to more than seven thousand cancer genomes creating the first comprehensive map of mutational signatures in human cancer. Currently, more than one hundred mutational signatures have been identified across the repertoire of human cancer. == Note list == == References == Category:Cancer research Category:Genomics Category:Mutagenesis ","title":"Mutational signatures"},{"id":"56627047","text":"Sean Rhoden, known professionally MeLo-X, is an American disc jockey and record producer. MeLo-X co-wrote two songs for Beyoncé's Lemonade album in 2016: \\"Hold-Up\\" and \\"Sorry\\". MeLo-X is one half of the electro/dancehall/reggae duo Electric Punanny, along with Jasmine Solano. They have toured internationally, performing deejay sets at festivals such as Glastonbury, Afropunk and SXSW. ==Early life== MeLo-X was born to Jamaican parents in the East Flatbush neighborhood of the New York City borough of Brooklyn. ==Career== In 2009, MeLo-X toured with Theophilus London, serving as deejay. On the side, he remixed songs from other artists, without permission. In 2014, MeLo-X remixed five songs from Beyoncé's album Beyoncé, the project titled Yoncé-X, which MeLo-X posted to various websites such as SoundCloud and YouTube. Beyoncé's label kept having the remix album removed from each new hosting site for copyright violations, but after seeing the uploaded video for \\"Drunk in Lust,\\" MeLo-X's unauthorized remix of \\"Drunk in Love,\\" Beyoncé invited him to make music for the On the Run Tour, a co-headlining tour by Jay-Z and Beyoncé. MeLo-X relates: \\"They already had the story and the outline for the tour. The whole story is like you're watching a film and it's narrated by the music that they created... We'd sit and talk about the sounds. Then I'd go and create something. It was a mix of my ideas, with Beyoncé and Jay Z. I'd try to complement them. I'd try to find a meeting point of what I do and what they wanted.\\" MeLo-X said that, for a climactic car-chase scene, he took Kanye West's song \\"Hell of a Life\\", changing and chopping it in the trap EDM style, making it into a two-minute piece to fit the concert visuals. After this, MeLo-X collaborated with Beyoncé and Jay-Z in writing two songs for Beyoncé's Lemonade album: \\"Hold-Up\\" and \\"Sorry\\". \\"Hold Up\\" was certified Gold in the U.S. and Australia, and \\"Sorry\\" was certified Platinum in the U.S. MeLo-X said he encountered the song \\"Hold Up\\" after much of it had been composed by Father John Misty and MNEK. MeLo-X wrote some of the song's lyrics, and provided background vocals, saying, \\"I love how my vocals were used because it feels like it's a sample under her voice during the chorus.\\" The song \\"Sorry\\" was co-written and co-produced by MeLo-X and Wynter Gordon. As well, MeLo-X scored the music for Beyoncé's Lemonade visual album. MeLo-X also created music and sounds for Beyoncé's The Formation World Tour. For instance, when a mechanical lift at center stage rises upward, a sound that MeLo-X designed is played to represent the movement. MeLo-X released an EP titled Curate in October 2015. The EP took the form of a software application within which the listener can move a pointer to change the beat and the reverb. MeLo-X calls the octahedron- shaped pointer the \\"infinity stone.\\" Songs on the EP feature performances by Little Simz, Raury, and Kilo Kish. The next year, PartyNextDoor hired MeLo-X to bring the same visual style to his Summer's Over Tour. MeLo-X produced and performed on a remix of the song \\"Find Your Way Back\\" on the deluxe version of Beyonce's album The Lion King: The Gift which was released on July 31, 2020, to coincide with the release of the Knowles-Carter/Disney + film Black Is King. ==Electric Punanny== In 2007, MeLo-X met Jasmine Solano at the Sway nightclub in New York City. They collaborated in 2008 to create a monthly deejay party under the name Electric Punanny. The music is a fusion of electro-funk, dancehall and reggae. Early shows were at the 205 Club, but the show gained a larger following at the Sway Lounge. The duo began to tour internationally and to release music together. In 2013, they performed in France, Japan and Australia, including a set for the Island Vibe Festival on Stradbroke Island (Minjerribah). Personal electronics maker House of Marley sponsored a tour of North America in early 2014, including a performance at the \\"Do Over Party\\" in Palm Springs after the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival. In June 2014, Electric Punanny played the Glastonbury Festival, at the Blues Stage in the Silver Hayes area. They played at the Afropunk Festival in Brooklyn in August 2014. The group's techno-dancehall mashup \\"Rosa Caleta\\" was their first release together in October 2014, the song named after a Jamaican restaurant in Berlin. After performing in China, Korea, Indonesia, the Philippines and Singapore, the duo played SXSW in March 2015. In 2017, Electric Punanny released the song \\"Tiger Eye\\" featuring Donae'o. This was followed by \\"Gymnastics On Fire\\", a summer jam featuring the Afro-R&B; collective The.Wav, released on the EPINTL label by Beatport. ==Musical style and influences== MeLo-X brings together in his music many different musical genres, especially dancehall and reggae from his family's Jamaican heritage. His deejay sets often combine tropical grooves with various hip hop and electronic dance beats. MeLo-X cites Big Pun, the Hot Boys, and rapper DMX along with his producer Swizz Beatz as inspirations for his own music career. ==Photography== After taking a trip to Equatorial Guinea and South Africa, MeLo-X had a showing of his photography in 2014 at the Sean Kelly Gallery in New York. ==Production discography== { class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text-align:center;\\" - ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:160px;\\" Title ! scope=\\"col\\"  Year ! scope=\\"col\\"  Artist(s) ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:180px;\\" Album ! scope=\\"col\\"  Writing ! scope=\\"col\\"  Producing - !scope=\\"row\\"\\"Hold Up\\"  rowspan=\\"4\\"2016  rowspan=\\"2\\"Beyoncé  rowspan=\\"2\\"Lemonade   - !scope=\\"row\\"\\"Sorry\\"   - !scope=\\"row\\"\\"Indie Girls\\"  Jesse Boykins III  Bartholomew   - !scope=\\"row\\"\\"Cleopatra\\"  Anik Khan  Kites   - !scope=\\"row\\"\\"Body\\"  rowspan=\\"4\\"2017  Syd  Fin   - !scope=\\"row\\"\\"Heebiejeebies\\"  Aminé  Good for You   - !scope=\\"row\\"\\"The Uber Song\\"  DRAM    - !scope=\\"row\\"\\"Maybe, One Day\\"  Kari Faux  Primary   - !scope=\\"row\\"\\"Boss\\"  rowspan=\\"2\\"2018  The Carters  Everything Is Love   - !scope=\\"row\\"\\"40 Shades of Choke\\"  Ari Lennox    - !scope=\\"row\\"\\"Find Your Way Back\\" (remix) 2020  Beyoncé  The Lion King: The Gift (deluxe version)   } ==References== ==External links== *MeLo-X on SoundCloud *\\"Drunk in Lust\\" on YouTube, the MeLo-X remix performance in January 2014 of Beyoncé's \\"Drunk in Love\\" song Category:1985 births Category:Living people Category:American DJs Category:Record producers from New York (state) Category:Musicians from New York City Category:American people of Jamaican descent ","title":"MeLo-X"},{"id":"56627066","text":"The men's 10 kilometre classical at the 2017 Asian Winter Games was held on 20 February 2017 at the Shirahatayama Open Stadium in Sapporo, Japan. ==Schedule== All times are Japan Standard Time (UTC+09:00) {class = \\"\\" style=\\"text-align:center;\\" ! width=220Date ! width=50Time ! width=100Event -  Thursday, 23 February 2017  11:00  bgcolor=ffffccFinal } ==Results== { class= style=\\"text- align:center\\" !width=40Rank !width=250Athlete !width=80Time -  align=left 25:15.6 -  align=left 25:32.5 -  align=left 25:39.0 - 4 align=left 25:51.1 - 5 align=left 26:08.2 - 6 align=left 26:16.6 - 7 align=left 26:27.5 - 8 align=left 26:32.3 - 9 align=left 27:21.3 - 10 align=left 27:43.8 - 11 align=left 27:58.8 - 12 align=left 28:06.6 - 13 align=left 28:18.7 - 14 align=left 29:17.1 - 15 align=left 29:38.0 - 16 align=left 30:47.8 - 17 align=left 32:47.4 - 18 align=left 36:13.8 - 19 align=left 36:48.4 - 20 align=left 41:15.2 - 21 align=left 48:51.0 - 22 align=left 1:04:30.0 } ==References== ==External links== *Results at FIS website Men 10 ","title":"Cross-country skiing at the 2017 Asian Winter Games – Men's 10 kilometre classical"},{"id":"56627067","text":"John Nevin Schaeffer (July 23, 1882 - June 10, 1942) was an American classicist from Danville, Pennsylvania who spent his career teaching at Franklin & Marshall College, from which he also received his bachelor's degree in 1903.

It has a single thin leaf and up to forty or more yellowish-green flowers. The flowers are the smallest of any Australian ground-dwelling orchid. The orchid usually grows in large colonies after fire and although small, are easily seen because of their very large numbers in their blackened surroundings. == Description == Microtis atrata is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and a single erect, smooth, more or less solid leaf, long and about wide. Between two and forty or more yellowish-green flowers are densely crowded along a flowering stem long, reaching to a height of . The plants are sometimes up to tall if growing in water. At about long and wide, the flowers are the smallest of any terrestrial Australian orchid, and as they age, they turn black. The dorsal sepal is egg-shaped to round, about long and wide and forms a hood over the column. The lateral sepals are oblong, less than long and spread apart from each other. The petals are egg-shaped and concave and the labellum is oblong to egg-shaped. Flowering occurs from September to December and is stimulated by fire the previous summer. ==Taxonomy and naming== Microtis atrata was first formally described in 1840 by John Lindley and the description was published in A Sketch of the Vegetation of the Swan River Colony. The specific epithet (atrata) is a Latin word meaning \\"dressed in black\\", referring to the colour of the dried flowers. Some authorities give this species the name Microtidium atratum but this name is not widely accepted. ==Distribution and habitat== The swamp mignonette orchid occurs in the south-west of Western Australia, the south-east of South Australia, in southern Victoria and northern Tasmania. It grows in swampy places and in winter-wet depressions, sometimes in standing water and can form colonies of enormous numbers of plants after summer fire. ==Conservation== Microtis atrata is classified as \\"not threatened\\" in Western Australia by the Western Australian Government Department of Parks and Wildlife, but is regarded as \\"endangered\\" in South Australia and as \\"rare\\" in Tasmania. == References == == External links == * atrata Category:Prasophyllinae Category:Endemic orchids of Australia Category:Orchids of South Australia Category:Orchids of Tasmania Category:Orchids of Victoria (Australia) Category:Orchids of Western Australia Category:Plants described in 1840 ","title":"Microtis atrata"},{"id":"56627703","text":"Gene Edward Veith (born October 15, 1951) is an author, scholar, and Professor of Literature emeritus at Patrick Henry College.

Jon Effuertsen, died 1683 or 1688), a townsman of Trondheim. Jonas Edvardsen did not use the surname Daae. After Jonas Edvardsen died, Simon Hoff, the chancellor of the cathedral school in Trondheim, served as Daae's guardian. The origin of Daae, the surname he adopted, is unknown or uncertain. Daae's mother was Kiersten Jensdatter (died 1683). Anders Daae is believed to have started using the surname Daae after he was admitted to the University of Copenhagen. Daae was indigent when he graduated. In Copenhagen he lived in Regentzen, a building for poor students. After he took his theology exam, he spent two years as a private tutor for a bailiff in Nordmøre, and then he traveled back to Copenhagen in 1705 with the hope of receiving a clerical position. Daae served as a provost and the parish priest at Vik in Sogn from 1708 onward, holding the position for nearly 55 years. Daae served under seven different bishops of Bergen. Bishop Erik Pontoppidan was not particularly pleased with Daae. He is said to have received his clerical position in Vik by visiting the royal castle in Copenhagen and with the assistance of Princess Sophia Hedwig. According to Lampe, Daae accumulated a fortune of 40,000 rixdollars. He owned churches along with land and tithes, as well as several other properties in both Outer and Inner Sogn. Daae married Birgitte Ludvigsdatter Munhte (1686–1770) in 1709. It was probably Birgitte that initially expanded the couple's wealth. Bishop Erik Pontoppidan carried out a visitation in 1749 and noted that Daae had accumulated much land and was considered the richest priest in the diocese. He owned both of the churches in Vik and the church in Lærdal, and he also received payment for renting land that was owned by the church or that he himself owned. In the diocese, Anders and Birgitte's sons inherited property worth 6,000 rixdollars each, and their daughters 3,000 rixdollars each. Daae is said to have been a strict priest that often reproached people for their sins. He is also believed to have been caught up by the Pietism movement, which had started in Germany. Daae established a school for commoners in 1741, and there are many local oral traditions concerning Daae as a priest in Vik. Daae died in Vik. ==Extended family== His wife Birgitte was the daughter of Ludvig Christophersen Munthe (1657–1708), the previous priest in Vik, and via her great-grandfather Ludvig Munthe she was also a second cousin of Ludvig Holberg. Birgitte's mother was Karen Leganger (daughter of the priest Iver Leganger), and she lived with her maternal grandmother Anna Finde (Leganger's widow). For a while, he had two of his sons at the same time as \\"personal curates\\" in Vik. Several of Birgitte's brothers were priests. Her sister Anna Ludvigsdatter Munthe was married to Anders Daae's curate Jens Garman. Her sister Helene was also married to a priest. ==Descendants== Anders Daae and Birgitte Munthe had eleven children (or which seven reached adulthood), giving rise to one of the largest family of civil servants in Western Norway. Around 1800 there were six parish priests from the Daae family in Sogn. By the 20th century, Anders Daae and Birgitte Munthe's descendants included at least 25 priests and many wives of priests. The surname Daae was used by Anders and Birgitte's descendants. *Anders Daae and Birgitte Ludvigsdatter née Munthe **Jonas Daae (1717–1777), parish priest in Vik (after his father) **Karen Cahtrine Daae (1718–1796), wife of Major Frederik Wilhelm Tuchsen **Christine Daae (1719-1782), wife of her father's curate Hans J.

They are primarily associated with arthropods and are the only known segmented RNA viruses that infect animal hosts. The first member of the group, the Jingmen tick virus (JMTV), was described in 2014. Another member, the Guaico Culex virus (GCXV), has a highly unusual multicomponent architecture in which the genome segments are separately enclosed in different viral capsids. ==Examples== ===Jingmen tick virus=== The first member of the group was described in 2014 and named the Jingmen tick virus (JMTV) because it was isolated from a tick sampled in Jingmen, China. It is an enveloped spherical virus slightly larger than its closest viral relatives. The JMTV genome has four segments, two of which contain genes with sequence homology to non-structural proteins found in flaviviruses, including methyltransferase and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. The putative structural proteins in the JMTV genome have no known homologs. ===Guaico Culex virus=== The Guaico Culex virus (GCXV) was reported in 2016 after isolation from Culex mosquitoes found near Guaico, Trinidad. Different isolates of the virus have either four or five genome segments, though the fifth is not essential for viral proliferation. GCXV is a multicomponent (also known as multipartite) virus in which each genome segment is enclosed in its own small enveloped viral capsid. At least three genome segments, containing genes for non-structural proteins and capsid components, must enter a cell in order to successfully infect it and reproduce the virus. Before the discovery of GMXV, multicomponent architecture had previously been reported only in viruses that infect plants and fungi, and had never been observed in an enveloped virus. ===Other viruses=== Genetic material that likely belongs to other jingmenviruses can be identified through bioinformatics. In some cases, such sequences were not recognized as viral or the segmented nature of the genome was not recognized before JMTV was described. For example, the reported genome of the dog parasite Toxocara canis was found to contain sequences with homology to JMTV, likely representing a viral infection in the parasite that was sequenced. The Mogiana tick virus, first reported in 2011, is a similar example; its segmented genome was not recognized on first publication but was reanalyzed and identified as a jingmenvirus in 2017. Sequences with homology to JMTV have also been isolated from a red colobus monkey, suggesting the possibility of a segmented, possibly multicomponent virus capable of infecting primates. A metagenomics study of arthropod flaviviruses identified five additional examples of likely jingmenvirus sequences. ==Evolution== Jingmenviruses are related to flaviviruses, which have non-segmented genomes transmitted in a single capsid. Homology has consistently been observed between the genes encoding non- structural proteins of jingmenviruses and flaviviruses, including RNA- dependent RNA polymerase. However, the genomic architecture of the homologous genes varies significantly; the canonical flavivirus genome consists of a single open reading frame (ORF) whose protein product is processed by proteases, whereas the non-structural jingmenvirus proteins are encoded on two genome segments, each containing one ORF. Although there are few known jingmenvirus sequences, the gene composition of the genome segments appears to be well-conserved. By contrast, the putative jingmenvirus structural proteins that likely make up its capsids have no homology to known proteins. It is striking that the segmented jingmenviruses' closest known relatives are nonsegmented. The evolutionary mechanisms underlying genome segmentation and especially multicomponent architecture are poorly understood. Although segmented genomes appear to have evolved several times in the virome, the evolutionary mechanism underlying this structure is unclear. It is likewise unclear whether multicomponent architecture is a distinct evolutionary strategy or is an artifact of the mechanism of segmentation, possibly via the formation of defective interfering particles. ==References== Category:Positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses ","title":"Jingmenvirus"},{"id":"56627827","text":"Rust is an unincorporated community in Eastern Township, Franklin County, Illinois, United States.

His name was classified until 1987. == Biography == Huang was born on 12 March 1926 in Swabue, Kwangtung Province, of Jieyang ancestry. He graduated from Shanghai Jiao Tong University in 1949. After the Sino-Soviet split, Marshal Nie Rongzhen proposed that China develop its own nuclear submarines to break the duopoly of the United States and the Soviet Union, and Mao Zedong accepted the suggestion. In 1958, Huang was among the 29 people selected to develop the program, meant to bolster China's nuclear deterrence against the US and the USSR. They were based in Huludao, a port on the Bohai Sea in Liaoning Province. At the time China was in the midst of the great famine caused by the Great Leap Forward, and technical knowledge was severely limited. Huang and his colleagues had very primitive resources, using abacuses to do calculations and gathering information from foreign newspapers. When a Chinese diplomat brought from the US toy models of the George Washington-class submarine, Huang was elated to find out that the design his team had made on paper was almost identical to the models. When the turmoil of the Cultural Revolution swept through China, Huang and other engineers came under persecution. In the late 1960s, Huang, together with scientist Qian Lingxi, was attacked for his \\"reactionary\\" background and sent to perform hard labour in the countryside, where he spent two years raising pigs. In retrospect, Huang remembered these years as \\"the only easy time\\" of his life, as he had no responsibilities other than feeding the pigs. In 1970, the Long March I, China's first nuclear submarine, began maritime tests. She entered service in 1974, making China the fifth country to own a nuclear submarine, after the United States, the USSR, the United Kingdom, and France. The boat was decommissioned more than four decades later, and is now displayed in the Chinese Navy Museum in Qingdao. In 1979, Huang was appointed as one of the three deputies to the first chief designer Peng Shilu, for China's nuclear submarine project, and the other two were and Huang Weilu. The first nuclear- powered ballistic missile submarine (SSBN) of class 092 was completed and commissioned in 1981. In 1983, Huang Xuhua succeeded Peng as the 2nd chief designer and continued working on the nuclear submarine project. ==Honours and publicity== In November 2017, Huang was awarded the honour of \\"National Model for Virtue\\". In a nationally televised ceremony in Beijing, to show his respect for two senior citizens who dedicated their lives to contribute to the nation, Paramount leader Xi Jinping personally invited Huang to sit next to him for a group photo. The event was widely reported in Chinese media. In September 2019, Huang was awarded the Medal of the Republic, China's highest order of honour. In January 2020, he was conferred the Highest Science and Technology Award, together with meteorologist Zeng Qingcun. Huang was often hailed in Chinese media as \\"the father of China's nuclear submarines\\", but this has been disputed by the naval writer Li Zhongxiao and some scientific- technical staff of the first generation of China's nuclear submarines. According to them, the nuclear submarine was developed by many scientists and did not have a single \\"father\\"; and if a single person were to be considered the \\"father\\", it should be Peng Shilu, the first chief designer, not Huang, who succeeded Peng as the second chief designer. == Personal life == Huang is married and has three daughters. His immediate family moved with him to Huludao for his secret mission, but he had to reduce contact with the rest of his family. He only rarely visited his parents in Guangdong, who had no idea what he was doing until his role was made public in a 1987 magazine article. == References == Category:1926 births Category:Living people Category:Engineers from Guangdong Category:Members of the Chinese Academy of Engineering Category:Chinese naval architects Category:People from Shanwei Category:Recipients of the Order of the Republic (China) Category:Shanghai Jiao Tong University alumni Category:Submarine design ","title":"Huang Xuhua"},{"id":"56628010","text":"Justin Michael Herold (born January 11, 1991) is an American professional basketball player for Iwate Big Bulls in Japan. ==References== ==External links== *Sonoma State bio Category:1991 births Category:Living people Category:American expatriate basketball people in Argentina Category:American expatriate basketball people in Japan Category:American men's basketball players Category:Basketball players from California Category:Cyberdyne Ibaraki Robots players Category:Iwate Big Bulls players Category:Junior college men's basketball players in the United States Category:Otsuka Corporation Alphas players Category:Sonoma State Seawolves men's basketball players Category:Sportspeople from Santa Rosa, California Category:Tokyo Excellence players Category:Unión de Santa Fe basketball players Category:Power forwards (basketball) ","title":"Justin Herold"},{"id":"56628011","text":"Energi Mine is a United Kingdom based blockchain technology company, that develops products in the energy management sector.

Formed in May 2012 and named after the early Kurdish Muslim leader Saladin, the group was led by defected Syrian Army Captain Bewar Mustafa and fought against Syrian government forces in and around the city of Aleppo. It was also strongly opposed to the Kurdish-led Democratic Union Party (PYD), and have clashed with the PYD-affiliated People's Protection Units (YPG) and the Women's Protection Units (YPJ) several times. ==Ideology== Although the majority of fighters within the Saladin Ayubi Brigade were Kurds, the group also contained Arabs and Turkmen. Capt. Bewar Mustafa, commander of the group, stated during an interview in February 2013 that \\"We believe in democracy, equal rights for all, and representation. This is automatically against sectarianism. We are the Free Syrian Army for all Syrians, not just for one group, and the Kurds in this are a moderating force.\\" Lieutenant Colonel Shawqi Othman, another commander in the group, also stated that \\"We want a civil, democratic government which treats everyone equally\\". Despite ideological differences, the Saladin Ayubi Brigade closely cooperated with Islamist rebel groups, including the al-Tawhid Brigade and the Free Syria Brigade. The group defended this alliance by claiming that it was a way for them to \\"pay its dues to the revolution\\". It also fought alongside the Salafist jihadist al-Nusra Front. However, Capt. Mustafa exclaimed that \\"I swear to God, if some radicals want to go kill the Alawites, we will fight with our guns and die to defend the Alawites because we are the army for all Syrians.\\" In response to accusations that the Saladin Ayubi Brigade served agendas of Turkey, Mustafa replied with \\"First, I am a Kurd. I am proud of my nation. I do not need Turkey or any other country to guide me.\\" In addition, Mustafa denied any affiliation with Salah Badr al-Din's wing of the Kurdish Freedom Party. Mustafa also stated in August 2013 that due to ideological differences, he will not join \\"any Kurdish project that has the YPG in it\\". Lt. Col. Othman claimed that the PYD and PKK were allied with the Syrian government. Mohammed Suleiman, an activist who worked with the Saladin Ayubi Brigade, called the PKK \\"mercenaries and criminals\\". Despite this, he stated that \\"If the choice is between Jabhat al-Nusra or the PKK, I will always choose the PKK.\\" ==History== ===Establishment and early activities=== The Saladin Ayubi Battalion was formed in May 2012 by a group of armed Kurdish rebels, among them university students, in a village near Afrin. On 12 May, Captain Bewar Mustafa, a military engineer in the Syrian Army, defected to join the Free Syrian Army in the city of al-Rastan. Mustafa was among the FSA officers who met with members of the United Nations Supervision Mission in Syria in Rastan. Later in mid-2012, Mustafa contacted members of the Saladin Ayubi Battalion and arrived in Afrin to join the group as its commander. After more fighters joined the group, it was renamed as the Saladin Ayubi Brigade. It participated in clashes against government forces around Aleppo, before entering the city itself and taking part in the Battle of Aleppo. Under the command of Capt. Mustafa, the group fought in the Karm al-Jabal, Ashrafiya, Khalidiya, and Bani Zaid neighbourhoods of Aleppo city. It also took part in the Siege of Menagh Air Base, the Siege of Nubl and Al-Zahraa, and cooperated with the Azadî Battalion along the frontline south of Aleppo International Airport. On 26 October 2012, clashes erupted between the YPG and other rebel groups, including the Saladin Ayubi Brigade, in the Ashrafiya neighbourhood of Aleppo. During the clashes on 1 November, the Saladin Ayubi Brigade captured Nujin Derik, a female YPG commander. The group, however, denied involvement in the clashes, and stated that it did not want to fight the YPG in Kurdish areas. On 5 November, a ceasefire agreement was signed between the YPG and PYD and FSA groups in Aleppo, promising the release of prisoners and closer cooperation in the fight against the Assad government. Derik was released 5 days later. ===Later activities and dissolution=== Capt. Bewar Mustafa, former commander of the Saladin Ayubi Brigade, considers Kurdish fighters in the Turkish-backed Free Syrian Army (pictured participating in the Turkish military operation in Afrin, January 2018) to be \\"mercenaries\\". On 15 April 2013, 8 defected Kurdish military officers from Syria, including Lt. Col. Shawqi Othman of the Saladin Ayubi Brigade, were kidnapped at the Iraq–Syria border by unknown parties. The officers were heading to Iraqi Kurdistan to join the Peshmerga. One of the officers' relatives accused the PYD of involvement in their abductions. In September 2013, clashes renewed between the YPG and its ally, the Kurdish Front, and other rebel groups in Aleppo, including the Saladin Ayubi Brigade, part of the Syrian Kurdish Revolutionary Council (Komala). On 19 September, the 16th Division was formed, with the Saladin Ayubi Brigade as a member group. The pro-PYD Firat News Agency considered fighters of the group to be \\"mercenaries\\", and the 16th Division itself was considered \\"criminal gangs\\" by some residents in Aleppo, resulting in the group being attacked by Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant since October 2013. As part of the 16th Division, the Saladin Ayubi Brigade fought ISIL in Aleppo at the end of 2013. On 4 April 2014, the Syrian Kurdish Revolutionary Council (Komala), having left the 16th Division, joined the Syrian Revolutionaries Front. In its accession statement, Capt. Bewar Mustafa called the PYD \\"tools of repression and intimidation by the Assad regime\\". Despite this, Mustafa and the Komala announced solidarity with Kobanî when ISIL attacked the city in September 2014, and demanded the SRF to provide military assistance to the YPG-led forces fighting against the ISIL offensive. Komala withdrew from the SRF on 6 October when it failed to respond. In 2015, Captain Bewar Mustafa laid down his arms, and the Saladin Ayubi Brigade last appeared in July 2015. During the Operation Olive Branch in early 2018, Mustafa called FSA fighters participating in the offensive \\"mercenaries\\" and \\"a tool in the hands of their masters, even against their own kinsmen\\". He also claimed that \\"both sides are going to lose\\". ==See also== *Descendants of Saladin Brigade *YPG–FSA relations ==Notes== ==References== Category:Military units and formations established in 2012 Category:Military units and formations disestablished in 2015 Category:Free Syrian Army Category:Anti- government factions of the Syrian Civil War Category:Anti-ISIL factions in Syria Category:Syrian Kurdish organizations Category:2012 establishments in Syria ","title":"Saladin Ayubi Brigade"},{"id":"56628189","text":"Gay House may refer to: *Gay House (Montgomery, Alabama) *Ebenezer Gay House, Sharon, Connecticut *Mary Gay House, Decatur, Georgia *Charles Gay House, Waimea, Hawaii *Wilbur D. and Hattie Cannon House, Iowa City, Iowa, also known as the Cannon-Gay House *Andrew H.

The temptation to call it a pastiche is too easy to drape over this mammoth construction of color and texture in sound. Before this suite begins -- and it is actually more like a symphony than a jazz suite -- there are three Rüegg compositions that set the audience up for the drama. ... When the \\"Suite\\" finally begins, listeners are almost taken off guard since it sounds like a coda. Before the vibes and trumpets go into a dance of intricate counterpoint, the band plays \\"fliessend,\\" smoothly and evenly, and the movement becomes almost contemplative, with the exception of the two contrapuntal instruments now playing in restrained tones. As the bop horn lines state the theme for the rest of the suite, short, choppy interludes of dissonance and even sets of quiet tone rows are inserted into the melody! Rüegg's harmonic sensibility is so developed that he has no difficulties in traversing isorhythms to get to his desired place. By the time the last movement is reached, one would swear that all elegiac notions have been left behind in order to join Buddy Rich and Count Basie in a Kansas City block party.

It is usually implemented as part of the central processing unit (CPU). MPU is a trimmed down version of memory management unit (MMU) providing only memory protection support. It is usually implemented in low power processors that require only memory protection and do not need the full fledged feature of a memory management unit like virtual memory management. == Overview == The MPU allows the privileged software to define memory regions and assign memory access permission and memory attributes to each of them. Depending on the implementation of the processor, the number of supported memory regions will vary. The MPU on ARMv8-M processors supports up to 16 regions. The memory attributes define the ordering and merging behaviors of these regions, as well as caching and buffering attributes. Cache attributes can be used by internal caches, if available, and can be exported for use by system caches. MPU monitors transactions, including instruction fetches and data accesses from the processor, which can trigger a fault exception when an access violation is detected. The main purpose of memory protection is to prevent a process from accessing memory that has not been allocated to it. This prevents a bug or malware within a process from affecting other processes, or the operating system itself. == See also == * Memory management unit * Memory protection ==References== Category:Central processing unit Category:Digital circuits Category:Memory management ","title":"Memory protection unit"},{"id":"56628332","text":"Salahuddin Ahmed (born 1960/61) is a Bangladesh Nationalist Party politician who served as the state minister of communication and a member of parliament from Cox's Bazar-1 constituency.

Gajda was convicted, exonerated, then convicted a second-time on a variety of charges ranging from espionage to mutiny and dismissed from the Czechoslovak Army, though the evidence against him has subsequently come under scrutiny. The Gajda Affair has been said to have demonstrated the ability of the Czechoslovak government to maintain civilian control over the armed forces during a period of heightened political tension in many parts of Europe. ==Background== Gen. Radola Gajda (pictured, c. 1919) was the central figure in the Gajda Affair. In 1926 Gen. Radola Gajda, a right-wing Czechoslovak army officer, was given the provisional appointment of chief of the army staff while a new cabinet was being formed following recently concluded elections. In May of that year a military coup in neighboring Poland, press denouncements of Gajda in left- leaning newspapers, and the approach of the Sokol congress – which some felt might be used by Gajda to stage an event similar to Mussolini's March on Rome – combined to create heightened political tension in Czechoslovakia. The general did not publicly dispute the swirling rumors that he was plotting against the government as military regulations prevented him from issuing statements to the media of his own accord; this contributed to the air of uncertainty. Adding to the complexity of the situation, the USSR – which sought to settle an old score with Gajda – began to secretly feed the Czechoslovak government fabricated information that made Gajda appear to be a Soviet agent. ==Trials== On July 2, President of Czechoslovakia Tomáš Garrigue Masaryk placed Gajda on medical leave and ordered an investigation into his activities. In December 1926 a military tribunal concluded Gadja had provided an agent of the USSR secret French war plans six years prior and ordered his dismissal from the army with a 25 percent cut in pension. The veracity of allegations as to Gajda's alleged contacts with Soviet officials have come under scrutiny as he was known to be virulently anti-Communist. Additionally, subsequently declassified correspondence among French officials has revealed their disbelief that Gajda might even have had access to such plans in 1920, during a period where he was posted to Paris on a training mission. According to prosecutors, Gajda had approached Gen. Josef Šnejdárek (pictured) with a plot to overthrow the Czechoslovak government. In 1927 Gajda successfully sued the two witnesses who had testified at his court martial for defamation over the allegations they'd made against him. Encapsulating the intrigue of the time, a United Press story that year reported that \\"Gajda has been known to Czeho-Slovakians as a national hero, a spy, and a suspicious militarist of German origin\\". In response to Gajda's exoneration in civil court, the Czechoslovak government produced new evidence against him in the form of telegrams it claimed to have intercepted and decoded in 1921. It also alleged he had discussed the overthrow of the Czechoslovak government with Josef Šnejdárek. Gajda was ordered to stand trial anew in 1928 and was again convicted on all counts, with his 25 percent loss of pension being reaffirmed. Historian Jonathan Zorach has questioned the conclusion of the second court martial by noting that Šnejdárek and Gajda were not on close terms and Šnejdárek would have been an unusual choice for a confidante for Gajda. Gerald Protheroe has also questioned why the Czechoslovak government, had it intercepted telegrams in 1921, would have waited five years to act upon them. ==Aftermath== In the aftermath of the Gajda Affair, legislation was advanced by the Czechoslovak government to disenfranchise the army officer corps and the gendarmerie as a means of neutralizing the military as a political force. The Gajda Affair has been said to have demonstrated the ultimate ability of the Czechoslovakian civilian government to maintain its supremacy over the armed forces during a fragile period for democracy in many parts of Europe. It also served to splinter the political right among veterans of the Czechoslovak Legion. ==See also== * 1948 Czechoslovak coup d'état ==References== Category:1926 in Czechoslovakia Category:1927 in Czechoslovakia Category:1928 in Czechoslovakia Category:Attempted coups d'état Category:Military history of Czechoslovakia ","title":"Gajda Affair"},{"id":"56628460","text":"Plassey Monument Palashi Monument is a monument in Palashi (Plassey), Nadia district, in the state of West Bengal.

(doing business as Patel Brothers) is an Indian-American supermarket chain based in Hanover Park, Illinois. Patel Brothers is the largest Indian-American supermarket chain in the United States with 57 locations in 19 states, primarily in New Jersey, due to its large Indian population. Patel Brothers offers online shopping for the contiguous US through its website, which is fulfilled by its Hanover Park, Illinois location. The chain was founded by brothers Mafat and Tulsi Patel and is operated by Mafat's sons, Swetal and Rakesh Patel. ==History== Mafat lived in Bhandu, a small village in Gujarat, India, along with his brother, Tulsi before coming to Indiana University for an MBA in 1968. After finishing his business degree, he moved to Chicago to work as an engineer at Jefferson Electrical Co. Mafat found that Indian groceries were expensive and hard to find in Chicago, which inspired him to start a grocery store. The first Patel Brothers store opened on Devon Street in 1974, and was operated jointly by Mafat, Tulsi and his wife Aruna, the latter two of which had immigrated from India to help with the store. As of 2017, Patel Brothers has grown into a $140 million chain of stores. On Devon Avenue in Chicago, the street that the first restaurant was opened on, there are many different shops that are part of the Patel Brothers chain: Air Tours Inc., a travel agency; Sahil, a clothing boutique meant for Indian weddings (another location in Iselin, NJ); Patel Bros. Handicrafts and Utensils, which sells religious memorabilia and trinkets; and Patel's Café, an eatery; and Mysore Woodlands, a restaurant. Patel Brothers maintains its trademarks under PB Brands LLC, which include Dakshin, an Indian restaurant with locations in the Chicago suburbs of Schaumburg and Naperville, Illinois. The first Patel Brothers, on Devon Avenue in Chicago, that opened in 1974. Patel Brothers is a family business. The retail chain's day-to-day operations are handled by Mafat's sons Swetal and Rakesh Patel, who also operate the Chicago warehouse in Skokie, Illinois. Mafat and Tulsi Patel still own the original store in Chicago and various trademarks. Tulsi Patel's daughter, Susan Patel owns Patel Bros. Handicrafts and Utensils in Chicago. Mafat's sister's sons Mahedra and Harshad operate the two New York warehouses in Queens. They have strongly built the company in the East Coast. Mafat's nephews Bharat and Jayesh manage the stores in Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, and Texas. ==Locations== ===Current locations=== Flushing, New York; Hyattsville, Maryland; and Waltham, Massachusetts. After starting out in Chicago, Patel Brothers was a major success with shoppers coming from all over the United States: Wisconsin, Minnesota, Indiana, Michigan, Iowa, and Kansas. The retail chain has spread throughout the United States, mainly the Eastern United States. As of April 2018, the chain had 55 locations, 8 in New Jersey (notably along Oak Tree Road in Edison and Iselin, which has three locations), 6 in Texas, 4 in New York, Florida, and Illinois each, and the rest are spread throughout the eastern United States with one location in Santa Clara near San Jose, California. Patel Brothers are generally located in retail parks along with other stores and restaurants. The largest store is located in Naperville, Illinois, which includes a restaurant called Patel's Fresh Kitchen. The Naperville and Parlin, New Jersey are built using modern architecture. The Patel Brothers locations that are farmers markets include: *Charlotte, North Carolina *Decatur, Georgia *Indianapolis, Indiana *Irving, Texas (the location adjacent to Valley Ranch) *Jersey City, New Jersey *Hicksville, New York *Monroeville, Pennsylvania *North Attleboro, Massachusetts *Shrewsbury, Massachusetts *Troy, Michigan The locations in Iselin, New Jersey east of the Garden State Parkway, Jersey City, New Jersey, North Brunswick, New Jersey and Ridgeland, Mississippi operate under the cash and carry concept. Several Patel Brothers locations including the McKinney, Texas; Naperville, Illinois; and Monroeville, Pennsylvania stores have green and yellow auto rickshaws near the store to maintain India's cultural identity in America. Some locations go by names other than Patel Brothers: the Ridgeland, Mississippi store operates under the name Patel Grocery and the Manchester, Connecticut store operates under the name Patel Foods. Patel Brothers is not affiliated with the gas station called Patel's Grocery in Homer, Georgia, Shah and Patel Indian Burmese grocery store in Rockville, Maryland, or Patel Foods Indo-Pak grocery store in Overland Park, Kansas. The reason why many Indian grocery stores have similar names to Patel Brothers is that PB Brands, LLC only has trademarks for the names Patel Brothers, Patel's, and Patel's Cash and Carry. There are Patel Brothers locations on Devon Avenue's Desi Street in Chicago, Mahatma Gandhi District in Houston, India Square in Jersey City, New Jersey, and Patel Plaza (retail park leased by Patel Brothers) in Decatur, Georgia, where they are located in ethnic enclaves known as Little India, next to many other Indian restaurants and stores. ===Former locations=== Previously in Canada, Patel Brothers used to operate 3 stores in the Greater Toronto Area in Scarborough, Etobicoke, and Mississauga, which are now operated by Canada-based Panchvati Supermarket, and a store in Sugar Land in Greater Houston. ==Brands and products== After Mafat and Tulsi Patel started their career as grocers they changed gears toward prepackaged ethnic foods. In 1991, they introduced a variety of authentic foods under the umbrella of Raja Foods LLC, which supplies for 60% of Patel Brothers products. Raja Foods LLC operates under seven brands, three of which are Patel Brothers original brands: *SWAD (Best Taste in Town) is an original Patel Brothers brand and is the main brand for Patel Brothers products. SWAD is the largest selling Indian food brand in the USA. Swad (स्वाद) is a Hindi word meaning taste. The main products of the SWAD brand are ghee, oil, lentils, beans, nuts, and spices. *Patel's Celebrating India is also a Patel Brothers original brand. *Anarkali is also a Patel Brothers original brand. *Ching's Secret (Real Chinese...Tasty Chinese) *Parle Products *Milhaas *Noorjehan Raja Foods LLC has 5 warehouses: *Skokie, Illinois, the 60,000 square foot warehouse located in the Chicago metropolitan area, receives food products such as rice, spices, and mango juices from around the world including China, Australia, England, Spain, India, and Pakistan, which are then to distributed to local carriers such as Kmart, Whole Foods Market, Dominick's in Chicago (former), Michael's Fresh Market in Naperville, Illinois (former), Indian ethnic stores, and various smaller carriers. The warehouse serves the Midwest and also has additional office space for Patel Brothers. *Queens, New York (2 warehouses: Flushing and Maspeth), (the latter is a vegetable warehouse) located in the New York metropolitan area, serves the Northeastern United States *Stone Mountain, Georgia located in the Atlanta metropolitan area, serves the Southeastern United States *Houston, Texas, serves the Southwestern United States Patel Brothers sells South Asian cuisine including Indian, Pakistani, and Bangladeshi food products.

It started as an organised activity in Sweden around 2016 and spread to other countries in 2018, following increased concern about plastic pollution. As a workout, it provides variation in body movements by adding bending, squatting and stretching to the main action of running, hiking, or walking. ==Examples and initiatives== Erik Ahlström started plogging in the Swedish capital city, Stockholm, when he moved there from the Åre ski resort. He created the website Plogga to organise the activity and encourage volunteers. Author David Sedaris combines litter picking with exercise in the Parham, Coldwaltham and Storrington districts of West Sussex, taking up to 60,000 steps a day in pursuit of local rubbish. He was so effective in keeping his neighbourhood clean that the local authority named a waste vehicle in his honour. The Lord Lieutenant of West Sussex, Susan Pyper, said \\"The sign on this truck is a very fitting way to say a huge ‘thank you’ to David for his tireless efforts ... he is a real local hero.\\" The Keep America Beautiful organisation is now promoting plogging to its affiliates and has found that some already combined exercise with clean up, such as the Trashercize program in Tennessee. In New York, a Meetup group, Plogging NYC, had about 100 members in 2018, with events in four boroughs.

Rosson instructed the commander of the 173rd Airborne Brigade, Brigadier General Leo H. Schweiter, to locate and destroy the People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN) 95th Regiment, which was believed to be located in a base area known as “The Hub” in the foothills northwest of Tuy Hòa in Phú Yên Province. When the Battle of Dak To intensified in early November, the 173rd Airborne Brigade was called back to the Đắk Tô area and responsibility for the operation fell to the newly-arrived 3rd Battalion, 503rd Infantry Regiment. ==Operation== UH-1Ds landing near 17th Cavalry positions, 21 September 1967 The operation began uneventfully and in mid- December following the end of the Battle of Dak To, the Brigade headquarters and the 4th Battalion, 503rd Infantry, returned to join the operation. In late December after Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) forces had been ambushed in the Ky Lo Valley, 45 kilometers northwest of Tuy Hòa, the commander of the 3/503rd Lt. Col. John R. D. Cleland landed a scout platoon there on 27 December. The platoon came under heavy fire after landing and Lt. Col. Cleland landed the remainder of his battalion in the area to engage the PAVN force. Company A landed near the hamlet of Xom Dap, 2km south of the initial contact area in a 200m by 50m landing zone surrounded by hedges and trees. PAVN forces in bunkers around the landing zone opened fire on the Company as soon as they touched down, killing or wounding numerous Americans and destroying one helicopter. Company A fought back and gradually began to destroy the PAVN bunkers. At approximately 15:30 the PAVN broke contact when a company from 4/503rd Infantry was landed nearby. 62 PAVN were killed for the loss of 12 Americans killed. Operational results to the end of December were 693 PAVN/VC killed and 228 individual and 19 crew-served weapons captured. U.S. losses were 67 killed. ==Aftermath== The operation continued until 31 January 1969. US sources claim that PAVN losses in the operation were in excess of 693 killed and 59 captured. 103 PAVN structures and 177 bunkers were destroyed, but a further 4,000 civilian structures were also destroyed, displacing about 20,000 civilians. ==References== Category:1967 in Vietnam Category:1968 in Vietnam Category:1969 in Vietnam Category:Battles and operations of the Vietnam War Category:Battles and operations of the Vietnam War in 1967 Category:Battles and operations of the Vietnam War in 1968 Category:Battles and operations of the Vietnam War in 1969 Category:History of Phú Yên Province ","title":"Operation Bolling"},{"id":"56628731","text":"Abdul Minty (otherwise known as Abdul Samad Minty) (born 31 October 1939) is a South African diplomat.

He was a candidate for the succession of Mohammed ElBaradei as Director-General of the IAEA. ==Early life== Minty was born in Hartebeesfontein, South Africa. He grew up in Johannesburg but left the country for the UK in 1958. ==Working against apartheid== Minty presented the IOC 1962 material on racism in South African sports, which led in 1963 to exclude South Africa from the Olympic Games. Following his studies, he was a researcher at the Richardson Institute for Conflict and Peace Research in London from 1969 to 1975. In 1979 he went to Norway to lead the \\"World Campaign against Military and Nuclear Cooperation with South Africa\\" in Oslo. This initiative was committed to respecting the 1977 arms embargo against South Africa and South Africa's (then only suspected) nuclear weapons program. Minty repeatedly raised these questions in the UN committees, such as the Special Committee against Apartheid, or the OAU . He was also a researcher at the International Peace Research Institute in Oslo during this time. ==After apartheid== Minty returned to South Africa in 1995. His experience and contacts were in demand in post-apartheid South Africa . He was Deputy Director-General of the South African Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Chairman of the WMD Non-Proliferation Council, which is responsible for export control of nuclear materials. In 1995, he was also South Africa's ambassador to the IAEA Board of Governors in Vienna. Minty was committed to global nuclear disarmament, but also to the spread of peaceful nuclear technologies. In November 2008, South Africa's Minister of Mining and Energy, Patience, announced Sonjica Minty's candidacy for succeeding Mohammed el-Baradei, whose term ended on November 30, 2009, as IAEA Director-General. His candidacy was supported primarily by developing and emerging countries.

The book charts his life and work with his best friend Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. in their leadership of the Civil Rights Movement to help African Americans obtain equal rights with white Americans. His book engendered much controversy due to Abernathy's allegations of King's infidelity the night before he was assassinated. ==Background== Ralph Abernathy was a leader of the civil rights movement, along with Martin Luther King Jr., whom he met in 1954; they eventually became close friends . Abernathy collaborated with King on many successful nonviolent movements. Including their creation of the Montgomery Improvement Association, which led to the Montgomery bus boycott. The King and Abernathy partnership spearheaded movements as well in Albany, Georgia; Birmingham, Alabama; Mississippi; Washington, D.C.; Selma, Alabama; St. Augustine, Florida; Chicago; Memphis, and other cities. King and Abernathy shared a close relationship in their participation in the movement, sometimes sharing the same hotel rooms and leisure time with family and friends. Their relationship was so strong that they would dine together frequently, and each other's children called the other \\"Uncle\\". They were jailed a total of 17 times together for their involvement in the movement. After King's assassination, Abernathy assumed control of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, and continued to lead movements that he and King had discussed as well as other anti-segregation movements around the Capital Beltway. Abernathy's reasons for writing the book have been questioned; the book has been described as a biography of King as much as it is an autobiography of Abernathy. > As I listened to Ralph Abernathy and his eloquent and generous introduction > and then thought about myself, I wondered who he was talking about. It's > always good to have your closest friend and associate to say something good > about you, and Ralph Abernathy is the best friend that I have in the world. > — Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., during his last speech ever delivered I've > Been to the Mountaintop ==Synopsis== Ralph Abernathy in 1968 Abernathy relates the story of his close relationship with King. The book begins with details of his participation in the Montgomery bus boycott. He details how he was surprised to hear King's selection as leader of the Montgomery Improvement Association (MIA), but stated that he wished he had nominated him for the role himself. The autobiography details how he was elected program organizer, which made him the chief organizer of activities for the group. Abernathy states how this working relationship worked well as it split most of the responsibilities of the MIA between himself and King. There are some details of Abernathy which do not match up with accounts made by King himself about the closeness of their relationship, but Abernathy asserts a very close relationship in the book, stating he and King \\"tried to meet for dinner every day\\" during the Montgomery boycott. The overall narrative paints an intertwined life between Abernathy and King. It details how King found Abernathy at an Atlanta church, and how the two became close friends and co-activists. The duo of Abernathy and King is described as being extremely well-known wherever they went together. Abernathy describes how women would bring food to them to thank them for their efforts in their communities. The two frequently shared the same jail cell together during their many arrests for their protest actions. The two are described as so inseparable that Bull Connor, the elected Commissioner of Public Safety for the city of Birmingham, Alabama, termed them the \\"Gold Dust Twins\\" and required that both be put in solitary confinement as he said, \\"These two have never been separate...\\". It was during this separation that King wrote the famous Letter from Birmingham Jail on April 16, 1963. In the book Abernathy recounts King's declining health during the movement in Selma in 1965. He describes how after a meeting with President Johnson, King had to be rushed to a hospital. Abernathy stated that this was a recurring stomach illness that plagued King during the entire course of their movement. In the book he also notably revealed King's marital infidelity, claiming that King had sexual relations with two women on the night of April 3, 1968 (after his \\"I've Been to the Mountaintop\\" speech that day), the night before he was assassinated. Abernathy also explains his controversial endorsement of Ronald Reagan for president, but contrasts this with details of his frustrating efforts to collaborate with the Reagan administration after the election. He also detailed his thoughts on the status of the leadership of the civil rights movement in America, including discrediting Jesse Jackson among other prominent black leaders at the time. ==Controversy== The book's revelations became the source of much controversy, as did Abernathy. Jesse Jackson and other civil rights activists made a statement in October 1989—after the book's release—that the book was \\"slander\\" and that \\"brain surgery\\" must have altered Abernathy's perception. Jackson, Andrew Young, and more than two dozen other prominent black leaders held a press conference at King's graveside to condemn Abernathy's allegations. A review in the Chicago Tribune stated of the book: \\"Here is a man at pains to paint himself as closer than a brother to King: his confidant, alter-ego and most trusted adviser. And then he proves his closeness by betraying the confidence.\\" ==See also== *Albany Movement *Charles Sherrod *Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee *Why We Can't Wait ==References== Category:American autobiographies Category:Civil rights movement Category:Martin Luther King Jr. Category:Books about activism Category:Books about activists Category:1989 non-fiction books ","title":"And the Walls Came Tumbling Down"},{"id":"56628793","text":"AAI Group of Companies is one of the largest Filipino-owned logistics company.

The same requirement is applied to academy schools via their funding agreements, so it is true to say that all maintained schools in England and Wales are subject to the same rules. However, in practice there is widespread non-compliance with the legislation, which has not been monitored by Ofsted since 2004. The responsibility for ensuring that the rules are applied rests with a school's head teacher, its governing body and the Local Education Authority. Local Education Authorities normally exercise this function via a Standing Advisory Council for Religious Education (SACRE). == Definition & Aims of Collective Worship == Guidance from the Department for Education (DfE) defines worship in this context as \\"reverence or veneration paid to a divine being or power.\\" It makes a distinction between the terms \\"collective worship\\" and \\"corporate worship\\", with the latter being worship amongst a group with beliefs in common. It also describes the aims of the legislation as follows: \\"Collective worship in schools should aim to provide the opportunity for pupils to worship God, to consider spiritual and moral issues and to explore their own beliefs; to encourage participation and response, whether through active involvement in the presentation of worship or through listening to and joining in the worship offered; and to develop community spirit, promote a common ethos and shared values, and reinforce positive attitudes.\\" == Required Attributes of Collective Worship == The nature of the required daily act of collective worship in England and Wales is set out in Schedule 20 of the School Standards and Framework Act. This defines collective worship as \\"a single act of worship for all pupils\\" or separate acts of worship for groups of pupils. It should normally take place on school premises. The nature of the acts of worship should take into account the ages, aptitudes and family backgrounds of the pupils. Schools with a formal faith designation are required to arrange worship in accordance with their trust deed or, if they have no trust deed, in line with the practices of their designated faith. For schools without a formal faith designation, the majority of the acts of worship should be \\"of a broadly Christian character\\". In practical terms, this has been interpreted to mean that 51% of school days each school term must have an act of worship of a broadly Christian character. The legislation is supplemented by non-statutory DfE guidance. This makes it clear that sixth-formers can decide for themselves whether or not to take part in collective worship. It also sets out circumstances under which a local SACRE can grant a formal determination that an individual school can provide alternatives to the \\"broadly Christian\\" collective worship arrangements required by the legislation. While head teachers have a duty to ensure that the law on collective worship is upheld within their school, they cannot themselves be required to participate in it, or to direct other teachers to participate it, against their will. Nor can they make the willingness to participate in, or lead, collective worship a condition of teachers' employment. If necessary, head teachers are required to source \\"appropriate people from the local community who would be willing and able to lead collective worship\\". == Compliance with, and Challenges to, the Law on Collective Worship == When the head of Ofsted announced that it would no longer inspect the provision of Collective Worship in 2004, he stated that 76% of secondary schools were not compliant with the law. An opinion poll commissioned by the BBC in 2011 indicated that 64% of parents in England say their children do not attend a daily act of worship at school, and that 60% of the general public are not in favour of the law on collective worship being enforced. In 2011, amendments were proposed to the law on collective worship, which would have made it optional at schools without a formal faith designation, and which would have also made it easier for pupils to opt themselves out of collective worship. The amendments were debated in the House of Lords, but were not adopted. Nigel Genders, the Church of England's Chief Education Officer stated that: Philosopher James K. A. Smith holds that daily collective worship imparts what an educational institution values and has an impact on human formation; because the United Kingdom's national identity and ethics \\"are fundamentally rooted in Christianity\\", there is no reason why collective worship should be discontinued. Elizabeth Oldfield, the director of the Theos Think Tank, has opined that scrubbing religion from the public square is far from neutral. The Catholic Education Service teaches that: Groups campaigning to amend the law on Collective Worship include Humanists UK and the National Secular Society, who argue that the requirement for daily worship should be replaced by a requirement for inclusive assemblies instead. The National Governors Association is also seeking an end to compulsory collective worship in schools without a religious affiliation. In 2014 a leading education spokesperson for the Church of England, Bishop Pritchard, publicly expressed a view that the term collective worship should be re-framed as \\"spiritual reflection\\" to make it, in his eyes, \\"more honest, and more in tune with contemporary culture.\\" The Liberal Democrats have adopted a policy to make collective worship in non-religious schools optional rather than compulsory, and a change in the law has also been called for by the Arts and Humanities Research Council. In 2016, the Committee on the Rights of the Child called for an end to compulsory collective worship in UK schools. Christian nationalists see the call by some to remove collective worship in schools as \\"the next step in the ongoing erosion of our Christian heritage\\" and state that \\"Christian collective worship should stay because we are a Christian nation.\\" == History of the Law on Collective Worship == The law on compulsory collective worship was first introduced by Section 25 of the 1944 Education Act. The legislation was subsequently developed by the Education Reform Act 1988, by Chapter III of the Education Act 1996, and, most recently, by the School Standards and Framework Act 1998. == Collective Worship in other parts of the UK (Scotland and Northern Ireland) == Collective worship is also a daily legal requirement in Northern Ireland, although regulations on the nature of the worship are different to that of England and Wales. In Scotland there is no requirement for collective worship, but the practice of religious observance should be available to pupils, unless the local education authority has resolved to discontinue it and this resolution has been approved by local electors. ==References== == External links == *The Importance of Collective Worship at St Nicholas Category:Christianity and society in the United Kingdom Category:Education policy in the United Kingdom Category:Education in England Category:History of education in England ","title":"Collective worship in schools"},{"id":"56628895","text":"Shamsul Islam Khan (known as Naya Miah; died on 21 January 2006) was a Bangladesh Nationalist Party politician and a former Jatiya Sangsad member representing the Manikganj-4 constituency and a former minister of industries at the first Khaleda Zia cabinet. ==Career== Khan served as the president of Abahani Limited Dhaka from 1978 to 1982.

Risalder rose to prominence following the August 1991 killing of a Congress Party leader. In February 1993, Chief Minister Chimanbhai Patel was credited with strong-arming Risalder into an uneasy alliance to keep the peace between Hindu and Muslim communal activists in Baroda in the lead up to an election in which the BJP was expected to contest the traditional Congress Party dominance of elections in the region by issuing orders to have several of Risalder's lieutenants arrested. Risalder and Shiv Sena were then tasked with ensuring that the BJP turnout would be low. According to The Times of India, leaders of the Hindu community cooperated out of a desire to avert the communal rioting and destruction of shops and other property that were expected if Congress lost the election. Risalder's henchmen were accused of murdering of Dinesh Pathak, the resident editor of the popular Gujarati daily Sandesh.

The Razmnama, British Library Or.12076 is an incomplete illustrated Mughal manuscript of the Razmnama, which is a translation of the Hindu epic Mahabharata written by Naqib Khan, and copied in AH 1007 (1598/99). It contains sections 14–18, the concluding part of the work, with some detached parts. There are 24 full-page Mughal paintings of high quality, all attributed to artists (two artists in three cases). It is the second of the four surviving Mughal illustrated manuscripts,Seyller, 37 described in the BL catalogue as \\"Sub-imperial Mughal\\".

First Bhima and his army went to Bhadravati, the city of king Yuwanshwa and find a white horse ideal for the sacrifice. Bhima also went to Dwarka to invite Krishna, and also tell Anusalwa who tried to abduct the white horse but was defeated by Vrishakethu. The Jaimini version tells many adventures of white horse. First the horse reaches Malwa where Arjuna fights and defeats King Niladhwaja. Then the horse stuck in a rock in the Vindhya Range and the sage Saubhari tells the story of Chandi. Next the horse reaches the city of King Hansadhwaja. Arjuna with the help of Krishna kills Hansadhwaja's son Sudhanva and Suratha. Then the horse reaches Manipura where Arjuna's son Babruvahana kills Arjuna. Here Jaimini tells the story of Rama who fights with his own son Lava-kusha. But later Arjuna is save by a magical gem. Next the horse reaches the city of Tamaradhvaja but Krishna manage to defeat them. Then horse come country of Viravarma, King of Saraswata but defeat with help of Krishna and Hanuman. When horse reached country Chandrahasa, sage Narada tell his story of Chandrahasa who adopt by king and married to Bikhaya also he sacrifice himself to save relatives and finally became king. Chandrahasa surrender himself to Krishna. Horse finally reached Hastinapur and yudhisthira completed his Sacrifice. Next Book, Ashramavasika Parva tell Dhitrashtra renounce to Hastinapur with Kunti and gandhari and went to live forest but soon died by Fire of forest. Last three books Mausala Parva, Mahaprasthanika Parva, Svargarohana Parva tell end of krishna and pandavas. ==Notes== ==References== *Audrey Truschke, Culture of Encounters: Sanskrit at the Mughal Court (Columbia University Press, 2016), (also her PhD thesis: Cosmopolitan Encounters: Sanskrit and Persian at the Mughal Court.

The castle was built by the ruler Javanshir during the reign of Mehranids dynasty in the Caucasus Albania. The fortress is named after him. It is believed that the fortress was used as an administrative center. ==Structure== The fortress was constructed of lime and river stones. The area of the fortress is about 1.5 – 2 hectares. It consists of fortress and an inner fortress called Naringala. It is surrounded by valley of the Agchay river from three sides. The complex consists of the main part and Ichgala. The polygonal shaped Ichgala was built on the highest point of the mountain. In most places only basis of it remains. The walls of the Ichgala are demolished. Thickness of the southern wall of the main portion is 2 meters and its height is more than 10 meters. The western walls were completely destroyed by landslides. The defense complex includes 6 towers and their height are up to 8 meters. At the northern end of the tower there is a wall with a width of 2 meters and a ledge length of 50 meters. The wall is completed with a cylinder-shaped tower. The entrance to the castle was only from the southern side. There was a gate place with 2.5 m width. There were comb-shaped merlons about 0.5 m from each other on top of the walls. Tower was built to strengthen walls of the castle. Ichgala is in the northern part of the fortress. Towers are four-cornered on the south, and rounded on other sides. Some of their diameters reach 8 meters. The main surveillance point is located at the northern end of the fortress. There used to be a hidden path on the north-eastern side of the fortress. This gave opportunity to the fortress to communicate with outside during a blockade.

The feature-length film was released in January 2018 in the World Cinema Documentary section at the Sundance Film Festival. At the center of the film is the woolly mammoth, an extinct and iconic species that today is surrounded by wishes and visions. On the one hand, the film documents the hazardous daily lives of a group of men who gather valuable mammoth tusks in a remote archipelago, the New Siberian Islands. On the other, it illuminates the potential of genetic research and synthetic biology — the means by which researchers hope to bring the woolly mammoth back to life. == Synopsis == BGI Human Genome Center (film still). Year after year, the mammoth hunters set out on a dangerous journey to the remote New Siberian Islands in the far north of Siberia. They dig into the earth in search of the tusks of extinct mammoths — precious ivory that they can sell for huge sums of money. Because the permafrost is thawing, entire mammoth carcasses are also coming to light, and scientists are showing great interest in these finds. Cloning researchers and molecular biologists are working with a variety of methods to achieve their goal of bringing the woolly mammoth back to life. The film takes us from the archaic landscape of the New Siberian Islands to a mammoth museum in Yakutsk, a meeting of young scientists in Boston, the International Genetically Engineered Machine competition, to a commercial cloning company in South Korea, and to gene data bank in Shenzhen, China. == Themes == The film’s Russian co-director, Maxim Abugaev, accompanied and filmed the Siberian mammoth tusk collectors during one hunting season. \\"(These) hunters are the native people of the North, who practice shamanism and believe in spirits of nature,\\"Deadline.com, January 9, 2018. says Abugaev. \\"They are very careful and superstitious in their approach to these uninhabited islands. We see the Arctic as a living creature of its own with mighty incomprehensible powers.\\" \\"Genesis 2.0 deals with legends, myths and taboos and confronts us with our own fear of an unknown future,\\" adds Frei. In this situation, researchers such as George Church, Professor of Genetics at Harvard University see the potential of the science: \\"Synthetic biology is very likely to be the next big revolution. (...) Humans are very bold and they have vision. And they will follow that sometimes to their death.\\"Transcript from the movie, minute 26.See article MIT Technology Review, February 16, 2018. Dr. Huanming Yang from the BGI Human Genome Center in ShenzhenNatureGenetics, Nature.com, January 15, 2012. sums up the future- oriented research shown in the film as follows: \\"We proposed the first project to sequence everything in the world. (...) God’s word is still imperfect. But if we work together we can make God perfect. The book of life is written with the same language. All the secrets are in this double helix.\\"Transcript from the movie, minute 32. In this project, life becomes data. == Protagonists == The professional mammoth hunter Peter Grigoriev and the unemployed stoker Spira Sleptsov share a desire to ultimately discover a spectacular mammoth tusk. Ivory, or \\"white gold\\", can be sold in China for high pricesScience and Film, January 31, 2018. — and in order to reach this goal, the hunters are risking a great deal. They are torn between two driving forces: the promise of a great discovery and their spiritual belief that it is forbidden to disturb the mammoths’ remains.The Hollywood Reporter, January 21, 2018. Peter Grigoriev’s brother, the paleontologist Semyon Grigoriev, is the director of the mammoth museum in Yakutsk. His goal is to one day be able to create a clone of a woolly mammoth.National Public Radio online, May 31, 2013. In order to realize this ambition he travels to South Korea, together with his wife, Lena Grigorieva, to visit the biotech company named Sooam, lead by Hwang Woo- suk. In 2005, Hwang made headlines because his stem cell research was deemed as fraud; today he is the director of a successful commercial company that specializes in cloning dogs. The woolly mammoth is an object of interest not only for cloning researchers but also for molecular biologists and geneticists. One of them is George Church, a Harvard professor of geneticsScience and Film, January 31, 2018. who uses state-of-the-art technological methods for his research in synthetic biology. He is currently working on \\"editing\\" an elephant similar to a mammoth — a \\"mammophant\\".The Guardian, February 16, 2017. == Release == The film premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in January 2018 and was awarded with the World Cinema Documentary Special Jury Award for Cinematography. Swiss cameraman Peter Intergand and Russian filmmaker Maxim Arbugaev were responsible for the cinematography; Arbugaev also co-directed the film. ==Reception== === Critical response === On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 77%, based on 13 reviews. Similar review aggregator Metacritic calculated a score of 60 based on 5 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". In The Hollywood Reporter, Sheri Linden writes that the film is a real-life thriller structured like a double helix, simultaneously frightening and unforgettable: “At the center of the heady mix is the woolly mammoth, a long-extinct species that key figures in the exquisitely crafted documentary are determined to revive. Those figures speak, without irony or warning, of the power to design bodies and perfect God's work.” She continues: “With elegance and poignancy, the score by Max Richter and Edward Artemyev sounds its own alarms, a stirring match for the striking camerawork by a number of cinematographers. And through the divergent paths of two Yakutian brothers, the film throws into question the simplistic notion of mercenary selfishness versus the purity of science.” Wendy Idy from Screendaily finds the beginning of the film esoteric, as it opens with a female voice intoning a passage from a Yakutian epic tale.Screendaily.com, January 21, 2018. In her review, Idy emphasizes the significance of the film’s basic message: “The overarching theme is humanity’s reckless courage — as such, it’s a picture which finds its closest parallels in the films of Werner Herzog.” === Accolades === Awards * Sundance Film Festival 2018: World Cinema Special Jury Award for Cinematography to Maxim Arbugaev und Peter Indergand * 40th Moscow International Film Festival 2018: Audience Award * 15th Seoul Eco Film Festival 2018: Beste Feature Film *CinemAmbiente Turin 2018: Best International Documentary * Green Film Network 2018: Best Documentary * Lunenburg Doc Fest 2018: Feature Documentary Award * International Arctic Film Festival Golden Raven 2018: Golden Raven Award * 9th DocUtah International Film Festival 2018: Best Foreign Film * Zürcher Filmpreis 2018: Film Award City of Zurich * Budapest International Documentary Film Festival 2019: Main Prize section Naked Truth * Detour Cinema del Viaggio Film Festival 2019: Best Film Nominations * Sundance Film Festival 2018: Nomination Jury Prize World Cinema Documentary Competition (Christian Frei and Maxim Arbugaev) * Swiss Film Award 2019: Nomination Best Documentary Film == References == == External links == * * Category:2018 documentary films Category:2018 films Category:Swiss films Category:Swiss documentary films Category:Documentary films about prehistoric life Category:Films directed by Christian Frei ","title":"Genesis 2.0"},{"id":"56629339","text":"Wangolepis sinensis is a nomen nudumJanvier, Philippe, et al. \\"Devonian fish (Placodermi, Antiarcha) from Tra Ban Island (Bai Tu Long Bay, Quang Ninh Province, Vietnam) and the question of the age of the Dô Son Formation.\\" Journal of Asian Earth Sciences 21.7 (2003): 795-801. referring to as yet formally undescribed, primarily Early Silurian-aged fossils of what are agreed to be of a primitive placoderm. ==References== Category:Placoderms of Asia Category:Nomina nuda ","title":"Wangolepis"},{"id":"56629353","text":"Degenerates is an Australian rock band formed by Jamie Durrant (guitar, vocals), Julien Chick (bass) and David Klenjans (drums).

Built in 1884, the windmill was initially planned to be built as a smock mill. After the structure collapsed soon after completion, the mill was rebuilt to the current \\"beltmolen\\" type, with a pile of sand put around the mill allowing it to be built higher. Vincent van Gogh, who lived in Nuenen from 1883 to 1885, painted and drew De Roosdonck a total of 7 times. The most famous painting in his Nuenen period, The Potato Eaters, was painted in the neighbouring cottage. The windmill was built by Antonius van Himbergen from nearby Bladel, who has also built the Annemie windmill in Acht, and other similar type windmills in the area. From 1887 to 1930 the windmill was also used as an oil mill, with the machinery bought from the miller of Sint Victor in Heeze. Due to industrialisation and the introduction of other sources of energy, professional production of flower stopped in 1959. The mill deteriorated. After purchase by the local government in 1970, the windmill was restored in 1972, with further restorations in 1984 and 1996.

It is called karoo satynblom in Afrikaans. == Description == Romulea monadelpha is a low geophyte of high, with a subterranean stem that grows from a corm with a rounded base, which has a tunic with curved acuminate teeth. Its three to five thread-like leaves grow directly out of the soil and are in diameter, and have four grooves along their lengths. Its flowers sit individually at the tip of a flower stalk (or pedicel) and are subtended by two bracts that both mostly have brown papery margins. The outer bract usually has one keel on the upper side and a narrow papery margin, the inner bract has two keels with a wider papery margin. The trimerous flowers are without scent, burgundy red with elaborately colored blotches with black and cream in the cup, but the population around the Gannaga Pass population has salmon colored flowers and large black and light grey markings. The six tepals are oval and may be slightly indented at the tip, 2½–4 cm (1–1.6 in) long. The three filaments are oblong in shape and are firmly pressed together or even fused to form a column of long, mostly without hairs and topped by 1–1½ cm long anthers. When the fruit is ripe, the flower stalk is curved.

These units were made up from temporary elements (or ‘modules’) from a variety of units and would be deployed in company patrol bases along the border. 53 Battalion for example would have companies from 1 SAI, the Cape Town Highlanders, Rand Light Infantry and 6 SAI allocated to it for a particular season, while 54 Battalion would source it's infantry elements from 8 SAI and the SACC. http://www.historicalpapers.wits.ac.za/inventories/inv_pdfo/A3079/A3079-F3-001-jpeg.pdf There was usually a company of SWATF attached to each Modular Battalion on rotation to provide ‘local knowledge’ and various elements of 1 SWA Specialist Unit were also attached to provide tracking and patrolling expertise. Koevoet or Romeo-Mike teams were also frequently stationed in these company bases for mutual protection, but would generally operate independently. The Modular Battalions’ heavy weapons often included a wide variety of captured Soviet and obsolete British World War II-era items, which were usually static, being primarily intended for base defence. Motor transport was limited, with a few Buffels being retained for patrolling and SAAF helicopters often being utilised for inter-base liaison. The companies of a Modular Battalion were generally weak during the quiet dry season (maybe 30- 50% strength), but would each be brought up to the full strength of five platoons in time for the wet season, which was when the bush would become jungle and SWAPO-PLAN infiltration teams would stream southwards. Their main responsibility was to secure their assigned area in which they conducted cordon and search operations, patrols, checkpoints, mine sweeping and the protection of roads and water systems. * Five ‘Modular’ Infantry Battalions ** 51 Battalion at Ruacana, 51 Battalion ** 52 Battalion at Oshakati, 52 Battalion emblem ** 53 Battalion at Ondangwa, 53 Battalion emblem ** 54 Battalion at Eenhana 54 Battalion and ** 55 Battalion at Nepara. 55 Battalion ===Insignia of South West Africa Command 1980s=== ====SWA Command Headquarters insignia==== South West Africa Command insignia ====SWA Command Units insignia==== ====SWA Command Sector Units insignia==== == Leadership == * 1966 Colonel Magnus Malan * 1979 Colonel Johannes Geldenhuys ==References== Category:Commands of the South African Army Category:Military units and formations disestablished in 1988 Category:1939 establishments in South Africa Category:Military units and formations established in 1939 Category:1988 disestablishments in South Africa ","title":"South West Africa Command"},{"id":"56630013","text":"Sanesi is an Italian surname.

BSEC gained international legal identity when it was transformed into a full-fledged organization - the Organization of the Black Sea Economic Cooperation on May 1, 1999 after its Charter entered into force. The Organization has 12 member states (Albania, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Bulgaria, Georgia, Greece, Moldova, Romania, Russia, Serbia, Turkey, and Ukraine) cooperating on various areas like agriculture, finance, education, culture, tourism, trade, transport, energy, and healthcare. Council of Ministers of Foreign Affairs is the main decision- making organ. The Heads of the member countries meet generally every 5 years in the Summit Meetings. == History of relations == Azerbaijan is one of the founding members of the OBSEC and since 25 June 1992. Azerbaijan collaborates on trade, customs, transport, energy, environment, information and communications, science and technology issues based on mutual interests with the member states. Due to the ongoing conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh region, Azerbaijan started to actively participate in the work of OBSEC after ceasefire was declared. The President of Azerbaijan attended in the Summit of OBSEC on 25 October 1996 for the first time and signed Moscow Declaration.

During the period of 1992-2003, relations between OBSEC and Azerbaijan were more advisory, but since 2003 the relations have been characterized by the development of cooperation in specific areas. The relations with OBSEC are developing at a low pace because conflicts between member states (Azerbaijan- Armenia, Russia-Georgia, Greece-Turkey) and economic crisis have weakened inter-institutional integration processes. President Ilham Aliyev accepted General Secretary of OBSEC Valeri Chechelashvili in November 2003, ministers of education of member states in April 2004, Secretary General Tedo Japaridze in February 2006, Leonidas Chrysanthopoulos in June 2006.

Cavan. The field in which one army pitched their campaign is now called Cnocán na gCampa which means 'The little hill of the campus'. It is a pretty field with grass much greener than that in the neighbouring fields. Beside it, is the field where the battle was fought. It is a grey field covered with large stones which are said to be monuments to the men who fell in the battle and are buried under them. It is said that if the field was dug up, the bones of the dead would be found in it. A stream runs by the battle fields, and touches it on the two sides. The stream is almost choked up by big stones, and there are two stones among them, with old Irish writing on them. This is all the information that is available about the battle in this district. It is not known exactly what tribes had the battle, but it is known that it took place thousands of years ago. The fields are along the main road from Swanlinbar to Ballinamore.Local Place Names If the accounts of the battle are correct then the name on the 1813 map Derryhaunis could be the Irish Doire hAmhnais meaning 'The Oakwood of Combat'. ==References== ==External links== *The IreAtlas Townland Data Base Category:Townlands of County Cavan ","title":"Derryconnessy"},{"id":"56630228","text":"The women's 15 kilometre mass start freestyle at the 2017 Asian Winter Games was held on 26 February 2017 at the Shirahatayama Open Stadium in Sapporo, Japan. ==Schedule== All times are Japan Standard Time (UTC+09:00) {class = \\"\\" style=\\"text-align:center;\\" ! width=220Date ! width=50Time ! width=100Event -  Sunday, 26 February 2017  10:00  bgcolor=ffffccFinal } ==Results== ;Legend *DNS — Did not start { class= style=\\"text- align:center\\" !width=40Rank !width=250Athlete !width=80Time -  align=left 43:28.6 -  align=left 43:32.5 -  align=left 43:33.8 - 4 align=left 43:38.5 - 5 align=left 43:44.1 - 6 align=left 44:18.2 - 7 align=left 44:40.2 - 8 align=left 45:17.7 - 9 align=left 45:37.7 - 10 align=left 45:45.4 - 11 align=left 46:17.7 - 12 align=left 46:38.2 - 13 align=left 47:11.8 - 14 align=left 47:17.0 - 15 align=left 48:09.6 - 16 align=left 48:12.6 - 17 align=left 50:35.0 - 18 align=left 51:35.8 - 19 align=left 53:33.1 - 20 align=left 59:10.9 - — align=left DNS - — align=left DNS - — align=left DNS - — align=left DNS } ==References== ==External links== *Results at FIS website Women 15 ","title":"Cross-country skiing at the 2017 Asian Winter Games – Women's 15 kilometre freestyle"},{"id":"56630262","text":"John Camacho Salas (January 1948 – January 26, 2018) was a Guamanian educator, academic administrator, and politician.

They were: * E 3001 from Thomson and General Electric * E 3101 from AEG and Henschel * E 3201 from Westinghouse, later SNCF 1C1 3900 * E 3301 from Brown- Boveri and SLM Winterthur * E 3401 from Ateliers du Nord et de l'Est * E 3501 from Schneider Only the E 3201 really worked well.

In 2003, a survey by Nielsen Media Research showed a monthly readership comparable to Rip It Up, New Zealand's leading music magazine.

The 196th and final issue of Real Groove, dated October 2010, featured Leonard Cohen on the cover. The magazine had tried to focus on its online presence and, according to Wicks, the closure was due to \\"the lack of demand for physical publications\\".

The agricultural expansion is often explained as a direct consequence of the global increase in food and energy requirements due to the human overpopulation (which in turn has been attributed to agricultural expansion itself), with an estimated expectation of 10 to 11 billion humans on Earth by end of this century. It is foreseen that most of the world's non-agrarian ecosystems (terrestrial and aquatic) will be affected adversely, from habitat loss, land degradation, overexploitation, and other problems. The intensified food (and biofuel) production will in particular affect the tropical regions. Most modern agriculture relies on intensive methods. Further expansion of the predominant farming types that rest on a small number of highly productive crops has led to a significant loss of biodiversity on a global scale already. In the light of the already occurring and potential massive ecological effects, the need for sustainable practices is more urgent than ever. The FAO predicts that global arable land use will continue to grow from a in 2014 to in 2050, with most of this growth projected to result from developing countries. At the same time, arable land use in developed countries is likely to continue its decline. A well-known example of already ongoing agricultural expansion is the proliferation of palm oil production areas or the land conversion/deforestation for soy bean production in South America. Today's land grabbing activities are often a consequence of the strive for agricultural land by growing economies. In the beginning of the 21 century the palm oil industry caused a massive deforestation in Borneo with a heavy consequences. ==See also== *Industrial agriculture *Green revolution *Environmental impact of agriculture *Meat consumption *Overexploitation *Biodiversity loss *Carbon sink *Deforestation *Land sparing *Species extinctions *Jevons paradox *Social and environmental impact of palm oil ==References== ==Sources== * * * ==External links== * Category:Agriculture ","title":"Agricultural expansion"},{"id":"56630577","text":"The Chinese Kiosk, Woodside, Old Windsor. Thomas Robins the Elder, 1750s. Private collection. Woodside is a large detached house with 37 acres of gardens in Old Windsor, Berkshire, on the edge of Windsor Great Park. The house has been rebuilt several times since the 18th century. The Rococo gardens of Woodside were laid out in the mid-18th century and depicted by the artist Thomas Robins the Elder. The gardens were subsequently redesigned under Rosemary Verey and Roy Strong in the 1980s and 1990s. Woodside has been the home of the musician Sir Elton John since 1975. ==History== Woodside (centre) on an 1870 Ordnance Survey map Woodside was originally built in the 1500s for Henry VIII's surgeon, the site chosen so that the occupant could be summoned by an emergency flag flown at Windsor Castle. The house subsequently burnt down and has been rebuilt three times, most recently in 1947 in a style described as \\"post war mock Georgian\\". At the time of Woodside's 1989 refurbishment the house consisted of eight bedrooms, five reception rooms, a billiard room, and a squash court in 37 acres of grounds. ===18th century=== In 1752 Hugh Hammersley acquired Woodside upon his marriage to Ann Clark. By 1755 Hammersley had rebuilt the house in the fashionable Gothic revival style and laid out extensive plantings of shrubberies and flower gardens around the property. Hammersley's Rococo gardens at Woodside were captured in three paintings by Thomas Robins the Elder, including a 'Chinese kiosk', an early example of chinoiserie which was inspired by the Chinese Pavilion at Kew Gardens. Robins's paintings are the only evidence for the composition of Woodside's gardens in the 18th century. A broadside ballad of the 1750s in the English Broadside Ballad Archive collated by the University of California, Santa Barbara recounts the tale of a 'human monster' who resided at Woodside who had been \\"noted for the infamous feat of eating a cat alive\\" and that he had been \\"apprehended and committed to goal, on a charge of murdering an infant six years old\\". ===19th century=== Woodside was the home of John Ramsbottom (1778–1845), Member of Parliament for New Windsor between 1810 and 1845. The 1828 Visitants' guide to Windsor castle and its vicinity described Woodside as \\"having a very commanding appearance\\", surrounded by a \\"handsome park\\", and noted that it was \\"situated on the gentle declivity of a hill stretching from the Great Park to the Thames\\". According to the guide, the house was built during the reign of King George II. Woodside was advertised for sale in The Times in July 1849 through Messrs Daniel Smith and Sons. The advertisement described a \\"substantial mansion of the Elizabethan style of architecture\\" situated in a small park \\"studded with venerable old oaks and other valuable timber\\". The estate was listed at 122 acres including a small farm, \\"walled gardens, beautiful pleasure rounds, a conservatory, an ornamental cottage residence and farmhouse buildings\\". It was purchased at that time by the merchant William Devas, and was therefore the childhood home of the political economist Charles Stanton Devas.Devas, Francis Charles. \\"Charles Stanton Devas.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 4. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1908. 6 March 2019 ===20th century=== Colonel William Webb Follett died at Woodside in April 1926. His widow, Lady Julia Alice Kennedy, daughter of The 2nd Marquess of Ailsa, lived on at the house until her death in December 1936. A fire at the house in April 1928 considerably damaged woodwork and paneling dating back to the time of James II, and a 'large and historic old fireplace' had to be demolished to make way for the fire services. A wooden beam that had been 'smouldering for weeks' was believed to be the cause. Lady Julia's obituary in The Times wrote of her that \\"She never used a telephone or drove in a car, and her house, the largest in the village, was lit with oil lamps\\". ==Elton John== Since 1975 the house has been the principal residence of the English musician and composer Sir Elton John. John also owns an apartment in Atlanta, Georgia, a villa near Nice on the French Cote d'Azur and a house in London's Holland Park district. John bought the house for £400,000 in 1974 (£ at current prices) and subsequently brought in his collections of what the music writer Mick Brown described as 'High Rock'n'Roll Empire', including \\"jukeboxes and pinball machines; Tiffany lamps and art deco nymphs; red leather sofas; the odd Rembrandt etching; a disco; [and] a replica of Tutankhamun's state throne\\". The house also stored John's many costumes from his tours and the 4 ft-high Doc Marten boots that he wore in the 1975 film Tommy. The contents of the house were subsequently sold at auction for $8.2 million at a 2,000-item four-day sale at Sotheby's in September 1988. John decided to refurbish and redesign Woodside after overcoming drink and drug addictions in the late 1980s, feeling that he \\"didn't want to be a middle-aged man who was a parody of his younger self\\" and that the house contained \\"a lot of kitsch ...it was more of an Aladdin's cave than a home.\\" The subsequent redesign and refurbishment of the house was begun in 1989 and took three years. It was carried out by Adrian Cooper-Grigg and Andrew Protheroe, with the proviso that they should attempt to create an English country house that resembled the seat of a well established family with their objects accumulated over successive generations. Protheroe said that John \\"wanted it to look like something that had evolved ...something that had happened instead of being contrived\\"; the pair consequently acquired many antiques and objets d'art. Brown described the interior decoration on his 2010 visit as consisting of \\"capacious sofas – an aura of Aubusson, cut moquette, damask – and deep carpets. There are vases spilling with flowers, elaborately carved tables, every surface covered with exquisite porcelain.\\" The restrictions on building materials after the Second World War meant that Woodside's ceilings are comparatively low at only 8 ft 6in, and to increase the perceived height of the rooms Cooper-Grigg and Protheroe added columns and mouldings and allowed draperies to pool on the floor. The indoor swimming pool was redesigned to resemble an ancient Roman bath and the front entrance was designed to highlight the enfilade that centres on a gazebo and waterfall in the gardens. A shell room was created with conches and cockle shells over a four-month period. An 18th-century orangery at the end of the drive was restored in the late 1990s. Viscount Linley designed a marquetry screen that surrounds the bed in the master bedroom, and a chest of drawers in which some of John's collection of hundreds of spectacles are kept. John's archive of 70,000 CDs is housed next to the gym. Woodside is the site of The White Tie and Tiara Ball, an annual charitable ball held to raise money for the Elton John AIDS Foundation. ==Art== The main house is hung with mainly 18th- and 19th-century paintings, including works by Helen Allingham, Arthur Devis, Thomas Gainsborough, Henry Scott Tuke, and watercolours by Edward Lear. A former garage block situated at the rear of the main house has been redesigned as a purpose-built art gallery; it stands between the main house and Woodside's tennis court. It was designed by the architect Jack Schneider and was completed in 2009. One wall of the gallery is clad in copper, with another featuring a running waterfall. The mezzanine level of the gallery is home to a large library of art books. The writer Mick Brown described entering the gallery as \\"like stepping into an adjunct\\" of the Tate Modern. The gallery contains a large tapestry of John by Chuck Close given as a present by Close for John's 60th birthday, as well as pieces by Louise Bourgeois, Jake and Dinos Chapman, Gilbert and George, Antony Gormley, Andreas Gursky, Damien Hirst, Philip Taaffe, and a self-portrait by Gillian Wearing. ==Gardens== The drive and main entrance of Woodside in 2007 The present gardens at Woodside were laid out in the late 1980s by the garden designers Gordon Taylor and Guy Cooper under the direction of Rosemary Verey. Verey's biographer, Barbara Paul Robinson, felt that working for John with his large annual expenditure on Woodside was a welcome change for her since she had become used to clients who complained about costs. After being contacted by John's personal assistant in 1987, Verey recalled the name 'Woodside' from Robins's 18th-century paintings of the Rococo garden, and found a limited edition of a book featuring the paintings, which she presented to John. Verey was asked for a detailed garden plan for Woodside at short notice in 1988, and enlisted the help of Taylor and Cooper as she had no garden staff of her own. She described herself as an 'advisor' on the garden project, which involved detailed minuted meetings with landscape designers, architects and full-time gardeners. A water garden at Woodside with spouting fountains, large 'overflowing' flowering pots and scented borders was inspired by the Generalife gardens of the Alhambra in Granada. Verey claimed credit for its creation against the wishes of other gardeners; it is not clear who is responsible for its creation. Verey initially planted and helped develop a white garden, a rainbow border (nicknamed the Ribbon Borders) inspired by Gertrude Jekyll, a scented garden, and an 18th-century garden at Woodside. The drive toward the main entrance of the house is lined with white rose bushes. Verey's white garden at Woodside was inspired by the white garden at the Sissinghurst Castle Garden, designed by Vita Sackville-West. Verey toured the gardens of Woodside in her BBC documentary The English Country Garden, broadcast in October 1996. The art historian and garden designer Sir Roy Strong created a classical Italian garden for John, at the behest of John's friend the fashion designer Gianni Versace. Strong had previously created gardens for Versace at his homes in Lake Como and Florida, the Villa Fontanelle, and the Casa Casuarina, respectively. The creation of Strong's Italian garden of scarlet geraniums and boxwood necessitated the moving of Verey's white garden, which upset her. Verey complained to friends saying that if John had wanted an Italian garden, \\"then why didn't he buy a house in Italy?!\\" and wrote that \\"Sadly (for me), Elton decided he wanted an Italian garden so after six years my white garden has gone and statues and vistas have taken over. I wonder, does an Italian garden blend with and complement an English Regency house?\\". John's head gardener, Helen Finch, maintained the gardens. Verey later attended John's 50th birthday at Woodside dressed as the rainbow border. Various follies are scattered in the garden, including a red telephone kiosk and a red post box. In the woodland, a life-size fiberglass Tyrannosaurus named Daisy has eyes which light up when people pass by. Daisy was moved into the woodland by helicopter when the gardens were redesigned; she was a present to John from Ringo Starr (other sources say George Harrison or Paul McCartney). A folly in the garden resembling nearby Windsor Castle was constructed as a stable for John's donkeys and pony during the late 1980s renovations. The gardens are also home to a former W2-class Melbourne tram (No. 520) which John imported from Australia in the 1980s in what he described as one of \\"my drug-induced moments\\", stating in a 2010 interview that the tram cost \\"Ten thousand to buy it. And a million to ship it over\\". The gardens of Woodside also contain an organic vegetable garden; one of John's pumpkins from the garden won third prize at a horticultural show. In 1997 the garden was maintained by a head gardener and five full-time gardeners. The gardens were the subject of the 1997 book Elton John's Flower Fantasies: An Intimate Tour of his House and Garden by Caroline Cass. ==References== * ==External links== Category:Elton John Category:Gardens by Rosemary Verey Category:Gardens by Roy Strong Category:Gardens in Berkshire Category:Houses completed in 1947 Category:Houses in Berkshire Category:Old Windsor Category:Queen Anne Revival architecture in the United Kingdom ","title":"Woodside, Old Windsor"},{"id":"56630580","text":"Xocia's Dance is the thirteenth studio album by American hard bop tenor saxophonist Harold Land as band leader.

She was also one of the founders of the Faroese Women's Association (Kvinnufelagið), frequently serving as its chair. ==Biography== Born on 11 July 1909 in Kirkja on the easterly island of Fugloy, Malene Sofie Poulsen was the daughter of the fisherman Petur Pauli Poulsen (1881–1957) and his wife Susanne Elisabeth Zachariasen (1885–1919). One of seven children, after her mother died when she was eight, she was brought up by her maternal grandparents. Her grandfather, Símun Mikkjal Zachariasen, was a poet, politician and schoolteacher who played an active part in Faroese cultural life. When she was 16, Poulsen moved to Tórshavn where she took care of the house where her uncle and brother lived while attending college. A couple of years later, she went to Copenhagen where she worked as a housemaid. When she was 35 she married a Danish sailor, Carl Niklas Samuelsen, and set up house in Tórshavn. They had two children together. Like many of her compatriots, she was often left alone when her husband was away at sea. In 1952, Samuelsen was one of those who founded the Faroese women's association Kvinnufelagið í Havn. She was a board member for many years, sometimes the association's chair. She supported the association's goals of improving the political, economic and cultural roles of women. As the political parties showed little interest in having women members, the association set its own agenda, successfully having several women elected to the Tórshavn city council in 1956. Samuelsen, representing the Sjálvstýrisflokkurin party, was among them. She served on a number of committees involved in social services and education, and was re- elected in 1960. In 1964, acting for a short period as a substitute, she became the first woman to sit in the Faroese parliament. It was not until 1978 that the first women, Jona Henriksen and Karin Kjølbro, were officially elected to the Løgting. In 1965, Samuelsen was appointed head of the Tórshavn old peoples home where she remained for 13 years. She died in Tórshavn on 29 November 1997. ==References== Category:1909 births Category:1997 deaths Category:Faroese women in politics Category:Members of the Løgting Category:Faroese feminists Category:Faroese politicians ","title":"Malla Samuelsen"},{"id":"56630628","text":"Matamata, Mata-Mata or mata mata may refer to: * Matamata, New Zealand (disambiguation), town and other related names in Waikato, New Zealand * Mata- Mata, Brunei, populated place in Brunei-Muara District, Brunei * Mata mata, freshwater turtle ","title":"Matamata (disambiguation)"},{"id":"56630636","text":"Uzbekistan Professional Football League (Uzbek: O'zbekiston professional futbol ligasi / Ўзбекистон профессионал футбол лигаси; Russian: Профессиональная футбольная лига Узбекистана) — is an Uzbekistani sports football organization, founded in 2008.

With no one believing her, she must search for a solution. ==Cast== *Alexz Johnson as Grace *Gray O'Brien as Ilyas *Lauren McQueen as Sophie *Shelagh McLeod as Valerie *Peter Sacco as Dr. Barlas *Brendan Flynn as Kai *Anna Treasure as Virginia *Sean Saunders Stevenson as Liam *Jacqueline McMillan as Dr. Hiddleston *Catriona McDonald as Philippa ==Production== Writer-director Saunders said that her inspiration came while writing for the documentary series Ghostly Encounters, when she met an anorexic young woman whom nobody believed was visited nightly by a ghost. The woman's story became the television episode, \\"Anorexia and the Haunting Hag,\\" and, intrigued by the relationship between eating disorders and the supernatural, Saunders wrote The Wasting \\"with input from several people suffering anorexia.\\" Initially, the filmmakers attempted to fund the movie through the Canadian Film Centre's CFC Features program, which would have required filming in Canada. When Canadian Film Centre funding was unavailable, production was moved to Upton-upon-Severn in Worcestershire, U.K., to benefit from the UK Film Tax Relief program and the availability of experienced crew and actors. During early development of the film, Saunders approached her friend Alexz Johnson to participate as actor, musician, and co-producer. Saunders described the movie as a \\"family affair,\\" as her sons, Brendan Flynn and Sean Stevenson appear in the cast as brothers. ==Release== The Wasting premiered to excellent reviews at the 2017 Borrego Springs Film Festival in Borrego Springs, California. The film won the Best Horror award at the 2017 Austrian Independent Film Festival, and was an official selection at the Carmarthen Bay Film Festival, the Madeira Film Festival, and the Nevada Women's Film Festival. At the Vittorio Veneto film festival, The Wasting won the Monte Pizzoc and Monte Visentin awards, voted by more than 1000 young adults in the audience. North American rights to distribute The Wasting were acquired by IndieCan Entertainment in 2017. In 2018, the North American premiere of the film was took place in Toronto. The online release of the film for Canada and the United States took place in June 2018. ===Critical reception=== At its Borrego Springs Film Festival premiere, Steve Oldfield of FoxTV called The Wasting \\"a mind-bending visual feast\\" and said \\"director Carolyn Saunders' first feature shows she is a force to be reckoned with - a visual storyteller with a gift for creating suspense.\\" After a sold out premiere screening in Toronto, The Extra Mile said \\"Saunders has woven many visual and sound elements to create a compelling film that shines a light on perception and reality,\\" praising Lauren McQueen's \\"stellar performance\\" and the \\"poignant portrayals of Johnson, Flynn and Stevenson.\\" Leora Heilbronn in Brief Take said \\"there’s a hauntingly ghoulish subplot in there that’s reminiscent of a Gaskell or Poe story, but the film also tackles the all too prevalent acceptance of toxic masculinity and anorexia in a refreshingly original way.\\" Edmonton Movie Guide called it \\"a thoughtful, complex film\\" in which \\"the characters are well drawn and realistic, strongly portrayed by the young, highly watchable cast.\\" Other reviews were mixed, and mostly positive. ==References* Category:British films Category:2017 films Category:2017 horror films Category:British horror films Category:Canadian films Category:Canadian drama films Category:2010s ghost films ","title":"The Wasting"},{"id":"56630740","text":"Madonna and Child with Saints.

It was found in the Jiufotang Formation in Chaoyang, China, and was described by Wang et al., 2016. The name comes from the word Chongming, referring to a Chinese mythological bird, and the specific epithet is in honor of Mr. Xiaoting Zheng. ==Taxonomy== The species was first described in 2015; the description appeared in the pages of Scientific Reports. Only the holotype, extracted from the Jehol Biota sediments from the Early Cretaceous period in north-east China, was discovered. Chongmingia zhengi represents a developmental line unknown at the time of description, it illustrates the diversity of traits in contemporary birds. The furcula in C. zhengi was stiff, which indicates their poor performance and the need to use more force on the fly. On the other hand, the relatively long forelimb and well-developed chest and shoulder keel on the humerus may indicate that the bird was able to provide enough strength to rise into the air. The presence of gastroliths indicates the prevalence of herbivorous in early birds. Depending on the point of view, C. zhengi represents a previously unknown sister taxa to the Ornithothoraces clade, belonging to Avialae, or a sister taxon to a clade made up of all other Avialae except Archaeopteryx. The creators of the genus proposed two possible cladograms depicting kinship between C. zhengi and related taxa. The proposal that the new genus is a sister group for a clade made up of all the other avialans except Archaeopteryx is marked in green, while the competitive hypothesis for the Ornithothoraces sister group in its shown in blue. In the 2018 description of the basal pygostylian Jinguofortis, Chongmingia was recovered as a basal pygostylian sister to the former genus, and both genera placed in the new family Jinguofortisidae.Min Wang; Thomas A.

Retrieved from The Rance Series. It is the oldest continually-running erotic video-game series. The first installment, Rance – Hikari Quest –, was released in 1989, while the last main-series game, Rance X – Decisive Battle –, was released in 2018.ランス10  アリスソフト at the official AliceSoft web-site. The Rance series follows the titular character, Rance, as he saves a number of kingdoms, defeats demon invaders, and causes mischief in the in-game world, \\"The Continent.\\" He has appeared in most of the main series games as the playable character, accompanied by his loyal slave, Sill Plain. The main series has ten full games, with two Rance IV followups, while the Kichikuou Rance (Brutal King Rance) is an alternative-universe spin-off. In addition, the first three games, Rance – Hikari Quest –, Rance II – Rebellious Maidens –and Rance III – Fall of Leazas – have been retro-actively superseded by their later-released versions, Rance 01 – Hikari Quest –, Rance 02 – Rebellious Maidens – and Rance 03 – Fall of Leazas –. ==Games== ===Rance – Hikari Quest –=== Rance is given the task of finding and protecting the daughter of a rich family by Keith Gold, the owner of a local guild to which Rance is attached; he appears in almost all of the Rance series games. Rance investigates the city, while Sill investigates at Paris Academy, where the kidnapping victim attended school. The first game made by AliceSoft, it was released on the PC-8800 and PC-9800 series of computers, as well as the Sharp X68000, the MSX 2 and 2+, the FM TOWNS, and the PC88VA. A Windows 95–03 version of the game was released in the late 1990s, about eight years after the first game was released. ====Rance 01 – Hikari Quest –==== Rance 01 – Hikari Quest –, released for Windows in 2013, has the same setting as Rance – Hikari Quest –, and replaces the latter in the main canon. The game featured an improved gameplay system, and features more new content from Rance – Hikari Quest – comparatively to Rance 02 – Rebellious Maidens –, the re-release of Rance II – Rebellious Maidens –. ===Rance II – Rebellious Maidens –=== The city of Kathtom, a member of the Free Cities Alliance, is suddenly entombed under-ground by the Four Mages who were tasked to guard the town by Ragishss Cryhausen, the city's former guardian. Rance sets out with Sill to defeat them, but soon learns that their minds were corrupted by the power of the rings that they wield. Rance sets out to prevent them from receiving the magic power the rings grant. It was released on the same computer systems as the first Rance game was. ====Rance 02 – Rebellious Maidens –==== A graphical re- make of Rance II – Rebellious Maidens –, released for Windows in 2009. It was the genesis for the other early Rance series game re-releases. It did not contain as much new content as the next re-release, Rance 01 – Hikari Quest –. ===Rance III – Fall of Leazas –=== Leazas, a kingdom ruled by Queen Lia, who marries Rance in the Brutal King Rance time-line, is invaded by the warring empire of Helman, to the west. Demons are believed to be the cause of the attack, and to solve that problem, Rance sets out to find the \\"Chaos\\" sword, which contains the soul of an incredible thief from about one and one-half millennia ago. It was released on the PC-9800 series of computers, along with Sharp X68000 and the FM TOWNS; an early Windows release, similar to those that the first two Rance games received, was also released. ====Rance 03 – Fall of Leazas –==== A complete re-creation of Rance III – Fall of Leazas –, released for Windows in 2015. The graphics are renewed, while the story is changed to better fit into the main canon. It is the most advanced of the early Rance re- releases. ===Rance IV – Legacy of the Sect –=== This game directly follows the events of its predecessor. Rance, having defeated the demons of Helman and saved Leazas, is teleported to Ylapu, a giant floating island above Leazas. There, Rance must find a way to escape from the island, but is hindered by agents of Leazas and Helman who come to retrieve him to The Continent. The legacy alluded to by the game's title is a powerful magical artifact left by the Holy Magic Sect. It was released for the PC-9800 series and the FM TOWNS. ====Rance 4.1 ~ Saving Pharmaceutical ~==== Rance accepts a quest to stop a horde of under-ground monsters from attacking the Happiness Pharmaceutical building, where the Seirogan, a healing medicine, is produced. They discover that the perpetrators are the Angel Army; one of their commanders escapes, which begins the next game, Rance 4.2 ~ Angel Army ~. ====Rance 4.2 ~ Angel Army ~==== In a continuance of the previous game, Rance 4.1 ~ Saving Pharmaceutical ~, Rance chases down the remainder of the Angel Army, while himself being chased after by an assassination group and three \\"Rare Gal- Monsters,\\" a class of unique enemies that he offended in Rance IV – Legacy of the Sect –. The two games were released for the PC-9800 series, with a separate on-disc version. ===Brutal King Rance=== The game was assumed to be the final in the Rance series, and one of the final AliceSoft games; however, its great popularity allowed the company to continue its production of games. Rance, bored of his normal life, gathers a group of outlaw bandits and takes over some towns in southern Helman. The imperial army quickly puts down Rance's rebellion and take Sill captive; however, he escapes to Leazas, where he marries the country's queen to become a tyrant \\"brutal king,\\" commanding his own army to seek his revenge on Helman. Large opposition forces arise tried to remove the tyrant ruler from power; yet, Rance continues his trials to re-assert his power as the King of Leazas, retrieve Sill from Helman control, and take over the world. Rance, in fulfilling his general rôle as an epic hero, saves The Continent from destruction by a greater evil. It is the first territory acquisition-based Rance game, and was the genesis for other similarly-designed games. It was also the first AliceSoft game released for Windows, instead of any number of Japanese computer systems. All other Rance games to-date have been released for Windows. ===Rance 5D – Lonely Girl –=== The temporary stop in the production of Rance games, including the release of \\"Daiakuji\\" a year prior, led to the largest time-gap in-between the release of two Rance games. Rance 5D – Lonely Girl – is based on a unique roulette system, where the role-playing elements are determined by randomisation. In the game, Rance is travelling through The Continent, trying to recover the always-lacking money, when Rance and Sill accidentally enter Genbu Castle, a separate dimension. Rance et al. must then escape the dimension, with a newly- found woman, Rizna Lanfbitt of Zeth. ===Rance VI – Collapse of Zeth –=== Rance, continuing his trials from Rance 5D – Lonely Girl –, travels to Zeth, a kingdom to the south-west of Leazas. He offends Radon, a high governmental official, and is sent to the slave camp; Sill, who he bought from the Zeth slave camp, is treated very kindly. Whilst within the Zeth slave camp, Rance joins the resistance group \\"Ice Flame,\\" which seeks to change the un-equal governing system of Zeth, which is biased against non-magic users. Rance VI – Collapse of Zeth – is considered to be one of the best games in the Rance series, which is helped by the continuance of the game from the Brutal King Rance time-line. ===Warring-States Rance=== Rance sets out for JAPAN, an island archipelago to the east of The Continent, which is modeled after the Warring-States Period of Japanese history. The original English translation of this game, that of Yandere Translations, gave the Rance series, and AliceSoft in general, a noticeable presence in the western world. Warring-States Rance, also known by its title in Japanese, Sengoku Rance, was one of AliceSoft's best-selling titles of all time. In the game, Rance, having taken control of one of the feudal states, seeks to take over JAPAN through his control of the state, and save it from destruction. ===Rance Quest – Rance Quest –=== A continuation of the previous game, Warring-States Rance, wherein Rance returns to The Continent to seek a cure for the curse placed on Sill. While attempting to convince the Queen of Pencilcow, a kingdom to the west of Leazas, to cure Sill, he offends her, and she places a curse on him that he must become much stronger to overcome. He then journeys around The Continent, seeking a cure for himself and Sill. The game is based more upon the cessation of the stories of individual characters rather than a more continuous story-line. ====Rance Quest Magnum==== An expansion of Rance Quest – Rance Quest –, this game follows Rance as he quests around The Continent to break the curse incurred upon himself in the previous game. The game focuses on the addition of sundry quests, through which Rance can adventure, ostensibly to cure his curse, although primarily in practice to assuage the effects of the curse. ===Rance IX – Helman Revolution –=== The government of Helman has fallen into the hands of Stessel Ignon, who corrupts the country and plans to take over the entirety of The Continent. A revolutionary force gathers, seeking to replace the former emperor to the throne, and they solicit the aid of Rance, who agrees, hoping to remove Sill's curse. The Prime Minister, Stessel, has been planning this, and his actions have been seen earlier in the Rance series; he pushed for the war between Helman and Leazas in the events of Rance III – Fall of Leazas –. ===Rance X – Decisive Battle –=== The last game in the Rance series, it was released on 23 February 2018. The war amongst the demon lords of the Monster Realm has ended, and they now invade the human realm, to their east. Rance leads the combined forces of all humanity to battle the attacking demons.Green, S. (2017). After Almost 30 Years \\"Rance\\" Game Series Prepares For Final Battle.

The church is dedicated to the prophet Isaiah. ==History== Legend states that it originated in the 1st century, but the first documentary record of it dates to 1088, at which time it was outside the city walls. It became the centre of its district and by 1223 was a gathering-place for musters of soldiers. For a time at the end of the 14th century it housed Dominican nuns after the destruction of their monastery outside the walls - they later built and moved to the nearby San Mattia complex.

It lies in the Roman Catholic parish of Corlough and barony of Tullyhaw. ==Geography== Derrynacreeve is bounded on the north by Drumcanon (Kinawley) and Drumcar (Kinawley) townlands, on the south by Tawnagh townland, on the west by Derryvahan townland and on the east by Gortullaghan and Dunglave townlands. Its chief geographical features are the Owensallagh river (A source of the River Blackwater, County Cavan), a stream, forestry plantations and dug wells. Derrynacreeve is traversed by the R202 road (Ireland), the R200 road (Ireland), the N87 road (Ireland) and rural lanes. The townland covers 122 statute acres. ==History== In the Plantation of Ulster by grant dated 27 February 1610, along with other lands, King James VI and I granted one poll of Dirrenekrett to William O'Shereden, gentleman, Cheefe of his Name. William Sheridan was the chief of the Sheridan Clan in County Cavan. He was the son of the previous chief, Hugh Duff O'Sheridan of Togher townland, Kilmore parish, County Cavan. William was the ancestor of the famous Sheridan theatrical family. William died sometime before 1638 leaving two sons, Owen (of Mullaghmore, Tullyhunco) and Patrick (of Raleagh townland, Kildallan parish). Owen Sheridan succeeded to his father's lands. Owen's son Denis was born in 1612 and became a Catholic priest in charge of Kildrumferton parish, County Cavan. He later converted to Protestantism and on 10 June 1634 William Bedell, the Protestant Bishop of Kilmore, ordained him as a Minister of the Church of Ireland and two days later Denis was collated to the Vicarage of Killasser in the Diocese of Kilmore. Denis had several children, including William Sheridan (Bishop of Kilmore and Ardagh) 1682-1691 (his son Donald kept up the Templeport connection by marrying Mrs Enery of Bawnboy); Patrick Sheridan, Cloyne, Protestant Bishop of Cloyne (1679-1682) and Sir Thomas Sheridan (politician) Chief Secretary of State for Ireland (1687-1688). The Sheridan lands in Derrynacreeve were confiscated in the Cromwellian Act for the Settlement of Ireland 1652 and were distributed as follows: The 1652 Commonwealth Survey lists the townland as Dirrenacrew and the proprietor as Lieutenant-Colonel Tristram Beresford. The 1655 Down Survey map of Tullyhaw depicts the townland as Derrinecrew. In the Hearth Money Rolls compiled on 29 September 1663The Hearth Money Rolls for the Baronies of Tullyhunco and Tullyhaw, County Cavan, edited by Rev. Francis J. McKiernan, in Breifne Journal. Vol. I, No. 3 (1960), pp. 247-263 there was one Hearth Tax payer in - Dirinecre- Edmond McGawran. A further confirming grant dated 3 November 1666 was made by King Charles II of England to the aforementioned Sir Tristram Beresford, 1st Baronet included, inter alia, 38 acres-1 rood-24 perches of unprofitable land in Derrenetrew or Derrenetrue. By grant dated 11 September 1670 from King Charles II of England to said Sir Tristram Beresford, the lands of Derrenetrew were included in the creation of a new Manor of Beresford. A map of the townland drawn in 1813 is in the National Archives of Ireland, Beresford Estate Maps, depicts the townland as Derrynacreeve. The Tithe Applotment Books for 1827 list five tithepayers in the townland. The 1836 Ordnance Survey Namebooks state- The soil inclines to clay...a river likewise bounds it on the north. The Derrynacreeve Valuation Office Field books are available for 1839-1840. In 1841 the population of the townland was 60, being 29 males and 31 females. There were eleven houses in the townland, of which two were uninhabited. In 1851 the population of the townland was 45, being 19 males and 26 females, the reduction being due to the Great Famine (Ireland). There were nine houses in the townland, all were inhabited. Griffith's Valuation of 1857 lists nine landholders in the townland. In 1861 the population of the townland was 54, being 23 males and 31 females. There were eight houses in the townland and all were inhabited. In the 1901 census of Ireland, there are twelve families listed in the townland, and in the 1911 census of Ireland, there are thirteen families listed in the townland.

The church was dedicated to Saint Matthias. ==History== An earlier church was built just outside the Porta Saragozza for nuns from the San Mattia convent, a group of nuns originally derived from the Santa Maria del Monte della Guardia, who were guardians of the Basilica of San Luca. They resided in that convent until it was destroyed in 1537 in the wars between Bologna and the Visconti. Some time later they built a new convent on the via Sant'Isaia, re-using houses and other properties they had acquired there. The new convent's church was built between 1575 and 1588 by Pietro Fiorini to plans by Antonio Morandi, known as Il Terribilia. It housed the image of the Virgin from San Luca for two days each year during its annual procession. It was rebuilt in the 18th century, with lavish additions to the decoration but only minor alterations to the underlying architecture. The convent was suppressed in 1799 after the French invasion and ceded to a private owner. The city council converted the convent buildings into a school in the 1830s, which it still is today, whilst the church was deconsecrated and used as a warehouse until the end of the 1970s, when it and part of the monastery buildings were sold by the city council to the Sovrintendenza per i beni architettonici dell'Emilia Romagna.

The 180-minute version is divided into two parts:De Nuremberg à Nuremberg, édition Collector, éditions Montparnasse]. * Celebration and Triumph: the first part starts with the Nazi Party meeting held in Nuremberg on 15 September 1935, named Triumph of the Will.Triumph of the Will, an eponymous film by Leni Riefenstahl, depicts the 1934 Nuremberg Rally, while the 1935 rally was named \\"Rally of Freedom\\" (Reichsparteitag der Freiheit). The documentary errs in its allusion about this specific detail. It ends with the death of Stefan Zweig, on 13 February 1942.Zweig and his wife actually committed suicide on 22 February 1942 rather than on 13. This part focuses on the rise of Nazism, followed by the war of conquest of the Third Reich and its allies. * Defeat and Judgement: this part open with a description of Resistance movements in Nazi-occupied Europe, highlighting the differences of views between the various groups, especially Communists versus others.

Meyer stated that some of the cited facts, such as the German-Soviet non-aggression pact and some of its implications (notably petrol for the German planes involved in the bombings of London originating in the Soviet Union) were not well-known to the public in 1986, and that the documentary allowed some viewers to learn some details of the war. The film was delivered to Antenne 2 in 1987, but was not released for two years: firstly, it was not aired until after the French presidential election of 1988, as to avoid any semblance of opposition to its far-right candidate; furthermore, arguments such as « the French being divided » on the subject, or the notion that « Nazism does not interest anyone anymore », were put forwards and retarded the release. == Notes and references == === Notes === === References === Category:French documentary films Category:French films Category:Documentary films about historical events Category:Documentary films about World War II Category:Holocaust films Category:Films scored by Vangelis ","title":"De Nuremberg à Nuremberg"},{"id":"56630921","text":"is a Japanese cross-country skier.

It arose comparatively recently, after the beginning of the European Bronze Age, and is mostly prevalent in the population of the Pyrenees region. The regions where it has been mostly found are Basque Country, Navarre, Asturias, Galicia, Portugal, Aragon, Catalonia, Pyrénées-Atlantiques as well as a some presence in Great Britain and Ireland, though it has been found in smaller quantities as far away as Germany and Poland. Specific subclades of DF27 have been associated with specific groups of people, for example R-M167 is associated with the Catalans and R-M153 is associated with the Basques. ==Genetic testing== The technology to test for DF27 was developed by Thomas Krahn, then of Family Tree DNA. This marker was discovered to exist among people who had taken part in the Human Genome Diversity Project. Richard A. Rocca made a pioneering study of DF27, which was published in 2012 in the article Discovery of Western European R1b1a2 Y Chromosome Variants in 1000 Genomes Project Data, in the peer-reviewed journal PLOS Biology. He based his study on 208 people who had tested as R-M269 and were from Great Britain, Tuscany (Italy), Spain, Finland, Utah (United States) and Latin American (Colombia, Puerto Rico, etc). ==Distribution== According to a 2017 article published in Springer Nature entitled, Analysis of the R1b-DF27 haplogroup shows that a large fraction of Iberian Y-chromosome lineages originated recently in situ, DF27 was found in frequences of 40% in the general population of the Iberian Peninsula and in particular spikes at 70% among the Basques. Overall in France it accounts for between 6–20% of the population but has a high level in the Pyrenees area. It is estimated to have developed around 4,200 years ago in north-western Prehistoric Iberia as the Neolithic made way for the Atlantic Bronze Age. The DF27 subgroups correspond closely to the various pre-Roman kingdoms formed by the Celtiberians. ==Subclades== ===Y-DNA R-DF27 subclades=== === Y-DNA backbone tree === ==See also== * Genetic history of the Iberian Peninsula * Genetic history of Europe * Origin of the Basques * Atlantic Modal Haplotype ==References== ===Further reading=== * Dissection of the DF27 paternal lineage at Forensic Science International * Characterization of the Iberian Y chromosome haplogroup R-DF27 in Northern Spain at Forensic Science International ===Bibliography=== * ==External links== * R-DF27/S250 at The Big Tree * R DF27 and Subclades at Family Tree DNA * R1b-DF27.com R-M167 Category:Genetic history of Europe Category:Pre-Roman peoples of the Iberian Peninsula ","title":"Haplogroup R-DF27"},{"id":"56631043","text":"Greal y Corau (Welsh journal) Greal y Corau was a 19th-century Welsh language periodical, first published for the Welsh Choral Union, by Thomas Gee, in Denbigh, in 1861.

In 1628 he was sent to England, where he remained till 1632. In the latter year he enrolled as a student in King's College, Aberdeen, but he didn't take a degree. On 19 May 1636 he was served heir of his father by a dispensation of the lords of council, and on 28 Oct. of the same year he married the widow of John Urquhart of Craigston, by whom he had a son and daughter. ==Iconoclast== Brodie was a strong Presbyterian, and, in December 1640, headed a party which demolished two oil paintings of the Crucifixion and the Day of Judgment in the cathedral of Elgin and also mutilated the finely carved interior of the building as unsuitable for a place of worship. This extreme puritanical zeal exposed him to the revenge of Montrose, who, in February 1645, burned and devastated his property, and carried off the family papers of the house of Brodie. ==Shire commissioner== In 1643 he was chosen as Shire Commissioner for the county of Elgin in parliament, and frequently served on parliamentary committees. He was also elected a representative to the general assembly of the church of Scotland. On 6 March 1649 he was appointed a commissioner to meet Charles II at the Hague. ==Lord of Session== After Brodie's return from the Hague he was nominated a lord of session on 22 June. He took the oaths in the presence of parliament on 23 July, and took his seat on the bench on 1 Nov. In February 1650 he was sent as commissioner of the general assembly to Breda, to induce the king to sign the national covenant. He was also a member of the various committees of estates during the attempt of Charles to wrest from Cromwell his dominion. In June 1653 he was cited by Cromwell to London to arrange for a union between the two kingdoms, but did not obey the summons, and 'resolved', as he expressed it, 'in the strength of the Lord to eschew and avoid employment under Cromwell.' He retired to his estate until Cromwell's death, when, on 3 Dec. 1658, he again took his seat on the bench. At the Restoration he was superseded and was also subjected to a fine of £4,000, Scots. In 1661 he paid a lengthy visit to London. He died on 17 April 1680. ==Diary== The Diary of Alex. Brodie, from 25 April 1652 to 1 Feb. 1654, was published in Edinburgh in 1740 by an unknown editor. The complete Diary, from 1650 to 17 April 1680, with a continuation by his son, James Brodie (1637-1708), to February 1685, was published by the Spalding Club in 1863, with an introduction by David Laing. The part published in 1740 is chiefly concerned with his religious experiences, and is not an adequate sample of the Diary as a whole, which conveys much important information regarding political events, and a specially interesting account of his visit to London, and of the persons with whom he there came into contact.

Cybernetic Walrus' CEO Mike Coeck and Environment Artist Szabolcs Csizmadia was invited as a speaker to Unite Austin 2017. They gave a lecture on how the Cybernetic Walrus team used Unity 2017 to develop Antigraviator. In addition, assets from the game were used in the Unite Austin training day, where attendees learned to create an anti-gravity racing game of their own using Antigraviator's assets. The training series was later released through YouTube. == Reception == According to CBS Interactive's review aggregator Metacritic, the game received \\"mixed or average reviews\\", average rating is 65/100. == References == == External links == * * Iceberg Interactive Official Website Category:2018 video games Category:PlayStation 4 games Category:Video games developed in Belgium Category:Windows games Category:Xbox One games Category:Iceberg Interactive games Category:Futuristic racing games ","title":"Antigraviator"},{"id":"56631253","text":"right A Cannonball, also referred to as a Bomb, is a diving style where the diver hugs their knees and attempts to enter the water with their body shaped as much like a sphere as possible.

He was only moderately successful in school and at age 17 he went to the Kunstakademie Düsseldorf, where he was taught by Carl Friedrich Lessing, Wilhelm von Schadow, Peter von Cornelius and Theodor Hildebrandt. His first surviving independent work was a drawing of the Bruchhauser Steine. He then moved to the Academy of Fine Arts, Munich in 1832. There he met Louis I of Bavaria's court painter Wilhelm von Kaulbach. Whilst in Munich he produced 74 artworks, including two monumental frescoes in the Maximilianeum. He moved back to his birthplace in 1835, making sketches and illustrations for Faust before moving to Prague for seven years in 1841 then Munich for twenty years in 1850. He created a total of 300 works for Maximilian II of Bavaria and designed glass windows for Glasgow Cathedral (removed during World War Two and not yet reinstated). He finally moved to Arnsberg in 1870, producing 140 more paintings before his death, mainly of well-known families from Sauerland. == References == Category:19th-century German painters Category:20th-century German painters Category:People from Brilon Category:1813 births Category:1905 deaths Category:German portrait painters ","title":"Engelbert Seibertz (painter)"},{"id":"56631260","text":"Cristian Borja is the name of: *Cristian Martínez Borja (born 1988), Colombian football forward for América de Cali *Cristian Borja (footballer, born 1993), Colombian football defender for Deportivo Toluca ","title":"Cristian Borja"},{"id":"56631271","text":"thumb Johann Suibert Seibertz (27 November 1788, Brilon - 17 November 1871, Arnsberg) was a German lawyer, judge and historian.

Ilyashenko was a professor at Moscow State University, an academic at Steklov Institute, and also taught at the Independent University of Moscow. He became a professor at Cornell University.Yulij Ilyashenko, Mathematics Departement, Cornell University His research deals with, among other things, what he calls the \\"infinitesmal Hilbert's sixteenth problem\\", which asks what one can say about the number and location of the boundary cycles of planar polynomial vector fields. The problem is not yet completely solved. Ilyashenko attacked the problem using new techniques of complex analysis (such as functional cochains). He proved that planar polynomial vector fields have only finitely many limit cycles. Jean Écalle independently proved the same result, and an earlier attempted proof by Henri Dulac (in 1923) was shown to be defective by Ilyashenko in the 1970s.

His hagiography states that he came from a very rich pagan family and attributes many miracles to him, especially the curing of the madness of Antoninus Pius' daughter Agnes, which is described in a 9th century Passio Sancti Potiti. He refused to renounce Christianity and so was thrown to the lions, but they refused to attack and so he was instead thrown into boiling oil, but emerged unharmed. He was therefore pierced with a sword. ==Veneration== He is the main patron saint of Tricarico and its diocese and his main relics are sited in its cathedral. His cult spread widely during the Middle Ages, reaching Capua, Naples and Benevento. He is thus also the main patron saint of the town of Ascoli Satriano and its diocese. Ascoli Satriano has a church dedicated to him as well as a bust-reliquary containing part of his ulna in its former cathedral - this reliquary is carried round the town in procession between 18 and 20 August each year and at the end of the festival the ciuccio is burned. Naples also once had a church dedicated to him, San Potito, served by Benedictines, whom pope Clement XII granted a special office in the saint's honour, with hymns edited by the Bollandists.

He showed very promising form as a two-year- old in 1923 when he won both of his races,namely the Prendergast Stakes and Dewhurst Stakes. In the following year he won four of his ten races including the Princess of Wales's Stakes and the St Leger as well as being placed in the Newmarket Stakes and the Champion Stakes. In 1925 he finished second in the Ascot Gold Cup. After his retirement from racing he stood as a breeding stallion in England and South Africa and had some success as a sire of winners. ==Background== Salmon-Trout was a big, powerful, good-looking bay horse bred in England by Marmaduke Furness, 1st Viscount Furness. As a yearling the colt was put up for auction at Doncaster and was bought for 3,000 guineas by George Lambton, acting on behalf of Aga Khan III. Salmon-Trout was sent into training with Dick Dawson at Whatcombe, near Lambourn in Berkshire. He was sired by The Tetrarch an unbeaten horse who was regarded as one of the fastest two-year-old ever seen in Britain and Ireland, but whose career was ended by injury before he could race at three. The Tetrarch showed very little interest in his stud duties: his attitude towards sex was described as being \\"monastic in the extreme\\". Although he sired few foals his progeny included several major winners. Salmon-Trout's dam Salamandra was a top-class racemare, finishing third the 1000 Guineas and second in the Oaks Stakes in 1916, and a daughter of the 1000 Guineas winner Electra. Salamandra was bought by Lord Furness at Newmarket in December 1920 for 16,000 guineas with Salmon-Trout in utero. ==Racing career== ===1923: two-year-old season=== Salmon-Trout made his first appearance in the five furlong Prendergast Stakes at Newmarket Racecourse on 18 October and \\"scrambled home\\" from Windward and St Germans. At the next Newmarket meeting he stepped up in class and distance for the Dewhurst Stakes over seven furlongs on 1 November. Ridden by G Hulme and starting at odds of 4/1, he led from the start and won \\"very comfortably\\" from Hurstwood. At the end of the year Salmon-Trout was rated one of the Aga Khan's most promising juveniles, and in the official Free Handicap he was raked third behind his stablemates Mumtaz Mahal and Diophon. His two wins earned his owner £2,290. ===1924: three-year-old season=== Salmon-Trout's owner Aga Khan III On his second-season debut, Salmon-Trout finished unplaced behind Green Fire the Greenham Stakes at Newbury Racecourse in April. Salmon-Trout bypassed the 2000 Guineas and instead won the Hastings Plate over ten furlongs at the same meeting. On 21 May the colt contested the Newmarket Stakes (a trial race for the Epsom Derby) over ten furlongs at Newmarket. In a slowly-run race which developed into a sprint in the final furlong, he was beaten a neck by Hurstwood, with Lord Derby's Sansovino a head away in third place and Bright Knight (the Derby favourite before the race) just behind in fourth. The 1924 Derby Stakes was run in exceptionally wet and testing conditions at Epsom Racecourse on 4 June. Salmon-Trout, who was regarded as the Aga Khan's second string behind the 2000 Guineas winner Diophon was never in contention and finished sixth behind Sansovino who won easily from St Germans and Hurstwood. On his first appearance after his poor run in the Derby, Salmon-Trout contested the Princess of Wales's Stakes over one and a half miles on 3 July at Newmarket in which he was ridden by Vic Smyth and started at odds of 5/1. He won \\"in a canter\\" by three lengths and a head from Parmenio and Obliterate. He followed up by winning the Great Yorkshire Stakes over one and three quarter miles at York Racecourse in August. By this point in his career he was being described as a \\"sound stayer\\" but requiring careful training on account of his \\"delicate\\" legs. At Hurst Park, in his warm-up race for the St Leger, Salmon-Trout was partnered by Vic Smyth in the Richemount Three-Year-Old Stakes but failed to overhaul the improving Watford (ridden by Smyth's brother) and was beaten a head into second place. In the 149th running of the St Leger over fourteen and a half furlongs at Doncaster Racecourse on 10 September, Salmon-Trout was ridden by the Australian Bernard \\"Brownie\\" Carslake and started at odds of 6/1 in a field of seventeen runners. The complexion of the race was affected by an \\"epidemic of coughing\\" which ruled out Straitlace, Hurstwood and Bright Knight: Sansovino, St Germans, Polyphontes (Eclipse Stakes) and Salmon-Trout himself were also reportedly affected. Salmon-Trout was restrained at the rear of the field by Carslake and looked to have no chance of winning a furlong out as Santorb challenged the favourite Polyphontes for the lead. He then produced a remarkable turn of speed, took the lead in the closing stages, and crossed the finishing line two lengths clear of Santorb, with Polyphontes half length back in third. Before the race many bookmakers had lengthened their odds against Salmon-Trout on the basis of supposed \\"inside information\\" suggesting that the colt could not win, and some sustained heavy losses on the race as a result. Later that month the colt reappeared in the Kinsclere Plate at Newbury, but was surprisingly beaten by the outsider Depatch. On his final appearance of the season, Salmon-Trout finished third behind the four-year-olds Pharos and Parth in the Champion Stakes over ten furlongs at Newmarket in October. ===1925: four-year-old season=== Salmon-Trout remained in training as a four-year-old in 1925, with the Ascot Gold Cup as his principal objective. In the Gold Cup on 18 June he finished second to Santorb, beaten a length by the winner, with St Germans in third. ==Assessment and honours== In their book, A Century of Champions, based on the Timeform rating system, John Randall and Tony Morris rated Salmon-Trout an \\"average\\" winner of the St Leger. ==Stud record== After his retirement from racing Salmon-Trout became a breeding stallion and stood in England for eleven years before being exported to South Africa in 1937. His last reported foals were born in 1938. The best of his offspring were King Salmon (Coronation Cup, Eclipse Stakes) and Salmon Leap (Coronation Cup, Goodwood Cup). ==Pedigree== ==References== Category:1921 racehorse births Category:Racehorses bred in the United Kingdom Category:Racehorses trained in the United Kingdom Category:Thoroughbred family 19-c Category:St Leger winners ","title":"Salmon-Trout"},{"id":"56631717","text":"The men's singles event at the 2017 Asian Winter Games was held on 24 and 26 February 2017 at the Makomanai Ice Arena in Sapporo, Japan. ==Schedule== All times are Japan Standard Time (UTC+09:00) {class = \\"\\" style=\\"text- align:center;\\" ! width=220Date ! width=50Time ! width=150Event -  Friday, 24 February 2017  18:05  Short program -  Sunday, 26 February 2017  12:00  bgcolor=ffffccFree skating } ==Results== { class=  !width=40Rank !width=250Athlete !width=70SP !width=70FS !width=80Total -  align=left 92.43188.84281.27 -  align=left92.86187.22280.08 -  align=left91.56180.30271.86 -  4 align=left90.32172.99263.31 -  5 align=left82.74154.63237.37 -  6 align=left76.18157.75233.93 -  7 align=left 76.99151.68228.67 -  8 align=left72.75149.94222.69 -  9 align=left76.53135.43211.96 -  10 align=left 72.98125.90198.88 -  11 align=left 63.68126.51190.19 -  12 align=left 54.80134.79189.59 -  13 align=left 57.67126.76184.43 -  14 align=left 58.86109.56168.42 -  15 align=left 48.65101.08149.73 -  16 align=left 44.4993.92138.41 -  17 align=left 42.3886.03128.41 -  18 align=left 37.1682.61119.77 -  19 align=left 34.8560.8095.65 -  20 align=left 24.0764.6588.72 -  21 align=left 17.3041.7459.04 } ==References== ==External links== *Results Men ","title":"Figure skating at the 2017 Asian Winter Games – Men's singles"},{"id":"56631718","text":"thumb Tricarico Cathedral is a Roman Catholic cathedral church in the city of Tricarico.

He moved to Australia in his childhood and played for various prep schools in Canada and the United States, before forgoing college basketball. He is the younger brother of National Basketball Association (NBA) player Thon Maker and the cousin of basketball player Makur Maker. == Early life == Maker was born in what is now known as South Sudan on 1 January 1998, with his older brother Thon Maker. In Matur's early childhood, his uncle, a local administrator, helped the family flee to Uganda amid a civil war in their home country. They then settled in Perth, Western Australia as refugees when Maker was four years of age but continued making occasional visits to South Sudan. Matur first started playing soccer at Grayhounds soccer club, a club where many south Sudanese kids played for and alongside his brother Thon. At age 13, Matur was discovered by basketball scout Edward Smith and began living with him in Sydney, before moving to the United States. After his parents were satisfied by the decision, Matur was allowed to join his brother in high school and Smith eventually became their legal guardian. == High school career == Maker began playing high school basketball as a freshman at Carlisle School in Martinsville, Virginia, where he joined Thon, a sophomore, in the middle of the season. His guardian Edward Smith, who the brothers lived with in a two- story house, was an assistant coach for the team at the time. According to Smith, Matur's arrival at Carlisle helped Thon better acclimate to the United States. During his freshman season, Matur was considered one of the best high school players in the country at the small forward position. He helped Carlisle win a state championship and played with Team Loaded VA of the Amateur Athletic Union (AAU). For his sophomore year, Maker transferred from Carlisle, with Hopewell Academy in Cary, North Carolina and Orangeville Prep in Orangeville, Ontario as potential destinations. In September 2014, Maker and his brother enrolled at Orangeville Prep, where they played under head coach Larry Blunt and with fellow top prospect Jamal Murray. He was named Ontario Scholastic Basketball Association (OSBA) second-team all-star. In 2016–17, Maker moved to The Tech Academy in Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario, where he was coached by his guardian Edward Smith and became teammates with cousin Makur Makur. With the Milwaukee Bucks having selected Thon at the 2016 NBA draft, the transfer allowed Matur to live closer to his brother. In April 2017, Maker competed in the BioSteel All-Canadian Basketball Game in Toronto, where he was named most valuable player. In the game, he recorded 25 points and six rebounds, shooting 8-of-11 from the field, playing only 12 minutes. At an adidas Nations event in August, he averaged 26 points and seven rebounds for the Asia Pacific team. Maker played a postgraduate season of basketball at Mississauga Prep in Mississauga, Ontario for 2017–18. By 2018, he was averaging 25.5 points, 11.3 rebounds, 2.8 assists, 2.1 blocks and 1.7 steals. On 5 January 2018, Maker declared intentions to bypass college and enter the 2018 NBA draft, attempting to follow a similar path as his brother in 2016. He drew attention from scouts on 11 January, when he notched 45 points, 20 rebounds, two blocks, and three steals in a 95–85 defeat to GTA Prep. However, due to a lack of attention on his name during the 2018 NBA Draft process, he withdrew his name from the 2018 NBA draft on the 11 June international deadline. == Professional career == ===Union Neuchâtel (2018)=== On 7 August 2018, Maker signed with Union Neuchâtel of the Swiss Basketball League. Through 4 appearances, he averaged 5.8 points, 3.8 rebounds, and 0.8 assists in 13.9 minutes per game. ===Zlatorog Laško (2018–2019)=== On 30 December 2018, Maker signed with Zlatorog Laško of the Slovenian Basketball League. Maker played 17 games with Zlatorog and averaged 13ppg, 10rpg and lead his team to the playoffs. ===Rio Grande Valley Vipers (2019–present)=== On October 19, 2019, Maker signed with the Houston Rockets of the NBA, but was waived the next day.

Ahuja as Innovative Scheduling, Inc. The company headquarters is situated on 10 acres in Gainesville, Florida, and additional offices are located in Yerevan, Armenia; Bangalore, India; and Perth, Australia. Optym provides transportation software and specializes in the optimization, simulation and analytics of transportation and logistics for railroad, trucking, airline and mining industries. Optym employs decision automation and optimization solutions. ==History== ===Founding=== Optym was founded by researcher and academician Dr. Ravindra K. Ahuja in 2000 as Innovative Scheduling, Inc., which rebranded as Optym in 2014. Between 2004 and 2015, Optym was located at the Gainesville Technology Entrepreneurship Center (GTEC), a Santa Fe College-led business incubator. In 2015, the company moved its facility to the three-building Hillside Office Park off Tower Road in order to foster rapid expansion and hiring. In 2018, Optym is a global company with over 275 workers offering solutions to a variety of companies, including Southwest Airlines and United Airlines, CSX Transportation and other major railroads in Canada and Europe, Toyota, Walmart, R+L Carriers, Office Depot and BHP. Optym licenses its suite of decision support systems, builds custom software applications for clients, develops new systems by funding internal research and provides technology- enabled consulting services using software solutions. ===Financing=== Optym obtained its first Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) grant of $500,000 from the National Science Foundation (NSF) in 2004 to develop commercial software, specifically to build a decision support system addressing railroad blocking problems for CSX Transportation. It allowed Optym to hire its first set of full-time employees, including Krishna C. Jha, Wei Huang and Arvind Kumar, all of whom completed their Ph.D.’s at the University of Florida under Ahuja's guidance. In 2005, Optym received its Phase II SBIR grant to build a decision support system for train scheduling, and BNSF Railway provided a matching grant. These two grants, plus the licensing revenues from the product funded by the first NSF grant, provided continued funding for the research and development of optimization technologies for railroads. That year, Optym began building and commercializing its software solutions and investing profits into the research and development of new products. ===Expansion=== Optym's Armenia office opened in 2007 in the capital city of Yerevan with the goal of conducting research and development of innovative IT techniques. This allowed Optym to package optimization and simulation engines into desktop and web- and map-based applications. The Armenia office currently has about 50 developers who specialize in the latest databases, applications and UI development technologies. Optym started its development center in Bangalore, India, in 2013 with intentions to benefit from a large talent pool of computer engineers in optimization, machine learning, data analytics, data warehousing and software architecture. This location gave Optym a regional base to accommodate its growing list of global customers. In 2014, Optym's office in Perth, Australia, opened to serve local mining clients, including BHP. In 2017, Optym expanded its headquarters facility in Gainesville, Florida, by an additional 10,000 square feet to accommodate a growing workforce and expanding slate of projects. Due to rapid growth, Optym doubled its Gainesville team from approximately 60 employees in 2014 to 120 employees in 2017. ===Rebranding=== Optym's current corporate identity is the result of a rebranding strategy initiated in 2014; Innovative Scheduling, Inc. changed its name to Optym, which is derived from the word “optimization,” supposedly to better reflect the expanding range of work, both in the products and services offered and the industries served. The rebranding effort also included a new logo and the new tagline, “Live Efficiently”. ==Corporate affairs== ===Expertise=== Optym combines business intelligence, which includes harvesting big data, data visualization and advanced data analytics, with employees’ knowledge as industry-specific experts as well as technical experts in operations research, information technology, data analytics, computer science and project management. Optym's team is adaptive and agile in developing and delivering complex network optimization capabilities. Application developers create desktop and web applications, as well as mobile applications for iOS, Android and Windows platforms. A close relationship between Optym and the University of Florida has resulted in the company frequently hiring former undergraduate and graduate students as interns and full-time employees. ===Leadership=== Dr. Ravindra K. Ahuja is the founder and current CEO of Optym. Dr. Krishna C. Jha is Executive Vice President of Optym. Jha joined Ahuja in 2000 as his doctoral student and transitioned to working with Optym as one of the company's first team members in 2004. Jha focuses on the design and development of algorithms that solve real-life problems in scheduling, transportation and logistics, such as train scheduling, railroad blocking and crew scheduling. Dr. Wei Huang is Vice President – System Architecture at Optym and was one of Optym's first team members, having joined the company in 2004. He utilizes his academic experience to develop large-scale optimization models and guide Optym's software architecture solutions. Renzo Vaccari is Senior Vice President – Airline Solutions at Optym. He works closely with Southwest Airlines to develop and implement Amadeus SkyMAX and SkySYM by Optym. Dr. Arvind Kumar is Optym's Managing Director – India Operations and spearheads Optym's growth in the Asia-Pacific region. He works on Optym's core products to automate and optimize railroad and locomotive scheduling. Dr. Arthur Ghulyan joined Optym in 2016 as Executive Director – Armenia Operations. Ronda Lewis is Optym's Chief Revenue Office (CRO). ===Convergence conference=== Optym hosted its first invitation-only Convergence conference in February 2015, providing an opportunity for leaders in the transportation and logistics industries to exchange ideas, learn more about each other's challenges and discuss upcoming products. Sixty executives from major rail, airline and trucking companies met at Optym's Gainesville, Florida, headquarters to discuss how to increase efficiency within the transportation and logistics industries. During the second Convergence conference in Orlando, Florida, in April 2016, 120 executives from 15 countries and 50 companies, including American Airlines, United Airlines, Southwest Airlines, JetBlue, Frontier Airlines and Spirit Airlines; Amazon.com freight, FedEx Freight and UPS Freight; and BNSF Railway, CSX Transportation and Norfolk Southern Railway, met to discuss the conference's theme of Decision Automation. Leaders in the airline, trucking, railroad and logistics industries discussed ideas for solutions to rising costs and increasing business complexity, and Optym announced a new partnership with Amadeus. Keynote speeches were given by FedEx Freight strategic planning and engineering executives, Amazon.com’s Chief Scientist of Supply Chain and international speaker, business strategist and Gainesville local John Spence. The third Convergence conference was held in Miami, Florida, in September 2017 and focused on the theme of Decision Optimization. ===Hackathon=== Optym Armenia was the general sponsor and co-organizer of the Smarter Transportation Data Hackathon, which was a 24-hour event held in Yerevan, Armenia, on April 16, 2017. Thirty-three teams were selected to compete in three categories; չDNS team won for the category of most innovative solution with an existing functional prototype with a bicycle-sharing solution, Appress team won for the category of best business concept/idea with real-time decision optimization software for drivers and Babylon team won for the category of most valuable solution for Armenia with a smart food delivery platform based on machine learning. ===Awards and recognition=== Optym was one of two finalists for Best Tech Company at the Gainesville Area Chamber of Commerce's Business of the Year Awards in 2015. ==Products and services== Optym creates disruptive technologies to provide network planning and scheduling solutions for numerous companies and agencies worldwide that heavily rely on transportation and logistics – from large airlines to trucking owner-operators to the City of Gainesville. ===Sky=== Flight disruption is expected to become an increasingly expensive operational problem for airlines, airports and hotels to solve, motivating airline companies to invest in working with technology companies, such as Optym, to address disruption management. In 2016, Optym and Amadeus IT Group entered into a long-term partnership to optimize Amadeus's flight scheduling, utilize its global network, technical sophistication and knowledge of the travel industry and unlock an additional 1-3% of current revenues, totalling millions of dollars. Optym's suite of network planning solutions for Amadeus can provide optimized schedules in a few hours rather than the previous delivery time of days to weeks. This suite is the first solution of its kind to be able to create a schedule from scratch, giving airlines greater strategic flexibility in an increasingly competitive airline market. Amadeus SKY Suite by Optym is the first system that optimizes flight times, fleet types, thru-flights and aircraft routings simultaneously instead of separately. The Amadeus SKY Suite by Optym consists of SkyMAX for flight schedule optimization and maximizing profitability, SkySYM for schedule reliability simulation and reduction of operational costs related to aircraft flows, passenger flows, maintenance activities, weather patterns, ATC events and crew and baggage delays, SkyPLAN for route frequency optimization and maximizing revenue generation, SkyCAST for network schedule forecasting and projecting profitability and SkyWORKS for schedule management and increasing efficiency. In 2015, Southwest Airlines began testing SkyMAX and using SkySYM to strengthen the operational reliability of flight schedules in relation to on-time arrivals, schedule recoverability and passenger connections. ===Rail=== Optym received its first railroad project from CSX Transportation in 2004. It was tasked with optimizing locomotive planning function, and, in 2007, the collaboration resulted in the development of the real-time train scheduling system RailMAX. In addition to RailMAX, Rail by Optym consists of TrainMAX, CrewDESIGN, RailBIS, RailVIEWR, YardSYM, LocoMAX and YardMAX to automate decisions and simulate train movement, yard movement and locomotive assignment. ===Haul=== Optym entered the trucking industry in 2011 when it started research to solve less-than-truckload (LTL) linehaul planning problems, which are considered some of the most difficult optimization problems due to the physical and liability limitations inherent in serving residential customers. Haul by Optym, consisting of HaulPLAN and HaulVIEWR, was developed to solve these problems and address the increased urgency caused by growth in the e-commerce fulfilment industry. Several top LTL carriers expressed interest in and eventually licensed Optym's load plan creation and network optimization software product HaulPLAN in 2016. To improve performance and reduce costs, YRC Freight and its subsidiaries use the load plan software, and FedEx uses Optym's haul scheduling software ===Mining=== In 2012, Optym entered the mining industry with the development of network simulation and optimization solutions for BHP. Optym first developed a solution to simulate the movement of trains in the rail network connecting mines to ports and then developed a real-time train scheduling system. ===Urban=== DriverMAX was released in early 2017 and is a collaboration between Optym and Greyhound Lines to produce a software solution for driver route planning, which previously presented a significant efficiency challenge because it was done manually. The algorithm- based system incorporates human experience and insight to generate routes for over 1,000 drivers in less than one hour. Use of DriverMAX is expected to increase drivers’ wages, improve drivers’ quality of life and reduce Greyhound's operational costs by several million dollars annually. The success of DriverMAX presents opportunity for further collaborations between Optym and Greyhound's other areas of business ==See also== * Ravindra K.

It was designed by sculptor Mathias Goeritz, a Mexican artist of German origin\\"MUSEO EXPERIMENTAL EL ECO: THE SCULPTURE OF MATHIAS GOERITZ\\", MXCITY.MX, Retrieved on 19 February 2018. who worked closely with the Mexican architect Luis Barragán.\\"El Eco Museum Extension, Mexico City, Mexico\\", Architizer, Retrieved on 19 February 2018. Originally built in 1952–53, the gallery was extended by FR-EE/Fernando Romero Enterprise in 2007 \\"to expand its offices and special services to improve daily operations\\". == History of the building == In 1952, businessman Daniel Mont commissioned artist Mathias Goeritz to build a place that would articulate a new relationship between his commercial interests of a restaurant-bar and the avant-garde spirit of some cultural actors of the time, with the intention of finding something different from what was established. Under the premise \\"do whatever you want\\", Goeritz conceived the space on Sullivan Street in Mexico City. It was designed as a poetic structure whose layout of corridors, ceilings, walls, rooms and openings led its visitors to reflect their experience of space in an emotional act; This concept challenged the dominant interests of functionalism in architecture at that time. Based on his \\"Manifesto of emotional architecture\\", his writings also refer to inspiration of religious experiences and Gothic and Baroque architecture. Goeritz conceived the building as a penetrable sculpture. This space was the creation of an unprecedented platform for the arts in the context of Mexican and international art of the 1950s. In 2004, the Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México bought the building which re-opened its doors on 7 September 2005 after many months of restoration work to bring the building back to its original state. The project was intended to revive Goeritz's architectural legacy.Periódico El Universal == Pabellón Eco == Pavilion for architecture competition at the Museo Experimental el Eco in Mexico City.

The village is located by the European route E4 about south of Lövånger. ==History== Until 1951, the village's name was Kräkånger. Kräk is thought to be derived from a dialectal word meaning \\"sharp angle\\" or \\"small bay\\", and is related to modern Swedish krok (\\"hook\\") and krök (\\"bend\\"), while ånger in Swedish place names typically means \\"bay\\". The name may refer to the bay which historically (around 500AD) stretched from Lövånger to Bureå, forming a sharp angle with what was at the time the Lövånger Fjard. As cars were becoming commonplace in the 1940s, the name, and that of neighbouring village Kräkångersnoret (now Södra Lövsele), attracted ridicule from visitors due to the modern Swedish associations it suggests: kräk[as] means \\"[to] vomit\\", ånger means \\"regret\\", and snor[et] means \\"[the] snot\\". As a result, the local population expressed their wishes to change the name, and the new name Lövsele was formed from sele, referring to the nearby lake Selet (the remnants of the fjard from which the earlier name had been derived), and löv, referring to Lövånger parish. ==References== Category:Populated places in Skellefteå Municipality ","title":"Lövsele"},{"id":"56632194","text":"The women's singles event at the 2017 Asian Winter Games was held on 23 and 25 February 2017 at the Makomanai Ice Arena in Sapporo, Japan. ==Schedule== All times are Japan Standard Time (UTC+09:00) {class = \\"\\" style=\\"text- align:center;\\" ! width=220Date ! width=50Time ! width=150Event -  Thursday, 23 February 2017  16:50  Short program -  Saturday, 25 February 2017  17:00  bgcolor=ffffccFree skating } ==Results== { class=  !width=40Rank !width=250Athlete !width=70SP !width=70FS !width=80Total -  align=left 61.30126.24187.54 -  align=left58.65116.95175.60 -  align=left53.16121.88175.04 -  4 align=left60.98100.39161.37 -  5 align=left55.0299.39154.41 -  6 align=left50.9995.71146.70 -  7 align=left 58.9079.67138.57 -  8 align=left49.9982.65132.64 -  9 align=left47.1583.88131.03 -  10 align=left 47.8179.58127.39 -  11 align=left 44.6482.71127.35 -  12 align=left 41.6568.72110.37 -  13 align=left 40.8067.97108.77 -  14 align=left 25.7162.8488.55 -  15 align=left 28.5455.1183.65 -  16 align=left 25.1657.1982.35 -  17 align=left 26.8953.1280.01 -  18 align=left 23.3153.3776.68 -  19 align=left 24.3346.6670.99 -  20 align=left 22.2148.0170.22 -  21 align=left 21.6948.4670.15 -  22 align=left 18.6744.1562.82 -  23 align=left 18.5342.4460.97 -  24 align=left 16.8130.8847.69 } ==References== ==External links== *Results Women Asia ","title":"Figure skating at the 2017 Asian Winter Games – Women's singles"},{"id":"56632200","text":"Yao Yan (, born 22 August 1988) is a female Chinese international table tennis player.

He is noted as a leading militarist in the struggle for the independence of Ecuador and other South American countries. Admiral Thomas Charles Wright ==Childhood== Thomas Wright was born in Queensboro, Drogheda, Ireland, on 26 January 1799, the son of Joseph Wright and Mary Montgomery. At the age of 11 he was sent to the Royal Navy college at Portsmouth, at that time regarded as the finest in the world, where he studied to become an officer. ==Career in the Royal Navy== Following his junior office training, he embarked to sea at the age of 14 on board under the captaincy of George Stuart. On this vessel he sailed to the east coast of the United States where he was engaged in blockading activities in the squadron of Admiral Borlaise Warren. In 1817 he returned to England having attained the junior officer's rank of midshipman. ==South American campaigns for independence== Navy Ship commanded by Thomas Charles Wright With promotional opportunities diminishing in the Royal Navy, Wright having passed the Lieutenant's examination, but still without a commission, in union with many young junior officers in Britain he decided to enlist in Simón Bolívar's revolutionary army and sail for South America in support of the uprisings against Spanish colonial rule. In November 1817 Wright enlisted as an officer in the British Legion of Simón Bolívar, under the patronage of Luis Lopez Mendez, Bolivar’s agent in London, he was one of the first to volunteers to enlist. Originally setting off from the River Thames in November 1817, several snags delayed the departure until 2 January 1818 then departing from Fowey harbour he sailed on a brigantine named Dowson, under naval commander Captain Dormer, with 200 other volunteers armed with valuable weapons and ammunition, and after several weeks they landed at the West Indies. In this army corps of 200 men he was under the command of Colonel Campbell, and they were known as the Rifles Corps. These troops were then placed under the command of Colonel Pigott – His Majesty 54th Foot. Admiral Brion arrived with his squadron on the Island of St Thomas and Pigott and his followers were shipped on Patriot vessels to Margarita Island off the coast of Venezuela arriving on 21 April 1818. They were sent to Guayana and then to Angostura, thus beginning the campaign in the Apure. At Angostura (present-day Ciudad Bolívar Wright first met Simón Bolívar, for whom he developed a deep admiration. Bolívar opened the liberating campaign in Apure. During 1818–1819, one of his earliest battles with Wright partaking as an officer was at Trapiche de Gamarra on 27 March 1819. These encounters inspired Bolívar to begin his New Granada campaign and the march over the Andes. Wright accompanied Bolívar on the legendary crossing on which 25% of the British/Irish troops died. He took part in the entire land campaign to liberate the northern countries of South America, and fought with in numerous land battles with Bolívar's army, including, Pantano De Varges on 25 July, the Battle of Boyacá on 7 August 1819, Cienega de Santa Martha on 10 November 1820, and the Battle of Carabobo on 24 June 1821. Further battles included Bombona on 7 April 1822 and Pasto in September 1822. Wright was to play leading roles in the Vargas Swamp Battle, and later in the victory at Boyacá in August 1819, after which he was promoted to captain. In 1820 he returned with his Rifles regiment to the coastal plains to campaign in the jungles east of the Magdalena against the Spanish based on Santa Marta. He fought at the Battle of Ciénaga on 10 November 1820, the outcome resulted in the capture of the town. The Rifles Corp were then transported by sea to Maracaibo, and on 21 June 1821 partook in Simon Bolívar's decisive victory at Carabobo. Cartagena was also seized and the Rifles were brought in boats up the Magdalena en route to Popayán. They formed part of the forces led by Bolívar in the second of his famed Andean campaigns. After the successful battle at Bomboná on 7 April 1822, Wright was twice mentioned in Bolívar's order of the day for his exceptional skill and courage. Again he was promoted and from February 1822 Wright was acting lieutenant-Colonel, a rank to which was later confirmed in 1823, when he was serving under General Sucre, who joined up forces with Bolívar in Ecuador. In 1823 the Rifles were shipped to Peru. ==Independence struggle and naval battles== Thomas Charles Wright in action against a superior ship In early 1824, Bolívar knew that despite the Patriot Army success on land unless the South American revolutionary armies could control the seas off their coasts they would forever be under sea blockade from imperial Spain. General Bolivar appointed Wright to the newly fledged united pacific naval squadron. After Guayaquil seized independence, a young British naval officer John Illingworth Hunt, was appointed as Commanding General of the Maritime Department. Immediately he took care of organizing everything concerning the Navy, The new government was acquiring some ships indispensable for the maintenance of the Grancolombiana sovereignty in the Pacific. Thus, in 1823, the first Ecuadorian naval force was formed with the following warships; the schooner Guayaquileña, the brig Chimborazo and the corvette Pichincha. Wright, who in February 1824 was promoted to captain, became Commodore of the South Squadron, and embarked on the brig Chimborazo, where he had his flag pennant hoisted, and conducted patrols along the Peruvian coast with seven transports properly equipped and ready to assist in the transfer of troops, when Bolívar, who was with his army in Peru, would require it. Bolívar with his army defeated the royalist forces at the Battle of Junín on 6 August 1824. After this, Wright was instructed to proceed to Callao with a squadron of five ships and was placed under the orders of Admiral Martin Guise, head of the United Squadron. The Grancolombian units, forming this squadron, participated in some naval actions against the royalists and also in the blockade of Callao, the last Spanish stronghold in South America. Bolívar installed him as a Commodore of the Pacific Southern Squadron, He was appointed to command this small fleet of ships including Chimborazo, Guayaquileña, Pichincha, and other minor vessels in support of Admiral Martin Guise and joined the Patriotic naval force blockading off Callao. Wright, Admiral Martin Guise, and a handful of other former Royal Navy officers spearheaded the blockade of Callao that successfully fought the Spanish naval squadron sent to lift the blockade of the besieged city. The first ship under his command was Guayaquileña, formerly Lady Collier. During the blockade the Spanish royalist ships based in Callao tried to run the blockade and escape, and became engaged in combat with the blockading fleet. He was highly praised for his action. During the exchanges Wright's brigantine Chimborazo sustained three water-line hits and collided with the ship 'Asia', but he prised himself free and escaped. The blockade held and Callao capitulated in early 1826 and Spanish rule in South America was at a close. During this period Wright on Chimborazo had become personally close to Bolívar and he ferried him from port to port over the entire Pacific coast. Bolívar while at sea was at most risk of capture and at his most vulnerable and his aides strongly advised against these sea voyage risks. Despite this Bolívar continued to sail with Wright one of his original officers on voyages from port to port. ==Founding father of the Ecuadorian Navy== Admiral Thomas Charles Wright Memorial Guayaquil The revolutionary independence struggles ended with the unfolding liberation of South America countries, and Wright settled in Ecuador where he helped establish the Ecuadorian Navy and helped create the Ecuadorian naval school that was named in his honour. ==Post independence war with Peru== The downfall and expulsion of the Spanish colonial power later led to land disputes and new wars among the South American home nations that once were united against Spain. In 1827, Peruvian President José Lamar invaded Bolivia, then invaded Ecuador. Wright had settled in Ecuador after the ousting of the Spanish, and now he took up the cause of defending his new adopted homeland. Wright's navy fought two battles with the Peruvians in the Gulf of Guayaquil. ==Battle of Punta Malpelo== President Bolívar resolved to declare war against Peru on 3 June 1828. Antonio José de Sucre, who had been the President of Bolivia since 1826, resigned his office (under duress) and was appointed Commander of the Gran Colombian Army. The Peruvian declaration of war against Gran Colombia occurred on 3 July 1828 when the Peruvian Government, under President Jose de La Mar, ordered a mobilization of its ground and naval forces. The first engagement of the conflict took place on 31 August of that year when the Peruvian corvette Libertad, under the command of Carlos García del Postigo, on patrol in international waters to the west of the Gulf of Guayaquil with the purpose of blockading that port, was attacked by the Gran Colombian ships Pichincha and Guayaquileña under the command of Thomas Charles Wright, off Punta Malpelo. During the battle both sides were forced to disengage with heavy loss of life on board their vessels. Wright was injured in the fighting as was Postigo who was severely wounded and fled, and the blockade on the city was lifted. ==Assault on Guayaquil== The Peruvian squadron, commanded by Admiral Jorge Martin Guise, made a number of raids in the area of Guayaquil before directly attacking the defenses of that city from 22 November to 24 November 1828. In this campaign, he managed to eliminate the Ecuadorian/Colombian defenses afloat and to silence much of the enemy artillery, but, on the night of 23 November, the Peruvian frigate Presidente ran aground, and the Colombians took advantage of the situation to counterattack. At dawn, with the arrival of high tide, the frigate was refloated under fire. One of the last enemy sniper shots hit Guise, mortally wounding him. Control of the squadron was assumed by his first lieutenant, José Boterín, who continued the siege. The city finally surrendered on 19 January 1829. After this victory, the corvette Arequipeña and the brig Congreso repaired to Panama to rescue a Peruvian merchant ship that had been captured by the Gran Colombians.

At the time, a pack of 20 cigarettes costed £6.76. Xavier Ducarroz, Marketing Director at Philip Morris said the following about the name change: \\"Raffles continues to be a successful range, but we were conscious that the brand needed to be refreshed. Virginia S. offers the same classic taste that adult smokers of Raffles have grown to love with a much more modern, contemporary look and feel\\". ==Advertising== Various poster and magazine adverts were made to promote the brand in the 1980s and 1990s. A lighter and toiletries with the Raffles logo were also made. Philip Morris International would introduce various special offers during the 1980s and 1990s via many leaflets. If you bought a pack or a carton of Raffles cigarettes, you would get a free Tumbler glass, a T-shirt, a cafetière, a Wallet and so on. Other special offers included a 75 pence off if you handed over a voucher at a Kwik Save store in the United Kingdom, a free pack offer when the Raffles 10-pack variant was introduced, a third free pack if you bought 2 packs of Raffles cigarettes and so on. ==Controversy== ===Off- license manager loses job over Lamont lies=== In December 1992, it was reported that an off-license manager who claimed that Norman Lamont bought cheap champagne and cigarettes at his shop had left his job after admitting he made up the story. His deputy, who also confessed to fabricating the report but was not directly responsible, had been disciplined and would return to work, a company spokesman said. David Newton, manager of the Thresher's branch in Praed Street, Paddington, West-London, and John Onanuga, his assistant, attended a disciplinary hearing at Thresher's headquarters in Welwyn Garden City, Hertfordshire. They had claimed the Chancellor spent £17.47 on a bottle of Bricout champagne and a pack of Raffles cigarettes at their branch on 16 November 1992. The story was denied by the Chancellor and by Thresher's, who said that it was \\"wholly inaccurate\\". Mr Lamont said he bought three bottles of wine at a branch near Marble Arch the day before, while returning from his official residence in Buckinghamshire. The Treasury produced a till receipt backing his claim. In a statement, Thresher's said that Mr Newton \\"was primarily responsible for the fabrication and for what has taken place since\\".

Brinton. == Academic career== Brinton graduated with dual B.A. degrees in Comparative Literature and German Language and Literature from the University of California, Berkeley (1970). Subsequent to this, she completed M.A. degrees in German from Purdue University in 1972 and in Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages (TESOL) at the University of California, Los Angeles in 1981. Her early career in English as a second or foreign language (ESL/EFL) took place in Germany from 1972-1976. For the bulk of her academic career, Brinton worked at the University of California, Los Angeles in a variety of positions, including Associate Director of the UCLA Center for World Languages, Lecturer in Applied Linguistics, and Academic Coordinator of the UCLA ESL Service Courses.Innhwa Park, 2009. \\"A Field of Exciting and Diversified Opportunities: An Interview with Donna Brinton,\\" UCLA Issues in Applied Linguistic 17(1), pp. 51-65 https://escholarship.org/content/qt2652473x/qt2652473x.pdf She later worked as Professor of TESOL at Soka University of America and as Senior Lecturer in the Rossier School of Education at the University of Southern California (USC) designing and teaching online classes in the MAT-TESOL program. In addition to teaching numerous applied linguistics and TESOL classes, Brinton is a prolific author of books and articles in the field as well as frequent presenter at national and international conferences. She has made a name for herself in the areas of second language pronunciation pedagogy, content-based instruction (CBI), and general TESOL methodology. She is also known to the wider applied linguistics community as a long-term editor of The CATESOL Journal, a publication of the California Association of Teachers of English to Speakers to Other Languages.CATESOL Editorial Staff page http://www.catesoljournal.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/CJ9_staff.pdf To pre- service teachers, she is most widely known for her teacher reference texts, the 2010 Teaching Pronunciation: A Reference and Course Text (2nd. ed., with others), the 2014 Teaching English as a Second or Foreign Language (4th ed., with others) and the 2017 Content-based Classroom (2nd ed., with Marguerite Ann Snow). Several of her works highlight an approach to language teaching known as content-based instruction (CBI), in which the new language is the medium of instruction, so that the language and content are taught simultaneously. This takes advantage of the connectedness of the form and function of language.Daryl M.

It lies in the Roman Catholic parish of Corlough and barony of Tullyhaw. ==Geography== Drumbeagh is bounded on the north by Gubrawully townland, on the west by Altinure, Tullandreen, Tullynamoltra and Corraclassy townlands and on the east by Curraghabweehan, Derryvahan and Drumcar (Kinawley) townlands. Its chief geographical features are the Owensallagh river (A source of the River Blackwater, County Cavan), forestry plantations, a stream and dug wells. Drumbeagh is traversed by the R200 road (Ireland) and rural lanes. The townland covers 187 statute acres. ==History== In the Plantation of Ulster by grant dated 27 February 1610, along with other lands, King James VI and I granted one poll of Drombeagh and Corroboan to William O'Shereden, gentleman, Cheefe of his Name. William Sheridan was the chief of the Sheridan Clan in County Cavan. He was the son of the previous chief, Hugh Duff O'Sheridan of Togher townland, Kilmore parish, County Cavan. William was the ancestor of the famous Sheridan theatrical family. William died sometime before 1638 leaving two sons, Owen (of Mullaghmore, Tullyhunco) and Patrick (of Raleagh townland, Kildallan parish). Owen Sheridan succeeded to his father's lands. Owen's son Denis was born in 1612 and became a Catholic priest in charge of Kildrumferton parish, County Cavan. He later converted to Protestantism and on 10 June 1634 William Bedell, the Protestant Bishop of Kilmore, ordained him as a Minister of the Church of Ireland and two days later Denis was collated to the Vicarage of Killasser in the Diocese of Kilmore. Denis had several children, including William Sheridan (Bishop of Kilmore and Ardagh) 1682-1691 (his son Donald kept up the Templeport connection by marrying Mrs Enery of Bawnboy); Patrick Sheridan, Cloyne, Protestant Bishop of Cloyne (1679-1682) and Sir Thomas Sheridan (politician) Chief Secretary of State for Ireland (1687-1688). The Sheridan lands in Drumbeagh were confiscated in the Cromwellian Act for the Settlement of Ireland 1652 and were distributed as follows: The 1652 Commonwealth Survey lists the townland as Drombeagh and the proprietor as Lieutenant-Colonel Tristram Beresford. A further confirming grant dated 3 November 1666 was made by King Charles II of England to the aforementioned Sir Tristram Beresford, 1st Baronet included, inter alia, 76 acres and 3 roods in Curraghboghan and Drumbeagh. By grant dated 11 September 1670 from King Charles II of England to said Sir Tristram Beresford, the lands of Curraghbegan and Drumbeagh were included in the creation of a new Manor of Beresford. The 1790 Cavan Carvaghs list spells the name as Drombeagh. A map of the townland drawn in 1813 is in the National Archives of Ireland, Beresford Estate Maps, depicts the townland as Drumbaugh. The Tithe Applotment Books for 1827 list ten tithepayers in the townland. and The Drumbeagh Valuation Office Field books are available for September 1839. In 1841 the population of the townland was 87, being 47 males and 40 females. There were fifteen houses in the townland, all of which were inhabited. In 1851 the population of the townland was 82, being 47 males and 35 females, the reduction being due to the Great Famine (Ireland). There were fifteen houses in the townland, all were inhabited. Griffith's Valuation of 1857 lists twenty-three landholders in the townland. In 1861 the population of the townland was 68, being 34 males and 34 females. There were fourteen houses in the townland and all were inhabited. In the 1901 census of Ireland, there are seven families listed in the townland, and in the 1911 census of Ireland there are eleven families listed in the townland. A description of Drumbeagh in the 1930s by Emily Montgomery is available at- A distinguished native of the townland was Father Francis McSpiritt. ==Antiquities== # The Corraclassy 110kV Electricity Substation # A lime-kiln # Stepping Stones across a stream # The site of Drumbeagh Hedge School in Cox’s Lane.

It is estimated that there are around 300,000 child soldiers around the world and 40 percent of them are girls. Children are also victims of armed conflicts. They are forced to evacuate, suffer from sexually transmitted diseases and are deprived of education opportunities. ==Background== The presence of children in the war can go back to Middle Ages and Napoleonic Wars. Children fought in the American Civil war, significantly contributed to the Battle of New Market which was fought in Virginia (May 15, 1864). Children were also fighting in the World War II, especially noted to serve as \\"Hitler Youth\\". However, in modern days, the number of child victims is increasing as the proportion of civilian casualties is also increasing. In 18th, 19th, and early 20th centuries, about half the war victims were civilians while it was almost 90 percent by the end of the 1980s. Children compose a large part of the population affected by wars, data from the American Psychology Association show of the 95 percent of civilians killed in recent years’ by modern armed conflicts, approximately 50 percent of them were children. According to United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), the estimated casualties of children during the last decade was: \\"2 million killed, 4–5 million disabled, 12 million left homeless, more than 1 million orphaned or separated from their parents, and some 10 million psychologically traumatized\\". Currently, there are over two million child refugees fleeing from Syria and over 870,000 refugees from Somalia. Among 100,000 people who have been killed in Syria, at least 10,000 were children. == Potential risk factors of war on children == === Direct exposure to violence === ==== Death and injury ==== By being directly exposed to violence such as bombing and combats, children are killed during conflicts. In 2017 alone, there were 1,210 terrorist attacks around the world, mostly happening in Middle East region and 8,074 fatalities. There were nine terrorist incidents with more than hundred deaths in conflict zones. Under the Trump administration, civilian casualties from the United States armed forces are at all-time high in Syria and Iraq. Also, children are more likely to be injured by landmines. Twenty percent of landmine victims are children in mine-affected countries. They are often intrigued by colorful appearance of landmines and explosives. Children can lose sights or hearing; lose body parts; suffer from the trauma. At least 8,605 people were killed or injured by landmines in 2016 and 6,967 casualties in 2015. Most of them were civilians and 42 percent of civilian casualties were children and the number of child casualties were at least 1,544 in 2016. ==== Sexual violence ==== The United Nations define the term \\"conflict-related sexual violence\\" as \\"rape, sexual slavery, forced prostitution, forced pregnancy, forced abortion, enforced sterilization, forced marriage, and any other form of sexual violence of comparable gravity perpetrated against women, men, girls or boys that is directly or indirectly linked to a conflict\\". More than 20,000 Muslim girls and women have been raped in Bosnia since 1992. Many cases in Rwanda show that every surviving adolescent girl was raped. Sexual violence also causes sexually transmitted diseases – such as HIV/AIDS – to spread. One of the factors is involvement with military forces as they sexually abuse and exploit girls and women during conflicts. Besides, as HIV- positive mothers give birth to HIV-infected children without anti-retroviral drugs, the prevalence of HIV/AIDS tend to spread fast. === Unmet basic needs during warfare === War disrupts the supply of necessities to children and their families like food, water, shelter, health services, and education. Lack of access to these basic needs may deprive children of their physical, social- emotional, and psychological development. In case of South Sudan, constant violent conflicts along with climate shocks greatly damaged the agriculture- based economy. As a result, more than 1.1 million children are suffering from severe food shortages. In countries across Africa and the Middle East, over 2.5 million children are suffering from severe acute malnutrition. Economic sanctions such as trade restrictions from international community and organizations may play a role in serious economic hardship and deterioration of infrastructure in armed conflict zones. This makes it extremely difficult for children to survive as they are usually in the most bottom level of socioeconomic status. As of 2001, around half a million Iraqi children were predicted to be dead due to sanctions regime. Detrimental parenting behavior can also affect child development. In a war context, families and communities are not able to provide an environment conducive to the children's development. Mike Wessells, Ph. D., a Randolph-Macon College psychology professor with extensive experience in war zones explained; \\"When parents are emotionally affected by war, that alters their ability to care for their children properly. War stresses increase family violence, creating a pattern that then gets passed on when the children become parents.\\" Scarcity of resources increases cognitive load which affects attention span, cognitive capacity, and executive control that are critical abilities to reason and solve problems. Reduced mental and emotional capabilities caused by stress from a war can degrade their parenting capabilities and negatively change behaviors towards children. Disruption of education also occurs with the destruction of schools during wars. The human and financial resources are compromised during crisis. The United Nations reported that more than 13 million children are deprived of education opportunities and more than 8,850 schools were destroyed because of armed conflicts in the Middle East. According to UNICEF report, In Yemen, 1.8 million children were out of education in 2015. Between 2014–2015, almost half a million children in Gaza Strip were not able to go to school because of the damages on schools. In Sudan, more than three million children cannot go to school because of the conflicts. In Mozambique, around 45 percent of primary schools were destroyed during the conflict. Fear and disruption make it hard for children and teacher to focus on education. This generates an educational gap, depriving children of essential education, building social-emotional skills, and thus reintegrating into society. In addition, gender equality can also be compromised as education disruption in armed conflict zones generally excludes girls. == Impact on psychological development of children == === Brain development === Early childhood experience accounts for a large part of human brain development. Neural connections for sensory ability, language, and cognitive function are all actively made during the first year for a child. The plasticity and malleability which refer to the flexibility of the brain is highest in the early brain development years. Therefore, the brain can be readily changed by surrounding environments of children. In that sense, children in armed conflict zones may be more susceptible to mental problems such as anxiety and depression, as well as physiological problems in the immune system and central nervous systems. Stress in early childhood can impede brain development of children that results in both physical and mental health problems.National Scientific Council on the Developing Child. (2005/2014). Excessive Stress Disrupts the Architecture of the Developing Brain: Working Paper 3. Updated Edition. http://www.developingchild.harvard.edu Healthy brain and physical development can be hampered by excessive or prolonged activation of stress response systems. Although both adrenaline and cortisol help prepare the body for coping with stressors, when they are used to prolonged and uncontrollable stress, this stress response system can lead to impairments in both mental and physical health. Lack of basic resources may also impede child brain development. Childhood socioeconomic status influences neural development and affects cognitive ability and mental health through adult life. Especially, poverty is regarded to deteriorate cognitive capacity. Many studies have shown that poverty in early childhood can be harmful in that poor families lack time and financial resources to invest in promoting child development. This suggests that the serious deprivation of resources in armed conflict zones is extremely detrimental to cognitive development of children during warfare. Okasha and Elkholy (2012) have theorized that psychological immunization can help children who are frequently exposed to conflict to better acclimate themselves to the stressors of war. === Attachment theory === Children who are detached from a family in early age may go through problems regarding attachment. Children under five are more likely to experience a greater risk of depression and anxiety compared to adolescents. Attachment theory suggests that the ability of a child to create attachment can be deterred by deviant environmental conditions and reflected experiences with caregivers. Different types of attachments can be formed with different caregivers and upbringing environment. In addition, different experiences of attachment in childhood are known to be related to mental health issues in adulthood. === Other psychological impacts === Children in war-zones witness and experience horrendous violent activities which may lead to development of psychological disorders such as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). By 2017, 3 million children from Syria have witnessed effects of war directly. 80% of the 94 Iraqi children exposed to the Feb 13, 1991 bombing showed PTSD symptoms. Also, study shows that 41 percent of Palestinian children from Gaza Strip suffered from PTSD. The incidence of the effects of war has a 10 to 90 percent variation in terms of developing PTSD, depression and behavioral problems. PTSD is known to have intergenerational effects. == Rehabilitation issues == === Reintegration into society for child soldiers === There are around 300,000 child soldiers around the world. Disarmament, demobilization, and reintegration (DDR) programs are conducted to rehabilitate child soldiers and war-affected children. The creation of DDR in Sierra Leone was led by UNICEF in 1999. However, disarmament consistently failed to attract female combatants who were forced to provide sexual services as they were too afraid to step forward for demobilization process. Child soldiers are often stigmatized and confronted with discrimination from community. Reintegration and rehabilitation depends on the level of violence occurred in the region, acceptance from family and community, and resources like education and training programs to recover war-affected youth. The Paris Principles suggest extensive and detailed guildelines on reintegration of children associated with armed forces or armed groups. === Psychological treatment process === Psychological treatment is considered to be more challenging after the age of five. This is because the plasticity of the brain reduces after the age of five since much of the brain's development occurs before the age of six. Long- term psychological treatment is many times required. Some children develop resilience and are able to overcome significant adversity. Helpful community surroundings and stable caregivers are regarded as being able to build capacity to recover from adverse childhood experiences. == Intervention programs for children in war-zones == === Narrative exposure therapy === Narrative exposure therapy is a short-term individual intervention for treatment of PTSD based on the cognitive-behavioral exposure therapy. KidNET is a narrative exposure therapy used with war-affected children aged 12–17 years. Under this, the mental health professional encourages the patients to describe the events of their life – from birth till present. Improvements through KidNET are seen in the refugee children in eastern Europe, children affected by the Rwandan genocide, and the children in Sri Lanka. Testimonial psychotherapy is another short-term individual treatment for the war-affected individuals in which they record their experiences with trauma. These recordings are then later analyzed by doctors along with the patients to understand how the personal experiences are connected to trauma. === Dyad Psychosocial Support === Dyad psychosocial support is a family-level treatment for mother and children affected by war aiming at the emotional and psychological development of children. One example of the program was carried out in Bosnia for a duration of 5-month in which weekly meetings of the mothers were carried out to discuss their children’s development, coping mechanisms, and trauma. This program indicated net positive results in terms of the \\"maternal mental health, children's weight gain, and children's psychosocial functioning and mental health\\". === Youth Readiness Intervention Program === Youth Readiness intervention program (Sierra Leone) is aimed at youth in the war to treat emotional and psychological issues and inculcate pro-social behavior in them. A study by Betancourt et al. evaluates results from Sierra Leone. It reports positive results. == See also == * Adverse Childhood Experiences Study * Children in the military * Developmental psychology * Stress in early childhood == References == Category:Aftermath of war Category:Age and society Category:Anti-war Category:Adverse childhood experiences Category:Child labour Category:Children in war Category:Children's rights Category:Human rights abuses Category:Military life Category:Military personnel Category:Military sociology Category:Slavery Category:Youth rights ","title":"Impact of war on children"},{"id":"56632464","text":"The pair skating event at the 2017 Asian Winter Games was held on 24 and 25 February 2017 at the Makomanai Ice Arena in Sapporo, Japan. ==Schedule== All times are Japan Standard Time (UTC+09:00) {class = \\"\\" style=\\"text- align:center;\\" ! width=220Date ! width=50Time ! width=150Event -  Friday, 24 February 2017  14:20  Short program -  Saturday, 25 February 2017  15:00  bgcolor=ffffccFree skating } ==Results== ;Legend *WD — Withdrawn { class=  !width=40Rank !width=250Team !width=70SP !width=70FS !width=80Total -  align=left Zhang Hao Yu Xiaoyu 77.90145.98223.88 -  align=left Jin Yang Peng Cheng 67.24129.82197.06 -  align=left Kim Ju-sik Ryom Tae-ok 65.22112.18177.40 -  4 align=left Kim Hyung-tae Kim Su-yeon 49.28100.12149.40 -  5 align=left Alex Kam Kim Kyu-eun 46.6495.24141.88 -  6 align=left Ryo Shibata Narumi Takahashi 48.7881.75130.53 -  7 align=left Matthew Dodds Paris Stephens 29.5262.3891.90 -  — align=left Ryuichi Kihara Miu Suzaki   WD } ==References== ==External links== *Results Pairs ","title":"Figure skating at the 2017 Asian Winter Games – Pairs"},{"id":"56632465","text":"Chang Chenchen (born 20 June 1986) is a female Chinese international table tennis player.

Her boyfriend Phil is a widower who lives on his own across the road; his wife Celia died eight years ago. Phil tries to persuade her to marry, each sell their houses and move to a warm climate together. Edith's immature 49-year-old son Roger unexpectedly arrives with his bags, delighted in telling her that he has left his unpleasant wife Wendy after 19 unhappy years with her. He also says how happy he is to have left his twin teenage children Jason and Jennifer, as well as his job at the bank. He is horrified when Edith tells him that his father disposed of many of his possessions years ago, which Roger believes were valuable. Edith and Phil are annoyed at Roger's return and his childish behaviour. He plans to visit their neighbour Annie, with whom he was friends when they were children - believing that they should be a couple. Edith informs him that she moved to Canada years ago. Wendy arrives and Roger hides in the shed, then becomes stuck whilst trying to climb through a window in the house. Wendy confronts Roger as he is stuck, then Edith tells her to leave as Edith frees him from the window. The episode achieved 7.19 million viewers. Episode 2: Birthday: 25 February Edith's daughter Sandra visits for Edith's 70th birthday and suggests that Edith sell her house and move in with her. Sandra also asks her for £50,000 to help with her businesses. Roger and Sandra are both horrified at Edith and Phil's plan to marry. Roger tells Phil that Phil's ex-lover and ex-stalker Desiree, is back in the area, driving a delivery van. Phil tells Roger to go back to Wendy and informs him that he and Edith are planning to move to Gozo. Edith is horrified at Roger hiring Queenie Gale, whom Edith disliked when she did housework for Edith decades ago. Roger suggests to Edith that he continue to live in the house and that she not sell it. Phil supports Roger's proposal, because Roger will otherwise order a delivery from Desiree's company, bringing her to the house. Wendy arrives, angry that Roger has sold their car. The episode achieved 5.53 million viewers. Episode 3: The Marriage Counsellor: 4 March Mrs Gale tells Edith and Wendy that she was a marriage counsellor in Tasmania and can help repair Roger and Wendy's marriage.

They do so briefly, but minutes later Wendy cannot bear Roger's childishness and phones Phil to tell him that the reconciliation is off and that she does not want to see Mrs Gale again. Edith and Phil go on a seaside weekend break together. The episode achieved 5.96 million viewers. Episode 4: The Burglary: 11 March Wendy visits to tell Edith that Roger let the mortgage go into arrears. She also tells Edith of a dream she had in which she killed him. Phil walks along the street, where he encounters neighbour Mr Dugdale, who informs him of the recent death of his dog Wellington, which Phil tells Edith and Wendy of. Roger tells Edith that he never wanted Wendy and that he only married her to be in an advantageous position to leave her for her sister Rose, when Rose became single. His plan failed and he was stuck with Wendy. At night, a one-armed burglar, Bob Whitley, breaks into the house and plays (I Can't Get No) Satisfaction very loudly. Edith comes downstairs and recognises him because they went out together for a few weeks in 1962. Roger comes downstairs. Phil, Wendy, the police and Mrs Gale arrive separately. The police ignore Bob and instead take Roger and Wendy with them because the car which Roger recently bought for Wendy to replace the one he sold is stolen. The episode achieved 4.47 million viewers. Episode 5: Roger the Carer: 18 March Phil lends Sandra £30,000, which Roger and Edith disagree with. Bob persuades Roger to register as Edith's carer in order to receive Carer's Allowance from the government, despite her being in good health and not needing care. After talking to staff at the benefits office - during which he falsely claims that she is seriously disabled - they tell him that they need to meet Edith at the house. Roger tells Sandra that Edith and Phil want their hair cut at her salon at the time when Felicity (Alexandra Roach) from the Benefits Agency will be visiting. Roger tricks Mrs Gale into pretending to be Edith and that she is disabled. When Edith and Phil arrive at the salon, they think that Sandra wanted the appointments to be at that time. Sandra suspects that Roger is doing something wrong and goes to the house. Roger involves Sandra, who phones Phil to help with the deception and her plan to make it seem like Roger is insane. Felicity is confused and leaves in a stressed state. Roger tells Bob that their plan failed. The episode achieved 4.06m viewers. Episode 6: Old Flames: 25 March Phil encounters Mr Dugdale, then Bob - whilst walking along the street. Bob is wearing a prosthetic arm and indicates to Phil that he is still attracted to Edith. Sandra visits, but leaves without talking to Roger. Roger tells Edith that he made an unsuccessful attempt to claim Carer's Allowance for looking after her. He flies his new drone in the back garden and quickly loses it. Bob finds it and brings it back to Roger. Phil answers the door to Desiree (Shobna Gulati), whom he had not seen for six years, to deliver a package for Roger. Mrs Gale tells Roger that she has won £2,000 on the National Lottery, but has lost the ticket. Desiree faints in the street and is brought into the house by Bob. Desiree finds the ticket in a magazine in the house while bonding with Edith. Phil threatens Bob, and tells him to stay away. Having cashed in the ticket Desiree found, Mrs Gale brings home a Chinese takeaway for everyone in the house - including Wendy (whom she invited), Sandra, Desiree and Bob. Phil tells Wendy that he has instructed an estate agent to put his house on the market. The episode achieved 4.15 million viewers. Christmas Special: If I Were a Wise Man: 23 December Edith plans one last Christmas with the family before she and Phil embark on their sunset journey, and Phil's anxiety about not selling his house leads him to a spooky encounter. ===Series 2 (2019)=== Episode 1: The Sale: 2 August With their sunset retirement together waiting on the sale of his house, Phil despairs of finding the right estate agent. The current one, Roland Percy, suggests an Open Day, but Phil baulks at the idea. Edith, meanwhile, is heartened to find that her son Roger's earning some sort of a living even if it is only busking with her old flame Bob the Burglar, and performing a vent act with his toy crocodile Methuselah. Sandra is becoming impatient with Roger's ex-wife Wendy's need for company and steers her to the local community centre where she suggests she may find something to keep her busy. Queenie confesses to Edith that she can't bear the thought of her going away, and when she hears that plans are currently stalled by the difficulty of selling Phil's house, she sees her chance to influence events. She recruits Sandra to help talk Phil into having an Open Day after all. Jack Dugdale, walking his St Bernard dog Bertie, stops for one of his usual chats with Phil and hears the latest on his plans for his and Edith's future. They discuss Roger's well-being, and Dugdale wonders if being left in charge of Edith's house might be the making of him. Roger and Bob take their busking to the naked ladies fountain at York House, but the police chase them away and Bob collapses. Dugdale, a retired medic, comes to the rescue, and calls an ambulance. Phil gives in to the general persuasion that he should hold an Open Day, and Queenie makes sure he will personally attend and persuades Roger that some special entertainment would not go amiss. Wendy explores possibilities at the community centre and takes to the Creative Writing Class. When viewers arrive at Phil's house they find Roger busking off-puttingly on the doorstep and, as they treat themselves to Sandra's lavish hospitality, Queenie plants rumours about damp and evil spirits. Edith and Phil turn up to find his house invaded by doubtfully gossiping freebooters, the estate agent happily over- indulging on free wine, and Roger cavorting about in a rabbit costume. Phil blows his top and the viewers scatter to the winds. Later Edith, Sandra and Queenie are all laughing about the disastrous day when suddenly they realise Phil has disappeared. Episode 2: The Disappearance: 9 August Phil's house has been withdrawn from the market by his estate agent, who thinks he is insane, and he hasn't turned up for his regular morning meeting with Edith. As she and Sandra hurry to Phil's house, Edith receives a phone call from her sister Joan inviting herself to stay. Meanwhile, Roger is visiting Bob in hospital. He tells Bob that he has thought of a new way to make money and has let his mother's spare room, online, to two Americans. Bob's estranged goth daughter Georgie arrives from Glasgow to see how he is, and Roger takes a shine to her. As she has nowhere to stay, he offers her his room. Then, as he is making up the sofa for himself in the sitting room, Joan arrives demanding the spare room. Edith returns home to find her house full of unexpected guests and her demanding sister. Episode 3: Aunty Joan: 16 August Phil discusses his ongoing house sale difficulties with Dugdale, who is glad that he has recovered after last week's disappearance and says he might be interested in buying the house. Phil imparts this good news to Edith, along with the bad news that a surveyor has found dry rot. Edith's sister Joan joins them and it is clear that she and Phil get along no better than she and Edith. One of her more annoying traits is that she keeps promising everyone bequests in her will. Roger visits Bob at his temporary digs, a caravan by the river, and tells Bob about Phil's dry rot. Bob persuades him that this is the sort of thing surveyors make up, and they should inspect it themselves. But as they explore the attic, Phil arrives with Dugdale in tow. Episode 4: The Lemming Family: 23 August Edith and Phil discover a local bookshop hosting a local author, Wendy Stevens, who is signing her first book, The Lemming Family. Thrilled that Wendy's writing ambitions have come to fruition, Edith steers Phil into the shop to congratulates her, but Wendy seems alarmed at the prospect of Phil reading the book. Over a coffee immediately afterwards, Phil is outraged to find out that the characters in the book are thinly disguised portraits of himself and the family. Roger continues to busk by the riverside with Bob, and is horrified to spot among the crowd a familiar face: Mrs Pool, the woman from social services, with whom Roger had a run-in when he fraudulently applied to be a paid carer for his mother, impersonated by Queenie. Episode 5: Damage Limitation: 30 August With her annoying sister Joan safely packed off home, Edith is thrilled when Phil announces that Jack Dugdale has made an offer on his house, which he has accepted. Now they can get on and plan their future together, starting with the wedding. But theirs is not the only romance in the air. While out jogging, Dugdale astonishes Sandra by proposing to her. Wendy's book, The Lemming Family, is fast becoming a best seller, which is affecting all the family, who are thinly disguised as characters in it. Phil calls a meeting to prepare for a showdown with Wendy. Episode 6: Doing A Bunk: 6 September Removal men are busy at Phil's house after its eventual sale to Jack Dugdale. Dugdale is now engaged to Edith's daughter, Sandra, and the two prospective grooms discuss their respective plans. Bob's daughter Georgie, an art student, has started making a video about Roger and his fixation on his crocodile puppet Methuselah, but decides it is not working, so Roger suggests she make a video of Phil and Edith's wedding instead. Later, he tells Edith how he will miss her and her biscuits, and then breaks it to her that he is in love with Georgie. ==References* * Category:2018 British television series debuts Category:2010s British sitcoms Category:BBC high definition shows Category:BBC television sitcoms Category:English- language television shows Category:Midlife crisis in television Category:South Bucks District Category:Television series about couples Category:Television series about dysfunctional families Category:Television series about old age Category:Television series about siblings Category:Television series about widowhood Category:Television shows set in Buckinghamshire ","title":"Hold the Sunset"},{"id":"56632583","text":"Valerie Kleiser (born 11 January 1993) is an Austrian bobsledder.

He has received a great deal of popularity amongst fans for his unusually friendly and helpful demeanor, as well as his signature gesture, \\"Praise the Sun\\", which involves holding up both arms up in a Y-shape with palms facing outward while standing on tiptoes. He is voiced by Daniel Flynn. == Characteristics == Like the player character, Solaire is an Undead who journeys to the land of Lordran from his homeland of Astora, albeit on a personal mission to \\"find his very own Sun\\". His world and the player's come into contact at various times during the game, and he gives the player a White Soapstone item during his first meeting so that the player can be summoned into other worlds as phantoms and \\"engage in jolly cooperation\\". He also offers to provide assistance for various bosses during the course of the game. His \\"summon sign\\" glows gold rather than the typical white, and he rewards the player with \\"Sunlight Medals\\" for a successful co-op fight, due to his membership in the covenant called the Warriors of Sunlight. The player may join the covenant upon meeting certain requirements, after which they can be summoned by a wider range of players, and gain the \\"Praise the Sun\\" gesture and \\"Lightning Spear\\" miracles. Solaire is described as a skilled warrior who does not rely on any special powers to win beyond his signature miracles. His armor and shield are decorated with a hand-painted sun, reflecting his worship of the Sun, and by association, Lord Gwyn. While he was theorized by some fans to be Gwyn's firstborn son in disguise, this was later proven not to be the case in Dark Souls III. He uses a longsword called the Sunlight Straight Sword, which is described as a \\"featureless long sword contain[ing] the very power of the sun\\", as well as being \\"well-forged, and [kept] in good repair [...] but unlikely to live up to its grandiose name\\". The sword reappears in Dark Souls II as the Sun Sword, and in Dark Souls III under its original name, where it does have the special power to boost the attack of allies. His armor and shield are also obtainable in Dark Souls III by trading various items. The player typically last encounters Solaire in Lost Izalith, where he has gone insane and hostile upon donning a Sunlight Maggot, which he considers to be his \\"Sun\\". However, if the player opens a shortcut and kills the Maggot beforehand, Solaire retains his sanity and can be summoned for the final boss. == Development == The \\"Praise the Sun\\" gesture was conceived prior to the character of Solaire, and was a rare holy gesture used in Demon's Souls upon casting a miracle while wearing the \\"Ring of Sincere Prayer\\". The game's director, Hidetaka Miyazaki, secretly left the gesture in the game, despite being told by the game's publisher that the pose was not \\"cool enough\\" upon physically demonstrating it. From then on, the pose gained personal significance to him, and he was determined to also include it in Dark Souls. Miyazaki created the character of Solaire in order to bring recognition to the gesture and make it more popular, purposely positioning him as a \\"champion\\" who is the first truly helpful NPC that most players see in the game. He is also Miyazaki's favorite character, with Miyazaki going as far as to design the Sun emblem that appears on Solaire's armor. Miyazaki has stated that Solaire being taken over by the Sunlight Maggot, was intended as \\"the general norm\\", but that if Solaire is kept alive and fights alongside the player for the last boss, it is the \\"happiest ending\\", as he links the flame in his own world and dies by \\"becoming the Sun\\". == Merchandise == On the March 8 Nintendo Direct, Nintendo announced a Solaire Amiibo that would be compatible with Dark Souls Remastered. The Amiibo, featuring Solaire in a \\"Praise the Sun\\" pose, would cause the player's character to perform the gesture from the start of the game when tapped, without any prerequisites. However, the Amiibo was exclusive to GameStop, causing heavy shortages in availability and making it rarer than usual. == Reception == Destructoid named Knight Solaire one of their favorite new video game characters of 2011, calling him \\"the embodiment of selfless camaraderie and generosity\\", as well as \\"bat-shit crazy\\". He was also called a \\"total badass\\" by Eurogamer. The mission to save Solaire was called one of the 20 most unique sidequests in video game history by GamesRadar+, saying that \\"if there ever was an NPC worth saving, it would be him\\". Solaire was modded into Darkest Dungeon as a playable character by a fan of the game, which was called a \\"fantastic mixup\\" of the two games by PC Gamer. He also was given Easter eggs in Borderlands 2 as the similarly named \\"Knight Solitaire\\", and in World of Warcraft: Warlords of Draenor as a follower named \\"Soulaire of Andorhal\\". A \\"Praise the Sun\\"-inspired gesture was included as an emote in Destiny called \\"Praise the Gun\\". == References == Category:Fictional knights in video games Category:Male characters in video games Category:Video game characters introduced in 2011 Category:Souls (series) Category:Fantasy video game characters Category:Video game characters who use magic Category:Video game characters with electric or magnetic abilities ","title":"Solaire of Astora"},{"id":"56632595","text":"Victoria Hahn (born 17 March 1993) is an Austrian bobsledder.

The class of two ships were to be a continuation of the project which began in 1913 but were not built due to the outbreak of World War I. While approved by the Naval Ministry for construction, funding for the design was rejected by the French Parliament in 1920. While never built, the two ships of the class were to be named Lion and Guépard. The names were later reused later by two ships of the . ==Design and development== Beginning with the 30 March 1912 promulgation of the Statut Naval (Naval Law), France began developing new doctrines and designs for their destroyer fleet. The Naval Law stipulated that France should build fifty-eight new flotilla craft, for a total of one-hundred fifteen torpilleur d'escadre (fleet torpedo boats) by the year 1920. This initially led to the order of two M89-class destroyers originally planned for 1915 but neither would be laid down to the start of World War I. In the interim France ordered twelve from the Empire of Japan, and seized four nearly completed destroyers under construction in France. These seized ships became the and were originally ordered for the Argentine Navy. While construction of the M89 class never proceeded, work on the project continued into the immediate interwar period. Work on the torpilleur d'escadre project had already resumed in 1917 but, by the end of the war, revisions had become necessary. Advances in military technology and the development of new fleet doctrines meant the original project for a single 1500-class of multi-role \\"fleet torpedo boat\\" was to be split into two new, separate roles. These were the previous torpilleur d'escadre, and a new role, torpilleur-éclaireur (torpedo scout). The primary role of this new class was to act as scouts for the fleet. The secondary role of the new, larger vessel was defending against attacks by enemy torpedo boats on the French line of battle. Attacking the enemy line of battle themselves, was a distant tertiary objective. This shift in doctrine began in 1919, when Chief of the Naval General Staff, admiral Ferdinand-Jean-Jacques de Bon (fr) pointed out to Georges Leygues, the Minister of Marine, that between 1914–1918, the Italian had completed or laid down twelve flotilla leaders, compared to the French Navy, which had only built three during the four years of war. Italy, although allies to France during the Great War, was also seen as a growing rival to the Third Republic in the Mediterranean Sea. Flotilla Leaders were a type of destroyer that were larger and more heavily armed than normal destroyers and torpedo boats. These ships were designed to act as flagships for destroyer squadrons and to be able to defeat other destroyers. For the first time, using the English term, \\"destroyer\\", Admiral de Bon suggested than rebuilding of France's flotilla ship force should be the Marine Nationale's highest priority, followed by light cruisers and lastly capital ships. The flotilla craft force would be made up of the torpilleur d'escadre, and the new torpilleur-éclaireur. Minister Leygues agreed and accepted the suggestions of 4 March 1919. The new design for the \\"torpedo scout\\", was based heavily on advancements in naval warfare developed during the First World War. Using intelligence on Allied shipbuilding plans, the Naval Constructors Department (Service technique des constructions navales, STCN) were influenced by the 2,000-tonne Italian and the 1,625-tonne Royal Navy . The design was also influenced by the former Imperial German Navy S113 a large torpedo boat (Großes Torpedoboot) which was taken by France after the Treaty of Versailles as reparations from Germany and recommissioned as Amiral Sénès. The German 'torpedo boat' (really a large destroyer) was even larger than the Leones, displacing 2,060 tonnes and armed with four 150 mm guns. The new design requirements called for a robust hull, with improved seakeeping abilities and speed. Newly developed Modèle 1919D torpedoes were chosen over the older Modèle 1912D torpedoes originally planned for the M89 design. The original torpilleur d'escadre was planned to be armed with /25 guns to be built by Schneider-Creusot. The problem was that now, their short barrel length made them unsuitable for the increased expected ranges destroyers were expected to fight at (). In response to the new threat of air attack from airplanes, the new ships were to be armed with high-angle /50 anti-aircraft guns. The new \\"torpedo scout\\" was also now to be armed with depth charges for use against another new weapon of war, submarines. Improved construction techniques were also requested. The new ships would be built with three compartments for damage control purposes, and each compartment would have a dedicated bilge pump. As design work continued the nomenclature continued to evolve. With greater emphasis on destroying enemy torpedo boats continued, the 'torpilleur- éclaireur' role continued to evolve and over time led to the revival of an older designation that had fallen out of usage since the 300-ton , the 'contre-torpilleur' (counter-torpedo boat), a large multi-role destroyer capable of scouting and combat. ==Cancellation== With these new technical requirements the Superior Naval Council ()) proposed a final design for the Marine Nationales new generation of flotilla craft. A new torpilleur d'escadre and a new contre-torpilleur design were approved 28 April 1920 by the new incoming Minister of Marine, Adolphe Landry. Two contre-torpilleurs of the new design were accepted by the Ministry of Marine for the next naval estimates (naval budget) and were to be named Lion and Guépard. Both designs though suffered from the same issue, the main armament. The original requirements from the STCN called for guns. These guns would have a longer range than the M89s guns (which were never built). The choice of a gun would give French destroyers a heavier calibre than the contemporary British 120 mm/40 naval gun and the Italian 120 mm/45 naval gun. Instead the CSM contre-torpilleur design was armed with five single mounted Canon de 100 mm Modèle 1917 which were the most modern French destroyer guns available at the time. The STCN reluctantly accepted the design for the two destroyers in order to expedite construction. The Lion-class destroyers were to act essentially as prototypes for future French destroyers and her successors were expected to be armed with larger calibre guns. Concerns about the small calibre main armament of the destroyers continued to dog the project even after acceptance by the STCN. The French Parliament which shared similar concerns, eventually rejected funding for the two ships. Work on the destroyer project continued after this set back. On 14 January 1921 work began on designing a larger, more heavily armed contre- torpilleur based on the Lion class which eventually became the . Work on the torpilleur d'escadre program became the and was initially also to be armed with four of the same 100 mm guns as the Lion class. Both of these destroyer programmes were eventually armed with the recently developed Canon de 130 mm Modèle 1919. ==Footnotes== ==Bibliography== * Category:Destroyer classes Category:Proposed ships ","title":"Lion-class destroyer"},{"id":"56632945","text":"Nolok () is a 2019 Bangladeshi romantic drama film directed by Sakib Sonet.

The railway was built by C. E. Loss & Company of Chicago. The first summer resort season on the railway opened on June 15, 1895, while the railway was formally opened on June 25, 1895. Waukesha is situated west of Milwaukee and has become of national reputation on account of its mineral springs at the end of the 19th century, and developed to one of the best-known resorts of wealthy people from Chicago and Milwaukee. Aside from its spring water and the beauties of the town, Waukesha has had, originally, no attractions to make it popular as a resort. The new rail road, which was long, brought it within easy reach of Pewaukee Lake, a beautiful sheet of water about six miles long and a mile and a half wide. The railway was intended simply for summer pleasure travel to the lake and was planned to be shut down in winter. The railway line connected the terminus at the North-western Railroad depot in Waukesha with the beach of the lake. The railway company carried out extensive improvements at the beach, which it owned, and it became a beautiful spot. The improvements included the Palm Gardens ballroom, a hotel, 3 roller coasters, a fun house and many other amusement rides. Well known entertainers such as Ted Mack, The Andrews Sisters and Heine & His Grenadiers were featured at the park. In 1897, a baseball diamond was added, where a Milwaukee team, managed by the legendary Connie Mack, played an exhibition game. The railway bought and fenced-off its entire right of way. The construction was much the same as that of a good, solid, steam road, except that the grades were heavier and some of the curves sharper than would be called good practice unless in a mountainous country. The rails were standard 60-pound T rolled by the Illinois Steel Company. An abundance of gravel ballast was obtained along the route, and the contractors have put in a very solid roadbed over which trains ran as smoothly as if on the best steam trunk lines. The time usually taken between one terminus and another was about 15 minutes. The schedule, including switching at terminals, was a round trip every 40 minutes. A trip has been made in 12 minutes. Usually there were no stops between terminals. The profile of the road was furnished out by William Powrie, the engineer. From Waukesha a climb was made of 140 feet in the first three miles and a descent of about 90 feet in the last three. The heaviest grade was 3.2 per cent. The deepest cut and the greatest fill were each. Outside of the city limits of Waukesha there were no curves of more than 6 degrees, and when not too heavily loaded or when running down grade the cars made 40 miles an hour around them. At the crossing of the Fox River in Waukesha a plate girder bridge 50 feet long was erected. At the Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad crossing interlocking home and distant semaphore signals were put in so that trains on neither road stop unless compelled to by the signals. == Rolling stock == Two trains were kept in operation. The rolling stock consisted initially of three motor cars and four trailers. All were open except one motor car which was closed. They were all over all and the open cars had twelve seats. They were Pullman built mounted on Brill maximum traction trucks. The motor equipment consisted of two 50-horse-power Walker motors to each car. The Walker company has been devoting special attention to motors of this class for interurban service, and the results in this case were very satisfactory. The original two-motor cars were replaced with four-motor 100 type cars in 1903. Year-around service began to West Limits on 11 December 1899. == Power plant == The power plant contained a 250-horse-power Allis Corliss steam engine and a 150-kilowatt Walker generator and switchboard apparatus. The trolley line was divided into three sections, each fed separately. == Management == TMER&L; car and single phase transformer substation at Waukesha Beach, 1911 Alfred M. Jones, who was well known under the familiar name of \\"Long Jones,\\" was the first president. The operation of the road was initially under the charge of C. L. Jones, formerly of the Milwaukee Street Railway. The railway was bought by The Milwaukee Electric Railway and Light Company in August 1897 for $62,500. == Decline and closure == By the late 1930s, financial problems and increased auto ownership led to the final abandonment of operations to the park on July 21, 1941. The interurban totally ceased operations on July 2, 1951. After World War II, Waukesha Beach became less of an attraction & the entire park closed in 1949. Today, the original 20 acres used for the amusement park are known as \\"Beach Park\\", a subdivision of homes. == References == Category:Defunct Wisconsin railroads Category:Interurban railways in Wisconsin Category:Streetcars in Wisconsin Category:Transportation in Milwaukee Category:History of Milwaukee Category:Electric railways in Wisconsin Category:Companies based in Wisconsin Category:1895 establishments in Wisconsin Category:1949 disestablishments in Wisconsin ","title":"Waukesha Beach Railway"},{"id":"56633010","text":"Flag of Mexico Mexico has sought to ensure food security through its history. Yet, despite various efforts, Mexico continues to lack national food and nutrition strategies that secure food security for the people. Food security is defined as \\"when all people, at all times, have physical and economic access to sufficient, safe and nutritious food that meets their dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life\\" by the World Food Summit in 1996. As a large country of more than 100 million people, planning and executing social policies are complex tasks. Although Mexico has been expanding its food and nutrition programs that have been expected, and to some degree, have contributed to increases in health and nutrition, food security, particularly as it relates to obesity and malnutrition, still remains a relevant public health problem. == Introduction == The multifaceted nature of food security includes the combination of four elements: * Food availability: Food availability refers to the adequate supply of quality food, provided through domestic production, imports, and aid. * Food access: Food access refers to how easily the adequate supply of quality food can be accessed. * Food stability: Food stability refers to both the availability and access dimensions of food security. A household or individual, to be food secure, must have access to adequate food at all times and should not risk access to food as a result of sudden crises or cyclical events like seasonal food insecurity. * Food utilization: Food utilization refers to the way that the body physiologically uses the food. This is affected by both external circumstances, such as how the food is prepared and the variety of foods consumed, and internal circumstances, or how the body biologically utilizes the nutrients. Food insecurity is a situation of limited or uncertain availability or ability to acquire safe and nutritious foods. It has been associated with negative impacts on human development such as increased poverty and inequality and with adverse health outcomes such as increased risk of being obese. Food insecurity has also been correlated with poor economic growth.300x300px In Mexico, differences in parts of the country are caused by factors such as socioeconomic status and urban/rural residence. The North region is the most industrialized, has a high per capital income and infrastructure, and has sufficient access to basic services. Although less developed than the North, the Central region still consists of large developed cities like Guadalajara. The South region is the least developed, has the most rural and indigenous inhabitants in Mexico, and has insufficient access to basic services. Therefore, health issues like infectious diseases and undernutrition are especially prevalent. ==History== Starting in the 1980s, various economic reforms changed productive sectors in Latin America. The Mexican agricultural sector, in particular, was affected when the state of Mexico began advocating for an export policy. The Mexican government undertook more radical attempts to restructure policy to further involve the agricultural sector into the global market such as joining the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). Furthermore, as a result of the 2008 global financial crisis, Mexico's economic activity declined. Mexico’s gross domestic product (GDP) fell sharply, and its economy shrank by 6-7% in 2009. Its food poverty rate increased rapidly, from 13.8% in 2006 to 18.2% in 2010, reversing the declining trend of food poverty since 1996. With the increase in food prices and decline in income, food security increased, and the social impact of the financial crisis had a larger effect among the poorest and most vulnerable groups. Corn in Mexico As Mexico moves towards more open markets in agricultural trade, land, and water with NAFTA and the reprivatization of land, it faces an unknown economic future. == Food availability == The supply of available food energy in Mexico goes beyond the requirements, but a great number of people still suffer from food insecurities. Moreover, the probability of being food insecure has been reported to decrease with increasing income. Amartya Sen argues that ownership of food is one of the most primitive property rights. However, even when food supplies are sufficient, there can be food insecurity. Between 2003 and 2005, the total Mexican food supply was sufficient, averaging 3,270 kilocalories per daily capita, higher than the minimum requirements of 1,850 kilocalories per daily capita. The National Survey of Wholesale, Food and Nutritional Status in Rural Areas (ENAAEN) data gathered in 2008 for 90 rural areas found that more than 90% of localities in these areas sold foods such as dry beans, chick peas, dairy and meat, 86.7% sold vegetables, and 78.9% sold fruit. This data results in the conclusion that food availability is not the problem; rather, the issue of food insecurity is caused by an interplay of other factors. Furthermore, more than 18% of the Mexican population in 2008 was in food poverty with Chiapas, Guerrero, and Oaxaca being the states with the most severe food poverty, according to a CONEVAL analysis. The vulnerability and dependence on food price increases is higher for the lower income deciles. Rack with Mexican-brand snack food at a convenience store near Estadio Azteca in Mexico City According to Mexico's National Public Health Institute, few households meet what the guidelines for an adequate and diverse diet For indigenous populations, the problem is worse. Only 10% of the non-indigenous rural population and 3% of the rural indigenous population consume meat three or more days per week, pointing to the prevalence of anemia in the population. ===Dietary concerns=== In 2013, Mexico was ranked fourth globally and first in Latin America in per capita spending on ultra-processed foods and drinks. == Factors of food insecurity == === Malnutrition === Adequate nutrition and food are fundamental for human survival, health, and growth. Malnutrition contributes to maternal and infant mortality and morbidity and diminishes development. Childhood malnutrition could be pointed to as a consequence of inequity in the distribution of resources, services, wealth, and opportunities. In Mexico, although the prevalence of malnutrition has been decreasing, it continues to be a health issue where policies aimed at reducing food poverty have not been effective. 13.5% of children under five still suffer from chronic undernutrition and nearly 35 thousand have lost their lives because of this problem. Chronic malnutrition is much more prevalent in the south and rural areas than in the north and in urban ones. The indigenous population in Mexico faces a significantly more severe situation. For instance, over 33% of children under five suffer from chronic malnutrition, which trumps the national average. === Obesity === 450x450px Mexico has experienced a dramatic increase in wealth in recent decades, bringing a significant shift in socio-economic status and a geographical shift from rural to urban. This transformation has brought about harmful dietary patterns: increased access to low-priced highly energy-dense foods and an increase in sedentary behavior. As a result, Mexico is witnessing a rapidly growing epidemic of obesity and obesity related non-communicable diseases. The main factors to which the rise in obesity have been attributed to are the increase in the consumption of hyper-caloric foods that are rich in fat, salt, and sugar and poor in important nutrients such as vitamins, minerals, and fiber as well as the decrease in physical activity. The dramatic increase in obesity rates has resulted in higher rates of obesity-related diseases such as diabetes, hypertension, and acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and an increase in related healthcare costs. 32% of men and 26% of women were said to be of normal weight. It is estimated that by 2050, 12% of men and 9% of women will be of normal weight. Economically, this will be a large burden. It is estimated that a 1% reduction in BMI could save 43 million US$ in healthcare costs in 2020 and 85 million $US in 2050. Therefore, it is important that measures be taken for the prevention of obesity. ==Government efforts== In 1997, the Mexican government started a new program aimed at relieving extreme poverty in the country. Programa de Educación, Salud, y Alimenación (PROGRESA) was initially implemented for poor households in rural areas, but due to its success, it was expanded to urban areas in 2001. Around 2.6 million families participated by 2000, including a third of all rural families. The program involved a cash reward for families that undertook actions to improve the health and nutritional status of their household. The program was relatively successful: attendance in secondary school increased by more than 20% for girls and 10% for boys in PROGRESA households. The National Crusade against Hunger (CNCH) started in 2013 and was implemented by the federal government through the Secretariat of Social Development (SEDESOL). Its objective included \\"massively abolishing poverty, undernutrition, and food deprivation resulting from lack of access to food in Mexico.\\" According to the CONEVAL, the CNCH has reached 7.1 million Mexicans. It includes interventions run by 55 preexisting programs in the fields of health and nutrition services, food production and distribution, and social and educational development, among others. The two participants with the largest budgets in 2013 were the Opportunidades Program and the Ministry of Health. The CNCH campaign started in 400 municipalities with the highest numbers and percentages of people living in conditions of extreme poverty and food insecurity. Its initial three priorities were boosting food supply and provision actions, increasing the number of families with access to money transfers and food supplements, and increasing the capacity of the population for acquiring food.

He served there until April 1917, when the United States entered the war. Imbrie received the following medals for his wartime service—the Croix de Guerre, the White Rose Croix de Guerre, the Ambulance Medal, the Field Service Medal, and the Medal of Recognition for serving six months or more at the front.Field Service Bulletin, September 1, 1917, #9 notes Imbrie’s receiving the Croix de Guerre.

He arrived in November, 1917, in the midst of the Russian Revolution.Imbrie, \\"Report on the Petrograd Consulate, April 5 to September 1, 1918,\\" RG 59 123.813/7 ½ With the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk about to be signed, ending the war between Germany and Russia, the American legation moved north in late February, 1918.

Instead, he was assigned to Constantinople under Admiral Mark Bristol, who headed the U.S. military and diplomatic missions in Turkey.Charles Allen to Secretary of State, December 6, 1920, Box 1448, 123 Im ¼. After traveling extensively throughout the region doing reconnaissance, Imbrie left Turkey in July, 1921. Returning to Turkey in March, 1922, Imbrie became the only U.S. official observer in Angora (Ankara), the seat of the new government of modern Turkey. There he met Katherine Helene Gillespie (1883–1968), an American relief worker caring for orphans of war and genocide. They married on December 26, 1922.\\"Wedded in Constantinople: Miss Gillespie Relief Worker, Bride of Robert Imbrie of Baltimore,\\" New York Times, December 31, 1922, 2.

The episode aired on March 7, 2016 on AMC in the United States. Outside of the United States, the episode premiered on Netflix in several countries. ==Plot== ===Opening=== In a preview of events that take place later in the episode, Mike returns home to rest after having been in a fight. He tosses a stack of hundred-dollar bills onto his kitchen table, pulls a bag of frozen vegetables out of his freezer and presses it to his face. He sinks into a chair, his eye swollen shut and his face gruesomely beaten. ===Main story=== Despite Jimmy's assertion that his commercial to recruit clients for the Sandpiper Crossing lawsuit was a success, the partners at Davis & Main lambaste him for airing it without their consent. Even though the majority of the partners want to fire Jimmy for cause, Cliff decides to give him a second chance with the understanding that he'll be under a great deal more scrutiny going forward. Jimmy leaves Kim an urgent voicemail requesting that she call him before speaking to Howard. Jimmy's too late because Kim is already being grilled by Howard and Chuck at the HHM offices over her failure to warn them about Jimmy's ad. Not wanting to get Jimmy into even more trouble, she takes responsibility for not letting them know in advance that the commercial would air, explaining that she didn't think it was necessary. A furious Howard reprimands her, and she promises it won't happen again. Later on, Jimmy drives to Chuck's house and starts to enter, but realizes he forgot to remove his electronics, so he grudgingly turns back to Chuck's mailbox and empties his pockets. When Chuck doesn't answer, Jimmy uses his key to enter. He finds Chuck shivering on the couch, still dressed to leave for work but covered by a space blanket. Chuck refuses to go to the hospital, so Jimmy wraps him in a second space blanket, then sits to wait with him. The next morning, Jimmy condemns Chuck for allowing Howard to reprimand Kim, saying he believes Chuck could have come to Kim's defense but did not to because he doesn't want Jimmy to be a lawyer. Chuck refuses to intercede for Kim, telling Jimmy that he causes harm to everyone around him, but cannot admit his own mistakes or wrongdoing. He says Jimmy is like \\"an alcoholic who refuses to admit he's got a problem\\". Jimmy offers to quit practicing law if Chuck will help Kim, but Chuck tells Jimmy he already made enough mistakes to get himself fired. Finding that Chuck cannot be persuaded, Jimmy storms out. Nacho and Mike monitor a small Mexican restaurant. Nacho tells Mike he and Tuco meet at this location regularly to settle accounts with their dealers and it would be easy to kill Tuco as he enters or exits. Mike refuses to kill Tuco, asserting that it would attract retaliation by the Salamancas and the cartel. Instead, Mike plans to remove Tuco from an active role in the Salamanca drug business, which will satisfy Nacho's needs. Mike calls the police, fakes a minor accident in the restaurant parking lot which involves his car and Tuco's, and then goads Tuco into striking him repeatedly just as the police arrive. Because Tuco was carrying a gun when he beat Mike, he is arrested for assault with a deadly weapon. Tuco is taken away in handcuffs and Nacho later pays Mike, but Mike declines to give a reason for going to such trouble to avoid killing Tuco. ==Reception== ===Ratings=== Upon airing, the episode received 2.20 million American viewers, and an 18–49 rating of 0.9. ===Critical reception=== The episode received critical acclaim from critics.

Antiquities are terracotta sculptures of Gupta and Gupta era. The average height of the sculptures is 0.061 m, and most of them are allopenic Manasa bust female figures. The terracotta sculptures found here brought the high-profile history of classical art practice to Pundravardhana in the Gupta era. There was no significant source of stone in the Bengali region. So the artist took the stone as a substitute for the terracotta medium, and created all the artefacts of blacksmiths with extraordinary artistic skills. In many cases it has crossed the art of stone sculpture Shushma.

However, the definition depends on the perspective of different research areas through which it is examined, mainly monetary economics, international finance, corporate finance, and others (e.g. public economics, international trade, asset pricing, and labor economics). The WTO defines economic transparency as a “degree to which trade policies and practices, and the process by which they are established, are open and predictable.” (WTO’s 2014 glossary). United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD, 2012) relates to transparency as to “a state of affairs in which the participants in the investment process are able to obtain sufficient information from each other in order to make informed decisions and meet obligations and commitments”. According to the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) there are three main branches: transparency in economic policy, in the institutional structures surrounding the markets, and in the corporate sector. Since financial crises in emerging market economies in the 1990s, the Asian financial crises in 1997-1998 among them, weakness of institutions, lack of transparency in actual balance-sheets of firms, unintelligible corporate structures, and incomprehensible financial markets have revealed as a fundamental issue. The following corporate fraud scandals in the United States and Europe (e.g. Enron, Tyco, WorldCom) in the early 2000s amplified the importance of this issue even more. Finally, the financial collapse of renowned industries provoked demands for greater transparency to help improve corporate governance in the United States and other industrialized countries. Fiscal transparency is perceived to be essential for informed decision making, for guaranteeing some accountability, and for maintaining fiscal discipline. Central banks differ considerably in the ways in which they have become more transparent. The Bank of England has been a leading example in this regard. ==Role of asymmetric information== So to consider the need for economic transparency, an asymmetrical distribution of information between different economic agents has to occur. Full transparency may not necessarily mean that all information is complete and publicly accessible, but that there is no asymmetry in distributing private information between those economic actors. Increasing transparency contributes to the reduction of information asymmetries. Transparency concerning quality and intent (or effort) is sometimes referred to as ” ex-ante transparency“ (associated with predictability) whereby ” ex-post transparency“ means transparency of outcomes (associated with accountability). Two main types of problems resulting from asymmetries are adverse selection and moral hazard problems. The distinction between those two is based on timing: adverse selection regards behavior before a contract takes place whereas moral hazard describes a party’s action after the contract had already been made. The former is a consequence of a lack of information about quality. Varying knowledge of the quality of a product in the goods and services industry is referenced by the „lemons“ problem or described by the situation of both informed and uninformed investors participating in the financial markets. Another example from the labor market is the employer’s paucity of insight into the true prospective employee ‘s abilities. Moral hazard problems occur because of a shortage of information about intent. Then one party might engage in risky behavior or deceiving actions due to the lack of transparency (e.g. insured drivers acting riskier in the traffic). There is one additional problem arising from information asymmetry in information about scarcity of resources. Lack of transparency of prices causes an inefficient allocation of scarce resources. ==Application in a principal-agent relationship== A principal-agent relationship is one that agent acts on behalf of the principal. By the reason of different individual objectives, the principle demands the disclosure of information about effort and outcome to assure the agent does not act purely in their own interest. The application of transparency underlying the relationship between employer and employee, investor and firm (owner and manager) or the public and the government has two main objectives: predictability and accountability. Based on information about policy choices (“effort”) and the result (“outcome”) of the government’s (agent’s) decisions the public (”principal“) decides whether to keep or remove them from office. In public policy area the stress is on the “ex-post transparency” in the way that it improves the electorate’s ability to hold the government accountable. “Ex-ante” transparency is not very effective in assessing the government’s actions because the electorate is not familiar with what the optimal policy decisions should be. ==Cost-benefit analysis of transparency== Increased transparency can improve an efficient allocation of resources, make governments more accountable, undermine the power of special interests, and thus lead to improved policies and institutions (Glennerster and Shin, 2008, p. 184). Furthermore, ”as improved transparency raises efficiency (especially the efficiency of investment in new technology), it has the potential to raise growth” (Forssbaeck and Oxelheim, 2015, p. 17). It also decreases a firm’s or state’s cost of capital. This has been studied on investing behavior in emerging markets. Whenever there was insufficient transparency and negative information appeared, investors could not distinguish between individual firms and borrowers, thus they departed investments from the entire market. This explanation is also applicable to the 2008 global financial crisis. Banks did not have enough information on their partners’ solvency which led to the collapse of the interbank market. In conclusion, countries and companies with transparent policies have lower borrowing costs, get more investment, and are less susceptible to financial crises. Increasing transparency has many benefits as already stated, but also many costs. The expenses on the supplier‘s/sender’s side are based on production and dissemination. Likewise important are indirect costs of revealing strategic information. On one hand, this allows firms access to their competitors' know-how, thus increasing efficiency and growth in the entire industry. On the other, it implicates loss of competitive advantage and bargaining power which discourages firms to invest in research. Disclosing information might reduce information asymmetries between investors but may reveal sensitive information to rivals. Another example are privacy or integrity costs to the sender. Information like a genetic predisposition for a disease or medical information on family members if provided to insurance companies would streamline the pricing of insurance. However, for many disclosing this type of information would just not be tolerable. Besides these costs, there are so-called incentive effects. If the incentive for the sender is based on the results of (involuntary) monitoring, they make costly actions to (deceitfully) signal abilities. A perfect example of this are CEO compensations derived from the stock value which is impacted by the firm’s signaled ability. Unnecessary expenses of exaggerated signaling eventually lead to reducing the firm’s value. It can be also applicable to government officials’ intentions to signal abilities using public resources. The receiver/demander needs to process the content of the information which is also costly (proportionately to the preciseness of the information). Research shows that the marginal benefit of increasing transparency is decreasing. Leuz and Verrecchia (2000) discovered that if transparency reaches a certain point, further disclosure of information has little power on decreasing the firm’s cost of capital. In agreement with that, Plummer and Tafti found that the third world countries, where transparency tends to be underdeveloped, have most to benefit by increasing policy transparency. Some even suggest the marginal benefit is negative beyond a certain point. If imprecise, sharing too much information with the public might cause inefficiency. Let’s say a public body (e.g. a central bank) reveals uncertainty in future decision-making related to a certain commodity. (e.g. interest). The private sector overreacts and volatility in the market for this commodity escalates (Geraats, 2002). ==Socio-economic transparency mechanisms== For economic transparency to remedy the asymmetricity, there has to some mechanism for information to be transferred from ”the sender“ (the informed) to ”the receiver“ (the uninformed). Since transparency has a demand- side as well, to increase it the information has to be relevant to the receiver’s decision making. To improve the freedom of choice these mechanisms signal the implications of one’s socioeconomic choices. There are again two engaging parties: the reporter who enters the information into the instrument and the inquirer who searches for information related to socio-economical choices. Examples: *publicly available product tests by consumer safety groups *nutrition information printed on food products (sometimes enforced by official regulations) *labels, established by governmental or non-governmental organizations (indicating certain “organic” production methods or “fair” salary conditions for producers) *consumer ratings and reviews on web shops (amazon.com) *salary comparison web sites (glassdoor.com.) *classified information disclosing anonymous platforms (wikileaks.org) All of these mechanisms face the following challenges: *language - standardized and consensual meaning (e.g. to which companies, people labels in reports relate to in reality) *inference - ability to filter out and interpret the relevant information for it to be able to satisfy the inquiry (the internet being a typical example of a non-infering mechanism) *privacy/anonymity - using middlemen (people or platforms such as wikileaks.org) to keep a reporter's identity private if required *truth/gaming - dealing with some reporters attempting to game the mechanism or unintentionally entering wrong information (e.g. sending many fake positive reviews to improve the average rating), one of useful tools to overcome this is displaying any discrepancies in input information (in case of one-dimensional product ratings showing the minimum and maximum) or using trustworthiness ratings of reporters ==The US's perspective== Transparency and openness can help accelerate reforms in developing countries in situations which foreign aid and other US programmatic and diplomatic efforts will have less potency and influence. It can promote responsible practices that directly and indirectly support a broad range of US policy objectives, such as (1) exposing government corruption, (2) reducing the scope for government revenues to be siphoned offshore, (3) increasing collection of domestic tax revenues, (4) increasing the accountability and effectiveness of government spending (including aid), (5) reducing dependency on foreign aid, and (6) helping to prevent money laundering and terrorist finance. == References == Category:Transparency (behavior) Category:Accountability Category:Anti-corruption measures ","title":"Economic transparency"},{"id":"56633205","text":" Eliza was a French prize that made nine voyages as a whaler between 1802 and 1822.

The senses usually employed in multisensory learning are visual, auditory, kinesthetic, and tactile – VAKT (i.e. seeing, hearing, doing, and touching). Other senses might include smell, taste and balance (e.g. making vegetable soup or riding a bicycle). Multisensory learning is different from learning styles which is the assumption that people can be classified according to their learning style (audio, visual or kinesthetic). However, critics of learning styles say there is no consistent evidence that identifying an individual student's learning style and teaching for that style will produce better outcomes. Consequently, learning styles has not received widespread support from scientists, nor has it proven to be effective in the classroom. For more on this see learning styles. Reports suggest the human brain has evolved to process multisensory signals, making it is more natural than unisensory processing. Recent research has made clear that multisensory processing of information is part of daily life, whereby the brain integrates the information from different modalities (senses) into a coherent mental perception. Some studies conclude that the benefits of multisensory learning are greatest if the senses are engaged concurrently (see Multisensory integration) and the instruction is direct (explicit) and systematic (see ). However, some neurologists question whether more is \\"actually better for learners who are struggling\\". The rational is that learners with developmental disorders may have impairments in cognitive control, planning and attention, so multisensory integration might place additional demands on systems that are already straining. Consequentially, it is suggested, it may be better to narrow the alternatives to one that works. Reading at the Speed of Light: How we Read, why so many can't, and what can be done about it, 2017, page 303, Mark Seidenberg Other studies suggest that multisensory integration only develops optimally by middle childhood (i.e. eight years of age or older). Max Planck Institute for Biological Cybernetics, Spemannstr. 41, 72076 Tübingen, Germany According to the U.K. Independent review of the teaching of early reading (Rose Report 2006) multisensory learning is also effective because it keeps students more engaged in their learning. In 2010 the U.K. Department for Education established the core criteria for programs that teach school children to read by using systematic Synthetic phonics. It includes a requirement that the material \\"uses a multi- sensory approach so that children learn variously from simultaneous visual, auditory and kinaesthetic activities which are designed to secure essential phonic knowledge and skills\\". The following organizations recommend multisensory instruction for learners with a learning disability: The International Dyslexia Association (IDA) and the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHHD). And one study says there is strong support for using multisensory experiences to increase the focus of students with special needs. One of the oldest proponents of multisensory phonics for remedial reading instruction is Orton-Gillingham, dating back to 1935. What Works Clearinghouse, a part of the Institute of Education Sciences reports there is a lack of studies meeting its strict evidence standards so it is \\"unable to draw any conclusions about the effectiveness or ineffectiveness of unbranded Orton-Gillingham–based strategies for students with learning disabilities\\". However, Best Evidence Encyclopedia , a part of Johns Hopkins School of Education found one qualifying study that showed an effect size of +0.43. ==See also== * Cognitive psychology * Crossmodal * e-learning (theory)the cognitive science principles of effective multimedia learning using electronic educational technology * Multimodality * National Reading Panel * Sensory processing * Sensory processing disorder * == References == Category:Learning Category:Senses ","title":"Multisensory learning"},{"id":"56633521","text":"Gastón Rodríguez Maeso (born 23 March 1992) is a Uruguayan footballer who plays for Avaí, on loan from Racing.Profile at Soccerway ==Club career== Gastón started playing football at Club 3 de Abril.

The spruce stands for the largest proportion of the wooded floor are 26.0 percent, followed by the pines at 22.9 percent, the beech at 15.8 percent and the oak at 10.6 percent. Common tree species in the German forests are also the hanging birch (Betula pendula), the common ash (Fraxinus excelsior), the black alder (Alnus glutinosa), the European larch (Larix decidua), the common Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) and the sycamore maple (Acer pseudoplatanus). ==Forest modification and tree species change== Wind throw in a spruce tree By nature, the German forest would be strongly influenced by deciduous trees, in particular red beech (Fagus sylvatica). Today's tree species composition with high proportions of coniferous trees reflects the forest use of the past centuries. From the Middle Ages to the early 19th century, many forests in Germany were over-used or beaten to pieces. In order to avert an imminent wood problem, these devastated forests and areas were reforested in the context of sustainable forestry on the better soils with good water supply often with common spruce (Picea abies) and on the nutrient- poorer and drier locations with pine (Pinus sylvestris).BMEL (ed.): The Forest in Germany - Selected Results of the Third Federal Forest Inventory, p. 5. These two robust tree species are better able to cope with the difficult ecological conditions on clear-cutting land than frost-sensitive tree species such as European beech and white fir (Abies alba) and also provide high timber yields. Even during and after the two world wars caused by the destruction of the war, the Reparationshiebe and the wood requirements for the reconstruction large Kahlflächen on which often pure populations of spruce and pine were established. The forest owners and foresters of the time provided a great cultural achievement with the reconstruction of the forests - given the large areas and limited resources available.BMEL (ed.): The Forest in Germany - Selected Results of the Third Federal Forest Inventory, p. 5. == See also == * German Forest * History of the forest in Central Europe ==References== Category:Forests and woodlands of Germany Category:Geography of Germany ","title":"Forest in Germany"},{"id":"56633577","text":"Trace is the name of: * Trace Adkins (born 1962), American country singer, songwriter, and actor * Trace Armstrong (born 1965), American former American football defensive end * Trace Balla, Australian children's writer and illustrator * Trace Beaulieu (born 1958), American puppeteer, writer, and actor * Trace Bundy, instrumental acoustic guitar player who lives and performs in Boulder, Colorado * Trace Coquillette (born 1974), retired Major League Baseball third baseman and second baseman * Trace Cyrus (born 1989), American musician * Trace DeMeyer (born 1956), multi-genre author, artist, poet and journalist of Shawnee-Cherokee descent * Trace Gallagher (born 1961), American journalist and television news anchor for Fox News Channel * Trace Lysette, American actress * Trace McSorley (born 1995), American football quarterback * Al Trace (1900–1993), American songwriter and orchestra leader * Arther Trace (1926–2005), American author, critic and educational reformer * Arthur Trace (born 1979), American magician * Ben Trace (1890–1976), American songwriter * Christopher Trace (1933–1992), English actor and television presenter ==See also== *Trayce, given name ","title":"Trace (name)"},{"id":"56633595","text":"Kengulabi () is an upcoming Indian Kannada-language female oriented Film directed by Srisha (Sridhar Javur).

He was then appointed to the more important court of Hyderabad State from 1810 until 1820, when he retired to England. Russell was Private Secretary and assistant to James Achilles Kirkpatrick, British Resident at Hyderabad from 1798 until his death in 1805. Russell's career is discussed in some detail in William Dalrymple's 2002 history of British India, White Mughals, where he figures as a gifted but weak diplomat who, following the death of his superior, Kirkpatrick, seduced then abandoned Kirkpatrick's widow. Russell resigned the Residency in 1820 to avert an investigation for corruption which would have led to his removal from office in disgrace. On an annual salary of £3,400, he had managed to accumulate a fortune of £85,000 over 10 years. In retirement he lived first at Sutton Park in Bedfordshire, then at Southernhay House, an architecturally notable listed building in Exeter. It was a newly built, freestanding, classical mansion of pillared grandeur. ==Marriages and Children== In October 1808 he married Jane Amelia Casamajor in Madras who died suddenly just two months later. A subsequent liaison with a local lady resulted in the birth of his daughter, who he named Mary Wilson in 1815. This child was brought to England when he retired, and was brought up in complete secrecy, with Sir Henry's friend, Major Robert Pitman, acting as go-between. He provided an allowance for her, but refused to let Major Pitman tell her the identity of her father. https://www.ourmigrationstory.org.uk/uploads/Correspondence%20between%20Sir%20Henry%20Russell%20(1783-1852)%20Major%20Robert%20Pitman%20and%20Mary%20Wilson.pdf.

They were covered in NME soon after (8 May 1982 issue), the journalist comparing their music to Pigbag, Bow Wow Wow and Adam and the Ants.

She is the lead for York University's ATLAS experiment group. == Education == Taylor graduated from the University of British Columbia with Bachelors of Science in Physics in 1991. As an undergraduate, she worked at TRIUMF, working on rare kaon decay. She completed her graduate studies at the University of Toronto, where she earned a PhD under the supervision of Pekka Sinervo in 1999. She worked on fragmentation properties of the bottom quark. She worked at Stony Brook University as a postdoctoral fellow. She worked on Fermilab's D0 experiment, building electronics to detect bottom quark particles in real time. == Research == Taylor's research focuses on the magnetic monopole. To do this, she is using the ATLAS detector at CERN. Her lab concentrated on the development of firmware for the transition radiation tracker within the ATLAS experiment. She is motivated by predictions from Grand Unified Theory, the observation of quantised charge and potential to reinforce the symmetry in Maxwell's equations. Fermilab's Tevatron Accelerator Taylor spent five years working at the Tevatron particle accelerator. She was concerned when it lost government funding in 2011. Whilst working at the Fermilab Tevatron particle accelerator, Taylor identified CP violation in the decay of bottom quarks, which could contribute to the dominance of matter in the universe. The rate at which she detected CP violation was two-orders of magnitude larger than that predicted by the Standard Model of particle physics. She joined York University in 2004, where she was one of two women in the department. She held a Canada Research Chair between 2004 and 2014. Taylor is a member of the American Physical Society and the Particle Physics Division of the Canadian Association of Physicists. ==References== Category:Living people Category:Particle physicists Category:Experimental physicists Category:Canadian physicists Category:University of British Columbia alumni Category:University of Toronto alumni Category:Canadian women physicists Category:York University faculty Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Wendy Taylor (physicist)"},{"id":"56633724","text":"Battle of Rhodes can refer to several battles and sieges throughout history. * Battle of Rhodes (1912), Italian capture of the island during the Italo- Turkish War * Battle of Rhodes (1943), German invasion during World War II. * Siege of Rhodes (305–304 BC), by Demetrius I of Macedon * Hospitaller conquest of Rhodes (1306–1310) * Siege of Rhodes (1444), unsuccessful attempt by the Mamluks under Aynal Gecut to expel the Knights Hospitaller from the island * Siege of Rhodes (1480), first, unsuccessful attempt by the Ottoman Empire to expel the Knights Hospitaller from the island * Siege of Rhodes (1522), second, successful attempt by the Ottoman Empire to expel the Knights Hospitaller from the island ","title":"Battle of Rhodes"},{"id":"56633738","text":"Agnes Reisch (born 11 October 1999) is a German ski jumper..

However, the most comprehensive database of VOC voyages has no record of a Leuve, or even of a Leuuw (the Dutch word for lion) fitting the dates and circumstances.

The 1797 volume of Lloyd's Register shows her owner as Calvert & Co. Lion sailed on 3 April 1796 to India for the EIC. It is not clear who her captain was. Lloyd's Register showed it as Thompson, but an account of her loss gave it as Sever. Lion was at Delagoa Bay in late June 1798, having put in in distress as she was returning to England from Madras and Colombo. There, on 28 June 1798, Captain Sever chartered three whalers, , Kerr, master, and two other English ships, London, Keen, master, and , Hopper, master, to carry Lions cargo back to England.

Their first projects were Zonotope™ and the noise music project Diane Kensington Devotional Band. They began performing under the alias Jerry Paper in 2012, releasing their latest album, Abracadabra via Stones Throw Records in 2020. ==Early life== Nathan said that as a child, they were influenced to learn music by the fact that \\"all [their] friends were making music.\\" They learned how to play \\"The Simpsons Theme\\" on the piano when they were five, played bongos for their school band, and were a drummer. Shortly after they learned how to play the Misfits song \\"London Dungeon\\" on bass guitar in eighth grade, they made psychedelic folk recordings in their bedroom with Sony Acid and performed in various bands at school. The first group they were in was a comedy rock band named The Corrupt Ice Cream Vendors. They got into several noise and psychedelic acts like Growing and Devendra Banhart in their teen years after being exposed to them via the magazine Arthur, and later got into free jazz and krautrock. Nathan originally wanted to perform in the \\"cool band[s]\\" that they saw at school and at their summer camps, but they were turned down by all of them due to their \\"nerdy\\" looks, which influenced them to become a solo artist. ==Career== ===2009–2012: Zonotope™ and Diane Kensington Devotional Band=== Nathan stated that as a \\"pretentious teenager\\", they \\"refused to listen to anything that wasn't 1966 to 1968.\\" Therefore, it was \\"part of [their] personality\\" that they despised electronic music. By the time they were experimenting with their friend's Roland HS-60 synthesizer, however, Nathan reports in an interview that they were fascinated by the sounds it produced. This inspired them to make electronic music as a way of taking the \\"challenge\\" of \\"find[ing] a way to like\\" the genre.

In doing so, it uses synthesized replications of acoustic instruments, such as a square wave keyboard sound meant to be a harpsichord texture. According to The Fader, the use of these sounds gives the album a more \\"uncanny\\" vibe than Nathan's previous releases. ===2015–present=== The same palette of instruments were later used on their next album Carousel (2015). For making Carousel, Nathan wrote the songs in the same manner as for their previous release; however, the analog keyboard Nathan usually used for creating their music had broke, meaning they had to rely on digital synthesizer sounds for Carousel. they said the album consisted of a bunch of \\"hilarious sounds.\\" As they described making the LP's lead single, \\"I was just trying to come up with the funniest sounds to go together – like tubular bells, and standup bass, and harpsichord, and then it goes into disco funk.\\" Toon Time Raw! was recorded with the band BadBadNotGood at their studio in Toronto.

The record was performed with a record release party on June 19, 2016 at Brooklyn's art gallery place Secret Project Robot. It was Nathan's first headlining performance that they performed with a backing band, a contrast from their previous live performances where they sang with machines performing the backing tracks. As Madison Bloom of Audiofemme covered the event, \\"it was an evening of undeniably odd birds, but what a wonderful thing to see when so many modern bands are required to be ultra slick and fronted by supermodels,\\" and the band's setup had \\"great versatility via keyboards, guitar, pedal effects, and flute.\\" On September 15, 2017, American rapper Kari Faux released \\"Gotta Know,\\" a track from her extended play Primary.

According to the Stones Throw Records website, the album delves into existential topics pertaining to \\"the endless human cycle of desire and satisfaction\\".. On May 15, 2020 Nathan released a new album titled Abracadabra. The song \\"Quicksand\\" was teased first while \\"Puppeteer\\" and \\"Cholla\\" were released on their Bandacamp profile and Spotify. ==Musical style and philosophies== During their teen years living in Los Angeles, Nathan visited several Scientology and Mormon centers. It was during this time that they got into direct experience, the idea that language cannot clearly state what someone gains via sensory perception. This, as well as their love for the \\"ritual\\" of religion, would later become the basis of how they develop their music: \\"Musical sounds act as symbols, but they carry information that can bypass linguistic processing. That was my main focus. I wanted to investigate that freaky idea.\\" They explained that \\"instead of trying to explain mystical experience,\\" they \\"try to create a context and a vocabulary that maybe gets at [a philosophy] slightly more.\\" Nathan is into the idea of fuzzy logic, or what goes on between the binary numbers of zero and one. Their Diane Kensington project and the title track of the Jerry Paper album Fuzzy Logic are based on the concept. As they opined, \\"Binaries are a very helpful way to deal with things. They’re a pretty good tool when it comes to categorizing the world and figuring things out. But it’s not actually how the world works.\\" Another primary purpose for Nathan making music is to keep \\"put[ting] [them]self in uncomfortable situations.\\" Nathan's reason for producing and performing music under alter egos like Jerry Paper is that they help them figure out more about their actual self: The works of Henry Cowell (pictured) inspired Nathan to play with the limitations of pop music. Nathan stated in an interview with The Editorial Magazine that they feel machines are just as human as actual human beings due to having \\"a lot of quirks.\\"Mallet, Whitney. \\"Jerry Paper\\". The Editorial Magazine. Retrieved December 17, 2017. This translates into Nathan's musical style, which Bloom described as \\"genre- less\\" but compared to Daft Punk in that it combines the \\"coldness of technology with the foolproof warmth of human music.\\" Nathan explains that musically, their works play around with the limitations of pop music. This limitation aspect of their works was inspired by the piano-only works of Henry Cowell: \\"He has that piece, \\"The Banshee,\\" where he’s scraping his finger nails on the piano strings. Fucking incredible. He used the piano in a different way.\\" This is why, until Toon Time Raw!, they didn't use MIDI software because they would've otherwise \\"ha[d] a huge amount of choices.\\" ===Music production=== Nathan spends most of their home time recording in their bedroom, which consists of only one mattress and two cardboard boxes that serve as their \\"closet.\\" As they explained, they get \\"static anxiety\\" to finish a project once they start work on it: \\"I’d have to say that in each song I write, I have fun for maybe 10 minutes max out of the who-knows-how- many hours I put in. The motivation is not the pleasure of doing but the satisfaction of finishing.\\" The drum machines they use varies from album to album, although there have been certain machines they have used consistently since they started their Jerry Paper project such as Taal Tarang Digital kicks and Roland TR-727 percussion. They also avoid using loops or repeated parts in their works: \\"I feel like setting that limitation for myself makes me write and record different kind of songs than those I’d write if they were based on loops.\\" ==Themes== Nathan, in both their songs and the music videos for them, takes on comic views of real life because, in their words, the \\"world isn’t so serious.\\" All of Nathan's music attempts to get a view of alternate universes, and \\"because I feel that music isn’t really the arena for truth, I often write lyrics focusing on the irrational,\\" they said. In terms of live stage performances, Nathan dances in comic yet profound routines and delivers, in a deadpan tone, indifferent aphorisms that are also in the lyrics of their songs. As they said while performing live at their release party for Toon Time Raw!, “It’s great to be alive. But having a body is sooo annoying. But you are a body, so…fuck it.\\" A common major theme in Nathan's records is anxieties, how they \\"feel very immediate and true in the moment but in hindsight often register as products of absurd logic.\\" The lyrics of their works represent feelings of hopelessness and concern of where to go in life in the future, which are translated \\"into a subtly self-aware revision of easy listening,\\" Decoder analyzed. As Bloom stated, \\"Though wearing the guise of empathetic AI and employing tools of the Muzak genre such as keyboard saxophone and elevator synths, they manages to make sincere, and more importantly good music that is relatable to humans and algorithms alike.\\" ==Personal life== Born and raised in Los Angeles, Nathan went to Manhattan when he began attending The New School in 2008 to study sociomusicology and philosophy of religion. He lived in Brooklyn as of 2014, but relocated back to California in 2016. He is married. ==Discography== ===As Jerry Paper=== ==== Studio albums ==== { class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" + List of studio albums with details - ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:12em;\\"Title ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:20em;\\" Album details - ! scope=\\"row\\"Vol. I  * Released: January 25, 2012 (Worldwide)\\"Vol. I\\".

They are self-governing possessions of the Crown (defined uniquely in each jurisdiction). Internationally, the dependencies are considered \\"territories for which the United Kingdom is responsible\\", rather than sovereign states. ==Bailiwick of Guernsey== Prostitution in Guernsey is legal, but related activities such as solicitation and brothel keeping are prohibited. ===History=== At the end of the 19th century prostitution was common in Guernsey, especially in St Peter Port where around 500 soldiers were garrisoned. A large number of the prostitutes were French. The military authorities were concerned about the high rate of STIs amongst the soldiers. The Committee of the Council for the Affairs of Guernsey and Jersey reported in 1897: \\"Secret Diseases, not unfrequently [sic] introduced by foreign prostitutes would appear to be prevalent in that Island [ie Guernsey] . . . such diseases sap the foundation of public health and affect injuriously not only those who by their own misconduct have incurred them, but even generations yet unborn . . .\\" This report eventually led to the passing of la Loi Rélative aux Maladies Secrètes in 1912. This law provided for compulsory medical examination and detention in hospital if infected, and also the expulsion of foreign prostitutes. This law was repealed by The Venereal Diseases Ordinance (1912) Repeal Ordinance, 1949. However, due to the wording of the 1949 act, the 1912 law is arguably still in force in Alderney. In 2005 an East European prostitution ring was thought to be operating on the island. ==Bailiwick of Jersey== Prostitution in Jersey is legal, but related activities such as keeping a brothel are outlawed. Following a consultation period from 1 September 2017 and 13 October 2017, the Home Affairs Minister approved a new draft Sexual Offences (Jersey) Law to be debated in the Assembly of the States of Jersey. The draft law does not criminalise prostitution, but consolidates previous legislation on related activities. In 2015 it was estimated there were 35–40 prostitutes in Jersey. Most visit the island for short periods and work from hotels. ===History=== In the 19th century, prostitution was common. French women came over to the island to service the needs of the soldiers stationed on the island and sailors in the port. The road that led from the barracks to the port, Pier Road, had many brothels and, after dark, women solicited in the road. In 1846, George Le Cronier, the Centenier of Saint Helier, decided to clean up the island. He visited one of the houses of ill-repute, \\"Mulberry Cottage\\" on Patriotic Street, and arrested 11 prostitutes who worked there. The following week he returned to the house with the intent of arresting the master and mistress of the house. On entering the house he was stabbed in the stomach by the mistress Marie Le Gendre. Le Cronier died the next day and Le Gendre transported to Australia for life. At the end of the 19th century, police would accompany gentlemen to brothels and, for a fee, ensure no legal action was taken against them. Prostitutes were using hotels and restaurants to find customers by 1910. In the 1930s, Sand Street was where street prostitutes worked and there was a well known brothel, the \\"Striped Monkey\\", on Cross Street. During the German occupation of the island in 1940, all sexual contact between the German soldiers and the islanders was prohibited. To stop any \\"illegal\\" prostitution, the German authorities set up a brothel in the \\"Maison de Victor Hugo\\" hotel. Syphilis was a problem amongst the soldiers and a specialist clinic was set up in the \\"Merton Hotel\\". ==Isle of Man== Prostitution in the Isle of Man is legal but related activities such as soliciting, procuring and brothel keeping are prohibited by the Sexual Offences Act 1992. There are few prostitutes permanently on the Isle of Man, most visiting the island on short term \\"tours\\". A man and a woman were arrested on suspicion of committing prostitution offences in Douglas in 2013. A police spokesman said this was \\"an unusual and rare incident.\\" ==References== Category:British Crown Dependencies society Crown dependencies ","title":"Prostitution in the Crown dependencies"},{"id":"56633909","text":"is a male Japanese former international table tennis player.

The plant is operated by Luminant, a subsidiary of Vistra Energy. It began operations in 2010. ==History== Plans for Oak Grove began in the 1970s as Texas Power & Light (a forerunner of Luminant) and Alcoa made an agreement to jointly operate a power plant named Twin Oak Steam Electric Station in Robertson County. The plan was to construct two, 750 MW units to burn lignite and be ready for commercial generation by 1981. The electricity generated would run to Alcoa's aluminium smelting facility in Palestine, Texas. Twin Oaks Reservoir was developed by impounding Duck Creek in 1982 to act as a cooling source for the plant. In 1983, Alcoa attempted to sell its stake in Twin Oak to Halliburton who was seeking electricity to offer to the owners of the troubled South Texas Nuclear Generating Station. Ultimately, Alcoa sold its stake back to Texas Utilities in 1984. As electricity demand in Texas stagnated, construction on Twin Oak continued to be deferred until the air permit was withdrawn in 1994. The plant was renamed from Twin Oak to Oak Grove when construction restarted in 2007 by Luminant. Construction resumed in order to meet future electricity demand and following the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) granting Luminant a new air permit for Oak Grove. The plant was reconfigured and redesigned to meet current emissions requirements. This included the addition of selective catalytic reduction (SCR) systems to reduce nitrogen oxide () emissions and activated carbon which prevents mercury from being released. After Fluor completed the necessary construction work, Unit 1 came online in December 2009 and Unit 2 came online in June 2010. Oak Grove utilizes lignite exacted from the nearby Kosse Mine. ==See also== * List of power stations in Texas * List of largest power stations in the United States ==References== ==External links== *Luminant page for Oak Grove Power Plant Category:Energy infrastructure completed in 2009 Category:Energy infrastructure completed in 2010 Category:Coal-fired power stations in Texas Category:Buildings and structures in Robertson County, Texas ","title":"Oak Grove Power Plant"},{"id":"56634005","text":"Imogen Ruth Coe (born 30 November 1962) is a British-born biochemist.

The protests started on 4 February, and calmed down the next day. However, protests flared up again on 19 February, where 3 members of the security forces were killed after being run over by a bus. ==Background== The Gonabadi Dervishes are Sufi Muslims; the Iranian government considers them a threat. Conversion to Sufism is frowned upon by the Shi'a religious establishment. In January, at least 10 of the group's members were imprisoned in Fars province, and others may be held at Evin Prison in Tehran. ==Protests== On 19 February, the Sufis organized a sit- in protest at a police station, located in the Pasdaran district of Tehran, where one of their members was held. Later, clashes broke out between the Sufi protestors and security forces. Police used tear gas in an attempt to disperse the protesters. Five riot police were killed. According to the Iranian press, police arrested around 300 people, and there have been reports that some of the protesters may have been killed. However, the Sufi dervishes gathered around the home of their 90-year-old leader Noor Ali Tabandeh to protect him from arrest. In the aftermath of the 19 February, protests, footage emerged that showed several Sufi protesters who were arrested, being tortured by government forces.

The House is often credited as starting the house system in ball culture for homeless LGBTQ youth, she became a mother figure giving love, support and relief while also confidence for the ballroom and outside world. ==Career== LaBeija originally worked and competed on the Manhattan drag circuit under the name of Crystal LaAsia, before changing her name to LaBeija as Latin queens kept calling her La Belleza (Spanish for \\"the beauty\\"). In the 1960s and 1970s, drag queens of color were expected to whiten their appearance to help their chances at winning competitions and they often faced racist environments. LaBeija was one of only a few African American drag queens to be awarded a \\"Queen of the Ball\\" title at a drag ball organized by whites during this era. In 1967, she was crowned Miss Manhattan. LaBeija subsequently competed in the 1967 Miss All-America Camp Beauty Pageant held in New York City Town Hall, a competition documented in The Queen (1968). In a scene towards the end of documentary, LaBeija, upset with the perceived racism of the white-run balls, accused the pageant organizer Flawless Sabrina of rigging the judging in the favor of a white queen, Rachel Harlow. Refusing to participate further in a discriminatory system, LaBeija worked with another Black drag queen, Lottie LaBeija, to host a ball just for Black queens. She agreed to participate in the event so long as she was highlighted in the ball. This event, the first to be hosted by a House, was titled \\"Crystal & Lottie LaBeija presents the first annual House of Labeija Ball at Up the Downstairs Case on West 115th Street & 5th Avenue in Harlem, NY\\" and took place in 1972. It was the first time the term \\"House\\" was used, coined by LaBeija in order to market the event, which would be a huge success. LaBeija continued to work as a drag performer and activist throughout the 1970s and 1980s. RuPaul's first experience of a drag performance was seeing LaBeija perform a lipsync routine at a nightclub in Atlanta in 1979. LaBeija died of liver failure in 1982. ==Legacy == LaBeija's iconic speech about racial discrimination in queer culture in The Queen continues to reverberate in queer culture. Aja drew on it in her performance as LaBeija as part of the Snatch Game in RuPaul's Drag Race All Stars in 2018, while musician Frank Ocean sampled it in a 2016 track. , the eponymous House founded by LaBeija still exists. She was succeeded as House mother by Pepper LaBeija; the current mother of the House of LaBeija is Kia LaBeija. In June 2019, LaBeija was one of the inaugural fifty American “pioneers, trailblazers, and heroes” inducted on the National LGBTQ Wall of Honor within the Stonewall National Monument (SNM) in New York City’s Stonewall Inn. The SNM is the first U.S. national monument dedicated to LGBTQ rights and history, and the wall’s unveiling was timed to take place during the 50th anniversary of the Stonewall riots. ==See also== * LGBT culture in New York City * List of self-identified LGBTQ New Yorkers ==References== Category:American drag queens Category:House of LaBeija Category:LGBT African Americans Category:LGBT people from New York (state) Category:Transgender drag performers ","title":"Crystal LaBeija"},{"id":"56634077","text":"The Maung Nu massacre was a mass-killing of Rohingya people by the Myanmar Army that reportedly happened in the village of Maung Nu (also known as Monu Para), in Rakhine State, Myanmar on 27 August 2017. In February 2018, video evidence emerged allegedly showing government-contracted workers bulldozing parts of Maung Nu, with visible body bags and corpses in the footage. ==Background== The Rohingya people are an ethnic minority that mainly live in the northern region of Rakhine State, Myanmar, and have been described as one of the world's most persecuted minorities. In modern times, the persecution of Rohingyas in Myanmar dates back to the 1970s. Since then, Rohingya people have regularly been made the target of persecution by the government and nationalist Buddhists. The tension between various religious groups in the country had often been exploited by the past military governments of Myanmar. According to Amnesty International, the Rohingya have suffered from human rights violations under past military dictatorships since 1978, and many have fled to neighbouring Bangladesh as a result. In 2005, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees had assisted with the repatriation of Rohingyas from Bangladesh, but allegations of human rights abuses in the refugee camps threatened this effort. In 2015, 140,000 Rohingyas remained in IDP camps after communal riots in 2012. On 25 August 2017, insurgents of the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA) launched their second large-scale attack on the Myanmar Army, leading to new \\"clearance operations\\" by the government, which critics argue targeted civilians. Many Rohingyas sought refuge at Maung Nu, after fleeing neighbouring villages upon hearing gunfire. ==Massacre== At around 11:00 AM on 27 August 2017, dozens of Myanmar Army soldiers from Battalion 564 arrived in Maung Nu, prompting most of the Rohingya villagers to hide in their homes. According to 37 alleged survivors of the massacre, a soldier demanded that the villagers come outside, and when nobody did the soldiers opened fire on the homes. Soldier then stormed into the homes, looting valuables, assaulting women, and detaining men and boys. Some of the men detained were allegedly executed afterwards on the order of the commanding officer. ==See also== * Gu Dar Pyin massacre * Inn Din massacre * 2017 Rohingya persecution in Myanmar * List of massacres in Myanmar ==References== Category:2017 in Myanmar Category:Internal conflict in Myanmar Category:History of Rakhine Category:Rohingya conflict Category:Massacres in Myanmar Category:Massacres in 2017 Category:Massacres of men Category:Persecution by Buddhists Category:Persecution of Muslims Category:Violence against men in Asia Category:Violence against Muslims Category:August 2017 crimes in Asia Category:Massacres of Muslims ","title":"Maung Nu massacre"},{"id":"56634083","text":"St David's is the name of an electoral ward in Pembrokeshire, Wales.

Stormin participated in a jungle rave called 'Kool Skool', wherein MC's from all around London would clash on stage, with the winner taking home £100 and a slot on Kool FM. After that, his name got around and Stormin was able to circuit various radio stations across London. After making waves across the numerous pirate radio stations, he co- founded Nasty Crew alongside Marcus Nasty and Sharky Major. The crew went on to recruit MCs such as Kano, D Double E, and Jammer. His versatility and ability to MC across a range of different tempos earned him praise amongst his peers and listeners alike. As one of the earliest MC's to take UK garage instrumentals and use dark lyrics similar to US influenced hip hop it was this sound which saw the birth of grime. Early affiliates included Dizzee Rascal with whom he recorded one of his first ever tracks. In later years he was part of a group of jump-up MCs called SaSaSaS and also worked under an anonymous and masked alias Teddy Bruckshot inspired by Louie Rankin's character in the 2002 movie release Shottas releasing on labels such as Deep Medi Musik.

Cantelon (born 1940) is the co-founder and CEO of History Associates Incorporated and a leading pioneer in the field of applied history. He previously taught contemporary American history at Williams College, and is a founding member of the National Council on Public History and the Society for History in the Federal Government. Cantelon is an expert on oral history, foundations, business and institutional history, as well as the history of deregulation. ==Early Life and education== Philip L. Cantelon is a historian who has worked in both academia and applied history. He graduated from Dartmouth College in 1962 with a degree in history and subsequently earned a MA at the University of Michigan in 1963. He received his PhD from Indiana University in 1971. ==Career== Cantelon began his teaching career at Williams College in 1968, specializing in contemporary American and Oral history. In 1974, he took a leave of absence from Williams to work in the policy office at the Department of Housing and Urban Development and as a speechwriter for Secretary Carla Hills. In 1978, he received a Fulbright Professorship of American Civilization to teach history for a year at Kyushu University and Seinan Gakuin University in Fukuoka, Japan. After his HUD and Fulbright experience, Cantelon turned from the classroom to the practical application of history – what would become popularized as ‘public history’. The opportunity to apply history came soon after the Three Mile Island accident in 1979. A former Williams colleague at the United States Department of Energy asked if Cantelon would write a history of the agency's response to the accident. Cantelon teamed up with Robert C. Williams, a professor at Washington University in St. Louis, to write Crisis Contained: The Department of Energy at Three Mile Island, published in 1980. Struck by the impact of a practical application of history – and that historians could assess an event that happened months, not just decades before – he and three colleagues, Richard G. Hewlett, who was retiring as the Department of Energy’s Chief Historian, Williams, and Rodney P. Carlisle of Rutgers University established a new business venture. In January 1981, they founded History Associates Incorporated. Cantelon served as president from 1981 to 2006. Since then, he has served as the organization's CEO and senior historian. His client list includes General Electric, the Kendall Foundation, the GAR Foundation, Consolidated Edison, Texas Instruments, MCI Communications, Roadway Services, CF Transportation, the National Institute of Nursing Research, The Children’s Inn at NIH, The Institute of Nuclear Power Operations, and the World Association of Nuclear Operators.

He joined the army of Tuscany in its war against the Turks, and for his courage in battle he was made a Knight of the Order of Tuscany. After his military service he became a musician, specializing in innovative music for the guitar family. ==Publications and writings== Carbonchi's first book, Sonate de chitarra spagnola con intavolatura franzese, was published in Florence in 1640. This book was dedicated to Mattias de' Medici as a patron of music. The music in this book is written in French-style lute tabulature, regardless of whether the music was to be plucked or strummed. Carbonchi wrote that the French notation was in response to requests by his foreign students. Carbonchi's second book, Dodici chitarre spostate, was published in Florence in 1643. This volume was dedicated to the Marchese Bartolomeo Corsini. The final 32 compositions contained in this work are written for twelve guitars, each guitar tuned to a different note on the chromatic scale. Although such an ensemble is unlikely, it empirically proved the guitar's utility as a chromatic instrument. In addition to the two published works, there exist manuscripts known to be by Carbonchi, as well as those attributed to him. ==Style== Carbonchi's compositions consist of music written in the Italian dance styles, including the Ciacconda, Passacaglia, and Spagnoletta various dance-songes. ==References== Category:Italian guitarists Category:Italian Baroque composers Category:People from Florence ","title":"Antonio Carbonchi"},{"id":"56634227","text":"Cameron Kasky (born November 11, 2000) is an American activist and advocate against gun violence who co-founded the student-led gun violence prevention advocacy group Never Again MSD. He is notable for helping to organize the March for Our Lives nationwide student protest in March 2018. Kasky is a survivor of the February 2018 mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. Kasky was included in Time magazine's 100 Most Influential People of 2018. == Early life and education == Kasky was a student, a \\"theatre kid\\", and former member of the drama club at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School (MSD) in Parkland, Florida, and was a junior at the time of the school shooting in February 2018. He has a younger brother with autism who is also a survivor of the MSD shooting. He currently attends Columbia University.Jon Levine, August 31, 2019, New York Post, Parkland shooting survivor Cameron Kasky is ‘excited’ to be going to Columbia University, Retrieved September 7, 2019 == Advocacy == Kasky had just left drama class when the shooting began at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida on February 14, 2018. After meeting his younger brother at a different classroom and exiting the school, the fire alarm sounded. With other students, they were instructed to go back inside. They waited an hour in a classroom until they were rescued. After the shooting, Kasky brought several school friends to his house and with them founded Never Again MSD (#NeverAgain), a student-led gun control advocacy group. Kasky came up with the name \\"Never Again\\" while the group stayed up through the night to make plans, and he posted \\"Stay alert. #NeverAgain\\" to Facebook. The group works to create a national movement against gun violence, including an effort to publicize legislators receiving money from the NRA and persuading people not to vote for them. It promoted and led a massive rally called March for Our Lives in Washington, DC, on March 24, 2018. According to a report in The New Yorker, it was Kasky's idea to found the activist group along with fellow students David Hogg, Emma González, Sarah Chadwick and others – a group described by reporter Michael Schulman as having \\"moral clarity and vision\\" in the gun control debate. Kasky wrote an op-ed on the CNN website describing the events of the massacre and his reaction to it. In an interview, Kasky told the CNN anchor Anderson Cooper that \\"my generation won't stand for this.\\" Although known as a \\"theatre kid\\" with a reputation for being the class clown, Kasky's experience after the shooting was primarily one of anger: At a televised \\"Stand Up\\" town hall session sponsored by CNN with Senator Marco Rubio, Kasky asked the senator whether he would continue receiving money from the National Rifle Association (NRA): \\"Can you tell me right now that you will not accept a single donation from the NRA?\\" Rubio responded by saying, \\"I will always accept the help of anyone who agrees with my agenda.\\" Kasky repeatedly questioned Rubio about whether he would continue receiving NRA money. The senator did not offer a definitive response but appeared to soften his positions regarding some gun restrictions. Kasky temporarily stopped utilizing Facebook as a result of death threats. When later Kasky was accused of being a crisis actor, he replied to CNN's Wolf Blitzer that \\"if you had seen me in our school's production of 'Fiddler on the Roof,' you would know that nobody would pay me to act for anything.\\" Kasky announced the March for Our Lives rally on February 18, 2018. Later that week, Kasky appeared on The Ellen DeGeneres Show with Emma González and Jaclyn Corin to discuss their advocacy and march. Kasky said, \\"The thing that inspired us to create the march was people saying, 'This is not the time to talk about gun control, this is the time to mourn.' We understand that, so here's the time to talk about gun control. March 24th.\\" In March 2018, he appeared on the cover of Time magazine along with fellow activists Jaclyn Corin, Emma Gonzalez, David Hogg, and Alex Wind.Associated Press, March 22, 2018, Houston Public Media, \\"Parkland Students On Cover Of Time Magazine\\" , Retrieved March 22, 2018, Note: cover third week March 2018; \\"...The cover features Marjory Stoneman Douglas students Jaclyn Corin, Alex Wind, Emma Gonzalez, Cameron Kasky and David Hogg,...\\" Kasky called President Donald Trump a \\"professional liar\\" on CNN after Trump delivered a pro-gun speech at the annual NRA convention in Dallas in May 2018, in contrast to Trump's prior call for gun control reform in the wake of the Parkland shooting.

It raises the minimum age for buying firearms to 21, establishes waiting periods and background checks, provides a program for the arming of some teachers and the hiring of school police, bans bump stocks, and bars potentially violent or mentally unhealthy people arrested under certain laws from possessing guns. In all, it allocates around $400 million. The governor signed the bill into law on March 9. He commented, \\"To the students of Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, you made your voices heard. You didn't let up and you fought until there was change.\\" === Departure from March for Our Lives === On September 19, 2018, Kasky announced his decision to leave March for Our Lives in an interview with Fox News Radio. He expressed regret for some of his past actions, including confronting Rubio at the \\"Stand Up\\" town hall session and saying the name of the Parkland shooter aloud in his question to Rubio. However, Kasky said his decision to leave March for Our Lives was not due to a change of heart or political views. Instead, he wants to take responsibility for his actions and encourages others to seek mental health services when necessary. Moving past March for Our Lives, Kasky is working on improving himself personally and a new podcast, \\"Cameron Knows Nothing\\". ===Reactions=== In The New Yorker, journalist Evan Osnos singled out Kasky's direct questioning of Marco Rubio at the CNN town hall as significant and as something no journalist had ever been able to do. People magazine stated that as founder of the #NeverAgain movement, and despite death threats from NRA supporters, \\"Kasky has committed himself to advancing legislative changes that will make it more difficult for people to get guns, and in the process, has helped inspire advocacy around the cause\\". ==Politics== Kasky endorsed Andrew Yang in the 2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries, claiming to be \\"very tired of... the same nonsense that’s been failing the American people for generations. Yang is offering up solutions that change the game.\\" Upon Yang dropping out, Kasky threw his support behind Bernie Sanders, and subsequently endorsed Joe Biden in the general election. == Selected works == * ==References* * Survivor to Rubio: Will you reject NRA money?

He distinguished himself during the expulsions of Polish Jews (known as the Polish Action) from Leipzig by the Nazi regime in October 1938. His actions as consul general resulted in up to 1500 Jews being spared from deportation. ==Career== Chiczewski was born in Sosnowiec, Poland, in 1889. He studied business in Antwerp followed by graduating from the University of Warsaw with a degree in higher administration. He spent his career working for the Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs, where he served many roles. From 1920-1922, he was the Consulate of the Republic of Poland in Gałacz. From 1922-1928 he held the same position in Bucharest, Romania. He left Romania in 1928 and worked in the Polish parliament and as a consul in Brussels until November 1934. On November 1, 1934, he became the Head of the Consulate of the Republic of Poland in Leipzig. == Polish Action (Polenaktion) of 1938 in Leipzig == A 31 March 1938 decision made by the Polish government to terminate the citizenship of Poles who had lived abroad for more than 5 years left many Jews of Poland stateless. Rising tensions between the German and Polish foreign ministry lead to mass expulsions from the state of Saxony, the closest to the Polish border, beginning on 27 October 1938. 3364 of Leipzig's Jews were of Polish origin, making it the second largest population of Eastern European Jews in Germany. Around 4am on 27 October 1938, arrests of Jews began taking place in Leipzig by the Gestapo. The consulate learned of the ongoing arrests by 6am. As warnings about the upcoming arrests and subsequent expulsions began to spread on 27 October, many Jews sought shelter at the Polish Consulate, which was a large villa that had been rented from the Ury family. Questions remained about the legitimacy of the villa as extraterritorial grounds since the Polish government had not purchased it outright. Despite this, the police did not enter the grounds over fears of further damaging the frail Germany-Poland relationship. Chiczewski and his staff supported Jews who arrived at his gates by providing food and shelter, albeit in a limited manner. The police checked identification papers of some people entering the villa, others were arrested outside of the consulate. Personal accounts from survivors provide details of the situation inside the villa. Shlomo Wahrman, who spent several hours in the residence, described the Leipzigers as terrified about their unknown fate. Although Chiczewski had attempted to bring in as much food as he could, there was a severe food shortage. Since the villa lacked the means to support large numbers of people, significant assistance was provided by the local community, including families like the Wahrmans. Many Jews violated their religious observance of the Sabbath by cooking and baking on the grounds that saving lives overrides religious principle. The assistance of local businesses and individuals arriving at the villa supported the large population staying at the villa while Polish officials worked to protect them from deportation. Various sources estimate the number of Jews seeking shelter to have been between 1200-1500, with 1296 Jews being a common figure. Police reports indicate 1296 Jews had taken shelter there, roughly 50% of the Jewish population in Leipzig. Chiczewski negotiated with the German foreign ministry to not only prevent the expulsion of the Leipzig Jews, but successfully allowed roughly 1300 Jews to return to their homes in Leipzig. According to Chiczewski's report, he received assurance from the Police Chief of Leipzig that the Jews would not have any trouble remaining in Germany until the matter had been resolved with a Polish-German agreement. Most of those who sought assistance from Chiczewski at the villa received a passport renewal to prevent them from becoming stateless individuals. Police reports indicated that Chiczewski encouraged others to burn their passports in order to prevent formal identification of their citizenship used in displacement and the passage over the border into Poland. However, this information is not included in Chiczewski's own report. For the remaining Jews who had either not been warned, arrested before they could flee, or chose not to seek shelter, Chiczewski attempted to prevent their expulsion at each stage of the process. Chiczewski was not alone in his belief that the expulsions could be prevented, thus he and other Polish diplomats assured the Jews that their detainment had been a \\"mistake.\\" Chiczewski made efforts at calming the Jews at the gymnasium where the Jews had been gathered, as well as at the train station. Despite his negotiations, he was ultimately unsuccessful in his attempts to block the deportations. Estimates vary on the number of Jews deported from Leipzig between 1500 and 3500. Wahrman reported that about 5000 were expelled. == Commemoration == Feliks Chiczewski's actions during the expulsions of Polish Jews from Leipzig in October 1938 have garnered him recognition by the Polish Institute of Leipzig. His actions were commemorated amongst other Polish heroes in the \\"They Risked Their Lives...\\" Exhibition which took place in Leipzig in 2015. The Institute also honored the 70th anniversary of the event, where his sister in law, Gabriela Chiczewski, participated in his honor. In 2000, a plaque commemorating his actions was hung in front of the villa. == References == Category:1889 births Category:1972 deaths Category:Jewish Polish history Category:University of Warsaw alumni Category:Polish diplomats ","title":"Feliks Chiczewski"},{"id":"56634257","text":"Northward Hill is a biological Site of Special Scientific Interest Kent.

Jones was born in Chester, South Carolina. In 1961 Jones joined the Freedom Riders driving from Atlanta, Georgia, to Birmingham, Alabama; he was later arrested in Montgomery, Alabama. He led and participated in several sit- in movements during the 1960s. In 1966, Jones organized an activist organization called the Action Coordinating Committee to End Segregation in the Suburbs or ACCESS. He was a graduate of Howard University Law School (1966). Jones passed the North Carolina State Bar in 1976. He also served as the chairperson for the Biddleville/Smallwood/Five Points Neighborhood Association. ==Early life and education== Jones was born in Chester, South Carolina, on August 23, 1937. His mother was an English teacher, and his father a Presbyterian missionary who went to rural areas to speak to people about Christianity. His birth was unexpected so he was born at his parents' house. He was often exposed to racial discrimination in his youth, and witnessed his parent attempt to save a young boy from being killed by the Ku Klux Klan after smiling at a white woman in the town. > There was a day, when I was about six, that Jonesy had been accused of > smiling at a white lady uptown and the word was out that they (the Klan) > were going to get him. So my father and his friend put Jonesy in the trunk > of the car with some food, and they drove off. I didn’t understand it at the > time, but they were saving him from being lynched – just for smiling at her. > I began to realize the harsh consequences of not obeying the rules. — J. > Charles Jones He lived in Chester for ten years until his family moved to Charlotte, North Carolina, in 1947. They made the move so his father could attend Johnson C. Smith University, having been told by the church that he must acquire a degree. Jones himself later enrolled in Johnson C. Smith University for theology in 1960. ==Civil rights activism== On February 1, 1960, after attending the National Youth Summit Conference in the Soviet Union, Jones learned of a sit-in protest at the Greensboro Woolworth staged by four black activists to peacefully confront racial segregation. On February 8, 1960, Jones went to the vice chair of the student body and met with some of his classmates to inform them he intended to launch a similar sit-in protest in Charlotte's Woolworth on February 9. At least 200 of his classmates joined in the first sit-in at the local Woolworth. At that sit-in, Jones stated to reporters: > I have no malice, no jealousy, no hatred, no envy. All I want is to come in > and place my order and be served and leave a tip if I feel like it. — J. > Charles Jones On March 7, 1960, after the local Woolworth closed its counters to prevent blacks from continuing their demonstration, around 100 students went to a local hardware store and sat at the soda fountain until they were served to continue the protest. Students from Livingston College joined in the movement as well, and went to Salisbury drug stores to sit-in. Two of the stores refused them service. Some teenagers then subsequently staged picket lines at local drug stores in the city that refused to serve blacks. Jones and the students from Johnson C. Smith University returned on March 24, 1960, to Woolworth, as Jones stated, to \\"keep up the demonstrations as a symbol and to keep the public aware of the discrimination\\" blacks faced in the region. ===Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee=== Jones co-founded the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC), with Ella Baker and many others at Shaw University in 1960. He was involved in leading and participating in many sit-ins and other protests for the committee. Jones stated of his participation in the sit-ins, \\"We were obligated to do it. The movement had caught fire.\\" After staging a sit-in in Rock Hill, South Carolina, nine black activists were arrested for \\"refusing to stop singing hymns during their morning devotions.\\" In response, the SNCC sent Jones, Charles Sherrod, Diane Nash, and Ruby Doris Smith to get arrested in order to carry out the committee's \\"jail, no bail\\" newly designed strategy, which was intended to prevent the movement from being financially disenfranchised by being jailed and having to pay money for bail. On July 19, 1962, Jones obtained a permit and organized an integration protest at the all-white Tift Park in Albany, Georgia. The police however, still kept the blacks segregated in a more secluded area of the park. The Albany park officials stated they had been tricked into allowing blacks to stage the protest at the park, stating that white people had submitted the permit and that they were not aware blacks would be present. Jones and two other black SNCC activists used the all-white restroom at the park, and the police quickly closed all of bathrooms in the park except for two which were kept under close police supervision. On July 27, 1962, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., William G. Anderson, Slater King, Ralph Abernathy, and five other black civil rights activists and leaders lined up in front of the Albany City Hall's police headquarters to demand a discussion with the city government about racial integration in the city. The police chief refused to let them into the building, and King asked Abernathy to lead the activists in a prayer. The police chief stated that if they did not leave they would be arrested. They all refused to leave. King had previously stated that they were willing to fill every jail in Georgia for demonstrating for civil rights. They were then all arrested and led into the jail. A few hours after these arrests Jones led a group of seventeen more activists (including Freedom Singer Rutha Harris) to the police headquarters. Jones proceeded to kneel and read from a written prayer. The police chief paced among the protesters as Jones prayed. After the prayer was completed, Jones requested that the activists stay kneeling in \\"peaceful meditation\\". The police chief ordered the group to move, and when they refused for the third time the chief said that the protesters could either walk into the jail peacefully or be brought in forcibly. Ten of the activists walked into the jail to be arrested, and the remaining members continued to kneel in place and were forcibly brought into the jail on stretchers. ===Freedom Riders=== In 1961 Jones participated in the Freedom Riders movement. He and other activists rode buses into the segregated southern United States, to challenge the non-enforcement in the southern United States of the Supreme Court rulings Morgan v. Virginia (1946) and Boynton v. Virginia (1960),364 U.S. which decided that segregated public buses were unconstitutional.; also > We got on the bus, we went further south, and the crowds of angry white folk > started to get bigger and bigger. I heard my grandma's spirit say, \\"You're > God's child; you're as good as any of them.\\" — J. Charles Jones ===March on Washington=== In 1963, Jones participated in the planning for the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom. He recalled attending the I Have a Dream speech by King, and was struck with awe at the number of people who showed up. > I had never seen that many people. I said 'Oh my God.' My spirit just began > to lift and lift and lift, and I was awed at that moment at what was > happening. — J. Charles Jones After witnessing King begin to deliver his speech, he said that he knew change was going to happen. ===ACCESS=== In June 1966 Jones founded a movement named the Action Coordinating Committee to End Segregation in the Suburbs (ACCESS) to attempt to end the racial segregation he saw occurring in the Washington beltway. With a group of fellow activists he marched the entire of Georgia Avenue. His intention was to bring attention to the local white landlords who refused to rent to blacks. Jones stated the apartments around the Beltway, were essentially creating a \\"white ghetto surrounding the black ghetto\\". The protest march took four days to complete. In 1967, Jones attended a meeting with the eighth U.S. Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara. Jones believed this was a viable way to solve the segregation of blacks from white landlords as the military had the power to make apartments which refused to rent to blacks off limits to all military personnel. Such a move would financially motivate the apartments to change their racially discriminatory policies. In June 1967, Secretary of Defense McNamara followed through on Jones' suggestion and banned all service members from residing at any apartment which was segregated within a radius of the Andrews Air Force Base Air traffic control tower. ==Later life and legacy== Jones moved to the majority black Biddleville community in Charlotte, N.C., where he worked as an attorney. He considered himself semi- retired in his later years. However, he continued to be an active advocate for his community. He combined and served as the chairperson for the Biddleville Neighborhood Association and the Smallwood Community Organization. The organizations were previously split by race, and Jones is credited with causing their integration. Tom Hanchett, a historian, stated of Jones that he was \\"ageless\\" and continued to make historical changes around him well into his 80s: > Charles Jones talked about a beloved community, a city in which we all > talked to each other, respect each other. Because of Charles Jones we are > much closer to that beloved community than we would’ve been without his > courage. — Tom Hanchett On December 9, 2019 the city council of Charlotte officially declared that day to be Joseph Charles Jones Day; on his behalf, his wife accepted the honor. Jones died on December 27, 2019, at the age of 82 from complications of Alzheimer's disease and sepsis. Charlotte City Councilman Justin Harlow described Jones after his death as \\"a true stalwart in advocacy\\". ==See also== *Jim Crow laws *Civil Rights Movement ==References== Category:1937 births Category:2019 deaths Category:Activists for African-American civil rights Category:People from Chester, South Carolina Category:Howard University School of Law alumni Category:Johnson C.

It has a single hollow, onion-like leaf and up to sixty small, green and white scented flowers well-spaced along the flowering stem. It usually grows in swampy places, flowers more prolifically after summer fires and sometimes forms very large colonies. == Description == Microtis brownii is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and a single erect, smooth, tubular leaf long and wide. Between five and fifty green to yellowish-green and white flowers are well-spaced along a flowering stem tall. The flowers are scented, about long and wide. The dorsal sepal is about long, wide and forms a hood over the column. The lateral sepals are about long with their tips rolled under. The petals are about long and held under the dorsal sepal or alongside it. The labellum is about long, wide with crinkled edges and bends down to almost touch the ovary. Flowering occurs from November to January but more prolifically after fire the previous summer. ==Taxonomy and naming== Microtis brownii was first formally described in 1871 by Heinrich Gustav Reichenbach and the description was published in Beitrage zur Systematischen Pflanzenkunde. The specific epithet (brownii) honours the Scottish botanist Robert Brown. ==Distribution and habitat== The sweet mignonette orchid usually grows in swampy places but sometimes in woodland, forest or inland granite outcrops. It sometimes forms colonies of thousands of plants and is widespread and common, especially between Perth and Esperance. ==Conservation== Microtis brownii is classified as \\"not threatened\\" by the Western Australian Government Department of Parks and Wildlife. == References == == External links == * Category:Prasophyllinae brownii Category:Endemic orchids of Australia Category:Orchids of Western Australia Category:Plants described in 1871 ","title":"Microtis brownii"},{"id":"56634492","text":"Andrei Mazunov (born 1967) is a male Russian former international table tennis player.

Another alias for this gene is TPR repeat protein 16, but this is not commonly used. TTC16 is one of many proteins that contain tetratricopeptide repeat motifs as a supersecondary structure. == Gene == A visual representation of major domains and post translational sites on TTC16.Predicted serine, threonine, and tyrosine phosphorylation sites of TTC16.A predicted model for TTC16, with 63% of the sequence fully modeled and 41% of positions disordered.The TTC16 gene is located on human chromosome 9 at site 9q34.11. TTC16 is made up of ten tetratricopeptide motifs and has 16 exons. Other notable TPR containing peptides include HOP, PEX5, and neutrophil cytosolic factor 2. TTC16 is highly conserved among species, found among invertebrates such as the eastern oyster (Crassostrea virginica) and the purple sea urchin (Strongylocentrotus purpuratus). TTC16 has no paralogs. === Transcription Factors === The many transcription factors of TTC16 are commonly found in cells of the immune system, including several types of white blood cells and red blood cells, the respiratory system, and the endocrine system. == Protein == The TPR motifs that make up TTC16 belong to the TPR_11 super family, while the later half of the protein is made of the Pumilio Superfamily. The molecular weight is 98.3 kdal and the isoelectric point is 9.15 making TTC16 a basic protein. In total, the TTC16 protein is 873 amino acids in length. There are two isoforms, of which variant 1 is the longest. There are 17 spliced versions of the gene. === Post Translational Modifications === The protein contains many putative binding sites and forms alpha helix chains. Within the cell, TTC16 is found within the nucleus. Most of the post translational modifications are concentrated in the latter half, phosphorylation in particular is constant in the Pumilio Superfamily region. There are also 4 nuclear localization signals and 7 O-linked glycosylation sites. There are no N-linked glycosylation sites. === Structure === TTC16 forms several alpha helices and coiled-coil regions. Domains containing TPR motifs show stronger stability than regions without. === Protein Interactions === There is only one known case of TTC16 interaction, involving polymerase basic protein 2 (pb2). Pb2 is involved in transcription initiation and the generation of primers for viral transcription. == Expression == TTC16 is found in high numbers in the testis, followed by the lung, pituitary gland, and tonsil. Evidence shows the omental adipose tissue of obese children have higher expression of TTC16 in comparison to non-obese children. Expression is also relatively high and constant CD8+ cells. == Function == Tetratricopeptide motifs often act as stabilizers in protein-protein interactions. While the specific function of TTC16 isn't well understood by scientists, many other proteins containing TPR motifs give insight into its possible activity. Because of the many connections to the immune system, such as tissue expression and transcription factors, it is thought that TTC16 plays a role in immune system response. == References == ","title":"Tetratricopeptide repeat domain 16 isoform 1"},{"id":"56634566","text":"On January 26, 2012, at the office of the Consulate General of Japan in New York, Grant Ujifusa, Redress Strategy Chair of the Japanese American Citizens League, was knighted by the Government of Japan for reversing President Ronald Reagan's opposition to HR 442, the Japanese American redress bill.that secured an apology and monetary reparations for loyal Americans who were forced into prison camps during World War II. Grant Ujifusa was born on January 4, 1942, in Worland, Wyoming, and grew up with his younger sister Susan on a sugar beet farm not far from that agreeable and friendly small town, one very much still located about 65 miles southeast of Heart Mountain, perhaps the most famous of the camps where Japanese Americans were imprisoned during World War II. Grant's grandfather, Ujifusa Shuichi, came to northern Wyoming in 1905 to help to lay track for the Chicago, Burlington, and Quincy Railroad. After the work was completed, Shuichi decided to shovel and level farmland out of the local erose desert and raise a family, including Grant's father Tom, in an isolated geological basin surrounded by the Rocky Mountains and three sister ranges. Through the arid basin flowed the Big Horn River from which water was diverted to irrigate Shuichi's farm. So the Ujifusa family, a 1000 miles from the West Coast, was not sent to a camp during World War II. Nor was the family of Grant's mother Mary Takayo, whose father Okugawa Jukichi settled in La Junta, Colorado, and found work as a machinist on the Santa Fe Railroad. Mary had the best grades in the La Junta High School Class of 1939, and was named the valedictorian. The teachers and the kids really liked her, but the administrators and the school board said, \\"No jap will speak at our commencement.\\" And so she didn't. But Mary could speak, read, and write Japanese with complete fluency, because she had attended a Japanese language school, established by local immigrants, for 3 months every summer for 12 years. Mary was an exceptional student year round, but her family was too poor to send her to college. And so a marriage was arranged for the eldest child in the Okugawa family, a marriage that became a love match between Mary and Tom. One of Grant's earliest memories was formed when eight Heart Mountain internees were given leave to help with Grandpa's 1944 sugar beet harvest. The men lived with the family in the big farm house. Grant, the toddler, grew especially close to internee Joe Furuta of Tacoma, and would lock the fingers of his small hands around the back of Mr. Furuta's neck and, hanging like a monkey, be carried from place to place. Joe Furuta was a lovely, gentle man, imprisoned of course at Heart Mountain because he was surely a spy and a saboteur. When Grant was about 9, Grandpa Shuichi advised his grandson, called Masa in a three generation household, that \\"You have to be careful in life because you come from a dumb family.\\" \\"Why would you say something like that, Grandpa?\\" the once bi-lingual Masa asked. \\"Because,\\" Grandpa said, \\"I voluntarily chose to settle in a part of the world to which 11,000 people were involuntarily removed. Think about it.\\" Grandpa, besides raising sugar beets, ran a big herd of cattle on the open range outside of Worland, ridin' and ropin' just like the other local cowboys, with one of them saying years later, \\"You know that Japanese man out there with us once. Pretty good little wrangler.\\" Not bad for the descendant of Japanese peasant farmers who lived for generations in a country where only the upper, but not the lower, class of samurai could get near a horse. In 1938 or 1939, the Japanese Consul General in San Francisco journeyed all the way to Worland to offer Grandpa 10,000 acres in Manchuria to raise open range beef cattle. Not many Japanese, maybe none, knew how to do that. To be a rancher on horseback like those around him in the surrounding mountains was farmer Grandpa's dream. The family was packed and ready to go when Grandpa at the last minute changed his mind and decided to stay in Wyoming. Then in 1951, they struck oil on Grandpa's farm. After which he said, \\"Actually, people say I am very smart, but I am something much better than that, which is lucky, Karma lucky. Married to the Issei cowboy was gentle Grandma Yae, ever caring, a Buddhist saint, a bodhisattva, if ever there was one in the state of Wyoming. Susan was close to Grandma, and Tom, completely devoted to his family, was more like his mother than his father. Tom died in 2002. After Mary died in 2007, Ambassador Ryozo Kato said of her, \\"Mary was a woman of fierce academic and practical intelligence, and a woman who was immensely proud of her Japanese heritage. I mourn her passing.\\" As a 149-pound high school senior, Grant was an all-conference quarterback of a state championship football team—ranked number one in the state in 1959, the same year he was elected Governor of Boys State. The year before Grant Ujifusa and the Worland Warriors defeated Dick Cheney and the Casper Mustangs by the score of 39 to 6. The Warriors had 450 kids in their high school; the Mustangs, 1800 kids. Twenty-nine years later, Grant persuaded Congressman Cheney to vote \\"yea\\" on HR 442. Grant left Wyoming to receive an AB with honors in 1965 from Harvard University, where he was an editor of The Harvard Crimson, and an ABT from Brown University in American History and Literature in 1969. Some twelve years later Min Yasui and Mike Masaoka recruited Ujifusa to lead the Japanese American Citizens League in its successful effort to pass and enact HR 442, the Japanese American redress bill. Signed into law by Ronald Reagan on August 10, 1988, the legislation provided for an apology and monetary reparations from the federal government for Franklin Roosevelt's imprisonment of loyal Americans during World War II.http://www.grantujifusa.org/New%20York%20Consulate.html From 1982 to 1992, Grant served as JACL's volunteer Redress Strategy Chair, but he did nothing but watch Spark Matsunaga work three intense years to put together a 69-vote, filibuster-proof majority for Senate passage of the redress bill in the spring of 1988. Why the bi-partisan support? One reason: Sparky called in all his chits owed to him over the years from fellow senators. Another reason: Sparky's colleagues just loved him, someone who lived the Aloha understanding of life. Senate success, Daniel Inouye said, was ten parts Matsunaga and one part the other Senator from Hawaii. This means no parts for a Senator from Wyoming and a one-time Boy Scout who voted to strip all of the monetary reparations out of the bill, saying on the Senate floor that \\"the money sticks in my craw\\" and recently in the Washington Post that the money in the bill made the apology \\"insincere.\\" The long ago Boy Scout from Wyoming cannot name a single Senator he persuaded to vote for Sparky's bill. And so, Sparky's legacy should be returned to him. In 1990, Grant worked with Senator Inouye and with Janet Hale in the first Bush Administration's Office of Management and Budget to make the monetary reparations authorized in the bill an entitlement expenditure, not subject to the vagaries of the annual appropriations process. In 2012, Grant was knighted by the Government of Japan for his work done in 1987 and 1988 that reversed Ronald Reagan's longstanding opposition to HR 442. While lobbying the redress bill, Grant also worked as a Senior Editor of general interest books at Random House, earlier at Houghton Mifflin and later at Macmillan. Writers with whom he worked included Andrew Grove, Senator Sam Ervin, Governor Tom Kean, Lester Thurow, Robert Eisner, Kevin Phillips, Julian Jaynes, Judy Shelton, Yuji Ichioka, Merry White, and Daniel Yergin. Ujifusa was, as well, the founding editor and longtime co- author of The Almanac of American Politics, called by Tim Russert and George Will \\"the bible of American politics.\\" The 1600-page, pre-internet, biennial volume provided description and analysis, using words and numbers, for each of the 535 members of the House and the Senate and for all of the 535 constituencies represented in Congress. Also covered were the 50 state governors. This meant The Almanac, a National Book Award finalist in 1973, encompassed the entire geographical expanse of the country and its people three times. Ujifusa co-authored the book from 1972 to 2000 when it was an everywhere presence inside the Beltway, used by everyone with any responsibility in the White House, Congress, the media, the cabinet and agency bureaucracies, and the lobbying and law firms. The Almanac gave Grant access virtually anywhere he wanted in Washington during the 1980s, most importantly in the Reagan White House and among Republican members of Congress. Grant convinced not only Dick Cheney, but also Newt Gingrich, to vote \\"yea\\" on HR 442, even while a Japanese American congressman from San Jose voted \\"present.\\" Another Japanese American congressman from Sacramento waived his rights to any forthcoming $20,000 so that he could vote \\"yea\\" on the floor, which he did, contributing to the 218 votes needed to guarantee passage. Grant decided to join the redress movement because of what was denied to his mother at her high school graduation and because of his memories of Joe Furuta. For his work on redress, Grant was made an honorary member of K Company, 442 RCT. More on his experience of redress and life in Wyoming can be found at: grantujifusa.com. As for Susan, she was elected Governor of Girls State, and went to Wellesley after high school. For 10 years between 2001 and 2011, Ujifusa worked as a political consultant at the New York Japanese Consulate, and from 2001 to the present, on Wall Street. He is married to Amy Brooks, a graduate of Sarah Lawrence and the Juilliard School of Music. They have two biological sons, Steven, a historian who recently published Barons of the Sea with Simon and Schuster and Andrew, a journalist with Education Week. Both are graduates of Harvard. Adopted son John, Amy, and Grant live in Chappaqua, New York, a suburb about 30 miles north of New York City, but they regularly return to their Wyoming farm, which has now been in family hands for 107 years. ==References== ==External links== *Personal Website *Interview with The Asia Society *Grant Ujifusa To Receive Order of The Rising Sun *Speech to the Japanese American Veterans Association *The Perpetual Foreigners *A historical anthology on redress * Category:1942 births Category:People from Worland, Wyoming Category:20th-century American historians Category:American political scientists Category:Activists from Wyoming Category:Harvard University alumni Category:Brandeis University alumni Category:Living people Category:21st- century American historians Category:American people of Japanese descent ","title":"Grant Ujifusa"},{"id":"56634575","text":"Kimani Griffin (born 2 July 1990) is an American speed skater who competes internationally.

London: Phoenix Press, 2003 ==Personal life== According to Harriette's memoirs, the teenage Sophia, \\"a remarkably shy, proud girl\\", was being pursued by Viscount Deerhurst, and Harriette recommended to her mother that Sophia be sent away to school. However, she eloped with Deerhurst, who, when found by her family, \\"declared that nothing wrong had occurred, he having passed the night with Sophia in mere conversation\\". Nevertheless, he moved her into squalid lodgings. Sophia quickly built up her own circle of admirers, including William FitzGerald, 2nd Duke of Leinster, and George Lamb. Initially, she claimed to dislike Berwick, but was eventually persuaded to marry him. ===Marriage to Lord Berwick=== On 8 February 1812, seventeen year old Sophia married forty-one year old Thomas Noel Hill, 2nd Baron Berwick at St Marylebone Parish Church, London, after an on-off courtship. They had no children. At Brighton, the new Lady Berwick was both admired and reviled for her lack of \\"illustrious descent\\". A local paper commented that \\"the late abuse of the press has in no degree diminished the vivacity so characteristic of her ladyship and family.\\" However, it has been suggested that, after her marriage, Sophia deliberately snubbed her sisters. The couple's extravagance was such that Lord Berwick went bankrupt in 1827. They were forced to sell most of their property, lease the house to his brother and live abroad. Lord Berwick died in Naples in 1832 and the barony was inherited by his younger brother, William Noel-Hill who became the 3rd Baron Berwick. Lady Berwick retired to Leamington Spa, where she died in her eighties. ==Legacy== Her portrait in miniature was painted by Richard Cosway in about 1812, and is held in the collection at Attingham Park. ==References== ==External links== *Papers Of Thomas Noel Hill, 2nd Baron Berwick Category:1794 births Category:1875 deaths Category:English baronesses ","title":"Sophia Dubochet"},{"id":"56634626","text":"Futoshi Shinohara (; born 14 April 1962) is a Japanese male former long- distance runner who competed in marathons.

It is an unofficial remake of the 1985 game Super Mario Bros. and was built using HTML5. ==Gameplay== As a remake of Super Mario Bros. (1985), Full Screen Marios gameplay is similar: it is a side-scrolling platform game in which the player controls Mario through levels. The game features all 32 levels that appeared in the original Super Mario Bros., and adds the option to select any one from the start. It also features an editor that enables players to create their own levels and a level generator that creates a random map. The game can also be played using an Xbox 360 controller. ==Development== Full Screen Mario was created by Josh Goldberg, who at the time was a junior at the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. Goldberg, who studies computer science and is a longtime Super Mario Bros. fan, wanted to create an \\"impressive\\" project when he conceived remaking a classic game in HTML5. One day, he and a friend discussed \\"how cool it would be if you could play Mario in [your] browser\\" and determined Super Mario Bros. was simple enough to remake. Goldberg began working on Full Screen Mario in October 2012 and finished a working demo the following month. From the beginning, Goldberg knew he wanted to add a map generator and a level editor; he wanted his remake to feel more modern when compared to playing the game in an emulator. Full Screen Mario uses the canvas element to render the levels. Unlike the original game, Full Screen Mario can be played in widescreen. Because Goldberg did not know how to rip content from a ROM image, he had to recreate all the game's assets from scratch. He used his personal copy of Super Mario Bros. Deluxe as a reference; he also consulted images of the original game's level designs from the internet and used them to manually recreate each level. Goldberg said this was tedious and took a considerable amount of time, but was not difficult. His greatest challenge was recreating the game's physics. According to Goldberg, \\"I'd never really made the physics before. People would randomly disappear during the game.\\" He spent months trying to perfect Mario's jumping physics. Goldberg said that remaking Super Mario Bros. was enjoyable because he could aspire to make it perfect: \\"Once your version matches the original, you know it's right\\". However, it was difficult for him to perfectly recreate the original game, and he spent a lot of time scrutinizing his work to make it as close as possible. After the initial release, Goldberg switched the code base from JavaScript to TypeScript to help reduce program bugs and crashes. Goldberg revealed Full Screen Mario on GitHub in January 2013. The game did not garner much attention until October 2013, when a writer on the website Boing Boing blogged about the game. This led to a significant increase in popularity. Shortly afterward, the website hosting the game, fullscreenmario.com, was getting around 300,000 visits a day. After about a month, on November 1, 2013, Goldberg took the project down after receiving a DMCA complaint from Nintendo, the publisher of Super Mario Bros. Nintendo argued the game infringed its copyright of the original game. By the time of the takedown, it had been played nearly 2.7 million times. Prior to the project's demise, Goldberg desired to add the option to share levels via email and multiplayer support.

Braide offered an African alternative to traditional evangelism. Rather than teaching creeds, he campaigned mainly on the destruction of idols. Braide also campaigned particularly effectively against alcohol consumption. After successes at healing people, Braide began to be viewed by his followers as a prophet. The decrease in alcohol consumption led authorities, worried about decreased tax revenue, to investigate him. Braide was arrested in March 1916 on charges including disturbing the peace.

Elliott is the son of Peter Archibald Elliott, a civil engineer, and Evelyn Sarah (née Wallace). He was educated at Pocklington School, the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst and the Royal Military College of Science, Shrivenham, where he earned a bachelor's degree in engineering. == Military career == Elliott was commissioned into the Royal Engineers in 1967, became a lieutenant in 1969, Captain in 1973, and Major in 1979. In 1969 he was created a Member of the Order of British Empire for Gallantry, following an incident in which he was instrumental in rescuing an injured man whilst climbing on Mont Blanc. Elliott commanded 48 Field Squadron Royal Engineers from 1980. He was made a Lieutenant-Colonel in 1984 and a Colonel in 1989. He commanded 21 Engineer Regiment (1986–88) and the 6th Armoured Brigade (1990–91) as part of the British Army of the Rhine. His military staff appointments included Assistant Chief of Staff 1st British Corps (1988–90), Director of Studies at the Staff College, Camberley (1991–92), Director of the UK Higher Command and Staff Course, and the Director of Military Operations in the Ministry of Defence (1993–95). Elliott studied as a Defence Fellow at University of Southampton in 1986, leading to the award of Master of Philosophy from Cranfield University. His work, in collaboration with Professor Geoffrey Mays and Dr. Peter Smith, investigated the impact of terrorist explosive attacks on domestic and commercial buildings and suggested structural arrangements to protect against their worst effects. As a result of this work, the Institution of Civil Engineers formed a Working Party—including Elliott— which led to changes to UK Building Regulations to improve building safety in the event of a blast. In 1995, he contributed a chapter to the book \\"Blast effects on buildings: design of buildings to optimize resistance to blast loading\\". The same year Elliott was promoted to the rank of acting Major General and was appointed Military Advisor to Carl Bildt, Chairman of the International Conference on the Former Yugoslavia, playing a part in the Dayton Agreement for Peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina. On his substantive promotion to Major General in January 1996, Elliott was made Director General and Chief Executive of the newly formed UK Army Training and Recruiting Agency, with a remit to retain more recruits, including changing the historic culture of training to one more effective given the changes in gender, race, educational and social backgrounds of those enlisting. After three years he was created a Companion of the Most Honourable Order of the Bath. He then served as Chief of Staff to the Quartermaster General from 1999 to 2000, and ended his military career as the UK Director General of Doctrine and Development, retiring from active service in 2002. For his last six years of service he was a Commissioner of the Royal Hospital, Chelsea. == Later life == On leaving military service, Elliott was appointed a director of General Dynamics UK (2002–2010) and a consultant for Ove Arup and Partners (2002–12). He was a visiting professor to Cranfield University from 2002 to 2015. Elliott served as colonel commandant of the Corps of Royal Engineers from 2000 to 2008, President of the Institution of Royal Engineers from 2002 to 2007 and was a member of the Royal United Services Institute Acquisition Forum examining defence procurement. He was President of Victim Support Wiltshire, an independent charity supporting the victims of crime, from 2003 to 2009. Whilst some sources state that Elliott co-founded and chaired Purple Secure Systems Ltd, an IT consultancy from 2006 to 2009, Companies House records indicate he served as a director from 16 February 2007 to 24 April 2009. In 2012 Elliott enrolled as a Research Fellow in the Changing Character of Warfare Programme in the Faculty of History of the University of Oxford, studying under Professor Sir Hew Strachan. At the same time, he was admitted as a Research Fellow at the School of Politics and International Relations at the University of Reading and appointed an Associate Fellow of the Royal United Services Institute. His studies led to the publication of \\"High Command\\" which examined the performance of the UK's High Command during the Iraq and Afghanistan Wars from 2000 to 2010. Elliott concluded that the Service Chiefs had been set at odds by the Ministry of Defence structure, making them almost rivals, with responsibility diffuse and authority ambiguous; that the UK High Command fell into the trap of doing just enough to satisfy the demands of the hour, but never enough to deliver strategic success. The result was that in two wars success on the battlefield had eluded them, but still at great cost in lives and money. The book was positively reviewed, and won the Society for Army Historical Research's Templer Best First Book Award in 2015. He has since lectured on the subject. Eliott enjoys sailing and paragliding. He was Commodore of the Royal Engineer Yacht Club (1995–96) and the Army Sailing Association (2000–02). and President of the Joint Services Paragliding and Hang Gliding Association (1993-2002). He is a Fellow of the Institution of Royal Engineers. He was elected as a Parish Councillor of Easton Royal from 2003 to 2017. He married Margaret Bennett in 1970, with whom he had two daughters, one of whom has predeceased him. == Publications and papers == * \\"The Protection of Buildings Against Terrorism And Disorder\\".

These restrictions often lead to controversy over those who are not listed in the voting form, and as a result, they are not eligible to be nominated for an award. ==Nominees== Nominees were announced on 27 May 2018. ===Gold Logie=== { class= width=\\"50%\\" - ! width=\\"25%\\" Most Popular Personality on Australian Television -  valign=\\"top\\"  *Grant Denyer in All Star Family Feud (Network Ten) and Family Feud (Network Ten) **Amanda Keller in The Living Room (Network Ten) **Andrew Winter in Selling Houses Australia (Foxtel – Lifestyle) and Love It or List It Australia (Foxtel – Lifestyle) **Jessica Marais in Love Child (Nine Network) and The Wrong Girl (Network Ten) **Rodger Corser in Doctor Doctor (Nine Network) **Tracy Grimshaw in A Current Affair (Nine Network) } ===Acting/Presenting=== { class= width=\\"100%\\" - ! width=\\"25%\\" Most Popular Actor ! width=\\"25%\\" Most Popular Actress -  valign=\\"top\\"  *Ray Meagher in Home and Away (Seven Network) **Aaron Jeffery in Underbelly Files: Chopper (Nine Network) **Erik Thomson in 800 Words (Seven Network) **Luke McGregor in Rosehaven (ABC) **Rodger Corser in Doctor Doctor (Nine Network)  valign=\\"top\\"  *Jessica Marais in Love Child (Nine Network) and The Wrong Girl (Network Ten) **Asher Keddie in Offspring (Network Ten) **Celia Pacquola in Rosehaven (ABC) and Utopia (ABC) **Deborah Mailman in Cleverman (ABC) **Julia Morris in House Husbands (Nine Network) - ! width=\\"50%\\" Most Outstanding Actor ! width=\\"50%\\" Most Outstanding Actress -  valign=\\"top\\"  *Hugo Weaving in Seven Types of Ambiguity (ABC) **Damon Herriman in Riot (ABC) **Ewen Leslie in Safe Harbour (SBS) **Lachy Hulme in Romper Stomper (Stan) **Rodger Corser in Doctor Doctor (Nine Network)  valign=\\"top\\"  *Pamela Rabe in Wentworth (Foxtel – Showcase) **Elisabeth Moss in Top of the Lake: China Girl (Foxtel – BBC First) **Kate Atkinson in Wentworth (Foxtel – Showcase) **Kate Box in Riot (ABC) **Leeanna Walsman in Safe Harbour (SBS) - ! width=\\"50%\\" Most Outstanding Supporting Actor ! width=\\"50%\\" Most Outstanding Supporting Actress -  valign=\\"top\\"  *Hazem Shammas in Safe Harbour (SBS) **Aaron Pedersen in A Place To Call Home (Foxtel – Showcase) **Alex Dimitriades in Wake in Fright (Network Ten) **Anthony Hayes in Seven Types of Ambiguity (ABC) **David Wenham in Romper Stomper (Stan)  valign=\\"top\\"  *Jacqueline McKenzie in Romper Stomper (Stan) **Celia Ireland in Wenworth (Foxtel – Showcase) **Elsa Cocquerel in Wolf Creek (Stan) **Jenni Baird in A Place to Call Home (Foxtel – Showcase) **Nicole Chamoun in Safe Harbour (SBS) - ! width=\\"50%\\" Graham Kennedy Award for Most Popular New Talent ! width=\\"50%\\" Most Popular Presenter -  valign=\\"top\\"  *Dilruk Jayasinha in CRAM!

He studied at the Seminary of Constantinople and later theology in Rome, being ordained a priest in 1912. He initially exercised his ministry at Kutaisi and Akhaltsikhe, and from 1922 he was superior of the Servites of the Immaculate Conception monastery in Constantinople. In 1925 Batmanishvili was received by Pope Pius XI, along with a group of Eastern Catholic priests, and was appointed Apostolic Administrator (some sources indicate that he was appointed Exarch) for the Georgian Catholics of the Byzantine rite. On 16 October 1927 Batmanishvili was arrested in Tbilisi and on 16 January 1928 he was sentenced to ten years of hard labor without the possibility of amnesty, under Articles 58-6 and 58-12 of the penal code of the RSFSR, and was sent to the field of Solovki, where he arrived on February 12. In July 1932 he was accused of anti- Soviet agitation, holding liturgies and religious rituals, and transmitting information abroad on the situation of Catholics in the USSR. As a result he was isolated from the rest of the prisoners. In May 1935 Batmanishvili was transferred to work on the Kirov railway, and in June 1936 he returned to Solovki. On 14 October 1937 he was sentenced to death by the Directorate of the NKVD and executed on November 1 of that year in Medvezhegorsk.Riccardi, Andrea (2000). The secular of martyrdom (in Italian). A.

Generally, reintegration efforts seek to return children to a safe environment, to create a sense of forgiveness on the behalf of the child's family and community through religious and cultural ceremonies and rituals, and encourage the reunification of the child with his or her family. Often the first step is to reunite the former child soldier with their family and provide adequate monetary and institutional support. Access to education is one of the most requested forms of support in post-conflict environments, but is often unavailable for economic reasons. Some studies have shown that community-led reintegration is more beneficial than Western-driven trauma healing in dealing with the psychological challenges of reintegration. There is often a stigma that children who belonged to armed groups are immoral, untrustworthy, or dangerous and therefore many individuals are rejected by community members, making reintegration difficult. Reintegration efforts can become challenging when a child has committed war crimes, as in these cases stigma and resentment within the community can be exacerbated. Female child soldiers commonly face additional barriers to successful reintegration. Girls report significantly higher rates of rape and sexual abuse during a conflict and are, therefore, confronted with unique, gender-specific challenges. They often face stronger stigmatisation on their return to the community since they are often considered tainted by sexual relationships that occurred outside of marriage. They are often ostracised upon return, ridiculed, verbally and physically attacked and prohibited from marrying. ==Child soldiers== As defined by the Paris Principles, a child soldier is: > \\"...any person below 18 years of age who is or who has been recruited or > used by an armed force or armed group in any capacity, including but not > limited to children, boys and girls, used as fighters, cooks, porters, > messengers, spies or for sexual purposes. The document is approved by the > United Nations General Assembly. It does not only refer to a child who is > taking or has taken a direct part in hostilities.\\" Child soldiers can take on many roles, including active fighting, acting as spies or lookouts, or acting in support roles, such as medic, porter, cook, or agricultural labourer.Conflict Prevention and Reconstruction Unit. \\"Child Soldiers: Prevention, Demobilization, and Reintegration\\" May 2002 While some child soldiers are abducted and forced to serve, others choose to serve. In many countries choosing to serve in an armed group is the best alternative for the child. Many children join the military because these groups will provide food, shelter, and a sense of security. For instance, in the Democratic Republic of Congo, the choices facing children are often “to join the military, become a street child, or die” (Refugees International 2002). Similar situations face children throughout the world, with cited instances in Columbia and Sri Lanka. There is often a stigma that children who belonged to armed groups are immoral, untrustworthy, or dangerous and therefore many individuals are rejected by community members, making reintegration difficult. Former soldiers often have to fabricate “second stories” and live in fear of their former identity being discovered and it leading to loss of status, discrimination, exclusion, or even retaliation.There are also two areas of reintegration that warrant special consideration: female child soldiers and drug use among child soldiers.Norman Davies, Rising '44: The Battle for Warsaw, Pan Books 2004 p.603 Child soldiers under the influence of drugs or who have contracted sexually transmitted diseases require additional programming specific to their unique needs. ==Reintegration== Child Soldiers International defines reintegration as: > \\"The process through which children formerly associated with armed > forces/groups are supported to return to civilian life and play a valued > role in their families and communities\\" To facilitate the disarmament, demobilisation, and reintegration of former members of armed groups, the United Nations introduced the Integrated DDR Standards in 2006.[2] Disarmament, demobilisation and reintegration (DDR) are applied strategies for executing successful peacekeeping operations, especially after civil wars. Disarmament entails the physical removal of the means of combat from ex-belligerents (weapons, ammunition, etc.), demobilisation entails the disbanding of armed groups, and reintegration describes the process of reintegrating former combatants into civilian society, reducing the possibility of a resurgence of armed conflict. DDR programmes usually have a number of components including a focus on psycho- social care, the return of ex-child soldiers to education, job training, and supporting local initiatives, usually through various regional partnerships). Such programmes usually aim for children to either go back to their families or be placed with foster families. Programs that aim to rehabilitate and reintegrate child soldiers, such as those sponsored by UNICEF, often emphasise three components: family reunification/community network, psychological support, and education/economic opportunity.Conflict Prevention and Reconstruction Unit. \\"Child Soldiers: Prevention, Demobilization, and Reintegration\\" May 2002 These efforts take a minimum commitment of 3 to 5 years in order for programs to be successfully implemented. Generally, reintegration efforts seek to return children to a safe environment, to create a sense of forgiveness on the behalf of the child's family and community through religious and cultural ceremonies and rituals, and encourage the reunification of the child with his or her family. Reintegration efforts can become challenging when a child has committed war crimes, as in these cases stigma and resentment within the community can be exacerbated. In situations such as these, it is important that the child's needs are balanced with a sense of community justice.Conflict Prevention and Reconstruction Unit. \\"Child Soldiers: Prevention, Demobilization, and Reintegration\\" May 2002 If such situations are not addressed children face an increased likelihood of re- enlistment. == Reintegration programme components == ===Family reunification=== Often the first step in the reintegration of child soldiers is family unification, that is reuniting the former child soldier with their families and providing adequate monetary and institutional support. When this is not possible attempts can be made to place former child soldiers in foster families or to assist the former child soldier with independent living. In Angola a family reunification project was implemented entitled \\"self-building program\\" which supported former child soldiers and their families in constructing a house.Beth Verhey, \\"Child Soldiers: Preventing, Demobilizing, and Reintegrating\\", Africa Region Working Paper Series No. 23, World Bank: November 2001, p. 16 There may be concerns as to whether the family will accept the child after they have been a soldier. In Uganda this acceptance was assisted through the use of cleansing ceremonies, which assisted in the removal of community stigmatisation by \\"decontaminating\\" the child. === Community support and acceptance === A former Ugandan child soldier retrained as a bricklayer Community networks can also be instrumental in the reintegration of former child soldiers with their families and communities. Reintegration programs often aim to find a constructive social role for the former child soldier. Working in partnership with local NGOs can be important for capacity-building and to facilitate sustainable efforts that will last after international actors have left. In Angola a community-based network called Catechist has a partnership with approximately 200 churches. The Catechist was perceived as being neutral, having a sense of authority, and adherence to international humanitarian law. Given this, the network, respected by the community, has the capacity for outreach and was able to provide ongoing support the reintegration process. The broader community has also been witness to and a victim of the armed conflict. A focus on community healing is also an aspect of reintegration, because community healing can lead to community acceptance. Many armed conflicts occur among collectivistic societies and therefore this can be a better-suited approach. By involving the community in the healing processids outsider imposition of values and understanding. Before community healing can occur a more comprehensive approach is needed to remedy many systemic problems in war zones such as the short supply of water, food, shelter and other basic necessities. There is often a lack of professional, institutional, and economic support for this form of family and community reintegration. ===Psychological support=== As part of their training child soldiers undergo a process of asocialisation and, consequently, may be resistant to changing their identity from that of a child soldier. Studies have shown that psychosocial approaches, a psychological process that takes place in the community, are more beneficial than Western- driven trauma healing in dealing with the psychological aspects of reintegration. Some of these approaches encompass emotional expression, group and individual counselling, cultural rituals, social reconstruction and emotional reintegration. These psychosocial approaches support physical health as well as cognitive, emotional and moral development. Through partnerships with local NGOs clinical psychologists are often able to train locals to administer these interventions empowering the community more directly in the healing process, instead of silencing local healers and local practices. Given this reintegration programs emphasise the opportunity for former child soldiers to establish trusting and consistent relationships with adults and also emphasise a family-based environment. Traditional rituals and family and community mediation can help to address the antisocial and aggressive behaviour a child soldier may have developed, and help the child recover from stressful and traumatic experiences. ===Education and economic opportunity=== Education and economic opportunities help former child soldiers to establish new identities for themselves and to empower them to take active control of their lives. Access to education is one of the most requested forms of support in post-conflict environments. It is often unavailable for economic reasons. Access to formal education remains a challenge for a multitude of reasons as the need to earn an income can supersede the desire for education, families may not be able to afford education, schools are often destroyed in conflicts, teachers may have fled or have been killed, or there may be difficulty in obtaining documentation to enroll in educational institutions. In addition child soldiers frequently feel shame for their actions or there is resentment between the former child soldiers and their classmates. It is important to strike a balance between education and economic opportunities. Key aspects of striking this balance often include the creation of accelerated education programmes which suit the needs of the former child soldiers, focusing education on approaches that can generate income, such as market-appropriate vocational training and the inclusion of child soldier reintegration in the post-conflict economic policy of the country in question. == Female child soldiers == Girls report significantly higher rates of rape and sexual abuse during a conflict and are, therefore, confronted with unique, gender-specific challenges. They often face stronger stigmatisation on their return to the community since they are often considered tainted by sexual relationships that occurred outside of marriage. They are often ostracised upon return, ridiculed, verbally and physically attacked and prohibited from marrying. Between 1990 and 2002, female soldiers were involved in internal armed conflicts in 36 countries. In countries such as Angola, El Salvador, Ethiopia, Sierra Leone, and Uganda as many as 40% of child soldiers were female. In Colombia many girls joined armed groups for ideological or financial reasons. Being in with love with an existing soldier is also a common reason cited. In Colombia and Cambodia girls are also often given as “tax payment” by parents. While serving as part of a fighting group is a traumatic experience for any child, the gender of the child must be taken into account in order to ensure that both males and females get effective help. Local anecdotes suggest that females are often referred to as “wives”, “rewards for soldiers’ valor”, or victims of social terror. Other common roles include spies, porters, or minesweepers. A 13-year-old fighter from Honduras reports: > Later I joined the armed struggle. I had all the inexperience and the fears > of a little girl. I found out that girls were obliged to have sexual > relations to alleviate the sadness of the combatants. And who alleviated our > sadness after going with someone we hardly knew? === Health and psycho-social effects after reintegration === This former DRC child soldier first picked up a gun when he was 12. Since demobilising, his community has largely welcomed him back. Evidence has shown that female soldiers are released (as part of a DDR program) at lower rates than male soldiers.[1] Many female child soldiers suffer from a variety of health effects including pregnancy and birth complications, vaginal and cervical tearing and sores, and those relating to gender inequalities such as poorer health care, heavier workloads, and less freedom.[1] Other health effects include STDs and HIV which may be passed down during pregnancy, childbirth or breastfeeding. The consequences of pregnancies depend on the practices of the armed group concerned. Females could either be encouraged to carry the pregnancy, to create future fighters or be forced to abort. After childbirth female soldiers are often required to give their child to peasants to raise, to be reclaimed when he or she reaches fighting age. During reintegration many female former child soldiers experience a variety of negative psycho-social effects. For example former Sierra Leonean female child soldiers were more likely to experience depression, anxiety, and lowered self-confidence than their male counterparts.Betancourt, Theresa S.; Borisova, Ivelina I.; de la Soudière, Marie; Williamson, John (2011). \\"Sierra Leone's Child Soldiers: War Exposures and Mental Health Problems by Gender\\". Journal of Adolescent Health. 49 (1): 21–28 – via Elsevier Science Direct. Reintegrated females often do not desire to enter into any marital relationships, sometimes choosing to withdraw from men altogether. This often results in further social stigma and increased societal isolation. Female child soldiers may be additionally stigmatised by their family or community for having had sexual relations and/or children out of marriage.Verhey, Beth (2004). Reaching the Girls: Study on Girls Associated with Armed Forces and Groups. Save the Children UK and the NGO Group: CARE, IFESH and IRC. Retrieved 21 February 2017. They may not want to participate in DDR programmes as this would draw attention to their association with an armed group.Save the Children. Forgotten Casualties of War: Girls in armed conflict. 2005. Retrieved 21 February 2017. DDR programs can also be too militarised to attract female enrolment; for example by failing to provide childcare, women's clothes or sanitary supplies.Mazurana, Dyan E.; McKay, Susan A.; Carlson, Khristopher C.; Kasper, Janel C. (2002). \\"Girls in Fighting Forces and Groups: Their Recruitment, Participation, Demobilization, and Reintegration\\". Peace and Conflict: Journal of Peace Psychology. 8 (2): 97–123 – via OhioLINK. ==Case studies== ===Colombia=== The Colombian armed conflict involves a number of groups including the Colombian government’s National Army, guerilla groups (such as the National Liberation Army and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia), and paramilitary groups such as the United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia. In 2004 Colombia ranked fourth for the highest use of child soldiers in the world. there are about 5,000–14,000 children in armed groups in the country (Watchlist 2004, Watchlist 2012). Current DDR programs in Colombia are carried out by the Colombian Family Welfare Institute (ICBF) and have focused on a post-conflict framework. Former Colombian child soldiers reported the most difficult parts of reintegration as being the transition from rural to urban life, reuniting with their families, and being removed from a context of organised armed violence. Existing DDR programs in Colombia predominantly focus on protecting former soldiers from each other, rather than addressing the fear and stigma that each group suffers. Many in Colombia have viewed the services granted under DDR programmes as granting impunity to these individuals for former crimes. Instead, advocates have pushed for a public awareness through campaigns and advocacy in order to eliminate existing stigma (Thomas 2008). ===Sierra Leone=== Sierra Leone endured a civil war from 1991 to 2002. Child soldiers played a key role in the Revolutionary United Front and a lesser role in government forces and various militias. UNICEF states that during this period 84,666 children were officially documented as missing. The conflict seemed to come to an end with the signing of the Lome accord in 1999, but fighting did not cease until 2000. The disarmament and demobilisation portions ended in January 2002. The rehabilitation and reintegration process focused primarily on community-based solutions. The main goal was to reunite children with their families. To this end a number of Interim Care Centers (ICCs) were established and administered by child protection NGOs. These ICCs sought to serve as temporary stops for children while their families was identified. 98% of demobilised children were reunited with one or both parents, older siblings or extended family. ICCs kept children for no longer than six weeks before returning them to family or foster care. ICCs began the process of rehabilitating former child soldiers into society. They separated them from the command structures that dominated much of their lives re-accustomed them to domestic life. This included performing chores, living to a normal schedule, receiving an education, and playing with other children. Notably, the ICCs were not focused on providing formal, western psychotherapy sessions and less than 100 children received therapy. Reintegration centred on easing former child soldiers back into their communities. Parents and family members were often eager to welcome back children who had been child soldiers. To help them, various NGOs provided local family classes on how to deal with children who had been traumatised by the war. The local community, on the other hand, was less accepting of these children and often attacked aid workers for being associated with child soldiers. This did not apply to children who were part of the pro-government Civil Defense Force, which was widely seen as helpful by local communities. Wider social acceptance is shown in studies to have been crucial in easing trauma for child soldiers. To this end, communities were educated as to the traumas experienced by child soldiers as well as given help to organise traditional cleansing ceremonies. Additionally, children who were branded with symbols of the groups who abducted them were given plastic surgery to remove scars or tattoos. Beyond this, schools received additional funding in order to incentivise the intake of former child soldiers. 92% of the participants in UNICEF’s formal DDR program were males. Former female child soldiers were often not included out of personal shame or due to not being combatants. Many female children were used for sex or married in bush weddings. These marriages tended to keep females isolated and their husbands would often not allow them to engage in rehabilitation programmes. ICCs were often separated by gender leading to female former child soldiers reporting instances of harassment or assault by males. ===South Sudan=== The Second Sudanese Civil War (1983–2002) was fought between the central Sudanese Government and the Sudan People’s Liberation Army (SPLA). In 2005 a comprehensive peace agreement (CPA) was signed by both parties. The immediate release of all child soldiers was supposed to occur after the signing of the CPA, but this did not occur. Some, but not all, child soldiers were released from the SPLA. DDR policies were developed to help former soldiers and create a more stable infrastructure aimed at ensuring safety for the future. Creating the DDR policies was difficult because neither the government nor the SPLA shared the numbers or demographics of their soldiers. Child soldiers were labelled a \\"special group\\" and in the drafting of the interim disarmament demobilisation and reintegration programme (IDDRP) they were given special protections. After the signing of the CPA policy-makers began working on a multi-year DDR program. The DDR programmes included health checks, education opportunities, employment opportunities, bundles of supplies, and other services. After DDR began to be implemented it was discovered that most of the people who were being chosen to participate were not actually active members of the military. Therefore many of the people who had left the ranks of the military were being drawn back in order to take part in the DDR program. Largely the DDR efforts for child soldiers in South Sudan failed, mainly due to remaining tensions and a likelihood of continued war. In 2013, the conflict resumed in South Sudan after the president and vice-president declared war on each other. the war is still ongoing. In 2015 there were a reported 16,000 children being used by armed groups in South Sudan. Due to the armed conflict, in 2015 more than half of elementary- and primary-school-aged children were not receiving an education. Researchers have argued that education is vital in preventing re- recruitment, but accessing education is difficult for demobilised former child soldiers because of the effects of war, socioeconomic status, and a lack of educational structures. Children in South Sudan who have participated in or been involved with the conflict report feelings of isolation, stigma, and exclusion. == See also == * Children in the military * History of children in the military * Impact of war on children * Paris Principles (Free Children from War Conference) * Children in emergencies and conflicts * Children's rights * Stress in early childhood ==References== == External links == * \\"Reintegration\\", Child Soldiers International * \\"Child soldier numbers doubled in the Middle East in 2019\\", Article: Middle East Institute * \\"End Child Soldiering\\", Podcast: Middle East Institute Category:Children in the military Category:Aftermath of war Category:Military disbanding and disarmament Category:Military sociology ","title":"Rehabilitation and reintegration of child soldiers"},{"id":"56635109","text":"Aleksey Zhelonkin (born 21 January 1966) is a former, Russian, male long- distance runner who competed in marathons.

Rabbi Kleinman was succeeded as senior rabbi in 1986 by Jerald M. Brown. Rabbi Brown inspired the building of an education center, introduced confirmation for 11th graders, and initiated Tuesday morning Torah study, which continues to the present day. Rabbi Barry M. Lutz, who became the temple's senior rabbi in 2008 and led congregational trips to Israel and sites of Jewish historical interest in Central Europe, left TAS Northridge in 2017 to pursue other interests. Two interim rabbis followed: Rabbi Liat Yardeni-Funk from January through June 2018, and Rabbi Arturo Kalfus from July 2018 through June 2020. On July 1, 2020, Rabbi Rebecca Hoffman became the senior rabbi at TAS Northridge. Rabbi Hoffman, a native of the San Fernando Valley, is a graduate of the University of California at San Diego, where she majored in Judaic studies. She earned a master's degree in education at American Jewish University, and was ordained as a Reform rabbi through Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion. The cantor is Dr. Kenneth Cohen, and Rabbi Dalia Samansky is the educational director. Rabbis in the larger Jewish community whose families were members of TAS Northridge and who spent part or all of their formative years at the synagogue are: Liora Alban, Benjamin Berger, Shawna Brynjegard-Bialik, Leah Doberne-Schor, Jason Gwasdoff, Jonathan Klein, Adam Lutz, Dalia Samansky, Lisa Vernon and Rebecca Birken Yussman. Cantor Rachel Goldman also grew up at TAS Northridge. ==Activities== Temple Ahavat Shalom Northridge is a full-service congregation. The temple has its own preschool, which is currently closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Hebrew school, Sunday school, youth choir, and bar and bat mitzvah training are available for children of elementary- and middle- school age. The synagogue youth group is known as TASTY, for Temple Ahavat Shalom Temple Youth. Confirmation is celebrated by students in the 11th grade, who are also invited to take part in an annual educational trip to Washington, DC. Social action and adult education programs take place throughout the year. These include Sisterhood, MoTAS (Men of Temple Ahavat Shalom), weekly Torah study, adult choir, a Caring Community to assist congregants who are ill, bereaved or otherwise in need, collection of food items and other goods for deserving individuals or families, periodic blood drives, and a monthly book discussion group.

Acyl-protein thioesterases are part of the α/β hydrolase superfamily of proteins and have a conserved catalytic triad. For that reason, acyl-protein thioesterases are also able to hydrolyze oxygen-linked ester bonds. == Function == Acyl-protein thioesterases are involved in the depalmitoylation of proteins, meaning they cleave off palmitoyl modifications on proteins' cysteine residues. Cellular targets include trimeric G-alpha proteins, ion channels and GAP-43. Moreover, human acyl-protein thioesterases 1 and 2 have been identified as major components in controlling the palmitoylation cycle of the oncogene Ras. Depalmitoylation of Ras by acyl- protein thioesterases potentially reduces Ras' affinity to endomembranes, allowing it to be palmitoylated again at the Golgi apparatus and to be directed to the plasma membrane. Acyl-protein thioesterases, therefore, are thought to correct potential mislocalization of Ras. == Known enzymes == {   } Currently fully validated human acyl-protein thioesterases are APT1 and APT2 which share 66% sequence homology. Additionally there are a handful of putative acyl-protein thioesterases reported, including the ABHD17 enzyme family. In the lysosome, PPT1 of the palmitoyl protein thioesterase family has similar enzymatic activity as acyl-protein thioesterases. == Structure == 319x319px Acyl-protein thioesterases feature 3 major structural components that determine protein function and substrate processing: 1. A conserved, classical catalytic triad to break ester and thioester bonds; 2\\\\. A long hydrophobic substrate tunnel to accommodate the palmitoyl moiety, as identified in the crystal structures of human acyl-protein thioesterase 1, human acyl-protein thioesterase 2 and Zea mays acyl-protein thioesterase 2; 3\\\\. A lid-loop that covers the catalytic site, is highly flexible and is a main factor determining the enzyme's product release rate. Mechanism of how acyl-protein thioesterases release their product by using a flexible lid-loop covering the substrate binding tunnel. Nature Communications 8(1):2201, Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License, https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/ == Inhibition == The involvement in controlling the localization of the oncogene Ras has made acyl-protein thioesterases potential cancer drug targets. Inhibition of acyl-protein thioesterases is believed to increase mislocalization of Ras at the cell's membranes, eventually leading to a collapse of the Ras cycle. Inhibitors for acyl-protein thioesterases have been specifically targeting the hydrophobic substrate tunnel, the catalytic site serine or both. == Research == Current approaches to study the biological activity of Acyl-protein Thioesterases include proteomics, monitoring the trafficking of microinjected fluorescent substrates, the use of cell-permeable substrate mimetics, and cell permeable small molecule fluorescent chemical tools. == References == Category:Cell biology Category:Lysophospholipases Category:Peripheral membrane proteins Category:Post-translational modification ","title":"Acyl-protein thioesterase"},{"id":"56635179","text":"Alejandra Ortega (born 8 July 1994 in Mexico City) is a female racewalker from Mexico.

While having its origins in ESL teaching in the US, and then as an early EFL resource in Japan, the series is currently in general use for English- language learners in over 160 countries around the world. The series is now in its 5th edition, which was released in 2019, although the 3rd series is still in print. == Development == The series was written by two (at that time) US- based EFL/ESL teachers and two Asia-based teachers. Ritsuko Nakata gained a BA from the University of California in Los Angeles, and has been involved in ELT for over 30 years, and is currently President of IIEEC, Teacher Training Center for English Teachers of Children, and President of AETC, The Association of English Teachers, based in Japan.
