As a result of poor health, she was forced to retire in 1885 although she returned to make a few appearances in the 1890s. Early life and family Born on 5 October 1855 in Copenhagen, Augusta Sophie Wilhelmine Schou was the daughter of Jens August Hammerich (1820‚Äì97) and Sophie Frederikke Iversen (1822‚Äì76). At the time of her birth, her mother was called Schou as the result of her previous marriage. On 6 August 1880, Augusta Schou married the naval officer Otto George L√ºtken (1849‚Äì1906). She had three children: Ellen (1881), Otto (1882) and George (1883). Career After training under Carl Helsted (1818‚Äì1904), L√ºtken made her d√©but at the Royal Theatre in 1876 as Vilhelmine in √âdouard Du Puy's Youth and Folly (Ungdom og Galskap). Exhibiting an unusually high and clear soprano delivery, she immediately attracted attention. The tall, slender blonde impressed her audiences even more as the Queen of the Night in The Magic Flute, as Zerlina in Don Giovanni and as Susanna in The Marriage of Figaro. While she had a fine natural singing voice, she was less gifted as an actress. As a result of her limitied schooling, her performances in London and Stockholm were not well received. By contrast, in Copenhagen she continued to please her audiences with coloratura performances of Gilda in Rigoletto and Marie in Donizetti's La fille du r√©giment. As early as 1885, she had to retire as a result of problems with her legs. In the 1990s, she made a few guest appearances including Venus in Tannh√§user and Isabella in Meyerbeer's Robert le diable but her voice was no longer what it had been and she appeared to have lost her good humour. Augusta L√ºtken died in Copenhagen on 26 September 1910.

It can also be used to remotely operate electronic equipment such as beacons, laser markers, and radios. RAMS was developed by a team of researchers led by James Chopak at the Army Research Laboratory from 1996 to 2000. The system consists of a transmitter and two different types of receivers, one to initiate blasting caps and one to initiate C4 directly. RAMS was designed to serve as a more portable and convenient alternative to conventional remote activation systems like the model XM-122, which was considered too big, heavy, and fragile for efficient use. In addition, the XM-122 was limited in its range (about 1 km) and relied on very large high capacity batteries. In contrast, the RAMS weighed only a couple pounds and its microprocessor-based transmitter was powered by at most seven standard 9-volt batteries. The device was capable of reaching a range up to 2 kilometers, and the combination of the crystal filter in the receivers and the FM detector circuit made it possible to maintain high signal sensitivity at a low power consumption rate. In addition, the RAMS was operational in harsh environments with temperatures as low as -25 degrees F and as high as 140 degrees F. It was also capable of functioning when submerged in saltwater, up to depths of 66 feet.Andrejkovics, R., Chopack, J., Brann, H., Hopkins, John, Tobin, R., & Fraser, W. (2003). United States Patent No. US 6,546,873 B1. Washington, D.C. However, testing performed by the Army Research Laboratory have found that due to the low power levels of the RAMS receiver‚Äôs electrical signals output, the system has demonstrated a noticeable level of unreliability in performance past a certain distance.Land, D.G. (2008). United States Patent No. US 7,451,700 B1. Waltham, MA. More modern versions of the RAMS can weigh as little as three powers and can reach a range of more than 5 kilometers, allowing operators to stand farther away from the blast at a safer distance.

Life Born in Paris, she became a pupil of Jacques-Louis David and in June 1806 became engaged to Jean-Dominique Ingres. However, Ingres left for Rome that September and the engagement did not survive until his return to France, since he won the first prize for painting in 1801 and thus had to stay in Rome. She exhibited at the Paris Salons of 1802, 1810, 1812, 1814 and 1819.

The handheld MI-RAMS receiver consists of a box-shaped device with a fixed bulkhead-style receptacle connector on the top with a non-leaking metal shell threaded in the rear section of the connector and sealed with an O-ring. With the use of quasi-static AC magnetic fields, MI-RAMS is capable of sending signals through ice, rock, soil, water, and concrete. As a result, MI- RAMS is often used to remotely control ordnance items and communication systems in areas in which radio frequency devices under-perform or fail. These areas include caves, bunkers, tunnels, dense jungle, ice fields, urban structures, and up to 66 feet underwater. The wireless channel created by MI- RAMS does not produce any far field (RF) emissions, which decreases likelihood of detection outside of the operating area. The MI-RAMS transmitters and receivers have also been designed to work with existing communication technology, allowing other types of handsets to link to the system and communicate with each other as long as one MI-RAMS unit is present. MI-RAMS was designed and modified by researchers at the Army Research Laboratory for U.S. Army Combat Engineer Forces and Army and Navy Special Operations Forces (SEALs) to aid in establishing terrain dominance.

C. Gotch, featuring his daughter Phyllis Maureen Gotch Phyllis Marian Gotch (1882‚Äì1963), also known as Phyllis Maureen Gotch and in later life as Marquise de Verdi√®res, was the only child of Newlyn-based artists, Caroline Burland Yates and Thomas Cooper Gotch. She featured in several of her father's paintings, one of the most famous being The Child Enthroned. She later became a singer, a published author and campaigned for community issues in Newlyn. After the death of her first husband in 1918 she married Andre, Marquis de Verdi√®res. Following their divorce in 1935 she married her cousin once removed, Jocelyn Bodilly, who became Chief Justice in the Western Pacific. Background Gotch's parents met at the Slade School of Art, where they were studying, and they married in Newlyn on 31 August 1881. Gotch, who was their only child, was born in Paris, France, on 6 September 1882. She was initially cared for by a nurse and relatives, whilst her mother recovered from an illness. Later she travelled extensively with her parents, including trips to the continent. In 1892 she was baptised in NewlynOriginal data: England, Births and Christenings, 1538-1975. Salt Lake City, Utah: FamilySearch, 2013.Name: Phyllis Marion Gotch; Gender: Female; Baptism Date: 19 Dec 1892; Baptism Place: St. Peter's, Newlyn, Cornwall, England; Father: Thomas Cooper Gotch; Mother: Caroline Burland and in 1894 she became a boarder at St Katherine's School, St Andrews, Scotland. Early career In 1903 she wrote and illustrated a book for children called The Romance of a Boo-Bird Chic, which was followed up in 1904 with another called Tuffy and the Merboo. In about 1909 she became editor of the Penzance Church of England High School and Old Girls‚Äô Club magazine called Merry Maidens, published by Eleanor Hare. It was a high-quality publication with illustrations by local artists, including Charles Simpson and Laura Knight. Other books she wrote included: Once I had a home: the diary and narrative of Nadejda, lady of honour to Their Imperial Majesties the late Empress Alexandra Feodorovna and the Empress Maria Feodorovna of Russia. Published 1926, though her claim to be its author has been challenged. By Prince Serge Obolensky in \\"One man in his time\\" (Hutchinson of London, 1960) page 147; he appears in the book as Prince Orolinsky and attributed it to a Narishkin cousin. She later wrote Golden Hair under the name of Marquise de Verdieres (Falise Maureen de Verdieres) published 1938. In about 1904 Gotch started her classical singing career. She studied with the opera singer Charles Santley, who was a friend of the Gotch family. She was said to be a mezzo-soprano and her early repertoire included classical works that were interposed with some traditional English songs. By 1910 she had formulated a stage act performing the folk songs whilst dressed in a ‚Äúquaint puffed and flowered gown of the Georgian period‚Äù. She also started to use the name Phyllis April Gotch. In 1911 she took her act to South Africa to fulfill an engagement but she was not well received. She was forced to modify and adapt her routine, and gradually won over the audiences.Cornishman - Thursday 13 April 1911; From Penzance to Johannesburg Marriage Patrick Doherty Whilst in South Africa, Gotch met an old friend from Cornwall called Richard Ernest Biggs Doherty (\\"Patrick\\"). They had last seen each other in April 1911 when Doherty was staying with the Gotch family in Newlyn.Original data: Census Returns of England and Wales, 1911. Kew, Surrey, England: The National Archives of the UK (TNA), 1911. Street address: Wheal Betsy Cottage, Newlyn, Penzance He was born in County Cork in 1882, M.A. at Trinity College, Dublin, and for a period had been a Lieutenant in the Royal Munster Fusiliers. His sister, Jessica Florence Doherty, had married Cornish-based artist Frank Gascoigne Heath in 1910. Gotch and Doherty, who was by now employed as a mining engineer, married in South Africa on the 11 March 1913. In 1914 Gotch travelled to England for a holiday, leaving her husband behind. Due to the declaration of war on Germany in August of that year, she was unable to return to South Africa. She also discovered at this time that she was pregnant and her child, Deirdre Patricia Maureen Doherty (Patsy), was born on 16 March 1915 in Cornwall. She never saw her husband again because he died in Cradock, Cape, South Africa on 2 September 1918.Original data: Cape Estates Death Index. Records of the Master's Office / Orphan Chamber, Cape Town. Cape Town Archives & National Archives, Cape Town; Name: Richard Ernest Edward Biggs Doherty; Death Date: 1918 Patsy was Gotch‚Äôs only child. During the First World War, Gotch helped form the local Women Volunteer Motor Drivers (WVMD) at Moretonhampstead, Devon, becoming its first Lady Commandant.  Andre, Marquis de Verdi√®res In 1922 she married Andr√© Marie, Marquis de Verdi√®res in St George's, Hanover Square, London. In her biography of Thomas Gotch, The golden dream: a biography of Thomas Cooper Gotch, author Pamela Lomax says that Phyllis met Marquis de Verdi√®res in St Tropez in 1921, and both \\"thought they had found wealthy partners\\". The wedding announcement in French newspapers named him as Andre Schlossmacher de Verdi√®res. The title, Marquis, in France is often just a courtesy title used by children of French nobility and in this case probably relates to the family of de Verdi√®res' mother, who referred to herself as Dame Mathilde Icard De Verdieres, a descendant of the Raismes family. Gotch often stayed at her parents‚Äô house in Newlyn called Wheal Betsy. It was constructed as a family home, completed in about 1909 and included a studio and gallery. The Arts & Crafts style building was named after the adjacent disused mine workings called Wheal Elizabeth. After her marriage, Gotch and her new husband Andre, found accommodation in Zennor. However, their marriage was short lived; they separated in 1928 and divorced in 1935. One consequence of this marriage to a French national was that she lost her British nationality, and in 1937 she had to apply for a British Naturalisation Certificate. Naturalisation Certificate: Phyllis Maurean de Verdieres. From France. Resident in Penzance. Certificate AZ10873 issued 30 October 1937; National Archive Gotch's divorce from de Verdi√®res was on the grounds of his adultery and the suit was undefended.Extract for divorce papers The National Arcives Ref:J77/3389/3466 Soon after they parted he wrote to Gotch explaining that he had grown fond of a woman in Finland, where he had been teaching. Later in 1934 it became known that he was living with an American woman in Hotel de Luteze, Paris. This woman was American widowed actress, Mildred Arden, married name Mildred Blandy, daughter of actor Edwin Hunter Arden. She returned to America at the start of WWII whilst de Verdi√®res remained in France. The 1940 census for Rye, Westchester, New York, confirms that she was resident in Paris, France, in 1935. In America she became known as Marquise Mildred de Verdieres and died in Austin, Texas, aged 69 on the 14 December 1955. The death certificate gave her name as Mildred A de Verdi√®res and her status as widowed.Texas Department of State Health Services; Austin Texas, USA; Source Information: Ancestry.com.

In the book Je suis le chat qui va tout seul... about the life of young French resistance fighter Fran√ßois Raveau, there is mention of a man he knew during the war called Andr√© de Verdi√®res, real name Schlossmacher who became a mentor to him. Another reference to de Verdi√®res in the war is taken from war diaries of Louis Christiaens and Lucie Christiaens-Hecquet, published in an article in XIe Colloque des Amis de Cadouin 2015; here he is named as Schlosmacher [sic], alias marquis de Verdi√®res and located in the Dordogne area. Jocelyn Bodilly In 1936, Gotch married barrister Jocelyn Bodilly (1913-1997), who was thirty years her junior.Cornishman - Thursday 21 July 1938 He was the son of Ralph Burland Bodilly (1894-1961) and Sybil Sacr√© (1879-1959) who were both cousins of Gotch (see section Family below). Jocelyn's paternal grandfather was Cornish artist, Frank Bodilly, who trained to become a lawyer, and in 1904 was appointed a Judge in the High Court of Calcutta, India. Jocelyn‚Äôs father Ralph was also in the legal profession and was appointed chief magistrate of Tel Aviv, Palestine in 1933.In 1934 Palestine, magistrate Ralph B. Bodilly committed Stavsky, Rosenblatt and Achimeier for trial in the criminal assizes court on charges of the premeditated murder of Haim Arlosoroff.

Gotch would have known Jocelyn since the day he was born. In 1922 two of his sisters, Ursula and Godefer (aged 10 and 12), were junior bridesmaids at her wedding to Andre, Marquis de Verdi√®res, and Jocelyn at this date would have been nine.Cornishman - Wednesday 19 July 1922; Newlyn Wedding in London Gotch visited her future father-in-law, Ralph Bodilly, in Tel Aviv in 1933/34 and wrote an illustrated article on her impressions of the area, the people and the politics, published in the Daily Telegraph on the 14 February 1934.Cornishman - Thursday 22 February 1934 It was later reproduced in other newspapers.Ralph Burland Bodilly was Gotch's father-in-law (and her cousin) but was also younger than her by about a year, having been born on 25 November 1884. Newlyn After the First World War plans were set in place in Britain to improve the housing stock throughout the country. Local authorities were instructed to clear slum dwellings and rebuild with improved standards and sanitation. In Newlyn this resulted in proposals to knock down the family homes of the fishing community around the harbour. The residents of these homes fought to stop them being destroyed and Gotch, who by now was a local councillor, supported them and handled the publicity. To raise the profile of their campaign one of the local fishing vessels named Rosebud was sent from Newlyn, round the south coast of England, and up the Thames to the Houses of Parliament to deliver a petition to the Minister of Health. During the Second World War, Gotch lost her seat on the council for non attendance. After the war she stood again but was not elected. Gotch died in Hong Kong on 24 April 1963. She is buried with her parents in Sancreed Churchyard. Her husband, Jocelyn, remarried to physiotherapist Marjorie Fogg (1922-1996) in St John's Cathedral, in Hong Kong on 1 August 1964.\\"Marriages.\\" Times [London, England] 6 Aug. 1964: 1.

In some versions of his legend, he was one of the disciples of Jesus Christ, who was sent to preach the Gospel in Lusitania. Legend According to the most well-known version, known from at least the 16th century, he was born in Rome and, converting to Christianity, went to Jerusalem, where he was able to meet Jesus Christ and be one of His disciples. Mantius would even have participated in the Last Supper and witnessed Pentecost. He would have been, therefore, among the seventy disciples. After the crucifixion of Jesus, he was sent out as a missionary of the Gospel and, after passing through Gaul (where he performed a miracle in the name of Jesus in the town of Ch√¢lons-en-Champagne, restoring to life a young man of nobility who had drowned), continued into Hispanic lands and arrived in Lusitania. He preached in the Alentejo region, where he would have converted many people, and arrived at √âvora, where he would have established a Christian community, presided over by him as the first bishop. A later tradition also has Mantius travelling to Lisbon and founding a new community there, also becoming their first bishop. Neither of the two traditions has historical basis, and both dioceses date from around the 4th century. Roman persecution of Christian communities would have Mantius imprisoned; after refusing to offer sacrifices to the pagan gods, he was martyred near √âvora, traditionally in the site nowadays occupied by the civil parish of S√£o Man√ßos. Veneration The first written reference to Saint Mantius dates back to 1195, and devotion to the saint spread in the end of the 13th century, possibly following the arrival of his presumed relics in Castile. According to the same tradition, the relics of Saint Mantius were in the church of S√£o Man√ßos but, in order to save them from Muslim invaders, they were brought in 714 to Asturias as were the remains of other saints. In 1070, Gutierre T√©llez de Meneses would have had a dream in which Saint Mantius told him to take his relics to Castile. Thus the relics arrived at what today is Villanueva de San Mancio, in the province of Valladolid, near Medina de Rioseco, Spain; the authorities would not let him enter the town with the saint's remains, so the knight founded a monastery on the outskirts, with the support of the Benedictine monks of Sahag√∫n, where the relics were left ‚Äî the town subsequently grew around the monastery. In the last Roman Martyrology he is called \\"martyr\\" and is said to die in the VI century.

It weighs less than four pounds, and consists of a mechanical appendage made out of carbon-fiber composite that has one end attached to a carbon fiber plate that fits inside an armor plate pocket and the other end attached to a Picatinny rail on top of the gun. It was to increase permit more accurate use of heavier weapons and reduce fatigue by displacing the weight of the weapon from their arms to their torso and mitigate firing recoil. As of 2018, the Third Arm is a prototype and is still in the testing phase of its development.  History  The development of the Third Arm began in 2015 as a collaborative effort in ARL‚Äôs Human Research and Engineering Directorate (HRED) and Weapons & Research Materials Directorate (WMRD). The project was an attempt to improve the marksmanship of soldiers by finding ways that would make the use of heavier, more lethal firearms and larger bullets easier to manage. The first prototype of was built in 2016 and first unveiled to the public in March 2017 at the Association of the United States Army (AUSA) conference in Huntsville, Alabama. A pilot study was conducted in summer 2017, where the prototype was tested with six soldiers who wore electromyography sensors that recorded muscle activity with and without the Third Arm. The results indicated that the device improved shooting accuracy and lessened muscle fatigue. A second prototype was constructed based on the soldiers‚Äô feedback. Changes included the mounting location, the additional of an extendable hinge plate that adhered to different body types, and refinements to the design that made it easier for the wearer to dive into the prone shooting position.  Applications  The Third Arm can be used to completely take off the weight of heavy firearms such as the 17-pound M249 light machine gun or the M240B machine gun from the holder‚Äôs arms. By supporting the weapon‚Äôs weight, soldiers are capable of operating the firearm with one hand and leave the other hand free to do a different task. In addition, it can be used to carry a breaching saw or a shield instead of a gun. Testing has shown that the Third Arm provides immediate stabilization during movement, allowing for improved marksmanship.

Episodes Production The series was renewed for a ninth season in January 2018. Along with the renewal, it was announced that showrunner Scott M. Gimple would be promoted to chief content officer for both The Walking Dead and its spin-off show Fear the Walking Dead, while writer and co-executive producer Angela Kang would take Gimple's role for The Walking Dead. Filming for the ninth season began on April 30, 2018, with Greg Nicotero directing the first episode of the season. Michael Cudlitz, who played Abraham Ford, directed the seventh episode of the season. The ninth season features a redesigned opening credits sequence. The animated title sequence, which is graphic novel inspired, features familiar imagery such as Daryl's motorcycle and crossbow, and Michonne's katana. Kang spoke of the inspiration for the new sequence, \\"The feel of the season has elements of the Western genre. We're paying homage to some of the iconic moments from the graphic novel. Life is coming out of death. Nature's taking over, while other things are crumbling.\\" Casting The ninth season is the final season of series lead Andrew Lincoln Most of the cast's contracts had to be renewed for the ninth season and beyond, and most of the cast did re-sign; the notable exception was Lauren Cohan who plays Maggie Greene. Cohan had sought a pay increase from AMC given her high demand from other networks; while she had signed on to star in a new series, Whiskey Cavalier, for the ABC network, this contract would still enable her to participate on The Walking Dead in a limited role. In April, Cohan confirmed she signed on for the ninth season and appeared in the first five episodes. At the end of the eighth season, former regular Lennie James (as Morgan Jones) was moved to The Walking Deads companion series, Fear the Walking Dead, as showrunner Scott M. Gimple felt there were more stories about Morgan to tell that would be more effective with Fear the Walking Deads smaller cast and narrative approach. In May 2018, it was announced that Avi Nash and Callan McAuliffe, who joined the series in the eighth season as the recurring roles of Siddiq and Alden, respectively, were promoted to series regulars. In late May, it was reported that the ninth season would be the final season for Andrew Lincoln, who plays lead character Rick Grimes. Lincoln said that as he lives in England and shooting a season takes six months or more, he believed it was time to leave the series to be able to spend more time with his growing children. However, he expressed desire to direct an episode in season ten, and shadowed director Michael E. Satrazemis during the ninth-season episode \\"Guardians\\". In July 2019, it was confirmed Lincoln would not direct in season ten due to scheduling conflicts. Following the broadcast of Lincoln's last episode, AMC announced their plans to create three AMC Original Films to explore events related to Rick's character in the future, starring Lincoln, and with the first expected to begin production in 2019. Besides Lincoln, Pollyanna McIntosh (Jadis / Anne) will also star in these films. Lauren Cohan also announced that this would be her last season on the series, appearing in the first five episodes as Maggie Greene before her departure. Alongside other acting commitments, Cohan felt she had become too comfortable in the role, and it was time to move on. She appreciated the opportunity to explore Maggie in her last few episodes, and has not ruled out returning for future seasons based on her future commitments. In October 2019, it was confirmed that Cohan would return in season 11 as a series regular. In June 2018, it was reported that Jon Bernthal would reprise his role as Shane Walsh for a guest appearance in the ninth season. In July 2018, it was reported that Lauren Ridloff, a deaf actress, would join the series in the ninth season playing Connie, a deaf survivor who communicates through sign language. Also in July 2018, during San Diego Comic- Con, it was announced that Samantha Morton was cast in the series regular role of Alpha, the leader of the Whisperers, a villain from the comic book series. Several other recurring roles were announced as well, played by Brett Butler, John Finn, Rhys Coiro, Dan Fogler, and Zach McGowan. On October 6, 2018, the day before the season premiere, the showrunners affirmed Bernthal's return as Shane, as well as Sonequa Martin-Green and Scott Wilson returning to reprise their roles as Sasha Williams and Hershel Greene, respectively, at the New York Comic Con. Wilson died later that day due to leukemia; however, according to Comicbook.com, Wilson had filmed his scenes previously to be broadcast during the first half of the season. The ninth season also features the departures of series regulars Xander Berkeley (Gregory), Tom Payne (Paul \\"Jesus\\" Rovia), Katelyn Nacon (Enid) and Alanna Masterson (Tara Chambler). Berkeley's character is killed off in the first episode of the season, which was adapted from the comic book. Payne's character is killed off in the mid- season finale, which introduces the Whisperers. This was a major departure from the original comic, where Jesus is still alive, and the actor explained, \\"It's an amazing show and I was so honored to be a part of it, but at the same time, being the same character without anything fun to do is a bit frustrating.\\" Nacon's and Masterson's characters are killed in the penultimate episode of the season; their deaths were adapted from the comic book in which Rosita Espinosa and Ezekiel are among several killed by the Whisperers. Writing Promotional poster for the second half of the season, featuring Samantha Morton as Alpha Angela Kang stated that the season would include a timeskip, which coincides with the comic's narrative after the \\"All Out War\\" arc. She stated that they were aiming to give the series a \\"fresh look and feel\\", and \\"focusing a lot on the core character relationships in the show that have kind of been long-lasting, as well as all of our wonderful series regulars\\". Kang said that the season would \\"explore what happened as man made objects and structures break down\\" and \\"what happens as resources are getting low\\", giving the season a Western feel. Actor Tom Payne, who portrays Paul \\"Jesus\\" Rovia, said the timejump is about a year and a half from the end of the eighth season, giving enough time for survivors to re-establish farming and livestock raising. A second timeskip occurs towards the end of episode 5, after a helicopter whisks a wounded Rick to safety. The next scene takes place six years later, when a now much older Judith saves a group of survivors from a ring of walkers. Design This season introduces the Whisperers, a group of human survivors that have created skins and masks out of walkers that allows them to move among and manipulate walker hordes. For these masks, director Greg Nicotero wanted to change the appearance from the way they are shown in the comic, which gave the masks a type of melting look. Nicotero also did not want to give these masks a look similar to Leatherface's from The Texas Chain Saw Massacre. Instead, they opted to make the Whisperers masks immovable similar to Michael Myers' from the Halloween series, which according to Nicotero, \\"you cannot judge any kind of emotion\\". Release The teaser for the season was released on July 19, 2018, the first day of the 2018 San Diego Comic-Con. The trailer was released on July 20, 2018. The ninth season premiered on October 7, 2018, and the episode was made available a day early via AMC Premiere, the network's on-demand service. The mid-season premiere was made available a week earlier, on February 3, 2019, via AMC Premiere. Reception Critical response The ninth season received positive reviews, particularly credited to new showrunner Angela Kang The ninth season of The Walking Dead was met with a positive reception, with critics noting its improvement over the two previous seasons. On Rotten Tomatoes, the season holds a score of 91% with an average rating of 7.22 out of 10, based on 20 reviews. The site's critical consensus reads, \\"Nine seasons in, The Walking Dead feels more alive than ever, with heightened tension and a refreshed pace that rejuvenates this long-running franchise.\\" On Metacritic, the season has a score of 72 out of 100 based on 4 critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". Reviewing the season premiere, Sarah Moran of Screen Rant wrote the episode \\"feels like the fresh start the series so desperately needs, trading grim wartime for a more peaceful period of growth and reflection\\" and praised the changes made by new showrunner Angela Kang. Erik Kain of Forbes called the first episode \\"the best episode since season 6 and better than many in that season as well.\\" Brandon Davis of Comicbook.com wrote a highly positive review based on the first three episodes, praising the more character-driven narrative. In another review from Comicbook.com, Cameron Bonomolo also praised the first three episodes of the season, writing, \\"The Walking Dead is now a political drama viewed through the lens of a zombie apocalypse, turning greater focus to more complex character-driven conflict that is at its strongest since the Frank Darabont-led first season.\\" Bonomolo also called the third episode \\"jaw-dropping\\" and that it \\"delivers some of the finest mystery and drama the show has ever seen in its eight-year run.\\" Jeff Stone of IndieWire wrote a positive review based on the first three episodes and gave them an \\"A-\\" grade. He called the ninth season a \\"huge step up for the show\\" and that the episodes \\"are as strong as anything the show's done since the heyday of Season 4.\\" The penultimate episode \\"The Calm Before\\" received critical acclaim from critics. In the episode, several characters are killed off; including main characters Enid and Tara Chambler. Alex McLevy writing for The A.V. Club praised the episode, with a qualification of A- and in his review he said: \\"At best, 'The Calm Before' could be a memorial for what this show has been as it heads toward a new future, a reminder of what it used to look like during its strongest seasons, before reshuffling the undead chessboard of its major players and changing up the nature of its structure and stories. \\"Warning Signs\\" showed this was possible, and the Whisperers are an ideal foil by which to engage in some ambitious new ways of dealing with these characters and communities as they enter a new era of existence. True, this show hasn't demonstrated anything like the kind of consistency that would point to such a maneuver; continuing its uneven mix of soap-opera melodrama and intriguing experiments in post-apocalyptic thrills is the likely progression. But as we close the book on season nine and look to the show's 10th(!) year, this was an excellent reminder of what got us all tuning in in the first place.\\" Ratings Notes References External links * * * Season 9 Category:2018 American television seasons Category:2019 American television seasons ","title":"The Walking Dead (season 9)"},{"id":"57893701","text":"Irena Radoviƒá Irena P.

History Copies of the work are mentioned in Piedmont in the early 16th century and the Piedmont-born painter Giovanni Martino Spanzotti mentioned it as a \\"tabuleto fiorentino\\" in a 1507 letter to Charles II of Savoy. Several other studio copies of the painting were made between 1507 and 1526, four of which are still known to survive, including one at the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam and one in the Walters Art Museum in Baltimore, USA. The original work remained in the collection of the Dukes of Savoy until the 17th century. Christine of France bought four Raphael paintings in 1647, probably including this one. The work then vanishes until 1729, when it is mentioned in the Recueil d'estampes commissioned by Pierre Crozat as belonging to a man called Passart then passing to abb√© Fran√ßois de Camps (1643-1723), scholar and bishop of Pamiers, and finally to Philippe d'Orl√©ans (1674-1723).

In 1798, the whole collection was sold in London to Lords Bridgewater, Gower and Carlyle, though they then resold the Madonna, which was then acquired by the collectors Hibbert in London in 1799, Nieuwenhuys in 1831 in Brussels and Delamarre or de Lahaute in Paris. Next it was acquired by marquis Aguado in 1835 and finally by the businessman and parliamentarian Fran√ßois Delessert (1780-1868). Delessert's collection was sold a year after his death and the Madonna was acquired by Henri d'Orleans, Duke of Aumale, who hung it in the 'Santuario' of his ch√¢teau de Chantilly, alongside Three Graces and a panel by Filippino Lippi. category:1507 paintings category:Raphael Madonnas category:Paintings of the Mus√©e Cond√© Category:Paintings formerly in the Orleans Collection ","title":"Orl√©ans Madonna"},{"id":"57893781","text":"Tineovertex melliflua is a moth of the family Tineidae first described by Edward Meyrick in 1911.

It has hairless and leathery inverted lance-shaped to oblong leaves tipped with mostly three or four teeth and flattened egg-shaped flowerheads of 9‚Äì12 cm (3.6‚Äì4.8 in) in diameter, that consist of initially yellowish orange flowers that later changing to salmon pink. From the center of the flowers emerge almost straight styles that jointly give the impression of a pincushion. It is called Piketberg pincushion in English. Flower heads can be found between late September and December. It is a endangered species, only known from three close locations in the Western Cape province of South Africa.  Description  Leucospermum profugum is an evergreen, creeping shrub af up to 4 m (13 ft) across, with an exposed, stern rootstock of 4‚Äì12 cm (1.6‚Äì5 in) thick, from which several unbranched creeping stems extend of 2‚Äì4 m (8‚Äì16 ft) long, woody and over a considerable length mostly leafless at base, 2‚Äì3 cm (¬æ‚Äì1¬º in) thick sometimes covered with same cork, and 4 m across. It grows from a single main stem of up to 10 cm (4 in) thick, and has a smooth, grey bark. The flowering stems often have a bow shape, with the flower heads emerging at a right angle. The soon hairless leaves are inverted lance-shaped to oblong, 3‚Äì5¬Ω cm (1.2‚Äì2.2 in) long and 6‚Äì8 mm (¬º‚Äì‚Öì in) wide, having a rounded or cut-off tip with three or four teeth. The leaves are usually pointing upwards and often bent somewhat towards the base of the branch. The flattened egg-shaped flower heads of 9‚Äì12 cm (3.6‚Äì4.8 in) in diameter are set on a stalk of up to 3‚Äì3¬Ω cm (1.2‚Äì1.4 in) long, and arranged individually at a richt angle to the stem. The common base of the flowers in the same head is cone-shaped with a pointy tip, 2‚Äì2¬Ω cm (0.8‚Äì1.0 in) long and 1‚Äì1‚Öì cm (0.4‚Äì0.6 in) across. The bracts that subtend each flower head are lance-shaped with a pointy tip, 5‚Äì7 mm (0.20‚Äì0.28 in) long, cartilaginous in consistency, and covered with densely matted woolly hairs. The bract that subtends each flower individually is egg- to heart-shaped, about 11 mm (0.44 in) long and 8‚Äì9 mm (0.32‚Äì0.36 in) wide, and the upper end very densely set with woolly hairs, with the tip abruptly pointy and 4‚Äì5 mm long. The 4-merous perianth is 3¬Ω‚Äì4 cm (1.4‚Äì1.6 in) long, initially yellowish orange but later changing to salmon pink. The lowest, fully merged, part of the perianth, called tube, is about 1¬Ω cm (0.6 in) long, at 1‚Äì1¬Ω mm (0.04‚Äì0.06 in) narrow and hairless near the base but expanded and widened and minutely powdery higher up, where it is 3¬Ω‚Äì4 mm (0.14‚Äì0.16 in) diameter. It is keeled on the side facing the edge of the head. The upper part (or limbs), which enclosed the pollen presenter in the bud consists of four lobes, each about 4 mm (0.16 in) long and 1¬Ω (0.06 in) wide and carries hard, stiff rust-coloured hairs. From the perianth emerges the style that bents towards the center of the head and tapers towards its tip, is 4¬Ω‚Äì6¬º cm (1¬æ‚Äì2¬Ω in) long. The thickened part at the tip of the style called pollen presenter is narrowly egg-shaped or cone-shaped with a pointy tip and about 1 mm (0.04 in) long, with a groove acting as the stigma skewed to the side of the center of the head. The ovary is subtended by four orange, awl-shaped scales of 4‚Äì5 mm (0.16‚Äì0.20 in) long.  Differences with related species  Unlike other creeping Leucospermum species, the Piketberg pincushion has longer styles of 4¬Ω‚Äì6¬º cm, and large, 3‚Äì5¬º cm long, quickly hairless, inverted egg- to lance- shaped leaves, with mostly three or four teeth near the tip. The habit of the Piketberg pincushion differs rather strikingly from that of its trailing relatives in that it produces only a few main unbranched stems, of up to 4 m long across the rocks and the surrounding vegetation. These emerge from a woody rootstock that is usually exposed and grows in the cracks between the rocks.  Taxonomy  As far as known, a Miss C. Edwards was the first to collect the Piketberg pincushion for science in 1914, and John Patrick Rourke described the Piketberg pincushion in 1970. The species name profugum is a Latin word meaning \\"fleeing outward\\". L. profugum has been assigned to the section Tumiditubus.  Distribution, habitat and ecology  The Piketberg pincushion can only be found on the southern slopes of the Piketberg, between Aasvoelkop and Versveld's Pass, at an altitude of 350‚Äì750 m (1200‚Äì2500 ft). The species only occurs in well-drained conditions, like rocky outcrops or small koppies made of Table Mountain Sandstone. It grows alongside low Restionaceae, Diosma vulgaris, Rhus africana and Leucadendron glaberrimum.  Conservation  The Piketberg pincushion is considered endangered, because only three locations are known where it can be found, within an area of only , and are potentially under threat due to too frequent fires.

The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places, but was demolished in 1980, and removed from the list in 1981. Description The Fix House was a 1-1/2-story brick structure, built in the style of French-Canadian vernacular cottages. The original main section measured 24 by 30 feet, and is of brick on a limestone foundation. This main section had a center entrance flanked by two windows. A wing was later added to one side, and a porch was added to the rear. Only fifteen buildings were constructed in this style in Monroe County, which was first settled by French pioneers in the 1780s. History The land where the Fix house stood was inhabited before the War of 1812. In 1828, Joseph Fix emigrated with his family from Alsace-Lorraine to Monroe. Joseph died the next year. In 1832 his widow, Ann, purchased this property and farmed it with her son George. Ann and George constructed new buildings, likely of log construction. The house was built in 1853, with side wings added in about 1870. George Fix lived in the house until his death in 1898, after which his son Leanus took over the farmstead. Leanus Fix owned the property until his death in 1960. In 1966, the state acquired the property as an addition to Sterling State Park. However, the house was uninhabited and continued to deteriorate. The house was demolished in 1980.

It is now in the Mus√©e Cond√©. It is first definitively recorded in the inventory of the collections of the Palazzo della Pilotta in Parma in 1708, meaning it originated in the Farnese collection, which had been in the Palazzo del Giardino in Parma since at least 1680. It was probably acquired by the Farnese family as a result of confiscations early in the 17th century. The whole Farnese collection was sent to Naples in 1734 after Charles of Bourbon's accession as king of Naples. He had inherited it from his mother Elisabeth Farnese, wife of Philip V of Spain. The work was inherited by Leopold, Prince of Salerno, son of Ferdinand I of the Two Sicilies. In 1854 Leopold's collection was sold in its entirety to his nephew Henri d'Orleans, Duke of Aumale, then in exile in Britain - Portrait was then still attributed to Romano. He brought it to France in 1871 and hung it in his ch√¢teau de Chantilly. The current attribution was first mooted in 1932 by Bernard Berenson, though Felton Gibbons's monograph on the painter preferred to see it as a studio copy after a lost autograph original - Gibbons also argued it was a pendant to Portrait of a Man (Fitzwilliam Museum). Portrait of a Woman was restored in 1984, showing much retouching, restoring the original colours and confirming it as an autograph Dossi work. The very linear eye is characteristic of the painter and can also be seen in his Portrait of a Man with Five Rings (Royal Collection, Hampton Court) and Portrait of a Soldier (Fogg Art Museum). The treatment of costume details is also reminiscent of the women in Dossi's Allegory of Hercules (Uffizi) and Portrait of a Man (Louvre).

It was publicly introduced on 12 July 2018, after nine years of development. The aircraft is intended to be supplied complete and ready-to-fly. The manufacturer claims that the design is the world's first ultralight fixed-wing, all-electric, vertical take-off and landing aircraft. Investors in the company include Google co-founder Larry Page. Development The first proof-of-concept version was flown on 5 October 2011, in Warkworth, Ontario, Canada, by Leng. He flew the next model, named the BlackFly, in August 2014 and then relocated the company to Palo Alto, California in September 2014. In February 2016, the second BlackFly prototype was first flown. By September 2017, the prototype had flown in a series of flights of at least each. The first pre-production aircraft was flown in October 2017. The design is intended for the FAR 103 Ultralight Vehicles category in the US and the Basic Ultralight Aeroplane category in Canada. The US version and international versions will have different ranges, speeds and weights to comply with national regulations. In discussing the design in person with Leng at AirVenture in July 2018, AVweb reviewer Paul Bertorelli indicated that it is \\"a terrific idea and I‚Äôm betting the concept itself has legs, whether Opener‚Äôs version fails to gain a market or not\\", but expressed concern about the lack of pricing and \\"cost/value relationship\\" marketing overreach. However he did indicate that \\"It‚Äôs early in their game and they have a long developmental road ahead before selling these things.\\" Bertorelli also expressed concern that the company did not allow journalists access to look over the aircraft and would not answer any technical questions. Design The aircraft is made from carbon-fiber reinforced epoxy with all- electric battery-powered propulsion. It has two cantilevered tandem wings, on the front and rear of a short fuselage. The fuselage has a single-seat cockpit under a bubble canopy. The forward wing is low, and the rear wing high, giving the cockpit good forward visibility. Each wing has four tractor configuration contrarotating propellers powered by electric motors. The tractor configuration prevents the flexible propellers from contacting the airframe. Each wingtip has winglets to improve lateral stability and reduce vortex drag. The aircraft weighs empty and can carry a pilot and baggage totaling . It can accommodate a pilot of up to in height. A ballistic parachute is optional. The aircraft is not a tiltwing or tiltrotor design, instead, the entire aircraft changes pitch. When the aircraft is parked, both wings and their motors are canted up at about 45 degrees. To ascend vertically, the aircraft pitches up 45 degrees, so that the propellers pull vertically. The wing-mounted tractor propellers move air over the wings, reducing stall speeds. So, at pitch angles near zero degrees, the aircraft can fly slowly with high angles of attack. For efficient horizontal flight, the aircraft pitches down 45 degrees, canting the wings and propellors to an optimal angle of attack. The forward wing has a slightly lower angle of attack to aid stall recovery. At low speeds the forward wing will stall first, causing the nose to fall, increasing air speed and exiting a stall. The take-off and landing distances are 36 inches. The landing gear consists of a rub-strip on the bottom of an amphibious hull and a small rubber bumper on the rear of the fuselage. The lower edge of the winglets are skids that limit the vehicle's roll when parked. The vehicle is designed to fly from a grass surface, but can also be flown from fresh water, asphalt, snow and ice. Pilot controls are a joystick with a thumb control for altitude. Flight controls are triple-redundant fly-by-wire controlling the motors and dual elevons on the outer edge of both wings. Differential motor speeds provide control authority in pitch, roll and yaw. Elevons also permit control in an efficient unpowered glide mode. The elevons are in the prop-wash of the outer propellers, enhancing their roll and pitch authority at low speeds. Flight stability is software-controlled, with modes for cruise- control, \\"return-home,\\" auto-land and geo-fencing. Most flight testing was unmanned, operated by software with a test weight in place of a pilot. Each motor weighs and produces of thrust. There are two batteries per motor, located in the wing, behind each motor. Adjacent batteries can be cross- connected for redundancy. The batteries are software-monitored.

Early and family life Born in 1809 in rural Laurens, Otsego County, New York to Mary Greene Carr (1789-1845) and her husband George Carr (1786-1858), he was descended on his father's side from colonial Rhode Island governor Caleb Carr. David G. Carr married Hannah Burnside (1811-1855) by 1833, and they had 3 sons and 3 daughters before the family moved to Dinwiddie County, Virginia, where Carr had purchased 380 acres near San Marino.Gunter 3:28. However, his wife died of cancer on February 10, 1855. After her death Carr returned to New York, where he married widow Susan M Walker (1820-1882), who also moved to Dinwiddie County with him, and with whom he had a daughter, Hannah (b. 1859).1860 U.S. Federal Census for Dinwiddie County, Virginia district 1.

Charles H. Carr did move to Virginia with his parents, but he and his wife (whom he married in 1856) lived nearby in Petersburg, and they had a daughter and son before Charles was conscripted into the 41st Virginia Infantry in March 1862. By May private Carr was hospitalized at Camp Winder hospital in Richmond because of dysentery, and he committed suicide with a revolver the following month while ill with typhoid fever.William D. Henderson, 41st Virginia Infantry (Virginia regimental histories series ) p. 94Another Charles H. Carr volunteered for the 5th New York infantry in May 1861, but died of disease supposedly at his mother's home in New York in July 1862. Career David Carr became active in the Republican party after the American Civil War, perhaps embittered by his elder son's conscription and death, or his daughter-in-law's move with the young grandchildren back to New York. Petersburg and Dinwiddie County had become battlefields, especially late in the war, and Carr later filed documents for tools, grain and hogs (among other items) destroyed or taken by Union troops from his farm.U.S. Union Provost Marshals' papers 1861-1867 p. 850 of 1982 available on ancestry.com In the first postwar election, in which emancipated blacks were a majority of the county's voters, David Carr and William Reed were elected to represent Dinwiddie and neighboring Prince George county at the Virginia Constitutional Convention of 1868.Richard L. Jones, Dinwiddie County: Carrefour of the Commonwealth (Dinwiddie County Historical Books Commission, 1976) pp. 162-163 Carr had overwhelming support from African American voters, and chaired the Committee on Pardoning Powers and Committee on Currency, Banking and Insurance Companies, but seldom spoke during the public sessions. In January 1868 he introduced a resolution proposing to close the Virginia Military Institute and distribute the proceeds to fund public schools.Jane Dailey, Before Jim Crow: the politics of race in post-emancipation Virginia (University of North Carolina Press 2009) p.22 and endnote 40 an p. 177 Delegate Carr also supported proposals disenfranchising Confederate officers and officials (which voters failed to approve) the following year.Gunter 3:28. Occupying military authorities appointed Carr an election registrar in 1869. Voters in Dinwiddie and neighboring Greensville and Sussex counties easily elected Carr to the Virginia Senate in 1869 (the first election after adopting the new state constitution).Cynthia Miller Leonard, The General Assembly of Virginia: 1619-1978 (Richmond: Virginia State Library 1978) pp. 506,511 The Petersburg Index grouped Carr with carpetbaggers, notwithstanding his nearly two decades of residence in the county, perhaps in part because he succeeded George W. Bolling (1806-1875), of the long locally prominent Bolling family, who had received a prompt pardon from President Andrew Johnson despite his namesake son's Confederate military service and had won the seat in 1865. In 1869 Carr was nominated as the customs collector in Petersburg, and Congress confirmed his appointment on April 21, 1870. Carr then gave his farm to his son Henry (who had married in 1867) and moved to Petersburg, but Henry Carr died in 1873. In the 1871 election, the Senatorial district's voters replaced Carr with William N. Stevens, a free-born black lawyer and Republican politician who would represent Sussex County and adjoining areas for much of two decades.William D. Henderson, The Unredeemed City: Reconstruction in Petersburg, Virginia: 1865-1874 (University Press of America 1977) p. 97 President Rutherford B. Hayes returned David Carr to his customs post in 1877, and he held the position until shortly before his death.Gunter 3:28.

It is now in the Mus√©e Cond√© in Chantilly. It was commissioned on 16 February 1452 by the 'procureurs' of the Augustinian monastery for Pierre Cadard, in honour of his father, the doctor Jean Cadard (1377-1449). Jean had been counsellor to Charles VII of France and went into exile in the Comtat Venaissin after being accused of having John the Fearless assassinated in 1419. It was intended as the altarpiece for the chapel of Saint Pierre of Luxembourg, which Jean Cadard had had built for the √©glise des C√©lestins in Avignon. The contract for the painting included a predella but did not specify its subject - it is now lost, but according to tradition it showed Christ surrounded by the twelve apostles. An upper panel is also now lost. The next record of the work dates to 1823, when it was in the family collection of Jean-Baptiste Rousseau, French consul to Baghdad. It was then bought by the Louvre curator Fr√©d√©ric Reiset, at which time it was described as a late 15th century Flemish primitive work.

Plot Tiger is inspired by the true story of Pardeep Singh Nagra, a practicing Sikh man who was banned from the sport of boxing due to his religious beliefs. Pardeep fights back with the support of his coach and mentor (Mickey Rourke) and a community lawyer (Janel Parrish). Obstacles faced include racial profiling by public officials, overtly racist threats, jealous rival boxers and pressure to change from loved ones. It is within the course of these challenges, and at his weakest moment, that he discovers love (Janel Parrish).

It opened on 29 July 1965 and closed on 13 January 1986.  History   First owner - Edward Milborrow  Knaresborough Zoo was opened on the 29th July 1965 by Edward Milborrow, a former pet shop owner and circus ringmaster. Edward Milborrow had two young daughters, Ella and Jane Milborrow who spent a lot of time on site with the animals, they appear in many of the old photographs that have been shared of the zoo, an article about Knaresborough Zoo by York Press has a photograph of both girls sat within a penguin enclosure. When Knaresborough Zoo opened it held many varieties of animals including elephants, chimpanzees, bats, otters and exotic birds. One famous chimpanzee who lived at Knaresborough Zoo was named Enoch, this animal had appeared in the 1957 BBC television series The Silver Sword. Knaresborough Zoo was popular with both local residents and tourists visiting the town, in an archive article by the Harrogate Advertiser, the local newspaper of Knareborough at the time, states that within the first four days of opening the zoo attracted 4,000 people despite poor weather conditions. In 1969 Milborrow left his role as zoo director to become a taxidermist, the Zoo was bought by Associated Pleasure Parks who owned Flamingo Park (now Flamingo Land).  Second owner - Nick Nyoka  After the departure of Milborrow, Knaresborough Zoo was then taken over Stockton-born Adrian Darley who lived with his wife Barbara and son Leo. Darley was better known by the pseudonym Nick Nyoka. The inspiration for the surname Nyoka comes from the Swahili language where it translates to the word 'snake'. Before coming to Knaresborough Zoo, Nyoka managed and ran animal shows at many zoo's throughout England including Colchester Zoo, footage of his performances can be found online through various film archive sites. Nyoka ran Knaresborough Zoo up until the closure of the site in 1986. When Nyoka took over Knaresborough Zoo he brought larger animals including lions, tigers, leopards, snakes and Himalayan brown bears. These animals were seen as being more dangerous than the animals that had previously been housed at Knaresborough Zoo during the time when it was owned by Milborrow. Two of the animals that Nick Nyoka kept at Knaresborough Zoo were listed in the Guinness Book of Records for their unbelievable sizes. The most famous animal that lived at Knaresborough Zoo was Simba, a male African lion who weighed 826 lbs (pounds) and had a shoulder height of 1.11 m (44 in). Before moving to Knaresborough Zoo he resided at Colchester Zoo. Residents of Knaresborough who lived in the town during the period of time Simba was at the zoo have recalled memories of hearing the lion roar early in the morning or late at night. Some sources claim Simba the lion was the lion that appeared in the film Cleopatra alongside Elizabeth Taylor in 1963. There are two different reports about what happened to the body of Simba after he died. A clip from the BBC television series Antiques Road Trip uploaded onto YouTube under the title 'SIMBA-WORLDS LARGEST LION' shows a stuffed lion behind glass casing alongside a photo of Nyoka which suggests he was preserved. However an anonymous comment on a blog about Nyoka and Simba claims this isn't true and the lions body is buried on the Knaresborough Zoo site. Another famous animal that Knaresborough Zoo housed during Nyoka's time was a python named Cassius, this snake weighed 220 lbs (pounds) and measured 27'4\\" in length. In July 1983, Nyoka was convicted by Harrogate Magistrates Court for Gross indecency with a nine year old boy, for this he was fined ¬£400. Nyoka died in 1996 and an obituary for him is listed in Issue 54 of the magazine Tanzanian Affairs.  Closure  Knaresborough Zoo closed on 13 January 1986 after facing a series of financial difficulties and also the refusal of a license to operate by the local council. An inspectors‚Äô report in the years before closure rated the zoo as ‚Äútotally inadequate‚Äù, points of criticism in the report were the standard of the animal enclosures and the level of hygiene in the zoo. On 8 October 1986, nine months after the closure of Knaresborough Zoo the BBC broadcast a documentary called Animal Squad which showed the closure of the zoo and the attempts to rehome the 300 animals that lived there. Sid Jenkins, one of the RSPCA inspectors who was put in charge of dispersing the animals wrote up this experience in an autobiography titled Animals Have More Sense which was published by Fontana Press in 1988, two years after the documentary was shown. Many of the animals were rehomed in Twycross Zoo, Leicestershire. Other animals were taken on by Suffolk Wildlife Park (now known as Africa Alive!). On 17 January 1986, four days after the closure of Knaresborough Zoo, Suffolk Wildlife Park put in an appeal to rehouse a lion named Satan, this appeal took 5 months to complete but was successful and on 20 June 1986 Satan arrived in Suffolk. The same park also rescued a pair of dingoes from Knaresborough Zoo when it closed. Four mammals were not able to be rehomed. Two adult bears, a lion and a blind Puma. These animals were euthanised before their bodies were carried and placed in a skip. The local council disposed of them.  Incidents  In June 1983 a Bengali tiger was shot dead by police after it escaped from its enclosure. The tiger had killed and mauled several other animals in the zoo. In a retirement statement from North Yorkshire Police, an officer named Mike Thompson was described to have taken part in this specific firearms incident. Three python snakes worth approximately ¬£950 were stolen from Knaresborough Zoo in 1983, Nick Nyoka's wife Barbara described the snakes as \\"bad-tempered\\" and warned that they had a tendency to bite, this led to fears for public safety. It is not public information about whether the pythons were returned to the zoo.  Use of the site today  Even though the zoo closed in 1986 nothing was done with the location until the late 1990s when it was acquired by the Henshaw's charity, an organisation which supports individuals with sight loss and other disabilities. The Knaresborough Zoo buildings and enclosures were demolished and an Arts and Crafts Centre was built, this first opened to the general public on 25 April 1999 and is still used today as an educational facility and a place for local events to be held including live music nights. The crafts produced at Henshaw's still reference the zoo history of the location, for the 2017 Spring Flower Show in Harrogate the organisation created a design which included a sculpture of a lion named Simba. A blue plaque was placed on the outside of the Arts and Crafts Centre building by Knaresborough Civic Society in 2014 with a small paragraph about the zoo.  In popular culture  On a building opposite Knaresborough bus station there is an animal themed mural which covers the first and second floor windows. It is titled Zoo and was painted by Julie Cope in 2007. The mural shows a zebra and a giraffe but it is unclear if these species were ever found at Knaresborough Zoo as there are no photographs or public records to evidence this. The artwork was funded by funded by three different councils which were Knaresborough Town Council, Harrogate Borough Council and the Arts Council and is part of a series of windows that tell the history of Knaresborough town.

Life of Esther or Scenes from the Story of Esther is the title of a series of six panel paintings by Sandro Botticelli and Filippino Lippi, showing scenes from the story of Esther and produced in the 1470s. They originally decorated the sides of a pair of cassoni or marriage chests, the two long panels on the fronts, and the smaller ones on the ends. They are now split between five museums in Europe and Canada.Wind, writing when some of the owners were different. The Triumph of Mordecai, National Gallery of Canada The authorship of the panels has been much discussed, without firm conclusions being reached. Many accounts divide the works between the two artists, either in terms of the different paintings, or different stages of the work, or both. After his father's death in 1469, Filippino Lippi completed his apprenticeship with Botticelli, and in 1472 was recorded as his assistant. Whether the panel known as La Derelitta, probably by Botticelli, and perhaps rather later than the others, forms part of the series, has also puzzled scholars. The figure is often thought to be female, and a scene of Mordecai weeping is already shown in the Louvre's wide panel.Wind; Marcevicius, 31‚Äì32. A recent (2010) study, based on infrared reflectography and x-ray images, shows differences between the style and techniques of the underdrawing, and also differences in the handling of the vanishing points in the perspective of the architecture. There may well have been more than two artists involved.Marcevicius, 32‚Äì34. The author concludes that La Derelitta and The Triumph of Mordecai are entirely by Botticelli, and Esther at the Palace Gate perhaps entirely by Lippi. The two wide front panels suggest a design by Botticelli, and some underdrawing, but are probably mostly by Lippi, assisted by another painter in the draperies. Vashti Rejected may be painted by a third, less expert, painter after a cartoon by Botticelli.Marcevicius, 33‚Äì35. Collections The division between the two cassoni is conjectural, based on the order of events in the biblical story, with the first one mostly covering Esther's part in the story, and the second that of Mordecai. Cassoni were typical wedding gifts, and this partial division into a female and male story would be appropriate for this. Theologians saw the relationship between Esther and Ashuerus as a prefiguration of that between Christ and his church.Marcevicius, 31‚Äì32.

The other panels were recorded in the 1850s in the Torrigiani collection, and published by Jacob Burckhardt, who attributed them to Lippi, using the designs, and perhaps the underdrawing, of Botticelli.

Hundreds of Greek-Cypriots who were frustrated at the failure of the United States to quell the Turkish forces and fearing its alleged support for Turkey started to protest and riot. The American ambassador to Cyprus, Rodger Davies, who was seeking shelter inside the embassy, was shot and killed by sharpshooters belonging to EOKA-B, a Greek-Cypriot nationalist paramilitary. from about 100 yards away. An embassy employee, Antoinette Varnava, who rushed to his aid, was also killed by a sniper bullet. In February 1977, the Cypriot government decided to arrest six EOKA-B extremists and try them for the assassination of ambassador Davies.

After a second season as a reserve player, serving as backup to the more experienced Jack Galbraith and making just five appearances, he eventually established himself in the first team at the start of the 1932‚Äì33 season after displacing William Roberts. The club struggled in the Third Division South, finishing 19th in 1933 followed by a bottom-placed finish in 1934, and Jenkins was one of several players released by new manager Ben Watts-Jones in an attempt to reverse the club's fortunes. Following his release, Jenkins was offered a contract with Tottenham Hotspur but rejected the move as he felt \\"there were better prospects in the milk business.\\" However, Jenkins returned to professional football the following season, joining Bristol City where he spent one season. He later moved to Newport County where he finished his professional career. Later life Following the outbreak of World War II, Jenkins served in the Far East and North Africa with the Royal Navy, where he was awarded the Africa Star. On his return to Britain after the war, he joined his father's milk company and became a Freemason. He also became a qualified referee. He later wrote a book on Splott in Cardiff, the area of the city that he grew up, entitled The Splott I Remember. He died on 5 August 2005 at the age of 96 in Cardiff. At the time of his death, he was the oldest surviving former Cardiff City player.

It was released in Indonesia on 19 July 2018. It was selected by Singapore as its entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 91st Academy Awards, but it was not nominated. Plot Buffalo Boys opens in the American West. Its two protagonists, a pair of brothers named Jamar (Ario Bayu) and Suwo (Yoshi Sudarso), have just finished working with their uncle on the Transcontinental Railroad. While riding a train on their journey back to Indonesia, the pair fight against a band of white gangsters‚Äîforeshadowing what‚Äôs to come. Upon arriving in Indonesia, Jamar and Suwo get caught up in the struggles of a Javanese village against an evil Dutch administrator named Captain Van Trach. Together, the brothers must fight Van Trach and his henchmen to free native Indonesians from colonial oppression. Cast * Ario Bayu as Jamar * Mike Wiluan as Mango * Yoshi Sudarso as Suwo * Pevita Pearce as Kiona * Tio Pakusadewo as Arana * Reinout Bussemaker as Van Trach * Zack Lee as Leung * Daniel Adnan as Drost * Mikha Tambayong as Sri * Alex Abbad as Fakar * Hannah Al Rashid as Adrie * Happy Salma as Seruni * Donny Damara as Sakar * El Manik as Suroyo * Donny Alamsyah as Young Arana Production Director Mike Wiluan told Medcom.id, in an interview that was published shortly before the film's premiere, he had been frustrated with colonial- themed Indonesian films being political dramas, likening it to a classroom, stating \\"We sit in the cinema for an hour or two not to jump into class or study again\\", and wanted to explore a more creative route. He came up with the idea of a cowboy western set in colonial Java first in 2014, three years before production on the film, with actor Ario Bayu being among the first to be informed of his plans. The total number of actors and crew involved with the film numbered 220 to 230 people. Pre-production On 3 July 2017, actor Tio Pakusadewo first revealed details of the film to Kompas and announced that he was set to appear in it alongside the likes of Ario Bayu, Pevita Pearce, Happy Salma, Donny Damara and El Manik. Principal photography was scheduled for 20 August 2017. The initial script for the film was roughly 150 pages before being condensed to 100 pages. The rehearsals and pre- production took about three months. Pevita Pearce stated she underwent archery training for two months. During rehearsals she trained with stuntmen from France and Thailand, and stated that riding the buffalo was a \\"very big challenge\\" for her, describing them as \\"wild\\" and harder to control than horses. Yoshi Sudarso stated that he was the last to join the cast, and had difficulty learning Indonesian, having moved to the United States at age nine where he lived for 20 years and so wasn't as fluent in the language. He spent a month learning Indonesian, but stated that costars Pevita Pearce, Hannah Al Rashid and others were helpful. Sudarso also revealed he was offered a lucrative eight-year Hollywood contract as a stuntman and had to choose between doing the film or accepting the contract. After reading the script and speaking to the director, he made the decision to work on Buffalo Boys because his \\"heart and mind was in acting, not stunts anymore.\\" Speaking to NBC News later in the month, Sudarso stated \\"Westerns are such a big part of American culture, but as Asian Americans, we never see ourselves in them.\\" Filming The film was shot on location in Yogyakarta, Java and in a studio in Batam, Riau Islands. In Yogyakarta, the production rented land in the Watu Murah area of Nanggulan, Kulon Progo. Scenes were typically shot between 3 AM and 6 PM.https://beritagar.id/artikel/seni-hiburan/film-buffalo- boys-jadi-proyek-ambisius-mike-wiluan Filming took place across 40 days. According to Wiluan, they had initially thought riding a buffalo would be easy similar to riding a horse. However, they found it to be one of the most difficult tasks. Release A teaser trailer for the film was released on 16 March 2018. The full-length trailer was released on 20 April. On 2 May, the line up for the 28th Fantasia International Film Festival was released which included a world premiere for the film slated for 14 July 2018 in Montreal, Quebec, Canada.

The company offers dog DNA testing services to consumers, breeders, and veterinarians. History Embark was founded in Austin, Texas, in 2015 by brothers Adam Boyko and Ryan Boyko, Matt Salzberg, and Spencer Wells. Prior to the formation of the company, the Boyko brothers spent nearly a decade collecting thousands of DNA samples from dogs for research into the origin of dogs and what DNA can reveal about their health. This led to the formation of Embark, which sells dog DNA tests to dog owners, veterinarians and breeders. Embark's stated goals are to help pet owners better understand their dog's health and risk for heritable diseases, and to advance canine DNA research in general. Adam Boyko is an associate professor at Cornell University College of Veterinary Medicine. Ryan Boyko, the company‚Äôs CEO, was an independent researcher at Cornell and studied computer science and biology at Harvard University. Wells, the chief product officer, directed the Genographic Project at the National Geographic Society, and Salzberg is a founder of meal delivery company Blue Apron. In March 2016, Embark launched publicly with a presentation by the Boyko brothers at South by Southwest. That year, the startup began offering its DNA tests for dogs. In 2016, Embark raised a $1.6 million seed round investment, from lead investors Slow Ventures and Aspiration Growth Fund. The company raised an additional $4.5 million in seed funding in the summer of 2017, led by Founder Collective, and including 23andMe founder Anne Wojcicki. In 2017, Embark relocated its headquarters from Austin to Boston, with its main science team remaining in Ithaca, New York. That year, the company was inducted into the McGovern Center, Cornell's incubator for life science companies. Embark is a research partner of Cornell University College of Veterinary Medicine. Criticism The company uses submitted genetic data for research unless the customer opts out, raising privacy concerns. Some veterinarians have expressed skepticism about the lack of standards in DNA testing for dogs and the difficulty in properly analyzing and understanding the data, while acknowledging the potential of genetics to treat diseases. In 2018, NPR reported on shortcomings for DNA tests for dogs, including an incorrect analysis of the genetic data that can lead to unnecessary medical treatment and questionable clinical decisions. In 2018, science journal Nature ran an article by a veterinarian and two scientists stating that \\"pet genetics must be reined in\\" to avoid misinterpreting data. Research In July 2017, Embark worked with Cornell University to test more than 6,000 dogs of various breeds in order to identify the genetic mutation that causes blue eyes, which was the first research of its kind to be conducted on non-humans. Dog owners conducted DNA tests from Embark, completed online surveys, and Embark and Cornell analyzed the data. Researchers discovered a genetic tweak in Siberian Huskies that can cause blue-eyed dogs. Adam Boyko was part of a team of scientists who in 2015 discovered that the origin of domestic dogs was near Central Asia 15,000 years ago. In 2016, he was the senior author of a study by Cornell College of Veterinary Medicine researchers that was the largest genetic study of dogs to ever be completed, with a collection of samples that included the DNA of more than 10,000 dogs from around the world. The researchers compared dogs of different purebred breeds in a large-scale genome-wide association study. It was published in the journal Nature Communication.

The church is famed for its three bells, blue dome, and picturesque views. The building is located in the town of Fira, directly above the cliffs which dominate western Santorini.  History  The site of the modern Three Bells of Fira has been occupied by a number of other buildings. In the mid-17th century, two modest cave churches were built into the-then solid cliff face. These churches were eventually destroyed as the cliff receded (due to the ongoing expansion of Fira) and an infirmary was built. This building was eventually occupied by Jesuit monks, who lived on the site until the land was given to the Bishopric of Santorini. The current church was built in 1757, and them refurbished and expanded multiple times over the centuries. The structure was heavily damaged in the 1956 Amorgos earthquake, after which the building was restored.Informational Panel in Fira, Greece, titled \\"The Catholic Church of Koimisi Tis Theotokou\\".

It is listed by the State Institute of Cultural Heritage. Elected the fourth most beautiful library in the world by Time magazine, the Cabinet has the largest collection of Portuguese literature outside Portugal. History The institution was founded in 1837 by a group of forty-three Portuguese immigrants, political refugees, to promote culture among the Portuguese community in the then capital of the Empire of Brazil. It was the first association of this community in the city. The building of the current headquarters, designed by the Portuguese architect Rafael da Silva e Castro, was erected between 1880 and 1887 in Neo-Manueline style. This architectural style evokes the exuberant Gothic-Renaissance style in force at the time of the Portuguese discoveries, named Manueline in Portugal for having coincided with the reign of King Manuel (1495‚Äì1521). The Emperor Pedro II (1831‚Äì1889) laid the cornerstone of the building on 10 June 1880, and his daughter, Isabel, Princess Imperial of Brazil, together with her husband, the Prince Gaston, Count of Eu, inaugurated it on 10 September 1887. Architecture Reading room. The fa√ßade, inspired by the Jer√≥nimos Monastery in Lisbon, was worked by Germano Jos√© Salle in lisbon stone in Lisbon and brought by ship to Rio. The four statues that adorn it portray respectively Pedro √Ålvares Cabral, Lu√≠s de Cam√µes, Infante D. Henrique and Vasco da Gama. The medallions of the facade portray, respectively, the writers Fern√£o Lopes, Gil Vicente, Alexandre Herculano and Almeida Garrett. The interior also follows the Neo-Manueliene style on the covers, wooden bookcases for books and memorials. The ceiling of the Reading Room has a beautiful chandelier and a skylight in iron structure, the first example of this type of architecture in Brazil. The hall also has a beautiful monument of silver, ivory and marble (the Altar of the Homeland), of 1.7 meters of height, that celebrates the time of the discoveries, realized in the Casa Reis & Filhos in Porto by the goldsmith Ant√≥nio Maria Ribeiro, and acquired in 1923 by the Royal Cabinet. Public and works Pedro √Ålvares Cabral's statue Opened to the public since 1900, the library of the Royal Cabinet has the largest collection of Portuguese works outside Portugal. Among the 350,000 volumes, both national and foreign, are rare works such as a copy of the \\"princeps\\" edition of Os Lus√≠adas of Cam√µes (1572), the Ordinations of D. Manuel (1521), the Capitolos de Cortes and Leys (1539), Verdadeira informa√ßam das terras do Preste Joam, segundo vio e escreveo ho padre Francisco Alvarez (1540), a manuscript of the comedy \\"Tu, s√≥ tu, puro amor\\" by Machado de Assis, and many others. Every year, it receives about six thousand titles from Portugal. There is also an important collection of paintings by Jos√© Malhoa, Carlos Reis, Oswaldo Teixeira, Eduardo Malta and Henrique Medina. Every day, it receives, on average, one hundred and fifty visitors. Among its illustrious visitors, from the past, are the names of Machado de Assis, Olavo Bilac and Jo√£o do Rio. The Royal Cabinet publishes the magazine Converg√™ncia Lus√≠ada (semester) and promotes courses on Literature, Portuguese Language, History, Anthropology and Arts, destined mainly for university students. The history of the Brazilian Academy of Letters is linked to that of the Royal Cabinet, since the first five solemn sessions of the Academy, under the presidency of Machado de Assis, were held here. Titles and honors On 5 July 1946 it was made an Officer of the Military Order of Christ. On 19 August 1947, it was made Commander of the Order of Benemerence, on 9 April 1981 it was elevated to Honorary Member of the Military Order of Christ and on 13 July 1990 was made Honorary Member of the Military Order of Saint James of the Sword. In July 2014 the library was listed in 4th place among the 20 most beautiful libraries in the world according to Time magazine. The publication highlighted its history, architecture and rich collection of lusophone works.

Ahrens studied at Tallinn University of Theology from 1811 to 1819, and, from 1820 to 1823, at the Faculty of Theology of the University of Tartu. After graduating from university, he could not hold a pastor's office because he was too young (the pastors were to be at least 25 years old), so in 1824 he went to Pikavere manor, where he worked for about 8 years. In 1831, Ahrens revised the pro ministerio exam at the Estonian Consistory. In 1832, he went to study in Germany and also visited France. On returning to Estonia, he again returned to home-schooling at Vana-Vigala (with the Sievers family). Ahrens held sermons in the Vigala church in Estonian. Ahrens was called in 1837 to be the teacher of the Laurentius congregation in Kuusalu. He was ordained a pastor on 12 September 1837. In March 1860, he was a part of the East Harju congregation.Liivi Aarma P√µhja-Eesti vaimulike l√ºhielulood 1525‚Äì1885 Tallinn 2007.Eesti Biograafiline Leksikon. K√ú Loodus, Tartu 1926‚Äì1929 In 1843, he modified the grammar of the Estonian language in the Grammatik der Ehstnischen Sprache Revalschen Dialektes (Grammar of the Estonian language in Tallinn, 2, revised edition 1853). Because of this work, he is considered to be the creator of modern Estonian orthography. The reason for his writing reforms was the desire to make reading the liturgical texts of the church easier. Ahrens noticed a widening gap between the national language and the church language as a church teacher. At the beginning of the 19th century, most of the church teachers were Germans and, on the Bible, supported German and Latin grammar. Ahrens wanted to make the church more popular. In 1853, a second edition of his grammar book was published, with sentence instruction. Ahrens proposed to switch from the old writing system to a Finnish script that was better suited to pronunciation in Estonian, dubbed the Newer Orthography. His recommended new writing began to spread in the 1860s. Ahrens was a virulent religious figure in social life, and secular literature in Estonia remained alien to him. The main purpose of his linguistic activity was to study and improve Ahrens's Estonian liturgical language.  Eduard Ahrens and Elias L√∂nnrot  In 1844, Elias L√∂nnrot, a well-known Finnish language speaker, who was the author of \\"Kalevala\\", met with Ahrens in Kuusalu. This visit is marked by a wall plate placed on the front door of the Kuusalu pastorate. The folk tradition of how \\"the great Finnish gentleman and the pastor of Kuusalu\\" are listening to the song of the villagers of Muuksi village is preserved.Ahrensi elu Laurentsiuse Seltsi veebisaidil (vaadatud 11.08.2017)  Legacy  * During the Soviet occupation of Estonia, the church traditions had broken apart and the epitaph on Ahrens' tomb were replaced only by his contributions to Estonian linguistics, instead of the examples of Latin and German that implied his religious activities. This attitude acquired special significance, since at the end of the 1970s the authorities attempted to introduce the concept of bilingualism and set Russian as the first priority instead of the Estonian language. This ironic parallelism between two mindsets is reflected in the Kalle Kurg poem \\"Leid\\".Kalle Kurg. M√§lestusm√§rk Eduard Ahrensile ‚Äì kultuur.err.ee 11.juuli 2017 * The Laurentius Society, operating in Kuusamo, decided to set up a memorial to Ahrens. Aivar Simson and Paul M√§nn's bronze statue won the design contest in 2011. Then the Laurentius Society started to launch a pan-Estonian fund collection to capture the memory of the innovator of the orthography of the Estonian language.K√ºsib Aili K√ºnstler Sirp, 13. juuni 2013 (vaadatud 11.08.2017) On August 10, 2013, the granite monument for Ahrens was opened with the money collected.

St Patrick's Rock or St Patrick's Stone is located in the River Clyde (NS461724) close to the Erskine Bridge and the old Erskine Ferry on the Renfrewshire side of the river. It is reputedly the location from which the 16 year old Saint Patrick was kidnapped by Irish pirates whilst he was fishing. The rock is covered at high tide and it is also the location of a navigation light known as St Patrick's Light. History Saint Patrick was born in Roman Britain in a place as yet unidentified with certainty. His father, Calpurnius, was a decurion. At the age of 16, Saint Patrick was kidnapped by Irish pirates whilst he was fishing and taken to Ireland where he remained as a captive for six years. He eventually returned to Ireland where he had a major role in converting the Irish to Christianity. The legend is said to have arisen or was first recorded in the 19th century. The Old Kilpatrick area began to be associated with St Patrick in the 10th century. His home was at a place known as 'Bannavem Taberniae' which the etymologists John Irving identifies with the local place name of Bonnaughton.  Description  St Patrick's Light at high tide with St Patrick's Rock submerged. This small rock is exposed towards low tide and is partly covered by the navigation aid known as St Patrick's Light. Running down to the rock from the Renfrewshire shore is the remnants of the old North Jetty. It at present lies on the edge of the deeper waters of the River Clyde at this point that remain inundated even at low tide. St Patrick's Light St Patrick‚Äôs Light (NS 46109 72428) is of 20th century, post WWII origin and stands atop a large cast iron gas cylinder which once fuelled the light until solar panels were added as an alternative power source. The North Jetty This ruinous jetty is around 60m in length and ends at St Patrick's Rock. It was constructed with a rubble core and once entirely surfaced by facing blocks. A narrow culvert once ran along the median line. The jetty once extended a further 20m and also had another navigation beacon at its terminus. The second beacon and jetty extension no longer exist. The jetty was one of a pair with the remnants of the other lying on the northern side of the Erskine Bridge. Micro-history Saint Patrick's church at Old Kilpatrick is said to have been built on a bed of Irish soil and the near by St Patrick's Well or the Trees Well provided water to the people of the town for many years, howeverh it is now covered over.

Initially named the Guntersville Gleam, the paper was named for the gleam sunlight made on the town's Guntersville lake. The paper disregarded most traditions of the time regarding small-town papers. It ran few editorials, almost exclusively ran local news, did not departmentalize its stories, and adopted a casual, occasionally humorous style. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s the paper was best known for its unique approach to obituaries, which combined personal details of the deceased's life with often anecdotes and style more common in the obituaries of famous people. The practice occasioned a study of the obituaries in a full chapter of Kitch and Hume's Journalism in a Culture of Grief, where the authors analyzed 738 obituaries printed by the paper to better understand the role obituaries can play in local news. The local focus and unique style worked: at the time of Porter Harvey's death in 1995 the paper had the largest circulation of any non-daily in the state. After Porter's death his son Sam‚Äîwho had worked alongside his father at the paper for many years as an editor‚Äîcarried forward the traditions of the paper.

It is situated within the Alpine Lakes Wilderness, on land managed by Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest. The mountain's name \\"Chikamin\\" derives from Chinook Jargon meaning \\"money\\" or \\"metal\\", and was submitted by Edmond S. Meany, president of The Mountaineers.http://www.washington.edu/uwired/outreach/cspn/Website/Classroom%20Materials/Curriculum%20Packets/Treaties%20&%20Reservations/Documents/Chinook_Dictionary_Abridged.pdf This name was officially adopted in 1916 by the U.S. Board on Geographic Names. Chikamin Peak is the highest point of Chikamin Ridge, northeast of Snoqualmie Pass. Other notable peaks on Chikamin Ridge include Four Brothers and Three Queens. Precipitation runoff from this mountain drains into tributaries of the Yakima River. The Pacific Crest Trail traverses the southwest slope of Chikamin Ridge, and from the trail a scramble up a gully leads to the summit. Climate Chikamin Peak is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades (Orographic lift). As a result, the west side of the Cascades experiences high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer. Because of maritime influence, snow tends to be wet and heavy, resulting in high avalanche danger. Geology The Alpine Lakes Wilderness features some of the most rugged topography in the Cascade Range with craggy peaks and ridges, deep glacial valleys, and granite walls spotted with over 700 mountain lakes. Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to the various climate differences. These climate differences lead to vegetation variety defining the ecoregions in this area. The elevation range of this area is between about in the lower elevations to over on Mount Stuart. Pacific Crest Trail and gullies on Chikamin Peak The history of the formation of the Cascade Mountains dates back millions of years ago to the late Eocene Epoch. With the North American Plate overriding the Pacific Plate, episodes of volcanic igneous activity persisted. In addition, small fragments of the oceanic and continental lithosphere called terranes created the North Cascades about 50 million years ago. During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured the landscape leaving deposits of rock debris. The last glacial retreat in the Alpine Lakes area began about 14,000 years ago and was north of the Canada‚ÄìUS border by 10,000 years ago. The \\"U\\"-shaped cross section of the river valleys are a result of that recent glaciation. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the Alpine Lakes Wilderness area.

In 1993 it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. History Frederick Schumann was born in Saxony, Germany in 1832. When he was 18, his parents Christian and Susanna Schlag Schumann sold their farm in Schoenburg and sailed to America with their eight children. They stayed a bit with Susanna's relatives at Springfield Corners, then bought 80 acres in a picturesque valley that fronted on the road from Madison to Sauk City, with Indian Lake behind. When the Schumanns arrived in 1850, there were only 24 voters in the township, and part of the Schumanns' new farm was stumps left from logging. with In 1854 son Frederick bought 80 acres to the east of his parents' farm, the land which this article describes. He married Susanna Zimmerman the following year. They had children. After serving in the Civil War, Schumann continued farming, and had expanded his farm to 140 acres by 1873. Frederick must have been well-respected because his neighbors elected him president of the newly formed Berry Mutual Fire Insurance Company in 1876, and a member of the board of directors. By 1877 Frederick and Susanna had eleven children, and they decided to build a new house to replace the one they had been living in. Frederick was \\"gifted in woodworking and carpentry\\" and is said to have built a lot of the house. The house has a saltbox shape, meaning the front is two stories tall while the rear roof reaches down to a one-story wall - a form more common in early New England than Wisconsin. The walls are of limestone rubble 18 inches thick, with mortar tooled over the surface to suggest coursed blocks. The front door has a stone sill and a lintel in which is carved \\"F. S. 1878\\" in characters that look from that period. The top of the wall is framed in a fascia board. The roof is clad in thin cedar shakes, similar to the originals. Inside, the front door opens into a living room in which the three windows are trimmed in wood down to the floor, so that each is like a built-in bookshelf. Most floors are of unpainted pine boards. The back rooms are a dining room and kitchen. Upstairs are bedrooms. The area under the rear slope of the roof was used as an unfinished sleeping area for some of the Schumann's fifteen children. Susanna died in 1892. In 1894 Frederick sold the farm to his son Gustave and moved to Mazomanie. In 1901 the neighbor Michael Kelter bought the farm. By 1905 a frame summer kitchen was added off the dining room, with a shed-roofed open porch next to it. Kelter operated a dairy farm, with a rough circle of farm buildings to the south of the house: a gas house, an animal barn, a wood silo, a granary, a machine shed, a corn crib, a hog barn, and a chicken coop. In 1965 John Street, a linguistics professor at UW-Madison, bought the farm and began to restore the house. He replastered the inside walls and replaced the old summer kitchen with a somewhat similar one- story frame addition behind the house. Dr. Street's obituary in 2017 reveals his affection for the place: > There was one non-academic accomplishment of which Professor Street was > especially proud: the restoration of an 1878 stone salt-box house in Berry > Township, northwest of Madison. Thanks to sheer luck he was able to purchase > the fine old house - with considerable acreage and part of a small lake - > for a very reasonable price in 1965. After much physical labor, and > professional replacement of wiring, plumbing, etc., he moved into the house > in 1966, and lived there (with his wife, after marriage in 1975) for over 30 > years.

The Bondi Sewer Vent is a heritage-listed sewer vent shaft located at Military Road, North Bondi, Waverley Municipality, New South Wales, Australia. It was designed by the Metropolitan Board of Water Supply and Sewerage. It is also known as Sewer Vent (Ben Buckler), Ben Buckler and Earlier brick vent. The property is owned by Sydney Water, an agency of the Government of New South Wales. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 15 November 2002.  History  Consistent with the then Metropolitan Board of Water Supply and Sewerage (MBWS&S;) aim to provide ventilation to the sewers to prevent the air inside from becoming \\"dense\\", a brick ventilation shaft was constructed at Bondi (Ben Buckler) in 1888 over the outfall sewer. The dimensions of that vent shaft were and in height. Similar brick shafts were also built at Bellevue Hill (1889) in height and York Street, Glebe (1895), in height. The first brick vent shaft soon developed a series of cracks and flaws. In response to the deterioration of the brick shaft, the Engineer-in-Chief, John Smail submitted to the Board a design for a new Ventilation Shaft and outlet. Tenders were called for the contract,Contract No. 894 with an estimated cost of A‚Ç§2,000. As the lowest tender received was 17% above the budgeted estimate, the then Board accepted his recommendation for the shaft to be erected by selected day labour under the supervision of Board's staff. In 1910, the brick shaft was demolished and replaced with the reinforced concrete vent shaft that is still present today. This reinforced concrete shaft was described as being: The Ben Buckler Vent Stack has a long history of maintenance works due to the corrosion of the reinforced concrete from hydrogen sulphide (H2S) gas and cracking and spalling concrete. This includes: *1938Removal of reinforced concrete and reinforcement on the inside of the shaft to a depth of due to corrosion from H2S gas attack and its replacement with clinker bricks *1948Works to repair the deterioration of brick joints by H2S gas with an experimental patch of joints repaired with ordinary mortar and painted with six coats of silicate of soda *1956Repointing of affected areas up to a height of *1963-65Addition of steel reinforcing bands around the outside of the stack and repointing of the brick joints in the shaft with cement mortar *1977-78Replacement/repair of the external steel work including lightning protection, ladders and steel bands. Repair of cracks and the addition of new lining. These repairs were expected to maintain the Vent Stack for about another ten years *2000-01Patch repairs to the external surface to make good spalled and drummy areas. Repair of cracks and the application of a crack accommodating elastomeric protective coating. Installation of new steel compression bands to provide stability against vertical cracks  Description  The vent shaft is presently sited as a prominent element surrounded by open landscape adjacent the escarpment and as part of what is now Bondi Golf Course. It is prominent as a vista along New South Head Road at the corner of Penkevil Street. It is the dominant element at the end of the Vista from Curlewis Street and Old South Head Road. The shaft comprises a classically designed pedestal, base, shaft and part capital of reinforced concrete. The pedestal is rusticated and splayed up to a base which is part fluted where it meets the shaft and smooth rendered up to the remaining section of capital. Numerous repair works including substantial steel bands have been fitted to all parts of the shaft and in more recent times decorative lights, lightning conductors and numerous appendages have been fitted. Immediately to the south of the base is a series of concrete access lids to the chamber below with three steel vents and cowls probably dating from the mid to late 20th century. A painted brick access structure is located to the south east of the shaft, which has a flat concrete lid and would date from the mid to late 20th century. A chain wire mesh fence surrounds the base of the vent shaft which dates from the late 20th century. The inscription on the southern face of the pedestal reads \\"Metropolitan Board of Water Supply and Sewerage erected 1910\\". In terms of integrity the vent shaft and pedestal would be reasonably intact although it has a number of later appendages and missing its original capital. Internally the shaft has been relined and repaired more than once due to spalling of concrete and corrosion of reinforcement bars. It appears the capital has been rendered smooth. Immediate physical curtilage would be around the base in the area of the existing fence extending to include the concrete access hatches, vents and access bulk head, but acknowledging the vents and bulk head are not in themselves significant. The visual curtilage extends from the western topographical ridge top to the ocean on the north and south of the vent shaft. Reasonably intact.  Modifications and dates  1938, 1948, 1956, 1963, 1977, 2001.  Heritage listing  As at 4 February 2002, this classically designed vent shaft, albeit not the first on the site, is aesthetically the most significant reinforced concrete structure of its type in the Sydney Water system. It is an important landmark for a great distance and likely to be held in high regard by the community. It is likely to be unique in NSW for its use, design and construction. The Bondi Sewer Vent was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 15 November 2002 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. It is one of the few major visible parts of the 19th century engineering work, the BOOS, being the first major sewerage system in Sydney. It is the first Vent Stack constructed in reinforced concrete by the then Metropolitan Board of Water Supply & Sewerage. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. The Vent Stack is a prominent landmark feature of the coastline near Bondi. Its placement in an open setting is important to the maintenance of these landmark qualities. The architectural design reflects the quality and taste of the day with an understanding of classical proportions and principles. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The Vent Stack is also likely to have social significance in its landmark qualities to the local community, and for the function it serves. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The vent stack demonstrates the early advances in the use of reinforced concrete, particularly in regard to sewer and structural engineering. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The shaft is unique in Sydney Water's system and likely NSW. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. The ventilation function is now common place and representative of sewage systems.

Education and personal life Wilfrid Ash was born in Sculcoates, East Riding of Yorkshire, England to engineer father, William Ash, and mother Phoebe (n√©e Cracroft). His general education was at Ipswich Endowed School and, having studied privately with Bertram Lawrence Hurst between 1903 and 1907, he gained a B.Sc (Engineering) in 1909 from London University. The same year, he married Beatrice Millicent Baxter UK Government: General Register Office (GRO) index: Marriages Dec 1909 Portsmouth Vol. 2b Pg. 902 and they had two children together, Marjory Yvonne (b. 1915 in Calcutta, India) and Maurice Anthony Ash, the environmentalist, writer and planner, in Hazaribagh, India. Beatrice died in 1917 during childbirth. In 1926 Wilfrid remarried, Edith Maud Harper, in Calcutta. They had one son, Michael Edward Ash (b.1927), the mathematician and brewer who invented ‚ÄòEasy Serve‚Äô Draught Guinness and who pioneered the nitro-beer category.

Career In his early years, Wilfrid Ash was engaged in the construction of the gun- batteries at Portsmouth Harbour. In 1907 he joined the Indian Civil Service and in 1909 became a Member of the Institution of Civil Engineers. He was posted to Calcutta in 1910 where he was responsible for the completion of King George's Dock. In 1928, he relocated to Vizagapatam, as engineer-in-chief, to design and supervise the construction of the new Vizagapatam Harbour (now called Visakhapatnam Port). Here he implemented the unique feature of scuttling, end-to-end, two tramp ships (each of about 400 feet in length and of about 3,000 tons) to form a revetment, enabling the containment of silting from the harbour area. The docks were completed in 1933.Obituary of Wilfrid Cracroft Ash Bovis Group News Release (11 December 1968) Two years later, Sir Clement Hindley said: WC Ash's revetment design at Vizagapatam Harbour Journal of the Institution of Civil Engineers Vol.1 Issue.2 Page 247 Ash retired from the Indian Civil Service in 1938 and, following the outbreak of WWII in 1939, he became a consultant to Sir Alexander Gibb & Partners, later joining the Ministry of Supply. He became engineer-in-chief for Bovis of the world‚Äôs largest ordnance factory, ROF Swynnerton, overseeing the erection of 1,700 buildings within just nine months. At the height of the war, the Swynnerton factory employed approximately 18,000 labourers and, as an arsenal, was instrumental in securing victory over the Nazis in 1945. In 1964, the MP for Newcastle-under-Lyme, Stephen Swingler commented: Ash also acted as consultant for the flotation of the Mulberry Harbour Phoenix Units used in the Normandy Landings. In 1946 he joined Paul Gilbert and with him founded the construction firm Gilbert-Ash Ltd (Initially Bovis (Public Works) Ltd; name changed to Gilbert-Ash Ltd 9 February 1946 before becoming Bovis Engineering Ltd on 20 February 1990), with which he remained until retiring in 1961 at the age of 77. Ash was a pioneer of industrial building, realising the advantages of using pre-stressed, precast concrete components to speed building operations and devoting much of his time, with the Ministry of Education, to the development of the Intergrid construction system for educational buildings.

In 2002 the district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. with The neighborhood was platted between 1922 and 1926 on a hill called Mendota Heights facing Lake Mendota, and is accessed by streets that curve to follow the contours of the hill. The district is large, with 247 contributing properties. Here are examples of a few styles, in the order built: * The McKenna house at 3401 Lake Mendota Dr. is an Arts and Crafts- style house built in 1924, two stories, with a low-pitched roof and wide eaves rolled at the edges to suggest the thatched roof of an English cottage. It was designed by Grant M. Hyde, a journalism professor at UW-Madison who had majored in architecture. McKenna was the real estate developer who founded Shorewood Hills. * The Fagan house at 3424 Viburnum Drive is also Arts and Crafts, also simply decorated and with multi-pane windows, but it has steeper rooflines more like Tudor Revival. It was designed by Balch and Lippert and built in 1926. * The Geisler house at 1518 Sumac Drive is a Tudor Revival house designed by Edward Tough and built in 1926, with a characteristic stone and stucco exterior and half-timbering. * The Gifford house at 3441 Crestwood Dr. is a French Normandy Revival-styled house designed by Law, Law & Potter and built in 1926, with characteristic hipped roof, wall dormers, and multi- pane casement windows. * The Horner house at 3515 Blackhawk Drive is a large Mediterranean Revival home designed by Law, Law & Potter and built in 1926, with characteristic tile roof and round-arched doors and windows. * The Davis house at 1124 Oak Way, pictured above, is a Georgian Revival-styled house designed by Doris Baldwin Mohs and built in 1927. It has a symmetric facade and a Palladian window above the front door - both characteristic of this style. Llittig house, Tudor Revival, 1931 * The Llittig house at 1303 Edgehill Drive is another Tudor Revival house, built in 1931, with an exterior of brick, stone and half-timbered stucco. * The Oldenburg house at 1130 Shorewood Blvd is a Contemporary-styled house designed by Balch & Lippert and built in 1936. With a small upright second story suggesting a pilot house, it was called \\"Steamboat around the Bend.\\" * The Hall house at 1506 Wood Lane is a Colonial Revival-styled house built in 1937 - one of many with symmetric facades. * The Rowell house at 3405 Blackhawk Dr. is a Colonial Revival-styled house built in 1937 with an asymmetrical facade, and with some of its outside walls clad in stone. * The Kaeser house at 3505 Blackhawk Drive is a Prairie School house designed by the owner's brother William V. Kaeser and built in 1937. Typical of this style, it has horizontal emphasis, a low-pitched roof, and touches that feel a bit Oriental. * The Hartshorne house at 3218 Topping Rd. is an International-style house designed by Beatty & Strang and built in 1941, typically boxy and simple. * The Bloomfield house at 1010 Edgehill Drive is a Contemporary-styled home built in 1963 which curves above its hillside driveway.

Chapin Hall is funded through social service systems, foundations, and non- profit organizations. The organization's focus areas include child welfare and foster care systems, youth homelessness, and community capacity to support children, youth, and families (including early childhood initiatives, home visitation and maltreatment prevention, juvenile justice, and school systems). Chapin Hall is an affiliated research center of the University of Chicago.  History  Chapin Hall at the University of Chicago was founded in 1860 as the Chicago Nursery and Half-Orphan Asylum. In addition to housing orphans and other dependent children, the Asylum provided day care services for working mothers. In 1931, the Chicago Nursery and Half-Orphan Asylum moved into a building at 2800 West Foster Avenue. After the move, the organization became known by the name of that building, Chapin Hall Center for Children. By the 1960s and 70s, Chapin Hall Center for Children was financially dependent on state money. During the 70s and 80s, national public policy shifted to fund institutional care for only \\"severely disturbed children.\\" As a result of dwindling support, in 1984, Chapin Hall Center for Children decided to close its residential care program. The following year, Chapin Hall Center for Children was re-opened as a policy research center affiliated with the University of Chicago. The goal of the newly formed organization was to conduct research about child welfare and well-being, in alignment with its history as a residential care facility. Harold A. Richman was the first executive director of the research center and held that role through 2008.  Research and policy initiatives  Chapin Hall's three major areas of focus are child welfare, community capacity building, and youth homelessness. [9] Chapin Hall houses a number of ongoing initiatives related to child, youth, and family well-being.  Center for State Child Welfare Data  The Center for State Child Welfare Data is a platform that enables public sector agencies to store and analyze administrative data related to children placed in out-of- home care. , 22 states used the platform, covering about 70% of children in the U.S. in the child welfare system. One component of Center is the Foster Care Data Archive. The archive provides access to information about children in the foster care system over time. In addition to providing a platform for the data, Chapin Hall staff help members analyze data for both policymaking and in practice.Center for Substance Abuse Treatment. Introduction to Cross- System Data Sources in Child Welfare, Alcohol and Other Drug Services, and Courts. HHS Publication No. (SMA) 11-4630. Rockville, MD: Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, 2011. pp 14-15.  Doris Duke Fellowship for the Promotion of Child Well-Being  Chapin Hall receives financial support from the Doris Duke Charitable Foundation to run a fellowship program for current and recent graduate students interested in child well-being and maltreatment prevention. Researchers in the program are from multiple disciplines including social work, child development, public health, medicine, public policy, education, economics, psychology, and epidemiology. Fellows receive thirty thousand dollars to complete their dissertation and related research.  Transformational Collaborative Outcomes Management  Transformational Collaborative Outcomes Management (TCOM) is a framework for decision-making in complex systems. TCOM provides tools and guidance on an individual, program, and system level to help support decisions, monitor outcomes, and improve quality in child welfare systems. TCOM is the foundation of Child and Adolescent Needs and Strengths (CANS), an assessment strategy for monitoring the well-being of children and youth. CANS is broadly used in child welfare. As of 2018, the CANS was being used by nearly 5,000 agencies across 10 countries, including all 50 U.S. states. The assessment is used in the fields of child welfare, mental health, juvenile justice, autism and developmental health, and early intervention. The CANS-MH is a variant of the CANS for children and adolescents with mental health challenges. The tool has been shown to be a \\"reliable measure of psychosocial needs and strengths\\".  Oak Park Collaboration for Early Childhood  The Collaboration for Early Childhood is a nonprofit organization in Oak Park, Illinois that works to connect parents of young children to local resources. Their website also houses resource directories for health care professionals, educators, and service providers. Starting in 2013, the Collaboration for Early Childhood entered a five-year contract with Chapin Hall to build a comprehensive early childhood database. The database will unify administrative data sources, providing users with a view of school enrollment and poverty at a local level in Oak Park. Information on subsidized child care and SNAP benefits will be available at a state level. Once the database is live, providers will be able to access and analyze these data to help inform program and practice decision-making.  Voices of Youth Count Initiative  Voices of Youth Count is a research initiative on youth experiences of unaccompanied homelessness in the U.S. Chapin Hall partnered with twenty-two counties across the U.S. to conduct \\"youth-led counts and surveys of young people and providers\\". The research also included qualitative interviews in five of those twenty-two counties, a national phone survey, a survey of service providers, a review of policy related to youth homelessness, and a systematic review of published evidence on the effectiveness of programs targeting youth homelessness. Based on these data sources, Voices of Youth Count has produced a series of policy briefs. The first provided an estimate of the scale and character of youth homelessness in the U.S. The second report focused on lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans, and queer youth, and the third looked at youth homelessness among pregnant or parenting young people. Reports on youth counts, youth homelessness in the rural U.S., youth trajectories into and through homelessness, child welfare, and education are forthcoming.  Organization  Chapin Hall employs research and policy staff with experience in child welfare, epidemiology, psychology, social work, statistics, and youth development. The organization began with 15 employees in 1986, and has had more than one hundred employees as of 2013. Annual revenue in 1986 was about five hundred thousand. In 2016, that number stood at over five million dollars. Bryan Samuels is the current Executive Director of Chapin Hall. He joined the organization in 2013 after serving as the commissioner of the Administration on Children, Youth and Families in Washington D.C. In 2018, Samuels was the recipient of the Bernice Weissbourd Award for Family Support, awarded by Family Focus.

Plot Opening In a flashforward, \\"Gene\\" collapses at the Omaha Cinnabon and is raced to the hospital, but is discharged after doctors confirm he did not suffer a heart attack. As Gene leaves, the receptionist stops him to enter billing information, but neither his driver's license nor his Social Security number are recognized by the hospital database. Gene is apprehensive, but the receptionist quickly realizes she had made a mistake typing them in and allows him to leave. Gene takes a taxi back to the mall to get his car, but becomes uneasy when he recognizes the driver is making eye contact and he sees an Albuquerque Isotopes air freshener on the rear view mirror. He asks to be let out before reaching the mall and walks quickly around the corner and out of the driver's sight. Main story Howard calls Jimmy and Kim about the fire at Chuck's, and they arrive as Chuck's body is taken away. Jimmy sees the appliances outside Chuck's home and realizes his electromagnetic hypersensitivity symptoms returned. He falls into a deep depression which Kim tries to help him out of. Howard takes on the responsibility of arranging Chuck's funeral. Mike receives his first payment from Madrigal Electromotive as a contracted security consultant, which Gus arranged to launder the money Mike stole from the Salamancas. Though meant to be a paper transaction, Mike enters a Madrigal facility, performs a detailed security audit, and turns the results over to the facility manager with instructions to let Lydia know he was there. An ambulance comes to take Hector to the hospital after he suffers a stroke at a meeting with Juan Bolsa, Gus and Nacho. Following Mike's advice, Nacho takes the fake capsules containing ibuprofen from Hector and replaces them with Hector's real nitroglycerin. He tries to dispose of the fakes but is interrupted by Gus, who says they need to meet with Juan Bolsa immediately. Bolsa puts Nacho and Arturo in charge of the Salamanca operation for the time being. Afterwards, Nacho drives to a bridge and throws the ibuprofen away, unaware Victor has followed him. Several of Chuck's friends and associates attend his funeral and give Jimmy their condolences. After the service, Howard tells Jimmy and Kim he believes Chuck relapsed because Howard forced him out of HHM, so he feels responsible for Chuck's death. Kim is shocked as Jimmy lets Howard shoulder the blame and immediately regains his happy-go-lucky demeanor. Production In the opening scene, Saul is at his workplace, a Cinnabon mall store.

Plot Nacho aids Victor and Tyrus in making it appear that Nacho's car was attacked and the drugs he and Arturo picked up at Los Pollos Hermanos stolen, including riddling the car and Arturo's body with bullets and shooting Nacho twice. Nacho calls the Cousins, who burn the car and take Nacho to veterinarian Dr. Caldera, who succeeds in saving Nacho's life. Juan Bolsa tells Gus that because drug and cash shipments have been disrupted several times, Gus should begin investigating the feasibility of making meth within the United States rather than relying on cocaine from Mexico, unaware this is what Gus intended. Gus visits Gale Boetticher, a post-graduate student and researcher at the University of New Mexico, who reports on the poor quality of a meth sample Gus asked him to evaluate. Gale says he could produce a higher quality product, but Gus assures him he is destined for better things. Jimmy asks Mike to steal a valuable Hummel figurine from Neff Copiers and replace it with an inexpensive one that looks similar. Mike refuses, so Jimmy turns to Ira for help. Ira agrees, but during the theft, he finds one of the owners is sleeping in the office. He calls Jimmy for help and Jimmy creates a distraction that enables Ira to leave with the Hummel. Kim returns to work on the Mesa Verde account. Bank president Kevin Wachtell welcomes her back and shows her plans for the bank's aggressive expansion. Concerned about the rate of growth, and increasingly bored with banking law, Kim gives the work to her paralegal Viola, and asks to be dropped off at the courthouse. That evening, Kim gives Jimmy Chuck's letter. Kim offers to leave so he can read it alone but Jimmy insists she stay. The letter is undated but appears to have been written when Jimmy worked in HHM's mailroom. On the surface the letter is full of praise, but it is slightly condescending and contains backhanded compliments. Jimmy calls it \\"nice\\", but Kim begins crying and runs off to their bedroom. Production \\"Something Beautiful\\" is the first Better Call Saul episode for Breaking Bad character Gale Boetticher, portrayed by David Costabile (pictured). This episode includes the first appearance of Gale Boetticher, a major character from Breaking Bad's third season played by David Costabile, into Better Call Saul. Costabile had been in Albuquerque filming Dig while Better Call Sauls team was wrapping up production of the final episode of the first season. He ran into co-producer Peter Gould and had a meal with him, during which they agreed that it would be great to have Gale appear on Better Call Saul. Costabile had not thought about it until he was contacted by the show's team, asking if he was ready to come back as Gale. Costabile was able to work in filming for Better Call Saul between filming on Billions. Costabile had only about a week with the script to memorize both his lines and to be able to sing karaoke to Tom Lehrer's \\"The Elements\\", in contrast to his past singing performances on Breaking Bad where he had more time to learn the lyrics.

Plot Opening In a flashback, a younger Mike pours the concrete for a car port and allows his son to write his name, \\"Matty,\\" in the wet concrete. Mike is revealed to be discussing his son at a group therapy session with Stacey, and ends his time by saying \\"You wanted me to talk.

The store sees little traffic, and Jimmy soon becomes bored. Ira meets with Jimmy to hand over his share of the stolen Hummel figurine and offers to steal others in the future. Kim avoids Mesa Verde work by spending the day in Judge Munsinger's courtroom. He calls her to his office during a recess, warning her that if he sees her again in his courtroom, he will assign her pro bono work. When Munsinger returns to the bench, he spots Kim again waiting in the audience. As part of covering up the fake attack on Nacho and Arturo, Victor sells the Salamancas' portion of the drugs to the Espinosas, their rivals. After Nacho tips them off, the Cousins raid the Espinosas' headquarters, killing most of the gang and recovering the drugs. After returning the drugs, they retreat back to Mexico to avoid police scrutiny. Nacho recognizes that Gus had planned for this, as Gus is now able to expand into the Espinosas' territory without resistance. Nacho convinces his reluctant father to let him stay with him while he recovers from his wounds. During lunch with Anita, Mike explains that Henry, another member of their support group, has been lying about his past, falsely claiming to have a wife who died. At the next meeting Mike is put in a bad mood when Stacey says she was able to get through most of a day without thinking of Matt, so he angrily confronts Henry about his lies. Having been exposed, Henry wordlessly leaves the room. Mike then condemns Anita, Stacey and the other participants for being so self-absorbed they are unable to see through Henry's obvious falsehoods.

Plot Opening In a flashforward, Saul Goodman and Francesca frantically clear out his office. She agrees to be at a telephone booth on November 12 (Jimmy's birthday) at 3 p.m. to receive a call. He gives her money and an attorney's business card and tells her that if she needs help she should say \\"Jimmy\\" sent her. As she leaves, Saul claims the last few years have been \\"quite a ride\\". Saul then calls his \\"disappearer\\" for a new identity. Main story In 2003, Jimmy sells pay-as-you-go phones to a customer who saw his \\"privacy sold here\\" sign. He then starts selling prepaid phones on the street, but the venture proves unsuccessful when he is mugged by three teenagers. Kim tends his wounds while Jimmy is concerned that he did not realize the teenagers' intent because he was not thinking clearly. He promises to call the psychiatrist Kim recommended, but instead returns to CC Mobile and spends the day removing the storefront sign. Mike escorts engineers through the laundry to evaluate it as a site for Gus's planned meth \\"superlab\\". One glibly asserts he can easily do the job, but is turned away by Gus, who listens in from a nearby room. Another, Werner Ziegler, impresses Gus by forthrightly expressing his concerns about the risk. Gus offers him the job of planning and overseeing the lab's construction. Kim thrives in the environment of her pro bono criminal defense work. While waiting for a client to dress before going to court, Paige calls from Mesa Verde and insists they need her help immediately to fix recently filed paperwork. Kim hangs up on Paige and sees her criminal case through, then goes to Mesa Verde. Paige informs her that the bank's legal staff had to drop everything else to fix the problem, and reminds her that when she became Mesa Verde's outside counsel, she promised that the bank would be her sole focus. Kim apologizes and promises it will not happen again. Jimmy meets Howard in the courthouse restroom and sees that he is looking sleepless, but Howard does not divulge why. Jimmy offers Howard the phone number of the psychiatrist Kim recommended. Howard claims he is going to therapy, so Jimmy throws the number away. Jimmy meets with his probation officer and states his intent to resume practicing law once the one- year suspension of his law license is over. Production This is the first episode of Better Call Saul to include scenes that take place during the Breaking Bad series narrative, using the set for Saul Goodman's law offices. Among the possessions that Saul extracts from the wall are passports and a shoebox of video tapes of the Saul Goodman television commercials, which according to Bob Odenkirk, are the same tapes seen in the flash-forward to Saul's new identity \\"Gene\\" in the pilot episode. Portions of the episode were shot at the Dog House, a real drive-up diner in Albuquerque and previously used as Jesse Pinkman's hangout during Breaking Bad. The song \\"Street Life\\" by The Crusaders is played during the montage in which Jimmy sells mobile phones on the street. Like Breaking Bad and unlike the rest of Better Call Saul, the opening flashforward was shot on non-digital film camera. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCgDjHDzZRs (6:44) Reception \\"Quite a Ride\\" received critical acclaim. On Rotten Tomatoes, it had a 100% \\"certified fresh\\" rating with an average of 9.62 out of 10 from 15 reviews. The site's consensus reads, \\"Saul goes full Breaking Bad in an exciting, emotional episode that proves 'Quite a Ride'.‚Äù Ratings \\"Quite a Ride\\" was watched by 1.53 million viewers on its first broadcast, earning a 0.4 ratings for viewers between 18 and 49.

The farm lies in a big valley prone to erosion and was early to try out erosion control dams and planting crops in contour strips. In 1994 the farm was added to the State and the National Register of Historic Places. with In 1856 Thosten Thompson- Rue and his wife Guri Gaarden bought 240 acres on the south side of a large ridge which the early Military Road passed on. Thosten was born in Norway in 1819, and immigrated to America in 1839, following the Erie Canal and the Great Lakes to Wisconsin. He joined his mother and brother in Missouri, but after his mother went west with the Mormons, the two brothers returned to Wisconsin. His brother shortly headed west to and made a name as Snowshoe Thompson, delivering mail in the Sierra Nevadas, in winter using ski techniques he had learned in Norway. Meanwhile, with their farm on the major early road heading west through Dane County, the Thompsons hosted hundreds of Norwegian immigrants looking for new homes in a new land. By 1876 the Thomsons were transitioning from wheat-farming to dairy, and Thosten and his son Henry built a large dairy barn with a 34x100 foot footprint - the gable-roofed section of the barn that still stands today. The basement story has walls of stone built into the hillside, and has a typical dairy set-up, with stanchions for the cows. Above, a ramp gives drive-in access to the haymow for unloading. The gambrel-roofed section of the barn was added around 1915 and the milk house around 1940. Henry married Annie Skindrud. Thosten died in 1880, and his son Henry took over the farm. In 1909 Henry built an impressive new house - two stories, wood-framed, with a cross-gable roof. The styling was Queen Anne, with shingles covering the attic gables and ornate spindle-work decorating the gable peaks. Shallow bays protrude here and there. The front porch is supported by Doric columns and decorated with a classical frieze. The back porch is more typical Queen Anne: turned posts supporting spindlework across the top. Inside are oak floors, pocket doors, a built-in buffet, and brass light fixtures. In 1914, Henry Thompson moved to a different farm, selling the original farm to Jacob Stolen. In 1920, Martin Skindrud managed to buy it, bringing it back into the family. The whole farm lies in a valley with a gully down the middle. By the 1930s erosion must have become a concern because Jerome and Eric Skindrud asked the ASC office to help put in contour strips for their crops. The work was done by a Civilian Conservation Corps camp in Mt. Horeb. The CCCs also built two stone dams in the gully below the farm buildings, 10 feet across and 5 feet high, out of limestone that they quarried. This was probably in 1934. In 1994 the farm was listed on the NRHP for its largely intact farm buildings going back to 1876. It is also significant as perhaps the first farm in the area to adopt soil conservation measures.

Dawson (born August 5, 1961) is an American neuroscientist who is the director of the Programs in Neuroregeneration and Stem Cells at the Institute for Cell Engineering at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. She has joint appointments in the Department of Neurology, Neuroscience and Physiology. She is a member of the Graduate Program in Cellular and Molecular Medicine and Biochemistry, Cellular and Molecular Biology. Biography Dawson grew up in the Sonoma Valley Wine Country in California. Dawson received her B.S. in environmental toxicology in 1983 from the University of California, Davis. She earned her Ph.D. in pharmacology and toxicology from the University of Utah School of Medicine. Postdoctoral training was conducted at the University of Pennsylvania and the National Institute on Drug Abuse Addiction Research Center. Dawson joined the faculty at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine in 1994 as an assistant professor in the departments of Neurology, Neuroscience and Physiology. In 2001, she became an associate professor in the departments of Neurology, Neuroscience and Physiology and served as the vice chair of faculty development in the department of Neurology. Dawson was promoted to the position of professor in the departments of Neurology, Neuroscience and Physiology in 2001. In 2002, she founded the Neuroregeneration Program in the Institute of Cell Engineering and became director of the Stem Cell Program in 2009. She was named a Daniel Nathans Innovator in 2017. She served the Society for Neuroscience as a reviewing editor (2003‚Äì2009) and then as a senior editor (2010‚Äì2016) for the Journal of Neuroscience and is now serving as an advisory board editor for the other society journal, eNeuro. She also served the Society for Neuroscience on the Committee on Women in Neuroscience (2007‚Äì2010), professional development committee (2009‚Äì2011) and the program committee (2011‚Äì2014). She serves on the scientific advisory board of the New York Stem Cell Foundation, the Weill Cornell Burke Medical Research Institute the external advisory board for the Interdepartmental Neuroscience (NUIN) graduate training program at Northwestern University, and the advisory board for NeuroMab. She was a founder of AGY Therapeutics. She is a founder and is on the scientific advisory board of Neuraly and Valted, LLC.  Research  Dawson works closely with her husband and partner, Dr. Ted M. Dawson. Their research studies the molecular mechanisms that lead to neuronal cell death in neurodegenerative diseases, stroke and trauma. They discovered the critical role the gasous transmitter, nitric oxide (NO), plays in glutamate excitotoxicity and stroke with their postdoctoral mentor, Dr. Solomon H. Snyder. They defined the role for NO generated from neuronal NO synthase or immunologic NO synthase leads in models of HIV dementia and Parkinson‚Äôs disease. Exploring the signaling cascade led to the identification of peroxynitrite as the nitrogen oxide moiety that mediates neurotoxicity, and the role for poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) as the next step in the neurotoxic cascade. They discovered that poly (ADP-ribose) polymer (PAR) is a novel cell death signaling molecule that plays a critical role in neuronal injury. Her research team discovered that PAR leads to cell death by facilitating the release of apoptosis inducing factor (AIF) factor from the mitochondrial surface. Parsylated AIF then recruits macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) and the complex translocates to the nucleus where the nuclease activity of MIF leads to large scale DNA fragmentation. To distinguish this form of cell death from other cell death signaling cascades it was named Parthanatos, for PAR and the Greek god of death, Thanatos. The enzyme that degrades PAR, poly (ADP-ribose) glycohydrolase, is not only an endogenous negative regulator of parthanatos, but required for cell viability. In genetic screens to find cell signals that prevent neurotoxicity, her team discovered an endogenous inhibitor of parthanatos, Iduna (RNF146), a first in class PAR-dependent E3 ligase. In the same screens, Botch was discovered which is an important inhibitor of Notch signaling via deglycination of Notch preventing Notch‚Äôs intracellular processing at the level of the Golgi, playing an important role in neuronal development and survival. They also discovered Thorase, an AAA+ ATPase that regulates glutamate (AMPA) receptor trafficking and discovered that Thorase is an important regulator of synaptic plasticity, learning and memory. Genetic variants of Thorase were found in schizophrenic patients. Expression of these variants in mice lead to behavioral deficits that were normalized with the AMPA antagonist Parampenal. Mutations in Thorase leading to gain or loss of function result in lethal developmental disorders in children. With the discovery of gene mutations that are the cause of rare familial cases of Parkinson‚Äôs disease, their research team has probed the biologic and pathologic actions of these proteins. They discovered parkin was an E3 ligase that is inactive in patients with genetic mutations in parkin, and that it is also inactive in sporadic Parkinson‚Äôs disease due to protein modifications by S-nitrosylation and c-Abl tyrosine phosphorylation which led to the discovery of the pathogenic targets, PARIS and AIMP2. PARIS regulates the machinery critical to mitochondrial quality control and thus cell survival. Surprisingly, AIMP2 directly interacts with PARP and activates Parthanatos. Since there are PARP inhibitors in clinical use this finding may provide a new therapeutic target for the treatment of Parkinson‚Äôs disease. They discovered that DJ-1, which is dysfunctional in Parkinson‚Äôs disease, is an atypical peroxidoxin-like peroxidase and that its loss of function in PD leads to mitochondrial dysfunction. The Dawson‚Äôs discovered that mutations in LRRK2 increase its kinase activity and that inhibition of LRRK2 kinase activity is protective in models of Parkinson‚Äôs disease. The increase in LRRK2 kinase activity leads to enhanced protein translation via the phosphorylation of the ribosomal protein s15. Understanding this shift in the proteome due to altered translation will allow new insight into the alteration in expression of critical proteins that likely underlie the pathogenesis of Parkinson‚Äôs disease. ArfGAP regulates the GTPase activity of LRRK2 and they discovered that ArfGAP and LRRK2 reciprocally regulate the activity of each other determining neuronal viability. Their labs also discovered that pathologic Œ±-synuclein spreads in the nervous system via engagement with the lymphocyte- activation gene 3 (LAG3). They discovered that Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP1R) agonist, NLY01 prevents neuroinflammaory damage induced by pathologic Œ±-synuclein in Parkinson‚Äôs disease via inhibition of microglia and prevention of the conversion of resting astrocytes to activated A1 astrocytes. Their work continues to provide critical insights into understanding of the pathogenesis of PD and identify new opportunities for therapies to treat patients with Parkinson‚Äôs disease.

F. Klaveness & Co of Sandefjord. Her name means Northern Lights in Mi'kmaq language. The ship was primarily employed as an ore and coal carrier during her career. Design and Construction Wegadesk was laid down at Burmeister & Wain shipyard in Copenhagen and launched on 11 April 1908 (yard number 264), with Mrs. Asmundsen Skaal, wife of the shipyard president being the sponsor. After successful completion of sea trials Wegadesk was handed over to her owners on May 14. The ship was specially designed for ore and coal transportation between North America and Europe. As built, the ship was long (between perpendiculars) and abeam, a mean draft of . Wegadesk was assessed at , and 7,318 DWT. The vessel had a steel hull, and a single 413 nhp triple-expansion steam engine, with cylinders of , , and diameter with a stroke, that drove a single screw propeller, and moved the ship at up to . Operational history After delivery Wegadesk was immediately chartered to the Nova Scotia Steel & Coal Company, and left for Wabana via Tyne on May 17, 1908. Upon arrival, the ship loaded iron ore and left for Rotterdam on June 2 reaching it on June 12. The vessel continued serving Wabana to Rotterdam route for the rest of the 1908 summer navigational season. On September 28, 1908 Wegadesk on her way from Rotterdam had to call at Copenhagen due to leaking forepeak and had to be put into drydock for repairs. The ship returned to service on October 15. From November 1908 through mid-January 1909, the vessel was involved in iron ore carriage from Wabana to Philadelphia. On November 27, Wegadesk collided with British steamer Ashanti in North Sydney harbor, but suffered only minor damage and was able to proceed to Philadelphia a couple of days later. With the closure of navigational season, Wegadesk sailed to Jacksonville where she loaded 3,702 tons of phosphate rock on January 26, 1909. The ship then continued on to Savannah and loaded 1,558 bales of cotton and other cargo for various European ports on January 29 and left for Rotterdam the next day. The vessel continued serving the Wabana-Rotterdam route through early June. On May 13 Wegadesk arrived at St. John's from Rotterdam damaged by ice. On June 11 she again arrived at St. John's from Rotterdam damaged by ice and had to undergo repairs. Subsequently, Wegadesk spent the rest of 1909 hauling coal between Sydney and Montreal. Following the completion of 1909 navigational season, the ship was chartered to carry general cargo to Russia. The vessel departed from Baltimore on December 29 bound for Odessa and Novorossiysk carrying among other things 7,709 packages of agricultural machinery and 32,920 bales of twine. The vessel arrived in Odessa on January 23, 1910, and upon unloading sailed for Nikolaieff from Novorossiysk on February 12 to load wheat for Rotterdam. From Rotterdam Wegadesk continued on to Narvik where it loaded iron ore and departed for Philadelphia on April 2. Upon arrival, the ship made two trips between Wabana and Philadelphia before resuming her coal carrying duties between Sydney and Montreal in late May 1910 which lasted through the end of the year. Following the completion of 1910 navigational season, the ship was again chartered to carry general cargo to Russia. The vessel departed from Baltimore on January 11, 1911 bound for Odessa carrying among other things agricultural machinery, gasoline engines, and 17,709 bales of twine. From Odessa the ship continued again to load wheat in Nikolaieff and departed it on March 9, 1911 for Rotterdam. Subsequently, she returned to Canada in early May to resume her coal trade on the St. Lawrence river for the remainder of the year. On December 18, 1911 Wegadesk left Wabana with a cargo of iron ore for Middlesbrough. During the first five months of 1912, the ship was employed in iron ore trade between Norwegian ports of Kirkeness and Narvik and Middlesbrough. The ship returned to Canada in June 1912 and again resumed her coal trade between Sydney and Montreal until completion of the navigational season. Wegadesk then was chartered to transport iron ore between Wabana and Emden. During one of these trips, on December 7, 1912 the ship had to call in at Falmouth due to damage sustained during stormy weather. After completing all the necessary repairs, Wegadesk departed from South Shields on December 27 to return to North America. Upon return, Wegadesk was chartered to carry coal from Virginia ports of Norfolk and Newport News to Col√≥n and Cuba and transport iron ore on her return voyage from Felton in Cuba to Baltimore. The ship departed for her first trip on January 31, 1913 from Norfolk and continued operating this route through 1915. During one of these trips, on April 21, 1913, Wegadesk while leaving Curtis Bay with about 6,600 tons of coal, collided with a large schooner Edward B. Winslow being tugged in to take her place at the loading pier. Fortunately, both ships only suffered minor damage and could continue their journeys without much of a delay. Starting in 1916 Wegadesk was mainly involved in carrying goods, including wheat, from North America and coal from Great Britain to Italy. On May 25, 1915 it was reported that the owner of the vessel, A. F. Klaveness, has reassigned the ship to a newly formed holding company, D/S A/S \\"Wegadesk\\", with a capital of 174,000 NOK. At around 10:00 on August 12, 1916 Wegadesk, while on passage from Tyne to Genoa, collided with steamer Dunvegan Castle in the Downs of the river Thames, striking her bow on the starboard side. Both vessels suffered damage, mostly bent plates in the bow area, and had to proceed to port for quick repairs. Sinking Wegadesk departed Baltimore for her final journey on February 22, 1918 with a cargo of general goods and some metals destined for a variety of customers in Genoa. Following the protocol established by the British authorities, the ship had to call first at Gibraltar for inspection. The ship was under command of Captain Hans Hansen and had a crew of 30 men. The journey was uneventful until the morning of March 10, when a lookout on the vessel spotted a ship with a long foremast around 10:30 in an approximate position . The ship turned out to be a German submarine. The U-boat approached Wegadesk to within a half a mile and fired several shots ordering her to stop. The crew complied, stopped the engines and lowered the lifeboats and abandoned the vessel and started rowing away. The submarine followed the crew, and ordered Captain Hansen to bring the ship papers on board the U-boat, and after their examination, a 14-man prize crew went aboard Wegadesk. The ship's crew was ordered back on board to help to transfer about 50 tons of copper and brass onto the German submarine. Besides that, food supplies, navigational instruments, tools and a few other things were taken from the ship. The transfer took several days and was finished in the afternoon of March 13. The prize crew then planted several scuttling charges on board Wegadesk and fired them. An explosion was heard a few minutes later and the freighter quickly sank. Due to deteriorating weather conditions, the submarine quickly departed the area, and the ship's crew was left on their own. After two days of rowing, they safely reached the Moroccan coast around a town of Saphi on March 15. It was later discovered that the German submarine was responsible for the ship's sinking.

She was also Visiting Research Scholar and Visiting Professor in the Law and Public Affairs Program at Princeton University in 2006‚Äì2007. In 2008, Dickinson testified before the United States Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs on the subject of \\"private security firms operating in war zones\\" where she noted that \\"The use of private security contractors and interrogators poses special risks and potentially threatens core values embodied in our legal system including respect for human dignity and limits on the use of force as well as a commitment to transparency and accountability.\\" Research and publications She has written about for-profit and non-profit private involvement with various aspects of the US foreign aid budget, including providing emergency humanitarian relief, development assistance, as well as post-conflict reconstruction efforts. Her work also discusses the phenomenon of private entities that have started to perform tasks she describes as \\"core military functions\\". Dickinson is author of the book Outsourcing War and Peace (2011). The book acknowledges that privatization of the military is \\"likely to be a fact of life for twenty-first century military activity\\". She notes that a process that began during William Cohens tenure as Secretary of Defense was significantly expanded under Donald Rumsfeld and his successor Robert Gates. In a review published by The American Journal of International Law Scott Horton wrote that the book \\"stands alone as the first serious engagement\\" of the private security contractor industry at the \\"level of law and legal policy\\".

It is a cylindrical, unsegmented worm with a crown of tentacles around the mouth. These worms live in crevices in the rocks or in burrows in shallow water in Western Europe, and the eastern United States. Description Reaching a maximum length of about , Nephasoma minutum, like all peanut worms, has a cylindrical trunk and a narrower, retractable anterior section known as the introvert. The mouth is at the end of the introvert which can be extended to feed or retracted into the body at other times. In this species the trunk is in excess of three times as long as its width and the introvert is a similar length to the trunk, which is cylindrical and smooth. There are two tentacles and up to six irregular lobular projections near the mouth and there are a few irregularly-arranged, spine-like hooks near the tip of the introvert, but these may be absent in adults. This peanut worm varies in colour, and may be white, yellowish-grey or orange. This description applies to populations in the northeastern Atlantic that are hermaphrodites; other populations with slightly differing characteristics, and some which are gonochoristic (having separate sexes), are often additionally referred to as Nephasoma minutum, which is likely to be a \\"taxonomic wastebasket\\". Distribution and habitat The range of N. minutum in the northeastern Atlantic Ocean extends from Sweden to the British Isles and the coast of France. It is also reported from the eastern and western coasts of the United States. Present from the lower intertidal zone down to about , it burrows into sand, gravel and mud or hides in crevices in the rock. Ecology A detritivore, N. minutum unselectively collects organic particles with its tentacles and ingests them when the introvert is drawn in. It is a hermaphrodite; most eggs laid by this class are spherical, but N. minutum produces large, elongate eggs with yolks on which the larvae can feed for two months during their direct development.

He played college basketball for the Marshall Thundering Herd before starting his professional career with √ç√ær√≥ttaf√©lag Reykjav√≠kur in the √örvalsdeild karla. College career Talyor joined Marshall in 2012 but redshirted his freshman year. He played 31 of 33 games in 2013‚Äì2014, starting 29 games and averaging 12.8 points and team leading 7.2 rebounds. In 2014‚Äì2015 he led Marshall in scoring and rebounding, with 14.1 points and 8.6 rebounds per game, and was selected to the All-Conference USA Third Team. In November 2016, Taylor was suspended by coach Dan D'Antoni for one game after he had been ejected from Marshalls 71‚Äì61 victory over Jackson State. Taylor had fouled out in the game and had continued to berate the referee from the bench, leading to his ejection. On January 10, 2017, Taylor was named the Oscar Robertson National Player of the Week after he averaged 25.3 points and 13.3 rebounds in Marshall's three victories during the week of January 2‚Äì7. During the season he passed Dan D'Antoni and Mike D'Antoni on Marshalls all-time scoring list and became the 50th player to break the 1000 point barrier in the schools history. In 2017 he became the first Marshall player to reach career totals of 1,500 points, 800 rebounds and 250 assists. Club career Taylor signed with √örvalsdeild karla club √çR in September 2017. He quickly established himself as one of the top players in the country and in December 2017, he was named the best player of the first half of the season. On March 5, Taylor made the game saving block on Haukar's Haukur √ìskarsson three point attempt at the buzzer in √çR's 64‚Äì62 victory. √çR ended the regular season with the second best record in the league and faced Stjarnan in the first round of the playoffs. In the third game of the series on March 22, Taylor struck Stjarnan's center, Hlynur B√¶ringsson, in the back of the head which resulted in Hlynur getting a concussion and missing both the rest of the game and the rest of the playoffs. As the referees did not see the hit clearly, Taylor was not ejected from the game and √çR won a 67‚Äì64 victory. Two days later, Taylor received a three-game suspension from the league for the hit. Without Taylor, √çR managed to edge out victory in the fourth game with a 24-point, 21-rebound performance by Danero Thomas, winning the series 3‚Äì1. Taylor returned in the third game of √çR's semi-finals series against Tindast√≥ll. After splitting the first two games, Tindast√≥ll went on to win the next two, eliminating √çR 3-1 from the playoffs. In 2019, he played for the Indianapolis Blaze in the Central Basketball Association where he helped the team to the CBA championship. In 5 games for the Blaze, Taylor averaged 11.0 points and 7.2 rebounds per game. The Basketball Tournament In July 2018, Taylor played for the West Virginia Wildcats in The Basketball Tournament, a winner-take-all $2 million, single-elimination event. He had a double-double,16 points and 10 rebounds, in the Wildcats first game, an 114‚Äì87 victory against 17th-seeded Charlotte Chess Center on July 20. The following day he led the team with 18 points and 11 rebounds but was unable to prevent a 99‚Äì68 loss against Scarlet & Gray, a team of mostly Ohio State University basketball alumni, which knocked them out of the tournament. In 2020, Taylor joined Herd That, a team comprised primarily of Marshall alumni, in The Basketball Tournament 2020. Coaching career In 2019, Taylor was named the head boy's basketball coach at St. Joseph Central Catholic High School in Huntington, West Virginia.

Each NOC could enter a maximum of 14 judokas (one in each division). Host nation Japan has reserved a spot in each of all 14 events, while twenty are made available to NOCs through a Tripartite Commission Invitation. The remaining judoka must undergo a qualifying process to earn a spot for the Games through the world ranking list prepared by International Judo Federation on June 28, 2021. The top 18 athletes in each division directly qualify, though each NOC is subjected to a limit of 1 judoka per division. If an NOC contains more than a single athlete ranked in the top 18 of the world ranking list, the NOC can decide which of their athletes obtain the quota places. Further continental quotas (13 men and 12 women for Europe, 12 of each gender for Africa, 10 men and 11 women for Pan America, 10 of each gender for Asia, and 5 of each gender for Oceania are also available. These quotas are assigned by creating a list of all athletes for each continent across all divisions and both genders. The top-ranked athletes qualify in turn, subject to the general rule of 1 athlete per NOC per division as well as the additional rule that each NOC may only qualify one judoka through the continental quotas (that is, ensuring that 100 different NOCs are represented through this qualification system). Mixed team qualification was based on NOCs qualifying enough individual judokas across various divisions to have a six-person team meeting specific requirements (one man and one woman in each of three groups of divisions).

It was designed to provide flexible unmanned aircraft vehicle (UAV) support, where soldiers can input the specific requirements they need, such as size, weight, and endurance, into the mission-planning software before the drone is configured and 3D printed within 24 hours. The process allows the manufacturing of additional drone parts as needed, eliminating the need to carry spare parts for different configurations. While a 3D printer constructs the body of the UAV, the motors, sensors, cameras, propellers, and other apparatus would have to be obtained from a standing inventory. The device can be tasked for missions involving perimeter surveillance, aerial defense, and reconnaissance. On December 2016, ARL researchers first tested it at Fort Benning, Georgia as part of the Army Expeditionary Warrior Experiments (AEWE) program. The researchers were given feedback s for possible improvements, such as improved agility, noise reduction, and heavier payload capacity. The ODSUAS was shown to demonstrate flight speeds of up to 55 miles per hour. ARL researchers have stated that the manufacturing of 3D printed drones is only the first step of the project and that the overall goal is to leverage 3D printing as a way to produce mission-specific tools in a short amount of time.

Biography Birck was born in Porto Alegre, Rio Grande do Sul, on August 13, 1965. He is the nephew of both screenwriter and theater director Carlos Augusto de Campos Velho (better known as Jota Pingo) and film and television actor Paulo C√©sar Pereio, and his mother, Rosa Maria de Campos Velho, was the director of the Teatro de Arena de Porto Alegre. Having a penchant for music and arts since his youth, Birck later graduated in music from the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul, and then obtained a master's degree in music education at the Federal University of Goi√°s. In 1983, alongside his younger brother Alexandre Birck, future TNT guitarist Lu√≠s \\"Tch√™\\" Gomes and future Os Cascavelletes bassist Frank Jorge, Marcelo formed the short-lived band Pris√£o de Ventre, which lasted only for two years. In 1987 he reunited with his brother and Jorge to form, alongside Carlo Pianta, the cult band Graforreia Xilarm√¥nica. After releasing two critically acclaimed albums, Coisa de Louco II (1995) and Chapinhas de Ouro (1998), they broke up in 2000, but reunited after a 5-year hiatus. In 1988, Birck founded a more experimental and \\"performatic\\" side project to Graforreia Xilarm√¥nica, named Arist√≥teles de Ananias Jr., alongside names such as Luciano Zanatta, Diego Silveira and Chico Machado. They have released a single, self- titled studio album in 1996 before disbanding the following year.Arist√≥teles de Ananias Jr. In 2000 Birck teamed up with Thomas Dreher and Felipe Faraco to form Os Atonais; their first (and so far only) studio album, Em Amplitude Moderada, came out the same year, amid overwhelmingly positive reviews. Later that year he released his first, self-titled solo album. A follow-up, Timbres N√£o Mentem Jamais, came out in 2008. Birck has also collaborated with Jupiter Apple on his 1997 debut A S√©tima Efervesc√™ncia, arranging one of the musician's most well-known songs, \\"Eu e Minha Ex\\". He later returned for its 1999 follow-up Plastic Soda. In 2009 he was a guest musician on Rog√©rio Skylab's live album Skylab IX; he and Skylab (a huge fan of Birck) wrote together the song \\"Samba de uma Nota S√≥ ao Contr√°rio\\". From 2002 to 2003 he served as a lecturer of musical analysis for the Santa Catarina State University.

The island was formed by a series of volcanic eruptions that formed large deposits of pumice and dacite. The island's name translates to \\"Old Burnt Island\\".  History  Palea Kameni was formed by a series of eruptions between 197 BCE and 47 CE. The appearance of the island was first noted in the journal of Roman scientist Cassius Dio, who wrote \\"This year [47 CE] a small islet, hitherto unknown, made an appearance close to the island of Thera.\\" The island was gradually built up by further volcanic activity, though outright eruptions ceased by the end of the 1st century CE. No signs of activity were reported on the island until 726, when the island suffered an explosive eruption of pumice. Volcanic activity then ceased again until the 1500s, when the development of Palea's sister island Nea Kameni caused increased volcanic activity to be reported. Other ancient authors note that it arose from the sea in 197 BCE and was given the name Hiera (), a name frequently given in antiquity to volcanic mountains. This fact is stated by Eusebius, Justin, Strabo, and Plutarch. It is related by Strabo that flames burst out of the sea for four days, and that an island was formed 12 stadia or in circumference.Euseb. Chron. p. 144, Olymp. 145. 4; Justin, 30.4; Plut. de Pyth. Or. 11. p. 399; The island lies to the southwest of Nea Kameni. Though the island is for the most part uninhabited, several structures (including a small church) are located on the island. Due to a lack of good harbors, most recreational watercraft do not stop at the island, though tourists can swim to the island from nearby Nea Kameni. Like the larger island to its east, Palea Kameni is sparsely vegetated with succulent plants. A herd of goats is present on the island, as is a single inhabitant, Sostice Arvanitis. The island also contains a hot spring.

Pin Cushion premiered as the opening film of International Critics' Week at the 74th Venice International Film Festival and was released in the United Kingdom on 13 July 2018.  Plot  Mother Lyn and daughter Iona (a.k.a. Dafty One and Dafty Two) are excited to be starting a new life in a small Midlands town. Determined to make a success of things after a tricky start at a new school, the gawky Iona becomes ‚Äòbest friends‚Äô with Keeley, Stacey and Chelsea. Used to having Iona to herself, Lyn feels left out and tries unsuccessfully to make her own friends starting with Belinda, her sour-faced neighbour. As much as Lyn and Iona pretend to each other that things are going well, Iona struggles with schoolmates who act more like 'frenemies' than friends, and Lyn is treated with varying degrees of indifference by neighbours and a supposed support group.

The house the main characters move into can be found in Hastings Road, Swadlincote. Haywood chose to shoot part of the film at her old school because she \\"had such an awful time there. Before the film I used to close my eyes when I would drive past, now when I drive past I have great memories of making a film there.\\" The graffiti written about her in the past had been painted over in the intervening years.  Reception  Pin Cushion has received positive reviews from critics. On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 89%, based on 36 reviews with an average rating of 7.1/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \\"Pin Cushion explores the prickly dynamics of mother-daughter relationships and female friendships, led by striking work from leads Lily Newmark and Joanna Scanlan.\\" Metacritic gives the film a weighted average score of 74 out of 100, based on 8 critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\".

She is known for her plaster castings of manhole covers on the streets of New York City in the 1960s, during which time she was ‚Äúerroneously being identified as a Pop artist.‚Äù In her work Jagger ‚Äú[appropriates] materials from nature,‚Äù and incorporates tracings, rubbings, and castings of found objects in both urban and rural environments.  Personal life  Gillian Jagger was born in the United Kingdom in 1930. Her father, sculptor Charles Sergeant Jagger, was known for his war memorials, most notably the Royal Artillery Memorial at Hyde Park Corner in London. Jagger‚Äôs maternal grandmother was also a sculptor. After the death of her father Jagger‚Äôs mother remarried, when she was aged 7, to an American coal industrialist and the family relocated to Buffalo, New York. The artist has worked and resided in a converted \\"five-barn\\" dairy farm in Kerhonkson, New York with her partner Consuelo (Connie) Mander since 1978.  Early career  In 1953 Jagger received her BFA in painting at Carnegie Tech (now Carnegie Mellon University), where artist Andy Warhol was also an alumnus. Although Jagger and Warhol were contemporaries and ‚Äúfriends,‚Äù Jagger disaffiliated herself from the Pop Art movement associated with Warhol‚Äôs Factory. She writes: > ‚Äú‚Ä¶the worst for me was that I was identified on all those news programmes > and newspapers as a Pop artist. I was certain that I wasn‚Äôt. I didn‚Äôt know > much about Pop Art ‚Äì but I knew I did not like beer cans or pieces of pie > under plastic covers.‚Äù Jagger later studied under Vaclav Vytlacil at the Colorado Springs Fine Arts Center, Colorado; and completed further studies at the University of Buffalo, New York and Columbia University. She received a Masters of Art from New York University in 1960. Later career In 1968 Jagger joined the faculty of Pratt Institute in Brooklyn, where she taught for 40 years. She also held teaching positions at New York University, Post University, and New Rochelle Academy. She died in New York.  Work  Gillian Jagger worked in large-scale plaster, stone, cast cement, and sheet lead; as well as found biogenic substances such as animal carcasses and sections of fallen tree trunks. Often the artist casts readymade materials from nature, including her own body. ‚ÄúAn interest in time, tracks, imprints and shadows has long dominated my work,‚Äù she writes. In her early work Jagger cast automobile tracks, footprints, and various infrastructural elements of the urban built environment. Her castings of manhole covers on the streets of New York City attracted attention from local and national news media during the early 1960s. At the time Jagger was being misidentified as a Pop artist. She explains, however, that this epithet was ‚Äúa distortion of what [she] was actually trying to achieve.‚Äù ‚ÄúThat wasn‚Äôt what I was going for,‚Äù she said, ‚ÄúI was trying to make a statement about what would be here when we were all gone.‚Äù Jagger later said of the period: ‚ÄúI was casting facts because I couldn‚Äôt believe in the metaphors.‚Äù  References  Category:1930 births Category:2019 deaths Category:New York University alumni Category:English sculptors Category:20th-century American sculptors Category:Pratt Institute faculty ","title":"Gillian Jagger"},{"id":"57895697","text":"Dani√´l Clarembaux (1883‚Äì?) was a Belgian rower.

She was president of the Texas State Historical Association (19151925). Early life Adele Briscoe Looscan was born Adele Lubbock Briscoe on 5 February 1848. Her father was Andrew Briscoe, signer of the Texas Declaration of Independence and the first Chief Justice of Harris County. Her mother, Mary Jane (Harris) Briscoe, descended from an early settler and namesake of Harris County, John Richardson Harris. He also founded Harrisburg, Texas, which was taken over and overseen by her grandmother, Jane Birdsall Briscoe. She was named for one of her country neighbors, Adele Lubbock, the wife of Harris County Clerk and future Texas Governor, Francis Richard Lubbock.McLemore (2015), p. 153. Adele's father died when she was less than two-years old. The family moved to Mississippi to live with her paternal grandfather, General Parmenas Briscoe. After his death in 1851, Mary Jane Briscoe lost their residence in Mississippi and moved to Anderson, Texas in 1852. Seven years later she returned with her family to her hometown of Harrisburg, Texas. With the school at Harrisburg closed, Adele attended Miss Browne's School for Young Ladies (Houston) from 1861, where she graduated as valedictorian in 1866.McLemore (2015), pp. 154155. Adele married Major Michael Looscan on September 13, 1881.

In February 1885, Looscan started a club at her mother's home in Houston to promote ‚Äúintellectual and social culture.‚Äù A few months later her club had attracted thirty-five members, and become known as the Ladies‚Äô Reading Club. Members collaborated in collecting periodicals and books to create a club library. By 1900, Looscan organized a coalition of local clubs to form the City Federation of Woman's Clubs, which sponsored social events and raised money to buy a lot in Houston. The club's land purchase, combined with city of Houston and Carnegie grants, culminated in the opening of Houston's first public library on March 2, 1904.McLemore (2015), pp. 158‚Äì159. Looscan and her mother hosted meetings to establish the Daughters of the Lone Star Republic (DRT) in 1891.McLemore (2015), pp. 159‚Äì160. She poured her energy into recruitment for new members. She met resistance from many prospects, but persuaded Adina De Zavala, a granddaughter of the first Vice-President of Texas.McLemore (2015), p. 160. Looscan published writings in major Texas newspapers and some Texas literary magazines. Most famously, she published her mother's memoir of the ‚ÄúFirst Anniversary Ball of the Battle of San Jacinto.‚Äù She wrote frequently about Texas history, but also submitted essays about education and gender issues. Her works caught the attention of Dora Fowler Arthur, editor of Texas Magazine, who offered column space to the DRT in 1896. She wrote articles for Dudley G. Wooten's Comprehensive History of Texas and for his New History of Texas for Schools.McLemore (2015), pp. 161‚Äì162. Looscan was a combatant in a schism within the DRT about the Alamo site in San Antonio. De Zavala, who had established an eponymous chapter of the DRT, was adamant about historical restoration and preservation. Looscan supported De Zavala and her principles. Clara Driscoll advocated remaking the site as an urban park. The acrimony of the debate resulted in Looscan withdrawing from the DRT.McLemore (2015), pp. 165‚Äì166. The Texas State Historical Association (TSHA), organized in 1897, recruited Looscan and other writers from the women's clubs and trained them for scholarly historical writing. After the Alamo dispute, Looscan and De Zavala remained engaged with the TSHA, though many other women dropped out in reaction to the Alamo dispute. Looscan continued to write and recruit other writers for the TSHA. In 1915, Eugene C. Barker appointed Looscan to serve as president of the Texas State Historical Commission. She promoted TSHA's magazine, with a focus on Houston as a base of expansion, approaching Rice Institute and various women's clubs.McLemore (2015), 167‚Äì169. Looscan resigned as president of TSHA in 1925, but remained active in the Association for the Preservation of the Historical Landmarks in Texas and the United Daughters of the Confederacy.McLemore (2015), pp. 170‚Äì171. Death and legacy Grave marker for Adele Briscoe Looscan, Glenwood Cemetery, Houston. Looscan died in Houston on November 23, 1935 and was interred at Glenwood Cemetery.

Because German orthography is largely phonemic, transcription into Cyrillic follows relatively simple rules. Russian and Bulgarian The standard rules for orthographic transcription into Russian were developed by Rudzhero S. Giliarevski (ru) and Boris A.

I. Ermolovich (ru) and I. S. Alexeyeva (ru). The established spellings of a few names which were already common before this time sometimes deviates from these rules; for example, the Ludwig is traditionally –õ—é–¥–≤–∏–≥ (including in placenames), with —é instead of —É. It was also historically common to render personal names into their Russian forms or cognates, rather than strictly transliterating them, as with Peter being rendered as –ü—ë—Ç—Ä. German phonemes which do not exist in Russian are rendered by their closest approximations: the umlauts √∂ and √º are rendered as —ë (yo) and —é (yu), and √§ and e are mostly rendered as –µ (not —ç). H (when not part of a cluster) is now rendered with —Ö or omitted (when silent); it was historically often rendered with –≥ (g), as in the name of Heinrich Heine (Russian: –ì–µ–Ω—Ä–∏—Ö –ì–µ–π–Ω–µ).

Preparations The Committee's ‚ÄúBasic Policy‚Äù document includes elements to highlight the appeal of Japan and Tokyo to the world; including feedback from experts and opinions of the Japanese public.

Marco Balich, Balich Worldwide Shows, is the producer. He unveiled, at Spazio Campania in Milan, the first details of the inauguration of the Universiade on stage at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples on 3 July. \\"As Balich Worldwide Shows we are very focused on the 2019 Summer Universiade, then we will all go to Lima for the 2019 Pan American Games, so I will be involved in the production of the opening and closing ceremonies of the Tokyo 2020 Summer Olympics, in association with the Japanese advertising company Dentsu\\", he explained. Earlier he helped to produce some of the recent games opening ceremonies as 2006 Winter Olympics, 2014 Winter Olympics and the well- praised 2016 Summer Olympics opening and closing ceremonies. According to Inside the Games, Mario, the famous plumber who stars in numerous Nintendo games, is in line to take \\"centre stage\\" with organizers hoping to deliver a message of peace. At Rio 2016, Prime Minister of Japan, Shinzo Abe dressed up as Mario in the handover segment of the Closing Ceremony. The message of peace could also be displayed by the release of paper cranes and doves. People riding in flying cars in the future might be used to highlight Japanese innovation and technology, meanwhile. This could also see hydrogen, a next- generation energy source, used as the fuel which lights the Olympic cauldron. The Japanese leg of the 2020 Summer Olympics torch relay will begin in Fukushima with some using the term \\"Reconstruction Olympics\\". Japan's fight against natural disasters could also be a theme of the Olympic Opening Ceremony, which was planned to be held at Tokyo's New National Stadium on Friday, July 24. Kaoru Sugano Dentsu's creative director for Tokyo Olympic ceremonies, resigned in January 2020 over harassment controversies. In February 2020, after announcements concerning scaling back the Tokyo marathon, Health officials have begun to question whether the Olympic opening ceremony would also be impacted. On 24 March 2020, the IOC and the Tokyo Organizing Committee officially announced that due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the 2020 Summer Olympics and Paralympics would be delayed to 2021, and held no later than summer 2021 (marking the first time that an entire Olympics have ever been postponed). On 30 March 2020, it was announced that the ceremony will take place on 23 July 2021. It was also revealed that the coronavirus crisis will be mentioned at some point during the ceremony due to its significance at the games. Performers Anthems * - Kimigayo, Japanese National Anthem * - Olympic Anthem Venue The New National Stadium was to serve as the main stadium for the opening ceremony.

It is set within the Alpine Lakes Wilderness which is part of the Cascade Range. Red Mountain is situated three miles north of Snoqualmie Pass on land managed by Mount Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest. The nearest higher neighbor is Lundin Peak, to the northwest. Precipitation runoff on the north side of the mountain drains into Middle Fork of the Snoqualmie River, whereas the south side of the mountain drains into the South Fork Snoqualmie River via Commonwealth Creek. Climate Red Mountain is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008.Red Mountain in winter Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades (Orographic lift). As a result, the west side of the Cascades experiences high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer. Because of maritime influence, snow tends to be wet and heavy, resulting in high avalanche danger. The months July through September offer the most favorable weather for viewing or climbing this peak. Geology Red Mountain from Commonwealth Basin The Alpine Lakes Wilderness features some of the most rugged topography in the Cascade Range with craggy peaks and ridges, deep glacial valleys, and granite walls spotted with over 700 mountain lakes. Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to the various climate differences. The history of the formation of the Cascade Mountains dates back millions of years ago to the late Eocene Epoch. With the North American Plate overriding the Pacific Plate, episodes of volcanic igneous activity persisted. In addition, small fragments of the oceanic and continental lithosphere called terranes created the North Cascades about 50 million years ago. During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured and shaped the landscape. The last glacial retreat in the Alpine Lakes area began about 14,000 years ago and was north of the Canada‚ÄìUS border by 10,000 years ago. The \\"U\\"-shaped cross section of the river valleys are a result of that recent glaciation. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the Alpine Lakes Wilderness area.

Early life and education  Miller was born in Oak Park, Illinois. He earned his Bachelor of Arts in physics, magna cum laude, from Harvard College in 1996. Miller then attended the University of Chicago Law School, earning a Juris Doctor in 1999 with highest honors. In law school, he was inducted into the Order of the Coif and served as the topics and comments editor of the University of Chicago Law Review.  Career  Upon graduation from law school, Miller served as a law clerk to Judge Laurence Silberman of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit and later to Associate Justice Clarence Thomas of the Supreme Court of the United States. Early in his career, Miller served in the Department of Justice as an Attorney-Advisor in the Office of Legal Counsel (2003‚Äì2004) and as a member of the Appellate Staff in the Civil Division (2001‚Äì2003, 2004‚Äì2006). Miller also served as Deputy General Counsel of the Federal Communications Commission (2006‚Äì2007) and spent five years (2007‚Äì2012) as an Assistant to the Solicitor General in the Office of the Solicitor General within the Department of Justice. He received the Attorney General's Distinguished Service Award in 2008 for his work on national security litigation. Before becoming a judge, Miller was a partner at Perkins Coie from 2012 to 2019 in the firm's Seattle office. In that capacity, he served as the firm-wide chair of Perkins Coie's appellate practice. Miller is also a part-time lecturer at the University of Washington School of Law. He has argued more than sixty appeals, including sixteen before the Supreme Court of the United States.  Federal judicial service  On July 13, 2018, President Trump announced his intent to nominate Miller to serve as a United States Circuit Judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. On July 19, 2018, his nomination was sent to the Senate. President Trump nominated Miller to the seat vacated by Judge Richard C. Tallman, who took senior status on March 3, 2018.\\"One Nomination Sent to the Senate Today\\", White House, July 19, 2018 On October 24, 2018, a hearing on his nomination was held before the Senate Judiciary Committee.United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary: Nominations for October 24, 2018 On January 3, 2019, his nomination was returned to the President under Rule XXXI, Paragraph 6 of the United States Senate.

With a redshift of 0.3365 ¬± 0.0010, it is about from Earth. Its approximate location on the sky is off the left shoulder of the constellation Orion. Discovered as a radio source in 1983, the blazar has since been observed across the entire electromagnetic spectrum. TXS 0506+056 is the first known source of high energy astrophysical neutrinos, identified following the IceCube-170922A neutrino event in an early example of multi-messenger astronomy. The only astronomical sources previously observed by neutrino detectors were the Sun and supernova 1987A, which were detected decades earlier at much lower neutrino energies. Observational history The object has been detected by numerous astronomical surveys, so has numerous valid source designations. The most commonly used, TXS 0506+056, comes from its inclusion in the Texas Survey of radio sources (standard abbreviation TXS) and its approximate equatorial coordinates in the B1950 equinox used by that survey. Location of TXS 0506+056 as observed in gamma rays (energies greater than 1 GeV) by the Fermi Space Telescope TXS 0506+056 was first discovered as a radio source in 1983. It was identified as an active galaxy in the 1990s, and a possible blazar in the early 2000s. By 2009 it was regarded as a confirmed blazar and catalogued as a BL Lac object. Gamma rays from TXS 0506+056 were detected by the EGRET and Fermi Space Telescope missions. Radio observations using very-long-baseline interferometry have shown apparent superluminal motion in the blazar's jet. TXS 0506+056 is one of the blazars regularly monitored by the OVRO 40 meter Telescope, so has an almost-continuous radio light curve recorded from 2008 onwards. The gamma-ray flux from TXS 0506+056 is highly variable, by at least a factor of a thousand, but on average it is in the top 4% of brightest gamma-ray sources on the sky. It is also very bright in radio waves, in the top 1% of sources. Given its distance, this makes TXS 0506+056 one of the most intrinsically powerful BL Lac objects known, particularly in high-energy gamma rays. Neutrino emission On September 22, 2017, the IceCube Neutrino Observatory detected a high energy muon neutrino, dubbed IceCube-170922A. The neutrino carried an energy of ~290 tera‚Äìelectronvolts (TeV); for comparison, the Large Hadron Collider can generate a maximum energy of 13 TeV. Within one minute of the neutrino detection, IceCube sent an automated alert to astronomers around the world with coordinates to search for a possible source. A search of this region in the sky, 1.33 degrees across, yielded only one likely source: TXS 0506+056, a previously-known blazar, which was found to be in a flaring state of high gamma ray emission. It was subsequently observed at other wavelengths of light across the electromagnetic spectrum, including radio, infrared, optical, X-rays and gamma-rays. The detection of both neutrinos and light from the same object was an early example of multi-messenger astronomy. A search of archived neutrino data from IceCube found evidence for an earlier flare of lower-energy neutrinos in 2014-2015 (a form of precovery), which supports identification of the blazar as a source of neutrinos. An independent analysis found no gamma-ray flare during this earlier period of neutrino emission, but supported its association with the blazar. The neutrinos emitted by TXS 0506+056 are six orders of magnitude higher in energy than those from any previously-identified astrophysical neutrino source. The observations of high energy neutrinos and gamma-rays from this source imply that it is also a source of cosmic rays, because all three should be produced by the same physical processes, though no cosmic rays from TXS 0506+056 have been directly observed. In the blazar, a charged pion was produced by the interaction of a high-energy proton or nucleus (i.e. a cosmic ray) with the radiation field or with matter. The pion then decayed into a lepton and the neutrino. The neutrino interacts only weakly with matter, so it escaped the blazar. Upon reaching Earth, the neutrino interacted with the Antarctic ice to produce a muon, which was observed by the Cherenkov radiation it generated as it moved through the IceCube detector. Analysis of 16 very long baseline radio array 15-GHz observations between 2009 and 2018 of TXS 0506+056 revealed the presence of a curved jet or potentially a collision of two jets, which could explain the 2014-2015 neutrino generation at the time of a low gamma-ray flux and indicate that TXS 0506+056 might be an atypical blazar.

Function The facility is designed to produce Uranium-235, which can be used in nuclear weapons. The United States believes that Kangson has an output double that of Yongbyon Nuclear Scientific Research Center, though some analysts say it may be only 20 percent larger. History The enrichment site was opened in the early 2000s, prior to the Yongbyon Nuclear Scientific Research Center. The United States intelligence community began observing construction at the site in 2007, and identified it as an enrichment facility in 2010. Some European intelligence agencies reportedly are unconvinced with the assessment that the site is used for uranium enrichment. American Analysts say that construction of the facility began in 2002 and may have been operational by 2003. In IAEA reports on North Korea in 2020, it was described that there are a group of buildings observation appear to be a uranium enrichment facility, and regular vehicle movements at the site suggest that activities are ongoing.

It is within the Alpine Lakes Wilderness on the crest of the Cascade Range. Kendall Peak is situated two miles northeast of Snoqualmie Pass on land managed by Mount Baker- Snoqualmie National Forest. Precipitation runoff on the east side of the mountain drains into Silver Creek and makes its way to the Columbia River via Yakima River, whereas the west side of the mountain drains into the South Fork Snoqualmie River via Commonwealth Creek. The Pacific Crest Trail traverses its west flank and an exposed section of the trail called Kendall Katwalk has seen tragic deaths over the years, most recently September 5, 2018.https://www.theolympian.com/latest-news/article218166455.html The nearest higher peak is Red Mountain, to the north-northwest. Climate Kendall Peak is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades (Orographic lift). As a result, the west side of the Cascades experiences high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer.Beckey, p. 16 Because of maritime influence, snow tends to be wet and heavy, resulting in high avalanche danger. Geology The Cascades feature rugged topography with craggy peaks, ridges, and deep glacial valleys. Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to the various climate differences. These climate differences lead to vegetation variety defining the ecoregions in this area. The history of the formation of the Cascade Mountains dates back millions of years ago to the late Eocene Epoch. With the North American Plate overriding the Pacific Plate, episodes of volcanic igneous activity persisted. During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured the landscape leaving deposits of rock debris. The \\"U\\"-shaped cross section of the river valleys are a result of recent glaciation. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys.

Radikal, 10 March 2013. Early life Hasanli was the son of Beyzade Murtaza Agha. After completing primary and secondary education in Dersim, he was taken to the Tribal Class of the Harp School on 3 October 1896. He was appointed to the 4th Army Siverek Tribal Cavalry Regiment, graduating with the rank of Lieutenant Cavalry on 24 February 1898.  Career  While he was in charge of the Van Military Service Branch, he became a deputy of Dersim at the election held for the last period of the Meclis-i Mebusan. In 1920, he served as a deputy of Dersim in the first period of the Turkish Grand National Assembly: He worked in the Parliament on Health and Social Aid, Petition, Economics, and National Defense Commissions. In the Sheikh Said Rebellion, Hasan Hayri was arrested and sentenced to death at the Eastern Independence Court, arguing that he participated in actions to help the insurgents.

Death In 1923, ≈ûerif Pasha demanded independence for the Kurdish people at the Congress of the Treaty of Lausanne, where Turkish nationalists were engaged in negotiations. Atat√ºrk ordered Hasan Hayri to go to parliament in Kurdish clothes, which were forbidden in Turkey, and testify that the Kurdish people did not want independence and wished to remain under Turkish governmental authority. Following the Congress of Lausanne, Hasan Hayri was arrested for wearing Kurdish clothes and for conspiracy against national security and was sentenced to death. He was hanged by Turkish forces following the court decision. Before his death he was asked his last request and said: \\"bury my body in the way of Kurdish people, till any Kurd passes from there spitting on my grave.\\" He called himself \\"Ker Hesen\\" (meaning Hasan the donkey, or idiot Hasan) and at the moment of hanging, shouted, \\"Uh Sheikh Said, Ker Hesen has been also martyred in the way of Kurdistan!\\" Hasan Hayri became a symbol of betrayal among the Kurds.

The therapy was developed by Dutch doctor Tinus Smits, who claimed to have used it to treat over 300 children with autism. It became more notable in 2017/2018 because of regulatory action taken by professional bodies in The Netherlands, UK, and Canada following a series of complaints about unfounded claims. Smits in the book Autism Beyond Despair ‚Äì CEASE Therapy stated that autistic children should never be vaccinated.  Regulatory action  In October 2017 the Dutch Advertising Code Foundation (Stichting Reclame Code) found that the official website for CEASE therapy was in breach of advertising regulations. In the United Kingdom, in April 2018 the Professional Standards Authority (PSA) placed some requirements on the Society of Homeopaths (SoH), due to concerns about the way in which members marketed CEASE therapy. The PSA asked the SoH to confirm \\"what action it will take to ensure children are safe as a condition of its re-accreditation\\". The following June the SoH published a position statement advising their members not to imply any cure of autism when marketing CEASE therapy. It has been estimated that more than 120 homeopaths are offering CEASE in the UK though not all are SoH members. In its December 2018 accreditation review for the Federation of Holistic Therapists (FHT) the PSA received confirmation from the Federation that none of its registered homeopath members offer CEASE, that any homeopath who offers CEASE would not be accepted onto its register, and that the FHT does not \\"accept, endorse or insure\\" CEASE therapy. In July 2015 the UK's Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) found Teddington Homeopathy's marketing of CEASE therapy in breach of the Advertising Standards Code. The following month the ASA added the company to its list of non-compliant online advertisers for \\"making unproven efficacy claims for CEASE therapy\\". In May 2018 the ASA wrote to homeopaths to remind them that \\"CEASE Therapists cannot claim to cure autism or make claims regarding detoxification\\" and in July 2018 they upheld an adjudication against Bubbling Life's website, determining that the claims relating to CEASE, vaccination, autism and ASD could discourage customers from seeking appropriate advice or treatment. In March 2019, the ASA published a statement that advertising of CEASE must stop and that they had referred several case to Trading Standards. In British Columbia, Canada, the Board of the College of Naturopathic Physicians investigated three CEASE practitioners following complaints from the public and subsequently \\"determined that naturopathic doctors in British Columbia must not advertise or offer CEASE therapy\\". As well as this prohibition the College's updated position statements also clarify that naturopathic doctors in BC must not offer anti-vaccination materials or advice (including on social media) and must not imply that vaccination causes autism. The American Food and Drug Administration (FDA) does not strictly regulate CEASE or homeopathic treatments. However, in response to a question about CEASE it has stated that \\"[the] FDA has warned about the use of products labeled as homeopathic because of concerns that they have not been shown to offer clinical benefits in treating serious and/or life-threatening medical conditions, and that they also may cause serious harm... It deeply concerns us when we see preventable diseases such as measles ‚Äì a life-threatening infection we thought we had eliminated in the US in 2000 ‚Äì now making a tragic comeback and threatening our communities, despite having a vaccine available that is safe and highly effective. A factor contributing to the measles outbreak is inaccurate and misleading information about vaccines rather than the reliance on accurate, scientific-based information.\\" In May 2019 Homeopathy International's steering group wrote to CEASE practitioners recommending that they consider changing the treatment's name to EASE (for 'Easing Autistic Spectrum Expression') to avoid the \\"significant legal risk\\" from using in their marketing material the original name or its acronym, either of which could be interpreted as \\"making illegal claims to cure\\". On 28 June 2019 the Good Thinking Society (GTS) charity filed a Judicial Review claim to challenge an earlier decision by the PSA to re- accredit the Society of Homeopaths' register. At the time of filing several (GTS alleges it to be over 50) SoH members were still offering CEASE therapy for autism.  Expert assessment  Speaking on the subject of CEASE and homeopathy, Peter Hotez, dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at the Baylor College of Medicine, said: \\"Measles outbreaks were both predicted and predictable as the anti-vaccine movement starts to affect public health in [the USA]. This is just the beginning ‚Äì it is a harbinger of a new normal in America... There are no alternatives to vaccination against measles and there is no cure to autism ‚Äì so it's all made up.\\"  References  Further reading *Disturbing claims by homeopaths at The Irish Times, 2012 *CEASE therapy for autism: Homeopathic quackery and ‚Äúself regulation‚Äù by naturopathic boards at Science-Based Medicine, 2018 *A Spectrum of Harmful interventions for Autism: a short report (PDF) from The Westminster Commission on Autism, 2018 Category:Homeopathy Category:Autism pseudoscience Category:Vaccine hesitancy Category:Unnecessary health care Category:Naturopathy ","title":"CEASE therapy"},{"id":"57896764","text":"Dunsforths is a civil parish in the Borough of Harrogate of North Yorkshire, England.Ordnance Survey linked data.

Calvin Case was born in Steuben County, NY in 1804. In the 1840 Census, he was recorded in Conesville, Schoharie County, NY with his family. He was shown as a tradesman. Case arrived in St. Louis, MO as a steamboat captain. The Republican issue of November 11, 1841 reported that riverboat Captain Case had opened a boatyard near the site of the old brewery in St. Louis.Frederick A. Hodes, Rising on the River: St. Louis 1822 to 1850, Explosive Growth from Town to City, Patrice Press, Tooele, UT, 2009, (v. 2), p 511. Case soon partnered with William Nelson to form Case & Nelson, a river salvaging business that operated on the Mississippi River from Galena, IL to the Gulf of Mexico. In 1842, James Eads affiliated with the salvage firm. He is best known for building Eads Bridge across the Mississippi River at St. Louis. In between his company built ironclad gunboats at Carondelet, MO for the Union during the Civil War. Later he built jetties in the Mississippi River delta to prevent silting. In 1842, he was inexperience and untrained, but energetic and mechanically inclined. He designed a diving bell to facilitate salvage. He joined Case & Nelson after showing them his design. His primitive diving bell consisted of a wine barrel with bottom removed and weighted with lead to settle on the bottom. In the early days Eads was the diver in the bell. The firm prospered salvaging valuable metals and other durable materials from riverboat wrecks. In September, 1843 Erastus Wells arrived in St. Louis from New York. Case financed the first omnibus company in St. Louis using a salvaged Army wagon. Wells originally drove the omnibus. By 1849, the company had expanded to 15 omnibus lines. In 1850, Case, Wells, and partners Lawrence Matthews and Robert McBlenis (O‚ÄôBlenis) consolidated the St. Louis omnibus lines under the name Case & Co.James Neal Primm, Lion of the Valley, St. Louis, Missouri, Pruett Publishing, Boulder, CO, 1981, p 198, In 1848, Captain Calvin Case of St. Louis was listed as a reference for the firm of Matteson & Preston of St. Louis, Commission and Forwarding Agents. In the 1850 Census, he was listed as an omnibus owner with family in St. Louis Ward 6. His assets were shown as $34,000. Case served as a director of the North Missouri Railroad from 1853 to 1855.Glasgow Weekly Times June 23, 1853 and April 12, 1855 He was killed in the Gasconade Bridge train disaster when a Pacific Railroad excursion train crashed through a temporary bridge over the Gasconade River on November 1, 1855. In 1856, Case & Co. was dissolved to settle his estate. Erastus Wells retained the Market Street & Chestnut and Olive St. omnibus lines. In 1859, they were converted to street railways with horse cars under the name Missouri Railroad Co. Wells served as president of Missouri Railroad until 1881. In 1887, the Olive Street line converted to cable cars, and was electrified to streetcars in 1901.George W.

One of the agency's first accomplishments was the construction of the valley‚Äôs first public swimming pool at Thousand Oaks High School in 1964. The agency received its largest land donation in December 1966, when Potrero Homes donated 1,250 acres of canyon- and mesa lands near California Lutheran University, now known as Wildwood Regional Park. The agency branches out throughout the late 1960s, sponsoring overnight camps, ball games, nature walks, and other activities. The agency made efforts since 1970 aimed at acquiring funds for a swimming pool at Newbury Park High School, which was constructed at the school in 1972. The district purchased the 30-acre Borchard Community Park in Newbury Park in February 1969. The Thousand Oaks Community Center was built in 1971, and the district acquired large parts of Lang Ranch in 1972.

It is a so-called federal scientific institution that operates under the authority of the federal minister of Public Health and the federal minister of Agriculture of Belgium. Sciensano's core business is scientific research in the fields of public health, animal health and food safety. Sciensano arose in 2018 from the merger of the former Veterinary and Agrochemical Research Centre (in Dutch: Centrum voor Onderzoek in Diergeneeskunde en Agrochemie, in French: Centre d‚Äô√âtude et de Recherches V√©t√©rinaires et Agrochimiques, often shortened to CODA-CERVA) and the former Scientific Institute of Public Health (in Dutch: Wetenschappelijk Instituut Volksgezondheid, in French: Institut Scientifique de Sant√© Publique, often shortened to WIV-ISP). Both institutions were merged because of their complementary activities and to be able to provide a comprehensive answer to the health challenges of the future. More particularly, the merger was based on the One Health principle that states that the areas of human health, animal health and the environment are inherently connected with each other. The merger became official on April 1, 2018.  Activities  * Environmental health: Sciensano researches and monitors environmental health and environmental threats to human health. For example, it assesses the risks posed to biosafety by genetically modified organisms (GMOs) and develops environmental indicators for a healthier and more environmentally friendly pesticide use. It also investigates the health impact of air pollution. * Food consumption and food safety: Sciensano analyses the dietary habits of the population and whether they meet the dietary recommendations. It also investigates the presence and impact of GMOs, food pathogens, food contaminants, pesticide residues, food additives, nanomaterials and other materials that come into contact with food. * Health and disease monitoring: through different methods, such as nationwide surveys, disease registries and networks of collaborating physicians, Sciensano collects data about the health of the population, for example about disabilities or medication consumption. This data allows health authorities to evaluate and adjust health policy. It also follows up on the epidemiology of infectious diseases such as AIDS, influenza, salmonella and bronchitis, of zoonoses such as brucellosis and rabies and of chronic diseases that are linked to wealth, such as cardiovascular disease, cancer and diabetes. This allows Sciensano to detect and evaluate threats, and to support health authorities in their fight against these diseases. * Quality of health care: together with the Belgian Health Care Knowledge Centre and the National Institute for Health and Disability Insurance, Sciensano evaluates the quality of the Belgian health care system. For this purpose, it makes use of health indicators, coordinates national databases, keeps track of hospital-acquired infections, makes complex medical diagnoses as a scientific reference authority, and more. Sciensano's end goal is to improve the quality of health care and patient outcomes. * Vaccines, medications and health products: Sciensano supports the Belgian Federal Agency for Medicines and Health Products by assessing the safety and effectiveness of vaccines, medications and other health products. For example, it performs quality control on medications and vaccines, investigates illegal and counterfeit medications and researches antibiotic resistance. In addition, Sciensano analyses samples of certain illegal drugs within the framework of the Belgian Early Warning System Drugs. * Quality of medical laboratories: Sciensano is responsible for the inspection and certification of medical laboratories in Belgium, especially with regard to samples of human origin. It supervises the correct handling of sample material and the use of standardised analytical methods, and provides external quality assurance. * Animal health: Sciensano supports the Belgian Federal Agency for the Safety of the Food Chain, the Federal Public Service Public Health, Food Chain Safety and Environment and front-line organisations in their tasks related to animal health and food safety. To this end, it monitors zoonoses as well as epizootics for the impact they may have on human health through the food chain as well as purely for their socio-economical impact on animal husbandry.

The concert took place the year after Wyatt had fallen from a fourth-storey window and become paralysed from the waist down. Since the accident, Wyatt has used a wheelchair. The concert remains Wyatt's first and only live performance as a headlining solo artist. The concert served as the live premiere of Wyatt's studio album Rock Bottom, which had been released a little over a month prior. In addition to the songs from Rock Bottom, the set list included cover of songs by Wyatt's former bands; a performance by Julie Tippetts of her own song, \\"Mind of a Child\\"; and most notably, an extended version of \\"I'm a Believer\\", a song written by Neil Diamond for American pop-rock band The Monkees. Wyatt had just recorded and released his cover of \\"I'm a Believer\\", which became a surprise hit single in the UK. The assembled band, dubbed Robert Wyatt & Friends, included most of the musicians from the Rock Bottom recording sessions and several guests. Robert Wyatt & Friends consisted of Dave Stewart, Laurie Allan, Hugh Hopper of Soft Machine, Mongezi Feza, Gary Windo, Mike Oldfield, Nick Mason of Pink Floyd, Fred Frith of Henry Cow, Julie Tippetts, and Ivor Cutler. The BBC Radio 1 DJ John Peel gave an introduction for Wyatt. Contemporaneous reviews of the concert were positive. After the concert, Wyatt continued his recording career but stopped performing as a solo artist due to the difficulties of organizing a live backing band and his chronic, intense stage fright. Bootleg recordings of the concert emerged in the early 1980s. The official release in 2005 received generally favorable reviews, with critics praising the album as a showcase for Wyatt's vocals and a compelling document of the progressive Canterbury scene. Simon Reynolds wrote a]larming but true: one of the best releases of 2005 was recorded 31 years ago.\\" However, the official release suffers from inconsistent sound quality because about half of the original recordings had been lost.  Background  In the late 1960s and early 70s, Robert Wyatt was known as an English songwriter, singer, and drummer associated with the Canterbury scene of prog-rock musicians. Wyatt was kicked out of the band Soft Machine in 1971 and then formed his own band, Matching Mole. After releasing two records, Wyatt dissolved Matching Mole, feeling overwhelmed by his responsibilities as bandleader. Still, he began writing new music with the intention of reuniting the band for a third Matching Mole album. But plans for a third Matching Mole record were cut short in 1973 when Wyatt, heavily intoxicated from drinking, fell from a fourth-story window. He survived, but was left paralysed from the waist down. Since the accident occurred, Wyatt has used a wheelchair and no longer plays the drums. During the time spent recovering in hospital, Wyatt further developed the songs he'd intended to use for Matching Mole. These songs were ultimately recorded and released in 1974 as a solo record, Rock Bottom. His first album on Virgin Records, Rock Bottom was released on 26 July 1974, the same day as Wyatt's wedding to Alfreda Benge (known as Alfie). The British music press lauded Rock Bottom upon its release. Wyatt recorded Rock Bottom with musicians from both the progressive rock and jazz scenes. Dissatisfied with jazz fusion as it had existed previously, which he felt typically took the \\"worst of both worlds\\" from each genre with excessive \\"noodling,\\" Wyatt sought to achieve a novel, \\"upside down\\" style of jazz-rock fusion all his own on Rock Bottom. Musically, Rock Bottom combined the \\"looseness,\\" \\"rhythm section,\\" improvisation and instrumentation of jazz with the song-form structure of rock or folk music. The songs of Rock Bottom would form the centerpiece of the Drury Lane concert, which featured musicians from both the rock and jazz traditions.  The concert at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane   Planning and promotion  Most of the lineup of Robert Wyatt and Friends in a promo photo used for the concert poster and an NME cover. Clockwise from bottom: Wyatt, Mike Oldfield, Gary Windo, Dave Stewart, Laurie Allan, Nick Mason, Mongezi Feza, Julie Tippetts. To promote Rock Bottom, a headlining performance by Wyatt was held on 8 September 1974 at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, a West End theatre in London. The concert was reportedly arranged by the Virgin Records executive Richard Branson, who told Wyatt that certain musicians had expressed interest in performing as Wyatt's backing band for a concert. Meanwhile, Branson also told the same musicians that Wyatt had expressed interest in recruiting them for his live band. The one-off backing band assembled for the concert, dubbed Robert Wyatt & Friends, included most of the musicians featured on Rock Bottom along with several other guests. The band included Wyatt's \\"dream rhythm section\\" of Dave Stewart on keyboards, Laurie Allan on drums, and Hugh Hopper on bass guitar. Other performers from the Rock Bottom sessions included Mongezi Feza on trumpet, Mike Oldfield on guitar, Fred Frith on several stringed instruments, and Ivor Cutler on spoken word vocals. Nick Mason, the drummer of Pink Floyd and producer of Rock Bottom, made a guest appearance on drums. Julie Tippetts, who was not involved in recording Rock Bottom, sang back-up vocals on several songs and performed one of her own songs, \\"Mind of a Child\\". Most of the band had collaborated with Wyatt prior to Rock Bottom; for example, Hopper was also in Soft Machine, and Wyatt and Tippetts had both been members of Centipede. Wyatt and most of the band members appeared in a promo photo, which was used for the concert poster and on the cover of NME. In the photo, the band members sat in wheelchairs for the photo in a display of \\"wheelchair solidarity\\" with Wyatt. Mason was superimposed into the image later. Commenting on the photo years later, Wyatt told Uncut it was \\"a real laugh doing it\\", but said that the NME received complaints from readers who felt the image was \\"a bit tasteless\\". Wyatt said he couldn't understand those who objected to the image: \\"I thought it was a very good idea. Especially on steps‚Äîwheelchairs on steps are dangerous, they're rubbish! There are people in wheelchairs and with other disabilities, who I know from letters and so on, who were very encouraged that far from my career as a musician being over, it actually got much stronger in terms of my contribution to it.\\" The concert announcement in the NME prominently mentioned that the show would feature Oldfield, who was already one of the best-selling British musicians of the 1970s with the multi-platinum Tubular Bells and its followup Hergest Ridge released the month before the concert.  Performance  Exterior of the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane in 2008 The concert was scheduled to begin at , and a crowd of hippies gathered outside the venue nearly two hours prior. John Peel, the BBC Radio 1 disc jockey, served as the evening's master of ceremonies wearing a glam rock-style costume. Opening acts Ivor Cutler and Phyllis King performed songs and spoken word poetry. Peel, who had considered Wyatt his favorite drummer prior to the accident, delivered an introduction and concluded by announcing: \\"And now, for Robert Wyatt of Twickenham... opportunity knocks!\\" Wyatt entered the stage and received a standing ovation. Positioned between a mixer and keyboards, he said that the mixer was not actually plugged in but would give him \\"something to do with my hands.\\" He said he would \\"probably not\\" play the keyboards, since he had not done so in rehearsal, but remarked that they \\"look good\\" anyway. The set list opened with two covers of songs composed by Hopper: \\"Dedicated to You But You Weren't Listening\\", from the Soft Machine album Volume Two, and \\"Memories\\", a song from The Wilde Flowers, Wyatt and Hopper's first band together. Wyatt's anxiety was evident during these first two songs; critics later described the performances of Hopper's songs as \\"good-naturedly rickety\\" and \\"fractured\\". The band then performed the songs from Rock Bottom, starting with \\"Sea Song\\". Over the course of the concert, Wyatt's band performed Rock Bottom in its entirety, albeit not in the same order as the album. The more confident performance of Rock Bottom turned a corner from the unsteady playing in the first two songs. Wyatt, in particular, performed with noticeably greater confidence after the audience applauded in recognition at the opening lines of \\"Sea Song\\". During \\"Sea Song\\", the band launched into extended group improvisations not present on the studio version, which Simon Reynolds compared to an \\"Anglicised Bitches Brew,\\" and ends the song with improvisatory scat singing, which Reynolds described as his \\"falsetto spiral[ling] up into ecstatic scat acrobatics, as though his spirit is trying to escape his shattered body.\\" Will Hermes likened Wyatt's scat vocals throughout the concert to the sound of \\"a choirboy at an acid test.\\" The performance of the next song, \\"A Last Straw\\", has a noticeable swing rhythm and, according to NPR's Andy Battaglia, is \\"rawer [and] more raucous\\" than the studio version. Wyatt again sang vocal improvisations and scat vocals. Oldfield made a brief, inconspicuous appearance onstage to play synthesizer toward the end of \\"A Last Straw\\". On \\"Little Red Riding Hood Hit the Road\\", Frith played rhythm guitar and Feza soloed on trumpet. Feza's soloing was lauded by critics; Mike Barnes of The Wire said Feza \\"lets rip some extraordinary note-streams in his trademark hard, bright sound.\\" According to Barnes, Windo's tenor saxophone solo on \\"Alife\\" evoked the German free jazz saxophonist Peter Br√∂tzmann. The first set ends with \\"Alifib\\", which Reynolds called a \\"gorgeous quilt of shimmering keys and glistening guitar\\". After \\"Alifib\\", Julie Tippetts performed an interlude of her own music: the ballad \\"Mind of a Child\\", \\"Behind the Eyes\\", and a freeform flute solo. Both songs come from her 1974 album Sunset Glow, which Wyatt considered to be a \\"companion piece\\" to Rock Bottom. \\"Mind of a Child\\" is the only song by Tippetts included on the official live album; Barnes speculated that the others were presumably deleted to fit a CD- length total runtime. Critical assessment of Tippetts' segment of the show was decidedly mixed. The NME said she \\"rather derailed things\\" with her \\"uncertain\\" piano playing and the \\"lugubriousness\\" of her songs, despite her \\"compelling\\" voice. Barnes called \\"Mind of a Child\\" a \\"poignant\\" song and lamented the omission of Tippetts' other music from the album, but conceded her \\"two songs together did effectively drive a wedge through the set.\\" Tippetts' songs were followed by a noisy free improvisation with Wyatt, Feza and Windo, also omitted from the album. The second set began with the final song on Rock Bottom, \\"Little Red Robin Hood Hit the Road\\". In \\"Calyx\\", a cover of Hatfield and the North, Wyatt sang nonverbal vocals in place of the original lyrics.  Concert reception  The live performance was met with enthusiastic reviews. In the Daily Telegraph, Maurice Rosenbaum wrote t]here was more genuine originality in Robert Wyatt's concert at Drury Lane Theatre last night than I have heard for a long time. It is a variety of pop music for which there is no neat pigeonhole but it is as creative and satisfying in its own way as the music of the so-called 'avant-garde.'\\" Charles Shaar Murray in NME praised Wyatt's vocals as \\"better than ever\\" and concluded g]enerally, the show veered from the sublime to the ridiculous, with the sublime firmly in the lead.\\" Although Murray disliked Tippet's contributions, he highlighted the \\"thoroughly berserk version\\" of \\"I'm a Believer\\" as the show's climax, particularly the \\"singularly dirty rhythm guitar\\" played by Oldfield. In a profile of Mike Oldfield by Karl Dallas for the British music magazine Let It Rock, Dallas praised Oldfield and Frith's guitar playing at the show, writing \\"you could feel the thrill run through the theatre\\" when Oldfield came onstage.  Subsequent live performances  Shortly after the concert at Drury Lane, the NME asked Wyatt if he planned to perform again soon. Wyatt replied: Wyatt in 2013. To date, the Drury Lane performance remains Wyatt's only headlining concert as a solo artist. In the years since, Wyatt has never again performed live as a headliner, making the Drury Lane show the only concert in his over four-decade solo career. He has rarely performed live at all after Drury Lane, even as a guest of other musicians, in part because he developed intense stage fright. His fear of performing has even caused recurring nightmares in which Miles Davis laughs at Wyatt from offstage. Nevertheless, Wyatt has made some live guest appearances alongside other artists. Wyatt performed onstage in the late 1970s with Henry Cow at concerts in London, Paris, and Rome, documented on the 1976 live double album Concerts. In 1981, he appeared with The Raincoats at London's Albany Theatre. Finally, at the Wyatt-curated Meltdown festival in 2001, he sang the first several verses of Pink Floyd's \\"Comfortably Numb\\" with David Gilmour‚Äîalbeit from the front of the stage, not actually appearing onstage‚Äîand sang a cappella with his wife Alfie at the conclusion of the festival, crouching in a stage balcony to avoid being seen by the audience. In 2005, Wyatt told Mojo that he would have loved to tour with the Drury Lane band but that Mason, Oldfield, and Frith made that a logistical impossibility. In an interview the same year with Record Collector magazine, Wyatt expressed some regrets about never playing live again, but noted his satisfaction with the Drury Lane performance: Wyatt told his biographer Marcus O'Dair \\"I get a nice warm feeling from [the Drury Lane] record, I really do,\\" and said he was \\"surprised at the elastic energy that sustains the whole thing.\\" When asked about the possibility of future shows once more in 2015, Wyatt told Q it would be \\"undoable... appalling, just the thought of it.\\"  Bootlegs  The first official recording of any music from the concert was the live version of \\"Calyx\\" on the first disc of Eps, a Wyatt box set released by Thirsty Ear Recordings in 1999. Prior to the official release of a Drury Lane live album in 2005, the concert was widely bootlegged. The first bootleg recording of the concert, titled Las Vegas Fandango, was issued on vinyl in 1981. (Note: although Disco Robert Wyatt is an unofficial fansite, Wyatt biographer Marcus O'Dair considers it to be an authoritative, \\"exhaustive\\" source on Wyatt's discography; see .) Bootlegs of the concert were common among aficionados; Derek Hammond of Record Collector speculated that the concert \\"must be one of the most bootlegged gigs ever,\\" and several reviews of the official release alluded to the widespread distribution of bootlegged copies. AllMusic even reviewed Sea Song, a bootleg CD released sometime before 2005 identical to the version released as Las Vegas Fandango. According to AllMusic's Ted Mills, \\"the sound quality [on Sea Song] is dreadful, but this is a historically important document of a one-time-only event.\\" Mills recalled the live version of \\"Calyx\\" that appeared on Eps was \\"in pristine condition, suggesting that a quality recording does exist,\\" but he speculated Wyatt sees no reason to release any more from this concert.\\" At least four distinct bootleg versions of the concert circulated before the official release. Even after the official release of a concert recording in 2005, one previously unearthed bootleg emerged; according to Disco Robert Wyatt‚Äîa French fansite devoted to Wyatt‚Äîa bootleg titled Robert Wyatt With Friends in Concert began circulating online in MP3 format circa 2010. The newly unearthed bootleg contains material omitted from the official release, and the quality of the recording is described as generally better than the official version, aside from a minor flaw in \\"Calyx\\" and a fade-out in \\"I'm a Believer\\" before the band finished playing.  Live album   2005 release  Almost two decades after the concert, Wyatt revealed to psychedelic rock magazine Ptolemaic Terrascope that Virgin Records had \\"sneakily recorded [the show] and then put the cost of recording onto my bill, which I thought was a bit nasty.\\" Wyatt later told the French magazine Rock & Folk that a complete tape of the concert survived but was damaged, with perhaps only two or three songs that were salvageable. In 2005, Hannibal Records‚Äîa subsidiary of the then-independent record label Rykodisc‚Äîreleased the live album Theatre Royal Drury Lane 8th September 1974, the first officially released recording of the concert. Wyatt dedicated the album to Peel, Feza, and Windo‚Äîthe three concert participants who had died before the release of the live album. The sound quality of the album drops drastically after the first set ends because portions of the original high-quality recording have been lost. The CD packaging includes a note about this on the back cover: In an interview, Wyatt said that some of the earlier bootlegs \\"simply shouldn't have\\" been released due to their poor sound quality, comparing them to fans searching through Bob Dylan's garbage. Still, he said he \\"didn't want mislead people into thinking that [the 2005 official release] was a new or perfectly formed recording.\\"  Reception  Drury Lane received generally favorable reviews. Writing for The Observer, Simon Reynolds gave the album a perfect five stars, giving praise to the \\"supergroup\\" Wyatt assembled. Reynolds concluded that it was a]larming but true: one of the best releases of 2005 was recorded 31 years ago,\\" and he later named the album among his favorite reissues of the year in The Wires \\"Rewind 2005\\" issue. In AllMusic, Thom Jurek praised the quality of the lineup, with Wyatt in \\"excellent form\\" and the band, though \\"a bit ragged in places, are nonetheless tight and full of fire.\\" According to Jurek, the album is a \\"tribute\\" to Wyatt, a \\"fine\\" gathering of Canterbury scene musicians and \\"as close to an essential document of 1970s experimental/prog as one is likely to find.\\" Will Hermes wrote in Spin that, compared to the \\"claustrophobic poignancy\\" of Wyatt's studio recordings, \\"this polished live disc lights up a world where weirdo jazz-rock and the Monkees grope in the dark.\\" David Marchese, writing for PopMatters, called the album \\"both a welcome addition to Wyatt's catalogue and an indispensable document for anyone interested in that rare breed of musician who is forever alive to the possibility of new opportunities and forever blind to the existence of obstacles.\\" Marchese said the performances of songs from Rock Bottom \\"match, if not better, their studio versions,\\" with the other songs matching that \\"high level,\\" especially the \\"rousing\\" and \\"epic\\" take on \\"I'm a Believer\\". Mike Barnes at The Wire wrote \\"those who have only heard the recorded songs‚Äîlush, childlike and dreamy, but with disquiet seeping in at their edges‚Äîmight be surprised how strong they sound live.\\" He praised Wyatt's choice of collaborators as a band of \\"exceptional musicians, who would otherwise probably not have been heard by a rock audience.\\" According to Barnes, the sound quality is a major improvement over the bootlegged versions in circulation, though he notes the sound becomes \\"ragged\\" by the show's end. Barnes also quibbled with the omission of the free improvisation segment in the middle of the concert, cuts that he felt were made to leave time for the \\"pointless and irritating\\" hidden track. The album received favorable notice in the French press, with positive reviews in Le Monde and Muziq (reviewed by the critic ); the latter publication included the album on its 2008 list of \\"indispensable\\" live albums. The only conclusively negative review came from The Guardians Dave Simpson, who called it an \\"eerie 1970s curio\\" and gave it two out of five stars. While Simpson found \\"some wonderful music here that showcases Wyatt's voice,\\" he wrote that \\"time has not been kind\\" to some of the more experimental and jazz-oriented music at the concert, summing it up as \\"a period piece aimed at the most devoted fans.\\" 2008 reissue Domino Recording Company reissued Robert Wyatt's entire album discography in 2008, including Drury Lane. Released on 28 October, Drury Lane was made available in both CD and LP format, marking the live album's first official pressing on vinyl. Later reviews of the live album remained generally positive but less enthusiastic overall. In the Irish music magazine Analogue, Ciar√°n Gaynor gave Theatre Royal Drury Lane a 90%, tying it with Rock Bottom for the highest score in Wyatt's discography. In The Wire, David Stubbs said Wyatt \\"can't achieve [Rock Bottom]'s full effect in a live setting, but the love in which this good and great musician is wreathed from colleagues, audience, and comp√®re John Peel alike, is warmly palpable.\\" David Cavanagh of Uncut said the concert \\"skirts the outermost musical avant-garde at times, and gets pretty sloppy at others,\\" but noted that the \\"unexpected arrangements\\" of songs from Rock Bottom made the album \\"fascinating\\" on the whole. Douglas Wolk at Pitchfork gave the reissue a low score‚Äîonly 4.4 out of 10. While Wolk called the band \\"fantastic,\\" he said r]egrettably, the sound quality is indifferent, and the performances don't particularly improve on their studio equivalents.

During the war it served in Home Defence and in Middle East Command. It continued to serve in the postwar TA until 1955. Origin During the period of international tension following the Munich Crisis of 1938, the War Office rapidly increased the size of Britain's anti-aircraft (AA) defences manned by part-time members of the Territorial Army (TA). A new regiment based in Glasgow was raised and commanded by Brevet Colonel John Muirhead, DSO, MC, TD, a Glasgow solicitor who had served in the signal service on the Western Front during World War I and later commanded Glasgow University Officers Training Corps (an artillery battery).Obituary, The Times, 19 February 1972.Who was Who 1917‚Äì1980.Army List, various dates.Muirhead at Generals of WWII. 74th AA Brigade consisted of 230, 231 and 232 AA Batteries and the first officers' commissions (its official date of creation) were dated 1 November 1938. On 1 January 1939, in common with all other AA brigades, it was redesignated a regiment, and in September 1939 it gained its subtitle, becoming 74th (City of Glasgow) AA Regiment. Its regimental headquarters (RHQ) was at 34 West George Street, Glasgow.Frederick, pp. 755, 774.Litchfield, p. 290. It formed part of 42nd Anti-Aircraft Brigade, newly-formed to take responsibility for the AA defence of Glasgow and the Clyde estuary.Routledge, Table LX, p. 378.AA Command 3 September 1939 at Patriot Files. Mobilisation In June 1939, as the international situation worsened, a partial mobilisation of TA units was begun in a process known as 'couverture', whereby each AA unit did a month's tour of duty in rotation to man selected AA and searchlight positions. On 24 August, ahead of the declaration of war, Anti-Aircraft Command was fully mobilised at its war stations.Routledge, pp. 65‚Äì6, 371. On 1 June 1940 those AA regiments like 74th equipped with 3-inch or the newer 3.7-inch guns were termed Heavy Anti-Aircraft (HAA) to distinguish them from the new Light Anti-Aircraft (LAA) units being formed. Although Glasgow like other British cities was soon to be heavily bombed during The Blitz, there as an urgent need to reinforce the AA defences of the British bases in Egypt after the entry of Italy into the war. 74th HAARegiment sailed round the Cape of Good Hope and landed at Port Tewfik in Egypt on 16 November 1940.Farndale, p. 130.Playfair, Vol I, pp. 213‚Äì4.Routledge, pp. 127‚Äì8. Middle East A 3.7-inch HAA gun in North Africa, 1941. On 8 January 1941 the regiment came under the command of 2 AA Bde, newly arrived in Cairo. By the end of January 1941 the regiment under Col Muirhead was stationed in the Suez Canal Line of Communication Area under British Troops Egypt, with 230 HAA Bty under Major L.C. Dunn detached to Port Said and 232 HAA Bty defending the Canal and Alexandria.Farndale, p. 119.Joslen, p. 479.Routledge, p. 129; Table XIX, p. 141.2 AA Bde War Diary, Middle East, 1941, The National Archives (TNA), Kew, file WO 169/1560. After the fall of Greece and Crete in the first part of 1941, bombers of the Luftwaffe 's Fliegerkorps X based there began raids against shipping at Suez, British bases in the Canal Zone, and the Canal itself (390 sorties in 34 night attacks from July to October). The naval base at Alexandria was also raided (274 sorties from mid-June to October). The AA defences were still comparatively weak and radar cover was poor, but the raids did not cause serious disruption.Playfair, Vol II, pp. 298‚Äì301. 74th HAA Regiment remained under 2 AA Bde during this period, with all 24 of its 3.7-inch guns deployed to defend Port Said and Port Fuad. Colonel Muirhead was promoted to command 2 AA Bde on 23 August 1941 but on 3 September he was transferred to command 4 AA Bde in Tobruk.Farndale, Annex J.Joslen, p. 482.Routledge, Table XXII, p. 143. The regiment remained with Middle East Forces (MEF) in Egypt until the summer of 1942, when it moved to Ninth Army in Palestine.Joslen, pp. 484‚Äì5.Joslen, p. 487. Here it came under the command of 20 AA Bde, which was responsible for the defence of ports and oil facilities at Haifa, Beirut, Lydda, Tripoli and for Cyprus. In January 1943 the regiment had 230 and 232 HAA Btys (16 x 3.7-inch guns) and 103 LAA Bty of 26th LAA Rgt (4 x 20 mm guns and 15 x Bofors 40 mm guns) under command, while 231 HAA Bty was detached under the command of 89th HAA Rgt advancing through Libya behind Eighth Army.Routledge, Table XXIV, p. 162. On 1 April 1943, 231 HAA Bty transferred to 88th HAA Rgt and was replaced by 683 HAA Bty; this was the last new HAA battery formed during the war.Frederick, p.763. In May 1943 the regiment was stationed on Cyprus, but at the end of the year it was back in Palestine under 1 AA Bde.Routledge, Table XXV, p. 164.Routledge, Table XXVI, p. 165. During 1944 the Eastern Mediterranean AA Group began to be run down: the air threat had diminished and the need to provide manpower for combat tasks elsewhere had become urgent. Surplus AA units in the region began to be disbanded. In June 1944, 74th HAA Rgt was in Alexandria under 17 AA Bde, but the following month that brigade was disbanded and 74th (City of Glasgow) HAA Regiment with 230, 232 and 683 HAA Btys passed into suspended animation on 14 November.Routledge, pp. 160‚Äì1. Postwar When the TA was reconstituted on 1 January 1947, the regiment reformed as 474 (City of Glasgow) HAA Regiment, with its RHQ at Yorkhill Parade drill hall, Glasgow. It formed part of 77 AA Bde (the wartime 51 AA Bde, based in Glasgow).Frederick, pp. 1017.474‚Äì519 Rgts RA at British Army 1945 onwards.Farndale, Annex M.Litchfield, Appendix 5.Watson, TA 1947. On 2 May 1950 the regiment absorbed 592 (Glasgow) LAA Rgt, without change of title or role. AA Command was disbanded on 10 March 1955 and there were wholesale amalgamations amongst its units. 474 HAA Regiment was amalgamated with the remaining units of 77 AA Bde, 483 (Blythswood) HAA Rgt and 591 (Cameronians) LAA Rgt. The combined unit was designated 445 (Cameronians) LAA Rgt, in which 474 Rgt formed R (Glasgow) Bty.Frederick, p. 1014, 1025.

It was organized by emperor Nero in 60/61 AD. How successful the expedition was is disputed by historians. History Emperor Nero around 61 AD sent a small group of praetorian guards to explore the sources of the Nile River in Africa. He did this in order to obtain information for a possible conquest of Ethiopia, as was called Equatorial Africa (and everything south of Egypt) by the Romans. The Roman legionaries navigating the Nile from southern Egypt initially reached the city of Mero√´ and later moved to the Sudd, where they found huge difficulties in going further. Seneca wrote about this exploration and detailed that the sources were from a big lake in central Africa, south of the swamp region now called \\"the Sudd\\" in Southern Sudan. But other Roman historians, such as Pliny, suggest that the exploration was done in order to prepare a conquest of Ethiopia by Nero's legions. However the death of Nero prevented further explorations of the Nile as well as a possible Roman conquest south of their Roman Egypt https://books.google.com/books?id=8OgVKbssrT0C&pg;=PT364&lpg;=PT364&dq;=nero+expedition+to+ethiopia&source;=bl&ots;=Vzxhycd8WV&sig;=Fvw5DFR8dcPV0z5W9YNkwMD6bpI&hl;=en&sa;=X&ved;=0ahUKEwjwy4iniL_QAhUH7GMKHSidA0cQ6AEISDAG#v=onepage&q;=nero%20expedition%20to%20ethiopia&f;=false Buckley & Dinter: A Companion to the Neronian Age]. Some historians suggest that the Roman legionaries of Nero probably reached the Murchison Falls in Uganda (but there it is a major controversy about this very difficult achievement).Vantini, Giovanni (2004). Da dove viene l'acqua del Nilo? Ricerche e risposte di antichi scienziati. Piroga: volume 8, numero 23, pgs. 88-91 (url=http://www.volint.it/piroga/piroga10/nilo.pdf ) Seneca & Pliny accounts Accounts are found in Seneca the Younger (VI.8.3) and Pliny (Natural History, VI.XXXV, p. 181-187): The Roman legionaries navigating the Nile from southern Egypt initially reached the city of Meroe and later moved to the Sudd, where they found huge difficulties to go further. The small group of praetorian guards related -when back to Nero- that ‚ÄòWe personally saw two rocks from which an immense quantity of water issued.‚Äô, according to Seneca. It is noteworthy to pinpoint that some historians -like Giovanni Vannini- argue that this place is the Murchison Falls in northern Uganda, meaning that the Romans reached equatorial Africa. It is noteworthy to pinpoint that the Nero expedition from Roman Egypt reached the area of Jinja in Uganda, according to historian Vannini: he believes that the legionaries were able to reach lake Victoria, based on the description of their discovery of huge water falls. Vannini noted that in the Seneca interview to the legionaries, they described a Nile falls that is very similar to the Murchison Falls. Seneca De Nubibus in the book Naturales Quaestiones, that gave details about a Nero expedition to the caput mundi investigandum (to explore the top of the world) in 61/62 AD. In this book he explained to have reported what two legionaries told him about their discovery of the caput Nili (the origin of the Nile river): \\"ibi vidimus duas petras, ex quibus ingens vis fluminis excidebat‚Ä¶ex magno terrarum lacu ascendere‚Ä¶\\" (We saw two huge rocks, from which the power of the [Nile] river went out in a powerful way.....[The Nile river] comes from a very huge lake of the [African] lands). Furthermore Seneca wrote that the legionaries told him that the water of the Nile river, that jumped through two huge rocks, was coming from a very big lake inside the African lands. This lake‚Äîaccording to Vannini and others‚Äîcould only be the Victoria lake, the biggest African lake. The only river that goes out from this huge lake is the White Nile (named \\"Victoria Nile\\" when exits the lake), that in Jinja (Uganda) goes north toward the \\"Murchison Falls\\". Indeed the \\"Murchison Falls\\" is a waterfall on the Nile that breaks the Victoria Nile, which flows across northern Uganda from Lake Victoria to Lake Kyoga and then to the north end of Lake Albert in the western branch of the East African Rift. At the top of Murchison Falls, the Nile forces its way through a gap in the rocks only 7 metres (23 ft) wide, and tumbles 43 metres (141 ft), then flows westward into Lake Albert. The outlet of Lake Victoria sends around 300 cubic meters per second (11,000 ft¬≥/s) of water over the falls, squeezed into a gorge less than ten metres (30 ft) wide: these falls are similar in shape to the ones described by the legionaries. Indeed Vantini wrote in the magazine \\"Nigrizia\\" in 1996 that the legionaries did an explorative travel of more than 5,000 km from Meroe to Uganda: a remarkable achievement done using small boats in order to bypass the Sudd, a huge swamp full of dangerous Nile crocodiles. Furthermore, another historian (David Braund) wrote in 2015 that probably Nero's expedition to the Nile's sources opened a new route toward the Indian Ocean, bypassing the dangers of piracy in the Red Sea area while allowing future Roman commerce toward India and Azania David Braund: Nero‚Äôs Nubian Nile, India and the rubrum mare (Tacitus, Annals 2.61).

In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the firms of Flint, Bixby & Company, J. Bixby & Company, J. W. Bixby & Company, the Alamitos Land Company, and the Bixby Land Company controlled large swathes of California real estate, much of it derived from Mexican land grants. At various times their holdings included Rancho Los Cerritos, Rancho Los Alamitos, half of Rancho San Justo, and part of Rancho Palos Verdes together with other property in San Benito, Santa Barbara, and Los Angeles counties. Parts of the towns of Long Beach, Bellflower, Paramount, Signal Hill, Lakewood, and Los Alamitos emerged from former Bixby-held lands. History The history of the land companies begins with the brothers Benjamin and Thomas Flint and their cousin Llewellyn Bixby, who left Maine for California in 1851, attracted by the Gold Rush. They turned from mining to ranching, and in 1852-53, the three cousins drove more than 2000 sheep from Ohio to California, the first step in what would become a highly successful ranching enterprise. Together with Llewellyn's brother Jotham they went into business as Flint, Bixby & Company. In 1855, Flint, Bixby bought the 34,000-acre Rancho San Justo near what is now the town of Hollister in partnership with rancher William Welles Hollister. In 1858, the company bought the Hero-Huero Ranch near Paso Robles, and by 1859, they were running some 20,000 sheep on the ranches. The partnership with Hollister dissolved in 1861, with Flint, Bixby ultimately ending up with all the Rancho San Justo land east of the San Benito River. The business especially prospered as a result of the high demand for meat and wool during the Civil War. In 1864, Flint, Bixby started acquiring land in southern California, beginning with the Rancho San Joaquin, Rancho Lomas de Santiago, and a section of Rancho Santiago de Santa Ana, with James Irvine (1827‚Äì1886) as a silent partner. These three contiguous parcels totaled over 100,000 acres. In the 1870s, Flint, Bixby sold these properties to Irvine. In 1866 Flint, Bixby expanded further, buying the 27,000-acre Rancho Los Cerritos. Jotham was the manager of Rancho Los Cerritos and later bought a half interest in it through his own firm, J. Bixby & Company. By the 1870s, sheep ranching was in decline in southern California and Jotham Bixby began to sell off this land for development. In the 1870s, another cousin, John William Bixby, bought a portion of Rancho Canon de Santa Ana and began leasing part of Rancho Los Alamitos. Sometime between 1881 and 1883 he bought Rancho Los Alamitos with two partners, J. Bixby & Company and Isaias W. Hellman, founder of the Farmers and Merchants Bank of Los Angeles. This three-way partnership operated as J. W. Bixby & Company. John managed the 29,000-acre ranch and lived there with his family. John died suddenly of appendicitis in 1887, as a result of which Rancho Los Alamitos was divided into thirds in 1891. J. Bixby & Company got the acreage that adjoined Rancho Los Cerritos, and this later became the first holdings of yet another company, the Bixby Land Company, founded in 1896. Part of the Bixby Land Company property was a sugar beet farm that was later redeveloped into the city of Los Alamitos. The banker Hellman received a southeastern section that became a housing development, and John's family kept the rest. When John died, he and his partners had already been planning to dissolve their partnership. While he was still alive, a new family-owned company was formed, the Alamitos Land Company, with an eye to developing a southwest part of the rancho property where it adjoined the city of Long Beach. The Alamitos Land Company eventually developed an area that included Signal Hill. The company still exists and is owned mainly by Bixby and Hellman descendants.

Walter Cheesman (1838 ‚Äì 1907) was an American businessman who was involved in railroad, finance, real estate, and water industries. After beginning his career in New York and Chicago, he lived in Denver, where Cheesman Dam, Cheesman Reservoir, and Cheesman Park are named for him. Early years Walter Scott Cheesman was born at Hempstead Harbor, New York on June 27, 1838. He was a member of a prominent Long Island family and attended public high school. He received private tutoring before entering into family businesses, including banking and mercantile. Career Cheesman moved to Chicago in 1854 to start a pharmacy business with William Henry and Edward Talbot Cheesman, his older brothers. His brothers came to Denver in 1859 and opened a pharmacy store, but they were not very successful, so Cheesman came to Denver in 1861 and took over the business. He added bottled water and liquor to the store's merchandise. The town's first drug store was located near the corner of Fifteenth and Blake. He operated the business until 1874, when he sold it. In 1868 he, John Evans and David H. Moffat began work to build the Denver Pacific Railroad to Cheyenne, Wyoming. Cheesman was president of the railroad for several years. He planned for the construction of the Union Station, and he was active in the building of the Denver Boulder Valley Railroad and South Park Road. The railroad helped Denver become a major city. He also was a director of the Denver, Northern, and Pacific Railway Company. View from the top of the Colorado State Capitol, facing northwest looking down 16th St. The intersection of 16th and Broadway is in the foreground. The domed building on the left side is the County Courthouse, demolished in 1933. Cheesman determined the location of the court house by purchasing the land and selling it to the city for an affordable price. The court house otherwise would have been located further from the center of the city. He was an organizer of the International Trust Company and served as a member of its executive committee for more than 15 years, and he was a member of the Denver Real Estate Exchange. He bought real estate throughout the years, established financial institutions, and helped develop mines. Cheesman Dam and Cheesman Reservoir In 1870, he became a principal in a company to provide water to Denver and served on the board of directors. Two water plants were consolidated into the monopolistic Denver Union Water Company in 1894, and he, David Moffat, and Thomas Hayden owned the controlling stock. Cheesman became president of the company that grew to a $25 million organization. He built dams, reservoirs, and filtration and distribution systems. Cheesman Dam and Cheesman Reservoir are named for him. Personal life He was president for years of the Colorado Humane Society, with the goal to end cruelty to children and animals. He was known to come to the aid of animals or children in need, even venturing out in bad weather after he had become a multi- millionaire to rescue and provide shelter to a horse that was staked out in an open field. Cheesman also supported the Juvenile Improvement Society, founded by Judge Ben Lindsey. Cheesman Memorial, Cheesman Park, Denver He lived in the Walter Dunning mansion at 1200 Pennsylvania Street in Denver for a short period of time before his death in 1907.

She carried both passengers and freight. In her early career she was a ferry in Panama and then ran between Panama and San Francisco. Later she began coastal runs between Sand Diego and San Francisco. Her last route was Port Townsend, Washington to Alaska. Today she is more notable for her disasters than her routine voyages. Ancon Rock in Icy Strait, Alaska is the site of her 1886 grounding. Her final wreck, in 1889 in Naha Bay, near Loring, Alaska was commemorated by Albert Bierstadt. His painting, \\"Wreck of the 'Ancon' in Loring Bay, Alaska\\" now hangs in the Museum of Fine Art in Boston.  Construction and Panama service (1867‚Äì1872)  Ancon was originally built as a double-ended ferry for service in Panama for the Pacific Mail Steamship Company. She replaced the company's Taboga, which was retired. Ancon was built in the Hunter's Point neighborhood of San Francisco and launched on October 12, 1867. Her displacement was 654 tons. She was propelled by a coal-fired steam engine that generated . Sea trials with invited guests aboard were held on April 29, 1868. She was towed to Panama by the company's Golden City and arrived at Panama Bay on June 22, 1868. The Pacific Mail Steamship Company had a hub at the western end of the Panama Railroad. Its ocean-going steamships carried passengers and freight from California to Panama, where they could cross the isthmus by rail. From here steamships could take them to New York or other Atlantic ports. Ancon, which drew only of water at the time, was used as a lighter to bring people and goods ashore from the deep-draft ocean-going ships when they arrived at Panama.  Rebuilding and Central American service (1872‚Äì1875)  Ancon proved too large for her role in Panama and was brought back to San Francisco in late 1872. She was rebuilt as an ocean-going ship. Her hull was reused, but she was given much greater capacity for passengers, cargo, and coal. Her displacement was almost tripled to 1,541 tons, and her engine was upgraded to . Her engine had a cylinder with a stroke. Her boilers were coal-fired and she would take on as much as 400 tons of coal when refueling. Ancons staterooms had two or three berths, and she could carry 135 cabin passengers and a similar number in steerage. By mid-1873 Ancon was sailing from San Francisco to Panama and back with many stops in between. A single one-way trip took five weeks and involved 19 port calls. Her last trip in 1874 was notable for its light load. She left Panama with only 26 cabin and 15 steerage passengers, and only 32 sacks of mail. The opening of the transcontinental railroad link in the United States in 1869 much reduced demand for coast-to-coast steamship travel via Panama. Ancon ran only one more round trip to Panama, departing San Francisco on December 24, 1874 She returned March 11, 1875. On this final trip she carried 7,982 sacks of coffee beans to San Francisco. In January 1875, the Goodall, Nelson, and Perkins Steamship Company acquired the competing San Francisco to San Diego routes, ships, and port facilities of the Pacific Mail Steamship Company, including Ancon. Goodall, Nelson, and Perkins was reorganized as the Pacific Coast Steamship Company in 1876.  California Service (1875‚Äì1887)  From mid-1875 to 1887 Ancon sailed between San Francisco and San Diego, with several stops in between. She made three round trips per month. A one-way fare from San Pedro to San Francisco with a cabin was $15, and $10 for steerage. In late 1878 she was also periodically assigned to the San Francisco‚ÄìPortland line with a single stop at Astoria. Starting in 1885, Ancon was periodically assigned to shuttle between San Francisco and Eureka. Ancons cargo was as diverse as the California economy. She shipped wool, wheat, honey, hides, household goods (including a piano), cranberries, cheese, lemons, oranges, shingles, doors, castings, guns, leather, whiskey, horses, fish, seal skins, marble, machinery, sweet potatoes, olives, chickens, and sacks of mail.  Grounding of Ventura  During the evening of April 20, 1875 the Pacific Mail Steamship Company vessel Ventura ran onto a rock off Point Sur in a dense fog. A large gash in the hull suggested that the ship would likely be totally destroyed, so the 225 passengers were landed on the beach. The steamer Santa Cruz took the passengers off the beach and delivered them to nearby Monterey. Ancon was sent from San Francisco to Monterey on April 22 to pick up the stranded passengers and take them on to San Pedro. The rescue effort was successful, and no lives were lost.  Colission with Phil Sheridan  During a voyage from Astoria to San Francisco, on the night of September 15, 1878 Ancon rammed the sailing vessel Phil Sheridan in the fog about 15 miles off the mouth of the Umpqua River. Phil Sheridan was a two-masted schooner of 158 tons displacement. The schooner rolled onto her beam ends and was assumed to be sinking. The passengers and crew were taken aboard Ancon. Ten days later Phil Sheridan was found still floating on her beam ends near Coos Bay and attempts were made to salvage her.  Alaska service (1884‚Äì1889)  Cruising to Alaska became popular in the 1880s, so the Pacific Coast Steamship Company began to use the ship for \\"excursion\\" cruises in the summer. Ancon made three round trips to Alaska in 1884 under the command of Captain James Carroll. In March 1887, the Pacific Coast Steamship Company reassigned Ancon permanently to the Alaska trade. For the remainder of her career, she would travel between Port Townsend, Victoria, Nanaimo, Juneau, Fort Wrangell, Sitka and a variety of smaller ports and settlements, some no more than a salmon cannery. She also made occasional trips to Portland, Tacoma, and Seattle during this period, often in conjunction with loading or discharging a particular cargo. She alternated trips to Alaska with the company's steamers Idaho and George W. Elder, completing a roundtrip from Port Townsend in about a month. Her trips were more frequent in summer due to tourist demand for cruises in the good weather. She sailed on the Inside Passage between Puget Sound and Alaska, not the open ocean. She was considered a comfortable vessel, and carried such notables as Governor of the District of Alaska Alfred P. Swineford, U.S. Supreme Court Justice Stephen J. Field and Colorado Governor Alva Adams. Her steerage accommodations were less comfortable and were often used to transport miners and cannery workers to and from their seasonal work. On one voyage, Ancon sailed back from Sitka with 30 Chinese cannery laborers aboard. When she reached Port Townsend on October 15, 1888 the Collector of Customs refused to allow the Chinese off the ship. He asserted that because the ship sailed through British waters along the coast of British Columbia, the Chinese were arriving from a foreign country which was not allowed under the Chinese Exclusion Act. The matter was resolved in court when a judge ruled on October 23, 1888 that American-flagged ships were defined by law to be American territory. In sailing from Alaska to Washington on Ancon, they had, as a matter of law, always been in the United States and thus were not immigrants subject to the Chinese Exclusion Act. The Chinese were finally allowed off the ship. Ancons main cargo from Alaska was canned and salted salmon. She sometimes carried as much as 400 tons on a single voyage. Her cargoes for the northbound trip were more varied. They included supplies for the canneries, but also mining equipment for the Treadwell Mine and other mining operations in Southeast Alaska. One cargo was notable for cultural reasons. In 1887, she carried Rev. William Duncan, a sawmill, and 50 tons of supplies to Metlakata on Annette Island, helping establish the Tsimshian people in Alaska. In addition to her legal freight, Ancon was thought by some to be engaged in smuggling. Under the laws of the District of Alaska, it was illegal to import alcohol. Nonetheless, according to one newspaper, after the ship arrived in Alaska, \\"for twenty-fours hours there was simply the deuce to pay with drunken fishermen and crazed people of both sexes.\\" In 1887 U.S. Customs authorities confiscated $2,000 worth of gin, labeled as mineral water, from Ancon. The ship and her captain were also accused of smuggling opium from suppliers in Victoria, British Columbia to Alaska, where it was transferred to whaling ships that brought it back to West Coast ports in the United States.  Grounding in Icy Strait (1886)  At 9:57 P.M. on September 13, 1886, Ancon was cruising past Point Gustavus in Icy Strait, heading into Glacier Bay. Most of her 14 passengers were asleep in their staterooms. She approached to within a half-mile of the point and grounded hard on an uncharted rock. Her hull was pierced and she began flooding. The ship listed to one side while lifeboats were readied for launch. Three hours later, at 1 A.M. on September 14, the tide had risen sufficiently for Ancon to float free. The water in the hold had by then extinguished the boiler fires, however, so both the pumps and engines were disabled. The sails were raised and Captain Carroll maneuvered the ship toward Bartlett Cove as she settled lower in the water. He beached her on a sandy shore about 1.5 miles from the rock. The rock splintered planking roughly and made a hole large enough for a man to crawl through. The gash in her hull was below the waterline, about from the bow on her starboard side. Luckily for Ancon, the site of the damage was a hold filled with 150 tons of coal. Flooding would have been quicker in an open space. Captain Carroll sent the ship's launch to Sitka on the morning of September 14 to seek help. The crew, when not otherwise engaged in repairs, assembled the staves and hoops of the 1,000 empty barrels in its cargo destined for the herring plant at Killisnoo (near modern Angoon) and put them in the hold for extra buoyancy. arrived on September 19 from Sitka, bringing carpenters and planking to make repairs. Additional materials were required, so Pinta made a quick trip to Juneau and returned on September 26. The next day, Idaho arrived on the scene. She had been dispatched from Port Townsend to look for the overdue Ancon. The passengers were transferred to Idaho, which then fetched another 2,500 empty barrels from Killisnoo. A cofferdam was built around the damaged area of Ancon's hull and temporary repairs were made. Pinta took off as much coal as she could, lightening Ancon, and then pulled her off the beach at high tide on October 2, 1886. Ancon paddled into Bartlett Cove and was beached again for additional repairs. Finally, she sailed to Juneau under her own power in company of Idaho and Pinta. The crew thought it likely that the 3,500 empty barrels in her hold would keep her afloat if the hull patch failed, but this theory was not tested; the ship made an uneventful passage to Juneau. Captain Carroll beached the ship again near a sawmill on Douglas Island to make sturdier repairs. On October 15, 1886 she sailed out of Juneau for Killisnoo, where she returned the empty barrels, and then south for permanent repairs. While the initial repairs were made on the beach, the passengers played cards, and the local Tlingit natives stopped by to see the unusual sight. There was no radio in 1886 and no other ship carried news of the wreck south. As Ancon became two weeks overdue, speculation began that she had been lost. Word of her fate finally reached the wider world by telegraph on October 8, 1886, when Idaho reached Victoria, British Columbia with Ancons passengers. Officers from the U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey were immediately sent to chart the rock, which they named, \\"Ancon Rock\\" in November 1886. By this time Ancon had sailed to San Francisco where she was hauled out of the water at the Merchant's Dry Dock Company for permanent repairs. By mid-December, she was back at sea on the San Francisco ‚Äì San Pedro route. A buoy at the site of the grounding now warns other ships of the submerged Ancon Rock. Albert Bierstadt's, \\"Wreck of the Ancon\\"  Wreck of Ancon (1889)  On August 12, 1889, Ancon sailed from Port Townsend on her regular Alaska run. She had aboard about 100 first-class passengers, 30 steerage passengers, and 70 crew under the command of Captain David Wallace. She stopped at Victoria, and then sailed directly to Tongass Narrows, roughly the site of modern Ketchikan. She made her usual stops at Loring, Wrangell, Juneau, Killisnoo, Sitka, and then anchored at the head of the Muir Glacier in Glacier Bay for the benefit of the tourists aboard. She stopped at Bartlett Cove briefly on her way out of Glacier Bay, and then sailed up Lynn Canal, stopping near modern Haines and Skagway. Ancon headed south from here, stopping again at Juneau, and Wrangell, before arriving back at the dock in Loring on August 27, 1889. Loring boasted a wharf at the salmon saltery, and Ancon tied up overnight to take aboard cases of processed salmon. She got underway again at 3 A.M. on August 28, 1889 and immediately ran onto a reef, well inside the harbor and only a few hundred feet from shore. Passenger reports suggest that the cause of the wreck was a line handling error as the ship left the wharf. The tide was ebbing, creating a current out of the harbor. The bow line was let go and the current began to swing the ship around, pivoting on the stern line, to face out of the harbor. The stern line was let go too early, however, and instead of turning so that the bow faced out, the ship drifted sideways up the bay. She grounded amidships, and stuck there as the tide fell. Ancon listed to port and the strain caused cabin doors to jam. Some passengers had to escape out their windows. As the receding water left her higher and higher on the rocks, the weight of the ship and her cargo broke her in two. Water flooded into the hold. Remains of Ancon, ca. 1895 The ship was so close to shore that it was a simple matter to transfer the passengers and their baggage in small boats. The crew also brought ashore food, bedding, and other supplies since they predicted correctly that some time would elapse before any help could be expected. The Alaska Packing Company, which owned the fish processing plant organized shelter among the company buildings, private homes, and even among the local Tlingit houses. Painter Albert Bierstadt took advantage of his time ashore. He wrote to his wife that he had a \\"narrow escape\\" from the shipwreck. Narrow or not, he escaped with his art supplies and completed 60 color studies and two books of drawings, including \\"Wreck of the Ancon\\". On September 1, 1889, George W. Elder reached Loring on her regular Alaska run. At this late date in the season there were few passengers aboard, so she could embark all of Ancons passengers and crew. There was brief consideration of George W. Elder continuing its Alaska itinerary, but consensus was reached to return south immediately, at least in part because no one knew of Ancons wreck and she would be weeks overdue by the time George W. Elder returned on her normal schedule. The passengers and crew arrived in Port Townsend on George W. Elder on September 5, 1889. Two-thirds of Ancons cargo of 13,835 cases of canned salmon, 182 barrels of salted salmon, gold bullion from the Juneau mines, and other merchandise was salvaged. Ancon herself never left. Her chains, anchors, and boats were salvaged, but the Pacific Coast Steamship company judged her wood construction and sidewheel technology obsolete and not worth repair, particularly since she was not insured. Indeed, she was one of the last sidewheel steamers on the coast, and some argued that the speed with which she broke apart on the reef was a sign that old age had rotted her timbers. The hulk was burned so as not to be a hazard to navigation. What parts were not salvaged or burned rotted and rusted away. The only remains are the thickest parts of the boilers which can be seen at low tide on the rock where they came to rest. Captain Wallace appears not have been blamed for the wreck since he was assigned to command City of Topeka which took Ancons place in the Pacific Coast Steamship Company's Alaska service.

Made from steel, brass and adorned with ivory and gold, the pistols are currently on display in Gallery 375.  Description  The flintlock pistols were made by Russian gunsmith Johan Adolph Grecke, who operated a workshop in the imperial capital of St. Petersburg. Grecke was employed by the imperial court to produce a number of ornately-decorated firearms, including the pair of pistols in question. Grecke notably continued to produce firearms with ivory stocks long after the style had fallen out of vogue in the rest of Europe.Wilson, R. Silk and Steel: Women at Arms. New York. Random House, 2003. p. 15 The pistols were originally part of a garniture that included a hunting rifle, a fowling piece (a shotgun), and said pair of pistols. This set was eventually split up; the hunting rife was given to Stanislas Poniatowski and later lost, while the fowling piece is in the collection of the National Museum, Warsaw. The pair of pistols was gifted to Metropolitan Museum of Art in 1986 by American banker John M. Schiff in memory of his wife, Edith Baker Schiff. The pistols' barrels are made from gun-quality steel, and their stocks are made from carved ivory. The bodies of the firearms are decorated with brass gold, as are the grips. In addition, the escutcheons on the weapon's grips bear an E for Ekaterine, Catherine the Great's name in Russian.

Announced on May 22, 2018 and released the same day along with the Samsung Galaxy J4 and the Samsung Galaxy J8, the J6 is a mid-range model smartphone and a successor to the Samsung Galaxy J5 (2017). The Galaxy J6 is the first in the J-series phones to have a near bezel-less design and to feature a sAMOLED 18.5:9 display. It has a similar hardware design and software features to its high-end counterpart, the Galaxy A6. The J6 is succeeded by the J6+ which featured a larger screen albeit switching from the sAMOLED screen found on the J6 to an LCD one. Hardware Rear face with fingerprint sensor of the Samsung Galaxy J6 purple lavender 4GB RAM/64GB ROM. The Samsung Galaxy J6 features a 720p Super AMOLED display, with an 18:5:9 aspect ratio dubbed as Samsung's ‚ÄòInfinity Display‚Äô. The J6 has a 5.6-inch panel, having around ~76.5% screen-to-body ratio and 294 ppi which was much similar to previous ones in the same line up. The J6's screen is protected by Corning Gorilla Glass 3. The rear body is made out of plastic (specifically polycarbonate) with the intention to give it the same premium feel as metal-back phones. The dimensions of the Samsung Galaxy J6 are 149.3 x 70.2 x 8.2 (height x width x thickness). The smartphone weighs . It is equipped with Samsung's in-house octa-core Exynos 7870 which is clocked at a maximum of 1.6 GHz. Charging the phone's 3,000 mAh lithium-ion battery takes about 2.5 hours on its micro-USB port. The phone comes with a single 13 MP rear camera with autofocus coupled with an LED flash. The front shooter has 8 MP also with its own front flash. The phone's cameras work well in daylight, though most criticisms point out the bad performance of the cameras in low light. Software The Samsung Galaxy J6 2018 comes with Android 8.0 (Oreo) out of the box with Samsung Experience UI. Samsung's own Bixby is present as \\"Bixby Home\\" on the phone though lacks the assistant features found on the flagship S and Note series phones. In May 2019, Samsung started rolling out its OTA software update for the Galaxy J6 to have the latest Android 9.0 (Pie) with One UI that also comes with Galaxy S10 phones. The update added features like night mode and a re- styled user interface. The phone is secured either by PIN, pattern, password, fingerprint, or facial recognition. Using the fingerprint and/or facial recognition requires one of the three aforementioned traditional security inputs. The phone comes protected by Samsung's Knox software.

He was count palatine of the Rhineland (r.1095/7-1113), and count of Weimar-Orlam√ºnde (r.1112-1113).  Life  Siegfried was born around 1075. He was the son of Adalbert II of Ballenstedt and Adelaide of Weimar-Orlam√ºnde, daughter of Otto I of Meissen and his wife, Adela of Louvain. Siegfried's father, Adalbert, was murdered by Egeno II of Konradsburg in 1080, and Siegfried's brother, Otto the Rich, succeeded him as count of Ballenstedt. Siegfried inherited his father's property in Nordth√ºringengau.Thiele, Erz√§hlende genealogische Stammtafeln, table 158. After Adalbert's death, Siegfried's mother remarried twice, to two successive counts palatine of the Rhineland: first, Hermann II (d.1085), and then Henry of Laach (d.1095).Partenheimer, Albrecht der B√§r, pp. 285f.; Thiele, Erz√§hlende genealogische Stammtafeln, table 167.

In 1112 Ulric II of Weimar-Orlam√ºnde died without heirs. By virtue of his mother, Adelaide's, kinship, Siegfried then claimed Ulric's title.Loud and Schenk, Origins of the German, p. xxvi. This led Siegfried into conflict with Emperor Henry V. Imperial partisans attacked Siegfried at the Teufelsmauer in the Harz on 21 February 1113. Siegfried survived the attack, but died of his injuries on 9 March 1113.Ekkehardi Chronica, a.1113, p. 261; Thiele, Erz√§hlende genealogische Stammtafeln, table 158.

She has won the Shincho Prize for New Writers, the Oda Sakunosuke Prize, and the Akutagawa Prize.  Early life and education  Oyamada was born in Hiroshima and remained there throughout her school years, eventually graduating from Hiroshima University in 2006 with a degree in Japanese literature. After graduation Oyamada changed jobs three times in five years, an experience that inspired her debut story \\"K≈çj≈ç\\" (\\"Factory\\"), which received the 42nd Shincho Prize for New Writers in 2010. After her debut Oyamada worked a part-time editorial job at a local magazine, but quit after marrying a co-worker.  Career  In 2013 Oyamada won the 30th Oda Sakunosuke Prize for a short story collection containing \\"K≈çj≈ç\\" as the title story. Later that year Oyamada's novella Ana (Hole), about a woman who falls into a hole, was published in the literary magazine Shinch≈ç. Ana won the 150th Akutagawa Prize. One of the Akutagawa Prize judges, author Hiromi Kawakami, commended Oyamada's ability to write about \\"fantasy in a reality setting.\\" In 2014 Oyamada received the 5th Hiroshima Cultural Newcomer Award for her cultural contributions. In 2018 Oyamada's third book, a short story collection called Niwa (Garden), was published by Shinchosha. An English edition of \\"K≈çj≈ç\\", translated by David Boyd, was published by New Directions Publishing under the title The Factory in 2019. Writing for The Wall Street Journal, Sam Sacks noted that the \\"tonal blandness\\" of the writing style matched the feeling of repetitive, meaningless office work. In a starred review of The Factory for Publishers Weekly, Gabe Habash praised Oyamada's ability to make the reader experience the same disorientation as the book's main character, concluding that the book would leave readers \\"reeling and beguiled\\". Oyamada has cited Franz Kafka and Mario Vargas Llosa as literary influences. In his review of Granta's special issue on Japanese literature, James Hadfield of The Japan Times compared Oyamada's writing to that of Y≈çko Ogawa and said that her work \\"suggests good things to come from this promising young writer.\\" Oyamada lives in Hiroshima with her husband and daughter.

Battle for third Finals Francis Arnaiz and Robert Jaworski took charge in finally applying the brakes on Crispa's last-ditch offensive, unleashing a telling 10-2 blast that gave Toyota an unreachable 97-86 lead, one minute and 30 seconds left. Francis Arnaiz banged in his team's last six points in overtime from an imposing 115-110 Crispa spread and insuring a Toyota victory with a clinching drive in the last five seconds that propelled Toyota on top, 118-115. Four Silver Tamaraws fouled out just before the extension period. The Silver Tamaraws blew a six-point lead in regulation, 106-100, with 1:30 left, the fighting Redmanizers level the count at 106-all on a split charities by Bernie Fabiosa that forces overtime. A 5-0 blast in the last 60 seconds, four of them by Freddie Hubalde, put Crispa ahead and beyond recall, 115-103, after the Silver Tamaraws briefly threatened with five minutes left in the ballgame. Atoy Co sizzled with 34 points as he combined with Cyrus Mann, who hauled down rebounds and block shots. Though Francis Arnaiz fired 22 points for Toyota, Ramon Fernandez was limited to only 11 while Robert Jaworski finished with only seven points. A jumper by Cyrus Mann with 30 seconds left provided the Redmanizers the victory and sent the title series to a rubbermatch. The Silver Tamaraws rallied in the last two minutes from a 91-102 deficit. Crispa got their biggest lead of 14 points, 89-75, at the start of the fourth period on an 8-2 run with Atoy Co hitting two baskets and Mann and Philip Cezar combined for two points each. Fortunato \\"Atoy\\" Co rattled six straight points to give Crispa an 11-point spread at the half, 51-40. The Silver Tamaraws came back strongly in the third quarter with eight successive points to narrow the gap at 48-51. The Redmanizers did not panic and a 9-2 salvo gave them a 10-point lead quickly, 60-50. The Redmanizers answered the Silver Tamaraws basket for basket and in the last two minutes, the Silver Tamaraws, demoralized by the impending defeat, lowered their guards completely, allowing Crispa to scored their biggest winning margin in the series.

While Michael Phillips commented on the difficulty of translating the early 1980s movie to stage ‚àí especially in an era of more gender fluidity ‚Äì Phillips noted the reviews have ranged \\"from so-so to very good\\", while also observing the \\"opening night laughs were plentiful and the performances savvy\\". In her review of the Broadway production in Variety, Marilyn Stasio wrote \\"The new Broadway adaptation of Tootsie is old-fashioned and proud of it ‚Äî and it‚Äôs a surefire crowd-pleaser... this affectionate sendup of a Broadway musical (replacing the movie‚Äôs soap opera setting) and its uniquely unlikely star. Director Scott Ellis leaves nothing and no one unscathed in staging this satire of a Broadway-bound musical called Juliet‚Äôs Nurse...That‚Äôs the mixed blessing of Yazbek‚Äôs score: the lyrics are so smart, the music can‚Äôt always catch up with them...

She made nine voyages for the British East India Company (EIC). In each of her first, second, and third voyages she was involved in a notable action. The remainder of her voyages appear to have proceeded without incident. She ceased sailing for the EIC in 1823 and was broken up c.1827. Career EIC voyage #1 (1800‚Äì1801) Captain John Ramsden acquired a letter of marque on 24 March 1800. He sailed from Torbay on 27 May 1800, bound for China. Dorsetshire was part of a convoy that also included , , , and , the Botany Bay ships and , and the whaler .Lloyd's List, ‚Ññ4117. Their escort was the small ship of the line . On the morning of 4 August they encountered French squadron consisting of the frigates Concorde, M√©d√©e, and Franchise. The French commander was concerned that he had encountered a fleet of powerful warships so he turned to escape. The British commander, Captain Rowley Bulteel, immediately ordered a pursuit. To preserve the impression of warships he also ordered four of his most powerful East Indiamen to join the chase. First Belliqueux captured Concorde. Exeter and Bombay Castle set out after M√©d√©e and succeeded in coming up with her after dark and tricking her into surrendering to what M√©d√©e thought was a ship of the line. Dorsetshire reached Rio de Janeiro on 12 August and arrived at Whampoa anchorage on 21 February 1801. Homeward bound, she crossed the Second Bar on 7 May Second Bar.

He sailed from The Downs on 27 April 1803, bound for China. Dorsetshire arrived at Whampoa on 3 September. She was at the Second Bar on 25 November, but did not leave China until 6 February 1804. She was part of a convoy of returning East Indiamen and other vessels, all under the command of Captain Nathaniel Dance. The Royal Navy was unable to provide an escort and the captains of the EIC's China Fleet debated about setting out for home. Still, the China Fleet was at the Second Bar on 31 January 1804 and left China on 6 February. As they were passing through the Straits of Malacca on 14 February, they encountered a French squadron under Rear-Admiral the Comte de Linois. Dance sent the brig Ganges and three Indiamen to approach the strange vessels and investigate. It quickly became clear that the strange vessels were enemy warships. Dance ordered his fleet to form a line of battle, while creating a bluff that four of his Indiamen were a squadron of ships of the line escorting the convoy. A skirmish ensued with the result that Linois, somewhat inexplicably, withdrew. On 18 February the Indiamen were at Malacca. On 28 February, the British ships of the line and joined the Fleet in the Strait and conducted them safely to St Helena.Lloyd's List, n¬∞4478.

It was established in 1976 as the Business Council on National Issues (BCNI). Its members include CEOs of Canada's leading companies and pre-eminent entrepreneurs. BCC (and its iterations as BCNI and CCCE) has been described as \\"Canada's most powerful lobby group\\" with \\"Canada's number-one free-market conservative\\" (Thomas d'Aquino) as CEO for almost three decades, until his resignation in 2009. By 2016, BCC's 150 CEOs and entrepreneurs \\"employ[ed] 1.4 million Canadians, account[ed] for more than half the value of the Toronto Stock Exchange, contribute[d] the largest share of federal corporate taxes, and [were] responsible for most of Canada's exports, corporate philanthropy, and private-sector investments in research and development.\\" Board of directors In 2018, Goldy Hyder succeeded John Manley as the President and CEO of the Business Council of Canada, who had been in the position since Thomas d'Aquino stepped down in 2009. Membership According to a January 2016 BCC article, members of the \\"40-year-old organization\\" are \\"CEOs of 150 leading Canadian companies and pre-eminent entrepreneurs of 150 leading Canadian companies\\" that \\"employ 1.4 million Canadians, account for more than half the value of the Toronto Stock Exchange, contribute the largest share of federal corporate taxes, and are responsible for most of Canada's exports, corporate philanthropy, and private-sector investments in research and development.\\" History The Canadian Council of Chief Executives (CCCE), renamed Business Council of Canada in 2016, was originally known as the Business Council on National Issues (BCNI) when it formed in the 1976. Tenure of Thomas d'Aquino (1981-2009) In 1981, when Thomas d'Aquino was named as Business Council on National Issues's CEO, \\"not many companies were truly global players. The vast majority were inward-looking. As a result of globalization and free trade, we have considerably more companies that are truly global.\\" He was 40-years-old and most of the CEO's were ten or twenty years older than he was. In 1981, the Business Council on National Issues (BCNI) ‚Äî which then represented approximately 140 major corporations across Canada and represented \\"well over $125 billion in annual sales\\" ‚Äî commissioned a booklet entitled \\"A Citizen's Guide to the Constitutional Question.\\" This was submitted to the Special Joint Committee on the Constitution (SJC), a special joint committee of the House of Commons of Canada and the Senate of Canada to receive submissions regarding the patriation of the Constitution of Canada. The Citizen's Guide was accompanied by a letter, in which the BCNI advocated for the protection of economic rights, including \\"property rights, rights to due process and to just compensation\\", \\"not just to individuals or citizens, but to all persons, including corporate persons.\\" The called for \\"mobility rights\\", the right to \\"move goods, services, capital, entrepreneurship, freely within the territorial boundaries of Canada.\\" In the name of economic efficiency, the BCNI called for the elimination of internal barriers to trade in order to be competitive. They wrote that, the \\"preservation of relatively free inter-provincial trade within the Canadian federation is essential to the economic welfare of all Canadians.\\" D'Aquino was one of the \\"private sector architects\\" of the \\"Canada-United States free trade initiative\\" and NAFTA. One of BCNI's early achievements included a major study on parliamentary reform undertaken by BCNI resulting in the 1983 publication of Parliamentary Democracy in Canada: Issues for reform. Another early success was BCNI's role in engineering the landmark 1985 Western Accord on Energy. BCNI arranged a series of meetings between \\"oil executives and the Alberta Government, industrialists and the Ontario government, and bankers and the Federal Government.\\" Cited in Langille 1987 The Western Accord signed on June 1, 1985, replaced the reviled National Energy Program. It \\"was virtually an echo of the BCNI's proposals.\\" It included \\"deregulation of crude oil prices, leaving the Canadian price free to respond to world market forces; deregulation of natural gas prices and a severing of the link between gas and oil prices; Lowering of federal taxes and provincial royalties; basing resource taxation on profits rather than revenues; Provision of exploration and development incentives through the tax system instead of through grants.\\" In an August 1986 interview in Ottawa, d'Aquino was \\"concerned to differentiate the BCNI from neo-conservative bodies such as the National Citizen's Coalition or the Fraser Institute.\\" By 1987, BCNI members included the CEOs of 150 Canadian corporations representing $700 billion in assets. By 1987, the BCNI has been successful in forging \\"common positions on major issues... [despite] the wide diversity of sectoral and regional representation ... consensus has been achieved in virtually every task force initiative since 1981.\\" The BCNI \\"asks members to consider issues from a national perspective. Advocacy of individual company concerns is discouraged. Second, great emphasis is placed on balancing interests when specific issues are under consideration. This requires compromise and long-term thinking. Another reason lies in the values which members share, values shaped by a belief in the liberal democratic tradition, in the market economy, in limited and accountable government, and in an independent Canada within a strong Western alliance.\\"BCNI. \\"Information Brochure-1985\\".\\"Business Council on National Issues, 1976-1986\\" (Ottawa, 1986), cited in Langille. D'Aquino had a good relationship with every Canadian Prime Minister. In 1999, the BCNI membership \\"administered more than $2 trillion in assets, ha[d] a yearly turnover of more than $500 billion, employ[ed] about one in ten working Canadians and [were] responsible for a majority of Canadian private sector investment, exports, research and development and training.\\" d'Aquino noted that Canada had cut inflation and interest rates, expanded exports and jobs and reduced government deficits, but he called on the federal to make \\"significant tax cuts.\\" In a talk to the BCNI in the fall of 2000, against the backdrop of the \\"growing anti-globalization movement\\", d'Aquino, echoing Fred Bernsten, reminded Canadian CEOs \\"not to take globalization for granted.\\" Globalization was reversible. \\"From the perspective of enlightened self-interest, d'Aquino noted that business leaders had to spend more time explaining the benefits of globalization, become better global citizens and devote greater resources towards \\"shoring up and improving key global institutions.\\" In 2004, the BCNI was renamed the Canadian Council of Chief Executives (CCCE). In his 2004 book, The Return of the State: Protestors, Power-Brokers and the New Global Compromise, York University professor, Adam Harmes described d'Aquino as \\"Canada's number-one free-market conservative\\" and the Canadian Council of Chief Executives (CCCE), formerly the BCNI, as \\"Canada's most powerful lobby group\\". By 2009, as a \\"result of globalization and free trade, [Canada had] considerably more companies that are truly global.\\"CCCE's 150 CEOs represented \\"$4.5 trillion in assets with $850 billion in revenues.\\" When d'Aquino stepped down as CEO, the CCCE named him as a Distinguished Lifetime Member. In 2009 d'Aquino was described by Globe and Mail's John Lorinc as Canada's \\"behind- the-scenes prime minister\\" and the \\"most influential corporate tout\\" for almost 30 years. D'Aquino was listed among the top 100 most influential people in Canada in the 20th century. John Manley (2009-2018) In January 2016, the CCCE was renamed the Business Council of Canada. According to a BCC January 2016 article, members of the \\"40-year-old organization\\" are \\"CEOs and entrepreneurs of 150 leading Canadian companies\\" that \\"employ[ed] 1.4 million Canadians, account[ed] for more than half the value of the Toronto Stock Exchange, contribute[d] the largest share of federal corporate taxes, and [were] responsible for most of Canada's exports, corporate philanthropy, and private-sector investments in research and development.\\" Goldy Hyder (2018) In 2018, Goldy Hyder succeeded John Manley as the President and CEO of the Business Council of Canada, who had been in the position since Thomas d'Aquino stepped down in 2009.

It's located in Mount Rainier National Park, south of Mount Rainier. The descriptive name is for the mountain's resemblance to the head and horn of a unicorn. The name was officially adopted in 1913 by the U.S. Board on Geographic Names. Precipitation runoff from the mountain's small glaciers, such as Unicorn Glacier, drains into tributaries of the Cowlitz River. Climate Unicorn Peak is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range (Orographic lift), causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades. As a result, the west side of the North Cascades experiences high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. Due to its temperate climate and proximity to the Pacific Ocean, areas west of the Cascade Crest very rarely experience temperatures below or above . During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer. Because of maritime influence, snow tends to be wet and heavy, resulting in high avalanche danger.

It is a large house in the Georgian Revival style with extensive grounds. The project's design was the result of the collaboration of Mr. and Mrs. Neufeld with architect Clarence O. Jahn. Albert Ebner was responsible for the original interior decorating. Lowell Hansen designed the grounds. Jens Jensen was retained as an active consultant on the landscaping for the property. The interior features a high level of detail. The dining room is wallpapered with antique Zuber scenes of the American Revolution. Quarter sawn, Appalachian white oak raised paneling was used in the library. The house is distinguished by its lack of hallways; all rooms are connected by galleries, and by a 260-foot view through the center of the house, ending in a grape arbor. Following Carleton Varney's updating of the interiors in 1976, Architectural Digest featured the house in its November 1977 issue. It was also included in the 100 year anniversary retrospective edition of Architectural Digest in 1999. The Wisconsin Historical Society placed the property on the State Register of Historic Places on February 16, 2018, and it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on June 15, 2018.

The agency splits its inventory of state highway mileage into four categories: *The State Primary System includes Interstate Highways, Parkways, and other long-distance highways of statewide importance that connect the state's major cities, including much of the courses of Kentucky's U.S. Highways. *The State Secondary System includes highways of regional importance that connect the state's smaller urban centers, including those county seats not served by the state primary system. *The Rural Secondary System includes highways of local importance, such as farm-to-market roads and urban collectors. *Supplemental Roads are the set of highways not in the first three systems, including frontage roads, bypassed portions of other state highways, and rural roads that only serve their immediate area. The same-numbered highway can comprise sections of road under different categories. This list contains descriptions of Supplemental Roads and highways in the Rural Secondary System numbered 400 to 499 that do not have portions within the State Primary and State Secondary systems. __NOTOC__ KY 400 Kentucky Route 400 is a supplemental road in the city of Oak Grove in southern Christian County. The highway begins at US 41 Alt. (Fort Campbell Boulevard) at the eastern edge of Fort Campbell just north of the Tennessee state line. KY 400 heads east along State Line Road, which runs immediately north of the state line. The highway turns north away from the state line and veers east again to its terminus at KY 115 (Pembroke‚ÄìOak Grove Road). The Kentucky Transportation Cabinet established KY 400 through a March 30, 1987, official order. The route was added as a rural secondary highway; however, the highway was reclassified as a supplemental road at an unknown date, returned to the rural secondary system through an October 26, 2004, official order, and returned to the supplemental road system after a December 9, 2010, official order.

The carriages run services in mainland China, and on the Trans-siberian railway for international services to Moscow. They are also exported to Mombasa-Narobi railways, Ethio-Djjbouti railways and Guinea railways, and also to be exported to Swedish state railways (intended to replace SJ 1960-series coaches) and Uganda Standard Gauge railways.  Development  After the success of building the China Railways 25A rolling stocks, the Railway Bureau of China (now China Railway) decided to develop a new type of \\"Upgraded 25.5 metre sized air-conditioned and non air-conditioned passenger coaches\\" (ÂçáÁ∫ßÊç¢‰ª£‰∫ßÂìÅ 25.5Á±≥Á©∫Ë∞ÉÂíåÈùûÁ©∫Ë∞ÉÂÆ¢ËΩ¶). The development lasted for a year till the first 25G carriage was built in Changchun Rolling Stocks Factory (now CRRC Changchun) and first used on the express train 13/4 Beijing to Shanghai to replace the 22 coaches.  Improvements   2nd Generation (2002-2003)  To meet the 25B and 25G coaches standard in 2002, the newly built coaches were fitted with new bogies. Those bogies are still used on modern 25G coaches with Anti-wheelslip devices and disc brakes. Most trains are fitted with sliding doors, double layer windows and rubber connections between coaches. Some of them are also fitted with vacuum sewage compartments and sealed connections. However, not all new generation coaches had those devices.  3rd Generation (2004-)  To meet the 25G coaches standard in 2004, all new-built 25G rolling stocks are equipped with disc and air brakes. 25G scoaches built after 2003 are fitted with DC-AC converters, and available to convert the DC600V electric charge into AC380V, AC220V, AC110V electric charges to serve the brake, air- conditioning, lighting and power outlet systems. Most 3rd-generation 25Gs built after 2008 removed the sliding doors and vacuum sewage compartments to reduce maintenance costs.  Usage  Since the 25G coaches were first built in 1991, those coaches have been running on lines all over China as well as many other countries, most of them using Chinese standard. A typical 25G consist for K-series trains usually have 6 to 9 hard seat cars (YZ25G, the YZ stands for hard seat or Á°¨Â∫ß, y√¨ngz√πo), one dining car (CA25G, the CA stands for È§êËΩ¶, cƒÅnchƒì), one soft sleeper car (RW25G, the RW stands for ËΩØÂçß, ru«énw√≤), several hard sleeper cars (YW25G, the YW stands for Á°¨Âçß, y√¨ngw√≤) and a luggage car (XL25G, XL stands for Ë°åÊùé). Some of the trains run on non-electrified routes and cannot receive electric supplies from locomotives are also fitted with a generator car (KD25G, the KD stands for Á©∫Ë∞ÉÂèëÁîµ, k≈çngti√°ofƒÅdi√†n). Some trains also have soft seat cars (RZ25G, the RZ stands for ËΩØÂ∫ß, ru«énzu√≤).  Accidents and Incidents  * On June 18, 2004, a KD25G generator car and a DF11 locomotive on passenger train 1539 from Xinxiang to Shenzhen via Beijing- Kowloon line were hit by a collapsed concrete part of a ditch. No one was hurt, but the incident caused damage to the locomotive and the generator car, and a 9-hour delay. * On November 19, 2004 at 22:32, 8 runaway freight cars from Harbin West line collided with passenger train K340 (Jiamusi-Beijing) in Guxiang yard, Harbin, derailing the SS9 locomotive, a XL25G luggage car and a YW25G hard sleeper car. * On July 31, 2005 at 19:52, train K127 (Xi'an- Changchun) using a SS9 locomotive and several 25G stocks met a signal failure between Xinchengzi and Xintaizi on Changchun-Dalian railway line (now Beijing- Harbin line) caused by a missing routing box. The driver made a serious fault to shut off the LKJ monitor (like the AWS system in UK), and crashed into the freight train 33219, causing a serious accident. The locomotive was seriously damaged (\\"The aerodynamic head was completely flattened\\"), a XL25G luggage car and a YW25G hard sleeper car turned over. Three YW25G hard sleeper cars also derailed. * On November 17, 2005 at 00:50, train K27 from Beijing to Dandong caught fire in a KD25G generator car on Qinhuangdao-Shenyang line. The train had an emergency stop after workers have used out all the fire extinguishers. The overhead wire was damaged by the fire, and the generator car was destroyed in the accident. No one was injured. * On June 11, 2006 at 09:24, train T159 from Qingdao to Guangzhou East crashed into train 1017 on Beijing-Kwoloon line between Linzhai and Dongshui. The driver unlocked the LKJ system and ran over a red light. The accident caused a 10-hour shutdown of the railway line and more than 20 injuries. * On February 28 at 02:05, some carriages of train 5807 from Urumchi to Aksu was blown over by strong wind between Zhenzhuquan and Hongshanqu stations. Cars 9 to 19 derailed and turned over. The accident caused 3 deaths and 34 injuries. * On January 3 st 14:44, train K23 from Moscow to Beijing via Ulan Bator caught fire in the KD25G generator car. The train was delayed but there were no injuries. * On June 29, 2009 at 02:31, train K9017 had a brake failure when approaching Bangzhou Station, running over a switch and crashed into train K9063. The accident caused 3 deaths and 63 injuries. The cause of the accident was that a worker in CRRC Nanjing Puzhen left a lid inside the braking pipes of a 25G stock, which completely jammed the braking system of the train. * On May 23, 2010 at 02:10, train K859 met a hill collapse. Carriages 1 to 5 rolled over while 6 to 8 derailed (all YZ25Gs). Car 6 \\"slammed\\" onto car 4. Car 7 to car 9 were twisted into a zigzag shape. The accident caused 19 deaths and 71 injuries. * On August 19, 2010 at 15:00, train K165 from Xi'an to Kunming was stopped by a worker for the bridge ahead was tilting because of a flood. The driver evacuated the passengers before the bridge finally went out and cars 15 and 16 (both YW25G) fell into the river. No one was injured in the incident, but the line was closed for 60 days. The 45 km/h speed limit on the bridge was lifted in April 2014. * On November 15, 2010 at around 3am, the 5th car of the train K157 (YZ25G) derailed in Liuzhou South Station. * On August 16, 2013 at 04:10, a generator car (KD25G) caught fire. The train was delayed for 2 hours and 33 minutes, but nobody was injured. The cause of the incident was that the generator operator fell asleep and didn't notice a leaked cylinder (made by CRRC Qingdao Sifang), as well as the alarm of the smoke detector. * On April 13, 2014 at 03:17, train K7034 from Heihe to Harbin derailed on the Harbin-Beian railway line. The cause was a worker, who was unsatisfied with his job, removed a 12-metre long rail from the track. The accident caused a 16-hour shutdown of the Harbin-Beian line and 15 injuries.

The drones are specifically designed for small parcel delivery. Each aircraft features propellers, like a classic drone, along with a wing to help it cover long distances quickly. Its motors are powered by electric batteries. For safety purposes, the aircraft features many redundant systems (extra propellers, batteries, etc.) so that if anything were to malfunction, flight can continue until a mechanic can address the issue. The aircraft takes off vertically and then enters a forward-flight phase with lift being provided by a fixed wing. The flightpath the aircraft follows is determined by Wing's UTM (Unmanned Traffic Management) System, which optimizes the route for time and distance efficiency while ensuring the plane's path will be obstacle-free. To assist in navigating unforeseen obstacles, the aircraft is equipped with black and white cameras that detect and analyze shapes without observing distinct features in order to preserve community privacy while maintaining safe flight.

Climate Lane Peak is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range (Orographic lift), causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades. As a result, the west side of the North Cascades experiences high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. Due to its temperate climate and proximity to the Pacific Ocean, areas west of the Cascade Crest very rarely experience temperatures below or above . During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer. Because of maritime influence, snow tends to be wet and heavy, resulting in high avalanche danger.

It was built from in 1925 by George Bunyan and family. It is also known as Old Bar Airstrip and Old Bar Aerodrome. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 25 February 2000.  History  Old Bar Airfield was constructed in the mid 1920s by George Bunyan as part of the fledgling air mail and aerial passenger services following the Commonwealth Government's decision to call tenders to award contracts for these services. 44 Aerodromes and 90 Emergency Landing Grounds were established in the years to 1926 and Old Bar was the main refueling stop between Sydney and Brisbane. The airfield was designated as an \\"aerodrome\\" on 6 November 1930 by the Department of Defence. A major historical event was the Air Pageant held on 15 and 16 November 1930 with 35 planes including the \\"Canberra\\" owned by Sir Charles Kingsford Smith and the \\"City of Lismore\\" piloted by Captain Charles Ulm. The pageant featured \\"joyrides\\" typical of the early aviation \\"barnstorming\\" tradition. The airfield was the refueling point for Kingsford-Smith and Ulm's Australian National Airways till mid 1931. From July, 1931 New England Airways operated a bi-weekly air service between Sydney and Brisbane stopping at Lismore, Grafton, Coffs Harbour and Old Bar. The Royal Australian Air Force utilised the airstrip for refueling from the mid to late 1930s with regular visits of up to six Hawker Demons at Old Bar. For twelve months during 1939-40, the RAAF stationed a Wackett Gannet at Old Bar to undertake coastal surveying and mapping. The Old Bar Aerodrome was designated an emergency landing field for the RAAF during World War II. The Old Bar Airstrip was visited constantly by the key Australian aviation pioneers including Kingsford-Smith, Ulm, Jean Batten and Nancy Bird Walton. The Airfield was closed by Greater Taree City Council in February 1989 but was subsequently re-opened on the order of the then state Minister for Natural Resources, the Hon. Ian Causley. On 1 January, 1995 Greater Taree City Council removed runway markers, flight strip markers and the wind sock, effectively closing the airfield. The markers and windsock are presently stored at Taree Airport.(National Trust of Australia (NSW) 1998) Prior to the site's heritage listing in February 2000, the council proposed to convert the airstrip site to playing fields and a skateboarding rink, with only token \\"special occasion\\" landings on what would become sporting fields. In 2000 a 1.2m high post and wire fence 200m long was constructed at the airstrip's southern end. The 60m wide southern end is also to be fenced, as required by Council's insurers. This will allow the airstrip to be used for landings and take-offs without risk of any vehicle or person crossing the airstrip at the critical moment.Heritage Branch report, 20/8/2000  Description  Old Bar Airstrip is located near Old Bar Beach and is now surrounded by recreation facilities, caravan park and residential subdivision. The Old Bar airfield is situated at the southern end of Old Bar Park immediately west of Old Bar Beach and adjoining Old Bar Road. While in their beginnings such fields initially accepted aircraft landings from a range of directions the terrain and remnant native vegetation suggest strongly that the current airstrip developed early in the airfield's history. The airstrip is grassed on a compacted clay base, follows a north-south alignment and is approximately 675 metres in length by an average 60 metres in width. Adjoining the airstrip to the west is an area of native wet heath vegetation containing the vulnerable plant species, Austral toadflax, (Thesium australe) and to the north and west are native eucalypt woodlands. Various ephemera such as markers, fuel shed and windsock have been removed over the years. Of these the windsock and runway and flight strip markers are being stored at Taree Airport. A concrete slab at the south eastern end of the runway may be the foundation slab for the 1940s pump (National Trust of Australia (NSW) 1998) It was reported to be in excellent physical condition with medium archaeological potential as at 19 July 1999. It was believed that the underground fuel tank may still be on site and intact; however, subsequent investigations have found no trace and local informants recalled that they were removed sometime in the 1960s.. There may also be remnants of the former fuel pump.(National Trust of Australia (NSW) 1998) Old Bar Airfield is largely intact. It was always a simple grassed airstrip in a native vegetation setting and it remains in this condition to the present day. Ephemera such as the windsock and fuel tanks have been re-sited but the windsock is in storage and could be reinstated.(National Trust of Australia (NSW) 1998)  Heritage listing  The Old Bar Airfield has national historic significance as a rare intact and representative example of a key \\"aerodrome\\" from the earliest days of Australian aviation which has direct and important links with the nation's major aviation pioneers Sir Charles Kingsford-Smith, Captain C. T. P. Ulm, Jean Batten and Nancy Bird Walton. The Airfield was a vital component in the development of Australia's air mail and aerial passenger services, was the site of an historic 1930 air pageant and was utilised by the RAAF during the Second World War for refueling and coastal mapping and surveying. The Airfield has significance for its ability to contribute to an understanding of the cultural history of Australia's earliest development of an aviation industry including air mail, passenger services and associated joy flight/aerial pageantry activity. The Old Bar Airfield has social significance to the aviation community throughout Australia and also to the local community particularly older residents who have witnessed the town's growth in association with the airfield and who for many years have campaigned for the Airfield's permanent protection. The Airfield has high aesthetic significance when viewed from the air because of its coastal setting immediately adjoining the coastline within a bushland setting and with the backdrop of the Manning River Estuary. The Airfield has landmark qualities for the town of Old Bar(National Trust of Australia (NSW) 1998) Old Bar Airfield was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 25 February 2000 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. The item is historically significant because of its key role in the development of Australia's air mail and aerial passenger services, its direct association with aviation pioneers Sir Charles Kingsford-Smith, Captain C.T.P Ulm, Jean Batten and Nancy Bird Walton, as the site of an historic air pageant in 1930 and its military use during World War II as a refueling and coastal mapping and surveying station for the RAAF.(National Trust of Australia (NSW) 1998) The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. The item has high aesthetic significance when viewed from the air because of its setting immediately adjoining the coastline, within an area of native heath vegetation, fringed by eucalypt woodland and with the backdrop of the Manning Estuary and from the aerial perspective the airfield is the predominant landmark with strong sensory appeal in the town of Old Bar.(National Trust of Australia (NSW) 1998) The place has strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The item is socially significant because both the local community and the aviation community throughout Australia have recognised and are directly associated with its long history and have campaigned vigorously over many years for its recognition and conservation.(National Trust of Australia (NSW) 1998) The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The item has major significance for its ability to contribute to an understanding of the cultural history of Australia's earliest development of an aviation industry and its role in air mail, aerial passenger services and joy flight/aerial pageantry activity.(National Trust of Australia (NSW) 1998) The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. Old Bar Airfield is a very rare example of an historic airfield in a coastal town setting, similar airfields have been upgraded with tarmac and facilities or have been closed for redevelopment.(National Trust of Australia (NSW) 1998) The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. Old Bar Airfield represents the typical grassed airfield of the 1920s/1930s that were utilised by Australia's newly founded aviation industry. Its coastal setting with river backdrop, its overall size, runway length and low grassed appearance are compatible with and reminiscent of the 1920s/1930s Kingsford-Smith Airport in Sydney.(National Trust of Australia (NSW) 1998)  See also   References   Bibliography  * *  Attribution  Category:New South Wales State Heritage Register Category:Airports in New South Wales Category:Articles incorporating text from the New South Wales State Heritage Register Category:Mid-Coast Council ","title":"Old Bar Airfield"},{"id":"57898394","text":"Maierhofer is a surname.

The Hudson County Park Commission was created in 1892 to plan a park and boulevard system like those provided in other cities such as Boston and Newark. (There had been discussions of building a county long road as early as the 1870s.) The first feature the commission initiated was a boulevard that would connect the future parks called Hudson Boulevard (renamed John F. Kennedy Boulevard in the 1960s). It was constructed from 1892 to 1897, under Chief Engineer Edlow W. Harrison, in some places incorporating existing roads and became the county's principal north-south corridor. From Bayonne it wound north 14 miles to the Bergen County line. It was finished a few years later when it turned east in a loop and went south again as (Hudson) Boulevard East along the top edge of the Bergen Hill cliff to end at King's Bluff in Weehawken. In 1908 the State of New Jersey reconstructed the road to \\"improve and beautify it\\". The architects Daniel W. Langton and Charles N.

As fronts approach, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range (Orographic lift), causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades. As a result, the west side of the North Cascades experiences high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008.

It is currently the only oil refinery in Azerbaijan, capable of producing about of refined products per day. The refinery meets the entire domestic demand for petroleum products and exports more than 40% of the products. The plant processes 15 different products including gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, black oil, petroleum coke, asphalt, lubricants etc. It is owned and operated by SOCAR, which is the national oil company of the Azerbaijan Republic. History Construction of the complex of catalytic cracking units was launched in Baku by the decision of the Ministry of Oil Industry of the USSR in the former Soviet Union. A few years later, the first technological devices were placed in service. The order was issued on the establishment of the New Baku Refinery by the Ministry of Oil Industry of the USSR on date July 29, 1953. At the time, there was a shortage of high-quality gasoline in the Soviet Union, and it was natural to build the refinery in Baku, close to oil deposits. More than 300 million tons of oil has been processed, as well as new devices have been constructed, various types of oil products have been produced in Baku Oil Refinery named after Heydar Aliyev over a period of 50 years. 21 out of 24 types of oil are processed in the Baku Oil Refinery named after Heydar Aliyev. 15 kinds of oil products are produced here as well as automobile gasoline, aviation kerosene, oil coke, black oil, diesel fuel. Following high-tech forces operate in the plant such as ED-AV-6 facility on initial processing of oil (exploitation year 1976), the catalytic reforming unit (1980), the gradual coking unit (1986), and the catalytic cracking unit (1993). The main unit on the primary processing of oil is ELOU- AVT-6. It is a combined-atmosphere-vacuum device with oil pre-desalination and petrol recycling blocks having capacity to process up to 6 million tons of crude oil a year. This unit is constructed in 1976 according to the reconstruction plan of Baku oil refineries. The main spare parts of the device were received from Germany. In recent years, 80-90% of the pumping process has been replaced by the ELOU-AVT-6, the vacuum-generating system has been reconstructed. In order to improve heat exchange processes, 15 new technological layouts have been applied to prevent heat losses which is equal to 13-15 thousand conventional fuel. The main technological unit of the refinery is ED-AV-6 which was placed into service in 1976. It is a primary processing unit with electric desalting and vacuum distillation blocks of black oil. In order to meet requirements of international standards of oil, the project was organized on cleaning the fuel with alkali and production of crude naphthenic acid in this unit under the license of ‚ÄúMerichem‚Äù company (USA). Catalytic cracking device for the production of high octane gasoline components was built and put in service in 1993. Besides the catalytic reforming unit exploited in 1980, it helps to increase the quality of produced diesel fuel and gasoline. In honour of the 50th anniversary of \\"Azerneftyanajag\\" Oil Refinery and its achievements in production, it was renamed after Heydar Aliyev, the leader of Azerbaijan on April 22, 2004. By order of SOCAR dated December 24, 2014, SOCAR merged it with another refinery located in Baku, Azneftyag, making it the only refinery in the country on January 1, 2015. The purpose of SOCAR in uniting Azerneftyag to the Baku Oil Refinery is to manage two factories from one center. It further announced in 2017 that the refinery will undergo a considerable renovation, so that 75-80% of the equipment would be replaced by 2020. The main goal of the renovation is to make the produced gasoline compatible with the Euro5 standard.  Current data  In 2006, this entity has produced a quantity of oil which match Azerbaijan's export and internal needs. 37,9% out of overall production has been exported and 41,4% was converted into motor fuel. Nowadays 45.5% percent of overall production is exported to other countries.  International cooperation  In October 2015, Socar signed a contract with Poerner for construction of bitumen plant. In 2016, the detailed unit of bitumen unit was designed. Also in 2016 Socar signed an agreement with Air Liquide on the construction of hydrogen production plant. In 2017, a new contract between the refinery and Tecnicas Reunidas was signed on the reconstruction of installations. Tecnimont and Kinetics Technology also joined the project on reconstruction and modernization in 2018 and proposed to build 10 installations. After reconstruction estimate growth of oil production would be 7.5 million tons of oil per year.

The church was designed by Edmund Blacket and built between 1863 and 1864. The building is also notable due its pipe organ, designed and built by August Gern. The church complex is also known as St. Mary's Anglican Church and Pipe Organ and Gern Pipe Organ. The property is owned by Waverley Anglican Parish; part of the Anglican Diocese of Sydney. The complex was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History   Waverley  Waverley the suburb's name comes from the book title by Sir Walter Scott, famed Scottish author and poet. It was given thus by Barnett Levey (or Levy, 1798‚Äì1837) who came to Sydney in the 1820s to visit his brother. Seeing how prosperous the city was he settled and set up business in George Street as a general merchant. He was influential in bringing theatre to Australia, establishing the Theatre Royal in part of his building off George Street. In 1831 he was granted a piece of land in the area of today's Waverley, bounded by Old South Head Road, Birrell Street, Hollywood Avenue and Paul Street. He built a substantial two-storey home on Old South Head Road in 1827, naming it Waverley House after the novel of that name. In 1837 Waverley House was taken over for a Catholic school or orphanage. It was demolished in the early 20th century.Pollen & Healy, 1988, 266 In 1857 a small stone church was built in Church Street, Waverley for the local Anglican congregation, now the site of St Clare's College, Waverley.LEP, 1996 It was soon found to be inadequate and the construction of the present building commenced with the laying of its foundation stone on 6 June 1863. It was built on a site donated by T. D. Edwards, that was part of original grant to Barnett Levey. The building was consecrated on 19 May 1864 by Bishop Barker. The church was built by W. Bailey. The original design envisaged a tower and spire, which were never built. Porches and the organ chamber were added in 1872. In the 1870s it was extended by to its present size. The church was designed in the Ecclesiastical Gothic Revival style by Edmund Blacket, a prominent Australian architect of the Victorian era. The stained glass windows are some of the earliest to be made in the colony, the two in the first bay of the south wall of the nave being the earliest windows to be commissioned in New South Wales. In 1888 the pipe organ was added. The Church is listed on the now defunct Register of the National Estate, Waverley Local Environmental Plan and the NSW State Heritage Register and extensive restoration to the fabric of the building has taken place since the 1980s. In 1993 a gallery was added and the organ relocated.  Description   Grounds  Sited on the highest point in Waverley, the group is a visually prominent feature of the streetscape, derived mainly from the stone church and wide frontage to Birrell and Council Streets.Edwards Planning, 2015. Grey sandstone wall along Birrell Street frontage (possibly ) together with mature landscape elements, Canary Island date palms, are significant visible elements. Existing plantings fronting Birrell Street provide a dense visual screen. The church and hall are set in attractive garden surrounds. It appears little of the original landscape features remain from the Victorian period. Possibly the driveway layout is original (now concreted). An impressive grey sandstone wall along Birrell Street frontage exists, possibly from . The bank of hydrangea (H.macrophylla cv.) shrubs along the southern wall of the church probably dates from the same period. There are mature Canary island date palms (Phoenix canariensis), near the adjacent former Church Hall and within the grounds. These are notable landscape elements to about high, dating probably from . Other mature plantings include Lord Howe Island palm (Howea fosteriana), low hedging of box (Buxus sp.).Stuart Read, pers.comm., 24 July 2015. The central lawn is of buffalo grass. Traditional central and edge bordering flower beds punctuate the lawn. A columbabium () exists on the north side of the church, screened by a mature cypress (Cupressus sp.) possibly from .

Althea comes down with a fever, and tells June there is antibiotics in her truck. June goes by herself to track down the truck, and retrieves it after an altercation with Quinn, the man who stole it. However, the truck is out of fuel. June cannot find the medicine, and Althea reveals over the radio that there wasn't any; she just wanted the truck back with her videotapes. June luckily finds medicine in an overturned bus near the truck. Morgan unknowingly encounters the mysterious woman at a supply box, and after he leaves, she replaces the bottles of clean water with dirty water. At higher ground, Morgan obtains a signal and gives his location. June and Althea hear the message and reunite with Morgan. Quinn, who has found fuel, is attacked and killed by Purvis, the Infected companion of the mysterious woman. She leaves Purvis behind and watches Quinn reanimate.

The current Timber School House was designed in Mission Revival architectural style by Roy C. Wilson, Ventura County‚Äôs first licensed architect. It is the former site of Conejo Valley High School which moved following the site's 2015 sale to Daylight Thousand Oaks, LLC, a developer, for $8.9 million.

History The 1888 bell is housed at Cypress Elementary School. Until its establishment in 1889, students of Timberville (now Newbury Park, California) attended classes at the Grand Union Hotel, located a few hundred yards east from the schoolhouse.Bidwell, Carol A. (1989). The Conejo Valley: Old and New Frontiers. Windsor Publications. Pages 28,32,34 and 65. . The school drew its student body mainly from Newbury Park farms, and children reached the school on foot, horseback or by wagon.O‚ÄôBrien, Tricia (2017). Thousand Oaks and Westlake Village (Images of America). Arcadia Publishing. Page 16. . It was originally constructed on land which belonged to Cecil Arthur Entwisle Haigh, the owner of the Grand Union Hotel. In December 1888, Haigh sold two acres of his land for a new school, at the present day corner of Kelley and Newbury Roads. The school had one large classroom and two smaller rooms used as cloakrooms. The school was equipped with slate blackboards and coal oil lamps. The schoolhouse was also used for church services. A wood stove provided heat. Miss Moster, the school‚Äôs first teacher, taught approximately 35 students and was paid $40 per month.Sprankling, Miriam (2002). Discovering the Story of The Conejo Valley. Newbury Park, CA: Conejo Valley Historical Society. Page 57. . Besides being used for educational purposes and church services, the school was utilized for May Day celebrations, wedding ceremonies, and picnics. The original school was condemned in 1921, and the Timber School Board of Trustees searched for funds to construct a bigger schoolhouse. Distinguished architect Roy C. Wilson of Santa Paula was selected to design the new structure. The new school, constructed in concrete, was completed in the fall of 1924. The original Timber School, located right behind the new one, was demolished and sold as lumber in 1925. As the population of the valley continued to grow, additional classrooms were needed and an auditorium was constructed in 1949. In July 1974, Timber School District joined with nearby school districts to form the Conejo Valley Unified School District. The Timber School has been used for district offices and later the Conejo Valley continuation high school, Conejo Valley High School. Currently, it is vacant, awaiting planned development. In the meantime, it has attracted vandalism and needed to be boarded up following an Fire Protection District inspection that yielded four fire code violations. On July 13, 2004, the Thousand Oaks City Council voted unanimously to make the Timber School City Landmark No. 12. A replica of the original 1889 school was completed in 1994 and is located at the grounds of the Stagecoach Inn Museum.Begun, Ruthanne and Miriam Sprankling (2004). A Visit to the Historic Stagecoach Inn Museum. Newbury Park, CA: Conejo Valley Historical Society. Page 10. .  Redevelopment Plans and Controversy  In 2015, the developer Daylight Thousand Oaks LLC purchased the 10-acre site from Conejo Valley Unified School District for $8.9 million. After submitted and withdrawing a plan containing \\"two hotels and restaurants\\", the developer submitted a plan containing 210 apartments (26 designated affordable) and a 120-room hotel in mid 2019 and won pre-approval and residential unit allocation under 1996's Measure E (which restricts the area's growth by establishing a maximum number of buildable units) from the Thousand Oaks City Council. The plan incorporates both the schoolhouse and auditorium as administrative offices and community rooms. Council members remarked that the development would provide \\"needed housing\\" and hoped it might be able to lower rents. However, nearby residents have expressed disapproval of the current plan, citing parking issues, view- obstruction, and the project's density. Currently, the developer is in the process of writing and submitting a formal application for the development.

The defending champions Barcelona were eliminated by Porto in the semi-finals. In the final, Sporting CP beat Porto 5‚Äì2 to win their second trophy in the competition, while Porto lost their 10th consecutive final and 12th overall. Team allocation Association ranking For the 2018‚Äì19 Rink Hockey Euroleague, the associations were allocated places according to their coefficient, which takes into account the performance of each association's representative teams in European competitions between the 2014‚Äì15 and the 2017‚Äì18 seasons. The coefficient is calculated by dividing the total of points accumulated by the number of participating teams. Participation is reserved to teams from associations that have an effective capacity to organise annually their own national championships. They will all have at least one team entering the competition. To allocate the other nine places, the D'Hondt method was applied to the coefficient of each association. In case of withdrawals, priority would be given according to the order established by the D'Hondt method. {  - !Rank !Association !Coefficient !Teams !colspan=4D'Hondt points - !1  Portugal align=right19.903 align=center4 align=right bgcolor=#BBF3BB9.952  align=right bgcolor=#BBF3BB6.634  align=right bgcolor=#BBF3BB4.976 - !2  Spain align=right19.472 align=center4 align=right bgcolor=#BBF3BB9.736  align=right bgcolor=#BBF3BB6.491  align=right bgcolor=#BBF3BB4.868 - !3  Italy align=right15.588 align=center3 align=right bgcolor=#BBF3BB7.794  align=right bgcolor=#BBF3BB5.196  align=right3.897 - !4  France align=right9.292 align=center2 align=right bgcolor=#BBF3BB4.646  align=right3.097  align=right2.323 - !5  Germany align=right6.000 align=center1 align=right3.000  align=right2.000  align=right1.500 - !6  Switzerland align=right5.958 align=center1 align=right2.979  align=right1.986  align=right1.490 - !7  England align=right3.000 align=center1 align=right1.500  align=right1.000  align=right0.750 } Teams League positions of the previous season shown in parentheses (TH: Title holders).

It has a single small, smooth leaf with wavy edges and a pale red lower surface, and up to three greenish and white flowers with red or mauve markings. It is distinguished from the other subspecies by the colour of the lower surface of its leaf and by its later flowering period. Description Eriochilus dilatatus subsp. brevifolius is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and a single smooth leaf, long, wide. The leaf has a pale red lower surface and wavy edges. Up to three flowers long and wide are borne on a flowering stem tall. The flowers are greenish with reddish markings, except for the lateral sepals which are white. The labellum is prominently down-curved and has three lobes with scattered clusters of red and white hairs. Flowering occurs from March to June. Taxonomy and naming The blunt-leaved bunny orchid was first formally described in 2006 by Stephen Hopper and Andrew Brown from a specimen collected near the Murchison River. The subspecies epithet (brevifolius) is derived from the Latin words brevis meaning \\"short\\" and folium meaning \\"leaf\\". Distribution and habitat The blunt-leaved bunny orchid grows in scrub and mallee-heath between Cataby and the Murchison River in the Geraldton Sandplains and Yalgoo biogeographic regions. Conservation Eriochilus dilatatus subsp. brevifolius is classified as \\"not threatened\\" by the Western Australian Government Department of Parks and Wildlife.

A wire suspension bridge hosted rails to allow the transfer of goods from the factory to the mill on trollies. 1886 birds-eye view of Kauri Timber Co The Kauri Timber Company, Limited, (KTC) Auckland was from 1888 to 1944 a large logging and sawmilling company in New Zealand. KTC was formed in 1888, with a capital of ¬£1,250,000, paid up to ¬£750,000, and its operations were of a very comprehensive nature. Besides KTC's headquarters in Melbourne and a branch in Sydney, there were sixteen branches in New Zealand, where the timber was milled. The forests owned by KTC made it the fifth- largest landholding company in the country, which removed much of North Island‚Äôs native forest, initially kauri and later kahikatea, assuring steady supplies for its mills for many years. Between 300 and 400 men were engaged in the Auckland mill and factory, and throughout the whole of the company's operations in mills, stores, and forests, some 5000 or 6000 people were employed. In its extensive export trade the company employed a large fleet of vessels, and was represented in the markets of Great Britain, Cape Colony, Australia and the South Sea Islands.Kauri Timber Company.

The Auckland mill burnt down in 1942 and a new yard opened in Penrose in 1944. The 4-storey office at 104 Fanshawe St, which had been opened in 1882 by KTC's predecessor, Auckland Timber Co, and is now a Category 1 listed building, was sold to Austral Super Paint Ltd and a single storey office opened in the new yard. KTC was hit by 'the Menzies bloody Credit Squeeze' mini-budget in 1961 and invited Fletcher Holdings to buy KTC's New Zealand assets. First the Christchurch plywood factory, Butler Bros, Stuart & Chapman and Ellis & Burnand were sold on 5 June 1961 for NZ¬£750,000 (A¬£930,000), though they were said to be worth well in excess of ¬£1 million. KTC's other New Zealand assets were sold to Fletcher for ¬£1.6 million later in the year. KTC's customers and senior staff were not happy with the take over, causing profitability to drop.

She is known for her semi-autobiographical drawing and printmaking series \\"Cutie & Bullie\\". She has had several international gallery and museum exhibitions including in Tokyo, New York City, Dallas, Krak√≥w, Ottawa and more. Shinohara and her husband, Ushio, are the subjects of a documentary film by Zachary Heinzerling called Cutie and the Boxer (2013).  Biography  Shinohara moved to New York City at the age of 19, in the early 1970s, in order to study art at the Art Students League of New York. A few months after arriving to the city, she met the artist Ushio who was 21 years her senior. Within the next couple years they were married and together they had a son born in 1974, Alexander K≈´kai Shinohara. Their tumultuous life together as a family was subject to the Zachary Heinzerling directed, 2013 documentary, Cutie and the Boxer. The nickname \\"Cutie\\" started in 2002 at the age of 49, when Shinohara was wearing her hair in two braids and a young man on the street called out to her, \\"hey cutie\\". The nickname stuck after that event. She started creating the drawing series after complaining about her husband to a friend, who quipped back at her, that she should \\"punish him\\" as a dominatrix would do. Finding this idea amusing, in 2003-2004 she started drawing images of Cutie punishing Bullie and sending them to her friend that had made the joke. Initially only Cutie was named in the drawings and it was formatted as six-frame comics, but by 2007 she named Bullie, and slowly it became a story about both Cutie and Bullie. In 1986, she held her first solo exhibition at Cat's Club in New York City. In 2016, she held her first solo exhibition in a museum at Carlton University Art Gallery in Ottawa, Canada,  References  Category:1953 births Category:Artists from Brooklyn Category:Manga artists Category:American female comics artists Category:Women manga artists Category:American women of Japanese descent Category:Living people Category:Japanese contemporary artists Category:People from Toyama Prefecture Category:Japanese emigrants to the United States ","title":"Noriko Shinohara"},{"id":"57898964","text":"Kevin Bowe is a songwriter, record producer and musician from Minneapolis. He is most well known for his work with prominent rock and blues artists including Paul Westerberg and the Replacements, writing songs for hit albums by Jonny Lang and Kenny Wayne Shepherd, as well as Etta James' Grammy-winning Let's Roll. He has contributed to dozens of albums over his career, including several of his own as a bandleader, and has appeared on many film and television soundtracks including ESPN and The Sopranos. His songs have been covered by many prominent rock and blues artists, including Joe Cocker, Lynyrd Skynyrd, Robben Ford, and John Mayall.  Career  After growing up in rural Minnesota, Bowe became part of the burgeoning rock scene in early 1980s Minneapolis that spawned H√ºsker D√º and The Replacements, fronting alternative rock and Americana bands including The Dads, Summer of Love and The Revelators. His career began to launch when his Revelators song \\"Riverside\\" was covered by Kenny Wayne Shepherd on his platinum-selling album Ledbetter Heights, which led to a songwriting contract with rock legends Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller in 1997. Bowe discovered blues guitarist Jonny Lang, then still a teenager, at a blues jam in Fargo, North Dakota, and contributed songs for Lang's breakthrough hit albums Lie To Me in 1997 and the Grammy-nominated Wander This World in 1998. The following year, Bowe began to move into producing with the debut from another teenage blues guitarist, Shannon Curfman's Loud Guitars, Big Suspicions. Bowe's most famous work has been as a songwriter for other artists. He co-wrote four songs on Etta James‚Äô 2003 Grammy-winning album Let's Roll, including \\"The Blues Is My Business,\\" which was later covered by E Street Band guitarist Little Steven Van Zandt on his solo record Soulfire. Other notable songs include \\"Sault Ste. Marie\\", covered by Three Dog Night, and Lynyrd Skynyrd's \\"Dead Man Walkin'\\" (co-written with the band) on the 2003 album Vicious Cycle. Bowe has a longstanding friendship and working relationship with Replacements frontman Paul Westerberg, having begun as contemporaries starting out in the Minneapolis music scene. (Bowe's band The Dads were the headliners at the earliest known recorded live performance of the Replacements, at Minneapolis club Jay's Longhorn Bar in July 1980.) He played guitar in Westerberg's solo touring band His Only Friends in the early 2000s, and joined the Replacements in 2012 to record the six-song EP Songs for Slim. (The band also recorded at Bowe's home studio around that time, though none of the material from those sessions has yet been released.) Besides Westerberg, Bowe (often with his band Okemah Prophets) has also frequently been a touring or live backing musician for Freedy Johnston and the Jayhawks' Gary Louris. Bowe has also produced records by several notable Minneapolis bands, including indie-folk band Communist Daughter's 2016 album, The Cracks That Built the Wall and punk group Suicide Commandos' comeback album Time Bomb.  As primary performer  Bowe has released five albums with his roots-rock band the Okemah Prophets, most recently Every Part of the Buffalo. 2012's Natchez Trace included a song co-written with Westerberg, \\"Everybody Lies,\\" and guest performances by Westerberg, the Meat Puppets, Wilco guitarist Nels Cline, Communist Daughter's Johnny Solomon and Molly Moore, Jayhawks drummer Tim O'Reagan, Freedy Johnston, Chuck Prophet, Phil Solem of the Rembrandts, and Bob Dylan violinist Scarlet Rivera (The band is named after folk singer Woody Guthrie's birthplace, Okemah, Oklahoma.) The band has received critical praise for Bowe's songwriting, which No Depression magazine called \\"criminally catchy.\\"  Personal life  Bowe also teaches music and audio production at Minneapolis' Institute of Production & Recording. His wife, Ruth Whitney Bowe, founded Minneapolis nightclub Fine Line Music Cafe in 1987 and owned it until 1990. (The couple began dating shortly after Bowe performed at the club around the time of its opening.) She would later be asked by Prince to help him open another club in downtown Minneapolis, Glam Slam.

Design The left laminar flow wing section Natural laminar flow is opposed to hybrid laminar flow artificially induced through hardware. It is difficult to industrialise a wing smooth enough to sustain the laminar flow in operation, but having very low design and manufacturing tolerances, leading-edge retractable slats, and fasteners, that is aerodynamically robust enough, and can withstand surface deformations and dirt, de-icing fluid, and rain-droplet contamination. The metallic outboard section with a carbon fiber reinforced plastic upper laminar flow surface is isolated from the rest of the wing and has two ailerons on each side. Its wing sweep is around 20¬∞ for a Mach 0.75 cruise, instead of 30¬∞ for a Mach 0.82‚Äì0.84 cruise. Laminar flow is expected along 50% of chord length instead of just aft of the leading edge, halving the wing friction drag, reducing the overall aircraft drag by 8% and saving up to 5% in fuel on an 800nm (1,480km) sector. Development The A340 flight demonstrator The demonstrator took off on 26 September, 2017. In April 2018, after 66 flight hours, drag reduction is better than expected at 10% and laminar flow is more stable than anticipated, including when the wing twists and flexes. Both wings with their carbon fibre upper sustainably generate the desired effect, while the carbon fibre left wing leading edge and metallic right wing leading edge have small differences in aerodynamic effects. The aerodynamic benefits could be sustained at Mach 0.78 up from Mach 0.75 and next-generation single-aisles could use from the late 2020s. Tests will continue until 2019 and will include wing contamination and a fixed Kr√ºger flap. Morphing flaps should be flight tested from May 2020.

He was the son of renowned politician Bashir Ahmed Bilour. He was killed in a suicide bombing during a party meeting in Peshawar on 10 July 2018. Biography Bilour was a barrister, and he joined politics following the footsteps of his father Bashir Ahmed Bilour. Haroon Bilour and his father were both candidates for the PK-78 constituency for the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Assembly. Bilour and his brother Usman Bashir Bilour contested assembly elections in 2002 and 2008 and lost. Haroon Bilour was once elected as Nazim of Town-1 Peshawar. In 2007, Bilour, his brother, his father and his uncle were nominated in a case involving the killing of two members of an adversary family. Hostilities emerged between the families back in 1997, when the only son of Bilour's uncle was shot dead at a polling station during by- election on a National Assembly seat. In 2011, a group of elders brought an end to the family dispute at the advice of then-President Asif Ali Zardari. On 11 October 2013, the Peshawar High Court confirmed pre-arrest bail for Bilour and his uncle Ghulam Ahmad Bilour, a Member of the National Assembly, who were earlier accused of vandalising a women polling station during the 22 August by-elections in NA-1. In 2016, Bilour's security guards allegedly assaulted a Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) worker. Bilour also had a case registered against the PTI worker, claiming that the PTI worker had aimed a gun at him before Bilour's security guards protected him. In June 2018, Bilour opposed the Town-1 Peshawar administration's ban on the display of election posters and banners on historic gates of the city, on the conserved city wall and on the Gorkhatri Archaeological Complex. He argued the code of conduct about the display of flags and banners was the jurisdiction of the Election Commission of Pakistan. Personal life Haroon Bilour's brother Usman did not participate in politics and died of a cardiac arrest in December 2014. Bilour's wife is daughter of former minister of Sindh, Irfanullah Khan Marwat, and grand daughter of former President of Pakistan, late Ghulam Ishaq Khan. Haroon Bilour's son Danyal was 21 at the time of Haroon's death.  Attacks by TTP  Awami National Party (ANP) was the main target in General Election 2013, and hundreds of party supporters were killed. Several months ahead of the election, Bilour's father was killed by a suicide bomber while he was moving towards his home after attending a party meeting in Peshawar. Tehreek- i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) claimed responsibility for the attack. Bilour survived two suicide attacks targeted at him. In April 2013, a suicide attack claimed by TTP on an ANP election rally that targeted Bilour and his uncle killed 18 other people. However, Haroon Bilour was not present at the rally. Haroon Bilour's uncle MNA Ghulam Bilour was attacked by bomb in 2013, as his SUV pulled up to a Peshawar guesthouse for a rally. Haroon Bilour was headed to the site, but stopped his car about away to chat with a friend. Supporters pulled his uncle out of the car seconds before it caught fire. Fearing a low election turnout because of the attacks on the ANP, Bilour said that the Election Commission of Pakistan \\"should ensure that security is provided for voters so they can cast their ballot without fear\\". In 2017, Bilour said that he was \\"proud of the sacrifices the people, police and armed forces have rendered for the cause of peace\\". Death Bilour and 21 others were killed in a suicide bombing by Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan, a terrorist group in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, during his campaign rally in Peshawar for the 2018 Khyber Pakhtunkhwa provincial election. On late night 10 July 2018, Haroon Bilour arrived at Yakatoot area in Peshawar where ANP workers had gathered for a corner meeting. As his vehicle arrived, a loud explosion occurred. Bilour suffered serious injuries and was shifted to hospital where he succumbed to his wounds. Bilour's body was shifted to his residence at Bilour House. ANP supporters gathered outside his residence and shouted slogans against government for his \\"failure to provide security\\". Following the incident, the Election Commission of Pakistan postponed the polls for PK-78, constituency from which Bilour was to contest election. Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan later claimed the responsibility that they had targeted the party meeting which killed Bilour. Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan termed this target a revenge of Operation Rah-e-Haq, which was carried out when Awami National Party was the ruling party in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. TTP also warned the security forces of more attacks. Funeral Thousands of people from different walks of life attended the funeral of Bilour in Peshawar. According to a senior police officer, about 30,000 people attended the funeral of slain ANP leader. Over 500 police personnel were deployed for funeral security of slain leader and bomb disposal squad was also called to clear the route from Bilour's house to the funeral ground.

He is the incumbent Member of Parliament for Temerloh constituency in the state of Pahang. He is formerly serving as Deputy Minister of Works for the Malaysian government. Educations Mohd Anuar was born in 1952 at Beseri, Perlis, received his early education at Sekolah Kebangsaan (SK) Beseri. He studied and graduated his bachelor's degree in Business Administration at MARA Institute of Technology (ITM). He later obtained his master's degree in Sociology at Morehead State University, United States (1985-1986). During his time as a student at ITM, Mohd Anuar started involving in youth Non-governmental organizations (NGO) like Muslim Youth Movement of Malaysia (ABIM) and others. Politics Mohd Anuar was a United Malays National Organisation (UMNO) before quits following dismissal of Anwar Ibrahim from the party in 1998. He was then appointed as the first secretary general of People's Justice Party (KeADILan) in 1999, but somehow he shifted by joining Pan-Malaysian Islamic Party (PAS) in 2003 and was selected as a Central Working Committee member of PAS. However Mohd Anuar was one of the moderate and progressive PAS leaders referred to as G18 who were ousted at the 2015 PAS leadership election that led them to launch the new splinter party, AMANAH with Mohd Anuar as its first secretary general. Elections Mohd Anuar made his debut contesting in the 1999 general election as a KeADILan candidate the parliamentary seat of Padang Besar, Perlis. He also contested before the Perlis State Legislative Assembly seats of Beseri in the 2004 general election, Bintong in the 2008 general election and Santan in the 2013 general election representing PAS. But he lost in all his attempts until he contested and won in the 2018 general election the parliamentary seat of Temerloh in Pahang as an AMANAH candidate.

It should not be confused with the Muthuraja caste and has been borne by persons from various communities. For example, there was one Virarajendra Brahmadhiraya Muttaraiyan and Vikramasola Brahmadiraya Muttaraiyan who were feudatories of Kulothunga Chola III. These two vassals were not Muthuraja chiefs as the word Brahmadiraya meant Brahmin chiefs only. There was another Brahmadiraya Muttaraiyan who was the elder brother of VƒÅnaVidyadhara-nƒÅdƒÅlvan during the time of Kulottunga II. The latter had built a temple called Kulottunga Choleeswara. During the reign of Rajaraja Chola III around 1243 AD, there was an officer called Mallan Sivan alias Brahmadaraya Muttaraiyan, referred to as pillai (son). He was the holder of the royal fief (arasukuru) and the governor of Urattur-nadu. During the reign of Rajaraja Chola I, the head of the elephant corps was Srutiman Nakkan Chandiran alias Rajamalla Muttaraiyan.

Description Eriochilus dilatatus subsp. magnus is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and a single smooth, flattened, broad egg-shaped leaf, long and wide with flat edges. Up to twenty five flowers long and wide are borne on a flowering stem tall. The flowers are dull green with red markings, except for the lateral sepals which are white. The labellum has three lobes, scattered clusters of red and white hairs and is prominently curved downwards. Flowering occurs from April to May. Taxonomy and naming Eriochilus dilatatus subsp. magnus was first formally described in 2006 by Stephen Hopper and Andrew Brown from a specimen collected in the Warren National Park and the description was published in Nuytsia. The specific epithet (magnus) is a Latin word meaning \\"large\\", referring to the large leaf and tall habit of this subspecies.

Early life and education Grassle was born in Cleveland, Ohio to parents John Kendall and Norah Iris (Fleck) Grassle. He graduated from Bay Village High School in 1957 and went on to study Zoology at Yale University, receiving his degree in 1961; his studies included a summer internship at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI) which led to his lifelong interest in oceanography and marine biology. He then studied for his doctorate at Duke University, receiving his Ph.D. in 1967 for a study entitled \\"Influence of environmental variation on species diversity in benthic communities on the Continental shelf and slope\\".cited in Davies, T. T. 1973. Effect of environmental gradients in the Rappahannock River Estuary on the Molluscan Fauna. Pp. 263-290 in Nelson, B. W. 1973. Environmental Framework of Coastal Plain Estuaries. Geological Society of America, Memoir 133. (p. 272, 289) He received a Fulbright Fellowship which he took up at the University of Queensland in Australia, studying animal succession on the reef crest at Heron Island on the Great Barrier Reef. Career In 1969, Grassle joined WHOI full time as an Assistant Scientist, working initially with Howard Sanders on deep-sea biodiversity. In 1977 he participated in the first biological expedition to survey the recently discovered hydrothermal vents at the Galapagos Rift, and contributed to the understanding of these unique ecosystems which are fueled by chemical energy from the Earth's interior rather than by sunlight. This expedition was documented in the National Geographic Society's documentary \\"Dive to the Edge of Creation\\". He remained with WHOI for 20 years, rising to the position of Senior Scientist, before moving to Rutgers University in New Jersey in 1989 where he would spend the remainder of his career. In his position at Rutgers, Grassle served as founding director that university's then new (1987) Institute of Marine and Coastal Sciences (IMCS), where his work focused on near-shore continental shelf communities and the continued development of ocean observing systems, including an early cabled marine observing system deployed in 15 meters of water, the LEO-15 Long-term Ecosystem Observatory, that could be remotely monitored from Rutgers. He was best known for his deep-sea work, where he brought submersibles to the forefront as a sampling tool, brought experimental manipulative studies to the previously descriptive discipline of deep-sea benthic ecology, and generated debate in marine biodiversity with the first quantitative estimate of global deep-sea diversity.J. Frederick Grassle and Nancy J. Maciolek. 1992. \\"Deep-sea species richness: regional and local diversity estimates from quantitative bottom samples.\\" The American Naturalist 139: 313-341. In 1996 he proposed the idea for a \\"Census of Marine Life\\" (initially entitled the \\"Census of the Fishes\\") to Jesse Ausubel of the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation and in 1997, hosted a \\"Census of the Benthos Workshop\\" at the Rutgers Institute of Marine and Coastal Sciences, part of a series initiated by Ausubel and the Foundation which eventually led to the formal commencement of the Census of Marine Life in 2000.Jesse H.

He also conceived the first effort to integrate marine biological data on a global scale over the internet, the Ocean Biogeographic Information System (OBIS), which was adopted as the database for the Census, and continues to the present under the auspices of the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission. He served as the inaugural chair of the international Scientific Steering Committee for the Census of Marine Life from 2000-2008,Census of Marine Life: Scientific Steering Committee as Director of the OBIS Secretariat while this was based at Rutgers up until 2011, and also on the Steering Committee of the U.S. Global Ocean Observing System from 2001-2006. Grassle retired in 2012 after 23 years of service to Rutgers University; his career to 2009 was summarized in a paper by Paul Snelgrove et al. in the journal Deep-Sea Research.Paul V.R.

In sports, particularly team sports, the player name, often referred to as the uniform name, squad name, jersey name, shirt name is the name worn on a player's uniform. Originally, the number worn on a player's uniform was used to identify and distinguish each players (and sometimes others, such as coaches and officials) from others wearing the same or similar uniforms. Generally, a surname is used, but a nickname is also common. The name is typically displayed on the rear of the jersey, often accompanied by the number. Name printing is also used from a sports marketing point, such as to promote the player to fans and jersey sales. Association football In association football, In 1954 FIFA World Cup, numbers were introduced on the back of team jerseys. In 1994 FIFA World Cup, FIFA made changes to the jersey, adding squad numbers to the front in addition to the back and adding player names to the back of the jerseys for the first time. These modifications were implemented to make it easier for television and radio broadcasters to identify players.FIFA World Football Museum: USA '94: A World Cup of firsts In UEFA Euro 1992 and 1993‚Äì94 FA Premier League, names on jerseys were also used, but after 1994 FIFA World Cup, they became more commonly used in various football competitions worldwide. Baseball In Major League Baseball, uniform numbers were not introduced until 1929 by the New York Yankees; names on uniforms were introduced in 1960s.1968 World Series Highlights Despite introducing numbers to professional baseball, however, the current Yankees uniform do not have player names printing because of team tradition and philosophy, arguing that baseball is a team sport and not having player names emphasizes the value the importance of teamwork and unity over individual stardom.Why No Player Names on Yankee Uniforms? Gridiron football In gridiron football, which includes American football and Canadian football, names on jerseys are used frequently and are mandatory in current professional play. In college football and high school football, where team rosters are often in excess of one hundred players, there may be multiple players with the same uniform number; player names help with disambiguation between the players. Some schools may choose not to print player names on uniforms either for financial or philosophical reasons; Penn State and Notre Dame are examples of the latter.SportsRec: \\"Why No Names on Jerseys in College Football?\\" The original 2001 incarnation of the XFL infamously allowed players to replace their surnames with a nickname of their choosing; the most well-known of these was Rod Smart who chose to put the phrase \\"He Hate Me\\" on his uniform.[https://www.sportscasting.com/what- happened-to-xfl-star-he-hate-me-rod-smart/ Sportscasting.com: \\"What Happened to XFL Star 'He Hate Me' Rod Smart?\\" In 2018, players at Temple were allowed to replace their surnames with their Twitter account handles for their annual spring game as a promotional stunt.[https://www.cbssports.com/college- football/news/look-temple-puts-twitter-handles-of-players-on-football-jerseys- for-spring-game/ CBS Sports: \\"LOOK: Temple puts Twitter handles of players on football jerseys for spring game\\" Ice hockey At the start of the 1977‚Äì78 season, the National Hockey League (NHL) placed into effect a rule that also required players' sweaters to display the names of the players wearing them in addition to their number, but Toronto Maple Leafs owner Harold Ballard initially refused to follow the new rule, fearing that he would not be able to sell programs at his team's games. The NHL responded by threatening to levy a fine on the team in February 1978, so Ballard complied by making the letters the same color as the background they were on, which for the team's road jerseys was blue. The NHL threatened further sanctions, and despite playing more than one game with their \\"unreadable\\" sweaters, Ballard's Maple Leafs finally complied in earnest by making the blue jerseys' letters white.

It's located south of Mount Rainier within Mount Rainier National Park. The mountain's name \\"Chutla\\" derives from Chinook Jargon which means \\"rock\\". Precipitation runoff on the peak drains into the Nisqually River. Climate Chutla Peak is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range (Orographic lift), causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades. As a result, the west side of the North Cascades experiences high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. Due to its temperate climate and proximity to the Pacific Ocean, areas west of the Cascade Crest very rarely experience temperatures below or above . During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer. Because of maritime influence, snow tends to be wet and heavy, resulting in high avalanche danger.

Location and history  In 1880 John Rochfort surveyed the route of the line. The cost was ¬£1350 per mile. The public endorsed the proposal of the millers and the Takaka Road Board to lay a tramline. The government contributed rails and ¬£2000 towards the project. Another ¬£4000 had to be borrowed. Construction began in February 1881, with the track being of gauge with light 22 lb/yard (11 kg/m) rails. The line ran from Waitapu Wharf on the coast, south to TƒÅkaka township via Commercial Street. From there, alongside the TƒÅkaka River at Paynes Ford (on a raised embankment between the TƒÅkaka River and high limestone bluffs) through private land on the plains to join East Takaka Road, then met Loop Road and ended at East TƒÅkaka, for a total distance of . After the inauguration of the tramway in 1882, the steam locomotive Pioneer ran twice daily with a passenger carriage and two to three truckloads of timber between East TƒÅkaka and the port. The tramway was mainly used for transporting goods and timber to Waitapu for export. By 1905 this traffic had mostly disappeared and the tramway was put up for sale and removed in 1906. Only one locomotive was used on the line, an 0-4-0T named \\"Pioneer\\", built at Anchor Foundry in Nelson. It arrived at Waitapu Wharf on 3 June 1882, had cylinders by with diameter wheels. In the mid 1890s, the Takaka Tramway Company came into financial problems due to the decline of the timber industry. The ownership changed hands several times. Serious flooding in 1904 virtually destroyed the track of the tramway. In 1905 the locomotive, rolling stock and rails were sold to a Wellington-based company. After the tramway closed, \\"Pioneer\\" was last noted as being in an Auckland scrap yard.

The palace is now transformed into a museum. The palace complex has an area of about 32,000 square meters consisting of 4 palaces namely Istana Siak, Istana Lima, Istana Padjang, and Istana Baru. Each of the palace including Siak Palace itself has an area of 1,000 square meters. History The Moorish-style palace, which is now a museum located 120 kilometres (75 mi) upstream of the Siak river in Pekanbaru was built by the 11th sultan, Syarif Hasyim Abdul Jalil Syarifuddin of Sultanate of Siak Sri Indrapura in 1889. The architecture of the palace has European influences that blend harmoniously with the Malay and Moorish elements. Before constructing the palace the Sultan traveled Netherlands and Germany, even some of the furniture was brought from Europe. There is a myth related with the foundation. It is said that while the Sultan and his dignitaries were discussing the project, suddenly appeared a white dragon on the surface of the river Siak. The presence of the dragon was interpreted as a sign of blessing of the project and auspicious for the greatness of the kingdom. To immortalize the dragon, the Sultan made it the official emblem of the kingdom. The pillars of the palace were decorated with ornaments in the form of dragons. The palace contains royal ceremonial objects, such as a gold- plated crown set with diamonds, a golden throne and personal objects of Sultan Syarif Qasyim and his wife, such as the \\"Komet\\", a multi-centennial musical instrument which is said to have been made only two copies in the world. Komet still works, and is used to play works by composers such as Beethoven, Mozart and Strauss. Siak Palace has Malay , Arabic and European architecture. The building consists of two floors. The lower floor is divided into six courtrooms: The guest lounge, the living room of honor, the male living room, the living room for women, one room on the right is the courtroom, also used for the party room. The upper floor is divided into nine rooms, serves to rest the Sultan as well as the guests of the palace. At the top of the building there are six eagle statues as a symbol of courage. While on the court yard can still be seen eight cannons spread to various sides of the palace yard, then on the left rear of the palace there is a small building that was used as a temporary prison . A courtroom, the \\"Balairung Sari\\" (the flower room) and royal cemetery also part of palace complex.

It was situated on a foot crossing between Manderville Road and Old Stoke Road. In 1966, British Rail proposed the closure of the station which was queried by the East Midlands Transport Users Consultative Committee (TUCC) as usage figures showed that receipts were ¬£130 per year while direct costs were only ¬£26. British Rail subsequently justified the closure on the basis of anticipated renewal costs of ¬£2,500 and the TUCC approved the closure, as there would be no hardship caused. The station closed on 5 June 1967. Present day Pedestrian access across the railway was maintained at the station site until a fatality in November 2016 when a cyclist was killed. The crossing has since been closed.

Aiming to be the biggest OPM gathering in the Philippines, the festival consists of more than 120 OPM acts in different genres, particularly from rock, hip hop, and indie among others. Held in every first quarter of the year, Rakrakan Festival entertains its attendees with not only just live music, but also a purely local merchandise bazaar, food stalls, skateboarding exhibitions, live art installations and exhibitions, and more.About Rakrakan Festival History 2013 Starting off with only 50 bands, Rakrakan Festival 2013 with the theme ‚ÄúRock ‚ÄòTil You Drop\\" kicked off on December 21, 2013 as Rakista Radio ambitioned the rock community to be seen by a wider audience. Two stages‚Äîthe Move and Mosh Stage‚Äîwere set up at the Coral Way Open Parking in Pasay City. Their goal for OPM support was met after an audience estimate of 10,000 attendees. 2014 Following their first successful year of gathering the country‚Äôs music community, they proceeded with Rakrakan Festival 2014 held in the Globe Circuit Events Ground in Makati City. Although maintaining the similar theme ‚ÄúRock ‚ÄòTil You Drop‚Äù, the organizers have expanded the festival‚Äôs amenities by adding 20 more artists and one more stage‚Äînow with a total of 70 bands and three stages: the Move, Mosh, and Groove Stage. 2015/2016 Rakrakan Festival 2015 still bore the same theme, ‚ÄúRock ‚ÄòTil You Drop‚Äù, with the same number of artists and stages, and in the same venue as before. Initially, it was scheduled on December 19, 2015, but due to two simultaneous tropical depressions‚ÄîOnyok and Nona‚Äîwhich hit the country in the same month, Rakrakan Festival 2015 was rescheduled a month later to January 16, 2016. It was also in this year where Rakrakan Festival introduced their first street art exhibition. 2017 OPM Against Drugs was the festival's official theme for 2017 and was held at the Mall of Asia Concert Grounds in Pasay City on January 14, 2017. In this year, Rakrakan Festival leveled up as they have invited 100 local acts and added 2 more stages than the usual: the Indie and Slam Stage. The festival was also attended by notable public officials from the Philippine National Police. However, problems arose just a few days before the event as some of the acts backed out from the lineup due to various reasons, most of which includes a stance against President Rodrigo Duterte's drug war campaign. 2018 Come February 24, 2018, Rakrakan Festival moved to the Aseana City Concert Grounds in Para√±aque City, bearing the theme ‚ÄúPinoy Muna!‚Äù'‚Äîtaking a stand for nationalistic pride. Due to the tremendous amount of attendees in the previous Rakrakan Festivals and the demand for a bigger lineup, the organizing team decided to take one step higher and added 20 more main artists to the roster and one brand-new stage: the Tropa Center Stage, which paved the way for mainstream pop, R&B;, and hiphop artists to be included in what seems to be just branded as a regular rock festival. 2019 Rakrakan Festival 2019 had a different gameplay. The festival was held for two consecutive days, from March 1 to March 2, 2019 at the Globe Circuit Event Grounds in Makati with the theme ‚ÄúPeace, Love, and Music‚Äù. Due to the venue‚Äôs limited space, the 6 stages were split up to 3 stages per day to accommodate the whole weekend. Also, the Groove Stage was also renamed to Peace Stage to be more aligned to the festival theme and to emphasize inclusivity. On Day 1, the Move Stage, Center Stage, and Indie Stage were set up and on the other hand, Day 2 had the Mosh Stage, Slam Stage, and Peace Stage. Also on this year, various non-government organizations were invited and given a chance to speak out their respective advocacies on stage and augment their campaigns on ground. NGOs who participated Rakrakan Festival 2019 were Haribon Foundation, Kreon, and Virlanie Foundation. 2020 Rakrakan Festival 2020, which bears the same theme, ‚ÄúPeace, Love, and Music‚Äù, was supposed to be held on February 29, 2020 at the CCP Open Grounds in Pasay, but on February 16, it was announced that the event is postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Originally, it was rescheduled to April 25, 2020, but it was postponed once again until further notice. Stages Move Stage A staple since the first Rakrakan Festival, the Move Stage includes bands and artists from alternative rock, punk rock, grunge, or pop rock genres. Mosh Stage Another staple since the genesis of Rakrakan Festival, the Mosh Stage consists of alternative metal, metalcore, or post-grunge bands. Groove Stage/Peace Stage Originally named as the Groove Stage and later officially renamed as the Peace Stage on 2019, it is notable for swaying away from the usual heavy rock music as this stage is dedicated to reggae, ska, soul, indie pop, and folk artists. Slam Stage The Slam Stage is the haven for heavy metal, death metal, progressive metal, and metalcore bands. Center Stage To include more artists to the annual roster, Rakrakan Festival finally opened up their doors to pop, R&B;, and hiphop artists thru the Center Stage. Upon introducing this stage, the event had been criticized of including such genres to the lineup due to the branding coming off from the event title itself‚Äî\\"Rakrakan Festival\\", which connotes exclusivity to the rock genre only and its likes. Indie Stage The Indie Stage is also included in the yearly Rakrakan Festival to include artists coming from the broad spectrum of the indie genre, some of which lie under new wave, synth pop, electronic and the like.

It's located south of Mount Rainier, within Mount Rainier National Park, and immediately east of Longmire. Eagle Peak was originally known as Simlayshe, a Native American word meaning eagle. George Longmire anglicized the name to Eagle Peak. The four mile Eagle Peak Trail leads to views of Mount Rainier. The summit of Eagle Peak requires scrambling. Precipitation runoff on the peak drains into the Nisqually River. Climate Eagle Peak is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range (Orographic lift), causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades. As a result, the west side of the North Cascades experiences high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. Due to its temperate climate and proximity to the Pacific Ocean, areas west of the Cascade Crest very rarely experience temperatures below or above . During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer. Because of maritime influence, snow tends to be wet and heavy, resulting in high avalanche danger. The months July through September offer the most favorable weather for viewing or climbing this peak.

He featured in La Liga for Athletic Bilbao but spent most of his playing career in the second and third divisions, including spells with CD M√°laga and Real Betis. In later years he spent time as a technical staff member for clubs including Athletic Bilbao and Real Sociedad. Playing career Athletic Bilbao Born in Barakaldo, Biscay, Basque Country, Quintanilla was a graduate of Athletic Bilbao's youth system. He made his senior debut as a 19-year-old with the reserve team, Bilbao Athletic, in the Segunda Divisi√≥n in October 1983 against Deportivo La Coru√±a, scoring his first goal in the same match. He remained with the reserves for six seasons, enduring some major injuries and experiencing a relegation followed by a promotion, while also making occasional appearances for the first team; his La Liga debut came against CA Osasuna at the age of 21 in August 1985, having been an important figure for the reserves the previous year (34 league starts, which would prove to be the highest return in his career). Txirri was fully integrated into the Athletic senior squad in 1989‚Äì90. The previous season he had played in the UEFA Cup against Juventus, and he featured in 26 league games following his promotion; however, he was unable to secure a regular place in the team ahead of contemporaries Genar Andrin√∫a and Patxi Salinas and the younger Rafael Alkorta and Patxi Ferreira, all of whom were Spanish internationals, and was allowed to move on, joining CD M√°laga of the second tier in summer 1990. Later years Quintanilla's first season on the Costa del Sol was fairly successful, playing 26 times as M√°laga reached the promotion playoffs despite economic difficulties; Txirri scored his penalty in the shootout against local rivals C√°diz, but the tie ended in defeat. He missed all of 1991‚Äì92 (which ended with M√°laga's relegation and dissolution) due to an injury sustained on the first matchday, and then transferred to Atl√©tico Marbella, newly-promoted to the same level. After one year playing regularly with Marbella, prior to the 1993‚Äì94 season he moved on to a third Andalusian club in the second tier, Real Betis, following his former coach Sergije Kre≈°iƒá who also brought Tom√°s Ol√≠as and Juan Ram√≥n Comas to Seville from Marbella. Txirri was part of the Betis team which eliminated FC Barcelona from the Copa del Rey and achieved promotion, but his involvement was curtailed due to injury, and after that single season he was allowed to leave by Kre≈°iƒá's replacement as manager, Lorenzo Serra Ferrer. Quintanilla's last three campaigns were spent in the regionalised third tier, firstly with Elche for two years. In his final season as a professional, 1996‚Äì97, he returned to his home region of Biscay to play for the amateur club SD Zamudio, making their debut at that level of competition. Txirri posted his best appearance figures for a decade (32 league starts, plus seven goals) but his input could not prevent the club's immediate relegation, and he decided to retire from playing aged 33. Post-playing career After his playing days ended, Quintanilla remained in football, embarking on a career as a support staff member. He was involved in scouting with Athletic Bilbao for several years, including acting as a liaison for local affiliated clubs. In 2015 he was removed from his position, eventually winning a case of unfair dismissal against Athletic in court, meanwhile working with the youth teams of SD Leioa. When the dispute with his former employers was resolved in 2017, he took on a similar role with their neighbours Real Sociedad, as the club from San Sebasti√°n sought to expand their recruitment knowledge in Biscay province. Personal life Quintanilla's son Alex is also a footballer. He too plays as a defender and was trained in the ranks of Athletic Bilbao, although he never made an appearance for the senior side.

The Institute of Contemporary Art, Miami is dedicated to promoting continuous experimentation in contemporary art, advancing new scholarship, and fostering the exchange of art and ideas throughout the Miami region and internationally. Through a calendar of exhibitions and programs, and its collection, ICA Miami provides an international platform for the work of local, emerging, and under-recognized artists, and further advances the public appreciation and understanding of the most innovative art of our time. The museum is deeply committed to providing open, public access to art by offering year-round free admission. History Institute of Contemporary Art first opened in 1996 under the Museum of Contemporary Art in a building designed by Charles Gwathmey. In 2014, due to issues of zoning, the museum's board sued the city for the right to move, leading to the establishment of the Institute of Contemporary Art in 2017 in the current location in Miami's Design District. The Museum of Contemporary Art, North Miami remains at the initial location.  Architecture  ICA Miami: view from the front Funded by Norman Braman and his wife, who remains co-chair on the board of trustees at ICA, the architectural design of the museum's building is an integral part of the museum's reputation. Designed in 2017 by Aranguren & Gallegos architects, the building was constructed to mimic a ‚ÄúMagic Box‚Äù with its bright and geometrically shape and texture. The building consists of 37,500-square-feet of space, including its exterior. Three stories tall, with 20,000 feet of gallery space to house the various exhibitions and permanent collection, as well as a sculpture garden in the back, the structure borders the residential neighbourhood adjacent to the Design District. The back side of the structure is lined with windows to keep sunshine coming through the building, and to give any visitors a chance to see the sculpture garden that lies below the rows of windows. The 15,000 foot sculpture garden is home to works by Mark Handforth, Abigail DeVille, Allora and Calzadilla, and Pedro Reyes. The building was visualised as a sort of magnet, both literally and figuratively. Not only was the concept of attracting the public with a geometrical design important to the concept, but the facade of the building itself can be compared to the dark grey and smooth material of any magnet.  Permanent Collection  As is true for much of the museum's art, Institute of Contemporary Art, Miami's permanent collection seeks to reflect efforts to expose new talent, while also showcasing many well known artists.[10] The collection include works from many different artists including Rita Ackerman, Francis Al√øs, Hernan Bas, Louise Bourgeois, William Copley, Ann Craven, Jose Antonio Hernandez Diez, Inka Essenhigh, Mark Handforth, Jim Hodges, Nancy and Edward Kienholz, Guillermo Kuitca, Zoe Leonard, John Miller, Malcom Morley, Chris Ofili, Gabriel Orozco, Enoc Perez, Raymond Pettibon, Robert Therrien, and James Turrell.  Exhibitions  With its opening in December 2017, Institute of Contemporary Art, Miami provided another exhibition platform for Miami Art Basel, a critically acclaimed cultural attraction to the city. Various artists had work shown at the opening, such as Abigail DeVille‚Äôs work in the sculpture garden, Tomm el-Saieh, Senga Nengudi, Edward and Nancy Kienholz, and H√©lio Oiticica. Furthermore, ICA introduced ‚ÄúThe Everywhere Studio.‚Äù The exhibition, which was curated by Alex Gartenfeld, artistic director of the museum, Gean Moreno, program curator for the museum, and Stephanie Seidel. The Everywhere studio was considered to be the most notable portion of the museum's opening. It showcased more than 100 works from more than fifty artists spanning over the past five decades. The exhibition became known for its mixing of well known and unknown artists and wide variety of time and location explored. Pablo Picasso and Roy Lichtenstein, both well- known artist from the mid 20th century, were showcased amongst far lesser known Miami artists. Since its opening exhibitions, the museum has housed many different exhibitions. In April 2018, Donald Judd was represented in ‚ÄúDonald Judd: Paintings,‚Äù an exhibition that showcased 14 of Judd's paintings from the years 1959 to 1961. Within the same month, exhibitions by Walter Darby Bannard and Francis Al√øs opened to the public. Later, in May 2018, ICA Miami focused on Diamond Stingily in the artist's first solo show, ‚ÄúDiamond Stingily: Life In My Pocket.‚Äù The multi-media exhibition drew large crowds at its opening. Simultaneously, an exhibit of Terry Adkins‚Äô work opened in one of the museum's exhibition spaces. ‚ÄúTerry Adkins: Infinity Is Always Less Than One‚Äù comprised more than 50 works from throughout the artist's life. In July 2018, Sondra Perry‚Äôs exhibition, ‚ÄúSondra Perry: Typhoon Coming On,‚Äù was opened to the public. Perry's exhibition used multiple forms of media to ‚Äúexplore the intersection of black identity, digital culture and power.‚Äù Also opened in July 2018, ICA Miami created a space for works by Louise Bourgeois. With one of the artist's works already in the museum's permanent collection, the exhibition focuses on Bourgeois‚Äô other notable sculptures. In early November 2018, ICA Miami curated Manuel Solano's exhibition, ‚ÄúManuel Solano:I Don‚Äôt Wanna Wait For Our Lives To Be Over.‚Äù ‚ÄúLarry Bell: Time Machine,‚Äù also opened in November, surveys many of Larry Bell‚Äôs various works, from his early works to the glass sculptures and works he is generally known for.  Programs  Apart from the free access provided to acclaimed exhibitions across various artistic platforms, the Institute of Contemporary Art, Miami is also known for the various programs and services it provides. ICA Ideas build upon the current exhibitions available to the public with different classes and speeches, and providing a platform for additional performances. Through this program, for example, Charles Gaines composed a performance for the museum's crowd entitled A Visual Recital. ICA Speaks is one of the museum's programs that invites associated artists to give speeches or organise symposiums regarding the various permanent works displayed in the space. Panels and speeches from artists such as Mark Handforth and Hernan Bas have been arranged for purposes of explanation and audience engagement. ICA Performs consists of various dance, theatre, and other performing art programs that put on showcases in various parts of the museum. The museum has collaborated with performance artists such as Michael Clark and Trisha Brown to provide museum- goers with live performances. Lastly, ICA Residents is an inaugural program that was dedicated to exposure of local musicians. The various events were in partnership with Miami Music Club, and they were centred around the idea of pairing local Miami artists with non-local artists in a singular showcase. The headliners were artists such as Drew McDowall, Via App and Profligate.  Management  Overseeing the construction of the current permanent venue, Ellen Salpeter joined as director of the museum in December 2015. In early 2018, Ellen Salpeter, director of ICA Miami since 2015, stepped down. Taking Salpeter's place, Alex Gartenfeld, the deputy director and chief curator, became artistic director in 2018, with Tommy Ralph Pace taking on the role of deputy director. Gartenfeld is also known for his work at the New Museum, where he co-curated the 2018 New Museum Triennial.

Officials in Khuzestan province quickly denied the news. On 4 December, members of the Haft Tape Union, warned that the health of Esmaeil Bakhshi and Sepideh Ghelyan is in a dire state, as they could not tell what time of day it was.

He offers as examples: * the Jacobites: \\"Such, in Scotland, are the Gaels, the supporters of the Stuarts from 1640 to 1745.\\" * the Chouannerie: \\"Such, in France, are the Bretons, the supporters of the Bourbons from 1792 to 1800.\\" * the First Carlist War: \\"Such, in Spain, are the Basques, the supporters of Don Carlos.\\" Engels was referring also specifically to the Serb uprising of 1848‚Äì49, in which Serbs from Vojvodina fought against the previously victorious Hungarian revolution. Engels finished the article with the following prediction: > But at the first victorious uprising of the French proletariat, which Louis > Napoleon is striving with all his might to conjure up, the Austrian Germans > and Magyars will be set free and wreak a bloody revenge on the Slav > barbarians. The general war which will then break out will smash this Slav > Sonderbund and wipe out all these petty hidebound nations, down to their > very names. > > The next world war will result in the disappearance from the face of the > earth not only of reactionary classes and dynasties, but also of entire > reactionary peoples. And that, too, is a step forward. Critique Engels views were criticised by leading socialist Karl Kautsky who in 1915 argued that subsequent to 1848/9 the Czech and Austrian South Slavs had transformed themselves in a manner which in practice refuted the views of Marx and Engels. Referring to Heinrich Cunow he wrote: > Today when those people have achieved such great power and significance to > refer to them in the old Marxian terms of 1848/9 does appear most > unfortunate. Should someone today still hold onto that standpoint he has a > lot to unlearn Roman Rozdolsky analyses Engels' position in his book Engels and the 'Nonhistoric' Peoples: the National Question in the Revolution of 1848. > There are two ways to look at Marx and Engels: as the creators of a > brilliant, but in its deepest essence, thoroughly critical, scientific > method; or as church fathers of some sort, the bronzed figures of a > monument. Those who have the latter vision will not have found this study to > their taste. We, however, prefer to see them as they were in reality. Rosdolsky examines Engels' viewpoint at length. Both Marx and Engels had supported the 1848 revolution which had spread throughout Europe. They saw this as a necessary first step towards the Socialist revolution, which was hoped to be imminent. However, the forces of reaction rallied in Klemens von Metternich's Austria in October 1848 with the brutal suppression of the Vienna Uprising. Engels was prompted to write his article thanks to the Austrian Slavs' rejection of the opportunity to liberate themselves from the oppressive rule of the Habsburgs, as well their enthusiastic embrace of Metternich‚Äôs counter-revolution. Controversy This last passage, the final paragraph of Engels' article in 1849, has fuelled accusations that this constitutes a call for genocide. The British Liberal historian, George Watson, for example, cited this text by Engels as evidence for his view that Hitler was a Marxist. He also participated in the conservative documentary The Soviet Story, where he uses the translation of V√∂lkerabf√§lle as \\"racial trash\\".minute 16:37 Film \\"The Soviet Story\\" The film attracted criticism from a range of people including Latvian MEP Tatjana ≈Ωdanoka, Finnish political activist Johan B√§ckman and Latvian MP Boris Tsilevitch. Alexander Dyukov has provided evidence that the film relies on falsified images to give an historically inaccurate account of the Soviet Union.

The Convention was held after the 16-member Referendum Council, appointed in 2015, had travelled around the country and met with over 1,200 people. The statement was issued after the Convention, and calls for a \\"First Nations Voice\\" in the Australian Constitution and a Makarrata Commission to supervise a process of \\"agreement- making\\" and truth-telling between the Australian Government and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. (Makarrata is a Yolngu word approximating the meaning of \\"treaty\\".) The statement references the 1967 referendum which brought about changes to the Constitution of Australia to include Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians in the national census. Background The 16-member Referendum Council was jointly appointed by the Prime Minister, Malcolm Turnbull, and Leader of the Opposition, Bill Shorten, on 7 December 2015. The Council was to advise the government on steps towards a referendum to recognise Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples in the Australian Constitution. It built on extensive work by the Expert Panel on Constitutional Recognition of Indigenous Australians and the Joint Select Committee on Constitutional Recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples. 50px Text was copied from this source, which is available under a Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0) licence. (See here.) The Council was made up of Indigenous and non-Indigenous community leaders and co-chaired by Patrick Dodson, and Mark Leibler AC. Dodson resigned from the Council on 2 March 2016 after being endorsed by the Australian Labor Party for a vacant Western Australian Senate seat, and was replaced by serving Council member Pat Anderson . Over a six-month period the Council travelled to 12 different locations around Australia and met with over 1,200 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander representatives. The meetings resulted in a consensus document on constitutional recognition, the Uluru Statement from the Heart. The First Nations National Constitutional Convention met over four days from 23 to 26 May 2017. Council member Megan Davis gave the first public reading of the statement at the conclusion of the 2017 First Nations National Constitutional Convention at Uluru. The convention was adopted by the 250 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander delegates. Uluru Statement from the Heart  Text The text of the Statement is as follows: :\\"We, gathered at the 2017 National Constitutional Convention, coming from all points of the southern sky, make this statement from the heart: :Our Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander tribes were the first sovereign Nations of the Australian continent and its adjacent islands, and possessed it under our own laws and customs. This our ancestors did, according to the reckoning of our culture, from the Creation, according to the common law from ‚Äòtime immemorial‚Äô, and according to science more than 60,000 years ago. :This sovereignty is a spiritual notion: the ancestral tie between the land, or ‚Äòmother nature‚Äô, and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples who were born therefrom, remain attached thereto, and must one day return thither to be united with our ancestors. This link is the basis of the ownership of the soil, or better, of sovereignty. It has never been ceded or extinguished, and co-exists with the sovereignty of the Crown. :How could it be otherwise? That peoples possessed a land for sixty millennia and this sacred link disappears from world history in merely the last two hundred years? :With substantive constitutional change and structural reform, we believe this ancient sovereignty can shine through as a fuller expression of Australia‚Äôs nationhood. :Proportionally, we are the most incarcerated people on the planet. We are not an innately criminal people. Our children are aliened from their families at unprecedented rates. This cannot be because we have no love for them. And our youth languish in detention in obscene numbers. They should be our hope for the future. :These dimensions of our crisis tell plainly the structural nature of our problem. This is the torment of our powerlessness. :We seek constitutional reforms to empower our people and take a rightful place in our own country. When we have power over our destiny our children will flourish. They will walk in two worlds and their culture will be a gift to their country. :We call for the establishment of a First Nations Voice enshrined in the Constitution. :Makarrata is the culmination of our agenda: the coming together after a struggle. It captures our aspirations for a fair and truthful relationship with the people of Australia and a better future for our children based on justice and self- determination. :We seek a Makarrata Commission to supervise a process of agreement-making between governments and First Nations and truth-telling about our history. :In 1967 we were counted, in 2017 we seek to be heard. We leave base camp and start our trek across this vast country. We invite you to walk with us in a movement of the Australian people for a better future.\\" ;Note on Makarrata : Makarrata is a Yolngu word \\"describing a process of conflict resolution, peacemaking and justice\\", or \\"a coming together after a struggle\\", and delegates said that it \\"captures our aspirations for a fair and truthful relationship with the people of Australia\\", and the Makarrata Commission would \\"supervise a process of agreement-making between governments and First Nations\\". Artwork In keeping with the tradition of the Yirrkala bark petitions and the Barunga statement, the Uluru Statement was made in the form of a work of art. The statement is placed in the centre which is where the power resides. Surrounding the statement are signatures of over 250 delegates who attended the conference and reached consensus. 100 first nations are represented in the statement by signatories who included the name of their nation. The artwork tells the story of two Tjukurpa creation stories of the traditional owners of Uluru, the A·πâangu people. One tells how the Uluru landscape was shaped by a fight to the death at the Mutitjulu Rockhole between Kuniya, the woma python with eggs from the north east, at the top left, and Liru, the poisonous snake from the south west, at the bottom left. The other tells the story of the Mala people, represented by the Rufous hare-wallaby who, while holding a ceremony at the top of Uluru, became involved in a dispute with men who came from the west. The men left and created Kurpany, the devil dingo, represented by the dog prints. Presentation of Final Report and Uluru Statement to government The Final Report of the Referendum Council was published on 30 June 2017, and sent to the Prime Minister, Malcolm Turnbull, and the leader of the opposition, Bill Shorten. It included the Uluru Statement as a preface, and the essay Rom Watangu ‚Äì The Law Of The Land by Galarrwuy Yunupingu, in which he describes Rom watangu as the overarching law of the land, which is \\"lasting and alive... my backbone\\". Its first recommendation, relating specifically to the Constitution is this: > That a referendum be held to provide in the Australian Constitution for a > representative body that gives Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander First > Nations a Voice to the Commonwealth Parliament. One of the specific > functions of such a body, to be set out in legislation outside the > Constitution, should include the function of monitoring the use of the heads > of power in section 51 (xxvi) and section 122. The body will recognise the > status of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as the first peoples > of Australia. The second recommendation is \\"That an extra-constitutional Declaration of Recognition be enacted by legislation passed by all Australian Parliaments, ideally on the same day, to articulate a symbolic statement of recognition to unify Australians\\". It also says that there are other matters of great importance to Australia‚Äôs Indigenous peoples that can be more appropriately addressed outside the Constitution, realising the difficulties involved in Constitutional amendments, and recognising the principle of parliamentary supremacy. being: a statement of recognition; the establishment of a Makarrata Commission; a process to facilitate truth telling. The official painted and signed canvas artork of the Statement was presented to the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition on 5 August 2017, at the Garma Festival in north- east Arnhem Land in the Northern Territory. The Statement was also on display alongside musician John Butler at the Woodford Folk Festival in Queensland. Government response On 26 October 2017 Prime Minister Turnbull issued a joint statement with the Attorney-General, George Brandis, and the Indigenous Affairs Minister, Nigel Scullion, rejecting the statement. The statement said \\"The government does not believe such a radical change to our Constitution‚Äôs representative institutions has any realistic prospect of being supported by a majority of Australians in a majority of states‚Äù. Constitutional change advocate and Uluru delegate, Jesse John Fleay, said \\"This criticism came, apparently ignorant of the fact that most Commonwealth nations‚Äîincluding New Zealand and Canada‚Äîhave enacted far less conservative treaties with their First People, and none of these democracies have collapsed. The criticism also came with apparent unawareness of the fact that Australia remains the only Commonwealth nation without a treaty with its First People\\". Community response Objections While not objecting to the content of the statement, Anangu elders Alison Hunt and Donald Fraser asked that the Reconciliation Council remove the word Uluru from the title, saying it was included without proper consultation. A representative of the Working Group said she was aware of the request and that the group is prepared to respect it, but that it is \\"not unusual\\" for statements to be named after the meeting place from where it was made. Lidia Thorpe and several other delegates walked out of the convention and refused to sign the final document, due to the absence of the suggestion of a treaty. Thorpe believes that the \\"Uluru process was hijacked by Aboriginal corporations and establishment appointments and did not reflect the aspirations of ordinary Indigenous people\\". Support In his 2019 induction speech to the Logies Hall of Fame, Journalist Kerry O'Brien voiced his support for the Uluru statement from the heart by calling on the Australian Parliament, during the current term, to \\"make a genuine effort to understand and support what is embodied in the Uluru Statement From the Heart\\". He added \\"the Uluru statement represents no threat to a single individual in any corner of this country, and certainly no threat to the integrity of Parliament. And if you're told that, don't you believe it. On the contrary, it will add much to the integrity of our nation\\". In May 2019, 22 leaders in the Australian finance sector called for all Australians to embrace the Uluru Statement from the heart. Investment banker and philanthropist, John Wylie wrote in the Weekend Australian \\"We believe that accepting the call in the Uluru Statement for constitutional recognition will be a foundation stone of a modern Australia that‚Äôs a spiritually generous country truly at peace with itself and its history.\\" Follow-up The Joint Select Committee on Constitutional Recognition relating to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples was appointed in March 2018, co-chaired by Senator Patrick Dodson and Julian Leeser MP and comprising six Lower House and four Upper House representatives. It presented its final report on 29 November 2018. There were four recommendations in the report: PDF > #In order to achieve a design for The Voice that best suits the needs and > aspirations of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, the Committee > recommends that the Australian Government initiate a process of co-design > with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. #The Committee > recommends that, following a process of co-design, the Australian Government > consider, in a deliberate and timely manner, legislative, executive and > constitutional options to establish The Voice. #The Committee recommends > that the Australian Government support the process of truth-telling. #The > Committee also recommends that the Australian Government consider the > establishment, in Canberra, of a National Resting Place, for Aboriginal and > Torres Strait Islander remains which could be a place of commemoration, > healing and reflection. The first recommendation, that of creating an Indigenous voice to government via \\"co-design process\\", was set in train by the establishment of the Senior Advisory Group (SAG), announced by Minister for Indigenous Australians Ken Wyatt in October 2019. The Senior Advisory Group is co-chaired by Professor Tom Calma , Chancellor of the University of Canberra, and Professor Dr Marcia Langton, Associate Provost at the University of Melbourne, and comprises a total of 20 leaders and experts from across the country. The government also said it would run a referendum during its present term about recognising Indigenous people in the constitution \\"should a consensus be reached and should it be likely to succeed‚Äù. By March 2020 (around the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia), the two other groups, National and Local and Regional, had been set up and had met at least once.  From the Heart  From the Heart is a campaign designed to increase awareness and understanding of the Uluru Statement from the Heart and a constitutionally-enshrined Voice to Parliament, and to show that it is a fair and practical reform. Public opinion Research commissioned by From the Heart and conducted by the T Group in June 2020 shows that a majority of Australians support a constitutionally-enshrined Voice to Parliament, and that this support has increased 7 percent in three months, from 49 percent in March to 56 percent in June 2020. There were 2000 participants in the survey, who were asked, \\"If a referendum were held today, how would you vote on the proposal to change the Constitution to set up a new body comprising Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people that gives advice to federal parliament on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander issues?‚Äù. Only 17 percent said they would vote no, down 3 percent since March 2020.

It had its own constitution which was created before the Constitution of 3 May 1791. The state was recognized by the Grand Duke and King Stanis≈Çaw August Poniatowski himself. The Great Sejm (1788‚Äì1792) also recognized the republic and approved its statute. It covered an area of and had about 800 residents. Brzostowski implemented various progressive policies ‚Äì abolished serfdom granting personal freedoms to the peasants, replaced corv√©e with a land tax paid in cash, established a school and a pharmacy, encouraged more profitable agricultural activities (such as fruit tree gardens or animal husbandry). Brzostowski's revenue from the manor more than doubled. The republic ceased to exist in 1795 when, due to the Third Partition of the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth, Brzostowski exchanged the manor with Fryderyk J√≥zef Moszy≈Ñski for properties in Saxony and Dresden. Moszy≈Ñski sold the manor to Count de Choiseul-Gouffier in 1799. The new owners tolerated some of the freedoms until Brzostowski's death in 1827.

Completed in 1878, the composer premiered it at the Palais du Trocad√©ro as part of the Paris World Exhibition. It was first published by Hamelle in 1879, together with the famous Symphony for Organ No. 5.  History  Widor composed the work, one of ten organ symphonies, when he was organist at Saint-Sulpice, a post he held from 1870. The church features a main organ by Aristide Cavaill√©-Coll which inspired the composer who wrote \\"If I had not experienced the seduction of these timbres or the mystical attraction of this wave of sound, I would never have written organ music.\\" Widor's first four symphonies were published by J. Maho in 1872 as his Op. 13. The two following symphonies were published as his Op. 42 in 1879 by Julien Hamelle, Maho's successor. They were reprinted in 1887, now with the revised first four, and the new No. VII and VIII, with a foreword by the composer regarding \\"the style, the procedures of registration and the signs\\". Widor often revised his works several times even after publication. The Salle de spectacle in the Palais du Trocad√©ro, model Widor probably composed the Symphonie VI between his return from a visit to Bayreuth in 1876, where he attended the first Bayreuth Festival, presenting the first performance of Wagner's Der Ring des Nibelungen, and the summer of 1878. He premiered it for the inauguration of a Cavaill√©-Coll organ at the Palais du Trocad√©ro in Paris on 24 August 1878 as part of the Paris World Exhibition. A critical edition of Symponie VI was published by Carus-Verlag in 2015, based predominantly on the last edition during Widor's lifetime, 1929.  Structure and music  The work is structured in five movements: # Allegro # Adagio # Intermezzo # Cantabile # Final Widor's organ symphonies are not as much a structural unit, but extended suites with orchestral sound. He wrote: \\"The modern organ is thus symphonic in essence. The new instrument demands a new language, an ideal differing from scholastic polyphony.\\" The first movement introduces a chorale-like theme, and expands in both sonata form and variations. A recitative-episode becomes a second theme. The second movement, in three sections, present \\"sensual chromaticism\\", with a registration of \\"Gambes et Voix c√©lestes\\". According to Albert Schweitzer, it was inspired by Wagner's music heard in Bayreuth. The third movement serves as a scherzo. Three voices receive a specific sound by the registration \\"Anches et cornets de 4 et de 8\\", like the grand jeu of the classical French organ school. The fourth movement has a lengthy theme, of which several motifs are derived. The fifth movement is a sonata-rondo, culminating in a \\"tumultuous coda\\".

VAHPA forms Branch No. 3 of Health Services Union Victoria (HSU Vic). VAHPA has around 5,000 members covering health professionals working in allied health professions in the public, community and private healthcare sectors. These professions include Medical Imaging Technologists, Occupational Therapists, Physiotherapists, Radiation Therapists and others.  History  VAHPA was originally a state registered trade union in Victoria. The union had a period of slow and steady growth during the early 1980s.. Like many of its state-based contemporaries, VAHPA merged with the larger federally registered Hospital Employees‚Äô Federation of Australia in 1986. HEF would later become the Health Services Union of Australia (HSUA) and finally the Health Services Union(HSU). In May 2010, the branch amalgamated with HSU New South Wales and Branch number 1 of the HSU Victorian Division to form HSU East. Following the HSU expenses scandal involving then senior HSU officials Craig Thomson, Micael Williamson and Kathy Jackson; in June 2012, HSU East was put into administration. Shortly thereafter the entity was dismantled, the component associations reestablished and fresh elections ordered. Following the elections, the new leadership adopted the designation Victorian Health Professionals Association (VHPA) as an interim measure in keeping with the branch's long-standing association with the Health Professionals award. Finally, in August 2015, the branch changed its name to its current name.  Governance and structure  VAHPA is governed by a Branch Committee of Management (BCOM) which is elected by the union membership . The last round of elections took place in June 2018.  Affiliations and politics  VAHPA is affiliated to the Australian Council of Trade Unions. It is also affiliated to the Health Services Union National Council, where it sends delegates. The branch currently holds 5 votes on National Council. VAHPA is also affiliated to a number of regional Trades and Labour Councils in Victoria; including to the Victorian Trades and Labour Council and Geelong Trades and Labour Council. Politically, VAHPA is considered to be on the Left of the political spectrum and has regularly made statements in support of refugee rights, LGBTI rights, action on climate change and other social issues. It is not affiliated to the Australian Labor Party. VAHPA has made a number of political donations. It has donated to the Greens and has also made donations towards the council election campaigns of Yarra City Councillor Steven Jolly and to Sue Bolton of Socialist Alliance as part of her successful run for Moreland City Council. VAHPA was also among the first unions to support the Victorian Socialists, donating $3500 worth of election materials as part of a failed push to get its candidates elected to the Victorian Legislative Council at the 2018 Victorian state election. VAHPA has been active in campaigning around community health, both for better wages and conditions for community health workers as well as better government funding for community health more generally.

In the middle of the 1890s the jeweller's wife, the bourgeois B.G. Lyakhovskaya became the owner of the site. Probably in 1895 the Lyakhovskys built two brick one-storey houses on the plot, separated by gates. These houses were absolutely identical in the mirror image they have 3 windows and a front door. According to \\"The inventory and assessment of real estate of Taganrog\\" in 1915 the site to the address Depaldovsky Lane 24 belonged to the businessman Solomon Aronovich Berlin and was estimated at 8,000 rubles.

It is located in Valsain in the Province of Segovia, in the Castile and Le√≥n Autonomous region of central Spain. It is approximately from Segovia, and north of Madrid. The Trastamara kings of Castile already had a hunting lodge in Valsain. But the royal palace itself was built between 1552 and 1556 for King Philip II by the architect Gaspar de Vega after the king returned from a trip to France, England, and the Netherlands. The architecture of the palace was heavily influenced by Netherlandish/ Flemish architecture, such as Binche Palace, features of which were until then unknown in Spain: steeply pitched slate roofs, slated spires, dormer windows. These became characteristics of the Habsburg architecture in Spain. The palace was the birthplace of princess Isabella Clara Eugenia, daughter of Philip II of Spain and his third wife Elisabeth of Valois, who later together with her husband Albert VII, Archduke of Austria became sovereign of the Spanish Netherlands in the Low Countries and the north of modern France. The English Prince Charles came to Valsain in 1623, during the visit known as the \\"Spanish match\\". He admired the orchards and the situation of the building.John Nichols, Progresses of James the First, vol. 4 (London, 1828), pp. 914-5.Henry Ettinghausen, 'Greatest News Story', in Alexander Samson, The Spanish Match: Prince Charles's Journey to Madrid, 1623 (Ashgate, 2006), p. 86. On 22 October 1682, the palace burnt down to a shell. Due to the political situation in Spain and the crisis around the succession, King Charles II was not abled to restore the palace. His successor King Philip V built close by a new palace: \\"La Granja\\" (Royal Palace of La Granja de San Ildefonso). Today only the ruins remain.

The Turkish joint venture consortium of Cengiz-Kolin- Limak-Mapa-Kalyon offered to build the airport as part of the assistance the Albanian government has been receiving from the Turkish government and Turkish Airlines. However, the Turkish consortium decided to withdraw from the initiative a year later. In September 2019, a new project was unveiled by the Albanian Government consisting in the construction of a marina and retail complex including an agri-tourism site. The project is expected to start in the summer of 2020, and finish by 2023. The tender for the construction of the airport was temporarily suspended by the Albanian government on 31 March 2020 without any reason given.

She fled Iraq in 1996 after her husband was killed and was granted asylum in the United States. She returned to Iraq in 2003 and was elected to the National Assembly of Iraq and was an advisor in the drafting of the constitution. Early life and education Zakia Hakki was born on 18 November 1939 in Baghdad to an established Fayali Kurd family. She graduated from law school in 1957, one of five women in a class of 350. She has a Bachelor of Science in business administration from the International Labor Union in Switzerland and a Doctor of Law degree from the University of Baghdad. Career Hakki worked in Baghdad as both a lawyer and judge. In the 1950s, she smuggled documents into the US embassy about the treatment of Kurds in Iraq. She founded the Kurdish Women's Federation and served as its president from 1958 to 1975. Haqqi advocated for the rights of Kurdish people and women. She was a founding member of the Kurdish Women's Association and became its president in 1958, a post she held till 1975. In 1959, Hakki was appointed as a judge by Abd al-Karim Qasim, becoming the first woman appointed as a judge in Iraq, and making her the first female judge in the Middle East. In 1970, she became the only woman in the leadership of the Kurdistan Democratic Party. In 1959, Abd al-Karim Qasim appointed Haqqi to the bench. She became the first woman in the Arab world to be appointed a judge. During 1970‚Äì75, she was the head of Kurdistan Democratic Party. Constant persecution from Saddam Hussein's regime, forced her to move to the United States in 1996, where she worked as a lawyer. In 1975, she received her Juris Doctor degree from University of Baghdad's law school. She was a senior official in the ministries of industry and agriculture in the pre-Saddam Hussein period. As Hussein gained power, she joined the Kurdish cause, fighting as a guerrilla until she was arrested and tortured in 1975. The regime placed her under house arrest and she fled with other KDP leaders to Iran, supported by the Shah. She returned to Baghdad but kept a lower political profile, working in family and civil law. She survived numerous assassination attempts and her husband and brother were killed by Hussein's people for speaking out against the regime's policies. Hakki fled Iraq in 1996, bribing her way out of the country with a valuable carpet. She received political asylum in the United States. She was a member of the Independents Liberal Politician Iraqi Women Group, speaking out about conditions for women in Hussein's Iraq. Hakki worked as an attorney in Northern Virginia and was the vice president of the Iraqi-American Council. She supported her son in his fight for asylum in the US after he was accused of being a double agent. Hakki returned to Iraq in 2003, seeking to put her legal expertise to work in rebuilding the country. She was elected a member of the interim parliament. She was hired by the Coalition Provisional Authority's interim Ministry of Justice to make recommendations about legal reforms to the Constitution Review Committee. However, neither she nor any other woman was able to participate in the drafting process for the new constitution, debate the constitution publicly or review it before the final draft became public. In 2004, Hakki was an outspoken opponent against the US-backed Iraqi Governing Council's decision to cancel family laws and place jurisdiction under sharia, saying, \\"This new law will send Iraqi families back to the Middle Ages.\\" When Shiite Islamic parties pushed for sharia to be enshrined in the interim constitution, Hakki used her Department of Defense clearance to bring activists into the Green Zone and staged sit-ins in US proconsul Paul Bremer's office until he agreed to veto sharia. She was an adviser to Iraq's Ministry of Justice in 2004 and 2005. In 2005 she said, \\"I am thankful America liberated us from Saddam Hussein, but I resent how it has been dealing with Iraqis since then.\\" She won the January 2005 Iraqi parliamentary election and served on the drafting committee. The same December she was elected to the Iraqi Council of Representatives and was a member of the Constitutional Review Committee. Personal life Hakki is a Shia Muslim. During the Ba'athist rule in Iraq, Haqqi was placed under house arrest. The then President Saddam Hussein had her husband, brother and cousins killed. Two of her sons were evacuated to Guam and held in INS detention: Ali, a doctor with his wife and two children, and his brother who had deserted Hussein's army after witnessing the destruction of a Kurdish village.

Together with Pierre de Coubertin and Paschal Grousset, he was the founder of French physical education, developing the schooling system to include sports and games. He was awarded the Legion of Honor in 1932.Philippe Auguste Tissi√© in the Leonore database of the French Government.  Early life and medicine  Philippe Auguste Tissi√© was born to a Protestant family in La Bastide-sur-l'Hers in the Ari√®ge department in southwestern France. Orphaned, he had to work from an early age. After several menial jobs, he became deputy librarian at a faculty of medicine. As a late student of medicine, he presented his thesis called Les ali√©n√©s voyageurs : essai m√©dico-psychologique (Traveling Madmen: A Medico-Psychological Paper) on February 16, 1887, examining the case of Jean-Albert Dadas and popularizing dromomania. The thesis was made under the mentorship of Albert Pitres, himself a disciple of Jean-Martin Charcot. His experience from the medicinal association of Pau, his own \\"psycho-dynamic\\" clinic, a kindergarten, and a Protestant orphanage in Saverdun, led him to classify human beings into three groups: the passives, the affectives, and the affirmatives. He believed Swedish gymnastics could be applied for various treatments. He believed all his life that the brain and lungs had priority over any other aspect of physical education. Physical education As a cyclist and the physician of the V√©loce-club Bordelais and a member of the La Bastidienne gymnastics association founded by Charles Cazalet, he had views that were independent from either Paschal Grousset or Pierre de Coubertin:The League estimates that school sports are a general competition of muscles, and that emulation cannot exist without competition (from his correspondence with Pierre de Coubertin in Jean Durry, Tissi√© et Coubertin, page 82) his opinions went against the sensibilities of the LeftPierre de Coubertin, Le sport contre l'√©ducation physique dans la IIIe R√©publique. and, as a hygienist, he opposed the idea of competition, its violence, and the notion of sport promoted by the \\"Comit√© de propagande des exercices physiques\\". But he also became disillusioned with the traditional gymnastics he knew at La Bastidienne: Man was created to live on earth and not in the trees. On 19 December 1888, he created \\"La Ligue girondine d'√©ducation physique\\" (Girondin League of Physical Education) to promote traditional open- air games. His first school sports event (lendit) took place on 12 May 1890. He also founded La revue des jeux scolaires (School Games Magazine). When he went on a mission in Sweden in 1898, he discovered Swedish gymnastics and became their unconditional supporter. The preacher of traditional open-air games became a disciple of Pehr Henrik Ling without renouncing his past: from that point on, his physical education combined Swedish gymnastics with applied gymnastics from sport games. Living in Pau from 1903, he worked on the propagation of his system, but his criticism of other French gymnastic practices resulted in his removal from inspection duties and a ban of his lendits by the ministry in 1907. Grousset died in 1909. A year later, Tissi√© became the leader of the French League of Physical Education. In 1927, he founded the \\"Institut r√©gional d'√©ducation physique\\" (Regional Institute of Physical Education) of Bordeaux within the local faculty of medicine, followed by eleven more institutes in the following year. Tissi√© conceived the \\"youth days\\", which were implemented by the French secretariat for physical education in 1932. He was present at the first new lendit in 1934. He died the following year.

The object number of cultural heritage of regional significance is 661720974950005.  Architecture  The buildings have important city-forming significance, they are examples of residential buildings erected in forms of constructivism with decor in the forms of Soviet neoclassicism. The complex of the central housing section is a sample of the socialist city of the 1930s. In 1934, the Leningrad design organization \\"Editing Project Aluminum\\" developed the \\"General Plan for the Ural Aluminum Plant with an adjacent working population of 20,000 inhabitants.\\" According to this project, the construction of the block began with the first high-rise buildings. The complex laid the foundation for the creation of the central part of the residential area of the socialist city of UAZ. The project is based on the plan \\"Town of Chekists\\" in Yekaterinburg (then Sverdlovsk), executed in 1929. In the central part of the complex there were to be social and cultural facilities, and in the north-western part - the hostel \\"Corps of Bachelors\\". The project laid the foundation of the courtyard: fountains, small architectural forms. The complex consists of four houses, each of which is divided into three five-story volume, connected with each other by the ends with displacement. The facades of the buildings are separated by vertical projections into which are laid staircases and balconies. The balconies are combined vertically and horizontally in the composition. The front facades of the houses along the streets of Kamenskaya and Aluminievaya are decorated with friezes with geometric patterns. The upper parts of the southern and eastern facades of the houses along the streets of Builders and Isetskaya are decorated with geometric ornament.

Geography Listiernan is bounded on the north by Carn, Tullyhunco and Kilnacross townlands, on the west by Kildallan townland, on the south by Bocade Glebe and Feugh (Bishops) townlands and on the east by Drumquill, Killyfern and Kilnaglare townlands. Its chief geographical features are Listiernan Hill which reaches to 362 feet, small streams, dug wells, spring wells and forestry plantations. Listiernan is traversed by minor public roads and rural lanes. The townland covers 391 acres. History From medieval times up to the early 1600s, the land belonged to the McKiernan Clan and is probably the first place they settled in County Cavan after migrating from County Leitrim. The 1609 Plantation of Ulster Map depicts the townland as Listerna. A grant of 1610 spells the name as Listernan. A lease of 1611 spells the name as Listernan. An inquisition of 1629 spells the name as Lysternan. The 1652 Commonwealth Survey spells it as Listiernan. In the Plantation of Ulster King James VI and I by grant dated 27 June 1610, granted the Manor of Keylagh, which included two polls in Listernan, to John Achmootie, a Scottish Groom of the Bedchamber. His brother Alexander Achmootie was granted the neighbouring Manor of Dromheada. On 16 August 1610 John Aghmootie sold his lands in Tullyhunco to James Craig. On 1 May 1611 James Craig leased, inter alia, 2 polls of Listernan to John mac Edmond Oge McKernan. On 29 July 1611 Arthur Chichester, 1st Baron Chichester and others reported that John Auchmothy and Alexander Auchmothye have not appeared at the lands awarded to them. James Craige is their deputy for five years, who has brought 4 artificers of divers sorts with their wives and families and 2 other servants. Stone raised for building a mill and trees felled, a walled house with a smith's forge built, 4 horses and mares upon the grounds with competent arms. An Inquisition held at Ballyconnell on 2 November 1629 stated that the two polls of Lysternan contained eleven sub-divisions named Drommean, Dromshorte, Knocknehearne, Tuonorbie, Kynnagh, Drommane, Tawnelyn, Corraghe, Knockneden, Knockeban and Tawnegallen.Sir James Craig died in the siege of Croaghan Castle on 8 April 1642. His land was inherited by his brother John Craig of Craig Castle, County Cavan and of Craigston, County Leitrim, who was chief doctor to both King James I and Charles I. The 1652 Commonwealth Survey states the owner was Lewis Craig. Ambrose Bedell, the son of William Bedell, Bishop of Kilmore, then purchased Listiernan from the Craig estate. In his will dated 20 June 1682 and proved in Dublin on 20 October 1683, Captain Ambrose Bedell directed that he should be buried in the churchyard of Kilmore beside his father. He devised his lands in Carne and Listiernan, Dromheriffe and Uragh, Killerolyn with the two mills, Antner, Ardue, Clony, Clonachatige, and Greaghrahen, first to his nephew James Bedell and his heirs male; and failing such to his nephew Ambrose Bedell (James Bedell's next brother) and his heirs male; and, failing such, to his (the testator's) heirs next in blood to his father William, late Lord Bishop of Kilmore. In the Hearth Money Rolls compiled on 29 September 1663The Hearth Money Rolls for the Baronies of Tullyhunco and Tullyhaw, County Cavan, edited by Rev. Francis J. McKiernan, in Breifne Journal. Vol. I, No. 3 (1960), pp. 247-263 there was one Hearth Tax payer in Listernan- Neale McNeale. The 1790 Cavan Carvaghs list spells the townland name as Listernan. The 1825 Tithe Applotment Books list seventy tithepayers in the townland. In the 1825 Registry of Freeholders for County Cavan there was one freeholder registered in Listernan: James Brady. He was a Forty-shilling freeholders holding a lease for lives from his landlord, Mr Stanford. The Listiernan Valuation Office Field books are available for April 1838. Griffith's Valuation of 1857 lists thirty-eight landholders in the townland. In the 19th century Listiernan was owned by Captain Bedel Stanford. The Stanford Estate papers are in the National Archives of Ireland. Census {  - ! Year ! Population ! Males ! Females ! Total Houses !

It is described in the ‚ÄòArchaeological Survey of County Cavan‚Äô as- Raised circular area (int. dims. 45.2m NNW-SSE; c. 44m ENE-WSW) enclosed by three earthen banks with outer fosses. From SE-S-SSW the outer fosse and bank and the intermediate fosse have been levelled but their outline is still identifiable. An earlier report (OPW 1969) suggested that the original entrance was probably at SE. Densely overgrown with vegetation. This is the fort that the townland is named after and is the original home of the McKiernan Clan.

The main purpose of this campaign is a constitutional effort to replace the current president through 2019 election. The hashtag went viral when it was used by PKS politician Mardani Ali Sera on Twitter. In English, the term \\"Ganti Presiden\\" literally means \\"Change President.\\"  Background  In April 2018, Mardani Ali Sera, a politician from opposition party PKS, began to spread the hashtag in his social media accounts, with many social media accounts following quickly. Within a short period of time, T-shirts were already produced with the hashtag, with Mardani denying that the movement is a political campaign due to a lack of a supported replacement. The movement garnered significant support from other opposition politicians, including Amien Rais (PAN) and Yusril Ihza Mahendra (PBB). Reasons cited include pressure on Islamic organizations, influx of immigrant workers (mainly from China) due to relaxation of immigration rules and economic issues such as a lack of available jobs and increased prices of necessities. Effect In addition to the social media platform, the hashtag has appeared in T-shirts, hats, mugs, and banners shown in public places. Some users posted the pictures with the hashtag while visiting several cities overseas. In a speech, Joko Widodo mocked that the hashtag and T-shirt cannot change a president. PDI-P secretary-general Hasto Kristiyanto accused the movement of being a political move by the opposition and not an organic movement. In the 2018 West Java gubernatorial election, the hashtag was prominently used by the Sudrajat/Ahmad Syaikhu in their campaign to gain potential voters and significantly increased his electoral vote from 5-9 percent in survey polls to 27-30 percent in real count results, although the pair ultimately lost. Rally Some declarations and rallies supporting the campaign were made in several cities, such as Jakarta, Yogyakarta, and Surakarta. Supporters also tried to organize rallies in Serang, but was denied permission from the municipal government. In addition, the West Java branch of the Indonesian Ulema Council decried the movement, calling them \\"provocateurs\\".  Aftermath  In May 2019, after the 2019 election had passed, Mardani stated that the #2019GantiPresiden movement had \\"closed its books\\".

Harsh goes to visit and consult a psychiatrist who suggests that he is suffering from hallucinations and that he should take a break from work. Meanwhile on a date, Rahul inquires Tanu about her father‚Äôs distant behavior. At his office, Harsh hallucinates a spectral figure staring at him. After consulting his psychiatrist, he decides to go on a vacation with his family. Some moments later, he gets the news that his manager had recently died on-site from an accident. He gives his subordinate Tyagi all the responsibilities, and has a small talk with a man named Satish. While the Tandon family at home prepare for their vacation, Tanu convinces Rahul to come with them. They stop at a petrol station along the way. Tanu goes to buy snacks at the station‚Äôs convenience store, and upon returning, she bumps into a mysterious man dressed all in black. The silence in the car is boring Sam; in an attempt to liven up his family and Rahul, Sam tells a joke but nobody laughed. After fueling the car, the road gets blocked as due to an accident that occurred there. Harsh decides to takes another route, which its longer than the original route but without signs or lights. The Tandons spot a man on the road, who is the same man Tanu bumped into at the petrol station. He asks the family their destination, but they don‚Äôt respond, while Sam jokes about having a corpse in the car. Later, the family see a stroller carrying a doll on the road. Sam tries to scare everyone by acting childishly, in the hopes of fooling them that the doll is possessed and has attacked him. His prank proved to be futile as Sam didn‚Äôt accomplish scaring anybody, but only to get slapped by his angry father. Everyone returns to the car, and so does Sam. Harsh asks him to remove the stroller from the road. After removing the stroller, Sam is shocked to see it reappear on the road. He throws it away this time, only for the stroller to push itself back onto the road. A while later, Harsh hallucinates a ghost, and the car begins to break down. Sam is alone in the car when the radio starts playing static noise saying that \\"everyone will die,\\" despite that there is no signal in that area. A car stops near them, which is the very same man the came across a while back. The man introducing himself as Dev Shukla tells the family that there is no garage nearby, but he offers them to stay at his cottage for the night. After some consideration, the family agrees to go. Upon their arrival to the cottage, the family spots a swing that's swaying by itself, Dev suggests that it might be the wind. After unpacking the car, the family enter the cottage. Dev asks for their destination which Harsh says is Nainital. Dev adds that there is no help here. Tanu tells her mother that she is uncomfortable there. Meanwhile, Sam is alone and sees a doll's foot. He gets closer, and realizes the doll is almost identical the one he saw on the road. He then hears a child‚Äôs giggle going behind him and looks back to see that the doll is now crying blood. Tanu comes, and the doll disappears. Outside Sam sees a young girl holding the doll, but again when Tanu turns to see, the girl and the doll vanish. Tanu tells Rahul about how she is bored of Sam's pranks and childish antics. In his frustration and boredom, Sam takes a knife and starts piercing it through the wall. As a result of his son‚Äôs obnoxious and destructive behavior, Harsh angrily says that he is disowning Sam. Sam's voice begins to change, ominously saying, \\"Everyone will die\\". Now, Sam is outside, and he suddenly feels a sensation on the swing. Dev goes to talk to Sam, in which Sam goes on the road after him. Rahul goes outside to talk to him, and Sam says he is doing nothing. Sam tells everything he saw to Rahul and begs to return. However, Rahul does not take him seriously, Sam is all alone. At the cottage, Harsh sees a woman in red clothes, and when he looks again, the figure disappears. Tanu informs her parents and Rahul that the car has been fixed. Harsh is now alone in the cottage. The lights then begin to flicker violently, and when the power goes out, Harsh goes to find his family. He hears noises which include a girl laughing. After a long search, he finally sees the ghost, the lights come back on and Tanu checks on him. In that specific room, they see some disturbing pictures. In fear, Harsh wants to leave. Meanwhile, as Sam walks on the road, he suddenly spots the same stroller from earlier. He follows it, and then witnesses the ghost girl singing \\"Happy Birthday to Riya\\" with the doll. Sam has an eye-to-eye moment with the girl, and then turns around to get jump-scared by the same woman that Harsh saw. Sam runs for his life until he reaches the cottage, gravely injured and white from the shock. When Sam begins to have a violent nosebleed, Harsh calls for an ambulance, only to hear a woman crying on the receiving end. Tanu begins to experience difficulty breathing for reasons unknown, and Rahul is asked to go get an inhaler. In his state of shock, Sam says \\"the girl\\" before seeing the ghostly woman again and dying as a result. The family suspects that Dev killed Sam as he is the only one missing. Rahul and Harsh put Sam‚Äôs lifeless body in the trunk, and continued their trip. Shalini asks for Sam‚Äôs whereabouts, but Harsh refuses to answer for a moment. Harsh stops the car as Tanu is having her breathing problems again. Shalini is outside too, but now with a gun and demanding for Sam. Shalini sees Sam and follows him and the rest follow Shalini but lose her. Shalini runs behind Sam and goes straight towards a tree, thus losing consciousness. Tanu finds her first. The three, Harsh, Rahul, and Tanu continue the trip. Shalini is put next to Tanu. Harsh sees a ghostly figure between them. Shalini hears Sam calling for her and regains consciousness. She continues to hear Sam and some smacking in the trunk. She asks Harsh to stop the car, while threatening him with death if he refuses to do so. Shalini then jumps out of the car and says \\"you will all die,\\" before dying herself. Shalini also saw the same ghost before dying just as her son did. Now the remaining three members (Harsh, Tanu, and Rahul) continue on the road. Harsh sees signs of Lucknow on the road and asks Rahul to take the car a little back. He is surprised that Lucknow is still 145 miles away despite driving for hours, and that he also sees the board of Dev's cottage. Harsh thinks a lot about what happened and tells Rahul to drive back to the cottage. There, Harsh finds Dev and confronts him about his identity. Dev explains that he is a writer, and the family left their baggage at his home, before asking Harsh the whereabouts of Shalini and Sam. Harsh responds that his wife and son are both deceased. Dev mentions that there was an accident on that road that killed a family of three, and thus confirms all connections regarding the stroller, the little girl, and the doll. Harsh, in guilt, holds himself responsible for the death of his wife and son. Harsh then tells Dev the whole story of what occurred two years prior to the current events and supernatural encounters that lead to the tragic deaths of his wife and son. His biggest competitor was another businessman by the name of Vinod Kumar. One evening, Vinod attended the same company party as Harsh. Harsh was talking with Satish, the same man he had a small heated talk with earlier in the film, expressing how envious he was of Vinod winning the Entrepreneur of The Year award and title. At the party, Harsh meets Vinod‚Äôs family, his wife Geeta dressed in red, and his young daughter Riya with her doll, who invites him to her birthday party. As Vinod and his family left the party to return home, Satish warns Harsh about driving home under the influence of alcohol. Ignoring Satish‚Äôs concern, the drunk Harsh speeds his car and hits Vinod‚Äôs car, causing the vehicle to crash into the Lucknow sign. The Kumar family are gravely injured, but slightly alive. Satish begs Harsh to help Vinod and his family, but he makes no effort to save them, and abandons them for death. Harsh begins to feel guilty and regretful upon the revelation of his actions. There is flickering in the house. He sees the little girl. Dev denies the existence of the spirits. Tanu starts having her breathing problems again but now the inhaler has finished. There is another flickering and a storm. She sees the woman, revealed to be Vinod's wife, Geeta, which everyone sees. Harsh pleads to Geeta's spirit for his daughter's life. He takes his own life with a gun. Geeta spares Tanu's life as her little girl looks at her in such a way. The movie ends with Dev saying that this new experience changed his beliefs about the existence of spirits and a new book that he wrote was titled \\"Lupt\\".

History  At the beginning of the 20th century the house was known in the city as trading house of G.G. Pustovoytov. It was named by last name of the shipowner and the city patron at the expense of whom the house was built in 1910. The construction was carried out according to the project of the architect E. M. Gulin. The trading house was located in the historical part of the city at the intersection of Bolshaya Sadovaya Street and Budennovskiy Avenue. The building housed the \\"London\\" and \\"Central\\" hotels, jewelry and watch shop A. Girshtein. In the old part of the Rostov department store there was a branch of the company \\"Provodnik\\", that central office was in Riga. In Soviet times, the library of the North Caucasian University operated in the house. In the 1940s it was destroyed and rebuilt in 1949 according to the projects of architects P. Kalashnikov and G. A. Petrov. In 1965, an additional wing appeared, designed by the architect Likhobabin. In the 21st century, the Rostov central department store is located in the premises of Pustovoitov's former trading house. Its total area is more than 4000 square meters. The department was reconstructed, the area was enlarged due to the reduction of storage facilities, additional premises were put into exploitation.

The group, or more formally the triple (G,\\\\circ,\\\\mathcal G) is called a measurable group if * the inversion g \\\\mapsto g^{-1} is measurable from \\\\mathcal G to \\\\mathcal G . * the group law (g_1, g_2) \\\\mapsto g_1 \\\\circ g_2 is measurable from \\\\mathcal G \\\\otimes \\\\mathcal G to \\\\mathcal G Here, \\\\mathcal A \\\\otimes \\\\mathcal B denotes the formation of the product œÉ-algebra of the œÉ-algebras \\\\mathcal A and \\\\mathcal B .  Topological groups as measurable groups  Every second-countable topological group (G, \\\\mathcal O) can be taken as a measurable group. This is done by equipping the group with the Borel œÉ-algebra : \\\\mathcal B(G)= \\\\sigma(\\\\mathcal O) , which is the œÉ-algebra generated by the topology. Since by definition of a topological group, the group law and the formation of the inverse element is continuous, both operations are in this case also measurable from \\\\mathcal B(G) to \\\\mathcal B(G) and from \\\\mathcal B(G\\\\times G) to \\\\mathcal B(G) , respectively. Second countability ensures that \\\\mathcal B(G)\\\\otimes \\\\mathcal B(G) = \\\\mathcal B(G\\\\times G) , and therefore the group G is also a measurable group.  Related concepts  Measurable groups can be seen as measurable acting groups that act on themselves.

The shell is subulate and turreted. It shows longitudinal undulations, which on each whorl of the spire are crossed by three equidistant prominent spiral lines. The whorls are indented above. The indentations are finely striated. The suture is margined by a carinated line. The body whorl shows about thirteen spiral lines. The aperture is more than one third the length of the shell. (original description by Conrad in 1834) General Characters.‚ÄîThe shell is rather large and robust. The apertureis approximately one-third the total altitude. The whorls number probably 8 to 10. They are concave posteriorly, straight sided or gently convex in front of the fasciole. The body is smoothly contracted at the base. The appression of the whorls is rather marked. The suture line is inconspicuous. Protoconch.‚ÄîApex broken away in all available material. The nucleus is apparently small. Sculpture.- The external sculpture is vigorous, both axial and spiral. The axial ribs are rather strongly elevated, rounded, somewhat undulatory and slightly protractive, 12 to 14 in number on the later whorls, persisting with undiminished strength to the anterior suture but quite abruptly evanescent posteriorly at the margin of the fasciole. On the body whorl they are weakening a little in front of the periphery and becoming obsolete before reaching the pillar and, in the older forms, irregular or altogether obsolete toward the aperture. Intercostal areas are concave, narrower than the ribs. The spiral sculpture consists of broadly arched, rather prominent, primary fillets, uniform in strength on both the costal and the intercostal areas, 9 to 11 in number on the ultima, 3 or 4 upon the penultima, usually, though not always, equal or sub-equal in size and spacing. The intercalaries are absent in the type but present, as a rule, to the number of 1, 2, or 3 between the primaries of the later whorls. The posterior fasciole is obscurely undulated anteriorly by the axial sculpture, spirally threaded with 4 to 6 fine, close-set lirae with 1 or 2 stronger cords at the posterior margin, directly in front of the suture line. The anterior canal is sculptured with 4 to 6 crowded lirae. Aperture : the aperture is narrow, obliquely lobate, obtusely angulated at the posterior commissure. The outer lip is somewhat flaring. The posterior siphonal notch is very narrow, but rather deep. The inner lip is gently excavated at the base of the body whorl. The columella is straight, moderately long, simple. The parietal wall and the columella are heavily reinforced. The anterior canal is rather long and broad, obtusely truncate at the extremity. s 292 Gardner, Julia A., and T. H. Aldrich.

The object number of cultural heritage of regional significance is 661720976330005.  Architecture  The mansion‚Äôs owner was Kamensk bourgeois Arsenyi Tronin. He made his fortune in hardware. In 1910 he built the mansion for his family. It is one of the first Modern style buildings with the elements of false gothic style and brick lace. The two-story building is located in the historic center of the town. The main northern fa√ßade faces Lenin Street. The facade is divided into four parts by false columns-blades, five of which end in decorative columns in the form of small towers. The central window is wider than the rest. The space above it is decorated with a brick pattern without a single straight line. On both sides are narrower windows. The whole facade is glazed with a vertical belt. Decorative edging with geometric patterns divides the building into floors. On the second floor there must be a wide balcony. The project provided for the third floor, but his master did not have time to complete it. The windows of the third floor are greatly understated. In 1927 they were tightly laid. Initially, there was only one central entrance to the building, through the porch the guests entered the hallway with a small corridor. Directly there was a staircase to the second floor. The house was water heating, units and oven were located in a specially constructed boiler house. To the eastern facade was attached a hardware store, one of the largest in the Kamensk Plant.  History  After the revolutionary events of 1917, the mansion was nationalized. In the 1930s, the building was partially rebuilt for public needs. Subsequently, a rough restoration was carried out, and the walls were built of solid and literal bricks, were plastered. The building was occupied by various organizations: the Consumer Society, the Bureau of Technical Inventory, the Employment Bureau, now the building houses the local JSC \\"Vodokanal\\".

To support the plant, the Yekaterinburg-Shadrinsk-Kurgan railway line running through Kamensk, but located north of the plant at a considerable distance, was used. By 1938 a project was developed for supplying vehicles through a single-span arched railway bridge. The bridge was designed by a Moscow engineer, Professor VA Rosnovsky. The professor conducted scientific research in the field of designing of pipe-concrete bridges (for the design and construction of the railway bridge in Kamensk-Uralsky was awarded the Order of the Red Banner of Labor). The railway bridge is located on the eighth kilometer of the Sinarska-Chelyabinsk railway line in the city of Kamensk- Uralsky. Construction work was carried out from 1938 to 1940. The length of the span of the bridge was 140 meters, the length of the coastal overpass: the left - 56 meters, the right - 42 meters, the boom - 22 meters. It was built by the Mostotrest organization, the manufacture of metal structures and assembly welding were made by the Verkhnaya Salda factory. During the construction, a new technology was used at that time - pipe-concrete, the filling of steel pipes with concrete.

The first wooden building was laid in 1861. The monastery was built until 1864, in which the church was consecrated in the Nativity of Christ. The building was completely destroyed by a fire in 1866. The capital stone temple was built in 1915-1916. In 1937, the priest of the church was shot, Panov Mikhail Stepanovich. In 1939 the church was closed. Restorative work and services began in 2004.  Architecture  The building is an original and rare for the Ural region monument of church architecture of the late \\"Byzantine style\\". The voluminous composition of the building is an octagonal temple part with an adjoining five-edged apse, a porch and a developed covered porch, topped by a bell tower. The system of facade sections reflects the planning structure of the building and follows the rules of order tectonics. Collected in bundles of a full order column (with pedestals) fix the corners of the temple octagon and the porch, visually support the archivolts and entablature covering the building along the perimeter. The dome, \\"Byzantine\\" by the nature of the design, is crowned with the head of the \\"Russian\\" style. The composition of the bell tower was built on a contrasting change in diameter and height from the lower tier to the upper tier of the bell, topped with a hill of kokoshniks and a two-tier bulbous glaucoma.

A figure skating rink is an ice rink designed for figure skating. Alternatively it is used for other sports such as short track speed skating and ice hockey. It is usually rectangular.  Name origins  Rink, a Scottish word meaning 'course', was used as the name of a place where another game, curling, was played. The name has been retained for the construction of ice areas for figure skating.  Basics   Dimensions  The size of figure skating rinks can be quite variable. The International Skating Union (ISU) prefers Olympic-sized rinks for figure skating competitions, particularly for major events. According to Rule 342 of the ISU Special Regulations & Technical Rules: Single & Pair Skating and Ice Dance 2016, an Olympic-sized figure skating rink has dimensions of by if possible, the same with an Olympic-sized short track speed skating rink and an Olympic- sized ice hockey rink, and exactly 44% larger than an Olympic-size swimming pool which has dimensions of by . The scoring system rewards skaters who have good ice coverage, i.e. who efficiently cover the entire ice surface during their programs. Olympic-sized rinks make the differences in skill between skaters more apparent but they are not available for all events. If a rink has different dimensions, a skater's jump setup and speed may be hindered as he or she adjusts.  Ice quality  Ice quality is judged by smoothness, friction, hardness, and brittleness. Factors affecting ice quality include temperature, water quality, and usage, with toe picks causing more deterioration. For figure skating, the ice surface temperature is usually kept between ‚àí5.5 ¬∞C (22 ¬∞F) and ‚àí3.5 ¬∞C (26 ¬∞F), slightly warmer than an ice hockey rink, which means softer ice and easier landings for the figure skaters. Typically after every two warm-up groups during the competitions, an ice resurfacer cleans and smooths the surface of the ice sheet. Inadequate ice quality may affect skaters' performances.  Rinks for competitions   Requirements  According to Rule 342 of the ISU Special Regulations & Technical Rules: Single & Pair Skating and Ice Dance 2016, the available skating area for the short program/short dance, free skating/free dance and pattern dance(s) must be rectangular and if possible, shall measure in length and in width, but not larger, and not less than in length and in width. Officials shall not be seated on the ice surface. The Judges and the Referee will be seated at the rinkboard. If possible, the Technical Panel will be seated in an elevated position. For the international competitions sanctioned by the ISU, at least one covered and preferably heated rink is required. For the ISU Figure Skating Championships, the Winter Olympic Games and the Winter Youth Olympic Games, two covered and closed rinks are required. For the ISU events, the Winter Olympic Games, the Winter Youth Olympic Games and the qualifying competition for the Winter Olympic Games, the ice rinks must be heated.  Kiss and cry  The kiss and cry is the area in a figure skating rink where figure skaters wait for their marks to be announced after their performances during a figure skating competition.\\"kiss-and-cry area\\" definition from Double-Tongued Dictionary It is so named because the skaters and coaches often kiss to celebrate after a good performance, or cry after a poor one. The area is usually located in the corner or end of the rink and is furnished with a bench or chairs for the skaters and coaches and monitors to display the competition results. It is often elaborately decorated with flowers or some other backdrop for television shots and photos of the skaters as they react to their performance and scores.  For the Olympics  Since short track speed skating was contested at the 1992 Winter Olympics, the rinks are used for figure skating and short track speed skating during those Winter Olympic Games.

If Chinlestegophis is indeed both an advanced stereospondyl and a relative of caecilians, this means that stereospondyls (in the form of caecilians) survived to the present day; historically the group was thought to have gone extinct by the early Cretaceous. Chinlestegophis jenkinsi, the type and only species, is known from two partial skulls discovered in the Chinle Formation in Colorado.  History of study  Chinlestegophis was described in 2017 by Jason Pardo, Adam Huttenlocker, and Bryan Small based on two specimens collected in the late 1990s by Small. The genus name is derived from the name of the formation (Chinle), the Greek root stego- ('roof' or 'cover'), and the Greek root -ophis ('serpent'). The species name honors Farish Jenkins, the longtime curator of the Museum of Comparative Zoology at Harvard University who described Eocaecilia, the oldest known caecilian. The taxon is readily diagnosed by numerous features given its distinctive small size and consequent diverging morphology from many contemporaneous stereospondyls; Pardo et al. noted numerous features shared between Chinlestegophis and brachyopoids (e.g., lacrimal-maxilla fusion), Rileymillerus (e.g., lateral exposure of the palate), and caecilians (e.g., double tooth row on the lower jaw).  Relationships  The phylogenetic positions of many small-bodied temnospondyls have often been controversial, including that of the closely related Rileymillerus cosgriffi from the Late Triassic of Texas. The analysis by Pardo et al. (2017) used a modified matrix from Schoch (2013), which looked at the relationships of all temnospondyls. In addition to recovering Chinlestegophis as the sister taxon to Rileymillerus, the authors also recovered these taxa as the closest relatives of brachyopoids, another clade of stereospondyl that were the last non-lissamphibian temnospondyls to survive in the Mesozoic. In turn, the analysis recovered Chinlestegophis as the closest relative to Eocaecilia, the oldest known caecilian. As such, these results form the basis for a fourth major hypothesis regarding lissamphibian origins, namely that all lissamphibians are derived from temnospondyls, but that batrachians (frogs and salamanders) are descended from dissorophoids, whereas caecilians came from Chinlestegophis-like taxa nested among the stereospondyls. Other workers have disputed the interpretation of Chinlestegophis as a stem caecilian on various grounds. For example, Marjanoviƒá & Laurin (2019) note that the original study reported only a Bayesian consensus and a majority-rule consensus tree of the main data matrix, and while both support the claimed caecilian affinities of Chinlestegophis jenkinsi, the strict parsimony consensus tree does not, given that it is compatible with lissamphibian monophyly (indeed, this topology is found in some of the most parsimonious trees); those workers generally favor and recover support for a monophyletic origin of lissamphibians from lepospondyls. The use of a modified version of the Pardo et al. matrix by Schoch et al. (2020) recovered a single origin of all lissamphibians from dissorophoids, consistent with the historic \\"temnospondyl hypothesis.\\"  References  Category:Triassic temnospondyls of North America Category:Middle Triassic first appearances ","title":"Chinlestegophis"},{"id":"57901209","text":"Church of the Holy Prophet Elijah - is an Orthodox church in Smolinskoye village, Sverdlovsk oblast. The church was granted the status of regional significance on the 28th of December 2001 (the Sverdlovsk oblast Government Decree ‚Ññ 859). The object number of cultural heritage of regional significance is 661710759300005.  Description  The first mention of the church building in the Smolin village dates back to the second half of the 18th century, when Archpriest Feodor Kochnev consecrated a wooden church on July 5, 1770. The wooden building was badly damaged by a fire in 1822. Already in 1823 a letter was received for the construction of a new capital building. Today's church building is located in the western part of the village. The temple is a model of the buildings of late classicism and at the same time an example of baroque traditions of the Urals in the second half of the XIX century. The church is stone, three-table, Sergius. Construction started in 1823. The main temple was consecrated on June 11, 1847, by the letter of Arkady, bishop of Perm in the name of the Prophet Elijah by the local priest Matii Popov. The right limit was consecrated on November 6, 1877 in honor of the Exaltation of the Cross of the Lord, the left limit was consecrated on November 2, 1881 in the name of the Great Martyr Dmitry Solunsky. In 1887-1893 the iconostasis was renovated, the walls of the main church were painted. In 1895 the building was plastered and bleached. The parish included a chapel in the village of Perebor in the name of St. Stephen, bishop of Perm and a wooden cross at the Smolin caves. The maintenance of the church was allocated 19 rubles annually from the funds of church stores. Also in the village of Perebor since 1892 there was a school of reading and writing. The building was closed in 1940. Currently not restored, half-destroyed.

As a two-year-old in 1886 he was one of the best horses of his generation in England, winning the New Stakes and the July Stakes as well as finishing second in the Middle Park Plate and the Dewhurst Plate. In the following spring he recorded his biggest victory when winning the 2000 Guineas as the 2/1 favourite. He was one of the leading fancies for the Epsom Derby but missed the race after sustaining an injury in training. He remained in training until the end of 1888 but failed to recover his best form. He made no impact as a breeding stallion. Background Enterprise was a chestnut horse bred at the Yardley stud near Birmingham by the Graham brothers. As a yearling he was offered for sale and bought for bought for 2,000 guineas by Douglas Baird. He was trained at Newmarket, Suffolk by James Ryan. His sire, Sterling, was a successful racehorse who became an excellent sire whose other offspring included Isonomy, Paradox, Enthusiast and Harvester. Enterprise's dam, an unnamed mare sired by King Tom, was a full-sister to the Epsom Derby runner-up King Alfred. Racing career 1886: two-year-old season On 8 June Enterprise made his racecourse debut in the New Stakes at Royal Ascot. He was ridden by George Barrett and won at odds of 100/12 upsetting the hot favourite Freedom. He was expected to follow up in the Royal Plate at Windsor Racecourse but was defeated by George Chetwynd's colt Stetchworth. At Newmarket Racecourse on 6 July, the colt started 2/1 joint-favourite for the July Stakes. Ridden by Fred Archer he took the lead soon after the start and despite hanging left just inside the last quarter mile he won \\"easily\\" by four lengths from Hugo. On 13 October at Newmarket Enterprise finished second to Lord Calthorpe's colt Florentine in the Middle Park Plate, a race for which he had been regarded as a near certainty and started at odds of 1/7. In the Dewhurst Plate two weeks later over seven furlongs at the same track he started 7/2 second favourite behind Phil. After disputing the lead for most of the way he appeared to \\"cut it\\" (give up) in the final furlong and was beaten three lengths into second place by the Duke of Beaufort's filly Reve d'Or, a 20/1 outsider. At the end of year Fred Archer reportedly said \\"If he hadn't had a touch of the white feather, Enterprise would be a second Ormonde\\". 1887: three-year-old season Tom Cannon, who rode Enterprise to victory in the 2000 Guineas On 27 April 1887, Enterprise, ridden by Tom Cannon started the 2/1 favourite for the 79th running of the 200 Guineas over the Rowley Mile. Phil (10/1), Florentine (10/1) and Hugo (20/1) were again in opposition but the best fancied of his opponents were Eglamore, Grandison (Windsor Castle Stakes) and Lovegold. Enterprise started well and as the field entered the last quarter mile he moved into third place behind Eglamore and Phil, with the three colts drawing well clear of the rest. Racing in the centre of the trio, he gained the advantage inside the final furlong and won \\"rather easily\\" in \\"capital style\\" by half a length from Phil with Eglamore the same distance away in third place. Despite the close finish, Cannon always appeared to be in control of the race ensuring that Baird and his associates collected very large sums in winning bets. The winning time of 1:45.6 constituted a new record for the race. Enterprise was strongly fancied for the Epsom Derby, being quoted at odds of 9/4 a week before the race. When engaged in training on the Limekilns gallop the colt reportedly took fright, jumped a hedge onto a road and had to be retrieved from an adjacent field. Although he \\"wrenched\\" himself, the initial prognostications were good, but he was subsequently withdrawn from the contest. 1888: four-year-old season On 27 July 1888 Enterprise started the 100/12 third choice in the betting for the Eclipse Stakes at Sandown Park but finished sixth behind the Duke of Westminster's colt Orbit. On 22 September the colt started a 33/1 outsider for the ¬£11,000 Lancashire Plate over seven furlongs at Manchester Racecourse and came home unplaced behind Seabreeze. Stud record After his retirement from racing Enterprise became a breeding stallion but had very little success as a sire of winners. He was the damsire of King James, who won the Prix d'H√©douville in 1907.

His career has been characterized by the promotion and preservation of Venezuelan wildlife and nature. His research and collaboration with the herpetologist Peter Pritchard produced the still extant reference book on the turtles of Venezuela. Biography Children's Zoo TV Show Pedro Trebbau Trebbau was born in Cologne, where he very early on showed a keen interest in the natural world. He obtained bachelor's degree in Biology at the universities of Frankfurt and Freiburg, as well as Veterinary degree from the University of Giessen. He arrived in Venezuela in 1953 and enrolled at the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine of the Central University of Venezuela (UCV), based in Maracay, Aragua. Shortly afterwards he decided to remain in Venezuela, and obtained the Venezuelan nationality in 1957.Albor Rodr√≠guez: TREBBAU. Maestro por naturaleza. Venezuela: Ediciones La Fauna KPT, 2018. . His work in Venezuela began as a technical director of El Pinar Zoo, in Caracas. Between 1965 and 1970 he also worked as a professor at the Institute of Tropical Zoology of the UCV. In 1968 he led an expedition and rescue operation in the region of Guayana that protected an estimated 10.000 animals of 53 different species that would have drowned as a result of the construction of the Guri Dam. In 1974 Trebbau accomplished the endowment and foundation of the first modern zoo in Venezuela. Eventually called Caricuao Zoo, it was inaugurated in 1977 and Trebbau remained as its president until 1979. He would then set his sight to work as the zoo coordinator for the National Parks Institute (Inparques), and as Special Commissioner for the Ministry of Environment. From 1980 to 1983 he was president of the Humboldt Cultural Association. In 1989 he took an active role on the advisory committee for a new Wildlife Law, and in 1991 he became president of the National Foundation of Zoological Parks and Aquariums.Catharine E. Bell, Laura Mizicko, Lester Fisher: Encyclopedia of the World's Zoos (p√°g. 1575). UK: Taylor & Francis, 2001. . Trebbau produced and hosted several TV programs aimed at the dissemination of the knowledge of the local fauna, especially among the younger generations. Among these Zool√≥gico Infantil (Children's zoo), La Fauna (The Wildlife) and Campamento en la Selva (Jungle Camp), were broadcast by the former National Television-Channel 5 and Venezolana de Televisi√≥n for several years. His scientific research has been widely published in technical journals around the world; but he is most proud of his role as a disseminator of the local knowledge of the fauna to the local population. For him, the entertainment role of zoos was always secondary to its role as an educational and research producing institution. Works *Roze, J.A.; P.

Systermans was previously suspended from the Conseil de l'Ordre in 1980 and afterwards sentenced for embezzlement and then forgery, before carrying out his attack on the courthouse. At court accused of manslaughter, Systermans confessed that he was the perpetrator of the bombing. Systermans had previously been the lawyer of several Li√®ge arms dealers.

It was the first Italian video game console, excluding Magnavox Odyssey imports and clones. It came in an orange and white plastic container with a paddles housing. The control logic is based on three 7400 chips. Usable games are only three similar ones: Pong, Squash/Solo and Automatic/Attract. The last one was the only game that did not require players and was used by stores to demonstrate the system without having anyone play it. There are several versions of this console, marked by the abbreviations PP-1 up to PP-10. Starting from the PP-5, there was a new slot to which an optical gun could be connected to play a new aiming game. This accessory was called Gun-O-Tronic (stylized as gun ‚Ä¢ o ‚Ä¢ tronic). The only other known consoles at the time which allowed the user to play target shooting games were the Magnavox Odyssey and Philips Tele-Game ES 2201. On April 21, 1975, Zanussi obtained the license to implement Pong from Sanders Associates.  Play-O-Tronic  Play-O-Tronic In 1977, Zanussi produced and sold a new model of a Pong-like console called Play-O-Tronic (stylized as play ‚Ä¢ o ‚Ä¢ tronic and also known as Zanussi Play-O-Tronic or S√®leco Play-O-Tronic). Unlike the Ping-O-Tronic, which was built with discrete components, the Play-O-Tronic was built from a single AY-3-8500 chip.http://www.pong-story.com/zanussi.htm Dal sito pong-story The console was also sold in Germany by German mailorder company Quelle, who sold the console under the name Universum TV Multi-Spiel (stylized as UNIVERSUM TV Multi- Spiel). A built-in power supply comes with the Multi-Spiel.  Sales  Zanussi was reported to have sold 21,514 units of the Play-O-Tronic from October 1, 1977 to December 31, 1977 and earned a total of 620,408,000 Italian lira (US$127,782,334), of which 5.5%, 34,122,440 lira (US$7,028,028) went to Sanders Associates. When calculating and considering sales margins, it can be assumed that each console costed between 70,000 and 130,000 lira.

Healthcare is universal in Portugal. The public service, the National Healthcare Service (Servi√ßo Nacional de Sa√∫de, or SNS), is accessible to all people, albeit with different billing conditions. From November 3, 2019 many more people will be entitled to become SNS beneficiaries (basically, everyone who resides in Portugal, including people with irregular residence status; incarcerated people; holders of temporary stay visas...). It's not yet clear which procedures will be adopted, nor when, for services to implement the new law.  Universal access to healthcare  The Constitution of the Portuguese Republic states, on its section 64, paragraph 3, item a), that \\"in order to ensure the right to health protection, it is primarily the responsibility of the State to ensure that all citizens, irrespective of their economic condition, have access to preventive, curative and rehabilitative care\\". Portugal's Basic Health Law (Law 48/90) states on its Base II, paragraph 1, item b), that \\"it is a fundamental objective to achieve equality of citizens in access to health care, irrespective of their economic condition and wherever they live\\". Law 93/2017 ‚Äì that establishes the legal system for the prevention, prohibition and combating of discrimination on the basis of racial and ethnic origin, color, nationality, ancestry and territory of origin ‚Äì states that discriminatory actions include \\"the refusal or limitation of access to health care provided in public or private health facilities\\" (section 4, paragraph 2, item e)). Access to public healthcare services cannot, thus, be denied, and especially not by clerks and administrative personnel ‚Äì even to people who decline to pay expenses bills ‚Äì, for they aren't neither trained nor mandated to perform triage.  Payments  There are two types of payments: fees and expenses. Fees (taxas moderadoras) are symbolic values charged to SNS beneficiaries (people with an SNS beneficiary number, or numero de utente) and to people who are entitled to being billed in the same conditions in certain situations (holders of documents that confer them such right ‚Äì e.g., holders of a European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) access care for unforeseen situations or for chronic conditions as if they had an SNS number. For people without a SNS number there are, however, difficulties in accessing care at low cost in private providers that operate under an agreement with the SNS (e.g. clinical laboratories) or in buying subsidised medication at community pharmacies. Expenses (despesas incorridas) are larger sums, or the \\"full price\\", charged to other people: tourists without an EHIC, people with a temporary stay visa to accompany a relative that's getting specialised care in Portugal, people who choose to use their private insurance... Both the values for the expenses and the fees are determined by an ordinances (Portarias). Some beneficiaries are exempt from paying fees due to personal circumstances: minors, pregnant people, firefighters, among others. SNS public servants may and should try to collect pre-payment of expenses or symbolic fees (depending on which applies to a given person and/or situation), except when the person is not able to pay due to their clinical situation (e.g. when it's obvious the person needs urgent medical care), or due lack of means to pay (e.g., when the person informs that they don't have money and will pay later), and also when internal rules of the service determine that no charges shall be made (e.g., special consultations for screening and treatment of sexually transmitted infections). Not being able (or willing) to pay up front cannot be used as motive to deny access to services. Payments may be made at a later time and installment payment agreements are possible. Even without entering such an agreement people are allowed to make partial payments to mitigate their debt. Not paying (or asking for correction of the expense bill) in due time may lead to charging of late payment interest. Between June 22, 2012 and December 31, 2016 not paying the fees in the 10 days after receiving the notification to do so was an administrative offense, punishable with a fine (and, if not paid, a forfeiture of wages). Since January 1, 2017 that no longer applies but default interest is charged. From January 1, 2020 fees will no longer be charged in primary healthcare units (Centros de Saude), nor in other healthcare situations whenever the person is referenced to such care by SNS services.  People with irregular residency status  People whom don't have a residency title (card) yet and have overstayed their time limit for legal permanence in Portugal may access some types of healthcare in the same billing conditions that apply to SNS beneficiaries.  Minors  If the child was born in Portugal and, if at least one of the parents has Portuguese citizenship, or if at least one of the parents has been a holder of a valid residency title for at least two years, or if at least one of the parents was also born in Portugal and lives in the country (regardless of having a residency title or not when their child was born), the minor(s) are entitled to Portuguese nationality. If the child was born in Portugal and, if at least one of the parents has been a holder of a valid residency title for less than two years, the minor is entitled to a residency title. Minors with irregular status are entitled to access healthcare for free with a special document (that mus be renovated every two years) but some rules apply in order to get it.  Adults  Despacho n.¬∫ 25360/2001 came to institute that, to all foreign citizens residing legally in Portugal, access be granted in equality of treatment given to beneficiaries of the SNS concerning health care and medication assistance provided by the institutions and services that comprise the SNS. In practice this led to issuance of beneficiary numbers (\\"n√∫mero de utente\\") to holders of residence permits. It also states that people in irregular situation of stay that have been residing for more than 90 days in Portugal (proved by means of a residence certificate issued by a Junta de Freguesia). Often Juntas de Freguesia issue certificates that don't declare the person has been living in the country for more than 90 days; when this happens health services still accept the document and check the arrival date stamped on the passport to check if more that 90 days have passed. Also often Juntas de Freguesia demand two witnesses (voters registered in that freguesia) to declare the veracity of the information; this is illegal but customary, and probably derives of ill interpretation of the change.  People with residency title  Update coming soon.  Nationals of European Union Member-States, of Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, and Switzerland  Update coming soon.  Holders of documents granting equal rights under bilateral agreements  Update coming soon.  Other situations  Update coming soon.

The treaty aimed to solve the so-called \\"The Mosul question\\" by determining a mutually satisfactory borders between Turkey and Iraq and to regulate their neighbourly relations. One important aspect of the treaty was that Turkey would have the right to engage in militarily conflict in the border region in the event of it being destabilised. This sphere of influence which is beyond Turkey's modern boundaries mainly covers northern part of Iraq, notably the Mosul and Kirkuk region.  The treaty  * The Mosul province will belong to Iraq * The \\"Brussel line\\" as adopted previously in 1924 as provisional border will act as the border between Turkey and Iraq. * 10% of the oil revenues from Mosul, Iraq will be given to Turkey for 25 years. * Turkey has received this payment for 4 years, and gives up on the remaining 21 years of payment in favour of a payment of ¬£500,000 Sterlings from the United Kingdom.

In marine biology, a flukeprint is a patch of calm water on the surface of the ocean, formed by the passing of a whale. Flukeprints may also be named by the word for them in the Inupiaq language, qala. As with other forms of animal tracks, flukeprints may be used in hunting, to follow whales that are invisible beneath the ocean surface, and to determine the size of an unseen whale. They have also been used for similar purposes by scientists studying whales. Fluid dynamics researchers have proposed multiple mechanisms for the formation of flukeprints, including vortex shedding from the fluke of the whale, the action of surfactants on the surface of the water, and shear flow in the interaction between water waves and the current caused by the passing whale.

Each NOC could enter a maximum of eight karatekas (one in each division). Host nation Japan has reserved a spot in each of all 8 events, while four are made available to NOCs through a Tripartite Commission Invitation. Summary The 10 competitors in each event qualify as follows: * 1 from the host nation, Japan * 4 from the Olympic Standing ranking of 6 April 2020 * 3 from a qualification tournament * 2 from continental representation or Tripartite Commission invitation Because the World Karate Federation rankings are based on five weight classes instead of the three weight classes featured in the 2020 Olympics, some of the Olympic events are based on a combination of two WKF classes. In those cases, the top 2 from each of the WKF classes qualify for the combined Olympic class (for a total of 4). Where the Olympic class matches the WKF class, the top 4 in that class qualify. The qualification tournament features the same weight classes as the Olympic weight classes. Only NOCs that have not qualified through Olympic standing for a given division are eligible to enter an athlete in the qualification tournament. The top three finishers in each division at the qualification tournament qualify for the Olympics. A total of 12 quota places, distributed among the eight events, are available through continental representation. The selection order is as follows: * Oceania, 2 spots (1 per gender) * Africa, 2 spots (1 per gender) * Americas, 2 spots (1 per gender) * Asia, 2 spots (1 per gender) * Europe, 2 spots (1 per gender) * Africa, 1 spot (either gender) * Americas, 1 spot (the other gender) For each continent, all of the gold medalists at the continental games are considered together. The highest-ranked among this group earns the qualification spot unless that competitor is already qualified or otherwise cannot be selected without violating any of the following limitations: 10 athletes per division, 1 athlete per NOC per division, 2 athletes per NOC through continental representation (affecting only Africa and the Americas). If the highest-ranked gold medalist cannot be entered, then the next-highest ranked gold medalist qualifies if possible. This process goes through all gold medalists by ranking, then all silver medalists by ranking, then all bronze medalists by ranking until the continent's qualifying spots are filled. If none of the medalists can be entered, the highest-ranked eligible athlete from that continent in the rankings (regardless of finish at the continental games) qualifies. The final four quota spots will be assigned through Tripartite Commission invitation.

Biography Abdol Hossein Hamzavi was born 20 January 1910 in Tehran, Iran. After receiving his primary and secondary schooling in his homeland of Iran, Abdol Hossein Hamzavi relocated to Great Britain to study English literature. His entry into civil service began when he was appointed cultural attach√© of the Iranian Embassy, responsible for student affairs. He eventually became a cultural advisor. During WWII, and after the occupation of his country by the allied troops, Hamzavi focused his energy on promoting Iran as a centerpiece for the final victory against the Axis powers. He was the first to suggest that Iran be recognized as \\"Pol-e Pirouzi\\" or \\"The Victory Bridge\\" for Iran's role as a regional terminus for equipment transfer and armament for the United States. Hamzavi later served as Spokesman of the Court, Deputy Prime Minister, Deputy Minister of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Director of Iranian Radio and representative to the United Nations. While serving as minister to the UN, Hamzavi was famously quoted in the US papers as stating, \\"Women should be cherished, respected and shielded from unpleasant things -- like voting.\\" He was named as Ambassador to Brazil and Thailand, Malaysia and Laos. before finishing his career as Ambassador to Japan. In 1948 Hamzavi married Lella Margaret Crankshaw, the daughter of Sir Eric Norman Spencer Crankshaw, Secretary of the Government Hospitality Fund for England (1929-1949). The couple had a daughter, Jasmina Hilton, an actress who had a role in the horror film The Vault of Horror. Jasmina initially began her acting career using her maiden name of Hamzavi, and was a prot√©g√© of Orson Welles using that name, but later changed to using her married name. Hamzavi died in England on 3 March 1979. For his service, Hamzavi received numerous Iranian and foreign decorations, including the Order of Homayoun (1st class) and Great Britain's Knight Commander of St. Michael and St George. Bibliography Hamzavi authored more than 800 articles and the following books: * Henceforth Iran, published 1936 under the name Abdol Hossain Hamzavi * Persia and the Powers: An Account of Diplomatic Relations 1941-1946, published 1946 under the name AH Hamzavi * Land reform in Iran: A country in metamorphosis, published 1971 * The Prophetic Light, published 1977 References Sources * The Prophetic Light, Privately published by John Weatherhill, Tokyo, Inc Publication, 1977 * Abdol Hossein Hamzavi on French Wikipedia Category:1910 births Category:1975 deaths Category:Government ministers of Iran Category:Iranian writers Category:People from Tehran ","title":"Abdol Hossein Hamzavi"},{"id":"57902372","text":"This article details the qualifying phase for modern pentathlon at the 2020 Summer Olympics. Thirty-six athletes per gender must qualify for the Games, with only a maximum of two each per NOC. Qualification methods are similarly applied to both men's and women's events. Host nation Japan has been guaranteed one quota place automatically, while two invitational positions are distributed by the UIPM once the rest of the qualifiers are announced and thereby decided. The initial distribution of berths to the athletes based on competition results occur between February and September 2019. One place will be handily awarded to the winner of the 2019 UIPM World Cup final. Twenty places are determined by the continental championships: one each from Africa and Oceania, five from Asia, eight from Europe, and five from the Americas with a maximum of one quota per NOC (two winners each from NORCECA and South America, and the highest-ranked from the 2019 Pan American Games in Lima, Peru). Three places have been reserved to the highest-ranked athletes at each of the 2019 and 2020 UIPM World Championships. The remaining six will be awarded based on the pentathlon's world rankings, unless a reallocation of unused berths have been invoked before the deadline.

Headquartered in Tampa, Florida, the MRS was formed in 1974 as the E.O.R.T.C. Metastasis Club by Bavarian clinical pharmacologist Kurt Hellmann and Director of the Mario Negri Institute for Pharmacological Research Silvio Garattini. It took its current name in the mid-1980s, with its first international meeting as a formal society in 1984 in London. The MRS publishes several journals, including Clinical & Experimental Metastasis, Angiogenesis, and Cancer and Metastasis Reviews. Cancer and Metastasis Reviews, which has an impact factor of 6.081 in 2018, launched in 1982 to critically review and discuss challenges around cancer studies and therapeutic research. Clinical & Experimental Metastasis was launched 1983 and has an impact factor of 3.455 as of 2018. The journal covers metastasis research in multiple disciplines that focus on preventing and treating metastasis formation. Angiogenesis was launched in 1997 as a multidisciplinary rapid disseminator of information about the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which angiogenesis is controlled. As of 2018, it has an impact factor of 4.351. The society sponsors a biennial International Metastasis Research Congress where it presents its highest award, the Paget- Ewing Award for excellent research in cancer metastasis. Named for Stephen Paget and James Ewing, the first awards were bestowed on Dale Rex Cowan and Irwing Zeidman for their pioneering work in the field at the 2nd International Metastasis Congress in Heidelberg in 1988, an event attended by 400 scientists from 22 countries.

It's the highest point in the Tatoosh Wilderness, a protected area which is managed by Gifford Pinchot National Forest. The name tatoosh derives from Chinook Jargon which means breast. Precipitation runoff from the peak drains into tributaries of the Cowlitz River. Climate Tatoosh Peak is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. Tatoosh Peak from west Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range (Orographic lift), causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades. As a result, the west side of the North Cascades experiences high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. Due to its temperate climate and proximity to the Pacific Ocean, areas west of the Cascade Crest very rarely experience temperatures below or above .Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. Because of maritime influence, snow tends to be wet and heavy, resulting in high avalanche danger.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes.

Author Martha Hardy wrote about her experiences keeping watch at the fire lookout in her 1947 book Tatoosh. Hiking Tatoosh Peak is accessible from the south via the Tatoosh Trail (#161). A spur (#161A) of the Tatoosh Trail extends to the location of a former fire lookout that Martha Hardy wrote about, although only the foundations of the lookout building remain.

Sculptural composition  The sculptural composition illustrates the story of the writer of the same name and represents pathetic, trying to take cover not from a rain and wind, not from the torments and fears of the teacher Belikov. It is installed before a facade of the left wing of the Taganrog men's classical gymnasium in which Anton Chekhov studied and one of Belikov's prototypes, \\"the Man in a case\\" worked. The exact prototype of Belikov is unknown. Some contemporaries (including V.G. Bogoraz and M.P. Chekhov) considered that the teacher of Ancient Greek language and the inspector of the Taganrog gymnasium A.F. Dyakonov was a prototype of \\"the person in a case\\", others described the traits of character of Dyakonov disproving opinion of the first. So, P.P. Filevsky noted Dyakonov's generosity and wrote: \\"I positively claim that between \\"The man in a case\\" and A.F. Dyakonov there is nothing in common and no local color can be found in this work by A.P. Chekhov\\". The cost of the municipal budget for the manufacture of sculpture and its installation amounted to 723,802 rubles. The monument is a municipal property.  History of creation  On the eve of the Chekhov's anniversary, the city administration held a competition for the creation of this sculpture, in which David Begalov defeated. The monument was inaugurated on January 27, 2010, during the events dedicated to the A.P. Chekhov's 150 anniversary.

On September 12, 2018, the United States Senate confirmed Rettig's nomination to be Commissioner for the term expiring November 12, 2022. Rettig was sworn in on October 1, 2018. Education Rettig earned a Bachelor of Arts in economics from University of California, Los Angeles, a Juris Doctor from the Pepperdine University School of Law, and an LL.M. in Taxation at the New York University School of Law. Career Rettig was a partner at the Beverly Hills tax controversy law firm of Hochman, Salkin, Rettig, Toscher & Perez, P.C. He worked at the firm for over 36 years, where he represented individuals and corporations before federal and state taxing authorities. The firm has 10 attorneys and was established in 1960.

He was President of the American College of Tax Counsel (ACTC); was Chair of the 4,000+ member Taxation Section of the State Bar of California from 1999 to 2000; the longtime Chair of the UCLA Extension Annual Tax Controversy Institute; and served as Vice-Chair, Administration, for the 12,000+ member Taxation Section of the American Bar Association. In 2010‚Äì2011, Rettig was appointed by the IRS to serve as Chairman of the IRS Advisory Council (IRSAC) for the last year of his three-year term. The IRSAC's primary purpose is to provide an organized public forum for senior IRS executives and representatives of the public to discuss relevant tax administration issues. In his home state of California, Rettig was a longtime member of the California FTB Advisory Board. He was designated a Certified Specialist in Taxation Law by the State Bar of California, Board of Legal Specialization and also designated a Certified Specialist in Estate Planning, Trust & Probate Law by the State Bar of California, Board of Legal Specialization.

During his confirmation hearing before the Senate Finance Committee on June 28, 2018, Rettig \\"told lawmakers he would ensure that the agency is 'impartial and non-biased from top to bottom' and follows the law.\\" The committee approved his nomination on July 19, 2018. Rettig's nomination was confirmed by the full Senate by a vote of 64‚Äì33 on September 12, 2018. Secretary Mnuchin administered the oath of office to Rettig on October 1, 2018.

Relationship to Trump administration  In 2016, prior to being nominated to his post in the IRS by Trump, Rettig wrote an op-ed in Forbes defending Trump's decision not to release his tax returns. The piece also critiqued the work of what Rettig called a \\"wealth squad\\" within the IRS that targeted high-income individuals for audits. At his nomination, Rettig received criticism for failing to disclose roughly a million dollars worth of rental income he had made from Trump-branded hotel rental units.  Other activities  Rettig is active in numerous civic and philanthropic activities. He co-founded the UCLA Extension Vets Count Scholarship Fund, designed to provide scholarships for active duty and retired military personnel who are working to realize their career goals in tax, accounting, wealth management, and other areas of the financial services industry as well as basic coursework for personal growth in budgeting, financial literacy, and investing.

She was best known for her journalism and her later artist's career creating shell pictures. Early life Patricia Cockburn was born Patricia Evangeline Anne Arbuthnot on 17 March 1914 at Derry House, Rosscarbery, County Cork. She was the youngest of the six children of Major John Bernard Arbuthnot and Olive Blake, daughter of Lady Edith Blake and Sir Henry Arthur Blake. Her father served in the Scots Guards during World War I. The family inherited the Blake fortune through Olive once her brothers were cut out of her parent's will. In 1916, the family moved in with Lady Blake at Myrtle Grove, Youghal. The Arbuthnots moved to London in 1918, leaving Cockburn to live with her grandmother. Whilst in Myrtle Grove, she received no formal education, spending her time horse-riding. She joined her parents in London in 1922 to start school. When in London, she was a witness to the murder of Sir Henry Wilson, 1st Baronet. Cockburn was unhappy at school and missed her life in the countryside. She stopped eating, inspired by Terence MacSwiney, and was returned to Cork with a governess. After the death of Lady Blake in 1926, her parents returned to Myrtle Grove but did not live there continuously. Cockburn remained there, ceasing her school lessons at 14 to concentrate on her horse-riding. On her 16th birthday, however, she was thrown from a horse and broke her back. During her recovery she moved to Algiers, living with Clare Sheridan. Upon returning to London in 1931, Cockburn made her appearance as a debutante and started her studies at Westminster School of Art. Later in life she reflected that she \\"was no Michelangelo\\", which led to her switching her course to study design. It was while studying that Cockburn met the Lloyds underwriter, Arthur Byron. The couple married on 10 October 1933 which led to Cockburn leaving her artistic studies. The couple lived briefly in Clarendon Place, Bayswater before taking a world tour. When the couple returned to London in 1936, Cockburn gave birth to a son, Darrell. Career and family Cockburn accepted a brief from the Royal Geographical Society to compile an etymological report on the dialects of central Africa. The couple left their son with her parents, and travelled to the Ituri Rainforest. She constructed a language map by meeting different tribes. She was not a linguist, but instead used observation and pragmatism. Her photographs were exhibited in London. Having returned to London, Cockburn was preparing to rejoin her son in Cork, when Darrell had an accident which resulted in blood poisoning. She suffered a period of depression from the grief and guilt over her son's death. Her next commission came from the Evening Standard in early 1939, writing a series of articles on the newly independent Ruthenia. By this time her marriage to Byron was over, with the couple divorcing in 1939, and having returned to London she met and fell in love with Claud Cockburn. Her parents objected to the relationship, and cut her off when she married him in 1940. When she fell pregnant, her parents resumed contact, but it is not clear why they reinstated her allowance. In contrast to her early life, she and Claud often struggled for money throughout their marriage. While her husband travelled, Cockburn edited his newspaper The Week in 1945. Cockburn grew tired of London, and in 1947 the family returned to Cork, where her brother and parents were living. Having initially lived in Myrtle Grove, the Cockburns moved into Brook Lodge, a Georgian house nearby. As the house was practically derelict, they rented it for a nominal fee. Cockburn installed a cesspit and created a garden, as well as schooling ponies she purchased from Travellers and sold on to buyers in England. She published her first book in 1968, The Years of The Week, about her husband's paper. Later life Cockburn returned to art as a career later in life. She began making shell pictures, a form of art which had been popular in the 18th century and had fallen out of fashion. Encouraged by her friends Desmond Guinness and Norah McGuinness, Cockburn took it up professionally exhibiting in Ireland and New York. When the lease on Brook Lodge ended in 1980, the Cockburns moved to a smaller property in Ardmore, County Waterford. Claud died in 1981, with Cockburn living in Ardmore for the rest of her life. She became president of the local chapter of the Irish Countrywomen's Association. She published her memoir, Figure of Eight, in 1985. Cockburn died on 6 October 1989 in Mercy University Hospital, Cork, from cancer. She was buried beside her husband in the graveyard of Collegiate Church of St Mary Youghal, under a tree planted by her mother in memory of her brother. All three of the Cockburns' sons became journalists: Alexander, Andrew, and Patrick. Through Andrew she was the paternal grandmother of actress Olivia Wilde.

The powdered or hairless line-shaped to somewhat sickle-shaped leaves are 3‚Äì6 cm (1.2‚Äì2.4 in) long and 2‚Äì5 mm (0.08‚Äì0.20 in) wide. The stalked, individually set flower heads are globe-shaped, 2¬Ω‚àí3 cm (1.0‚àí1.2 in) in diameter consist of initially white to pale cream flowers that eventually turn carmine. From the center of the flowers emerge straight styles that jointly give the impression of a pincushion. It is called white-trailing pincushion in English. It flowers from August to January, peaking in September. It is an endemic species that is restricted to a narrow strip on the south coast of the Western Cape province of South Africa.  Description  Leucospermum pedunculatum is a low spreading shrub of 15‚Äì30 cm (¬Ω‚Äì1 ft) high, that forms dense mats of up to 3 m (10 ft) in diameter, that grows from a single stout upright main stem, of up to about 30 cm (1 ft) high and 1‚Äì15 cm (0.4‚Äì6 in) in diameter. This gives rise to stout, horizontally spreading branches. The powdery hairy flowering stems at the edge of the mat, are slender, 2‚Äì3 mm (0.08‚Äì0.12 in) thick, and carry short side branches that each produce a flower head at their tip. The leaves are line-shaped, sometimes somewhat sickle-shaped, 3‚Äì6 cm (1.2‚Äì2.4 in) long and 2‚Äì5 mm (0.08‚Äì0.20 in) wide, hairless to very finely powdery, well spaced from each other, on trailing stems sometimes directed upwards. They are bright green in the west, and more olive-coloured in the east of its distribution, where it is also more upright. The flower heads are globe-shaped, 2¬Ω‚àí3 cm (1.0‚àí1.2 in) in diameter, mostly set individually, with a prominent stalk peduncle of 2‚Äì4 cm (0.8‚Äì1.6 in) long. The common base of the flowers in the same head are very low conic, almost flat, about 4 mm (0.16 in) high and 7 mm (0.28 in) across. The bracts that subtend the flower head are lance-shaped with a pointy tip (or acuminate), about 6 mm (0.24 in) long and 1¬Ω mm (0.06 in) wide, cartilaginous in consistency, set with straight hairs, rather loosely overlapping, and the tips slightly curved back. The bract that subtends the individual flower is inverted lance-shaped, about 7 mm (0.28 in) long and 2 mm (0.08 in) wide, the tip drawn to a point, the margins inclosing the flower at the foot, and the outer surface densely woolly hairy. The 4-merous perianth is straight, in bud cylinder-shaped, initially white to pale cream, but changing to carmine. The lower part with the lobes fused (called tube) is about 7 mm (0.28 in) long, powdery higher up, but hairless and narrower at base. The middle part where all four lobes become free when the flower opens (called claws), are all equally recurved higher up and set with straight hairs. The higher part of the lobes (called limbs) is narrowly lance- shaped with a recurved pointy tip, about 2 mm (0.08 in) long, and set on the outside with upright, stiff hairs. The style is straight, 1¬æ‚Äì2 cm long, initially pale cream later becoming carmine coloured. The slightly thickened tip called pollen presenter is pointy cylinder-shaped, slightly cleft, about 1¬Ω mm (0.06 in) long, with the groove that acts as the stigma across the very tip. Subtending the ovary are four opaque, line-shaped scales of about 1 mm (0.04 in) long. The flowers of Leucospermum pedunculatum are sweetly scented.  Differences with related species  L. pedunculatum differs from Leucospermum prostratum by the stern, upright main stem of up to 30 cm (1 ft) high and 15 cm across, the horizontal branches that carry the flowering stems, on which short side branches that end in one flower head, the bright green leaves, and the creamy white (later carmine) flowers, with styles of 1¬æ‚Äì2 cm long. L. prostratum has branches that emerge from the ground, leaves initially greyish green but later dull olive-green, yellow flowers that age to orange and styles of 1‚Äì1¬Ω cm long.  Taxonomy  As far as we know, the white- trailing pincushion was first collected for science in 1838 by Johan Carl Krauss. Johann Friedrich Klotzsch described it in Krauss‚Äô book Beitr√§ge zur Flora des Cap- und Natallandes [Contribution to the Flora of the lands of the Cape and Natal] that was published in 1845. Both Carl Meissner and Edwin Percy Phillips considered it to be synonymous with L. saxatile. In 1891 Otto Kuntze reassigned all known species of Leucospermum to the genus Leucadendron, a view that received little support by later authors. John Patrick Rourke confirmed the distinctness of the white-trailing pincushion. L. pedunculatum has been assigned to the louse pincushions, section Diastelloidea. The species name pedunculatum means ‚Äúhaving an inflorescence stalk‚Äù.  Distribution, habitat and ecology  L. pedunculatum occurs on the south coast of the Western Cape province in a narrow strip between Cape Agulhas (Springfonteyn) in the southeast and Danger Point (Franskraal) in the west, of at most 6¬Ω km (4 mi) from the sea and 200 m (600 ft) altitude. It mostly grows on white sandy flats of Tertiary or Quaternary origin rimming the limestone ridges parallel to the sea. Although few plants are found on wind blown sand accumulated between the limestone hills, they never grow on the limestone itself. At higher altitude the species also grows on weathered Table Mountain Sandstone. The average annual precipitation along its distribution is 375‚Äì650 mm (15‚Äì25 in), which primarily falls during the winter half year. The plants can survive the wildfires that naturally occurs in the strandveld and fynbos it grows in, by regrowing from the main stem, but only if the fire is not too intense. The white-trailing pincushion is pollinated by rodents which may be attracted by its sweet, yeasty smelling flowers that are great at attracting mice.  Conservation  The white-trailing pincushion is considered to be a species of least concern because of its stable population.

Recorded during a hiatus from The Smithereens, the album features bassist J.J. Burnel, drummer Tony \\"Thunder\\" Smith and saxophonist Sonny Fortune billed as the Pat DiNizio Foursome. The album is produced by Smithereens veteran Don Dixon. Musically, the album is not a major departure from the jangly, Beatlesque power pop that The Smithereens were known for, though on a few songs DiNizio explores jazz, soundtrack and torch song influences. The album opens and closes with two songs from classic films: the melancholy \\"Where I Am Going (Jennie's Song)\\" from Portrait of Jennie (1948) and the jazz-tinged \\"I'd Rather Have the Blues\\" from Kiss Me Deadly (1955).

DiNizio wanted to do something a little different, \\"create a hybrid of musicians who perhaps had no real reason to be in the same room together\\", he explained. DiNizio didn't think that the album was a total departure from his past work, \\"but the approach is completely different than what the Smithereens might have recorded having been given that material\\", he said. \\"I pretty much gave [the musicians] the freedom to do whatever they wanted to do on the record.\\" Lyrically, the album contains songs about the end of DiNizio's marriage; \\"Liza\\" is about the separation from his daughter; and \\"Somewhere Down the Line\\" is about the (temporary) demise of The Smithereens. Also, there are certain declarations of independence, like \\"Running, Jumping, Standing Still\\". DiNizio toured the album with Burnel and Smith as the Pat DiNizio Trio between January and February 1998. Fortune only joined them for the band's New York City date, due to other commitments. Critical reception Mark Caro of the Chicago Tribune rated the album three stars out of four, saying that although DiNizio begins his first solo album by \\"crooning Bernard Herrmann's \\"Where I Am Going\\" over jazz veteran Sonny Fortune's smoky alto-sax leads, he's soon back to delivering compact, crunchy guitar-pop songs not unlike those he writes and sings for the Smithereens\\", adding that DiNizio maintains his \\"devotion to the hook\\". Keith Phipps of The A.V. Club said \\"there are enough modifications and departures on Songs And Sounds to avoid a Smithereens retread, and enough familiar strengths to make it the solidly entertaining album that should be expected of DiNizio\\". AllMusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine rated the album four stars out of five and wrote: \\"DiNizio retains his gift for catchy, effortless melodies, and that ties together the diverse strands of the record\\". He added that the album \\"is the kind of record he couldn't have made with the Smithereens, and that's what makes it such a welcome effort\\". Sam MacDonald of The Daily Press said that while the album contains a few jazzy experiments, \\"Songs and Sounds isn't an enormous departure from The Smithereens' work. It's an uneven effort. But the disc includes some jewels - the Buddy Holly-like \\"A World Apart,\\" the lovely, aching \\"No Love Lost,\\" the quiet, brooding \\"I'd Rather Have The Blues.\\" Michael McCall of the Weekly Wire wrote that the album \\"allows Dinizio to display a newfound artistic breadth. From the soul-baring melancholy of the album's moody opener, \\"Where I Am Going,\\" to the jazz-tinged, cabaret pop of the closing \\"I'd Rather Have the Blues (Than What I've Got),\\" Dinizio proves he's capable of creating distinctly personal songs in a wide variety of musical settings\\".

The genus level classification of New Zealand endemic moths within the genus Aletia is regarded as unsatisfactory and is under revision. It is likely that this species will be removed from the genus Aletia and be placed within one of the following genera: Physetica, Graphania, Tmetolophota or Ichneutica. As such the species is currently also known as Aletia (s.l.) cuneata. The holotype specimen is held at Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa. Description This species was described by Howes as follows: This species was regarded by George Hudson as being very similar to Aletia panda, differing only in having narrower forewings, more oblique termen and smaller orbicular stigma.

After completing his apprenticeship, he associated himself with optical establishments in Karlsruhe, Frankfort, Munich, and Hamburg. Because of his pro-democracy support of the 1848 Revolution, he immigrated to the United States when he was about twenty-two years old. After working for wages in optical workshops in Baltimore and Philadelphia, Zentmayer started in 1858 his own shop in Philadelphia at the corner of Eighth Street and Chestnut Street. During the American Civil War, he provided most of the microscopes used in the U.S. government hospitals. He was appointed a member of the Iowa Total Eclipse Expedition in 1869 and contributed to the success of the expedition by his work on the photographic apparatus.

The mountain is part of the Okanagan Range which is a sub-range of the North Cascades. Whistler Mountain is about two miles west of Washington Pass and one mile east of Rainy Pass. The North Cascades Highway bends around the southern base of the mountain between these two passes. A high ridge connects Whistler to its nearest higher peak, Cutthroat Peak, which is to the north- northeast. Precipitation runoff from the peak drains into Bridge Creek. Climate Whistler Mountain is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach the North Cascades, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range (Orographic lift), causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades. As a result, the west side of the North Cascades experiences high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer.Beckey, p. 16 Because of maritime influence, snow tends to be wet and heavy, resulting in high avalanche danger. Geology The North Cascades features some of the most rugged topography in the Cascade Range with craggy peaks, ridges, and deep glacial valleys. Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to the various climate differences. Whistler Mountain seen from Maple Pass Trail The history of the formation of the Cascade Mountains dates back millions of years ago to the late Eocene Epoch. With the North American Plate overriding the Pacific Plate, episodes of volcanic igneous activity persisted. In addition, small fragments of the oceanic and continental lithosphere called terranes created the North Cascades about 50 million years ago. During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured the landscape leaving deposits of rock debris. The \\"U\\"-shaped cross section of the river valleys are a result of recent glaciation. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the North Cascades area.

The landscape is typified by small mounds, which is what the Arabic term \\"zubar\\" refers to. The \\"east\\" (or sharqiya) portion of its name was given due to it being east of the rawda (depression) from which it derives its name, Umm Al Zubar, and also so that it could be differentiated from a larger village lying to the immediate west called Umm Al Zubar Al Qibliya. Geography It is situated closely to the districts of Al Sailiya and Mebaireek in Al Rayyan Municipality. Infrastrucutre Poor infrastructure is an issue in the village. The electric system is reported to be unreliable and outdated, and there is a lack of sanitation services, facilities and roads. The closest paved road to the village is the Rawdat Rashed Road, which is also known as the \\"road of death\\" due to the high number of accidents that occur on it.

Raymond (May 10, 1914 - May 9, 1999) was an American civil rights leader from Pennsylvania who served as president of the Chester, Pennsylvania branch of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) from 1942 to 1977. He was integral in the desegregation of businesses, public housing and schools in Chester and co-led the Chester school protests in 1964 which made Chester a key battleground in the civil rights movement. Early life and education Raymond was born in Chester, Pennsylvania and graduated from Chester High School in 1933. He studied business administration at Drexel Institute of Technology for one year but economic hardship forced him to leave school and find work. Raymond worked at multiple odd jobs and finally landed at the Chester Boys Club, joined the NAACP and began his career in the civil rights movement. Career Raymond became the leader of the Chester branch of the NAACP in 1942 and began to implement programs to end racial discrimination. He partnered with J. Pius Barbour, the pastor of Calvary Baptist Church in Chester and together they adopted a gradualist approach to civil rights. In 1945, Raymond and the Chester branch of the NAACP successfully desegregated movie theaters, restaurants, hotels and other businesses in Chester through non-violent protests and the threat of legal action. In 1953, the United States Supreme Court rendered its decision in the case Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka declaring state laws establishing separate schools for black and white students to be unconstitutional. The Chester Board of Education technically met the requirements of integration, however Board policy allowed students to request transfers to schools outside their neighborhood. The Board approved most transfers for white students but few for black students. As a result, in 1953, five elementary schools in Chester were almost completely black. However, each of those five schools had white students living within its district that were allowed to attend all- white schools in other parts of town. In 1955, Raymond and the NAACP desegregated public housing run by the Chester Housing Authority. In 1958, Raymond purchased a house in the borough of Rutledge, Pennsylvania in majority white Delaware County. The day before he was to move in, a fire burned down the house. After the fire, the township attempted to exercise eminent domain and claim Raymond's property as a site for a new town hall. Raymond threatened legal action and the township backed down. The house was rebuilt and Raymond took residence in the house in 1959. In 1964, the Chester school protests led to a month long series of almost nightly protests initiated by Stanley Branche and the Committee for Freedom Now against the Chester School Board de facto segregation of schools. The protests were marked by violence and police brutality which caused James Farmer to dub Chester the ‚ÄúBirmingham of the North,‚Äù in reference to the harsh treatment of protesters in Birmingham, Alabama around the same time.. Raymond presented the school board with a list of 10 demands including teacher transfers, transportation of students to schools in other neighborhoods, hiring blacks for supervisory positions and hiring more black secretaries. Over six hundred people were arrested over a two month period of civil rights rallies, marches, pickets, boycotts and sit- ins. Death and legacy George Raymond Gravestone in Haven Memorial Cemetery in Chester, Pennsylvania Raymond died of heart failure on May 9, 1999 and is interred at Haven Memorial Cemetery in Chester. Raymond was presented the Freedom Award by Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall. In 1991, the George T. Raymond award was established in his honor by the NAACP. Three scrapbooks created by Raymond of newspaper clippings, booklets and photographs chronicling the Chester civil rights movement throughout the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s are available online at the Wolfman Digital Collections at Widener University.

Located roughly 30 km away from the capital Doha, it is one of the larger villages in the country, accommodating around 150 Qatari families. Etymology In Arabic, \\"umm\\" is translated to \\"mother\\", and is a common prefix that is attached to a name in order to signify a geographical feature. The landscape is typified by small mounds, which is what the Arabic term \\"zubar\\" refers to. The \\"qibliya\\" (west) portion of its name was given due to it being west of the rawda (depression) from which it derives its name, Umm Al Zubar, and also so that it could be differentiated from a smaller village lying to the immediate east called Umm Al Zubar East. Geography It is situated closely to the districts of Al Sailiya and Mebaireek in Al Rayyan Municipality. The closest sizable city is Rawdat Rashed. Infrastrucutre Poor infrastructure is an issue in the village. The electric system is reported to be unreliable and outdated, and there is a lack of sanitation services, facilities and roads. Streets are narrow and mostly unpaved. The closest paved major road to the village is the Rawdat Rashed Road, which is also known as the \\"road of death\\" due to the high number of accidents that occur on it. This road separates Umm Al Zubar East from its neighbor to the east, Umm Al Zubar East. In 2018, the Public Works Authority announced that it would implement a major project in the village in starting late 2018 which will involve the paving and construction of streets, the rehabilitation of sidewalks, the addition of lighting posts and development of a sewage system. The Public Works Authority had initially approved the design plans for the streets and access road to the village in January 2017.

It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  The Bank of New South Wales was first established in Inverell in 1872. In 1890, the bank wanted new premises which was designed by Varney Parkes on Byron Street at the end of Ortho Street, a prominent position in the town. In 1963, it was converted to council chambers for the Municipality of Inverell and its successor the Inverell Shire Council. The building is now used as retail premises.  Description  The two- storeyed Victorian Italianate rendered brick bank building has a hipped roof (now tiled) and large rendered chimneys. The asymmetrical facade features a small entrance portico near one end with small pediment at roof level supported on Corinthian pilasters; three-bay two-storey verandah under the main roof with arched opening and masonry balustrade; roundheaded doors and French windows, The facade features Corinthian pilasters, dentillated eaves and swag mouldings in the entablature between floors around the entrance portico. The interior retains original stairs, joinery, marble chimney pieces, arches and plaster and pressed metal ceilings. The asymmetrical street fa√ßade reflecting its use as both a manager's residence and bank chamber. The residence has three bay arched and two storied verandahs with Corinthian pilasters and masonry balustrades. The chambers have entrance with windows on each side with pediment at roof level supported with pilasters. The building's ground floor is raised to avoid flooding, and the basement floor opens to the rear. The building has foundations four metres deep and reinforced with railway lines to combat movement on the black soil which is a common problem in Inverell. It has remained structurally sound.  Significance  This building is one of the few Victorian buildings left in the business centre of the town. When built it was a very grand building for Inverell and reflected the mining boom of the 1880s. It occupies the most important streetscape location in the town opposite the end of Otho Street, and contributes significantly to the surviving nineteenth century character of the town centre. It is an outstanding intact Victorian Italianate style bank building and one of the finest and most sophisticated buildings in the Shire. Its presence is enhanced by the raised ground floor level.

It is located on the borders of the Stephen Mather Wilderness and North Cascades National Park. It's situated midway between Black Peak and Easy Pass, adjacent to Repulse Peak. Precipitation runoff from Fisher Peak drains into tributaries of the Skagit River. Climate Fisher Peak is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach the North Cascades, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range (Orographic lift), causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades. As a result, the west side of the North Cascades experiences high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer.Beckey, p. 16 Because of maritime influence, snow tends to be wet and heavy, resulting in high avalanche danger. Geology The North Cascades features some of the most rugged topography in the Cascade Range with craggy peaks, ridges, and deep glacial valleys. Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to the various climate differences. These climate differences lead to vegetation variety defining the ecoregions in this area. The history of the formation of the Cascade Mountains dates back millions of years ago to the late Eocene Epoch. With the North American Plate overriding the Pacific Plate, episodes of volcanic igneous activity persisted. In addition, small fragments of the oceanic and continental lithosphere called terranes created the North Cascades about 50 million years ago. During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured the landscape leaving deposits of rock debris. The \\"U\\"-shaped cross section of the river valleys are a result of recent glaciation. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the North Cascades area.

Specializing in nephrology, she joined the department of medicine, division of renal diseases, at the University of Colorado School of Medicine in 1973, advancing to a full professorship in 1987; she is presently Professor Emerita. She was the principal investigator on the National Institutes of Health Human Polycystic Kidney Disease research grant, which ran from 1985 to 1999, and defined the clinical manifestations and genetics of the disease in adults and children. She served for two decades as CEO of Denver Health, an integrated public healthcare system in Denver, Colorado, where she implemented numerous business-based systems to streamline operations, improve patient care, and recognize cost savings. In particular, her introduction of the \\"Lean\\" quality- improvement system, based on the Toyota Production System, earned her national recognition. She is the author of more than 150 articles and book chapters, three books, and has received numerous awards for excellence in teaching, physician care, and leadership. She was inducted into the Colorado Women's Hall of Fame in 2004. Early life and education Patricia Anne Acquaviva was born in January 1944 to an Italian-American family. Her parents, Pat Acquaviva and Terese Colonna Acquaviva, married in 1942. Her father, a private first class in the US army, was killed in action in March 1945 during the Allied advance from Paris to the Rhine, after which she and her mother moved in with her uncle and grandparents. Her mother, a teacher, remarried to James R. Helmintoller in 1951. She earned her B.S. in biology at Seton Hill College in 1965. She received her M.D. at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania in 1969. Academic career After interning in medicine for one year at the hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, she undertook a one-year residency in internal medicine at Harbor General Hospital in 1970. This was followed by one-year renal fellowships at San Francisco General Hospital and the hospital of the University of Pennsylvania. In 1973 Gabow joined Denver Health and Hospitals to establish its nephrology department. She began as an instructor in the Division of Renal Diseases at the University of Colorado, advancing to a full professorship in 1987. Health administrator Denver Health emergency department Gabow served as Chief of Renal Disease for Denver Health and Hospitals, a city charter department, from 1973 to 1981. In 1976 she was appointed Clinical Director of the department of medicine for Denver Health, also serving in this position until 1981. In 1981 she was appointed Director of Medical Services for Denver Health, serving in this position for a decade. Gabow was named Deputy Manager of Medical Affairs (CMO) for Denver Health in 1989, and was appointed as CEO and Medical Director in 1992. After the creation of an independent state health authority called Denver Health and Hospitals Authority (DHHA) in 1997, Gabow served as CEO and Medical Director of DHHA from 1997 to 2008, and as CEO of DHHA from 2008 to 2012. Under Gabow's leadership, Denver Health introduced several business-based improvement systems to streamline operations, cut excessive spending, and improve employee satisfaction and patient care. Most notable was the \\"Lean\\" quality-improvement system based on the Toyota Production System, introduced in 2005. The Lean management system cuts waste and streamlines processes without restricting access to healthcare by insured patients or necessitating staff layoffs. As one example of the Lean system, Denver Health increased the square footage of its public health facilities by 30 percent, yet it reduced its supply costs by 50 percent. In 2014 Gabow published a book on the use of the Lean system at Denver Health, titled The Lean Prescription: Powerful Medicine for Our Ailing Healthcare System. She and her co-author Philip L. Goodman received the 2015 Shingo Research and Professional Publication Award for the book, while Denver Health itself received the Shingo Bronze Medallion. Other \\"best practices\\" which Gabow adopted from other industries include \\"advice nurse lines\\", new IT systems, and an employee reward program. During Gabow's tenure, Denver Health invested more than $400 million in IT, and recognized cost savings first by transferring 75% of billing to electronic statements and then by going paperless. In 2011, the healthcare system achieved the lowest medical mortality rate among 114 academic medical centers in the University HealthCare Consortium. Gabow retired from Denver Health in September 2012. Research Early in her career, Gabow specialized in nephrology with a focus on polycystic kidney disease.

They were mostly built in the first half of the 20th century by employees of the adjacent Soudan Iron Mine. The mining company provided the lots to employees as a reward for their years of service, and the miners did their own construction. Most of the boathouses were built with tamarack logs and scrap corrugated metal from the mine property. Boating and fishing were major pastimes for the mine employees and their families in their leisure hours, and the mining company promoted access to outdoor recreation as a perk of employment. With The Stuntz Bay Boathouses were listed as a historic district on the National Register of Historic Places in 2007 for their local significance in the themes of architecture, entertainment/recreation, industry, and social history. They were nominated for illustrating the personal lives of the miners and vernacular metal architecture. The Stuntz Bay Boathouses largely remain family-owned inholdings within what is now Soudan Underground Mine State Park. 140 of the boathouses are considered contributing properties to the historic district and three recently rebuilt boathouses are non-contributing. Just inland from the boathouses, the ruins and smokestack of a compressor house built for the mine in 1884 and demolished around 1930 form another contributing property.

Her husband campaigned for her appointment, and in 1981, Sheardown was awarded the first-ever honorary appointment to the Order of Canada.

Jos√© de Meneses e T√°vora Rappach da Silveira e Castro, 2nd Marquis of Valada (13 February 1826 ‚Äì 15 October 1895) was a Portuguese nobleman and politician aligned with the conservative Regenerator Party. Well-regarded as a man of great erudition and a notable parliamentarian, the Marquis of Valada was the protagonist of a well-publicised scandal in 1881, after his homosexuality became a matter of public knowledge. Biography He was the only son, and only child of the second marriage of D. Francisco Xavier de Meneses da Silveira e Castro, 1st Count of Caparica and 1st Marquis of Valada (1754‚Äì1834) to D. Francisca de Almeida Portugal (1792‚Äì1873), the daughter of the 3rd Marquis of Lavradio. From his father's first marriage, he had five half-sisters. By all accounts, Valada was of refined learning and unusual scholarship: he was well-read in the Greek and Latin classics, and frequently cited Homer and Virgil in his parliamentary elocutions; a possessor of a remarkable memory, he was remembered as a veritable repository of political history, both ancient and modern. His father passed away in 1834, and he succeeded him as his heir; the inheritance of the title of Marquis of Valada was confirmed by royal decree on 1 December 1831. The title of Count of Caparica was instead passed on directly to Valada's son, by his request. He was married in Paris, on 19 July 1848, to D. Maria Isabel do Carmo Paula M√°xima Gonzaga de Bragan√ßa, daughter of the 3rd Dukes of Laf√µes. The couple had two children: D. Francisco Xavier de Meneses, 2nd Count of Caparica, and D. Ana Maria Ant√≥nia da Concei√ß√£o de Meneses e T√°vora. Travessa da Espera scandal On the night of 2 August 1881, the police caught the Marquis of Valada in compromising circumstances with a common soldier in Travessa da Espera, a narrow street in Bairro Alto, Lisbon's Upper District. At the time, Valada was serving as deputy Civil Governor of Lisbon. The soldier and the landlady were arrested but Valada, as a member of the aristocracy, managed to escape arrest. Even though homosexuality was not illegal in Portugal at the time, Valada quickly resigned from his post of deputy civil governor. It soon after emerged that Valada had been set up by Ant√≥nio Arrobas, the civil governor, motivated by personal and political internal rivalries. The opposition newspapers got wind of the story; the strength of the reaction was not only due to the social mores of the day, but partly because the incident confirmed pre-existing suspicions. As Civil Governor of Braga It seems that the Marquis of Valada began to regain his political prominence, however; by the summer of 1885, his rehabilitation appeared complete: the government appointed him civil governor of Braga, in northern Portugal. However, he soon became embroiled in political intrigue surrounding local figures involved in clandestine emigration rackets; he issued a gratuitous statement saying that, while the central government remained in power, he would remain as civil governor as long as he wanted to. This was met with by derision by the opposition; the press accused Valada of \\"dragging the authorities through the mud of ridicule\\". The government, led by Fontes Pereira de Melo, further exacerbated the situation by issuing a statement in the Di√°rio do Governo, the official gazette, commending Valada. The row came to such heights that the city of Guimar√£es tried to secede from the Braga District and join the neighbouring Porto District: the situation was viewed with alarm in Lisbon, as it caused considerable local political agitation, and that particular area had been the scene of a violent peasant uprising just forty years prior. Even though the secessionist movement was thwarted and Valada was ultimately forced to resign, the dispute has been cited as the cause of the fall of the Regenerator-led government some weeks later.

In early medicine and anatomy, the location of the soul was hypothesized to be physically located within the body. Aristotle and Plato understood the soul as a corporeal form but closely related to the physical world. The Hippocratic Corpus chronicles the evolution of thought that the soul is located within the body and is manifested in diseased conditions. Later, Galen explicitly used Plato's description of the corporeal soul to physical locations in the body. The logical (ŒªŒøŒ≥ŒπœÉœÑŒπŒ∫œåœÇ) in the brain, the spirited (Œ∏œÖŒºŒøŒµŒπŒ¥Œ≠œÇ) in the heart, and the appetitive (·ºêœÄŒπŒ∏œÖŒºŒ∑œÑŒπŒ∫œåŒΩ) in the liver. Today neuroscientists and other fields of science that deal with the body and the mind, such as psychology, bridge the gap between what is physical and what is corporeal.  Ancient Egypt  The earliest theory pertaining to the location of the soul is thought to come from Ancient Egypt during the third millennium BC. Ancient Egyptian civilizations held the belief that the soul was composed of several parts: the Ba, Ka, Ren, Sheut, and the Ib. Furthermore, the Ib was located in the heart, and considered the vital force that brought human beings to life. Because the Ib was also responsible for thoughts and feelings, its status determined a person's fate upon their death. This took place during a heart weighing ceremony, in which Anubis would feed the heaviest hearts to the demon Ammit. It is believed that the Ancient Egyptian view of the heart formed the foundation for later theories on the location for the human soul.  Hippocratic Corpus  The Hippocratic Corpus and its many treatises demonstrate the evolving knowledge of the body and how to treat ailments in reference to the soul. The treatise on Diseases II physicians are warned about the illnesses associated with air in the body, particularly in the lungs causing the patient to cough vigorously and hoarsely. > \\"Œ¥ŒπŒ±œÄŒΩŒµŒπŒΩ Œ¥ŒøŒöŒµŒπ Œ¥ŒπŒ± œÉœÑŒ∑Œ∏ŒµŒøŒ∂\\" translated as \\"the patient is breathing through their lungs\\". The next lines detail that this is an extremely serious time condition for the patient and was a cause of great concern. To remedy the air in the lungs the physician was advised to clear out the lungs of all air that was possible using a bladder and hosing. Later in the Corpus, during or after the life of Aristotle on Disease IV, pneuma, or air is presented as a warming life force. In the treatise On the Sacred Disease air is described as not being located in just the lungs but in the entire body and circulating it giving life. According to the treatise the first location of the air is to the brain and it describes that medical conditions of the brain can be caused by a blockage of air flow there. Aristotle in his works refers to pneuma being directly related to the soul.  Plato  Plato, the student of Socrates and teacher to Aristotle, suggests in Timmeus that the human soul was divine in nature, and that it entered the human body after separating from a spiritual origin that it would return to upon death. Furthermore, Plato believed the soul to be a tripartite one, composed of the logos, the thymos, and the epithemitikon. In order to protect the immortal soul from contamination, the perishable souls, the thymos and the epithemitikon, were separated from the head by the neck. The thymos, responsible for feelings such as rage, bravery, and hope, was located in the chest cavity. The epithemitikon, which controlled desires and unconscious thought, was located near the umbilicus, farthest from the logos. The brain, then, was the seat of all rational thought, the logos, and the true location of the immortal and divine soul.  Aristotle  Aristotle in De Anima (On the Soul) suggests that organs of the body are required for the soul to interact with. Unlike Plato, Aristotle believed the soul's existence was not separate from the human body, thus the soul could not be immortal. Similarly to Plato, however, Aristotle believed the soul is composed of three parts: the vegetative, sensitive, and rational. Growth and reproduction is a result of the vegetative soul, and is found in all organisms. The sensitive soul, however, allows for sensation and movement in humans and animals. The third, the rational, is exclusive to humans, and allows for rational thought. In book II, Aristotle states that, the soul is the part of the human that allows its entire being, that one can't exist without the other and they complement each other. In book III he provides an example of his theory of the soul and makes the correlation between the physical sensations of light the phaos in the body and the corporeal imaginations phantasia. Aristotle imagined the soul as in part, within the human body and in part a corporeal imagination. In Aristotle's treatise On Youth, Old Age, Life and Death, and Respiration, Aristotle explicitly states that while the soul has a corporeal form, there is a physical area of the soul in the human body, the heart. Aristotle states the heart is the location of the 5 sensations of the body and is directly responsible for respiration and the sustenance of life. The heart is of further importance as it is all animal's area of heating the body and blood and the creation of pneuma, or life force that animates the body. To Aristotle this explains why dead things become cold, do not breathe, and that their souls have left them. Because the heart is the location of the human soul and life force, it is the organ of utmost importance in Aristotelian physiology. Correspondingly, the heart is the first organ to appear during embryonic development.  Epicurus  Epicurus, with a view reflecting that of the Greek philosopher Democritus, suggested that the human soul was corporeal and composed of small particles spread out within the entire body. Epicurus believed that the separation of these small particles resulted in a loss of sensation, and consequently, death. Like Aristotle, Epicurus was of the opinion that the soul was a result of the body, making it mortal and perishable.  Herophilus  Image depicting the third and fourth ventricle‚ÄìHerophilus thought as these were the seat of the soul. In the third century Herophilos in Alexandria was one of the first anatomists to perform dissections of the human body for the brief time that it was legal. Herophilos discovered many novel aspects of the human body, specifically in the brain and associated tissues. The works of Herophilus were lost in the fire of Alexandria of 391 AD and therefore we only know of his existence in other surviving works. Most of the medical terminology and works are recorded in the books by Galen and therefore the reliability that Herophilus actually thought to the soul to be in the body is in question. According to the recordings of his work, Herophilus thought that the location of the soul is in the brain, specifically in the ventricles of the brain, the 4 open cavities in the innermost parts of the brain. Herophilos describes the distinction of the soul and natures as being intertwined within the body and while are separate things, cannot exist without the other. Herophilos in his dissections discovered the differences between nerves and blood vessels. Nerves carried the pneuma or soul to animate the body and the vessels being related to nature. Following the lines tracks of the nerves through the body he saw that they all converge in the brain, and by Herophilus' reasoning the ventricles of the brain. Of particular importance to the location of the soul was the 4th ventricle of the brain. Herophilus observed that there existed two types of nerves, those that functioned in motor activity and those that take in sensory information. Because all nerves are a continuation of the spinal cord and the cerebellum, which are located most closely to the 4th ventricle, it stood to reason that the center of movement and perception, and thus the soul, must be located in the 4th ventricle. In his treatise, On Anatomy, pneuma was inhaled by the lungs and sent to the brain ventricles via the vessels of the body where the brain would convert it into what he called \\"psychic pneuma\\", or the soul, and produce thought, motion and all other animations of the body. Herophilus discovered the bumpy aspect of the walls of the ventricles of the brain that he called the choroid plexus and which was thought to be the interaction of the brain with the pneuma to create the psychic pneuma and then these were sent out via the nervous system. He further identified 8 of the cerebral nerves and tracked them to the spinal cord and throughout the body. The choroid plexus is the term still used today and are the structures that produce cerebrospinal fluid.  Galen  Galen was one of the most foundational physicians in history and is known for careful and detailed vivisection and dissections of animals that was foundational to modern medicine. Galen was known for his treatises on being both a physician and a philosopher and was well versed in the works of Plato. His medical anatomy is described through the use of Plato's corporeal ideals of the soul. The heart was the spirited, the liver the appetitive, and the brain the logical. Galen states in On Respiration and the Arteries \\"one must determine by dissection that the number and nature of the structures that connect the heart to the brain\\" and it was observed that when these nerves were cut in animals they would lose their voice and when veins were cut they would bleed, but retain their voice. Therefore, the brain does not need the heart to feel or create sensations and the heart does not need the brain to move. Galen recognized the importance of both the heart and the brain in the proper functioning of a human but saw these as two distinct systems governed separately. Therefore, there are two souls in combat, the brain representing the logical soul and driving logical being, the heart representing spirited actions of movement and impulse constantly at odds with each other and supplied by different supporting systems. Galen states the \\"liver is the archai\\" or the source of the veins and blood of the body and is therefore important in regards to the appetitive soul, but does little to elaborate further on the reason for its connection on why this makes it appetitive. He continues to theorize that the \\"spleen purifies the liver\\" but does not while the spleen does not purify the liver it highlight the anatomical connections of the human body. Galen addresses that the proof for the liver is not as obvious as it was in the case of the heart and the brain.  Plotinus  The Egyptian philosopher and father of Neo-Platonism, Plotinus‚Äôs idea of the human soul would form the foundation for the Christian view of the human soul. Like Plato, Plotinus believed that the soul resulted from an immortal being that would return to its divine source upon death. Plotinus believed in two parts of the soul, a higher level rational part and the lower level portion located in the entire body.  Thomas Aquinas  Thomas Aquinas sought a Christian view of the soul using the ideas of Aristotle. In Aquinas‚Äôs view, the soul was incorporeal and immortal, and came about as a direct result of divine intervention from God, which typically came about during the second trimester of pregnancy. At this point, the fetus would have the ability to perceive and move, the result of being given a soul.  Leonardo da Vinci  Leonardo da Vinci used his experience in the field of anatomy to hypothesize that the soul was located in the optic chiasm, near the 3rd ventricle of the brain. His views were supported by observations of change in perception following disturbances to that particular area of the brain.  Ren√© Descartes  Descartes accepted Plotinus‚Äôs perspective on the dual nature of the soul. According to Descartes, the soul conferred the ability to think; this differentiated humans from animals, who had no ability to think or even feel. However, Descartes believed that the physical body and the mind must be physically connected at some point. Descartes‚Äô reasoning came from his observation that every structure of the brain is paired except for the pineal gland. He felt that the pineal gland must be the meeting point of the physical body and the mind, and therefore, the pineal gland must be the location of the soul.

She wrote in modern Greek. She spent most of her exile from 1947 to 1964, in the German Democratic Republic. Life and work The daughter of musician and composer Georgios Axiotis, she was raised on the Greek island of Mykonos without a mother. From 1918 to 1922 she attended the school of the Ursulines on the island of Tinos. After a short marriage with her theology professor Vassilis Markaris she went to Athens in 1930, where she soon debuted with short stories in the magazine Mykoniatika Chronika. She was one of the pioneers of Greek surrealism. In 1937 her first novel Heavy Nights was published and she received in 1939 the 1st Prize of the Women's Association of Letters and Arts. In the meantime she had become a member of the Communist Party of Greece. During the Axis occupation of Greece she participated in the underground work of the communist-controlled National Liberation Front. With the persecution of communists during the Greek Civil War, in 1947 she went to exile in France, where she became acquainted with the likes of Louis Aragon, Pablo Neruda and Pablo Picasso. Expelled in 1950, she found admission in the GDR, interrupted only by short stay in Warsaw. While teaching Modern Greek and History of Modern Greek Literature at the Humboldt University of Berlin, several books of Axioti were translated and published by GDR publishers. Her much-read novel about the 20th century (from 1946) deals with the uncompromising and correspondingly loss-resisting resistance of Greek women to fascism (and the German Wehrmacht). The poetry collection Kontrabandp (1959) leads to friendship and cooperation with Yiannis Ritsos. In 1964 Axioti receives an official entry permit to return to her homeland.

It is located two miles southwest of Rainy Pass on the borders of the Stephen Mather Wilderness and North Cascades National Park. The mountain derives its name from a mining claim on the south side (Bridge Creek side) that was worked in the 1920s. Its nearest higher peak is Rainy Peak, to the east-southeast. Precipitation runoff from Frisco Mountain drains into Rainy Lake and tributaries of Bridge Creek. The retreating Lyall Glacier in its northeast cirque contributes to waterfalls which tumble into Rainy Lake. Climate Frisco Mountain is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach the North Cascades, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range (Orographic lift), causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades. As a result, the west side of the North Cascades experiences high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer.Beckey, p. 16 Because of maritime influence, snow tends to be wet and heavy, resulting in high avalanche danger. Geology The North Cascades feature some of the most rugged topography in the Cascade Range with craggy peaks and ridges and deep glacial valleys. Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to the various climate differences. The history of the formation of the Cascade Mountains dates back millions of years ago to the late Eocene Epoch. With the North American Plate overriding the Pacific Plate, episodes of volcanic igneous activity persisted. In addition, small fragments of the oceanic and continental lithosphere called terranes created the North Cascades about 50 million years ago. During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured the landscape leaving deposits of rock debris. The \\"U\\"-shaped cross section of the river valleys are a result of recent glaciation. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the North Cascades area.

The closest major city is the municipal seat, Al-Shahaniya City. Historically, the village has been inhabited primarily by members of the Dawasir tribe. Etymology According to the Ministry of Municipality and Environment, \\"khurayb\\" is derived from the Arabic word \\"kharab\\", which translates to \\"damage\\". This name was given to the area because during the wet season, fast-flowing water would engulf the area, causing harm to the local vegetation. History J.G. Lorimer makes mention of Al Khurayb in his 1908 handbook, the Gazetteer of the Persian Gulf. He listed its location as 19 miles south-west of Khor Shaqiq and 16 miles east from the east coast. Remarking on the nature of the settlement, he describes at as a Bedouin camping ground where good water is obtainable at 15 fathoms from a masonry well. This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the public domain. Geography Al Khurayb is close to the municipal seat of Al-Shahaniya City, 7 km to the south. It is situated 40 km away from the capital Doha. Al Dossari Zoo & Game Reserve After oil was first struck on the western Dukhan anticline in 1939, two deep wells were bored close to Al Khurayb in 1953, so as to examine the oil-producing capability at the peak of the Qatar anticline, which Al Khurayb and the majority of Qatar lies on. The outcomes were less than desirable, prompting prospectors to continue their investigations further north. The Al Dossari Zoo & Game Reserve, a private park founded in 1980, is based in Al Khurayb. More than three-hundred animals can be found in the park which spans at least 100,000 square meters. It is a popular destination for families. Facilities include residential buildings and a heritage center. The Qatar Tourism Authority has been active in developing the site as a tourist destination. Infrastructure Basic utilities such as water and electricity are sub-par. Waste removal is also a problem in the village, as debris often obstructs its streets. Few shops are located nearby. The village hosts the largest sheep complex in Qatar, and in recent years the government established a feed storage warehouse. There is not yet a veterinary clinic in the complex.

She has a Master's degree in Architecture from the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul and has worked with illustration since 1993, mainly with publishers of the Franco-Belgian comics market. Her first work was for European publisher √âditions Daniel Maghen in 2009, being responsible for the art of the two volumes of the graphic novel Awrah, written by Fuat Erkol and Christian Simon. Koehler has also worked for publishers such as Soleil Productions, Fauvard and DC Comics, among others, as well as creating scientific illustrations of Archeology and History. In 2015, Koehler became curator of Festival Internacional de Quadrinhos, the most traditional comics festival in Brazil. In the same year, she published in Brazil the independent graphic novel Beco do Ros√°rio, which talks about the modernization of Porto Alegre in the 1920s and tells the fictional story of Vit√≥ria, a young girl who lives in the area of Beco do Ros√°rio and who dreams to become a journalist. The drawings were made with dip pen and watercolor. The work was developed in parallel to Koehler's Master dissertation, whose theme was the urban changes of the region of Beco do Ros√°rio. In 2016, Koehler won the Trof√©u HQ Mix, the most important Brazilian comic book award, in the category \\"best independent author publication\\" by her graphic novel Beco do Rosario.

The purpose of the Mississippi Health Project was to bring health awareness to Mississippi Delta residents who did not have access to health care. The initiative lasted for six years, until World War II. Mobile clinics were set up underneath trees. Surgeon General Thomas Parran called the project \\"one of the greatest efforts of volunteer public health\\" he had ever seen. Background At the beginning of the twentieth century, the Deep South was a place riddled with inequality. Jim Crow was the way of life around the South. Many Southern African Americans worked in low-paying jobs, such as maids, laborers, and farm hands (sharecroppers) in \\"separate but equal\\" facilities. At the time, African- Americans did not have access to medical care or clinics. During the time of the project, Mississippi's Health Department did not treat African Americans due to segregation of facilities. Often, African Americans had to walk miles for health care, which was generally substandard. The socioeconomic lifestyle for African Americans were also poor at the time, since African-Americans did not have the same opportunities as Caucasian Americans. Beginnings Dororthy Ferebee served as medical director for the Mississippi Health Project. Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority saw the need to bring the attention of Mississippi Delta to African-American families who \\"were on the brink of social and economic disaster\\" due to the Great Depression.The Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority Health Project. Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Incorporated. 1938. PDF. Accessed on July 14, 2018. Ninth International President Ida L. Jackson founded the project as part of her administration.McNealey, E., Pearls of Service, p. 179. The project would treat poor, rural African-American Mississippians with primary medical care. Jackson had acquired $1,000 from the Boul√© to fund the project in December 1935.McNealey, E., Pearls of Service, p. 181. Dorothy Celeste Boulding Ferebee, a physician and Alpha Kappa Alpha's tenth International President, served as the first medical director for the Mississippi Health Project; the \\"seven year program stands as one the most impressive examples of voluntary public health work ever conducted by black physicians in the Jim Crow South, touching thousands of black Mississippians at a time when they had virtually no access to professional medical care.\\" The sorority provided the materials to assist the medical patients. From 1935 to 1942, the Mississippi Health Project was active for about two to six weeks in the summer. Mobile medical units in poverty-stricken areas were sent to rural African-American populations. The project was endorsed by U.S. Senator Byron Patton Harrison and Mississippi's Department of Health. The United States Public Health Service also was involved. At the peak of the project, it aided nearly 15,000 children and families. Alpha Kappa Alpha members drew federal attention to the needs of African Americans in the rural South. Project participants had smallpox and diphtheria immunization programs in African- American sharecropper communities. With the assistance of physicians, venereal disease, syphilis, and malaria were treated. Health and food workshops were given by the sorority to bring attention to the region's high malnutrition rate. Legacy Seated: Yvonne T. Maddox, NICHD Deputy Director; Linda White, Worldwide Head of AKA; and Juanita Doty, AKA Program Chair. Standing: Representatives from NIH Institutes and Jackson, Mississippi. The United States Supreme Court's unanimous ruling in Brown v. Board of Education (1954) outlawed segregation of public facilities. This ruling lead to improved access to healthcare for African-Americans in the South after the Civil Rights Movement in the 1950s and 1960s. During the late 1990s, U.S. Senator Thad Cochran (R-MS), along with a group of Jackson residents, converted a former retail mall into a major medical facility in the region. The Jackson Medical Mall is now home to clinics and offices belonging to the University of Mississippi Medical Center (UMMC), in addition to Jackson State University and Tougaloo College educational facilities. Also based out of the mall is the Jackson Heart Study, which is supported by both the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute and the National Center for Minority Health and Health Disparities. In 2006, Alpha Kappa Alpha paired with the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in celebrating the seventy-first anniversary of the Mississippi Health Project. International President Linda White commented on the necessity to bring attention to the healthcare in the area: \\"Our members began working with the NIH in a campaign to reduce the risks of sudden infant death syndrome among African-American infants. We are happy to expand our relationship to make a real impact on reducing health disparities.\\" Books cited * References Category:Alpha Kappa Alpha Category:Public health organizations Category:Health education in the United States Category:Health in Mississippi Category:Race and health in the United States ","title":"Mississippi Health Project"},{"id":"57904630","text":"The Euskadi Ta Askatasuna (ETA) Separatist organisation committed several attacks on Spanish consulates and businesses in the Netherlands in 1989 and 1990.

Irving Chair in Sustainable Development from 1993 onward. In 2003, he was awarded professor emeritus status by the Universit√© de Moncton. LaPierre served on many environmental review panels, held major positions at many Canadian environmental organizations, and developed strategies for protecting natural areas throughout New Brunswick. He served as an environmental advisor to J. D. Irving, and promoted a \\"scientific approach\\" to resolving New Brunswick's hydraulic fracturing controversy, rejecting calls for a moratorium and promoting increased shale gas exploration. In 2013, he was appointed Chair of the newly created New Brunswick Energy Institute, which was tasked with researching hydraulic fracturing in the province. Although he published very few peer-reviewed academic papers, LaPierre received numerous awards and accolades throughout his career, including a Lifetime Achievement Award and an Eco-citizenship Award from Environment Canada, and a 125th Anniversary of the Confederation of Canada Medal. In 2001, he received an honorary doctorate from Universit√© Sainte-Anne. In 2012, he was made a member of the Order of Canada. On September 4, 2013, Radio-Canada reported that LaPierre had been misrepresenting his academic credentials. Specifically, LaPierre falsely claimed that he had an M.Sc. and a Ph.D. in Ecology from the University of Maine, whereas he had actually received a master's degree in Science Education from the University of Maine and a Ph.D. in Education from Walden University. Shortly thereafter, LaPierre apologized and resigned from his academic and non-academic appointments and was stripped of his professor emeritus status. In May 2014, LaPierre resigned from the Order of Canada, becoming one of only a small number of people to have done so.

The book is one of many books on the same subject attributed to the author, such as ShaqƒÅ æiq al-utrunj fƒ´ raqƒÅ æiq al-ghunj.  Subject  Most of the chapters of the book deal with sex education as showing various sex positions and giving advice that told by whom were considered as experts on these subjects. The other chapters contain poetry (usually happens to be short) and urban tales, mostly using explicit and vulgar words and some are attributed to well-known figures such as Abu Nuwas, Ibn al-Rumi, Al-Asma øi and Al-·π¢afadƒ´. Some old Arab scholars classified these kind of books as 'Ilm al-Bah (The Art of Coition). The book also has some chapters relating tales about homosexuals and eunuchs, but in most occasions the author tries to depict the mainstream preferences of adult men at the time.  Author controversy  Regarding the sensitive and explicit subjects mentioned in the book, some modern Islamic scholars condemn and believe it is impossible to accredit the manuscript to Al-Suyuti, who is considered one of the most important figures in the literature of Sunni Islam.

It is located one mile northwest of Easy Pass on the borders of the Stephen Mather Wilderness and North Cascades National Park. The mountain's name \\"Kitling\\" derives from Chinook Jargon \\"ketling\\" which means kettle.http://www.washington.edu/uwired/outreach/cspn/Website/Classroom%20Materials/Curriculum%20Packets/Treaties%20&%20Reservations/Documents/Chinook_Dictionary_Abridged.pdf The mountain takes its name from Kitling Lake which is one mile north of the peak. The name was officially adopted in 1969 by the U.S. Board on Geographic Names. Kitling Peak is situated at the east end of Ragged Ridge. Other peaks on Ragged Ridge include Mesahchie Peak, Kimtah Peak, Katsuk Peak, and Graybeard Peak. The nearest higher peak is Mesahchie Peak, to the south. The Mesahchie Glacier on Kitling's northwest slope forms the headwaters of Panther Creek. Precipitation runoff on the east side of the mountain drains into Ross Lake via Granite Creek, whereas the west side of the peak drains into Diablo Lake via Panther Creek and Fisher Creek. Climate Kitling Peak is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach the North Cascades, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range (Orographic lift), causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades. As a result, the west side of the North Cascades experiences high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer. Because of maritime influence, snow tends to be wet and heavy, resulting in high avalanche danger. Geology The North Cascades features some of the most rugged topography in the Cascade Range with craggy peaks, spires, ridges, and deep glacial valleys. Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to the various climate differences. The history of the formation of the Cascade Mountains dates back millions of years ago to the late Eocene Epoch. With the North American Plate overriding the Pacific Plate, episodes of volcanic igneous activity persisted. In addition, small fragments of the oceanic and continental lithosphere called terranes created the North Cascades about 50 million years ago. During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured the landscape leaving deposits of rock debris. The \\"U\\"-shaped cross section of the river valleys are a result of recent glaciation. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the North Cascades area.

They issued two studio albums, Explore (1991) and Handlelight (1993). In December 1993 Welsh was replaced on guitar by James Lomas with Monique Boggia added on keyboards before the group disbanded in March 1994.  History  Have a Nice Day (often given as the initialism, HAND) were formed in 1989 in Melbourne by Glenn Lewis on lead guitar, Fiona Lee Maynard on lead vocals and bass guitar, and her younger brother, Glenn Maynard on drums. According to Australian musicologist, Ian McFarlane, they were \\"essentially a power pop outfit with a metallic edge... Fronted by the confident and talented Fiona Lee Maynard.\\" The group's influences, \\"ranged from Cheap Trick, Kiss and The Ramones to Suzi Quatro and The Buzzcocks.\\" Marc Welsh replaced Lewis on lead guitar in 1990 and the group supported local gigs by international artists, Mudhoney, Concrete Blonde, Faith no More and Suzi Quatro. They released their debut single, \\"Fill Me Up\\", in August 1990. The lead track was written by Fiona Lee, while its B-side, \\"Jannifer\\", was written by Welsh. Note: For additional work user may have to select 'Search again' and then 'Enter a title:' &/or 'Performer:' Fiona Lee and Welsh became domestic partners. A six-track, self- titled extended play followed via Shock Records, late in that year, with Paul Tagg producing. McFarlane observed that it was, \\"full of energetic and passionate pop.\\" The group's debut studio album, Explore, was issued in September 1991 with Kevin Shirley producing, engineering and mixing. Woronis reviewer rated it at four-and-a-half stars out of five and explained, \\"[its] a top debut album, full of loud crunching guitars, sliding vocal (dis)harmonies and killer song writing... The sound is a melting pot for a large variety of styles ‚Äì punk, indie, metal on the hard edge and pop, caressing the listener before the loud bits come back to throw you back in your seat.\\" Whereas McFarlane felt, \\"[it] mixed melodic power pop ('Comfort and Solitude', 'These Are Memories', the single 'Get to Know You') with crunching heavy rock ('Lady of the Lake').\\" They released a three-track EP, Slipped Away, in March 1992. In April of the following year they supported a tour by United States group, Extreme. Have a Nice Day issued two singles, \\"All of Me\\" (May 1993) and \\"You Understand\\" (September); and followed with their second album, Handlelight, in October. It was produced, engineered and mixed by Mark Deamley. McFarlane stated that it provided, \\"a mellower sound overall, with ballads like 'Not Crying Anymore' being the most effective tracks.\\" In December Welsh was replaced on guitar by James Lomas with Monique Boggia added on keyboards. The group played their final shows in March 1994.  Afterwards  Fiona Lee Maynard started her solo career with her version of \\"Not Crying Anymore\\", as a single in August 1994 and followed with a reworked version of Handlelight issued as My Time in November. Fiona Lee and Lomas became domestic partners and later married. In 1995 the pair formed another group, In Vivo, which included members of Concrete Blonde. They released a self-titled album in January 1996, which was produced by Johnette Napolitano (of Concrete Blonde). The group toured Australia in 1997 and again in 1998. In that year, Fiona Lee and Lomas with Kris Harris on drums for In Vivo added Dave Thomas on guitar. They recorded an EP, Scary (June 1999) with Boggia on keyboards. Glenn Maynard had joined Violetine, and in mid-1997 he moved into alternate rockers, Pollyanna, on drums during recording of that group's second album, Hello Halo (late 1997).

The collective title is the title of the collection, it must be mentioned on each book. The books that make up an editorial collection can be published in a specific order or not. When each volume in the collection has a serial number, it is called a numbered collection. A collection generally using distinctive, common formats and features. The title of a collection can be accompanied by the term \\"series\\" or its equivalents in other languages, such as in the English-speaking world, for example, the , and are all termed book series instead of collections.  Brief history  The Spanish publisher 's bookshop in 19th-century Madrid. In France, the concept \\"collection\\" invented by Louis Hachette, a 19th-century publisher, under the name , which means \\"library\\". In 19th and early 20th-century Spain, literary collections such as ', ', ' and ' were produced. Another collection created in 1851, in Madrid, the ', notably for its encyclopaedialike contents. It contains not only the literary works (popular novels of the 19th century), but also reference work (dictionary), Comte de Buffon's , Cesare Cant√π's , Juan de Mariana's ... and it even contains the whole Bible in Spanish (). In Italy, the first editorial collection is , which included the vulgarised works of twelve Greek historians, edited by the 16th-century humanist Tommaso Porcacchi and printed in Venice by Gabriele Giolito de' Ferrari from 1563 to 1585. They gave it this metaphorical use of the term: each work is a \\"ring\\" or \\"joy\\" of the ( originally means \\"necklace\\").  Definition  A collection is characterized by having uniformity in the presentation, as well as by a certain affinity in the contents. For each book the same dimensions are used, the same type of cover, and also the same type of spine. In this regard, sometimes the same colours are used on the cover (in the case of the publishing houses Dalloz and ), and sometimes different colours or details are always systematically used (collection of the √âditions du ). Generally, the grammage of the paper for each collection is always the same, as well as the typography applied, the cover design and page layout (collection ). Certain collections even get to fix the number of pages, for example, the books in the collection always have 128 pages. A collection can be further subdivided into several series or sub-collections, for example, the collection contains seven series as well as several sub-collections. The volumes of the same collection are also characterized by a defined content or style. Thus, a literary collection will have, for example, novels in their original language, translated works, works with literary value of national authors, or regroup texts of a certain subject or a certain genre, et cetera. In terms of documentary works, there are collections of school or university textbooks, collections of research works and collections of practical books. Some collections are distinguished by a very strong orientation towards specialisation, such as collection on the study of Egyptology, collection on jurisprudence, on pharmacy, astronomy... others inversely by an encyclopaedic tendency (in the case of ). Some collections include both literary texts and documentary texts, such as , others are specialised in the classic books. Undoubtedly, a publication in a collection format has its importance in terms of marketing. Given that a collection is characterized by a visual unity, with successive editions and with the help of propaganda, it can even lead to a degree of fidelity of the public, which obviously supports the commercial success of the collection.

The homemade bomb was hidden in a locker at √òstbanehallen and the explosion caused extensive damage to the station. A young woman, Elin Stoltenberg Dahl, was killed. Eight days after the attack, another bomb was found in the station's ticket hall, which had 2 kg more explosives. It failed to detonate. An unnamed 18-year-old youngster from Nordstrand was arrested a month later after a shotgun was fired. His fingerprints matched that with the station bombing case, and he later admitted carrying out the attack. His motive for the bombing was self- extortion and wanted to push the Norwegian State Railways (NSB) for money. He was also convicted of 30 other criminal offences, including theft, vandalism, and arms shootings, and also planned to bomb a train track at Ekeberg. He was jailed for eleven years.

It was the first 12 July parade to take place in Derry for five years. Violence broke out in the republican Bogside area in what has been called the worst in the city in \\"decades\\". The Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) has blamed the New IRA group for trying to kill police officers. Riot police fired plastic baton rounds, whilst at least 70 petrol bombs have been thrown at them. The riots have been condemned by senior leaders, including Sinn F√©in leader Mary Lou McDonald who attended a \\"not in my name\\" rally. An Ulster Unionist Party MLA has claimed that the republican rioters are \\"using children\\" to blame the PSNI for the violence. Violence linked to the riots overspilled in other parts of Northern Ireland. On 13 July, the house of Gerry Adams in west Belfast was attacked with a home-made bomb. Adams survived injury and claimed that his two grandchildren were standing at the doorway only ten minutes before the blast at 10:50 pm. The house of another republican in Belfast, Bobby Storey, was also attacked the same day. However, no casualties were reported in either of the attacks. On 20 July, the New IRA claimed responsibility for gun and bomb attacks at police during the disturbances in Derry.

The group supports the East Turkestan independence movement. Salih Hudayar, an Uyghur American consultant and graduate student founded the group after pre- existing Uyghur organizations failed to effectively call for East Turkestan's independence deeming it \\"controversial\\".  Advocacy  According to ETNAM, it seeks to establish unity, democratic values and compassion amongst the people of East Turkistan (known as \\"Xinjiang\\" by China) in order to restore the state of East Turkestan in accordance with international laws. It strives to promote the national interest and rights of all the peoples of East Turkistan (\\"Xinjiang\\"). ETNAM strongly believes that the East Turkestan National Movement is not exclusive to the Uyghurs but all Turkic peoples of East Turkistan including Kazakhs, Kyrgyz, Uzbeks, Tatars, and others. The group advocates for \\"the end of China's colonization and occupation of East Turkistan and actively strives to restore the independence of East Turkestan.\\" ETNAM is the first Uyghur organization to not portray the Uyghur and other Turkic peoples of East Turkistan as a persecuted minority, but rather as an occupied state. Activities Since its founding, ETNAM has organized numerous demonstrations calling for the independence of East Turkestan and lobbied members of the US Congress to enact bills to help protect the Uyghur and other Turkic peoples of East Turkistan (\\"Xinjiang\\"). On December 20, 2018, in remembrance of the 69th anniversary of China's occupation of East Turkistan, the group organized a march from the White House to the State Department and called on the US government to \\"recognize the genocide occurring in East Turkistan\\" and also called on the United Nations to \\"act according to the UN Genocide Convention and stop the 21st century Holocaust\\". The movement's founder Salih Hudayar gave a speech calling on support for restoring East Turkestan's independence at a Committee on the Present Danger: China event on April 9, 2019. On July 15, 2019, Bill Gertz, the editor for The Washington Free Beacon reported that researchers with the East Turkistan National Awakening Movement, a relatively new Uyghur independence group, discovered the new camps during a nine-month open-source intelligence gathering project that utilized commercial satellite images and reports people in the region. They identified at least 124 internment camps, 193 prisons, and 66 bingtuan labor camps along with 37 military facilities in East Turkistan (\\"Xinjiang\\"). The group was also the only Uyghur group to sign onto an open letter authored by retired U.S. Navy Captain James E. Fanell, the former director of intelligence and information operations for the U.S. Pacific Fleet, urging President Donald Trump to \\"stay the course\\" and continue his policy of being tough on China. The letter was rebutting a previous letter titled \\"China is Not the Enemy\\" written in the Washington Post which urged President Donald Trump to cooperate with China. On October 1, 2019, the 70th Anniversary of the People's Republic of China, ETNAM's founder, Salih Hudayar, joined dozens of Uyghurs, Tibetans, Hong Kongers, Mongolians, and Kazakhs in front of the United Nations in New York City, where he called on the United Nations to recognize China's atrocities against Uyghurs, Tibetans, and others as a genocide and to recognize East Turkistan, Tibet, and South Mongolia as Occupied Territories. On October 11, 2019, ETNAM participated in a joint rally for Hong Kong hosted by the College Democrats and the College Republicans of the Catholic University of America where Salih Hudayar joined former former Senior Director for Strategic Planning at the White House, Brigadier General Robert Spalding in calling for support for Hong Kong. On November 12, 2019, the 86th & 75th Anniversary of the East Turkistan Republics, ETNAM held a press conference where they released the coordinates of 182 suspected concentration camps, along with producing a map of East Turkistan containing 209 points labeled prisons, and 74 points labeled labor camps. ETNAM stated it would release further coordinates of prisons and labor camps in coming weeks. After the press conference, ETNAM also held a joint demonstration with the East Turkistan Government-in-Exile in front of the US Capitol, where they called on the US Congress to pass the Uyghur Human Rights Policy Act and to recognize East Turkistan as an Occupied Territory. ETNAM has made the satellite imagery data publicly available on their website. China's Foreign Ministry issued a statement calling ETNAM a \\"terrorist organization\\" but later corrected its statement, however Chinese diplomat Lijian Zhao refused to delete his tweet and continued to refer to ETNAM as an \\"ETIM organization\\", a reference to the militant East Turkestan Islamic Movement (now the Turkistan Islamic Party). In late February, ETNAM called on the international community to turn their attention to the plight of the Uyghurs and other Turkic peoples in East Turkistan amidst the coronavirus pandemic. Starting in early March, ETNAM's Founder Salih Hudayar, who also is the recently elected Prime Minister of the East Turkistan Government-in-Exile spoke to numerous journalists and media outlets about China's forced transfer of Uyghur and other Turkic peoples to Chinese provinces for forced labor which he described as \\"slave labor.\\" ETNAM's Founder, Salih Hudayar, appeared as a special guest on Steve K Bannon's War Room Pandemic show on April 13, 2020 and briefly spoke about East Turkistan and the Uyghurs. On June 19, 2020, ETNAM held a demonstration in front of the White House to thank President Donald J Trump and the United States for passing and signing the Uyghur Human Rights Policy Act. ETNAM also called on for independence for East Turkistan and condemned China's oppression of Uyghur and other Turkic peoples.  ICC Case  On July 6, 2020, the New York Times and The Wall Street Journal reported that the East Turkistan National Awakening Movement and the East Turkistan Government in Exile filed a complaint urging the International Criminal Court (ICC) to investigate and prosecute Chinese officials for genocide and other crimes against humanity. The complaint is the first attempt to us an international legal forum to challenge China over allegations of extensive human rights abuses against Muslim Turkic people in East Turkistan. The 80-page complaint included a list of more than 30 senior Chinese officials, including Chinese Communist Party general secretary Xi Jinping, whom the Uyghurs hold responsible. The next day, East Turkistan Government in Exile and the East Turkistan National Awakening Movement held an online press conference in Washington, DC and The Hague. ETGE Prime Minister and founder of ETNAM, Salih Hudayar, told Radio Free Asia's Chinese service that \\"for too long we have been oppressed by China and its Communist Party and we have suffered so much that the genocide of our people can be no longer ignored.\\" On July 9, 2020, the US Government sanctioned 3 senior Chinese officials including Xinjiang Party Secretary Chen Quanguo and Zhu Hailun who were among the 30 officials mentioned in the complaint to the ICC. ETGE Prime Minister Salih Hudayar told Radio Free Asia that the East Turkistan Government in Exile welcomed the sanctions and that Uyghurs wanted real justice. He stated that the Chinese officials should be put on trial like the Nazis during the Nuremberg Trials.

The film centers on Leonhard Seppala and his titular sled dog in the 1925 serum run to Nome to transport diphtheria antitoxin serum through harsh conditions during an epidemic of diphtheria. The film stars Willem Dafoe, Julianne Nicholson, Christopher Heyerdahl, Michael Gaston, Michael McElhatton, Jamie McShane, Michael Greyeyes, Thorbj√∏rn Harr, Shaun Benson and Nikolai Nikolaeff. It was released on Disney+ on December 20, 2019. Plot The film flashes between musher Leonhard Seppala raising his dog Togo and the 1925 serum run to Nome. In 1913, Seppala and his wife Constance welcome a newborn Siberian Husky pup. While Seppala insists on immediately retiring him due to his small and weak state, Constance convinces him to raise him with the rest. The puppy Husky turns out to be a handful as he constantly escapes the kennel to usurp Seppala's dog team while he is out training them. After trying to get rid of the Husky twice, Seppala decides to have him run with the others where, to his astonishment, he discovers that he is energetic enough to outrun the other dogs. He decides to call him Togo, after admiral T≈çg≈ç Heihachir≈ç, and fully trains him to the point where he successfully wins the All Alaska Sweepstakes, earning both Togo and himself some local fame. In 1925, a diphtheria outbreak occurs; mostly affecting children. Mayor George Maynard plans to have the serum flown in from Nenana, but this proves to be impossible due to the severity of the weather. Eventually, Seppala is convinced to take Togo and the other dogs to collect the serum and race back. Constance becomes concerned due to Togo being 12-years-old (old for dog age), but Seppala insists on going. Seppala and his team tread through stormy weather and take a break at an outpost where a local doctor named Atiqtalik tells him that Togo is tired. Seppala continues on for miles; taking a dangerous shortcut across the now frozen Norton Sound. Eventually, Seppala meets up with a fellow musher, Henry Ivanov, who was bringing the serum back and he is able to leave the next day. Seppala and his team head across the Sound again where he is forced to have Togo pull a piece of ice that they are stuck on as the Sound begins to crack apart. Reuniting with Atiqtalik, she tells him Togo is dying. Nevertheless, Seppala gets his team back to Joe Dexter's outpost as he, Togo and team recuperate. The serum is passed off to fellow musher Gunnar Kaasen who arrives back in Nome. A reporter, confusing him for being the sole musher, announces his dog Balto as the hero who saved Nome, disappointing Constance. Seppala returns to Nome later, where the entire town come to his house to celebrate Togo's success. Seppala later becomes upset when a cured girl named Sally deduces that Togo is dying. Seppala intends to continue training his dogs without Togo (who gained a small injury during the run), but he refuses to stop and chases down Seppala who welcomes him with open arms. Over the next two years, Togo welcomes puppies of his own that prove to be famous in their own right. Togo eventually passes away in 1929 with Seppala continuing to train dogs. A title card at the end reveals that while Balto had received a statue in his honor, Togo is remembered for making the longest run and for being the true hero of Nome. Cast Production On October 28, 2015, it was announced that Walt Disney Pictures was developing a film about the 1925 serum run to Nome focusing on the sled dog Togo and his owner Leonhard Seppala. The screenplay was set to be written by Tom Flynn and the production was to be overseen by Jessica Virtue and Louie Provost for Disney. On May 16, 2018, it was announced that Ericson Core would direct the film, that Kim Zubick would serve as a producer, and that the film would debut on Disney+. Additionally, it was further announced that Willem Dafoe would star in the film as Leonhard Seppala, the owner of Togo. On December 10, 2018, it was reported that Thorbj√∏rn Harr had joined the cast of the film. Principal photography for the film commenced on September 21, 2018 and finished in February 2019 in Cochrane, Alberta. Most of the dogs featured in this film are from The Snowy Owl Sled Dog Tours Inc. kennel located in Canmore, AB. Hugo and Mackey from Snowy Owl were used throughout the movie as stunt doubles for the face of Togo, Diesel. Diesel, the main dog actor who plays Togo, is a CKC registered Siberian Husky from Newfoundland, CA . He is a direct descendant of the real life Togo, going back 14 generations . Historical accuracy The movie, for the most part, remains faithful to the story of Leonhard Seppala and Togo. Two of the more \\"cinematic\\" moments in the film that actually did happen in real life include Togo escaping his second owner by jumping through a glass window and Togo using his strength to pull Seppala's sled out of the Norton Sound. The movie however, excludes Seppala and Constance's daughter Sigrid who was among the many children who was at risk of contracting diphtheria. Seppala's reaction to Balto getting the credit is not shown, though Constance is shown to be rather annoyed by the news. In real life, Seppala openly voiced his disapproval of the dog hero mix-up. In addition, the film depicts Seppala's sled team as being composed of 11 dogs, with Togo as the only lead dog. In real life, Togo was assisted in leading by another dog named Fritz. Also, in the film, Gunnar Kaasen's team is composed of only 10 dogs. In real life, Kaasen's team consisted of 13 dogs. Also, Balto strongly resembles the way he looked in real life, except that he has blue eyes as opposed to the dark brown eyes that he had in real life. The movie also depicts Togo living out the rest of his days with Seppala while in real life, Togo was given away to a fellow musher named Elizabeth Ricker in Maine. On parting with his best dog, Seppala stated, \\"It was sad parting on a cold, gray March morning, when Togo raised a small paw to my knee as if questioning why he was not going along with me. I never had a better dog than Togo. His stamina, loyalty, and intelligence could not be improved upon. Togo was the best dog that ever traveled the Alaska trail.\\" Seppala did visit Togo a couple of times and was by his side when he was euthanized. Togo's line was bred and preserved, as portrayed in the film; his descendants are known as the \\"Seppala Siberian Sleddog\\", a sought after sled dog line. Release Togo was originally scheduled to be released on Disney+ on December 13, 2019, but was eventually moved and released a week later on December 20, 2019. Reception Critical response On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 91% and an average rating of 8/10, based on 34 reviews. The website's critical consensus reads: \\"An endearing and exciting underdog story that benefits greatly from its stars (canine and human alike), Togo is a timeless tale, well-told.\\" At Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 69 out of 100, based on 8 critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\".

After an extensive search lasting several weeks, her body was found in dense scrub approximately 40 km away. Police consider the case to be a homicide, and it remains one of the highest-profile unsolved murders in New Zealand.  Early life  Kirsty Marianne Bentley was born on 18 January 1983 at the Christchurch Women's Hospital. She was the second child of her parents, Jill and Sidney Bentley; she had an older brother John. Bentley was by all accounts a normal teenager. Her mother has described her as vibrant, honest and compassionate. She was confident and direct with people she knew, but could be shy and reserved with those she did not. Bentley had a strong creative streak that she expressed through drama classes and poetry. She attended Ashburton College, and at school she was well liked and had a close- knit friend group. She had recently begun dating a local boy from one of her classes.  Disappearance  Ashburton, which Bentley went missing from. The dog, Abby, was found tied up in the area of trees in the centre of the image. On the day of her disappearance, Bentley met a friend at the Ashburton library at around 10:30am on 31 December 1998. After doing some shopping, they had lunch at McDonald's around midday. Bentley was dropped off at her home by her friend's sister at around 2:30pm. After returning home, her brother John told her that her boyfriend had called and left a message, asking her to call him back. Phone records show she made a call to her boyfriend at 2:38pm, but he wasn't there so she left a message asking him to call her back. From here, it appears Bentley decided to take the family's black Labrador dog, Abby, for a walk. This was not unusual for Bentley; she often took the dog for a walk to pass the time. John did not hear her leaving the house. A neighbour witnessed her walking by his house with the dog at 3:05pm, but from this point on the exact timeline of what happened to her cannot be clearly established.  Search  Bentley's boyfriend called back at 4:30pm, and at this time John noticed his sister was still absent. When his mother, Jill, returned home from work at around 5:15pm, he immediately told her Bentley had not come home. After calling Bentley's boyfriend to confirm he did not know where Kirsty was, Jill conducted the first search, by walking the route Bentley would normally take down to the Ashburton River. However, she was becoming increasingly anxious and soon decided to turn back. After returning to the house, she and John agreed to wait until 6pm before conducting another search, in case Kirsty came home of her own accord. John left to search the dog walking route just before 6pm, and shortly afterwards Kirsty's father, Sid, returned home. When he was told Kirsty was missing, he immediately notified police. After Police became involved the search rapidly grew more intense throughout the evening, with a mixture of police staff, family members and friends canvassing the area looking for Bentley. This first search continued through the entire night. Nothing was found. The official Search and Rescue operation began at 8am the next day. At around 10am, the family dog, Abby, was found tied to a tree in a patch of dense foliage beside the Ashburton River, close to Robilliard Park. The general area had been searched the previous night, but the dog had not been found; the dense foliage means it is possible she was missed during this search. The dog was found tied to a tree with a lead of the same type that the family owned, however the family initially believed the lead did not belong to them. Nearby two items of clothing, underwear and boxer shorts, were found. These were later confirmed to belong to Bentley. Over the next 16 days, police and volunteers meticulously searched the Ashburton area of Canterbury. Initially the search was focused on the Ashburton township but it expanded out to cover a much larger area of Canterbury. The New Zealand Army sent troops from Burnham Military Camp to help in the effort also.  Discovery  The area of Camp Gully, Rakaia, where Bentley's body was discovered. On 17 January, two men in the Camp Gully area of Rakaia, roughly 40 km away from Ashburton, found a badly decomposed human body lying in a patch of overgrown scrub and planted pine. The body was later confirmed to be Bentley's. The body was lying at the bottom of a steep embankment, covered in a thin layer of branches and leaves. She had been placed in the fetal position and was fully clothed in what she had last been seen wearing, with the exception of the underwear that had previously been found at the scene of her disappearance. A large paddock was at the top of an embankment above her, and the location was close to State Highway 72, part of the Inland Scenic Route. The area she was found is known for being used by illegal cannabis growers, and the men who found her were out looking for a cannabis patch. Initially they were reluctant to contact police, but decided the discovery was too important not to report.  Investigation  After the discovery, Police closed the scene and ordered a no-fly zone over the area as they conducted their investigation. They conducted an extensive scene examination over several days, and took plaster casts of tire tracks in the area. It was the height of summer, and so Bentley's body was in an advanced state of decomposition. She was recovered and transported to Christchurch Hospital where a post-mortem was conducted. It took three days before dental records were used to formally identify the body. Bentley was killed by blunt force trauma to the right-side of the back of her head. The blow or blows was inflicted with enough force to severely fracture her skull. The pathologist determined she would have died shortly after the wound was inflicted. Police initially withheld her cause of death from the public for operational reasons. The pathologist believed she was killed soon after she went missing, and that is was likely that she was placed in the Camp Gully area the same night, based on an examination of her stomach contents and the state of her body. Police asked for help from the public regarding vehicles that may have been seen in the area at the time. They also asked for cannabis growers to come forward if they had seen anything. These calls to the public did not reveal anything useful.  Funeral  A funeral for Bentley was held at St Stephen's Anglican Church in Ashburton on 25 January 1999. Between 500 and 700 people attended. Bentley's body was cremated, and her ashes sealed in a steel urn. The urn was buried in a specially planted memorial garden at the family home. After Sid's death in 2015, the ashes were transferred to Bentley's mother, Jill.  Media coverage  Media coverage of the case was extensive, making it one of the most high-profile unsolved crimes in New Zealand history. At the time, all major news outlets in New Zealand closely followed the case. The intensity of the coverage was both a help and a hindrance to the investigation. For instance, the men who found her body cited seeing Bentley's mother on evening news television broadcasts as the reason they had decided to come forward, despite the fact they were engaged in an illegal activity when they found her. However, the relationship between the media and the police and family was also strained at times. Decisions by media to publish reports that Bentley's body had been discovered before she had been formally identified were publicly criticised by police. In addition, the family expressed distress at the pressure they received from media during the several days that Bentley's body remained formally unidentified.  Suspects  Police have stated that hundreds of individuals have been considered suspects at one time or another, and a list of several hundred people have never been formally eliminated from the enquiry. At times the list of suspects has been as small as 20 people. Some possible suspects have received media attention in relation to the case.  Sid and John Bentley  At an early stage in the case, media reported that Sid and John were considered suspects in Kirsty's disappearance. Both denied any involvement, although John acknowledged in media interviews that it was only common sense that police should consider them as suspects. Police later confirmed that they were considered suspects in the investigation. Police conducted a scene examination at the family home in the early stages of the investigation, including carrying out Luminol testing. However the tests did not find anything of value to the investigation. Sid was unable to provide a strong alibi for his whereabouts on that day. He initially claimed he had been in Christchurch and Lyttelton at the time, but later claimed he had hit his head on a cupboard door and forgotten that he had actually been in Ashburton for part of the day. His exact whereabouts at the time remain unknown. Family members have stated they believe Sid was embarrassed to admit whatever it was that he was doing on that day, but they do not believe he was involved in the murder in any way. Police later consulted retired British Detective Inspector Chuck Burton, who stated that in his opinion, the perpetrator was likely to have known Bentley and been close with her, based on the nature of the crime and the way her body was left at Camp Gully. Despite this, police never laid charges against either Sid or John, suggesting no strong evidence of their involvement was ever found. In 2018, Police confirmed they do not believe Sid or John were involved in the crime.  Green van  In the months after Bentley's death, Police asked the public for information about a green Commer van, registration number EP9888, that was of interest to the inquiry. The van was described as a 1961 model set up to be used as a camper, with a distinctive Commer branding badge attached to the front. The van was either blue or a faded blue-green. It was last registered with the NZTA in 1995. This type of van was commonly used by tourists and drifters at the time, and in many cases these vehicles were not registered. The van was rare; as few as 2 matching its general description are believed to have ever been in New Zealand. An experienced mechanic originally reported the van to police after seeing it in the area around the time of Bentley's disappearance. Due to the distinctive nature of the van and the man's experience with them, he took special note of the van at the time and was able to give a highly detailed description of it. The van was also seen by other witnesses in the Ashburton area in the weeks before Bentley's disappearance, and there were reports it was also seen in the Camp Gully area. Police believed that such a distinctive vehicle could not go unnoticed by the public, and a sighting could lead to a break in the case. Many people came forward to police with possible sightings, but all were discounted as not being the van that police were seeking; the distinctive nature of the van made it very easy for them to rule out mistaken sightings. No further leads on the camper were ever revealed, and it has never been found. In addition to this, police distributed fliers asking for information on a girl seen near the van on Chalmers Avenue, close to where Bentley had disappeared. The girl was known to the dairy owners in the suburb of Netherby as a customer. However, despite this, and repeated public requests by police, the girl never came forward. Her identity and her connection to the suspicious van remains unknown.  Russell John Tully  In March 2017 media reported that police were investigating whether Russell John Tully, a local man who murdered two staff members at the Ashburton Work and Income office in 2014, may have been involved. Tully had been known to camp in the area of Ashburton from which Kirsty went missing. Tully strongly denied any involvement. In May 2018 Police announced they had eliminated Tully from the enquiry. He had provided a detailed account of where he had been living and working during the time Bentley disappeared. Police confirmed he had not originally been interviewed because he was living in Nelson at the time, and was no longer suspected of any involvement.  Others  After Sid's death in 2015, an unidentified woman came forward to say that she suspected her ex-boyfriend had been involved in the murder. He had been a suspect in the original investigation, and they had both been interviewed by police and media at the time in relation to the case. According to an interview with her in 2015, her ex-boyfriend, while intoxicated, had admitted his involvement to her on several occasions. It is unclear whether she ever came forward to formally change her statement to police.  Recent developments  In 2014 the case was transferred from Detective Inspector Greg Williams to Detective Inspector Greg Murton. At the time he commented that the investigation was open and would continue to be until it was resolved. In 2015 Bentley's father, Sid, died of esophageal cancer. His death briefly renewed public interest in the case. In 2018, Police confirmed that Russell John Tully was no longer of interest to the enquiry. In late 2018, almost 20 years after the disappearance, Detective Inspector Murton announced that there had been advances in DNA testing that he hoped could lead to a break in the case. Items of evidence including the dog lead and underwear have been submitted for further testing at Environmental Science and Research. The case is still under active investigation, with Detective Inspector Murton stating in 2018 that, \\"the case is still open and being investigated.\\" See also *List of solved missing persons cases *List of unsolved murders  References   Further reading  * Category:1983 births' Category:1990s missing person cases Category:1990s murders in New Zealand Category:1998 deaths Category:1998 crimes in New Zealand Category:1998 murders in Oceania Category:Female murder victims Category:Formerly missing people found dead Category:Missing person cases in New Zealand Category:Murder in New Zealand Category:New Zealand murder victims Category:People murdered in New Zealand Category:Unsolved murders in New Zealand Category:Violence against children ","title":"Kirsty Bentley"},{"id":"57905126","text":"Evgeny Konstantinovich Karlovskiy (; born 7 August 1994) is a Russian tennis player.

He was born in Gaolong, Chaling County, Hunan Province. His courtesy name was Wenqing (). He was the father of Tan Yankai, a politician of the Republic of China. Biography In 1856 (the 5th year of the Xianfeng reign) he passed the metropolitan-level imperial examination and was awarded the jinshi degree, and was admitted to the Hanlin Academy first with the scholastic title of Shujishi, years later as bianxiu, a compiler and secretary. In 1863, he was yushi, investigating censor; in this capacity he was the leader of more than 40 officials who successfully petitioned Empress Dowager Cixi to exonerate Prince Gong. Tan won his fame and drew positive attention from the leading politicians as well as the Empress. In 1866, he was appointed the Prefect of Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province. In 1868, recommended by Li Hongzhang, he was appointed the Judicial Commissioner of Henan Province. In 1871, recommended by Zuo Zongtang, Tan became the Provincial Administration Commissioner of Shaanxi; next year he was advanced to Officiating Lieutenant Governor, and later the Acting Governor of Shaanxi. In 1875 (the first year of reign of Guangxu Emperor), Tan was appointed Governor of Shaanxi mainly because of his contribution to the victory by supplying Zuo's army when it battled Muslim rebels in Xinjiang. Zuo and Tan became close friends and partners in implementing Manchu policy of suppressing Muslim rebellion in Northwest China. In 1879, Tan was appointed the Governor of Zhejiang, with extra rank of the Minister of Military Affairs. During his tenure in Zhejiang, he rebuilt the imperial Wenlan Library damaged by the Taiping Rebellion, and restored the housing of the recovered volumes of the collection of Siku quanshu (the Complete Library of Four Treasure). In 1881, Tan was appointed the Viceroy of Shaanxi and Gansu Provinces, worked hard to promote local agriculture and increased fiscal revenues. In 1883, he and Liu Jintang submitted a memorial proposing the creation of the Province of Xinjiang in order to have better control of the region; the proposal was approved and the Province of Xinjiang was put under the administration of the Viceroy of Shaanxi and Gansu Provinces. In 1892, he was appointed the Viceroy of Zhejiang and Fujian Provinces, he reformed the Foochow Arsenal and improved its efficiency and production. In 1895, he was appointed the Viceroy of Guangdong and Guangxi Provinces. He suppressed the Canton uprising led by Sun Yat-sen and executed Lu Haodong of the Revolutionary Party. Tan reported to the throne against the Hundred Days' Reform, and it was highly appreciated by conservative Empress Dowager Cixi. In 1899, Tan resigned to live in Changsha of his home province as he opposed to Hong Kong's New Territories' Lease to the UK and the Guangzhouwan to France. He died of illness in 1905, but was awarded an honorary posthumous name Wen qin () due to his loyalty and achievements.

One of the world's most successful horse-drawn vehicle makers they formed with their Flint neighbours a core of the American automobile industry. In 1905 Flint was promoting itself as Flint the Vehicle City. Flint Wagon Works brought the automotive industry to Flint by buying David Buick's Detroit business and moving it to Flint. Overburdened with debt and litigation Flint Wagon Works shareholders sold their business to William C. Durant as of October 12, 1911. Durant took the useful parts of the business and began to manufacture Little automobiles. Sales were hindered by poor quality product and their unappealing brandname and Durant put Little into Chevrolet in 1913. Founding { James H. Whiting (1842-1919) Josiah W. Begole (1815-1896) Flint Wagon Works began business after James H.

Durant moved manufacture to the former plant of Imperial Wheel in Jackson, assembly remained in Flint where the bodies were made by Flint Wagon Works. Durant's friend, Sam McLaughlin of Canada's McLaughlin Motor Car Company, offshoot of another major carriage manufacturer, was one of the early customers for the engines because McLaughlin's own in- house design was not ready when their car production began. The manufacture of complete Buicks moved to Hamilton's Farm ‚Äî Oak Park, Flint ‚Äî but the engines did not follow until some years later. Buick engines continued to be made in the same building until 1908 or 1909. 1910 Flint Wagon Works' cars Whiting automobiles Demand for Flint Wagon Works' horse-drawn vehicles maintained its steady decline in the face of the rapidly rising automobile trade. Flint Wagon Works let it be known in early 1909 they were developing new automobiles which would be available in 1910. Their Whiting model A and Whiting Model C were displayed at the Detroit Auto Show in January 1910. The Model A was a light four-cylinder two-passenger roadster with an engine rated at 20 hp and the Model C was a five-passenger touring car with a four-cylinder motor rated at 40 hp. Both were of conventional design. Flint Wagon Works then fell deep into well-publicised and expensive litigation over their use of Selden patent designs in their new engines.New Cars at Detroit. Motor Age, January 27, 1910, Chicago At first the Whiting cars were built in Detroit and Flint-made bodies were added to them then the whole production process was moved to Flint . Some 1200 Whiting cars were sold in 1910 but in the fall of 1910 Flint Wagon Works failed to make a loan repayment and their bank took control appointing a special board of directors.

Terminal difficulties Flint Wagon Works was in severe financial difficulties by the beginning of 1911.

It is a common and widespread, slender ground orchid with a single leaf and up to fifteen small white and greenish flowers with reddish or brownish markings and a hairy labellum. Description Eriochilus dilatatus is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber. Plants in flower have a single, egg-shaped leaf long and wide and attached about half way up the flowering stem. Plants not in flower usually have a larger leaf on a stalk tall. Up to fifteen, usually more than three white and greenish flowers long and wide are borne on a flowering stem tall. The dorsal sepal is spatula- shaped, long and wide. The lateral sepals are white or cream-coloured, long and wide. The petals are greenish with brownish-red stripes, long, about wide and more or less erect. The labellum is greenish cream, long and wide with clusters of cream-coloured to pale purple hairs, and is prominently curved downwards. Flowering occurs between March and June with some subspecies flowering more prolifically after fire. Taxonomy, naming and distribution Eriochilus dilatatus was first formally described in 1840 by John Lindley and the description was published in A Sketch of the Vegetation of the Swan River Colony. The specific epithet (dilatatus) is a Latin word meaning \\"spread out\\", \\"enlarge\\", or \\"extend\\", referring to the broad labellum and lateral sepals. There are six subspecies: * E. dilatatus subsp. dilatatus which grows in shrubland and woodland in near-coastal areas between Dirk Hartog Island and Israelite Bay; * E. dilatatus subsp. brevifolius which grows in shrubland between Cataby and the Murchison River; * E. dilatatus subsp. magnus which grows in high rainfall areas between Perth and Albany; * E. dilatatus subsp. multiflorus found in woodland and forest between Jurien Bay and Albany; * E. dilatatus subsp. orientalis which is only found near Caiguna; * E. dilatatus subsp. undulatus which is the most widespread subspecies and grows in a range of habitats between Mullewa and Esperance. Ecology All bunny orchids are pollinated by small native bees, attracted to nectar at the base of the labellum. Use in horticulture Eriochilus species are generally easily grown in pots in a bushhouse or cool glasshouse. They need to be watered regularly when growing but kept dry when dormant during summer.

It is located within North Cascades National Park. It rises steeply from Diablo Lake, one of the reservoirs on the Skagit River. It is part of a group of peaks that form the northern end of a chain running south through climbing destinations such as Colonial Peak and Snowfield Peak. The nearest peak to Paul Bunyans Stump is Pinnacle Peak, to the north, and the nearest higher peak is Neve Peak, to the southeast. Like many North Cascade peaks, Paul Bunyans Stump is more notable for its large, steep rise above local terrain than for its absolute elevation. Precipitation runoff from the mountain drains into Diablo Lake and Skagit River. Paul Bunyans Stump was first climbed on August 2, 1931 by William Degenhardt and Herbert Strandberg of the Seattle Mountaineers. They called it \\"What's the Matterhorn.\\" The approach is via the Pyramid Lake Trail, starting near Diablo Dam on the North Cascades Highway. From the lake, it's route-finding up Pyramid Arm and to Colonial Glacier. The standard route is a scramble on the southwest slope after accessing the Colonial Glacier. Climate Paul Bunyans Stump is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach the North Cascades, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades (Orographic lift). As a result, the west side of the North Cascades experiences high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer.Beckey, p. 16 Because of maritime influence, snow tends to be wet and heavy, resulting in high avalanche danger. Geology Paul Bunyans Stump seen from Neve Peak with Pinnacle Peak to right The North Cascades features some of the most rugged topography in the Cascade Range with craggy peaks, spires, ridges, and deep glacial valleys. Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to the various climate differences. The history of the formation of the Cascade Mountains dates back millions of years ago to the late Eocene Epoch. With the North American Plate overriding the Pacific Plate, episodes of volcanic igneous activity persisted. In addition, small fragments of the oceanic and continental lithosphere called terranes created the North Cascades about 50 million years ago. During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured the landscape leaving deposits of rock debris. The \\"U\\"-shaped cross section of the river valleys are a result of recent glaciation. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the North Cascades area.

Of these four pairs of suffect consuls, he was able to identify and date the tenures of all of them except for the pair Julianus and Castus.

The last passenger train through the station was on 25 November 1983.Station signage, visible at https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:HayRailwayStationSign.JPG The station was restored to its original heritage colours in 1992 and underwent restoration of the exterior roofing and paving of the platform in 2003-04. The station building is now leased by the Hay Shire Council and houses the local community radio station, 2HAYFM, and the POW & Internment Camp Interpretive Centre ‚Äì Dunera Museum. It formerly housed the Hay Employment Training Centre in the early 1990s.  Description  The brick station building is a type 5 first class design with a brick platform dating from 1882. The corrugated iron goods shed is a through shed with awning 60 ft by 16 ft. The station complex also includes a timber framed rivetted steel tank made by Albion Engine Works at Pyrmont dating from 1881 and a jib crane. The former stationmaster's residence is a brick residence of a type 3 design with a pyramid roof, located in Murray Street. It was sold 1994 and is no longer included in the station's heritage listing.  Heritage listing  Hay is a very significant railway site in the State system. The station building reflects political developments between the States and interstate rivalries that resulted in the construction of a grand building at an important freight site. The whole complex indicates the importance of the site in the production of wool and the policy of shipping it to Sydney rather than through the southern states. The line was opened in response to an aggressive Victorian economic policy offering special rebates for shipping grain through Victoria. There was an unstated plan for the line to be extended to Adelaide through Hay and the scale of the building is evidence of this. The buildings are of very high quality with fine detailing and are among the most important structures in the State. It is the only first class station in the State not to be built on a main line or at a major junction which gives it added significance. All of the buildings and structures at Hay are of high significance and it is important that the site be retained as a whole.

His other discoveries include the Saugus Iron Works and the John and Priscilla Alden Family Sites. Early life Robbins was born on March 21, 1908, in Worcester, Massachusetts. He dropped out of high school in 1924 and went to work as an office boy at R.G. Dun & Co. He later worked for two employment agencies and was manager of the Boston Reference Bureau. During the Great Depression, Robbins was unable to find steady work, working as a handyman, house painter, and window-washer. He moved to Vermont. While there he collected tales and stories from local newspapers that he used to form the basis of his first book, Thru the Covered Bridge. He returned to the Boston area in 1934 and moved to Lincoln, Massachusetts, in 1936. In 1942, while washing windows he engaged in a discussion on Daniel Chester French's statue, Minute Man. The statue was being reproduced across the country as a national symbol during World War II, but little was known about the statue or its creator. He began researching and in 1945 he published Story of the Minute Man. Archaeology Thoreau site On July 4, 1945, the 100th anniversary of Henry David Thoreau's first day at Walden Pond, Robbins decided to look for the site of Thoreau's cabin. He used Walden and notes on the house by William Ellery Channing as a reference. On November 12, 1945, he located the chimney foundations of Thoreau's house in Concord, Massachusetts. He began lecturing on his discovery and documented it in his book Discovery at Walden. In 1964, Robbins reproduced Thoreau's cabin in his backyard and opened the building to the public. Robbin's replica was visited by hundreds of people, including P. B. Gajendragadkar and Toshi and Pete Seeger. Saugus Iron Works In September 1948, First Iron Works Association president J. Sanger Attwill approached Robbins about trying to find the site of the Iron Works. Robbins was interested in the idea of digging at a site that was over three hundred years old, the challenge of working on a site where there little information, including no plans or sketches, and the opportunity to work at what may have been the first iron-manufacturing plant in the American colonies. Robbins' excavations uncovered the major manufacturing units of the Iron Works, including the foundations of buildings, remains of the blast furnace, holding ponds, and canal, a 500-pound hammer used in the forge, and a waterwheel that powered the bellows for the blast furnace, along with its wheel pit. In total, more than 5,000 artifacts were found. Robbins abruptly left the Iron Works in 1953, not long after a dispute with Quincy Bent of the American Iron and Steel Institute (the financial backer of the project), who wanted Robbins to give tours of the excavation site on weekends in addition to his other duties. Robbins also clashed with the project's architects, who he thought were ignorant about and uninterested in archeological data, and was upset with the FIWA's decision to base the reconstruction of the Iron Works primarily on documentary, rather than archeological, evidence. Other work Robbins also discovered the sites of the John and Priscilla Alden home in Duxbury, Massachusetts, the remains of Thomas Jefferson's birthplace in Shadwell, Virginia, Fort Crown Point, Sterling Iron Works in Tuxedo, New York, duPont's Powder Rolling Mills in Wilmington, Delaware, the Sleepy Hollow Restorations in Tarrytown, New York, Samuel Parris's parsonage in Danvers, Massachusetts, John Winthrop Jr. Iron Furnace Site in Quincy, Massachusetts, mill sites in Moore State Park, and a Revolutionary War encampment site on Talcott Mountain.

The structure around the spring was built circa 1912 in the Vernacular architectural style.  History  The land on which the spring sits was purchased by the Voegtly family from William Robinson Jr., the first mayor of Allegheny City, in 1864. The land around the area was continuously owned by members and descendants of the Voegtly family, aside from certain small portions being sold, for the next few decades.Deed Book Vol. 2069, p.527, County Recorder's Office, Pittsburgh, Pa. This remained the case until John Voegtly died without heirs, and left the portion of the property that housed the spring to his sister, Sarah V. Crone. Sarah maintained the property until her death in the 1930s, when she stipulated that her estate should be divided between the Tuberculosis Hospital of Pittsburgh at Leech Farm and the Allegheny Association for the Improvement of the Poor. By the time of her death though, the two groups had become owned by the City of Pittsburgh and the Family Welfare Association of Allegheny County, so the remaining heirs made an agreement with the two parties to have the properties transferred back to the Voegtly family in return for a fee paid to each agency.Deed Book Vol. 2445, p.38, County Recorder's Office, Pittsburgh, Pa. The spring would remain in the hands of the Voegtly family until it was eventually purchased by the City of Pittsburgh. It was members of the Voegtly family though that channeled the spring and maintained it. The first recording of the spring was from maps of Allegheny City in 1882 which record a stream running down Spring Hill. The Voegtly family opened the spring for public access for nearly fifty years before a structure was built around it.B.A. Overbeck & Harry C. Koehler, Petition for the Preservation of Spring on the Old Voegtly Farm, Robinson Road, 24th Ward, City, Petition, April 3, 1912. Despite the fact that the land was owned by the Voegtly family, it was actually the City that built the structure around the spring.Charles A. Finley, Bureau of Water Superintendent, Letter to Joseph G. Armstrong, Esq. Director, Department of Public Works, June 3, 1912. Following a petition by members of the community, the City formally asked permission from the Voegtly family to build a permanent catch basin for the spring, which was granted in 1912. The spring continued to provide a valuable source of water to the community for the following years. Given the geography of the Spring Hill neighborhood, it was difficult for the houses at the top of the hill to have consistent sources of water.Jordan, Bruce W. ‚ÄúThe Allegheny City Water Works, 1840-1907.‚Äù The Western Pennsylvania Historical Magazine. January 1987 vol. 70, No. 1. pp.29-52. See also, Map of Water Distribution System 1882. This led to the prevalence, and importance, of natural spring water in the area, which is what gave the neighborhood its name. The spring was particularly invaluable during the 1936 ‚ÄúSt. Patrick‚Äôs Day Flood‚Äù which caused significant damage to the city's water and led to a decrease in the availability of drinking water.‚ÄúWater Supply Assured City, Pumps Running.‚Äù Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. March 21, 1936. During this time local businesses, hospitals, and residents turned to the springs for their water. Voegtly Spring remained operational up until the early 1950s.‚ÄúNo Teeth Anyway,‚Äù The Pittsburgh Press, December 28, 1952. However, due to construction of houses above the spring, the water became tainted and by the late 1950s the spring was cemented shut.Allegheny Assessment Report for 47-L-44. This remained the case until mid-2016 when the spring was renovated and reopened to the public for drinking by city officials. The spring was nominated in January 2016 to become a City Historic Landmark by Preservation Pittsburgh.  Architecture  The structure around the spring was originally done in the vernacular architectural style. Vernacular architecture is considered to be architecture based on local construction reflecting local needs without using formally-schooled architects, but rather design skills of local builders.Leland Roth, American Architecture, A History (Boulder, Co.: Westview Press, 2001), pp. 330-332. This is the case with Voegtly Spring, as the bottom of the structure is entirely concrete, and the top a mixture of cement and rocks from the hillside. The spring is the only remaining spring in Pittsburgh, of the three left, that does not adhere to any particular design style.

After the 1911 revolution, the system was banned in China but this was never effectively enforced. In 1917, the Mui Tsai issue reemerged because of a legal case involving two Mui Tsai who had been kidnapped. A British member of Parliament who happened to be passing through town took the case to the Colonial Office. He questioned how slavery could not only be tolerated but could even be protected by law in the British Empire. In the 1920s and 1930s, there was an increased interest in social welfare. This led to the debates about prostitution and Mui Tsai. When the British occupied Hong Kong in 1841 (British Hong Kong), they proclaimed that the Chinese would be governed according to their own laws and customs. This had been the position of the colonial government on the question Anti-Mui Tsai groups pushed it to change. Chinese activists in Hong Kong, including Christians who were educated abroad, labor organizers, feminists and members of the Hong Kong Anti-Mui Tsai Society were involved in the debate of prostitution and Mui Tsai.  Anti-Mui Tsai Campaign  By 1920, a campaign against Mui Tsai was created by European missionaries and Christian Chinese. The Anti-Mui Tsai Campaign had three main differences from that of the 1880s. It focused more on the system itself rather than prostitution. This time, the campaign had help from different places: British women in Hong Kong, small groups of local Chinese members of Parliament in Britain, religious leaders, and international women's groups. The Colonial Office started to receive complaints from these groups.  Anti- Mui Tsai Society  In July 1921, there was a meeting held at the Tai Ping Theatre and The Society for the Protection of Mui Tsai was created by local elites. The Anti-Mui Tsai Society was formed after the meeting in opposition. The Anti-Mui Tsai Society wrote a manifesto following the meeting. The manifesto states that the system was injurious to public morality, it was subversive of righteousness, and it was damaging to the national body (dasun guoti). The manifesto mentioned that representatives of Europe and America had met in Berlin in 1885 and outlawed the slave trade. Therefore, it would be damaging to the Chinese national body to continue such trade within or outside the country. The Anti-Mui Tsai Society was dissatisfied with reform since it could not remove the root cause of the problem. Revelations by the Anti-Mui Tsai Society about the ongoing abuse of Mui Tsai caused international observers to become interested in the issue. They received backing from local groups such as the Young Women's Christian Association and was able to gain support from the foreign community and many labor unions. English secretary C.G. Anderson supported the society and helped by writing to the newspapers in Hong Kong and Britain.  Legislations  In February 1922, the Anti-Slavery Society organized a conference of twenty-two societies to discuss the matter of Mui Tsai. A week later, the Secretary for the Colonies Winston Churchill argued to the House of Commons that the system should be abolished. A meeting was held on January 15, 1923. The chairman of the Chinese Seamen's Union participated and showed willingness to adopt the Mui Tsai question as a labor issue. The Female Domestic Service Ordinance was passed in 1923. The Mui Tsai issue reemerged after the Canton government abolished all forms of slavery in March 1927. In October 1928, the Anti-Mui Tsai Society declared that conditions had become worse since 1923 and sent details to groups in Britain. The bill ended up doing very little, except mainly to prohibit any new Mui Tsai transactions and domestic service for girls under ten years of age. When the secretary of the Anti-Slavery and Aborigines Protection Society learned about the situation, letters were written to the Manchester Guardian that was soon published. Many British activists who had been involved in the campaign in the early 1920s resurfaced. They distributed articles with titles such as \\"Little Yellow Slaves under the Union Jack\\". Further agitation began when the practice was outlawed in neighboring Kwantung (Guandong) Province the same year. This caused the Anti-Mui Tsai Society to become even more upset about the issue remaining unsolved in their province. In 1929, in response to pressure from Anti-Mui Tsai groups, the Legislative Council passed an amendment stating that Mui Tsai were to be registered and paid wages. The new colonial secretary, Passfield, told Clementi to put Part III of the 1923 ordinance into immediate effect and send six monthly reports on the progress. All Mui Tsai had to be registered before June 1, 1930 and further imports were forbidden. 4,268 girls were registered. The Anti-Mui Tsai Society claimed that fewer than half of the Mui Tsai was actually registered. In July 1931, Passfield appointed a police inspector and two Chinese women inspectors to help register Mui Tsai. = End of the Anti-Mui Tsai Movement = The Anti- Mui Tsai Society disbanded in the 1930s. British charitable groups took over its cause and successfully pushed Parliament to enact reforms. Since the conclusion of the Anti-Mui Tsai movement in the 1930s, the political power of the three parties: the colonial government, the Chinese elites (as previously represented by the Kuk), and Chinese Christians (including women) has changed greatly. In April 1938, the Legislative Council passed legislation making it mandatory to register all adopted girls with the secretary for Chinese affairs.  International involvement   Clara and Hugh Haslewood  In August 1919 Clara Haslewood and her husband Hugh, a retired Royal Navy lieutenant-commander moved to Hong Kong. In November of the same year, Haslewood wrote several letters criticizing the Mui Tsai system and her writings were published by four newspapers. The attention these letters gained led reactionary governor, Sir Reginald Stubbs to have the Admiralty transfer Haslewood's husband. After returning to Britain, Haslewood continued to oppose the Mui Tsai system by speaking out in the press and writing to members of Parliament. In 1930, Clara and Hughe Haslewood published their book Child Slavery in Hong Kong: The Mui tsai System in which the mui tsai system was likened to slavery. After the Mui Tsai system gained awareness internationally, the Anti-Slavery and Aborigines Protection Society, the Fabian Society, the International Woman Suffrage Alliance, and the League of Nations began pressuring the Colonial Office to put an end to the practice.  Female Domestic Service Bill  The Secretary of State of the Colonies, Winston Churchill supported the anti-Mui Tsai movement and in 1922, he pledged to the House of Commons that within a year the practice would be ended. In 1923, the Female Domestic Service Bill banning the importing and transferring of Mui Tsai was established by the Hong Kong Legislative Council under the British Parliament. In a letter published by the Manchester Guardian in 1929, Churchill was criticized for being unable to fully abolishing the Mui Tsai system. Later that year, the Female Domestic Service (Amendment) Ordinance was enacted requiring all Mui Tsai to be registered. However, the Mui Tsai system continued because girls were acquired as adopted daughters in order to circumvent the mandatory registration. This led to an Ordinance in 1938 which required all adopted girls to be registered as well. By preventing the trading of Mui Tsai and recording adoptions, as existing Mui Tsai grew old enough to marry, the system was expected to eventually come to an end.  1926 Slavery Convention  The Convention to Suppress the Slave Trade and Slavery known as the 1926 Slavery Convention is an international treaty formed under the League of Nations. The Convention was signed on September 25, 1926 and on March 9, 1927 it was entered into the League of Nations Treaty Series.League of Nations Treaty Series 1927 https://treaties.un.org/doc/Publication/UNTS/LON/Volume%2060/v60.pdf The treaty established articles and rules banning slave trade and slavery. Britain was a signatory of the Convention, bringing international attention to anti- Mui Tsai efforts.  Organizations  Po Leung Kuk organization emblem. Po Leung Kuk Po Leung Kuk, also known as the Society for the Protection of Women and Children, is an organization founded on November 8, 1878. In the past, the organization helped poor women and children, prevented kidnappings, and assisted in complex family and marriage issues. Currently, the organization aids the community and its members by providing various services and welfare coverage.  Chinese Christians in Hong Kong  The Anti-Mui Tsai movement in 1921 was the first time the Chinese Christians worked collectively to campaign for social change. The Anti-Mui Tsai Society consisted of members from churches, YMCA, YWCA, and labor unions. Their objective was the liberation of all mui tsai and the abolition of the system. The active role women took in the campaigns contributed greatly to the movement. Chinese Christian women utilized the Western presence of missionaries to gain access to international resources which ultimately created a sense of agency between the two. Through their participation in public debates regarding issues of family and women, a new view of Chinese culture and custom was produced.  Women‚Äôs Rights Advocates  = Mrs. Ma Huo Qingtang (Fok Hing Tong ) = In 1920 she became a founder of the Chinese YWCA (Young Women's Christian Association) of Hong Kong along with Fok Shui Yue, Katherine S.C. Woo (Woo Suzhen), and Mrs. So Pui Kau (Su Peiqiu). She served as director and managed the association throughout the early to mid-1900s. Records show that she recruited the most members and also raised the largest amount of donations during her time at the YWCA. Mrs. Ma's Christian faith allowed her to detach from old standards and values and challenge tradition through her involvement in the Anti-Mui Tsai movement. = Stella Benson and Gladys Forster = Stella Benson and Gladys Foster were women's rights activist who were a part of a women's club called the Helena May. The Helena May Institute, established by the wife of governor Sir Henry May, was opened on September 12, 1916. The organization was created to provide support and guidance for women in Hong Kong. While being active members in the Helena May, Benson and Forster campaigned against licensed prostitution and sexual slavery. They worked with the local League of Nations subcommittee which Forster chaired in December 1930. Together they conducted research and worked to spread awareness about the conditions endured by young girls who were being traded as slaves.  In popular culture  Silver Spoon, Sterling Shackles () is a 2012 Hong Kong television drama produced by Television Broadcasts Limited (TVB). It follows the story of a wealthy family in 1930s Hong Kong dealing with tensions as feminist activists are pushing for women's rights seeking to rid the idea that men are superior to women. In episode 23 of the drama, a press conference is held where people voice their opposing opinions about the Mui Tsai system.  Effects of Anti-Mui Tsai Society in other countries  Hong Kong In 1879, the Chief Justice of the Hong Kong Supreme Court wrote that the Mui Tsai system was no different from slavery. The British government still did not take any action. The reason being, they feared it would destabilize Hong Kong society. During the 80 years of the colony's history, no steps were taken to try to abolish. When the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), Hong Kong began forming Human Rights laws around human trafficking. However, the Mui Tsai seemed to be neglected under the law due to the cultural influence of what it means to be Mui Tsai. Often seen as charitable to be Mui Tsai, targeting the system similarly to other forms of human trafficking proved more complex and difficult. Thus, intervention relies more on the anti-Mui Tsai activists and other NGOs. With Hong Kong's anti-human trafficking laws still being discussed in 2018, where Mui Tsai comes in between the current human rights laws and modern slavery acts in Hong Kong remains not entirely clear. Britain The Mui Tsai system was a commonly occurring issue for Britain when the country had a wide spread empire in the Asiatic regions. In the 1920s human rights was becoming a topic of interest in Great Britain.Policies put in place by Winston Churchill, the Secretary of State for the Colonies, targeted social issues in British colonies. British news sources at the time kept mainland Britain updated on the status of Mui Tsai abolitionism in Hong Kong. Through these newspapers, the British public could identify Mui Tsai as a child slavery issue into the 1930s. Soon after, the public would pressure parliament for more higher human rights standards to be placed all around the British Empire. Mui Tsai was known to be active in the British Crown Colony in Hong Kong Anti- Mui Tsai still exercises activism in these regions after separation from the British Empire. In 1926, Britain became one of the signatories to the International Slavery Convention under the League of Nations. The Mui Tsai issue soon came under international scrutiny. Sino-British relations still discuss the state of human rights in China including human trafficking. However, government dialogue on the remaining Mui Tsai is sparse, and British Anti-Mui Tsai communities seem non existent. Other Settlements: Macau and Malaysia Macau initially saw the rise of the Mui Tsai system in the 16th century similarly to mainland China in impoverished situations. Anti-Mui Tsai activism rose after the intervention of the Mandarins. However, Anti-Mui Tsai Activism became more active in later years when targeting the still existing practices of Mui Tsai and human trafficking in mainland China. The spread of Mui Tsai to other parts of Asia and the world through Chinese diaspora aided in its abolition, and in raising the awareness of the wider issue of child welfare. Similarly to the Mui Tsai tradition in the Chinese countryside, the system took to poorer provinces that existed more in the 19th and 20th centuries. United States At the start 19th Century Sino-U.S. maritime relations began the immigration of Chinese people to America and the starting of Chinese American communities. Most early Chinese immigrants to the United States borrowed money from their relatives and used the bulk of their savings at home for their journey. Although some had communities to work and make money in, poverty was not at all uncommon in early Chinese American communities. This environment of poor and culture shocked Chinese immigrants made a breeding ground for the Mui tsai system. Interest and activism for human rights was not very evident at the time of the Mui Tsai system's American start, especially in immigrant communities. Human rights as a topic in America would not take off until the 1900s leaving Mui Tsai out of public common knowledge. These Immigrant communities had little to no access to education and political voice, hindering their ability to bring Mui Tsai and systematic slavery with in their communities into public eye if so desired. Also, activists within other areas, such as feminism, would struggle to understand and communicate with communities still practicing Mui Tsai into the 20th century. The overall cultural attitude within Mui Tsai practicing communities would isolate the issue from intervention. When both Christians and Protestants began targeting Mui Tsai in San Francisco, the issue of this kind of child slavery became more recognized by non-Chinese American communities. Into the late 1900s Chinese American communities and people gained better socioeconomic status, weakening the tradition as 2nd and 3rd generation Chinese Americans would not carry on the system and tradition. Today the Anti Mui Tsai Activism and human trafficking reaches the United States in international human rights discussion.  Current issues  Although the Mui Tsai question has been dealt with through legislation, some of the issues are still current. The courts frequently hear cases of cruelty to domestic helpers, punished by employers who still believe their maids belong to them. There are elderly women alive in Hong Kong who were sold into servitude as infants. While this was mostly done out of desperate poverty, deeply seated cultural prejudices against girls also played a key role. Despite the introduction of legal safeguards for women on the mainland in the 20s, and massive advance since, attitudes towards women in rural areas remain primitive. According to reports, rural midwives continue to drown female infants at birth on the instructions of mothers-in-law. Orphanages these days are also mostly filled with girls who one would have been sold as mui tsai. Case Reports An 11-year-old girl was admitted to Tuen Mun Hospital in April 2005 for evaluation of suspected child abuse. From the age of 8, she had been working in the home of her relatives to scrape a living for her family. At 10 years old, she was sent to Hong Kong to stay with her aunt on a visitor's visa. Her parents were able to receive money as financial relief. However, the aunt did not allow the child to telephone or go back home even after her visitor's visa expired. The child worked as a servant in the aunt's home. She was forced to sleep on the floor and had meals after everyone else was finished. The child had to prepare meals, wash dishes, do laundry, shop for food, clean furniture, and mop the floor. She was given no rest breaks and was subject to physical punishments. Punishments included kicking and beating with a slipper, pricking with a pair of pliers, and spanking with a rod. Despite her injuries, she was never given any medical attention. The child's repeated injuries soon attracted the attention of a supermarket staff and the staff finally decided to report the case to the police. This report bears a remarkable resemblance to that of a Mui Tsai. The girl was transferred from a poor family in Mainland China into Hong Kong for servitude following a financial transaction. However, this case was distinguished from previous accounts of Mui Tsai because there was a blood tie between the mistress and servant. Moreover, the child travelled to Hong Kong with valid documents. Therefore, the perpetrator was not charged. Although the Mui Tsai system is no longer accepted, many of the factors underlying its development such as poverty and son preference or discriminations against the female gender are still prevalent. With the return of authority over Hong Kong to the People's‚Äô Republic of China in 1997, there has been a closer economic link between the Special Administrative Region and the Mainland. Furthermore, traveling over the borders has been made easier. As a result, such changes may have facilitated the emergence of new forms of child victimization in Hong Kong. Child abuse crossing the Hong Kong-China border presents new challenges since offenses committed outside the Special Administrative Region are not under Hong Kong jurisdiction. Therefore, investigation of suspected abuse case is often incomplete or impossible. To make matters worse, children who are residents of the Mainland will be repatriated and there are no formal channels for the follow-up of the victims and their families. The social services provided by no -government organization in Mainland china offer a possible way for child protection agencies in Hong Kong to monitor the wellbeing of the victims, but the effectiveness of this kind of monitoring is still uncertain  See also  * Mui Tsai * Silver Spoon, Sterling Shackles  References  Category:Women's rights in China ","title":"Anti-Mui Tsai Activism"},{"id":"57905781","text":"\\"I've Had It\\" is a song written by Carl Bonura and Ray Ceroni and performed by The Bell Notes.

History and description  Luka Petrovich Skaramanga built a single-story house at 53 Petrovsky Street in the first half of the 19th century. In 1834, Skaramanga was a member of a local commission to improve the condition of the harbor and the related embankment. From 1873 to 1880 the house was owned by the merchant Ivan Amvrosiyevich Skaramanga, who owned a brick manufacturing company. In 1890 the house belonged to Ivan Skaramanga, who was married to Virginia Mikhaelovna. They had three daughters (Elizabeth, Maria and Virginia) and three sons (Ambrose, Mikhail and Panteleymon). The Skaramanga family's wealth grew, and they bought houses at 95 and 97 Grecheskaya Street, in Petrovsky Street, and at the Merchant exchange. Other documents suggest 53 Petrovsky Street could be related to the Greek office Skaramanga, Manusi which was closed in 1893. This business imported tea, coffee, citrus fruits and exported wheat, cake, and vegetable oils. In 1898 documents show the house was owned by Virginia, the widow of Ivan. In 1923 the house became an orphanage, which was demolished in the 21st century.

Florus and Laurus - is an Orthodox church in Pirogovo village, Sverdlovsk Oblast. The building was granted the status of regional significance on the 28th of December 2001 (the Sverdlovsk Oblast Government Decree ‚Ññ 859). The object number of cultural heritage of regional significance is 661710759330005.  History  The construction works started in 1832. The southern side-altar was consecrated in the name of St. Basil the Great on the 7th of February 1835. , the main church was consecrated in the name of the martyrs Florus and Laurus on the 7th of September 1841. In 1869 the construction of the northern side-altar was started. The side-altar was consecrated on the 25th of January 1871 in the name of Saint Nicholas. In 1937 the church was closed. It was returned to the Russian Orthodox Church only in 1991. The church has been undergoing restoration since 2003.  Architecture  The three-dimensional composition of the building is centric, in the form of a stepped pyramid. In the center of the cross shape of the church there is a two-light temple quadrangle. It is covered by four slopes with a curvilinear roof with lucarnes on the sides and a light lantern at the top. The sides of the quadrilateral are joined by rectangular forms. They are organized as branches of the cross shape construction: the eastern branch of the cross is intended for the main altar; the northern and southern branches of the cross are side-altars. The dimensional form of the western branch of the cross is higher than the others. It serves as the porch and the base for the bell tower. The cylindrical dimension of the bell tower is cut by four arches. It has a square base (pedestal) and is covered by a dome with a spire. The facade decoration of the church is simple. The walls of the altar and chapels are without decorative elements, only the tall windows and niches located above them are their surface. The planes of the temple quadrangle's facades are cut in the center by triple windows, at the corners they are fixed with pylons and completed vertically by a cornice plate on modillions. The forms of decorative details on the facades (modillions, archivolts) are simplified and distorted by handicraft execution. The type of the four-edged \\"cubed\\" roof by the lucarnes is borrowed from the architecture of temples of the Baroque period. The interior space of the temple is divided into separate rooms by triple arcades installed in the span of the girth arches. The cloistered vault in the center of the church and the cylindrical vaults in the neighboring rooms rest on the walls and Greek-cross plan form.

The name honors Ruth Cleveland, daughter of President Grover Cleveland. This mountain's name was officially adopted in 1952 by the United States Board on Geographic Names. Ruth Mountain is situated on the shared border of North Cascades National Park and the Mount Baker Wilderness, which is part of the Mount Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest. The summit offers views of Mount Shuksan, East Nooksack Glacier, Seahpo Peak, Nooksack Tower, Icy Peak, Mount Sefrit, Mineral Mountain, and the Picket Range. The melting and receding Ruth Glacier on the north slope of Ruth creates the headwaters for the Chilliwack River. Precipitation runoff also finds its way into the Nooksack and Baker Rivers. Climate Ruth Mountain is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America.Ruth and Shuksan Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach the North Cascades, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades. As a result, the west side of the North Cascades experiences high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer. Because of maritime influence, snow tends to be wet and heavy, resulting in high avalanche danger. The months July through September offer the most favorable weather for viewing or climbing this peak. Geology The North Cascades features some of the most rugged topography in the Cascade Range with craggy peaks, ridges, and deep glacial valleys. Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to the various climate differences. These climate differences lead to vegetation variety defining the ecoregions in this area. The history of the formation of the Cascade Mountains dates back millions of years ago to the late Eocene Epoch. With the North American Plate overriding the Pacific Plate, episodes of volcanic igneous activity persisted. In addition, small fragments of the oceanic and continental lithosphere called terranes created the North Cascades about 50 million years ago. During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured the landscape leaving deposits of rock debris. The ‚ÄúU‚Äù-shaped cross section of the river valleys are a result of recent glaciation. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the North Cascades area.

He is best known for portraying Captain Gabi Ayub in the political thriller television series Fauda.  Early life  Itzik Cohen was born in Tel Aviv, Israel, to a Jewish family. His parents are Naomi (Ezra), a housewife, and Meir Cohen, an electrician. In 1976, at the age of 8, he moved with his family to Jaffa where he lived for the remainder of his childhood. After serving in the Israel Defense Forces, he received his BA with honors in 1993 from the Department of Theater at Tel Aviv University. In 1996, together with a few of his classmates, he founded the drag band The Daughters of Pesia. The band helped bring drag into the Israeli mainstream, making appearances in the Uri Pasteur-directed musical All is Legend (alongside Michal Yannai), and the educational television program Return of the Sheriff.  Acting career   Theater  From 1993-1994, as a member of the Atim Ensemble, Cohen played the priest in Romeo and Juliet, adapted and directed by Rina Yerushalmi.

It is situated in North Cascades National Park at the head of Nooksack Cirque. High ridges connect it to Seahpo Peak and Mount Shuksan. An icefall occupies the northeast cirque, and small glaciers clad all sides of the peak. Precipitation runoff drains into the Nooksack and Baker Rivers. Climate Icy Peak is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach the North Cascades, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades (Orographic lift). As a result, the west side of the North Cascades experiences high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer. Because of maritime influence, snow tends to be wet and heavy, resulting in high avalanche danger. The months July through September offer the most favorable weather for viewing or climbing this peak. Geology The North Cascades features some of the most rugged topography in the Cascade Range with craggy peaks, ridges, and deep glacial valleys. Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to the various climate differences. These climate differences lead to vegetation variety defining the ecoregions in this area. The history of the formation of the Cascade Mountains dates back millions of years ago to the late Eocene Epoch. With the North American Plate overriding the Pacific Plate, episodes of volcanic igneous activity persisted. In addition, small fragments of the oceanic and continental lithosphere called terranes created the North Cascades about 50 million years ago. During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured the landscape leaving deposits of rock debris. The \\"U\\"-shaped cross section of the river valleys are a result of recent glaciation. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the North Cascades area.
