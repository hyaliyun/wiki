Rizal Alih, a patrolman, and several other men had been detained pending an investigation into their alleged involvement in the murder of Zamboanga City Mayor Cesar Climaco on 14 November 1984. Gen. Eduardo Batalla, the regional commander of the PC-INP who had his office at the camp, had made a decision to have the detained men transferred to Manila; however, Alih refused to cooperate. Batalla had summoned the men to his office for a conference, but the talks degenerated into a heated exchange with both parties shouting at each other. Alih and his companions were able to over-power their guards and took Batalla, his aide Col. Romeo Abendan and several others hostage. After a 3-day siege, Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces of the Philippines Renato de Villa ordered that the camp be assaulted. Philippine security forces decided to attack the camp using helicopters. Rockets deployed from the aircraft set fire to the building where Gen. Batalla was being held and it burned to the ground. Batalla, Abendan and 18 other PC/INP personnel were later found burned to death. Alih managed to escape the ruined camp, making his way to Basilan and eventually Sabah, Malaysia. Alih was arrested by Malaysian authorities on August 18, 1994 and charged with illegal possession of firearms. He was extradited back to the Philippines in 2006. He was detained in Camp Crame and died in the camp's hospital on 14 August 2015 after complaining of chest pains. He was buried the next day in Zamboanga City. ==Commemoration== The Philippine National Police commemorates the deaths of Gen. Batalla and Col. Abendan every year. Camp Cawa-Cawa itself was renamed Camp Brigadier General Eduardo B Batalla, and another Philippine National Police camp in Mercedes, Zamboanga City was named Camp Colonel Romeo A. Abendan in honor of the slain police officers. ==In popular culture== A film depicting the siege, Arrest: Pat. Rizal Alih ‚Äì Zamboanga Massacre, was released on March 8, 1989. Directed by Carlo J. Caparas, it stars Ramon Revilla as Rizal Alih and Eddie Garcia as Brig. Gen.

The fortification on the Katzenberg hill was built around 300 AD after the Roman limes had been overrun and Germanic tribes had invaded and plundered the Roman Empire (the so-called Limesfall). The inhabitants of the Roman vicus, which was located on the site of the present-day town of Mayen, could escape to the fort in time of danger. At that time, town walls were built around the provincial capitals of Trier, Cologne and Mainz, as well as around smaller places like Koblenz or Andernach. The Katzenberg was the largest of about 60 Late Roman hillforts which were constructed in the Eifel and Hunsr√ºck regions. They were used for about 70 years and then, after a 30-year pause, used again, in some cases until about 450 AD. On the uppermost crest of the hill is a small military outpost, the lower-lying open areas were probably used by the civilian population in the event of a threat. The fort covered an area of 1.2 hectares. The remains of the Late Roman hillfort were discovered around 1900 and excavated for the first time between 1907 and 1932. After a long pause, excavations were re-started in 1997 as part of the Volcano Park project. The finds were archaeologically investigated in Koblenz and the town of Mayen under the direction of the state office for cultural heritage. For the history of handicrafts the roofing finds were especially important. The roof slates found in the round towers were, surprisingly, shaped like scales, something which was rare in Roman times. In 2000, parts of the defensive wall and two round towers were reconstructed on original foundations of the walls. On the remains of the old military station on the hilltop, which had underfloor heating in the form of a hypocaust, a protective structure was built. All roofs were covered in slates in the form of scales and hexagons (for protection). == Literature == * Angelika Hunold: Die Befestigung auf dem Katzenberg bei Mayen und die sp√§tr√∂mischen H√∂henbefestungen in Nordgallien.

Sculptor Malvina Hoffman used him as her model for part of The Races of Mankind exhibit at the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago. Sargent was the younger brother of Duke Kahanamoku. ==Family background== He was the youngest son born into a family of Native Hawaiians headed by Duke Halapu Kahanamoku and Julia Pa ªakonia Lonokahikina Paoa. Both parents were direct descendants of Kamehameha I. His brothers were Duke, Samuel, David, William and Louis, all of whom participated in competitive aquatic sports. His sisters were Bernice, Kapiolani and Maria. ==Athletics== In 1925, at age 15 years, he won the backstroke event to help his 7th Grade classmates win a YMCA meet in Honolulu. At age 20, when he attended Andover Academy in Massachusetts, he won a 50-yard freestyle competition against a Yale University competitor. Sargent was part of a crew for the July 22, 1933 canoe races off the Kona coast. Five days later, he and his friend Paul Fagan Jr. became stranded off the shore 3-1/2 miles from Diamond Head when Fagan's speed boat ran out of fuel. With no radio or other equipment aboard to help them, and no other boaters within signaling range, they began to drift out to sea. In a self-rescue reported on the front page of the Honolulu Star-Bulletin, with no rescue in sight, Sargent spent four hours towing the boat back to shore with one hand, while he used his feet and other hand to paddle through the water.; He and his brother Sam, along with Fred Wilhelm and Melvin Paoa, paddling for the Outrigger Canoe Club, won in the Junior 4 on June 11, 1937. Through the next decade, Sargent continued to compete in local aquatic meets in Hawaii. During the August 15, 1946 holiday celebrating the prior year's surrender of Japan (known then as alternately \\"Victory Over Japan Day\\" or \\"Veterans Day\\"), Sargent steered his crew of the \\"Kakina\\" outrigger to victory. Circa 1939-1940, Sargent took up the game of golf. As he got older, his golf activities began to replace the more vigorous competitive aquatic sports. ==Business and personal life== In 1931, sculptor Malvina Hoffman used Sargent as her model for \\"Hawaiian Surf-Rider, Polynesia\\", part of The Races of Mankind exhibit at the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago. The exhibit eventually went into storage, but was revived at the Field Museum in 2016.; He went to work for Standard Oil as its Hawaiian public relations representative, a position he held for 38 years. When President Franklin D. Roosevelt visited Hawaii in July 1934, Sargent and his brother Sam were part of the official welcoming ceremonies at the Royal Hawaiian Hotel. ; Sargent married school teacher Anna Furtado. She was elected to the Territorial House of Representatives, and to the State Senate after statehood was granted. The couple were King and Queen of Aloha Week in 1961. Sargent was appointed chairman of the Hawaiian Heart Fund in 1963. Anna died in 1969, and Sargent ran unsuccessfully for the State Senate on the Republican ticket. He married Catherine Toberman Torrence in 1970. Her father was famous Los Angeles developer Charles E. Toberman, known as ‚ÄúMr. Hollywood‚Äù after building landmarks such as the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel, Grauman's Chinese Theatre and Hollywood Bowl. She died in 1980.

Sam√† lived alone with her mother until 1920 aiding her in domestic duties while coping with their poor state due to her father's death before Sam√† was born. But drinking unsafe water after working in the fields caused great infirmities and often-violent convulsions that the populace believed her to be possessed. In the town lived a baroness who organized for her to be taken to a Carthusian convent to be exorcised but this failed. Sam√† was healed after the convent's prior put her in front of a statue of Saint Bruno of Cologne and lived in relative peace for a while before being bedridden with another illness that she never recovered from. Her mother tended to her until her death in 1920 at which point the populace as well as nuns and Redemptorist priests came to visit her to aid her and provide for her while also seeking her out for advice. Sam√† was close to the Sisters of the Sacred Heart who placed a black veil upon her head as if she were a nun too. The beatification process had been called for since her death since the population came to believe she was a saint due to her reputation for personal holiness. The calls for such a process grew in the 2000s to the point where the formal cause was launched in her province. The process culminated on 18 December 2017 after Pope Francis confirmed her heroic virtue and named her as Venerable as a result. The pope also approved a decree confirming a miracle attributed to her in mid-2020; her beatification therefore can take place sometime in 2021 in Catanzaro. ==Life== ===Childhood=== Mariantonia Sam√† was born on 2 March 1875 as the sole child born to Bruno Sam√† (d. 20.06.1874) and Marianna Vivino (d. 24.02.1920). Her father had died a few months prior to her birth which left her mother alone to take care of the newborn child. The pair were poor and lived in a small home in a small lane almost five feet wide with dim light. Her baptism was celebrated on 3 March in the local parish. Her paternal grandmother was Antonia Frustaci and her maternal great-uncle was Antonio Vivino (09.10.1824-???). Her maternal grandparents were Giuseppe Vivino and Caterina Carioti. Sam√† made her First Communion and received her Confirmation in 1882. The pair fostered a close bond with each other due to the pair living alone and her mother did all she could to provide for herself and her daughter despite their hardships. Sam√† was docile and obedient to her mother. The two were also illiterate and spoke the local dialect rather than the mainstream Italian language. The pair were also pious and walked barefoot in summer and winter to attend Mass at their church; their clothing was also poor and was minimal more so in wintertime. Sam√† often accompanied a mule loaded with wheat to the mill and would bring it back to the village with sacks of flour which would be exchanged for a loaf of bread each week. ===Hardship=== In 1886 she followed her mother and some relatives to the Saluro River to clean clothing near the mill along the banks. En route home she was in a section of land known as Briga and there decided to quench her thirst so bent to drink from a water puddle she thought was clean (but in all likelihood was contaminated). But when she reached hope she shrunk up and was immobile for about a month. During this period she often babbled incoherent things and often shook and twisted around. It was also strange in the mind of those who knew her condition that she ate past midnight and at no other time. But soon people came to believe that evil spirits had possessed her and so turned to God for a miracle. These attempts failed until the baroness Enrichetta Scoppa decided to intervene in 1894. The baroness organized for the immobile Sam√† to be taken to a Carthusian convent (that of Serra San Bruno) for an exorcism. The convent's archives revealed a monk's 15 paged narrative dated 1904 and detailing the baroness's plans. In June 1894 she was transported eight hours alongside her mother to the carrier but sealed in a wooden box with four people as her carriers. Sam√† was enclosed in the wooden box due to her often-violent convulsions. Her transporters were Antonio Mannello and Antonio Frustaci as well as the brothers Vincenzo and Giuseppe Lombardo (who all worked for the baroness). During the trip the box was opened to see if she required something but she declined and grew more and more agitated over time. Their arrival at the convent was before noon with some of the locals following the procession to the convent where the exorcism rite began in Latin once the procession reached the convent's main gate. The absent convent's prior - who had been elsewhere - joined the crowd and the other monks for five hours turning to God for His grace but nothing happened. To that end the prior ordered a servant to get a silver bust containing the cranium and bones of Saint Bruno of Cologne. Once Sam√† saw this bust - which she believed was smiling at her - got up and hugged the bust proclaiming her condition to be healed. The crowd were elated that Sam√†'s condition was resolved so the box and her old clothes were burned to the side of the convent to demonstrate a rebirth and renewal. ===The Little Sister of Saint Bruno=== Sam√† returned home but in 1896 suffered from arthritis. The condition grew so bad to the point where she confined herself to her bed on her back with her bent knees raised. This would be the position she would remain in for the remainder of her life. Sam√† was immobile once more but could use her hands to recite rosaries and to eat. Her mother died in 1920 which left her alone until an older woman oversaw her care for a time. But the townsfolk visited her to help care for her. People bought her food and cooked meals as well as oils and fruits to sustain her without causing her pain and intestinal complications. But she was far too modest for the doctor to assess those areas that caused her greater pain and forbade the doctor from doing so. Those supplies she needed she kept for herself but donated the rest of the food supplies to the poor and said of it that \\"God will take care of me tomorrow!\\" There were those who offered financial assistance but she refused all attempts at this. The wall opposite her had a large Crucifix and she would often stare at it and refer to Jesus as \\"that beautiful Jesus\\" as the best description possible for Him. The local priest would bring the Eucharist to her each morning as well as each noon and night at her request for she believed it bought her closer to Jesus. People who visited her often recited rosaries with her in Latin and countless others came to see her to ask her for advise. Her response would be to urge courage and hope. The Sisters of the Sacred Heart - whom the baroness Scoppa had allowed to settle in her vacant palace - made her a \\"sister\\" and had a special reverence and love for her. To that end the order covered her head with the order's black veil and she became known as the \\"Little Sister of Saint Bruno\\". The nuns too took care of her and helped to both comb and bathe her. The local parish priest and the Redemptorist fathers also visited her and oversaw her spiritual care and guidance. In 1915 she dedicated herself to God through private vows with the permission of the parish priest. ===Death and burial=== Sam√† died in the morning on 27 May 1953 while three women were at her bedside reciting litanies to the Blessed Mother; her gaze upon her death was at the Crucifix on the opposite wall and her last words were the names of Jesus and His mother. Upon her death she had no visible bedsores and her skin was both smooth and unblemished. Her remains were dressed in a white linen dress and carried in a procession through the streets in an open casket before their interment following her funeral on 29 May. Upon her death the parish priest wrote in the margins of her death certificate that Sam√† had \\"died in the concept of holiness\\". On 3 August 2003 her remains were relocated from the chapel of the Sisters of the Sacred Heart to a new special tomb constructed in the church of Santi Pietro e Paolo. ==Beatification== The Calabrian episcopate voiced their approval in launching the cause for the canonization for Sam√† after a favorable vote was taken on 20 April 2007. The diocesan investigation opened in the Catanzaro-Squillace archdiocese on 5 August 2007 and later concluded on 2 March 2009. But the formal introduction to the cause came under Pope Benedict XVI on 29 September 2007 after she was titled as a Servant of God and the Congregation for the Causes of Saints issued an edict declaring \\"nihil obstat\\" (no objections to the cause). But the C.C.S. requested that another investigation into Sam√†'s life be undertaken and the process was opened on 20 October 2011 and was closed a couple of months later on 31 January 2012. The C.C.S. later validated these two processes in Rome on 9 June 2012. The postulation drafted and later submitted the Positio dossier to the C.C.S. officials on 15 September 2014 for evaluation with nine theologians approving the cause on 21 June 2016 after having assessed the dossier. The cardinal and bishop members of the C.C.S. approved the cause later on 5 December 2017. Sam√† became titled as Venerable on 18 December 2017 after Pope Francis confirmed that she had lived a model life of heroic virtue. Her beatification depends upon one miracle receiving papal approval; the miracle needs to be a healing that both science and medicine fail to explain. There was one such case reported in Genoa which led to Cardinal Angelo Bagnasco overseeing a diocesan investigation into the case from 1 November 2008 until 23 October 2009. Medical experts approved this miracle in December 2019 as did theologians in the months following in addition to the C.C.S. members. Pope Francis signed a decree on 10 July 2020 confirming this healing as a miracle therefore enabling for Sam√† to be beatified in Catanzaro sometime in 2021. The current postulator for the cause is the Capuchin friar Carlo Calloni. ==References== ==External links== * Hagiography Circle * Geni * Decree on heroic virtues * Positio Category:1875 births Category:1953 deaths Category:19th-century Italian people Category:19th-century Roman Catholics Category:19th-century venerated Christians Category:20th-century Italian people Category:20th-century Roman Catholics Category:20th-century venerated Christians Category:Beatifications by Pope Francis Category:Italian Roman Catholics Category:People from the Province of Catanzaro Category:Venerated Catholics by Pope Francis ","title":"Mariantonia Sam√†"},{"id":"56576292","text":"Nepeta teydea is a species of flowering plant in the family Lamiaceae, native to the Canary Islands.

The film revolves around how the lives of K. Krishna Kumar (Jayaram) and his wife Nirmala (Anusree) go for a toss after lord almighty enters their house. This film is credited as 500th film appearance of Nedumudi Venu. ==Plot== The movie begins with the narration that God (Nedumudi Venu) is planning to visit earth in order to study the humans closely and has sent his personal secretary Mayadathan (Pradeep Kottayam) to enquire about a suitable house for him to stay in. They choose the home of K. Kumar/ Krishna Kumar (Jayaram) to stay for the duration of their visit, as he is the only person on earth who has never troubled god by praying for his needs. God and Mayadathan arrive in Kerala and arrives at K Kumar's house. They are welcomed by the entire village and starts living at Krishna Kumar's house. Next morning they see how life is for Krishna Kumar and his wife Nirmala ( Anusree). Kumar is the Panchayath Secretary and spends his time wandering around, while Nirmala spends all her time toiling in the kitchen and doing the household works. Also, Krishna Kumar is a loafer who needs his wife to do everything for him and yet doesn't appreciate it and often finds fault with her. This leads to constant bickering among the couple. During one such fight, Nirmala and Krishna Kumar challenge each other to exchange their roles to prove whether men or women are stronger. God tries to dissuade them from this attempt and warns them that there would be dire consequences to this game. But both Nirmala and Krishna Kumar are adamant. So God allows them to do as they want. From the next day, Nirmala goes to work and Krishna Kumar stays at home to do the household works that Nirmala used to do for him. While life is easy for Nirmala, Kumar struggles to cope with the stress of having to manage the home and Kitchen. On a parallel track, the life of Nirmala's cousin Karimannur Gopi ( Salim Kumar) is shown. He lives with his wife, who is very lazy and doesn't want to cook, and his son. He is supposedly a friend of Lionel Messi and has opened a jewellery store in partnership with him. In Kumar's house, after many days into the role swapping, Nirmala and Krishna Kumar decides to end it (as Nirmala is unable to bear how much Krishna Kumar is suffering) and tells the same to God. But God drops the bombshell by saying that it is impossible to switch the roles back now because to experience the life of a woman completely, Krishna Kumar's will have to get pregnant and give birth to a child. This shatters the couple. The couple tries many attempts to outsmart god's plans by adopting different methods to try to abort the child Kumar is carrying but fails each time. Then the villagers come to know that Krishna Kumar is pregnant and therefore media takes up the issue and together they criticises Krishna Kumar for his pregnancy and all this makes him attempt suicide. Then he wakes up hearing knocks on the door to find Gopi who tell him that Nirmala gave birth to a boy. It was then he realised that all he saw was just a dream. ==Cast== *Jayaram as Krishna Kumar *Anusree as Nirmala *Salim Kumar as Karimannur Gopi *Sreenivasan as Doctor *Nedumudi Venu as God *Harisree Ashokan as Doctor *Anjali Nair as Gopi's Wife *Kulappulli Leela as Narayani Eadathi *Prayaga Martin *Pradeep Kottayam as Maydathan, God's Personal Secretary *Ramesh Pisharody as TV news reader *Kochu Preman *Surabhi Lakshmi as Betty *Shivaji Guruvayoor *Indrans *Nadirshah (Cameo Appearance in song) *P.C.

Carter. It is the first part of Carter's Elm Harbor series; two more novels in the series were published in 2007 and 2008. The book was Carter's first work of fiction, and spent 11 weeks on The New York Times best- seller list following its publication. Described as a murder mystery, the novel tells the story of Talcott Garland, a law professor who uncovers a mystery surrounding his father, the titular 'Emperor of Ocean Park'. Written from Tal's first person perspective, the book explores themes of privileged black identity, politics, and law, and contains many allusions to chess. Because a number of publishing houses were interested in obtaining the rights to the book, Carter received an exceptionally large advance of $4.2 million. The size of the advance, for a debut novel from an African-American writer, contributed to an important shift for African-American literature, with the book marketed and received as a mainstream work of fiction, rather than one aimed at a specialized audience. The novel was well-reviewed by most critics, with attention being drawn to its then-unusual setting for a murder mystery story, featuring an African-American protagonist and with most of the story taking place in wealthy, predominately African-American neighborhoods in Washington, D.C. and Martha's Vineyard. It won the 2003 Anisfield-Wolf Book Award and BCALA Literary Award, and was nominated for several more, including the NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Literary Work, Fiction and the New Blood Dagger from the Crime Writer's Association. ==Plot== Talcott 'Tal' Garland (known as Misha to his closest friends) is a black tenured law professor at Yale University, in New Haven, Connecticut. His wife, Kimberley Madison, known as Kimmer, is an attorney. Tal's father, Oliver Garland, a federal judge, has just died. Years earlier, Judge Oliver Garland had to decline a nomination from President Ronald Reagan for a seat on the Supreme Court due to the release of embarrassing information about his past, and then resigned from the bench. Following some years of heavy drinking, Oliver in his later life became a well-paid mascot for right-wing political groups. Judge Garland dies in suspicious circumstances, purportedly of a heart attack. The death brings together the Judge's three living children ‚Äì Tal, Addison, and Mariah ‚Äì for the funeral. A fourth child, Abby, died some years previously, in a hit and run car accident. Talcott is named in Judge Garland's will as being responsible for the \\"final arrangements\\", which are not explained. Talcott's only clue is an obtuse note from his father telling him to search for \\"Angela's boyfriend\\", someone unknown to Talcott who apparently holds information that the Judge wants Talcott to have, and ending \\"Excelsior, my son! Excelsior! It begins!\\" ‚Äì a reference to the Double Excelsior; the first of many chess references found within the trail of clues the Judge has left. Unbeknownst to Tal, the Judge had hired a private investigator to investigate his daughter's death. The investigator had been recommended by Jack Ziegler, one of his college roommates who later worked in espionage for the CIA, and in return, the Judge influenced some legislation to suit Ziegler. The investigator finds the car that killed Abby was driven by the son of a prominent US senator and his girlfriend, both of whom were subsequently killed in similar car accidents; it is later revealed at least one of these \\"accidents\\" was caused by the private investigator. The release of details of Judge Garland's relationship with Ziegler is what resulted in the Judge failing to gain a seat on the Supreme Court. Ziegler approaches Talcott at his father's funeral, demanding to know the details of the Judge's final arrangements. Two other interlinking plot threads feature Kimmer's campaigning for a highly sought after seat on one of the thirteen Federal Courts of Appeal, and the often-parlous state of Talcott and Kimmer's marriage. Kimmer, with whom Talcott first had an affair while she was married to one of Talcott's fellow law professors, is suggested as being unfaithful, although this is never confirmed. Talcott discovers that parties including the FBI and an unknown assassin ‚Äì later revealed as one of Judge Garland's fellow judges ‚Äì are prepared to kill in order to obtain the details of the arrangements. Talcott follows a series of cryptic clues left by his father, including working out that \\"Angela's boyfriend\\" referred to his Uncle Derek, a communist and admirer of Angela Davis. Talcott finally learns that \\"the arrangement\\" to which the Judge referred was a floppy disk containing details of the many trials and legal decisions which the Judge illegally fixed in return for favors and payment from prominent people. The disk was hidden in a toy bear which belonged to Abby ‚Äì Tal's deceased sister. The book ends with Talcott throwing the disk into a fire to start with a clean slate. ==Development history== Author Stephen L. Carter in 2015 Stephen L. Carter wrote The Emperor of Ocean Park while working as a Professor of Law at Yale. In a 2002 interview, Carter, who had already written several non-fiction books in his career, said that the idea for a fiction novel had \\"always been in the back of [his] mind\\", and that the major characters of the novel had been ones he had tried to fit into various drafts and unpublished stories over the preceding years. Carter started working on the book in the mid-1990s, writing mostly at night while working at Yale during the day; it took him four years to complete in draft. He originally created an outline for the novel because that was how he wrote his scholarly arguments in non-fiction pieces, but soon found the outline restrictive as the story's content changed dramatically and discarded it. At one point, the draft manuscript grew to 1,300 pages long. In December 2000, Carter and his wife decided that he should focus all his time on finishing the final version. He spent six weeks \\"polishing the draft into shape\\". Many of the legal and political topics addressed in the book, such as the workings of the FBI, the appointment process for the Supreme Court, and the political lobbying of judges were topics on which Carter had previously published non-fiction books and writings, making it possible for him to use this knowledge in writing the novel without requiring extensive research. In particular, his scholarly works The Confirmation Mess, The Culture of Disbelief, Civility, and Reflections of an Affirmative Action Baby were all touchpoints in writing The Emperor of Ocean Park. Carter said his fiction writing was influenced by Go Tell It on the Mountain author James Baldwin and Langston Hughes, in particular how Hughes wrote dialogue. A fierce bidding war for publication and adaptation rights ensued in early 2001 among American publishers Knopf, sister publisher Random House, and others. Carter was given $4.2 million, one of the largest advances ever received by a first-time author of fiction from Knopf for the rights to publish a book. The advance included the rights to Carter's second novel, New England White, which was published in 2008. With Knopf and Random House making bids of equal value, Carter chose Knopf because he remembered the support he had been given from Knopf's editor- in chief, Sonny Mehta, who had read a few early draft chapters of the novel in 1998 and encouraged Carter to keep working on it. Carter received a further $1 million from Jonathan Cape for the British publishing rights. The size of the advance was discussed widely. At the time of the novel's publication, The Economist described it as a \\"reckless gamble\\" by Knopf, noting Carter had never written a work of fiction before. Writing for Newsweek, David Gates was also critical of the advance, which he suggested was \\"a way to make a Denzel Washington movie out of it\\", or that Knopf saw Carter as a black Tom Wolfe. Discussing the reviews in a piece for The Weekly Standard, Arnold Beichman said that much of the criticism of the book was because of the large advance Carter received for his debut novel. ===Publication history=== The Emperor of Ocean Park was first released in hardcover on June 2, 2002, published in the United States by Knopf. The paperback was released in the US on May 27, 2003. In 2002, it became the first book featured on the Today Shows book club, where it was selected by writer John Grisham, who is known for his own legal mysteries. It was featured on the cover of The New York Times Book Review on June 16. The interest generated by a national print and television advertising campaign plus a twelve-city promotional tour, along with positive reviews and media attention, led Knopf to claim to have been required to print an additional 250,000 hardcover copies within the first month of the book's release to meet demand beyond the initial print run of 275,000. The Observer reported that this claim was an exaggeration on the publisher's part to drum up additional publicity, and the actual print run in total was around 300,000 copies, with the total sales in hardcover being around 350,000 copies. The Emperor of Ocean Park immediately went to number one on Amazon.com and spent 11 weeks on the New York Times best-seller list. Carter said that \\"the enthusiasm and even affection that has greeted the novel and the characters has overwhelmed me\\". An audiobook version, narrated by Richard Allen, was released on July 21, 2003. The Emperor of Ocean Park forms part one of Carter's Elm Harbor series; the second book (New England White) was released in 2007, and the third (Palace Council) in 2008. Neither New England White nor Palace Council feature Talcott Garland as a character: New England White promotes two minor characters from The Emperor of Ocean Park ‚Äì Lemaster and Julia Carlyle ‚Äì to the main protagonists, and Palace Council is set from 1952‚Äì1974, with the main character, Eddie Wesley, being related to the Garland family by marriage. ==Major themes== The Emperor of Ocean Park was noted by many critics to bring together two themes ‚Äì the \\"lowbrow\\" genre fiction style, in particular using the principles and thematic elements of a pulp thriller or murder mystery, and the \\"highbrow\\" literary fiction style, in which Carter reflects on black America ‚Äì what Carter (as Talcott Garland) refers to as the \\"darker nation\\" ‚Äì from a black perspective. Ocean Park is an area of Oak Bluffs, a summer colony on Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts. Until the 1960s, Oak Bluffs was the only town on Martha's Vineyard that welcomed black tourists, as other towns on the island did not allow black guests to stay in inns and hotels. Carter summers there, and noted the enduring appeal of Martha's Vineyard to middle and upper-class African-American families. Racial themes and expository sections on upper-class black culture form a large part of the narrative of The Emperor of Ocean Park, with the lead character being described as highly self-conscious of his race and how that influences his life. Carter said in an online interview with MSNBC that he was \\"quite aware that very little in literature or in the media ever focuses on middle class and upper middle class Black Americans. If the success of this book means that publishers or film makers will be more interested in this class, that‚Äôs a good thing. On the other hand, I wouldn‚Äôt want the book‚Äôs focus on that group to mean we should stop thinking about those who are being left behind.\\" Parallels were drawn between Carter's work and that of Lawrence Otis Graham, who explored the lives of upper-class black Americans in his social commentaries. Professor Ben Barton of the California Law Review said the novel was \\"unmistakably a product by a legal academic\\"; Carter delves into great detail around a number of legal issues throughout the novel, calling upon his legal experience and research. Judge Oliver Garland is described as an amalgam of Robert Bork and Clarence Thomas; Carter noted that he was inspired to write about Judge Garland's travails during his confirmation hearing by his having watched the hearings of Clarence Thomas. Carter wanted to ensure that his character's lives were fully rounded and, particularly as a Christian, he wanted the novel to reflect that many of his characters had religious beliefs. In one interview, he drew a comparison between those beliefs and the seemingly strictly secular world of the modern college campus. The introductory epigraph (\\"Two fools always win, but three fools, never!\\") at the start of the book is a quote attributed by Carter to Siegbert Tarrasch, a chess writer of the late 19th and early 20th century. Chess plays a major part in The Emperor of Ocean Park; a member of the United States Chess Federation, Carter included a great number of allegories to chess within the novel, equating white characters with the white pieces, and black characters with the black. Early in the book, two pawns ‚Äì one white, one black ‚Äì go missing from the chessboard in Tal's father's study. The book is divided into three main sections, each named after an element of chess theory, again as allegories to the themes within the book; Nowotny Interference, in which two black pieces obstruct one another; Turton Doubling, when one white piece withdraws to enable a second white piece to move in front of it and jointly attack the black king; and Unprovided Flight, where only one move is available to the black king, and checkmate is imminent. The final chapter is entitled \\"Double Excelsior\\", in reference to the Excelsior problem, linking back to the Judge's original note for Talcott, and suggesting the one remaining black pawn (Tal) and the last white pawn (Ziegler) had been slowly moving toward one another, to be promoted to knights, with the only apparent ending being for the two pieces to collude (known as a \\"helpmate\\"), and the only possible result being that the black side must lose. In a lengthy author's note at the end of the novel, Carter says that the book was decidedly not a roman √† clef. While superficially, Stephen Carter and Talcott Garland shared a number of characteristics ‚Äì they were both middle-aged professors of law at Yale, both summered at Martha's Vineyard as part of the wealthy black community there, both were chess fans, both were married to other lawyers, and so on ‚Äì Carter considered that the resemblance ended there. He says that Garland is an original literary creation, as are all the other characters. This was gently mocked by some critics. Political scientist Michael Nelson said the \\"similarities between creator and creature are just too numerous and important to ignore\\". Carter acknowledged the author's note was \\"absurdly long\\", justifying it a reaction to not being able to put footnotes throughout the book, unlike in his non- fiction writing. Instead, he appended them to the end of the novel, saying \\"I don‚Äôt think I could have written a novel, as a scholar, without making sure I got my facts right and making sure the reader knew.\\" ==Literary significance and reception== The Ocean Park gazebo in Oak Bluffs. In an early review, Publishers Weekly forecast that The Emperor of Ocean Park would bring Carter wide recognition as a novelist. The novel received a broadly positive reception upon release, although some responses were mixed. In a review for the New York Times, writer Ward Just discussed at length the preoccupation of the book with describing the world of the black bourgeoisie, and suggested that \\"in Stephen Carter, the black upper class has found its Dreiser\\" ‚Äì referring to the influential naturalist author Theodore Dreiser. It was described as an \\"expansively, constantly interesting book\\" by The Detroit Free Press, which suggested it would be popular summer reading material. Like others, Jelani Cobb of The Crisis noted that the book features aspects of both genre and literary fiction, describing Carter's attempt to bring the two together as sprawling and sublime. He drew attention to the unusual protagonist, describing the Talcott Garland character as \\"jaded, overweight, and profoundly insecure\\". Historian Elizabeth Fox-Genovese considered the book to be \\"gripping\\", and noted that Carter had over a decade of experience in writing non-fiction about politics, law, and religion. She suggested that he may have used fiction to allow him more freedom to explore these topics, away from the didactic requirements of non-fiction. In an episode of the Newsnight Review for the BBC, novelist Ian Rankin said he thought the book was \\"very well written but badly constructed\\" due to the conflation of a number of thriller cliches, and that the over-complicated plot obscured a great story. The A.V. Club suggested Carter had a tendency to overwrite, and too often strayed away from a \\"spellbinding\\" plot in the novel's exposition. Carter's writing style was noted for being at times dispassionate, and 'chilly', particularly when straying away from the more esoteric topics the novel covers and into the personal, with criticism of some descriptions (such as of a young child being \\"childlike\\"). The density of the book was discussed, with some reviewers suggesting that the multitude of references to chess required a certain knowledge of the game in order to appreciate the allusions and clues contained through the book. Others said that the writing was at times clunky, and the extensive social commentary detracted from the narrative flow. In a negative review for the London Review of Books, critic Lorin Stein described the book as \\"long-winded [and] shoddily put together\\", and discussed why many American reviewers paid deference to what he thought was a high-toned airport novel. Stein found various inconsistencies within the book to be distracting, noting an example where a pool table appears mid-scene in a room previously described as \\"tiny\\", and said the plot was goofy and implausible. The publication of The Emperor of Ocean Park was described as part of a major shift for African-American literature. Instead of being marketed as a niche novel, the record-breaking advance, the publicity around its release, and the jacket art placed it firmly in the mainstream, as a \\"blockbusting, best- selling legal thriller\\". It was noted by John Kevin Young, though, that despite the marketing for the novel being \\"color-blind\\", the reviews and press attention to the book still drew attention to the race of the author and the characters within the novel, suggesting that the world of wealthy African Americans had been previously \\"hidden\\" to the white reader. While such commentary was outside of Knopf's control, it reinforced the pattern of how the mainstream media responded to African-American literature. ==Awards and nominations== Awards: *2003 Anisfield-Wolf Book Award (Fiction) *2003 BCALA Literary Award, from the Black Caucus of the American Library Association Nominations: *2002 NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Literary Work, Fiction *2002 CWA New Blood Dagger *2002 Los Angeles Times Book Prize, Mystery/thriller category *2004 International Dublin Literary Award, longlisted. ==Adaptations== As part of the significant advance Carter obtained with Knopf in 2001, Knopf received the rights to any subsequent screen adaptations of The Emperor of Ocean Park. Variety reported that, after reading an early version of the manuscript, a number of production companies were interested in acquiring the rights to create a movie adaptation of the novel. The rights were preemptively optioned by Warner Brothers, John Wells Productions, and Gaylord Films prior to the novel being published. Stephen Schiff completed a script adaptation in 2003 which was attached to director Carl Franklin, and Attica Locke, novelist, screenwriter and producer for the series Empire, completed another script in 2009. Actor Wendell Pierce said in early 2015 that a movie adaptation of The Emperor of Ocean Park would be his dream project. It was also reported in 2015 that writer Katori Hall was working with John Wells on a television pilot of The Emperor of Ocean Park for Fox Network. Later that year writer Frank Bergon said that \\"last heard, the script was \\"under rewrite\\", maybe in \\"turnaround\\".\\" ==References== ==External links== *Reading Guide to The Emperor of Ocean Park ‚Äì Penguin Publishing *Interview with Stephen L.

Their activity appears to be dependent on calcium. The discovery of malacidins was published in 2018. The malacidin family were discovered using a new method of soil microbiome screening that does not require cell culturing. This allowed researchers to identify genetic components necessary to produce the chemical. Malacidin A was shown to kill Staphylococcus aureus and other Gram-positive bacteria. At the time of publication it was not certain if the discovery would lead to any new antibiotic drugs, because large investments of time and money are required to determine whether any drug is safe and effective. ==Chemical structure== Malacidins are macrocycle lipopeptides. The 2018 paper described two chemicals in the malacidin family, differing only by a methylene at their lipid tails. Their peptide cores include four non-proteinogenic amino acids. The name \\"malacidin\\" is derived from the abbreviation of metagenomic acidic lipopeptide antibiotic and the suffix -cidin. ==Mechanism of action== Malacidins appear to take on their active conformation after they bind to calcium; the calcium- bound molecule then appears to bind to lipid II, a bacterial cell wall precursor molecule, leading to destruction of the cell wall and death of the bacteria. Therefore, they would be a new member of the class of calcium- dependent antibiotics. The discovery of malacidins supported the view that the calcium-dependent antibiotics are a larger class than previously thought. ==History== Malacidins were discovered by researchers at Rockefeller University, led by Brad Hover and Sean Brady. The group had been looking into antibiotics related to daptomycin and their calcium-dependent nature, but determined that it would be impractical to culture variations in lab conditions. Instead, the team used a genetics approach that was more scalable. They focused on searching for novel biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) ‚Äì genes that are usually expressed together, that bacteria use to make secondary metabolites. To do this, they extracted DNA from around 2,000 soil samples to build metagenomic libraries that captured the genetic diversity of the environmental microbiome. They then designed degenerate primers to amplify genes likely to be similar to the BGC that make daptomycin by using a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) procedure, sequenced the amplified genes, and then used metagenomics to confirm that these genes were indeed likely to be the kind of BGCs they sought. One of the novel BGCs they found was present in around 19% of the screened soil samples but not readily found in cultured microbial collections, so they took that BGC, put it into other host bacteria, and then isolated and analyzed the secondary metabolites. The work was published in Nature Microbiology in February 2018. ==Research directions== The approach of screening the soil for useful compounds using genomics has been done by others, and is likely to continue to be pursued as a method to further explore primary metabolites and secondary metabolites made by microorganisms. , the malacidins had not been tested on humans. At the time of their discovery it was unknown whether the discovery would lead to any new antibiotic drugs; showing that a potential drug is safe and effective takes years of work and millions of dollars, and the scientists said at the time that they had no plans to try to develop a drug based on the work. In the 2018 paper, malacidins were shown to kill only Gram-positive bacteria and not Gram- negative bacteria. They were, however, able to kill multidrug-resistant pathogens, including bacteria resistant to vancomycin in the laboratory, and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) skin infections in an animal wound model. Brady, Hover, and two other authors disclosed in the 2018 paper that they had \\"competing financial interests, as they are employees or consultants of Lodo Therapeutics.\\" Lodo was founded in 2016 out of Brady's laboratory, to discover new chemicals in nature as starting points for drug discovery. ==See also== * Teixobactin * Friulimicin ==References== Category:Antimicrobial peptides Category:Lipopeptides Category:Soil biology Category:Cyclic peptides ","title":"Malacidin"},{"id":"56576426","text":"Maskoskanaw River is a tributary of Frontenac Lake (Milieu River), flowing into the unorganized territory of Lac-Ashuapmushuan, Quebec, in the Regional County Municipality (MRC) of Le Domaine-du-Roy, in the administrative region of Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean, in Quebec, in Canada.

There, Josefina took care of her sister while her mother worked washing clothes in the houses. Later, Josefina went to work as a trouser dresser in a clothing workshop. At age 12 she started militancy in the Unified Socialist Youth, and at 14 she joined the PCE at the hands of Roberto Carrillo, brother of Santiago Carrillo. As a party activist, Josefina participated in the distribution of the Espa√±a Popular publications. She also organized the children of the neighborhood to warn using cans as a drum every time the police arrived in search of the hidden Republicans. She also created a kind of cooperative dedicated to the manufacture of raffia shoes with which she helped to maintain her house, as well as that of many other families, mostly of political emigrants. Josefina was responsible for getting the raffia. The benefits were divided according to the pairs of shoes they made, with Josefina obtaining the lowest profits.Entrevista a Josefina Samper: \\"Ten√≠a claro que s√≥lo me casar√≠a con un hombre que compartiera mis ideas\\" === Work with Marcelino Camacho === Soon, together with other women, she formed a support group for immigrants and political refugees, which, in 1944, led her to receive, on behalf of the party, the task of organizing an aperitif for three prisoners fled from the concentration camp. That is how she met Marcelino Camacho, with whom she married on December 22, 1948 and who had two children, Yenia and Marcel. In 1957, after the pardon of Marcelino, they returned from exile, moving to the neighborhood of Carabanchel, in Madrid, in a modest apartment where they lived until, already in 2010, Marcelino's health forced them to move to another floor in Majadahonda. In his neighborhood of Carabanchel both continued their clandestine political and trade union activity that led to the successive imprisonment of Marcelino. It was then that Josefina and other women, some wives of prisoners and others simply Communist women, mobilized, creating in 1965 the Women's Democratic Movement, germen of the current feminist movement, dedicated to fighting, inside and outside of Spain, to help political prisoners, achieving certain improvements in the conditions in which they were confined. During these years, Josefina gave up looking for a job outside the home, because she needed to dedicate all her time to the cause, so her children, Yenia and Marcel, took responsibility for taking the salary to the family home, while Josefina spent the little time she had to sew pants for a tailor shop and knit sweaters for a wool store. On November 25, 1975, King Juan Carlos I granted a pardon to the prisoners who had been imprisoned by the , including Marcelino Camacho. Thus began a new life outside the clandestine life that allowed them to rekindle the political and union struggle that Josefina still maintained a few years after the death of Marcelino. ===Later years=== After the death of Marcelino Camacho on 29 October 2010, Josefina maintained a great activity as a transmitter of the memory and voice of her husband, offering frequent talks throughout Spain, helping to inspire the struggle for workers' rights to the new generations.

He was the earliest Wesleyan missionary in Germany. ==Biography== Lyth was born on 13 March 1821 in York. He attended Mr. Heigham's Academy in Doncaster, and began work as a preacher in 1843. In 1859 he became the first Wesleyan missionary in Germany, serving as the General Superintendent of the Wesleyan Community from 1859 to 1865. Lyth retired from the ministry in 1883, and died on 13 March 1886. == Works == === Prose === Lyth contributed to four major prose publications during his lifetime. In 1843, he published the History of Methodism in York. This is considered his main work of prose, despite his later release of Glimpses in Early Methodism in York in 1885. Glimpses of Methodism in York covers from the introduction of Methodism in 1729 up to the date of publication. Upon his mother's death in 1860, Lyth compiled and published The Blessedness of Religion In Earnest: A Memorial of Mrs. Mary Lyth, of York. Published in 1861 and constructed mainly from Mary's journal entries, Lyth created this memorial because he felt \\"an example of 'Religion in Earnest,' so pre-eminent, should not pass unrecorded and unimproved.\\" Half a decade later, Lyth published The Homiletical Treasury; or, Scripture Analytically Arranged. Originally intended to encompass the entire Bible, The Homiletical Treasury only covers Isaiah (published in 1867) and the Epistles from Romans to Philippians (published 1869). At the date of publication, the London Quarterly Review \\"[commended] the work, and [trusted] that Mr. Lyth [would] be encouraged to continue his labors,\\" and his work was cited often in an 1884 homiletical commentary. Charles Spurgeon, however, found Homiletical Treasury to be incomplete and surface. === Hymns and poetry === Lyth also wrote a few hymns. \\"There Is a Better World, They Say\\" is a hymn originally written for an infant school in Randwick. Lyth said \\"that it was written for infant children will explain the simplicity of some of the expressions.\\" Lyth claimed this hymn was based on an earlier piece and dates its writing as 30 April 1845. It was written to the tune of \\"All is Well,\\" and first appeared in the Home and School Hymn Book. He also wrote \\"We Won't Give Up the Sabbath,\\" which was included in the Methodist Sunday School Hymn Book in 1879. Both hymns are imitations of older works. Wild Flowers; or, a Selection of Original Poetry, edited by J. L. was compiled and published in 1843. All of the poems Lyth included were written by himself, a family member, or Dr. Punshon. Lyth's verse rendering of Marcus Aurelius's Meditations was published in 1942, with a preface by Gilbert Murray. == References == Category:1821 births Category:1886 deaths Category:English Methodist missionaries Category:English hymnwriters Category:19th-century English theologians Category:19th-century English historians Category:English expatriates in Germany Category:Clergy from York ","title":"John Lyth"},{"id":"56576670","text":"Konan (stylised as KONAN, born 4 March 1985) is a Japanese singer, tarento, and gravure idol who is a former member of the female idol group SDN48.

As a two-year-old in 1899 she showed some promise, winning once from six attempts, but appeared to be some way below top class. In the following season, when tried over longer distance, she emerged as one of the best horses of her generation in England, winning the Oaks Stakes, Manchester Cup, Yorkshire Oaks and Newmarket Oaks as well as finishing fourth in the 1000 Guineas and third in the Doncaster Cup. She was retired at the end of the season to become a broodmare and had considerable success as a dam of winners. ==Background== La Roche was a small bay mare with no black leg points bred in England by her owner the 6th Duke of Portland. She was trained throughout her racing career by John Porter at his Kingsclere stable in Berkshire. As a three-year-old was described as \\"very sharp-looking, but not quite big enough for the best company. She was one of the last notable horses sired by St. Simon, an undefeated racehorse who was considered one of the best British runners of the 19th Century. In an outstanding stud career he won nine sires‚Äô championships, having sired ten Classic winners. Her dam, Miss Mildred showed no ability as a racehorse but was a granddaughter of the influential British broodmare Braxey. ==Racing career== ===1899: two-year-old season=== On the day of the 1899 Epsom Oaks La Roche ran promisingly in the Acorn Stakes, finishing second to Dum Dum in a thirteen-runner field. La Roche was matched against male opponent in the British Dominion Two-Year-Old Race over five furlongs at Sandown Park on 24 June but after showing good early speed she came home last of the five runners behind Stealaway. She recorded her only victory of the year in September when she won the Prince of Wales's Nursery at Doncaster September. On her final run of the season she ran third in the Osmaston Nursery Plate at Derby Racecourse in November, conceding weight to the first finishers. ===1900: three-year-old season=== On 4 May La Roche began her second campaign in the 1000 Guineas at Newmarket Racecourse, starting at odds of 10/7 against ten opponents. Ridden by Mornington Cannon, she ran \\"very well\\" to take fourth place behind Winifreda, Inquisitive and Vain Duchess. At Epsom Racecourse on 1 June La Roche, with Cannon again in the saddle, started the 5/1 third choice in the betting behind Winifreda and Lady Schomberg in a fourteen-runner field for the 122nd running of the Oaks Stakes. The weather was cold and windy and the crowd was unusually small although it included the Prince of Wales. Commenting on his trainee's chances before the race John Porter had said \\"she will run well, for she is a rare little sticker\\". La Roche was settled in mid-division before making steady progress into third place behind Lady Schomberg and Paigle entering the straight. She took the lead a quarter of a mile from the finish and drew away to win very easily by three lengths from Merry Gal, with Lady Schomberg coming home a distant third. The Oaks form received a boost on 5 July when Merry Gal scored an upset victory over Diamond Jubilee in the Princess of Wales's Stakes at Newmarket. One week after her Oaks triumph, La Roche followed up by \\"cantering\\" to victory under 107 pounds in the valuable Manchester Cup, a handicap race over one and three quarter miles at Manchester Racecourse. La Roche won again at York Racecourse on 28 August, when she \\"slaughtered\\" the opposition to take the Yorkshire Oaks from Inquisitive and Vain Duchess at odds of 1/4. La Roche had never been entered in the St Leger, for which she might well have started favourite, and so was instead matched against older horses in the two and a quarter mile Doncaster Cup on 14 September at the same meeting. Despite carrying a ten pound weight penalty she started 5/6 favourite but after leading into the straight she was overtaken and beaten into third place behind King's Courier and Merry Gal. On her penultimate start of the year she started 1/10 favourite for the two-mile Newmarket Oaks on 9 October and won by eight lengths from her two opponents. For her final run of the season La Roche was assigned top weight of 122 for the Cambridgeshire Handicap over eight and a half furlongs at Newmarket on 24 October. Racing over a much shorter distance than she had attempted since May, she finished unplaced behind the four-year- old colt Berrill. La Roche earned ¬£8,000 as a three-year-old. ==Assessment and honours== In their book, A Century of Champions, based on the Timeform rating system, John Randall and Tony Morris rated La Roche an \\"average\\" winner of the Oaks. ==Breeding record== After being retired from racing at the end of her second season, La Roche became a broodmare for the Duke of Portland's stud. La Roche was euthanized in 1920. She produced at least eight foals and three winners between 1902 and 1920: *Ormsby, a colt, foaled in 1902, sired by Orme *Caroline Roche, chestnut filly, 1904, by Carbine *Roche Abbey, brown filly, 1905, by Cyllene *Grotte de Han, bay filly, 1907, by Isinglass.

(1974). The asymptotic structure of counterflow diffusion flames for large activation energies. Acta Astronautica, 1(7-8), 1007-1039.Williams, F. A. (1985). Combustion Theory, (1985). Cummings Publ.

Combustion and Flame, 175, 91-106. Li√±√°n used counterflowing jets of fuel and oxidizer to study the diffusion flame structure, analyzing for the entire range of Damk√∂hler number. His theory predicted four different type of flame structure as follows, * Nearly- frozen ignition regime, where deviations from the frozen flow conditions are small (no reaction sheet exist in this regime), * Partial burning regime, where both fuel and oxidizer cross the reaction zone and enter into the frozen flow on other side, * Premixed flame regime, where only one of the reactants cross the reaction zone, in which case, reaction zone separates a frozen flow region from a near-equilibrium region, * Near-equilibrium diffusion-controlled regime, is a thin reaction zone, separating two near-equilibrium region. ==Mathematical description== The theory is well explained in the simplest possible model. Thus, assuming a one-step irreversible Arrhenius law for the combustion chemistry with constant density and transport properties and with unity Lewis number reactants, the governing equation for the non-dimensional temperature field T(y) in the stagnation point flow reduces to :\\\\frac{d^2 T}{dy^2} + y\\\\frac{dT}{dy} = -\\\\mathrm{Da}\\\\ y_F y_O e^{-T_a/T}, \\\\quad Z= \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\mathrm{erfc}\\\\left(\\\\frac{y}{\\\\sqrt 2}\\\\right) where Z is the mixture fraction, \\\\mathrm{Da} is the Damk√∂hler number, T_a = E/R is the activation temperature and the fuel mass fraction and oxidizer mass fraction are scaled with their respective feed stream values, given by :\\\\begin{align} y_F &= Z + T_o - T \\\\\\\\\\\\ y_O &= (1-Z)/S + T_o - T \\\\end{align} with boundary conditions T(-\\\\infty)=T(\\\\infty)=T_o. Here, T_o is the unburnt temperature profile (frozen solution) and S is the stoichiometric parameter (mass of oxidizer stream required to burn unit mass of fuel stream). The four regime are analyzed by trying to solve above equations using activation energy asymptotics and Damk√∂hler number asymptotics. The solution to above problem is multi-valued. Treating mixture fraction Z as independent variable reduces the equation to :\\\\frac{d^2 T}{dZ^2} = - 2\\\\pi e^{y^2} \\\\mathrm{Da}\\\\ y_F y_O e^{-T_a/T} with boundary conditions T(0)=T(1)=T_o and y = \\\\sqrt{2} \\\\mathrm{erfc}^{-1}(2Z). ==Extinction Damk√∂hler number== The reduced Damk√∂hler number is defined as follows :\\\\delta = 8\\\\pi Z_s^2 e^{y_s^2} \\\\left(\\\\frac{T_s^2}{T_a}\\\\right)^3 \\\\mathrm{Da}\\\\ e^{-T_a/T} where y_s =\\\\sqrt{2} \\\\mathrm{erfc}^{-1}(2Z_s),\\\\ Z_s = 1/(S+1) and T_s = T_o + Z_s.

In 1348 she married Rudolf II, Count Palatine of the Rhine, and was Countess Palatine of the Rhine until 1353, year of the husband's death. ==Life== Margaret was the youngest daughter of King Frederick II of Sicily-Aragon (1272-1337) and his wife Eleanore, daughter of Charles II of Anjou. Her parents resided in Palermo, where she presumably was born. In 1348 Margaret married the widowed Count Palatine Rudolf II from the house of Wittelsbach, who lived in Neustadt an der Weinstra√üe. In 1349 Rudolf II married his daughter from his first marriage, Anna von der Pfalz, to King Charles IV, one of the most important rulers of the late Middle Ages. Anna died in Prague in 1353. Count Rudolf finally retired because of increasing illness, and handed the government business over to his brother and successor Ruprecht, who in 1356 was able to acquire the Electorate for the Palatinate. Rudolf II was nicknamed the blind, because he had a serious eye disease and was blind in his last year of life. The marriage of Rudolf II and Margaret of Sicily-Aragon remained childless. Elizabeth of Portugal (1271-1336), Margaret's father's sister, is revered as a saint. Her mother's brother, Louis of Toulouse, is also one of the saints of the Catholic Church. ==Death and commemoration== Pfalzgraf Rudolf II decreed that the church of Saint √Ñgidius (Giles) in Neustadt should be converted into a memoria‚Äîa place of prayer and commemoration‚Äîfor the Wittelsbachs, and wished to be buried there. After his death on October 4, 1353, he was buried according to his wishes in front of the altar of the Neustadt parish church of St. Giles. In 1356 Elector Ruprecht I donated the Liebfrauen-Kollegiatstift Neustadt as memorial for his family, according to the will of his brother Rudolf II. He had the parish church of St. √Ñgidius rebuilt and extended to the east with a splendid choir. The chancel area of this new church, the present Neustadt collegiate church, was built in 1368 according to a column inscription. The altar of the new church now moved a good way east and the square in front of the altar of the old parish church, where Rudolf II had been buried, was now at the transition from the nave to the new choir area. At this point, in 1377, the Countess Margaret of Sicily-Aragon was buried next to her husband Rudolf II. She had survived him by 24 years. Margaret of Sicily-Aragon received a splendid Gothic epitaph. Because of her royal origin, she is depicted on it with a crown. The gravestone is now located on the far north wall of the catholic church area and is one of the sights in Neustadt. Her husband Rudolf II possessed a similarly ornate grave plate, which, however, has survived only badly damaged and is also located in the Catholic church section on the rear south wall, opposite to his wife. The graves of Count Palatine Rudolf and Countess Margaret of Sicily-Aragon lie in the rear of the Catholic part of the church, about the center, but are split by the 1707/1708 dividing wall between the Protestant nave and Catholic choir. In 1906 they were opened and re-covered with modern stone slabs, but not marked in the floor. Around 1910, city pastor Michael Glaser (1863-1915) erected four large statues of the Palatine rulers Rudolf II and Ruprecht I, and the women buried by their side Beatrix of Berg and Margaret of Sicily-Aragon. They were created by the Munich sculptor Hubert Netzer from white Kelheim limestone and are located on the northern and southern nave wall of the Catholic part of the church. The sculptures, in the historicist style, are modeled on ancient representations. The two statues of women and the figure of Count Palatine Rudolf II are based on the images on their epitaphs in the collegiate church. ==References== Category:House of Barcelona (Sicily) Category:Sicilian princesses Category:People from Palermo Category:14th-century German women Category:14th-century German people Category:1331 births Category:1377 deaths ","title":"Margaret of Sicily, Countess Palatine of the Rhine"},{"id":"56577716","text":"The 1951 Turkish Football Championship was the 16th and last edition of the competition.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1993. ==History== Vermontville was first settled in 1836; it slowly developed, and in 1871 was incorporated into a village. At some point before 1881, an opera house was constructed in the village, and was owned by a succession of local residents until it burned in the mid-1890s. In 1895, the Vermontville Township purchased this plot of land and began construction of the opera house on the site, with the cornerstone laid on August 27. The building was completed in 1896. The auditorium was well-used for dances, lectures, plays, musical performances, and vaudeville over the next several decades. The first story of the opera house originally housed office and meeting spaces for Vermontville Township and Village, along with the village's fire apparatus at the rear of the building. In 1948, the Vermontville Library took over the former village council rooms. In 1973, the fire department moved out and the library expanded; the building itself was renovated by infilling the former fire house doors.. As of 2018, the building still housed both the library and the Township offices. ==Description== The Vermontville Opera House is a rectangular three-story structure with walls faced in concrete block in the first story and red brick above. The building has a mansard roof and a foundation of rock-face fieldstone ashlar. Window bays are separated by slightly projecting piers, which stretch upward to the cornice line. The windows have segmental arches and cut stone sills and caps with prominent keystones. The cornice is or pressed metal. A square tower at one corner has a bell-shaped roof and paired windows with store trim. On the main facade are two entrances: a single door in the center leading into the first story, and an entrance in the tower leading to the auditorium at the second floor level. The building contains a first floor originally housing offices and the fire department, and now houses the library. The upper floors housing a level-floor auditorium with rear gallery. The auditorium is entered through a lobby, where a ticket office is also located. The auditorium itself is a two-story high space, flat in the center and sloping around the perimeter.

It was based on the DR- DOS operating system and networking components from Novell as well as the Arachne web browser by Michal Pol√°k of xChaos software. The system was designed to run on low-end desktop systems, but being able to boot and execute from disk as well as from ROM or network, it was also tailored for x86-based thin clients and embedded systems with or without disk drives. Using the web browser as its principal user interface, it could be also used for kiosk systems and set-top boxes. Named Embrowser, it has been ported to Linux in 1999 and was called Embedix Browser since 2000. ==NIOS and IOS== DR-WebSpyder was originally conceived as project NIOS (Novell Internet Operating System) at Novell's European Development Centre (EDC), UK in 1994 by then DR-DOS engineer Roger Alan Gross, who was working on Novell's Embedded Systems Technology (NEST) initiative to create embedded system applications that connect intelligent devices to NetWare networks. NIOS was conceived as a thin client operating system that provided Novell with a graphical client operating system to run web applications hosted on NetWare, creating a Novell-centric platform for software as a service (SaaS) that did not require Microsoft's Windows operating system. NIOS comprised 32-bit versions of Novell's existing 16-bit DOS technologies including the DR-DOS operating system, Novell's modem dialer and TCP/IP stack from LAN Workplace for DOS / NetWare Mobile plus licensed third-party components such as the Kaffe Java virtual machine (JVM), Allegro for graphics, and Mosaic for the web browser. ==WebSpyder, WebSpyder 32 and DR-WebSpyder== Gross's plans were interrupted when Caldera, Inc. acquired the remaining Digital Research assets including DR-DOS from Novell on 23 July 1996, but without the personnel. Gross telephoned Caldera's Ransom H. Love the same day offering to set up a new DR-DOS team outside of Novell. Gross subsequently joined Caldera as general manager of the Digital Research Systems Group (DSG) in December that year and set about rehiring the DRDOS/NIOS team in the UK to develop the new operating system and web browser. Under Caldera, NIOS was renamed IOS (Internet Operating System). The plan to use Mosaic was also dropped and instead Caldera licensed the source code of the 16-bit DOS web browser Arachne. The team replaced Arachne's dialer and packet drivers with Novell's dialer, ODI driver suite (from Personal NetWare etc.) and TCP/IP stack, added support for animated and scaled GIFs, an optional on-screen keyboard for mouse and touch panel usage (SoftKeyboards) for possible keyboardless operation, and an install program. Also, they completely changed the design of the browser (customizable chrome), implemented support for NetScape-compatible frames, and used Allegro for graphics. The browser also supported \\"execute links\\" to run and interact with DOS programs and batchjobs run on the web client, a feature originally introduced as DOS Gateway Interface (DGI) in Arachne. IOS became formally known as WebSpyder in May 1997. Some months later, it was ported to compile as a 32-bit protected mode extended DOS application (utilizing DPMI using DJGPP, a GNU compiler for DOS), then referred to as WebSpyder 32, but renamed DR-WebSpyder in early 1998. On 11 May 1998, Caldera started shipping DR-WebSpyder 2.0 as both a HTML 3.2 web browser application and browser OS. On 1 June 1998, the company opened a sales and support office in Taiwan to be close to potential OEM customers. A maintenance release DR-WebSpyder 2.0a was issued on 19 August 1998. Caldera distributed a free demo version of DR-WebSpyder 2.0a on a bootable fully self- contained 3.5-inch floppy. This was in fact the DR-WebSpyder OS configured as loosely coupled components in which a special version of the DR-DOS ANSI.SYS driver would mute the stream of text messages at startup of the DOS system while a graphical company logo was displayed until the web browser was launched as a shell via CONFIG.SYS SHELL replacing the default COMMAND.COM command line interpreter. On 386 PCs with a minimum of 4 MB of RAM, the floppy would boot the DR-DOS 7.02 based browser operating system complete with memory manager, RAM disk, dial-up modem, LAN, mouse and display drivers and automatically launch into the graphical browser, without ever touching the machine's hard disk in order not to interfere with other systems installed on the machine and to demonstrate its potential usage in diskless workstations. Users could start browsing the web or accessing mails immediately after entering their access credentials. A further refined international revision of the demo by Matthias R. Paul utilized more sophisticated multi-level compression to free enough space on the floppy image to also include menu options and additional drivers to choose between several languages and keyboard layouts and give room for further expansion or customization of the operation system and browser through OEMs or users. On 2 September 1998, it was announced that the Digital Research Systems Group and consequently also Caldera UK was spun out as a separate company Caldera Thin Clients (CTC), incorporated earlier in August 1998. In September 1998, DR-WebSpyder 2.0 achieved commercial success when it was selected for use in an internet set- top box as part of a satellite internet access solution. On 3 November 1998, the company announced DR-WebSpyder 2.1. With DR-WebSpyder 2.1 Beta 2 being available since 7 November 1998, the browser was released on 30 November 1998. It added support for JavaScript, the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol, cookies, sound files, printing on a multitude of printers as well as user profiles and support for multiple mail accounts. It also added scrollable quarter-screen VGA support for low-resolution LCD displays as well as anti- aliased fonts for display on TVs in an optional TV interface mode. Caldera UK also investigated possibilities to add Java and JVM support to the browser, but this component never left prototype status. Two desired prerequisites for Java integration were to add support for long filenames (LFNs) and Unicode to DOS. Caldera's DPMS-enabled dynamically loadable LONGNAME driver provided VFAT-compatible LFNs in the FAT file system utilizing UCS-2 internally. Matthias R. Paul conducted research how to achieve this with minimal changes to the existing system and to not cause bloat to an operating system also tailored for thin clients and embedded systems. Expanded DRFONT-style .CPI files could have been provided to retrieve bitmaps for the required larger character repertoire (Basic Multilingual Plane) not only to support a lot more code pages in general, but also wider character sets similar to what was used in DOS/V-compatible systems. In conjunction with a new COUNTRY.SYS file, Paul's enhanced NLSFUNC 4.xx driver, which was introduced with DR-DOS 7.02, could have provided the framework to integrate optional UTF-8 support into the system in a way similar to DBCS support. When Gross resigned in January 1999, Caldera Thin Clients, Inc. closed the Caldera UK Ltd. development office in February 1999 soon after the release of DR-DOS 7.03. ==Embrowser and Embedix Browser== A customized version of Lineo Embrowser in 1999 On 20 July 1999, Caldera Thin Clients renamed itself into Lineo under the new lead of Bryan Wayne Sparks. DR-WebSpyder was renamed Embrowser and the browser was said to be ported to Linux. A version of DR-WebSpyder for IMS REAL/32, a successor to Digital Research's and Novell's Multiuser DOS, has been worked on in 1999 as well. Since October 1999, a DOS version of DR-WebSpyder 2.5 aka Embrowser 2.5 was available on Lineo's site. Since Lineo's own thin-client Linux distribution was named Embedix, the Linux port of the micro web browser was consequently named Embedix Browser by April 2000. In April 2002, some Lineo assets were auctioned off and the company reformed as Embedix, Inc. by July 2002 under the lead of Matthew R. Harris. Motorola's Metrowerks bought Embedix key assets, possibly including the browser, on 17 December 2002. ==Features== ==See also== * Arachne (web browser) * Citrix WinFrame * Chrome OS * DR-DOS * FreeDOS * Comparison of web browsers * List of web browsers * LAN WorkPlace for DOS * Caldera View * iCentrix MarioNet * Novell Corsair * WebTV ==Notes== ==References== ==Further reading== * ==External links== * Caldera, Inc.

She bore him an illegitimate son, Don Giovanni de' Medici. ==History== She was the daughter of an ancient Florentine family of moderate means, daughter of Luigi degli Albizzi and Nannina Soderini. With the consent of her father, by 1565, at the age of about 23‚Äì24 years, she became the mistress of the Granduke, who was a widower since the death of Eleonora of Toledo in 1562. In 1566, Albizzi bore the Duke a daughter who soon died as an infant. In 1567, she bore him the son Giovanni. Rumors began to circulate that Cosimo wish to legitimize his union to Eleonora. Tradition holds that his long-time chamberlain Sforza Almeni of Perugia shared the Duke's desires with Francesco I, the legitimate heir who was increasingly the dominant force in the government. Francesco, likely worried about the entry of potential heirs and a mother-in-law, scolded his father about those plans. Thereupon, seized by rage because his secret desires had been revealed, on May 22, 1566, the Granduke is said to personally stabbed his chamberlain to death.Opere de Benvenuto Cellini, Volume 2, by Benvenuto Cellini, footnote quotes Galluzi, page 249.Istoria del Granducato di Toscana sotto il governo della casa Medici, Volume 2; by Jacopo Riguccio Galluzzi; 1781.Frescos by Vasari for Sforza Almeni, 'Coppiere to Duke Cosimo I, by Charles Davis. This event, along with others episodes such as the rumored murder of Filippo Strozzi the Younger, reinforced a perception that Cosimo was possessed of an excessively passionate, if not bloodthirsty, ruthlessness. The love affair between Cosimo and Eleonora quickly cooled, and by 1567 she was forced to marry the dishonored nobleman Carlo Panciatichi. Cosimo meanwhile latched on to an affair with another young woman, Camilla Martelli. Panchiato had faced execution for rebellion, and was herewith pardoned and granted a reward of 10 thousand scudi to take Eleonora. It is unclear what role his legitimate children played in arranging to remove Albizzi from the Grand Duke's orbit. Eleonora had three children with Carlo, including Bartolomeo (born 1577). However, in 1578, she was accused of adultery and confined to the Monastery of Fuligno.

One of Venezuela's most celebrated singers, she performed in concert halls throughout Latin America and Europe. ==Early life, education and family== Born in Caracas on 11 October 1912, Alem√°n began to play the piano when she was six. Her vocal talents were recognized from an early age, especially when she reached her teens. She studied at the Escuela de M√∫sica y Declamaci√≥n in Caracas before training in New York under Fausto Cleva and, in particular, Alfredo Hollander in Caracas. In her early twenties, Alem√°n married the American cellist Mario Di Polo whom she met in New York when she was 22. They remained married until he died in 1975. The couple had three children: Reinaldo, a scientific researcher; Mario, a violinist, and Frank, a trumpeter. ==Career== Her first recording, on the RCA Victor label, was made in New York while her first public performance was in 1936 at Caracas's Teatro Municipal. It was also here she sang her first opera, Pergolesi's La serva padrona. She went on to perform leading roles in Verdi's Rigoletto and La Traviata. From 1950, her concert tours reached North America, Brazil and Europe. She performed in the United States, in Rio de Janeiro, and in 1951 in the Caribbean.

The hindwing beneath is shaded with silvery grey, having a strong metallic green gloss and being without the distinct silver bands of paphia. Throughout Eastern Asia; first described from China, but also occurring in Tibet, Amurland, Corea and Japan, ab. crassipunctata Fruhst. are specimens with larger spots above, which occur among the otherwise very constant nymolypical form (Leech). ‚Äî Specimens from the island of Tsushima Fruhstorfer names prasoides; the subapical spots on the forewing above of the male are smaller than in specimens from China and Japan; in the female the basal area of the upperside is more abundantly dusted with light green and the hindwing beneath has a deeper sea-green tinge. ‚Äî The species is very abundant in most localities in the warmer districts of Eastern Asia, but does not appear to go very far north; though being still plentiful on Askold, it is according to Graeser already rare near Wladiwostock, which is hardly further north.

When he was 11, Plantey was in a car accident on Route 22 over the town of Senillosa. His father and brother died, and Plantey suffered a spinal cord injury that left him in a wheelchair. After the accident, he traveled to Cuba for four months with his mother for physical therapy. Despite his injury, Plantey's high school physical education teacher encouraged him to continue practicing sports such as basketball, volleyball and handball. His first contact with adapted skiing was at the age of 14, when he was on vacation with friends in San Martin de los Andes. He was approached by the head of the Argentine adapted ski team who invited him to try skiing. In 2010, Plantey travelled to Aspen, Colorado, U.S., where he had the opportunity to compete against Taylor Walker, the number one-ranked adapted skier. After returning to Argentina, he contacted an instructor who was creating an adapted skiing team in Mendoza Province, and began training at Las Le√±as. In 2010, Plantey travelled the five continents with a friend, writing his experiences in a blog. ==Sports career== In December 2010, Plantey competed at Copper Mountain, U.S. He finished in 19th place at the 2014 Sochi Paralympic Games and third place in the French National Championship. In 2017, Plantey was ranked 13th in the Alpine Ski World Championship held in Kranjska Gora , Slovenia.

For being one of the first 13 soldiers to cross the Dnieper she was awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union on 23 October 1943. == Prewar life == Shcherbachenko was born on 14 February 1922 to a Ukrainian peasant family in the village of Yefremovka (Ukrainian: Yefremivka) in the Kharkov Governorate. Her older brother Andrey raised her after the death of both of their parents. Upon graduating from secondary school she worked as an accountant's assistant on a collective farm in her village. == World War II== Shcherbachenko hid during the German occupation of her village to avoid being deported and forced to conduct hard labor. Soviet troops expelled German forces from Yefremovka in February 1943, after which she worked in the construction of defensive structures on the Donets river until joining the Red Army in March. She then underwent medical training in Samarkand before she was deployed as part of the 835th Rifle Regiment in July. On 24 September 1943 she was one of the first 13 soldiers to reach the right bank of the Dnieper River, doing so under heavy enemy fire in the village of Grebeni in the Kiev oblast. Throughout ten days of intense battle she rescued 112 injured soldiers from the battlefield, providing first aid and transporting them back across the river to a medical center. In the beginning of the offensive she operated a machine gun in battle. On 23 October 1943 she was awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union by decree of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet for her actions in the Dnieper battle. After receiving the title she continued to serve on the frontlines until being recalled from the front in May 1944 to give a speech at the 3rd Youth Anti-Fascist Rally in Moscow. After speaking at the rally she was sent to study at the Kharkov Military Medical School, which had been relocated to Ashgabat, Turkmenistan due to the war; however, she did not graduate from the school. ==Postwar== After the war she left the military. She then graduated from Tashkent Law School and worked as a lawyer in Kiev. For her dedication to rescuing the wounded in battle she was awarded the Florence Nightingale Medal by the International Red Cross in 1973.

It is considered plausible that P. brasilianum in platyrrhines is a result of the cross-species transfer of P. malariae brought to the New World by settlers in the post-Columbus era. As P. malariae and P. brasilianum have now been demonstrated to be genetically identical based on 18S rRNA sequences, it has been proposed that P. brasilianum be subsumed under the name P. malariae. == Distribution == Plasmodium brasilianum naturally infects species of primates from all New World monkey families from a large geographic area in Central and South America. The parasite has been found in Panama, Venezuela, Colombia, Peru, Brazil, and French Guiana. == Hosts == Natural infection of P. brasilianum has been found in tamarins and marmosets of the genera Callithrix, Leontopithecus and Mico in the Atlantic forest. Also Anopheles freeborni mosquitoes infected by feeding on a platyrrhine spider monkey (Ateles geoffroyi geoffroyi) from Panama carrying P. brasilianum, have been shown to transmit the parasite through biting to five human volunteers.

This first forms isocyanogen tetraazide, the ‚Äúopen‚Äù isomer of C2N14, while quickly cyclizes under standard conditions to form a tetrazole ring. == Hazards == Nearly any stimulus, such as heat, radiation, or physical shock, will cause 1-diazidocarbamoyl-5-azidotetrazole to detonate. It may also detonate unpredictably and for no apparent reason. This is part of the high energy nitrogen compound family as the nitrogen atoms do not have strong triple bonds and so are stuck in a high energy state until detonation and then change into a less energetic state. When an attempt was made to chart its infrared spectrum using Raman spectroscopy, it exploded. ==References== ==See also== * == External Links == * * Category:Tetrazoles Category:Azides Category:Explosives Category:Explosive chemicals ","title":"1-Diazidocarbamoyl-5-azidotetrazole"},{"id":"56579388","text":"Vladimir Nikolayevich Solovyov (Russian: –í–ª–∞–¥–∏–º–∏—Ä –ù–∏–∫–æ–ª–∞–µ–≤–∏—á –°–æ–ª–æ–≤—å—ë–≤; born 21 November 1946) is a Soviet rower from Russia.

Her mother was Bavarian and her father was a naturalized British subject. In 1920 Osborne had her first photographic exhibition in Copenhagen. Between 1922 and 1924 she operated a portrait studio in Baden-Baden and in 1925 she located the studio to Giselastra√üe 1, in Munich. In this time she also made theater-photography. In 1925 Osborne became a member of the Gesellschaft Deutscher Lichtbildner, Society of German Photographers. Her portrait subjects included Jean Arp, Albert Schweitzer and a production of King Lear in a style tinged with expressionism.Sir Rabindranath Tagore, by Li Osborne, In 1934 Osborne sold her studio and emigrated to Switzerland. During World War II, in Zurich, she began to teach herself sculpture. Although largely self-taught as a sculptor, she received advice from many internationally known artists, while living in Switzerland. In 1945 Osborne moved to East Bergholt in England and dedicated her time to sculpture. Her sculptures were based on figuration and expressiveness and she often left traces of her working of the material in the finished piece, in contrast to the smooth abstract work of others. In 1953 and 1956 works by her were shown at the Beaux-Arts Gallery, London. In 1953 she was one of the twelve British artists included in the international competition for the monument to the Unknown Political Prisoner Competition. Her sculpture subjects included Sandor Vegh, Herbert Read, Helen Lessore and the artists Bernard Leach, Patrick Heron and Mary Fedden. Her sculpture Three- fold Head is in the Tate collection.

Further meetings (until 1909) were held in the offices of the Scottish Council for Women's Trades at 58 Renfield Street. Greig was, for many years president of the Glasgow Women's Liberal Association, and, along with fellow members Alice McLaren, Elizabeth Margaret Pace, Grace Paterson & Margaret Irwin (trade unionist) was also a member of the GCWT. 18 Lynedoch Crescent, Glasgow ==Activities== The organisation is considered to be a non- militant suffrage association. Their methods of influence included drawing- room meetings, addressed by prominent male and female suffragists, as well as networking with other organisations, such as The Primrose League, West of Scotland Women's Liberal Unionist Association, Scottish Women's Liberal Federation, Glasgow Council for Women's Trades & British Women's Temperance Association. The close links between the Glasgow Council for Women's Trades have been noted by Elspeth King: \\"There is no doubt that the Suffrage Society of 1902 was essentially the child of the Scottish Council for Women's Trades. The frenetic attempts of the executive committee to persuade the Countess of Aberdeen, Ishbel Hamilton-Gordon, Marchioness of Aberdeen and Temair to accept the presidency was due to the fact that she had been President of the parent body since its inception, and President of the International Council of Women since 1893.\\" The countess was unable to accept the presidency, presumably owing to her workload. Elspeth King notes that the social status of the members was a key driver of their activities. \\" [It] helped to attract the support of a succession of Liberal Lord Provosts and Town Councillors, and Members of Parliament.\\" From the earliest days, members of the organisation travelled throughout the West of Scotland, addressing meetings and facilitating the setting up of branches of the organisation, in places such as Greenock,Greenock Telegraph and Clyde Shipping Gazette Thursday 17 November 1904 Motherwell Motherwell Times Friday 13 January 1905 and Kilmacolm,Greenock Telegraph and Clyde Shipping Gazette 20 December 1906 the latter in cooperation with the Kilmacolm Women's Liberal Association. They also took their campaign with them as they travelled doon the watter to the Clyde coastal resorts, such as Helensburgh, Troon, Saltcoats, Dunoon and Rothesay. A branch of the association was established in Greenock, in 1904. In November 1907, a deputation met with the Prime Minister, Lloyd George at the North British Station Hotel. \\"He was asked by Mrs Hunter for a pledge that the Government would bring in a women's suffrage Bill before this Parliament came to the end of its career.\\" Shields Daily News 22 November 1907 During the war, the organisation suspended political campaigning, running a series of lectures instead. In the advertisements, they identified themselves as \\"non-party, non- militant\\" and \\"law-abiding\\", in order to distinguish themselves from the more militant groups, such as the Women's Social and Political Union.Daily Record Wednesday 28 October 1914Daily Record Wednesday 28 October 1914 p2 ==Evolution== After the Representation of the People Act 1918 was passed, the Association quickly moved on to promoting women candidates in local government elections. The Women's Local Representation Joint Committee was formed of a number of different organisations with similar aims. These were the Voter's Council, the Women's Educational Union, the Glasgow Women's Citizen's Association, a body formed by members of the Women's Freedom League, the National Council of Women, and the Glasgow Society for Women's Suffrage. It was chaired by Mary Anderson Snodgrass who would go on to be a Town Councillor and Bailie of the city of Glasgow.Glasgow and West of Scotland Association for Women‚Äôs Suffrage Collection, Mitchell Library, Glasgow 891036/7 This coalition of organisations had the role of a pressure group, promoting legislation favourable to women. In 1933, the societies were dissolved for financial reasons, however, the women continued to meet in Queen Margaret Union at University of Glasgow until the 1960s. ==Notable members== Members included:King, Elspeth (1980) Papers of the Glasgow and West of Scotland Association for Women's Suffrage.

Scatcherd donated Scatcherd Park to the town. ==Suffragist career== She was secretary for the Leeds branch of the National Society for Women's Suffrage (NSWS). Scatcherd was active in speaking out at events in the 1870s as typified by an example on 24 March 1877, when she appeared alongside Lydia Becker and other early suffragettes to discuss women's access to the vote in Macclesfield. The chairman, J. W. White, addressed the meeting saying that \\"it appeared somewhat strange that whereas the British Parliament had been engaged from time to time for many years back in conferring rights and removing disabilities, there should still exist any large and intelligent section of society outside the electoral community. They had not yet found any good reason given for excluding from parliamentary suffrage women who had already voted in municipal and school board elections; therefore they intended to reiterate their demands until they were conceded\\". Scatcherd was supported by Henry Birchenough in seconding the first resolution which was moved by Joshua Oldfield Nicholson.

Primaries for candidates of parties began in some states in March and would continue through September. The leaders of intelligence agencies have noted that Russia is spreading disinformation through fake social media accounts in order to divide American society and foster anti-Americanism. ==Timeline== ===February=== In February 2018 Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats claimed during a congressional testimony that \\"the United States is under attack\\" from Russian authorities. As of February 13, 2018, six US intelligence agencies unanimously assessed that Russian hackers are scanning American electoral systems and using bot armies to promote partisan causes on social media. Previously, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson also warned that Russia is interfering in the 2018 midterm election. In testimony before the Senate Intelligence Committee on February 13, Coats noted that voting in some elections will begin as early as March 2018 for primaries. He stated: \\"We need to inform the American public that this is real, that this is going to happen.\\" At the same hearing, CIA Director Mike Pompeo told the committee that Russia has already been observed engaging in such tactics. ===March=== During a press conference in the White House on March 6, 2018, President Trump was questioned on the topic of possible interference in the upcoming midterm election, responding ‚ÄúWe won‚Äôt allow that to happen.

She studied at the Chicago Art Institute after graduating from high school in 1910 with an initial focus on illustration. While there, she was among a small number of students including Stanislaus Szukalski who defended the modernist works on display at the notorious Armory Show at the Art Institute in 1913. Encouraged by her instructors she continued her art education after graduating in 1910 with honorable mention, studying portraiture with Ralph Clarkson in Chicago, painting with Charles Hawthorne in Provincetown, Massachusetts, and fine print methods with Vojtƒõch Preissig in New York's Art Students League in 1915. ==Career== By then, she was already a prolific painter and printmaker, producing striking images with saturated color and abbreviated, semi-realist imagery. One of the earliest members of the Chicago Society of Etchers, her exacting, three-plate color intaglios were first exhibited by the Society in 1914. The same year, one of her prints received an honorable mention at Panama-Pacific International Exposition in San Francisco. She held her first solo exhibition in 1916 at Goupil & Cie Gallery in New York, featured her entire collection of color aquatints. She had a studio in Chicago's 57th Street Art Colony. In the 1920s she helped form an \\"art for art's sake\\" group called the Cor Ardens along with Szukalski, Carl Hoeckner, Ramon Shiva, and Gerrit Sinclair. Traveling with friends all over the United States, Europe, and Mexico, she was by then well-known for \\"forceful painting in oils, but also for her ability to express in the exquisite art of the copper plate ‚Ä¶ an individual style through a simple and dignified treatment of her subject matter.\\" (Palos Journal, May 1929) During the Great Depression (1929-39), Levy supervised the Easel Painting Division and Art Gallery of the Illinois Art Project of the WPA. She also supervised the Easel Painting Division for the Federal Arts Project a decade later. For two years during World War II, Levy worked as a meteorological map draftsman and her subsequent work developed along more modern lines. She traveled extensively in the US, Europe, and North Africa and summered La Jolla, California for several years before making it her home in 1950. She served on the board of the San Diego Museum of Art (then the San Diego Fine Arts Gallery) and taught at the La Jolla Museum School of Arts and Crafts (1961‚Äì62). Also at the time, she began a close relationship with the modernist artist Dorothy Stratton King, a La Jolla resident with whom she shared a passion for rich color and strong form. Levy experimented heavily in her final decade in linear and highly abstract printmaking and enamels. Levy never married. After a long and distinguished career, she died in La Jolla in 1974.

He first appeared in the series twenty episode \\"Hard Day's Night\\", broadcast on 20 February 2018. Xavier arrives at Holby City hospital to work as a doctor and surgeon on the Acute assessment unit (AAU). Xavier is characterised as a \\"very confident and charming\\" doctor who sometimes lacks empathy. He is the show's \\"alpha male\\" and upon his arrival, this attitude irritates other characters. Xavier has a \\"flash\\" sense of style and Griffiths likened him to a \\"Milan catwalk model\\" rather than a doctor. Xavier wants fun and dislikes the idea of settling down. In line with his characterisation, Xavier formed a casual relationship with F1 Meena Chowdhury (Salma Hoque). He was later paired with senior staff nurse Donna Jackson (Jaye Jacobs), which developed into a serious relationship. Griffiths later remarked that Donna became Xavier's \\"lighthouse\\" who helped him resolve his issues and become a better person. Griffiths became worried that Xavier would be forever portrayed as an \\"entitled brat\\". He requested that producers create a backstory for Xavier and introduce friends and family. Writers obliged, creating an unlikely friendship with hospital porter Jason Haynes (Jules Robertson) and introduced his entire family, including his mother Nanette Duval (Suzette Llewellyn), who suffers from bipolar disorder. Griffiths left the series after two years. His final story featured a feud with CT1 Cameron Dunn (Nic Jackman). Xavier sets out to prove Cameron left surgeon Evan Crowhurst (Jack Ryder) to die in his care. Cameron ruins Xavier's career and he is killed after being hit by a bicycle and sustaining a fatal head injury. Xavier's final appearance occurred in the fourteenth episode of series 22, which was broadcast on 14 April 2020. The character was well received by critics of the genre, due to his charming persona and appearance. His departure and death were branded \\"shocking\\" and \\"biggest twist\\" of the series by various journalists. ==Casting== When Griffiths successfully auditioned for the role of Xavier he had little experience working on television, having previously opted for theatre work. He described joining a long-running series as \\"new terrain\\" and stated that he was \\"loving\\" his new role. The character first appeared in the series twenty episode \\"Hard Day's Night\\", broadcast on 20 February 2018. In April 2018, Griffiths starred in one episode of Holby City sister show, Casualty, as Xavier. Griffiths made another appearance in the show as part of a two-part crossover episode, originally broadcast in March 2019. ==Development== ===Characterisation=== Xavier is characterised as an \\"attractive and charming\\" doctor who has a \\"rakish devil- may-care attitude\\". This attitude makes Xavier struggle to make friends, but once they see his \\"charm and exuberance\\" they become more inclined to get acquainted. He is also described as having a penchant for \\"mansplaining and manspreading\\" but he would not label himself as a sexist. He likes \\"competent woman\\" but his charming attitude usually come with short-term relationships. When he arrives at the hospital Xavier wants to have fun because he is not ready to settle down with someone. Griffiths told Laura-Jayne Tyler from Inside Soap that upon his introduction, Xavier is portrayed as a \\"very confident and charming\\". He displays the typical qualities of an \\"alpha male\\" which he believed \\"rubs people up the wrong way.\\" Writers demonstrated this in his early scenes as Xavier's attitude causes tension with consultant Serena Campbell (Catherine Russell) and senior staff nurse Donna Jackson (Jaye Jacobs). Despite his overconfident persona, Griffiths did admire his work ethic. Xavier is \\"very ambitious and driven\\" but can lack empathy when patients need it most. He branded him a \\"marmite character who viewers are either going to love or hate.\\" Xavier's behaviour developed because of his childhood. Griffiths said that writers planned to explore his past but they liked to portray Xavier being secretive about his personal and family life. As Xavier is a skilled surgeon, Griffiths needed to gain experience on acting out operations to make the character appear authentic. The show's production supplied him with a life-size model of a guest character for him to practise operating on. Griffiths stated that he \\"felt a sense of big responsibility\\" even though it was a fake operation. Xavier is portrayed in stylish attire when not wearing hospital scrubs. Griffiths liked his character's \\"great clothes\\" and labelled him a \\"bit of a flash\\". He quipped that Xavier was more like a \\"Milan catwalk model\\" than a doctor. ===Family and relationships=== Xavier's reputation for not making friends is demonstrated early on in his tenure. When he meets F1 Nicky McKendrick (Belinda Owusu) in a bar, they get drunk together and she sleeps in the hospital on-call room. The following day Nicky cannot remember the events of the previous evening and asks Xavier for help. Griffiths explained that Xavier \\"enjoys winding people up\\" and refuses to help Nicky, teasing her about her behaviour. Griffiths believed that this episode \\"sets the tone of their relationship\\". Writers soon paired Xavier with Nicky's best friend, F1 Meena Chowdhury (Salma Hoque). Writers kept their relationship confined to Xavier's non-commitment rules. Griffiths told Tyler (Inside Soap) that Xavier and Meena's relationship is a \\"friends with benefits\\" arrangement. Meena is naturally \\"a lot more invested\\" in their relationship because he is a \\"ladies' man and a charmer.\\" Meena becomes jealous of Xavier's friendship with Nicky. He gives Nicky money to pay off her debts and they grow closer. When the pair are trapped in a room together, they confide in each other and Xavier tells Nicky about his brother's death. Xavier soon ends his relationship with Meena, who then accuses Nicky of having sex with her boyfriend. Griffiths was worried that Xavier would be forever portrayed as \\"an entitled brat.\\" He met with producers and requested further development of his family. Writers obliged and began to explore Xavier's backstory and family. Xavier details on-screen how he had a younger brother, Noah, who had died. It was revealed that Noah had been sent to his room for misbehaviour during Xavier's birthday party. With Xavier receiving the attention, Noah ran off and was fatally knocked down by a car. This lead Xavier to blame himself for his brother's death. Then Xavier's grandfather, Reg Thompson (Jeffery Kissoon) was admitted to AAU requiring surgery, accompanied by Xavier's brother Alex Duval (Leemore Marrett Jr.). Xavier accuses Alex of abusing their grandfather but soon realises he is mistaken. Alex refuses to accept his brother's apology and orders him to resolve his issues of Noah's death. In later episodes, Xavier's mother Nanette Duval (Suzette Llewellyn) is introduced. Nanette suffers from bipolar disorder and arrives at the hospital in a confused state. Doctors manage to find that Nanette has been overdosing on lithium. Xavier fears he may lose his job after secretly supplying his mother with the lithium. He was given a reprieve when consultant Sacha Levy (Bob Barrett) decides not to report Xavier. Xavier's father Marlon Duval (Ricky Fearon) was soon introduced into the story. Griffiths believed it was \\"amazing\\" to explore the family element of Xavier's story. He also praised Lewellyn as an \\"amazing\\" addition to Holby City. In another episode, Nanette arrives at the hospital in a confused state. Xavier is busy in an operating theatre helping consultant Ric Griffin (Hugh Quarshie). Donna fears that she has harmed someone upon discovering a blood- stained train ticket in her belongings. Marlon is then brought into AAU suffering a stab wound and requires surgery. Donna is forced to remove Xavier from the operation and he fears his father may die. Griffiths was happy that all of Xavier's family featured in the show. He told Stephen Patterson from Metro that \\"it just filled the inner life of this person that I was stepping into, and that‚Äôs kind of the bread and butter, and once you get that.\\" An unlikely friendship was scripted between Xavier and hospital porter Jason Haynes (Jules Robertson). The duo bond over a patient's care. The story begins when they witness Sian Evans (Ajjaz Awad) thrown from a vehicle in the hospital car park. Xavier and Jason go to help and discover a stab wound to her torso. Jason stems the bleeding by applying pressure with his jumper. Xavier thanks Jason for helping to save Sian, but becomes annoyed with him when he becomes fixated on helping with the rest of the case. Xavier loses his patience and angrily informs Jason that he is just a porter. Xavier discovers that Sian has a baby; she remains unconscious and the hospital are unable to locate the child. Jason makes amends and tracks down the car and successfully locates Sian's baby. Griffiths observed a good team dynamic of doctor and porter working together and said writers had planned more stories together. He believed he and Robertson worked well together, calling the experience it \\"amazing\\" and a \\"privilege\\". Soon after Xavier and Meena's break-up, producers created a new romance between Xavier and nurse Donna. Amy Johnson from the Daily Express reported that the two would become close following the advice of a patient. Donna soon realises that she has developed romantic feelings for Xavier. Writers soon developed their connection into a serious relationship. Griffiths approved of the relationship and believed that the relationship would \\"evolve\\" Xavier \\"in a completely different way.\\" The actor branded Donna a \\"lighthouse\\" in Xavier's story who helps him resolve the issues of his past. He added that \\"she was the vessel that carried him through all that and really taught him how to love and be himself and not be guarded.\\" Nanette's arrival also causes problems for their romance. Nanette takes a disliking to Donna and disapproves of her treating an injury on AAU. Nanette warned Donna that she would return to the ward and get Xavier's attention. She is readmitted with a more severe injury, which causes an argument with Xavier. The camera angles used in the scenes panned to an \\"evil\\" facial expression aimed at Donna. After their break-up, Griffiths assessed that Xavier's relationship with Donna changed his character's selfish personality. He told Patterson that Donna \\"softened him, she made him realise who he really is, and removed all the ego and the arrogance and really got to the grit of who he is.\\" ===Feud with Cameron Dunn and death=== Producers created a feud between Xavier and CT1 Cameron Dunn (Nic Jackman). He suspects that Cameron is a liar and allowed Jason to illegally perform a medical procedure in a broken lift. Cameron took the credit for saving the patient and covered for Jason. Jackman explained that Cameron \\"makes the wrong decisions\\" and Xavier sets out to expose his lies. Jason soon confirms to Xavier that he performed the procedure. Cameron had previously let abusive surgeon Evan Crowhurst (Jack Ryder) die in intensive care. When an investigation is launched into Evan's death, Xavier notices that Cameron becomes nervous. He begins to suspect that Cameron was involved and vows to expose the truth. Cameron realises that Xavier is suspicious and begins plotting against him. He makes Xavier believe that he has poisoned his coffee. Xavier confronts Cameron and he makes comments about his mental health, insinuating that he is bi-polar like his mother. Cameron's mind games lead to a violent confrontation. Xavier is subsequently suspended for attacking Cameron in the work place. After his suspension, Xavier remains fixated on ruining Cameron's career. He is called into work to face a disciplinary hearing but decides to concentrate on Cameron. Griffiths told Victoria Wilson from What's on TV that \\"Zav goes all out to bring Cameron down\\" and likened the plot to a \\"spy thriller\\" film. Griffiths added that his character actively pursues Cameron because \\"feels he's got nothing to lose\\", after losing his career and girlfriend. Xavier finds evidence off security footage that proves Cameron let Evan die. He confronts Cameron in the hospital basement and warns him that he will inform the police. Griffiths added that Cameron \\"reaches a whole new level of deception, through calculated plans and sheer luck, he manages to orchestrate Zav's downfall.\\" On his way to the police station, Cameron chases after Xavier and he is hit by a cyclist. The impact knocks Xavier over and he hits his head on the curb. Xavier later dies from his injuries and Cameron gets away with his crimes. The story formed Griffiths' departure from Holby City and he confirmed that these were his final scenes as Xavier. Xavier's departure from the show was not publicised in advance spoilers. Griffiths had to keep Xavier's departure a secret to shock viewers, which he found difficult. He told Sophie Dainty from Digital Spy that he was happy with his exit story because it was memorable. He added \\"I am all about arc; about where people start and where people finish [...] he ended up dying trying to do the right thing.\\" Producers informed Griffiths that his character would be killed off in Cameron's story. Griffiths told Patterson (Metro) that he understood why they wanted it to be Xavier. When the character was introduced he was \\"so self-involved\\" and only interested in climbing \\"the corporate ladder\\". Griffiths thought this was \\"Shakespearean tragedy\\" because Xavier died as he was finally doing something to help others, rather than himself. He likened Xavier to a \\"sacrificial lamb\\" because had he remained, Cameron's story would have concluded. The actor believed Xavier's exit story highlighted the fragility of life. He was killed by a bicycle and a \\"simple knock to the head on the kerb\\"; Griffiths thought it was important to recognise \\"something very arbitrary\\" like Xavier's accident can kill. Following his death, Xavier's organs are donated to other patients. His colleagues also perform a heart transplant using Xavier's heart. His final scene depicted the character lay dead on a mortuary slab. Griffiths found the scene upsetting to film. He revealed that he did \\"tear up\\" because \\"it was an accumulation of a lot of hours and pressure at times.\\" Xavier's death also formed a conclusion to the story with Donna. Jacobs was \\"sad\\" about Griffiths' departure and called his death a \\"big shock\\". She also felt sorry for her character having to grieve his death. Griffiths was unhappy with the ending Xavier and Donna received. He described it as a \\"big bugbear\\" that Xavier did not reconcile with her prior to death. In their last shared scene, Griffiths wanted to make their interaction more emotional. But the episode's director did not like the idea because Xavier was unaware of impending death and more concerned about exposing Cameron's lies. ==Reception== For his portrayal of Xavier, Griffiths was nominated for \\"Best Soap Newcomer\\" at the 2018 Digital Spy Reader Awards. He came in ninth place, receiving 3 per cent of the total votes. Inside Soap's Tyler branded Xavier a \\"hot new medic\\" and \\"handsome registrar\\" who made Holby City worth watching. Griffiths' colleague Hugh Quarshie believed Xavier was the \\"most fancied character\\" on the show. He also revealed that Griffiths had received nude fan mail. A Radio Times writer believed that Xavier had \\"slippery charm\\". Victoria Wilson (What's on TV) called him a \\"smooth registrar\\". The Metro's Patterson opined that Xavier was \\"the subject of some pretty incredible character development over the years.\\" Readers of entertainment website Digital Spy were not impressed with the decision decision narrative-wise to kill-off Xavier. More than 3600 readers took part in the poll with 91 per cent voting that it was the incorrect decision. Sophie Dainty from the website branded Xavier's departure Holby City's \\"biggest twist of the year\\" and a \\"shocking story\\". A reporter from Heart radio agreed it was the show's \\"biggest twist\\" and said viewers were \\"shocked\\". Charlie Milward from the Daily Express described his departure as some \\"heartbreaking scenes\\". Sasha Morris from the Daily Star branded the bikerider not reporting Cameron running from the crash scene a \\"plot hole\\". She added that fans were \\"horrified\\" and \\"devastated\\". Morris thought that Xavier's \\"turned upside down\\" by Nanette's arrival, adding that her story with Marlon \\"shocked\\" viewers. Sue Haasler from Metro stated that his death was a \\"huge shock\\". ==References== ==External links== * Xavier Duval at BBC Online Category:Holby City characters Category:Television characters introduced in 2018 Category:Male characters in television ","title":"Xavier Duval"},{"id":"56580013","text":"Ronn Pitts (1933‚ÄìSeptember 2013) was an American filmmaker who gained prominence through documenting the civil rights movement in Chicago during the 1960s and 1970s. Pitts was a native of Bronzeville, Chicago. He is most notable for having broken the color barrier in Chicago's film industry, becoming the first black filmmaker to be hired by the NFL, and the first black professor hired in the film department at Columbia College. == Career == === Film Group === Pitts' filmmaking career began as a camera assistant for the local production company the Film Group. Film Group was an active commercial company, producing advertisements for United Airlines, Kentucky Fried Chicken, Aunt Jemima, and many others. Film Group also made social documentaries, and this provided access for Pitts to meet many influential groups and figures associated with the civil rights movement. As a part of Film Group, Pitts worked on the influential American Revolution 2, a documentary covering the riots and police brutality on display at the 1968 Democratic National Convention held in Chicago. Pitts also worked with Film Group on other such notable films as The Murder of Fred Hampton (1971) documenting the assassination of the leader of the Black Panther's Illinois chapter, and Lord Thing (1970), a film depicting the Chicago gang the Conservative Vice Lords, Inc. as a positive influence in the community. === NFL === Pitts would go on to break the color barrier in the white male dominated film industry by becoming the first black filmmaker to be hired by the NFL to document the Chicago Bears for 11 years along with his friend and fellow filmmaker Joe Stratton. While working for the Bears he captured footage of Detroit Lions wide receiver Chuck Hughes' death in the final minutes of a game against the Bears in 1971.

He joined Green Archers United and scored the last goal in the team's 5‚Äì0 victory over Philippine Navy in the 2013 UFL Cup group stage. Green Archers finished third in the tournament. In the 2014 league season, Lopez Mendy played as a midfielder. On 23 January, on an assist provided by Chieffy Caligdong, he scored the second goal in a 2‚Äì2 draw with Philippine Army. He then scored on the fourth minute in an eventual 4‚Äì1 loss to Stallion on 25 February. On 22 March, he scored the Archers' first goal in a 2‚Äì1 comeback win against Loyola Meralco Sparks. In the next match, on 27 March, he scored a brace in the 2‚Äì1 victory over Team Socceroo, with the second goal scored in the 89th minute. He then scored a consolation goal in another 4‚Äì1 loss to Stallion on 10 April. He then scored a brace and registered an assist in the following match, a 4‚Äì2 win over Philippine Army. On 29 April, he scored a brace in a 2‚Äì1 win over Pasargad, with the first goal scored on the 8th minute. On 3 May, he converted the penalty to equalize 1‚Äì1 with Loyola Meralco Sparks. A month later, on 3 June, he scored a brace in the 2‚Äì0 win over Kaya. He netted another brace in the first half of their 3‚Äì0 win over Philippine Army on 19 June, their second to the last match of the season. Lopez Mendy ended the season with 15 goals. During the first UFL All-Star Weekend held on 25 April 2015, Lopez Mendy played in the Philippines vs the Rest of the World exhibition game. He was named man of the match for scoring a hat-trick in the second half as the foreigners won 5‚Äì4. In the 2015 UFL Cup group stage, Lopez Mendy scored a brace within 6 minutes of game time as the Archers defeated Pasargad 6‚Äì0 on 10 May. In their last group match against Ceres, he scored in the 3rd minute of an eventual 4‚Äì1 defeat. GAU were later eliminated in the quarter-finals. ===Kaya=== Lopez Mendy was signed by Kaya for their 2016 season. He scored a total of 11 goals in the 2016 UFL Cup, making him the tournament's top scorer as Kaya finished third. He found the net a lot that season, including a brace to help Kaya beat his former club Green Archers United 5-1. However, the Senegalese striker was sent off despite scoring Kaya's only goal to help beat Loyola Meralco 1-0, his only red card that season.https://www.spin.ph/football/ufl/news/robert-mendy-10-man-kaya-beat- loyola-meralco-ufl-football-philippines Lopez Mendy was still part of Kaya for the maiden season of the incipient Philippines Football League (PFL) in 2017. For the 2018 season, Lopez Mendy was named Player of the Season by Kaya's fan club. ===UiTM=== In January 2019 it was reported that Lopez Mendy has joined UiTM F.C. of the second-tier league Malaysia Premier League. ===Ceres‚ÄìNegros / United City=== Lopez Mendy returned to the Philippines to sign up to play for Ceres Negros of the PFL in August 2019. At the 2019 Copa Paulino Alcantara, in which his club Ceres Negros won the title, Lopez Mendy won the Golden Boot individual award for scoring five goals in the whole tournament. When Ceres Negros had a management overhaul in July 2020 and was renamed as United City, the new management re-signed Lopez Mendy to play for the club. ==Personal life== Robert Waly Lopez Mendy was born on 23 February 1987 in Dakar, Senegal. He earned a college degree in French language and literature from College Sacre Coeur in Dakar. In 2016, he married his Filipina wife, Maebel \\"Ameera\\" Ybera Lacastesantos; the couple have a son. On 3 March 2020 a Senate bill was passed initiated by Juan Miguel Zubiri to grant Lopez Mendy a Filipino citizenship through naturalization.

A Guide to the Musical Works of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. Neal Zaslaw (ed.), W.W. Norton & Company (New York, 1990). In relation to this, the periodicity in the datings of January and July/August of the years 1775 to 1777, present on the autographs of four of them, is striking. If it is true that the pieces were written as Tafelmusik for the Archbishop of Salzburg, then there must have been specific and regularly recurring events every winter and summer accounting for this pattern; so far, though, none have been found. Even though in the Anstellungsdekret f√ºr Joseph Fiala [the decree of appointment for Joseph Fiala, currently in the Landesarchiv Salzburg], issued by the Archbishop on 1 November 1778, one reads > \\"According to which we most graciously receive and welcome the supplicant > into our service, subject to his good conduct, as first oboist, in order > that the same, both in the Cathedral and at Court or elsewhere as we may > require him, should participate diligently in the music and once again bring > the wind instruments to that condition which they formerly had, so that they > can perform at our command music with wind instruments at table [...]\\"Neue > Mozart-Ausgabe, Series VII, Volume 1, p. VIII‚ÄìXIV (1984). no documents containing definite groups of musicians or concrete commissions for music have been found. The two summer datings of July and August could perhaps be linked to the semester holidays at the university at which time the students were responsible for the Finalmusik played at the summer residence of the Prince Archbishop, amongst others. For the two January dates, however, possible occasions of this kind have not been identified. The sequences of keys within the group of five is also striking: F major/B‚Äìflat major/E-flat major for K 213, 240 and 252/240a, and F major/B-flat major for K 253 and 270. This two-fold occurrence of adjacent keys in the circle of fifths suitable for wind instruments may have been conceived with something of a pedagogical intention, most likely by Leopold Mozart. The apparent absence of an additional divertimento in E-flat major to complete a set of six (the usual number needed for publication) led early musicologists, including Alfred Einstein,A. Einstein in KV3, p. 344 footnote (Leipzig, 1937). to believe that the Divertimento in E-flat major K 289/271g was also part of the set, but the latter's authenticity is now in considerable doubt (see below). Within the five works the sequence of keys throughout the movements is quite regular. The slow movements (in K 252/240a this would be the Polonaise) are in either the dominant or subdominant key, while all the others are in the principal key. The Trios of the Menuetti are in the subdominant key, except for that of K 240 which is the related minor key. The designation divertimento found on each of the autographs is in Leopold Mozart's hand. This and the fact that he numbered the pieces from I to V is a strong indication that he wanted to have the pieces printed. The five divertimenti were, however, never published during the Mozarts' lifetimes, perhaps due to the missing sixth piece. After Mozart‚Äôs death, Nissen changed the numbering fixed by Leopold and placed one of the divertimenti for ten winds, K 166/159d, in front of the sextets. Apparently, Johann Anton Andr√© was not misled by this and he published a very carefully prepared set of parts in the original order in 1801. The Neue Mozart Ausgabe (NMA) quite rightly states that the five sextets have been underestimated in both the literature and musical practice: they are seldom performed in concert programs and the relevant literature usually mentions them only briefly without any detailed examination. This underestimation is most likely mainly due to the notion that, as mere \\"table music\\", the divertimenti are musically too superficial to deserve the attention the rest of Mozart's oeuvre does. Taking into account the restricted technical capabilities of the wind instruments featured here, these divertimenti can stand comparison with the Italian string quartets from the point of view of both compositional technique and richness of invention. The rich palette of tone colours associated with the oboes, horns and bassoons actually gives these works a particular sound not found in the works for strings. In addition, Mozart's five sextets are clearly superior to the analogous productions of his contemporaries. These five divertimenti clearly comprise the second stage in Mozart's development as a composer of wind music, the first consisting of the two divertimenti for ten winds (K 186/159b and 166/159d), and the third of the large-scale serenades, K 361/370a, 375, and 388/384a, written in Vienna. The slightly gauche effects of K 186/159b and 166/159d, in which writing in thirds or sixths prevails, have been replaced in these five sextets by a greater mastery of the material which shows itself mainly in the considerably more developed independence of the six voices. Indeed, the first bassoon has been freed from its part as an additional bass instrument and has been transformed into a second solo voice. ==Divertimento in F major, K 213== The autograph is preserved in the Biblioteka Jagiello≈Ñska Krak√≥w and is dated July 1775. The work consists of the following four movements: * Allegro spiritoso * Andante * Menuetto with Trio * Contredanse en Rondeau (Molto allegro) This first sextet is the least sophisticated of the set. The Allegro spiritoso is in sonata form but the development section is quite brief. The subsequent Andante has a ternary structure and sees the first oboe paired with the first bassoon, and the second oboe briefly with the second bassoon. The Trio is a L√§ndler. The most important feature of the final Contredanse en Rondeau are the horns which are given the opportunity to shine as soloists on several occasions. ==Divertimento in B-flat major, K 240== The autograph is preserved in the Biblioteka Jagiello≈Ñska Krak√≥w and is dated January 1776. The work consists of the following four movements: * Allegro * Andante grazioso * Menuetto with Trio * Allegro The opening Allegro is more elaborate than the corresponding movement in K 213 with a fuller second subject and a recapitulation starting in the middle of the first subject; the formal repetition of the opening statement is reserved for the very end of the movement. The Menuetto is quite striking due to the droning second oboe during the opening statement and the dotted rhythms the different voices seem to be teasing each other with during the repeat of this statement. The Allegro finale is in sonata form and more rhythmic than melodic, save for the gentle C minor second subject first presented by the first oboe and then repeated, an octave lower, by the first bassoon. According to the explicit indication in the autograph the horns in K 240 are corni alti in B [high horns in B-flat]. ==Divertimento in E-flat major, K 252/240a== The autograph is preserved in the Biblioteka Jagiello≈Ñska Krak√≥w and is undated; Wolfgang Plath deduced a date \\"probably between January and August 1776\\" placing it somewhere between K 240 and 253, but its date of composition cannot be fixed more precisely than this, even with the help of calligraphic examination. The work consists of the following four movements: * Andante * Menuetto with Trio * Polonaise (Andante) * Presto assai The third divertimento in the series sets itself apart from the other four by opening with a lazy Andante in 6/8 time with an unusual number of dynamic marks. In the Menuetto the first horn is prominently brought to the foreground; the subsequent Trio is in the solemn key of A-flat major. Polonaises rarely occur in Mozart's music (an exception is a movement in the fifth divertimento of K 439b, for three basset horns); in K 252/240a the dance has an unusual swagger and a very brief coda. The brilliant Presto assai is based on the Austria tune Die Katze lasst das Mausen nicht. ==Divertimento in F major, K 253== The autograph is preserved in the Biblioteka Jagiello≈Ñska Krak√≥w and is dated August 1776. The work consists of the following three movements: * Thema mit 6 Variationen (Andante-Adagio-Allegretto) * Menuetto with Trio * Allegro assai The syncopated Andante theme of the initial movement could be a creation of Mozart himself and in the subsequent variations the composer entrusts solo tasks to all three pairs of instruments, including the horns. In the first, the first oboe present a broken-down version of the theme with limited contributions of second oboe and first bassoon. The second has the theme in the first oboe supported by a dialogue between second oboe and second bassoon in triplets. In the third, first oboe and first bassoon present the melody in octaves, while the fourth combines both oboes and both horns in the reworked theme with both bassoons in frantic 32nd-note figurations below. The fifth is the customary Adagio variation displaying a legato line and great clarity. The sixth constitutes the reprise of the Andante theme but played Allegretto: at the end of the fifth variation the autograph mentions variatio 6:ta il thema ma allegretto. The calm Trio contrasts the more noble and expressive Menuetto. The ternary Allegro assai opens with a bold unisono statement and closes with a coda. ==Divertimento in B-flat major, K 270== The autograph is preserved in the Biblioteka Jagiello≈Ñska Krak√≥w and is dated January 1777. The work consists of the following four movements: * Allegro molto * Andantino * Menuetto (Moderato) with Trio * Presto The fifth and final divertimento is the most sophisticated of the set. The Allegro molto is in full sonata form with a development section and a varied repeat in the recapitulation. The Andantino is a gavotte with a tiny but delightful three-beat canonic episode between first oboe and second bassoon at the beginning; the coda features four bars of Alberti-bass accompaniment for the first horn bringing the latter to prominence. The Menuetto carries the specific indication of moderato and features a peculiar hiccup in the second bar; the Trio is a L√§ndler. The Presto is an uncompromising 3/8 gigue featuring a brief moment of glory for the first bassoon in the coda. Although the explicit indication is missing from the autograph the horns in K 270 are corni alti in B [high horns in B-flat]. ==Divertimento in E-flat major, K 289/271g== K 289/271g comes down to us only via parts and score copies, all dating from the second half of the 19th century and attributed to Mozart, but no autograph is known. Based on its structure, however, it is highly unlikely that it was actually composed by Mozart: the decidedly obsolete writing seen from the many consecutive fifths and octaves, sometimes involving even the outer parts, the constant motion in parallel thirds and comparative lack of fantasy in the use of the horns, speaks against the authenticity of the piece.U. Toeplitz, \\"Ist das Bl√§serdivertimento in Es-dur, KV 271g/289, von Mozart?\\", Mitteilungen der Internationalen Stiftung Mozarteum 1984, 32(1‚Äì4), 51‚Äì63. The NMA presents it as a work of dubious authenticity, and, most likely for this reason, it is generally not included in performances or recordings of the set of five. ==Notable recordings== * Ensemble Zefiro: Alfredo Bernardini and Paolo Grazzi on 2-key period oboes by Bernardini & Ceccolini (1994) after Grundmann & Floth (Dresden, ca. 1790), Raul Diaz and Dileno Baldin on natural horns by Paxman (1985) after Raoux (Paris, ca. 1800) and by A.

The stories capture the lives of First Nations people who survived residential schools, individuals coping with addictions, and others overcoming loss of loved ones.

He is also the editor-in-chief of the Journal of Economic Perspectives, Research Associate at the National Bureau of Economic Research (Cambridge), and Research Fellow at the Centre for Economic Policy Research (London) and the Institute for the Study of Labor (Bonn). His research covers the fields of labor economics and urban economics. He has received several awards and honors, including the Society of Labor Economists‚Äô Rosen Prize for outstanding contributions to labor economics, the Carlo Alberto Medal, the IZA Young Labor Economist Award and a Fulbright Fellowship. Along with over 60 articles in peer-reviewed economics journals, Moretti's 2012 book for general audiences, The New Geography of Jobs, has received widespread attention. The book was described by Barack Obama in 2019 as ‚Äúa timely and smart discussion of how different cities and regions have made a changing economy work for them ‚Äî and how policymakers can learn from that to lift the circumstances of working Americans everywhere.\\" In 2018, it was described by Paul Krugman in The New York Times as ‚Äúa must reading for anyone trying to understand the state of America‚Äù and by William Galston in The Wall Street Journal as ‚Äúthe most important book of the decade on the contemporary economy.\\" The book has been translated in eight languages and was awarded the William Bowen Prize by Princeton University for the most important contribution toward understanding public policy and the labor market. Moretti‚Äôs research focuses on the growing geographic differences in economic well-being between cities. In his research, he has found that the sorting of highly educated Americans ‚Äî and high-paying jobs requiring a lot of education ‚Äî into certain communities has led to other communities falling behind. Moreover, they've been falling behind faster economically as time goes on. This pattern, in turn, has been reflected in other socioeconomic differences, including political attitudes, divorce rates and life expectancies. In addition to his work in labor economics and economic geography, Moretti has published peer-reviewed articles on the social returns to education; social interactions and peer effects; health economics; political economy; and the economics of the family. == Notable Journal Articles == * ‚ÄúHousing Constraints and Spatial Misallocation (with C.

An expert on transnational organized crime, she is the author of Seeds of Terror: How Drugs, Thugs, and Crime Are Reshaping the Afghan War. She is the executive director of the Center on Illicit Networks and Transnational Organized Crime, an operational think tank focused on the intersection between transnational organized crime and national security and the executive director of The Satao Project, a consulting firm that supports governments and industries to counter serious organized crime and corruption, and their convergence with terrorism, violence and social unrest. ==Early life and education== Peters has a BA from Harvard University and a Masters in International Relations from the University of Denver's Korbel School of International Studies. At the Korbel School, she was the recipient of the Si√© Ch√©ou-Kang security and diplomacy fellowship and the Association of Former Intelligence Officers Life's Choices Foundation Scholarship. ==Career== Peters began her career as a journalist, helping to start the newspaper The Cambodia Daily. For the following ten years, she covered Pakistan and Afghanistan, first for the Associated Press and later as a reporter for ABC News. Peters was nominated for an Emmy for her coverage of the 2007 assassination of Benazir Bhutto and won the SAJA Journalism Award for a Nightline segment on Pervez Musharraf. Peters has conducted extensive research on the intersection between transnational organized crime and national security, from drugs and money laundering to wildlife and timber trafficking. Following the publication of her book, she advised U.S. military and diplomats in Afghanistan. Peters was previously Senior Fellow on Transnational Crime at the Terrorism, Transnational Crime and Corruption Center at George Mason University, School of Public Policy. She also co-chaired an OECD Task Force working to improve policy approaches to fight the trafficking of wildlife and other environmentally sensitive goods. Peters serves on the Board of Advisors of the Center on Sanctions and Illicit Finance at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies. == Convergence == === Wildlife, Drugs, and US National Security === In 2015, Peters traveled to Africa with The Satao Project to study ivory supply chains in Tanzania and Kenya. Her work zeroed in on ‚Äúa regional ecosystem moving ivory, drugs and guns ‚Ä¶ a matrix of different organisations that collaborate to move illegal goods along the Swahili coast.‚Äù She quickly identified the underlying problem: corruption. ‚ÄúIf there‚Äôs a network that is moving illegal goods from one country to another, there are inevitably government officials involved, protecting them or looking the other way,‚Äù she said. Since then Peters has continued focus on the intersection of wildlife, narcotics, and U.S. national security interests, being cited in multiple articles, briefs, and documentaries. === Terrorism and Drug Trafficking === In 2009 Peters published Seeds of Terror: How Drugs, Thugs, and Crime Are Reshaping the Afghan War. In the book, Peters argues there is a deepening relationship between the Taliban and drug traffickers. \\"They start to look more like Tony Soprano and his guys than holy warriors,\\" Peters said in an interview with CBS News. \\"They behave like criminals. They're involved in the drugs trade, human trafficking, kidnapping, gun running‚Ä¶all sorts of criminal activity.\\" Peters spent five years researching the book, interviewing insurgents, drug kingpins, government officials, and poppy farmers. She discussed the book in a June 2009 appearance on the Daily Show with Jon Stewart. In 2010 Peters published a paper about the Haqqani network, a Pakistan-based militant group, with West Point‚Äôs Combating Terrorism Center and in 2012, Peters testified before the U.S. Congress about the Haqqani network. ==Selected publications== *Seeds of Terror: How Heroin Is Bankrolling the Taliban and al Qaeda; Thomas Dunne Books; May 12, 2009; *\\"The Curse of the Shiny Object; How Humans Fight Problems Where They Are Visible, and Why We Need to See Beyond\\"; Prism; National Defense University. * \\"Haqqani Network Financing: The Evolution of an Industry\\"; Harmony Project; Center on Combating Terrorism at West Point; October 10, 2010. * \\"How Financial Power Can Be Used to Save Iconic Species from Extinction\\"; Business Insider; April 22, 2015. *\\"Crime and Insurgency\\"; Harmony Project; October 15, 2010. * \\"Incorporation Law Enforcement Interrogation Techniques on the Battlefield\\"; CTC Sentinel: July 2009. *\\"Chapter 5: Traffickers and Truckers: Illicit Afghan and Pakistani Power Structures with a Shadowy but Influential Role\\"; Center for Complex Operations; . == References == Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Living people Category:Harvard University alumni Category:American women journalists Category:University of Denver alumni Category:Josef Korbel School of International Studies people Category:21st- century American journalists ","title":"Gretchen Peters (journalist)"},{"id":"56581532","text":"Evelyn Lord Smithson (born July 19, 1923; died March 9, 1992, in Amherst, New York)John K.

In-situ means \\"situated in the original, natural, or existing place or position.\\" An in-situ process processes data where it is stored such as in solid-state drives (SSDs) or memory devices like NVDIMM, rather than sending the data to a computer's central processing unit (CPU). The technology utilizes embedded processing engines inside the storage devices to make them capable of running user applications in-place, so data does not need to leave the device to be processed. The technology is not new, but modern SSD architecture, as well as the availability of powerful embedded processors, make it more appealing to run user applications in-place. SSDs deliver higher data throughput in comparison to hard disk drives (HDDs). Additionally, in contrast to the HDDs, the SSDs can handle multiple I/O commands at the same time. The SSDs contain a considerable amount of processing horsepower for managing flash memory array and providing a high-speed interface to host machines. These processing capabilities can provide an environment to run user applications in-place. The computational storage device (CSD) term refers to an SSD which is capable of running user applications in-place. In an efficient CSD architecture, the embedded in-storage processing subsystem has access to the data stored in flash memory array through a low-power and high-speed link. The deployment of such CSDs in clusters can increase the overall performance and efficiency of big data and high-performance computing (HPC) applications. ==Reducing data transfer bottlenecks== Webscale data center designers have been trying to develop storage architectures that favor high-capacity hosts. In the following figure (from ), such a storage system is shown where 64 SSDs are attached to a host. For the sake of simplicity, only the details of one SSD are demonstrated. Modern SSDs usually contain 16 or more flash memory channels which can be utilized concurrently for flash memory array I/O operations. Considering 512 MB/s bandwidth per channel, the internal bandwidth of an SSD with 16 flash memory channels is about 8 GB/s. This huge bandwidth decreases to about 1 GB/s due to the complexity of the host interface software and hardware architecture. In other words, the accumulated bandwidth of all internal channels of the 64 SSDs reaches the multiplication of the number of SSDs, the number of channels per SSD, and 512 MB/s (bandwidth of each channel) which is equal to 512 GB/s. While the accumulated bandwidth of the SSDs‚Äô external interfaces is equal to 64 multiply by 1 GB/s (the host interface bandwidth of each SSD) which is 64 GB/s. However, In order to talk to the host, all SSDs required to be connected to a PCIe switch. Hence, the available bandwidth of the host is limited to 32 GB/s. Modern SSD architecture and the data transfer bottleneck in storage servers Overall, there is a 16X gap between the accumulated internal bandwidth of all SSDs and the bandwidth available to the host. In other words, for reading 32 TB of data, the host needs 16 minutes while internal components of the SSDs can read the same amount of data in about 1 minute. Additionally, in such storage systems, data need to continuously move through the complex hardware and software stack between hosts and storage units, which imposes a considerable amount of energy consumption and dramatically decreases the energy efficiency of large data centers. Hence, storage architects need to develop techniques to decrease data movement, and ISP technology has been introduced to overcome the aforementioned challenges by moving the process to data. ==Efficiency and utilization== The computational storage technology minimizes the data movements in a cluster and also increases the processing horsepower of the cluster by augmenting power-efficient processing engines to the whole system. This technology can potentially be applied to both HDDs and SSDs; however, modern SSD architecture provides better tools for developing such technologies. The SSDs which can run user application in-place are called computational storage devices (CSDs). These storage units are augmentable processing resources, which means they are not designed to replace the high- end processors of modern servers. Instead, they can collaborate with the host‚Äôs CPU and augment their efficient processing horsepower to the system. The scientific article ‚ÄúComputational storage: an efficient and scalable platform for big data and HPC applications‚Äù which is published by Springer Publishing under open access policy (free for the public to access) shows the benefits of CSD utilization in the clusters. Examples of in-storage processing can be seen in fields like visualization efforts, biology and chemistry. This showcases how this technology allows for actions and results to be seen more efficiently than through data movement, regardless of the data being moved. The following figures (from ) show how CSDs can be utilized in an Apache Hadoop cluster and on a Message Passing Interface-based distributed environment. CSD-equipped Hadoop cluster CSD-equipped MPI-based cluster ==Industry== In the storage industry, implementations from several companies are now available, including from NGD Systems, ScaleFlux and Eideticom. Other companies have tried to do similar work in the past, including Micron Technology and Samsung. The approach from all of these are the same direction, managing or processing data where it resided. NGD Systems was the first company to create in-situ processing storage and has produced two versions of the device since 2017. The Catalina-1 was a standalone SSD that offered 24 TB of flash along with processing. A second product called Newport was released in 2018 that offered up to 32 TB of flash memory. ScaleFlux uses a CSS-1000 NVMe device that uses host resourcing and kernel changes to address the device and use Host resources to manage up to 6.4 TB flash on the device, or base SSD. Eideticom utilizes a device called a No-Load DRAM-only NVMe device as an accelerator with no actual flash storage for persistent data. Micron called their version ‚ÄòScale In‚Äô at a Flash Memory Summit (FMS) event in 2013 but was never able to productize it and was based on a SATA SSD in production. Samsung has worked on various versions of devices from KV Store and others. == References == Category:Data storage ","title":"In-situ processing"},{"id":"56581597","text":"Giovanni Ottavio Bufalini (17 January 1709, in Citt√† di Castello ‚Äì 3 August 1782) was an Italian cardinal.

In 2008, Saarinen‚Äôs daughter Eve was born with an undetected critical congenital heart defect (CCHD). Although Saarinen's newborn daughter was in heart failure at 2 days old, she was nearly discharged without a diagnosis and survived two heart surgeries in the first months of life.Kristina Crane, \\"Sent Home Too Soon? The Difficult Art of Hospital Discharge\\", U.S. News, Jan 29, 2015 This experience inspired Saarinen to create the Newborn Foundation  Coalition and launched the country‚Äôs first multi-hospital newborn heart screening pilot in collaboration with a state department of health, with the purpose of making CCHD screening a standard of care in the United States. As a result, the screening was added to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Routine Uniform Screening Panel (RUSP) and all 50 states including the District of Columbia have adopted universal screening. Approximately 4 million U.S. newborns each year are now being screened for heart defects using pulse oximetry. ==Professional Background == Ananamarie Saarinen In 2016, Saarinen was appointed by the U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services under the Obama Administration to the federal Advisory Committee on Heritable Disorders in Newborns and Children (ACHDNC). She has helped draft more than 40 pieces of health legislation, authored more than 200 policy briefings and co-authored numerous published manuscripts on the importance of advancing early detection and treatment of neonatal and pediatric health conditions. Under her leadership, the BORN Project was selected as one of only 24 global innovation projects from around the world addressing the UN Sustainable Development Goals addressing human rights, health equity and innovation. The work of the UN Solutions Summit cohort was co-convened by the White House and the United Nations in collaborations with the Brazilian Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation, the Kenyan Ministry of Technology, the Estonian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Government of Norway, the Government of Fiji and the Global Innovation Exchange. Thus far, the BORN project has provided neonatal pulse oximetry screening training and implementation, and a data collection framework for more than 1,200 health workers, expanding its screening cohort to nearly 300,000 newborns across 200 delivery sites in 10 low and middle-income countries. It was also among the first formal public/private sector commitments to reduce preventable newborn mortality as part of the UN Secretary General's Every Woman, Every Child initiative. ==Newborn Foundation  Coalition== 310x310px In 2011, under Saarinen's leadership, the Newborn Foundation  Coalition successfully lobbied the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to include pulse-oximetry testing for CCHDs in their universal screening recommendations. As a result, all 50 states including the District of Columbia adopted these federal recommendations - known as the Routine Uniform Screening Panel (RUSP), with roughly 4 millions U.S. newborns now being screened each year for CCHDs using pulse oximetry. Saarinen is leading the BORN project, a global health initiative leveraging pulse oximetry technology to combat neonatal mortality. The project is a targeted education-and-implementation initiative with the goal of bringing low-cost, effective screening tools, technologies and protocols to remote and resource-poor settings to earlier diagnose and treat medically fragile infants. To date, the foundation has worked in 16 countries, screening hundreds of thousands of newborns in its project portfolio, leading to formal newborn screening policies in China, Mongolia, the Philippines, India, and Mexico. In 2016, the Newborn Foundation was among the first investment grants from London-based Global Innovation Fund (GIF), supported the Department of International Development in the UK; the United States Agency for International Development (USAID); the Omidyar Network; the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency; and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (Australia). The grant was used to expand the BORN Project, and bring low-cost, mobile-app based pulse oximetry technology to 93,000 newborns for earlier detection and access to treatment for life-threatening, but treatable health conditions. In 2018, the Newborn Foundation developed Find Pneumonia Sooner - a set of resources to help drive adoption of screening and diagnostic tools to reduce childhood pneumonia deaths as the single biggest killer of children globally. The initiative supports the Newborn Foundation‚Äôs role as a founding partner of the Every Breath Counts Coalition, a global public-private partnership to support national governments to end preventable child pneumonia deaths by 2030, and was part of a project funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. In 2019, The Newborn Foundation and co-founder Annamarie Saarinen were selected as 2019 #Give16 Honors recipients, presented by the 3M Open and honoring 16 individuals and organizations for outstanding impact in the community. The award also helped raise funds for programs at the University of Minnesota Masonic Children‚Äôs Hospital, a Newborn Foundation partner research center. == Awards and Recognitions == Saarinen is the recipient of the Betty Hubbard Maternal and Child Health Leadership Award and the Patient Safety, Science and Technology Humanitarian Award, a distinction also held by Vice President Joe Biden, UK Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt, and U.S. Senator Barbara Boxer. Saarinen is a Humphrey Policy Fellow, has been an adjunct lecturer at 5 international medical colleges, and serves as an advisor to UNICEF and the WHO in creating technical specifications for oxygen therapy and monitoring devices. == References == Category:1960 births Category:Living people Category:American activists ","title":"Annamarie Saarinen"},{"id":"56581793","text":"The Anderson Style Shop, at 222 Main St. in Kalispell, Montana, was built in 1941.

It is notable for being able to tolerate the most extreme body temperature range of any known mammal. ==Taxonomy== It was initially described in 1884 by Swedish zoologist Dr. Wilhelm Leche. Leche had acquired a collection of specimens from Gustav Schneider, a Swiss natural history dealer, and used to describe a new species that was distinguishable from the rest of the series. In 1906, Oldfield Thomas published a paper in which he considered N. petersi as synonymous with an earlier description of species Mormopterus planiceps (Ozimops planiceps, in part). This status was largely maintained until 2014, although greater diversity had previously been identified, when a study examining the morphology and genetics of the bats of Australia showed that it was distinct enough to be considered a full species. This description removed the name from a synonymy of M. planiceps, publishing a subgeneric arrangement Mormopterus (Ozimops) petersi before that was elevated to genus Ozimops. Leche initially placed it in the now defunct genus Nyctinomus with the species name petersi. While Leche did not state the eponym for the species name \\"petersi\\", it is possible that it was named in honor of Wilhelm Peters, a German naturalist who described several species and genera of bats and had died a year prior to Leche's publication in 1884. ==Description== In describing the species, Leche noted that it is similar in appearance to the east-coast free-tailed bat, Mormopterus norfolkensis. He wrote that it differs in its flat, compressed skull. It is a small species of bat, with a head and body length of , a tail length of , and a forearm length of . The tail extends approximately past the edge of the uropatagium. Its tragus is tiny, at only long. It weighs . ==Biology== Ozimops petersi is nocturnal species, roosting in sheltered places during the day such as tree cavities or under metal roofs. Females have one breeding season annually, and give birth in November or December. The litter size is generally one individual, with the young called a \\"pup.\\" This species of bat can tolerate the most extreme range of body temperatures of any known mammal. Its body temperature has been recorded as low as and as high as . This upper limit even exceeds recorded maximum body temperatures of camels. These bats can survive these otherwise lethal extremes by using torpor, which is a physiological adaptation. ==Conservation== As of 2020, it is listed as least concern by the IUCN--its lowest conservation priority. It meets the criteria for this assessment because it has a large geographic range; it tolerates a variety of habitats; its population size is thought to be large; and it is documented regularly throughout its range. Its population may exceed one million individuals, although this number may be declining. ==References== Category:Mammals described in 1884 Category:Bats of Australia Category:Ozimops ","title":"Ozimops petersi"},{"id":"56581945","text":"Brachybacterium massiliense is a species of Gram positive bacterium.

This earned her the right to represent her country at the Eurovision Song Contest 2018. On 12 May 2018, she won the contest, held in Lisbon, Portugal, with her song \\"Toy\\", marking Israel's fourth win in the Eurovision Song Contest (after 1978, 1979, and 1998). ==Early life== Barzilai (far left) with members of an Israeli Navy band in 2014. Barzilai was born in Hod HaSharon, Israel, to a Jewish-Georgian family. Her mother is from a Maghrebi Jewish family (of Moroccan-Jewish and Libyan-Jewish descent), whereas her father is from an Ashkenazi Jewish family (of Polish-Jewish descent). As a child, Barzilai lived in Nigeria for four years, where her father, who is an engineer, worked on a project for Israeli company Solel Boneh.http://embassies.gov.il/abuja/NewsAndEvents/Pages/Look-at-her-Israels- representative-is-favored-to-win-Eurovision-2018.aspx Barzilai attended Hadarim High School in Hod HaSharon and was a counselor at an Israeli youth movement HaNoar HaOved VeHaLomed. Prior to her military service in the Israel Defense Forces, she spent a Service Year volunteering in the paramilitary Nahal. She completed her military service in the Israeli Navy Band. Afterwards, she studied electronic music at the Rimon School of Jazz and Contemporary Music, however she did not complete a degree there. ==Music career== In September 2017, Barzilai auditioned for season five of HaKokhav HaBa, Israel's national selection for the Eurovision Song Contest, with \\"Rude Boy\\" by Rihanna. After receiving 82% of the votes, she advanced to the second stage of the competition in which she sang \\"Hey Mama\\" by David Guetta. In February 2018, she performed \\"Wannabe\\" by the Spice Girls, and although she lost a duel to Ricky Ben Ari, she proceeded to the next stage after being selected by the judges. The last song Barzilai performed in the competition was a mashup of \\"Gangnam Style\\" by Psy and \\"Tik Tok\\" by Kesha. After receiving 210 points from the judges and audience, Barzilai won first place and the right to represent Israel at Eurovision. ===Eurovision Song Contest 2018=== Barzilai at a press conference after qualifying for the final of the 2018 Eurovision Song Contest On 25 February 2018, it was reported that the song that Barzilai would perform at the Eurovision Song Contest was called \\"Toy\\" and that it would be performed in English, apart from a phrase in Hebrew. The song was written and composed by Doron Medalie and Stav Beger, and produced by Berger. The song was released on 11 March 2018, and its music video went on to receive more than 20 million views two months before the beginning of Eurovision. On 14 April 2018, Barzilai performed her song at Eurovision in Concert in Amsterdam, the largest Eurovision promotional event. Four days later, she performed the song Hora Heachzut at the torch-lighting ceremony that opened the celebrations of the 70th Anniversary of the Establishment of the State of Israel.

After Kent County Council‚Äôs order to maintain public access was appealed by Mr. Steel, a public enquiry followed, which ruled in the villagers‚Äô favour and confirmed the status of the paths as public rights of way. Since 2019, concerns have been raised by local residents regarding the ownership and management of the woodland, after Woodlands.co.uk acquired land in Pitt and Oxenden Woods. A public meeting was held in September 2019, where the possible impact of Woodlands.co.uk's practices of woodland lotting ‚Äì the selling of woodland in small chunks ‚Äì was discussed, and a recommendation was made to retain management of the woodland as a whole.

This theory was challenged by Lawrence Lessig, who argued that in case of cyberspace the code may be considered as another way of regulation and therefore the cyberspace may be treated more widely than just another area of relations regulated by conventional legal principles.https://cyber.harvard.edu/works/lessig/finalhls.pdf Employing more liberal approach the DLT law may mean the body of law \\"characterized by a set of rules administered through self-executing smart contracts and decentralized (and potentially autonomous) organizations\\". == Areas of law == As of the beginning of 2018 the DLT law does not constitute a separate field of law rather it encompasses aspects of corporate, contract, investment, banking and finance law. According to conservative approach the DLT law may be considered as a part of existent area of law, which may be applied to regulate different aspects of DLT use and new kind of legal relations on blockchain, such as issue of authorisation (electronic signature), admissibility of blockchain evidence in court, status of cryptocurrency and regulation of initial coin offering, use of smart contracts, status of DAO (decentralized autonomous organization) and other. == Status of blockchain-based records and smart contracts == While in the UK and the EU at the beginning of 2018 the legislators are still silent about blockchain technology, in the United States several states already enacted legislation providing a framework for business and legal application of blockchain technology and enforceability of smart contracts. ===Vermont === On 2 June 2016 Vermont became the first state, which recognised blockchain-based records having legal bearing in a court under the Vermont Rules of Evidence and defined blockchain technology as \\"mathematically secured, chronological, and decentralized consensus ledger or database, whether maintained via Internet interaction, peer-to-peer network, or otherwise\\"https://legislature.vermont.gov/assets/Documents/2016/Docs/ACTS/ACT157/ACT157%20As%20Enacted.pdf ===Arizona === In March 2017, Arizona‚Äôs Electronic Transactions Act (the AETA) was amended by HB 2417 Act to clarify that ‚Äúelectronic records, electronic signatures, and smart contract terms secured through blockchain technology and governed under UCC Articles 2, 2A and 7 will be considered to be in an electronic form and to be an electronic signature under AETA.‚Äù HB 2417 Act also provides a definition of blockchain technology as a ‚Äúdistributed, decentralized, shared and replicated ledger, which may be public or private, permissioned or permissionless, or driven by tokenized crypto economics or tokenless‚Äù and definition of smart contract as \\"event driven program, with state, that runs on a distributed, decentralized, shared and replicated ledger that can take custody over and instruct transfer of assets on that ledger\\". The State also identifies areas where blockchain technology should not be used. For instance, the new law adopted in 2017 prohibits the use of blockchain technology to locate or control firearms.Craig de Ridder, Mercedes Tunstall, Nathalie Prescott, 'Recognition of smart contracts in the United States' (2017) Intellectual Property and Technology Law Journal Vol 29 No 11. === Nevada === In June 2017 similar legislation has been enacted in Nevada. In addition, Nevada was the first state to ban local governments from taxing the use of \\"blockchain\\". With regard to the definition of blockchain, the Nevada Senate defines it as \\"an electronic record created by the use of a decentralized method by multiple parties to verify and store a digital record of transactions which is secured by the use of a cryptographic hash of previous transaction information\\".https://www.leg.state.nv.us/Session/79th2017/Bills/SB/SB398.pdf === Delaware === On August 1, 2017, Delaware's blockchain law became effective, which amends the Delaware General Corporation Law explicitly permitting the use of distributed ledger technology in the administration of Delaware corporate records, including records of stock and stockholders. \\"Before this new law was adopted, there was nothing specifically stopping a Delaware corporation from using blockchain technology to keep track of its stockholders, but there was also a great deal of regulatory uncertainty.\\" ===Illinois=== On January 31, 2018, Illinois regarded its role in the development of the blockchain ecosystem as one which \\"supports the distinct needs of the respective ecosystem stakeholders: entrepreneurs, capital providers, developers, governments, and academics to support and encourage the creation and growth of 15 blockchain companies in Illinois.\\" To accomplish this mission the Illinois Blockchain Initiative created the role of the State of Illinois Blockchain Business Liaison, which is responsible for the engagement of these stakeholders within the ecosystem to identify and conclusively work to resolve their respective needs. Over the past year, the Illinois Blockchain Initiative has compiled a database of over 200 blockchain and distributed ledger technology pilots, projects and strategies announced by public sector entities. The database is an overview of how government at various levels globally 29 are employing blockchain technology in their efforts to govern, improve the competitiveness of their economy and also deliver high-quality services in a more efficient manner. The public sector is one of the most active blockchain sector‚Äôs exploring the technology for a wide variety of use cases. Adoption of the technology in the public section is accelerating at an extraordinary pace. == DLT and law issues == === Issue of situs and place for dispute resolution === In the legal context DLT and smart contracts are distinct and face their own problems and challenges. Issue of situs is an example which relates to DLT rather than smart contracts. International private law and legislation of various jurisdictions require to identify the location of an asset or place of an agreement in order to solve conflict of law problem and determine the applicable governing law. \\"However, the distribution of the register across nodes in multiple jurisdictions raises a seemingly intractable problem ‚Äì under current legal principles at least ‚Äì as to where the situs should be.\\" Holding something on DLT, including smart contract or title to an asset, does not isolate it from the legal system and laws of respective jurisdiction. \\"Some blockchain enthusiasts may have misinterpreted the statement ‚Äòcode is law‚Äô as implying that code can supersede the law or that decentralised networks create their own legal regimes.\\"Eliza Mik, ‚ÄòSmart contracts: terminology, technical limitations and real world complexity‚Äù (2017) Law Innovation and Technology Vol 9 No 2, 269. In case of a dispute between the parties of the smart contract within the DLT, the issue arises where the distributed ledger is located in order to determine the place for dispute resolution.Reggie O'Shields, 'Smart Contracts: Legal Agreements for the Blockchain' (2017) North Carolina Banking Institute Vol 21, 177. \\"Blockchain also poses questions concerning the ability to identify the parties to a transaction, to the extent a system utilizing this technology remains anonymous, which may rise a host of additional issues related to dispute resolution.\\" === Issue of legal validity and update of code on DLT === An absence of legal compliance mechanism on DLT, self-executing nature of code on DLT and limited ability to update the code if the law changes create a number of legal issues. There are several possible solutions of addressing these issues. \\"One method could be a system in which the relevant jurisdiction creates a publicly available database and application programming interface (API) of relevant legal provisions. These would be provisions related to the terms of the contract. The smart contract would call these terms and would be able to update those provisions terms in accord with the jurisdiction's update of the database.\\"Max Raskin, ‚ÄòThe Law and Legality of Smart Contracts‚Äô (2017) 1 Geo L Tech Rev 305. On more conservative side of DLT and law interaction spectrum are two solutions proposed by Alexander Savelyev: \\"(1) To introduce the concept of a ‚ÄòSuperuser‚Äô for government authorities, which will have a right to modify the content of Blockchain databases in accordance with a specified procedure in order to reflect the decisions of state authority. (2) To enforce decisions of state authorities in ‚Äòoffline‚Äô mode by pursuing the specific users and forcing them to include changes in Blockchain themselves as well as by using traditional tort claims, unjust enrichment claims, and specific performance claims.\\"Alexander Savelyev, 'Contract law 2.0: ‚ÄòSmart‚Äô contracts as the beginning of the end of classic contract law' (2017) Information & Communications Technology Law Vol 26 No 2, 116. === Issue of automation of smart contracts and 'Oracles' === To facilitate the self-execution, a smart contract needs access to sources of event information through which the execution of its terms and conditions is assessed. \\"In the interest rate swap example, the distributed ledger must have access to assets of the parties' in order to fulfil the parties' payment obligations, and it must have access to a provider of interest rate information.\\"Jenny Cieplak and Simon Leefatt, 'Smart contracts: A smart way to automate performance' (2017) 1 Geo L Tech Rev 417. The solutions to the issue of access to assets vary and may be solved through locking and release of assets in smart contract as it is performed through use of cryptocurrency Ether on Ethereum blockchain or by introducing new mechanism of access to assets like 'cash states' proposed by Corda distributed ledger.https://docs.corda.net/_static/corda-technical-whitepaper.pdf The solution to the issue of access to information may require use of so-called 'Oracles' - an external party (or a machine) providing the judgement to determine whether or not respective conditions under the agreement have been met. \\"Turning again to the interest rate swap example, an oracle could be used to provide interest rate information on a payment calculation date. The oracle's digital signature would be retained on the distributed ledger so that parties could review the payment process and confirm that payments were made correctly.\\" == References == Category:Law by issue Category:Blockchain entities Category:Government by algorithm ","title":"Distributed ledger technology law"},{"id":"56582289","text":"The ambassador's residence, seen from Iconsiam The Embassy of Portugal in Bangkok is the diplomatic mission of Portugal in Thailand. It is located in Bang Rak District, on the eastern bank of the Chao Phraya River, and is served by Soi Charoen Krung 30 (also known as Captain Bush Lane). Dating to 1820, with the ambassador's residence built in 1860, it is the oldest diplomatic mission in Thailand, and the ambassador's residence has been recognized as an award-winning historic building. The current Ambassador is Mr. Francisco Patto. ==History== Portugal was the first European nation to come into contact with Siam in the 16th century, during the time of the Ayutthaya Kingdom. The Portuguese were granted land near the capital, and a sizeable community settled in Siam. Following the Fall of Ayutthaya in 1767 and the subsequent establishment of Thonburi and Rattanakosin as Siam's successor kingdoms, the Portuguese resettled in the new capitals, in the area of today's Bangkok. In 1786, as thanks for Portugal's assistance in the Nine Armies' War against the Burmese, King Rama I granted a piece of land to Portugal, which would be used for the establishment of the Holy Rosary Church. The King also promised land for a factory (trading post), should the Portuguese wish to establish one. This was realised in 1820, during the reign of King Rama II. A piece of land on the river, not far from the church, was granted to the Portuguese Consul- General, Carlos Manoel da Silveira. The land, 72 wa (fathoms) along the waterfront and 50 wa wide, with two shipyards, had been the former residence of the Vietnamese Emperor Gia Long during his time in exile in Siam. The legation in 1918 The original building, of bamboo and wood, was replaced by a masonry structure, the construction of which began in 1860. Plans were made for materials to be shipped in from Goa, but the ship was wrecked during the journey and local materials had to be used instead. Interruptions and delays led to construction being suspended in 1867. By 1875, the unfinished structure had deteriorated, and the consulate hired Italian-Austrian architect Joachim Grassi to rebuild it within a time frame of five months. The construction cost 10,000 Mexican dollars. The building was inaugurated by Consul Antonio Feliciano Marques Pereira, and has since served as the residence of the consul, and later of the ambassador, following the consulate's elevation to embassy status. By this time, Charoen Krung Road had been built, and the embassy would come to be served by the side-street known as Captain Bush Lane. Other foreign missions, including those of Britain and France, would also be established nearby, and the area became a centre of the European expatriate community during the turn of the 19th‚Äì20th centuries. ==Architecture== The Ambassador's residence is a two-storey building built in Colonial style. The floor plan is rectangular, with a central front porch and gable projecting from the hipped roof demonstrating Neo-Palladian influence. The front fa√ßade, which faces the river, features a loggia running the entire length of the lower floor. On the upper floor, the central porch has three arched windows, divided by pilasters, above which the coat of arms of Portugal decorates the gable. The entrance, decorated with ceramic tiles from Portugal, opens into a large hall, which is a few steps lower than outside ground level due to subsidence and subsequent raising of the exterior grounds to prevent flooding. The lower floor previously contained offices, which have been relocated to a separate building, and now hosts a reception room. A prison cell, used in the days of extraterritoriality, also used to be located in the basement. A staircase leads up to a central hall on the upper floor, which grants access to all rooms, including the bedroom, sitting room, and small and large dining rooms. Verandas line the front and the rear of the upper floor. The building has undergone multiple changes, renovations and restorations, including the installation of electricity and air conditioning during the 20th century, and most recently in 2013 to bring the building closer to its original state. The original teak, used for structural beams and upper-level flooring, remains intact. The building is the oldest diplomatic residence in Bangkok, and received the ASA Architectural Conservation Award in 1984. Among the decorative objects in the residence are a pair of carved wooden doors from at least the 18th century, which had been brought from the original Portuguese settlement in Ayutthaya. Several bronze cannons guard the entrance to the residence. A former warehouse, part of the historical factory or feitoria, now serves as the chancery. It underwent major renovations in 2004, with contributions by Portuguese architects and engineers. Retaining the original wooden structural work, metal and glass now frame the modern and \\"chic\\" offices, as well as the Portuguese Cultural Center's classroom, library and resources centre on the lower floor. A third building contains staff residences. The embassy has relatively large grounds and gardens, part of which it leases to the next-door Royal Orchid Sheraton Hotel for the hotel's swimming pool and tennis courts. Flood walls along the riverbank and pumps are needed to protect the compound from the river. In 2017, a mural was installed on the walls of the embassy by Portuguese street artist Vhils, as part of his Scratching the Surface series. The project, sponsored by the embassy, was part of an effort to promote the surrounding neighbourhood as Bangkok's Creative District, led by the Thailand Creative and Design Center. ==Operations== The Portuguese embassy in Bangkok is a relatively small diplomatic mission. , it has seven members of staff. The Portuguese Ambassador to Thailand is also accredited to Myanmar, Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam and Malaysia. The embassy works on supporting the small community‚Äîof about 1,000 people‚Äîof Portuguese nationals in Thailand, as well as promoting bilateral relations in culture, commercial activity, tourism and academia. ==See also== * Portugal‚ÄìThailand relations ==References== ==External links== * Category:Portugal‚ÄìThailand relations Bangkok Portugal Category:Bang Rak District Category:ASA Architectural Conservation Award recipients Category:Buildings and structures on the Chao Phraya River ","title":"Embassy of Portugal, Bangkok"},{"id":"56582300","text":"Demmin is a surname, which may be derived from Demmin, Germany.

She was scrapped in 1984 in Ashtabula, Ohio. Willis L. King is best known for her collision with the steamer on August 20, 1920, in Whitefish Bay. ==History== In 1906 the Jones and Laughlin Steel Company commissioned two freighters named and , both named after the founders of the large company, and both were built by the Great Lakes Engineering Works of Ecorse, Michigan. The large fleet was managed by W.H. Becker, a prominent fleet manager and owner from Cleveland, Ohio. Due to the increasing demand for iron ore, J & L commissioned two identical vessels; Willis L. King from the Great Lakes Engineering Works (GLEW) of Ecorse, Michigan, and the from the American Ship Building Company (AMSHIP) of Lorain, Ohio. They were identical in every respect and had a length of and a 12,000-ton cargo capacity. Willis L. Kings keel was laid on September 12, 1910; slightly over three months later she was launched on December 17, 1911 as hull number #79. She was commissioned by the Interstate Steamship Company (W.H. Becker, Mgr.) of Cleveland, Ohio (a subsidiary of Jones and Laughlin Steel Company). She entered service on April 18, 1911, sailing light from Ecorse, Michigan, bound for Toledo, Ohio. ==Superior City disaster== On August 20, 1920 Willis L. King had just unloaded a cargo of iron ore at Ashtabula, Ohio, and was on her way to the ore docks to pick up another load of ore. Meanwhile, was downbound from Two Harbors, Minnesota, heavily loaded with 7,600 tons of iron ore in her cargo hold. Noted Great Lakes maritime historian and author Dwight Boyer described the collision between the two ships in his book Ships and Men of the Great Lakes. He wrote: > \\"She was [R]ammed on her port side, aft of midships ‚Ä¶ [causing] ‚Ä¶ a > tremendous explosion when the terrible inrushing wall of cold water burst > her aft bulkheads and hit the boilers.

The Castle-class trawler was originally built in 1920 for the United Kingdom Admiralty as the Thomas Alexander, and served most of its life as a trawler in French and English fisheries. It was renamed as Ben Dearg in 1936 and was requisitioned as a minesweeper in World War II in 1939 by the British Admiralty. The iron hulled trawler arrived in Albany in 1949. The single screw steamer was coal burning, with a single ended boiler that generated 180lbs. per square inch of pressure of steam. Both Ben Dearg and the sister vessel Commiles were considered to be obsolete and unsuitable for fishing in the Great Australian Bight by 1951, and were looking for fishing grounds closer to Albany which they could trawl safely. An attempt was made to sell the vessel by Anglo-Australian Fisheries Limited in February 1954. Following the liquidation of Anglo-Australian Fisheries Limited, the trawler was sold to Krasnostein and Company, a company based in Perth, in June 1954. It was advertised later in the year for ¬£8000.

The bridge's original Pratt through main span was replaced by a steel girder span in 2009-10. ==Description and history== South Dakota Department of Transportation Bridge No. 63-210-282 was located about west and south of Centerville, carrying 461st Avenue over the East Fork Vermillion River just north of 296th Street. It was a three-span structure, with timber-framed approach spans on either side of a central Pratt through truss. The main span was , and rested on steel tubular piers, while the outermost supports were timber crib abutments. The truss elements were riveted together, and the bridge's deck support consisted of two layers of wooden planking set on timber beams laid over steel I-beams, which were riveted to hangar plates on the trusses. The bridge was built in 1909 by the Iowa Bridge Company of Des Moines, Iowa. The county had a contract with that company to provide its steel truss bridges between 1905 and 1911, apparently as part of a common but illegal practice of \\"pooling\\", in which companies divided the state into areas where they did not compete against one another.

He draws and colors and animates his work, in spite of being legally blind, with 3% vision in one eye and none in the other. ==Career== Richard‚Äôs works are best known in New Zealand and Australia where he has over 200 published titles. His comic series Blastosaurus (2008) became widely known in New Zealand when it was launched as the first locally produced monthly comic title. His picture books for children have been published all over the world by multiple publishers including Scholastic, Penguin/Random House and Sky Pony Press. Richard was born in Auckland New Zealand and lived there until he was 31, with brief stints in Australia in his early 20s. His mother was a high school teacher. Richard learnt to read and write by the time he was 3 and immediately began making books in his spare time. When Richard was seven he wrote his first comic book. Once again it featured a ghost being lonely and sad, but this time it was an original character - Ghost Ghost. Richard completed the book and had it photocopied at his school library, and sold at a school athletics day. Over the next decade Richard continued to produce comics, but rarely released any of them. In 2001 Richard was part of the inaugural Class Comedians program as part of the NZ International Comedy Festival. Richard had never performed stand up before, but found his dry sense of humor and flat performance worked far better on stage than it did in person. He won one of the awards from the program and went on to perform stand up semi regularly through college, appearing occasionally on TV and being featured in a documentary focused on how terrible the quality of comedy had become in New Zealand. It was through this that Richard was able to take his comic production to the next level, using his minor fame to get sponsorship and sell advertising in his books, allowing him to go suddenly from print runs of a few hundred to a few thousand. It was in 2002 that Richard first started selling his books at the Armageddon Expo. Over the next 16 years Richard had booths at over 200 shows in New Zealand and Australia, as well as being a guest at San Diego Comic Con and the London Film and Comic Con in 2010 and 2012 respectively. Richard graduated in 2007, with a Bachelor of Fine Arts from the Elam School of Fine Arts and a Post Graduate Diploma in Secondary Teaching from the University of Auckland, he took the summer to direct a self funded feature film. In 2010 Richard was flown to San Diego Comic Con to launch Blastosaurus under the American Original imprint of Top Cow Comics, but the book was misprinted by the publisher. The mis-printed version was not released and Richard went home to relaunch the comic in New Zealand instead, through his company Square Planet Comics. In 2012, Blastosaurus was relaunched in New Zealand, this time with Terry Jones contributing as a part time co- writer. The title quickly gained a much larger audience, selling well through bookstores, comic stores, to libraries and schools, as well as through conventions and online. Over the next 5 years, Blastosaurus remained the highest selling New Zealand comic, selling thousands of copies of every volume, as well as convention specials, activity books, spinoff comic strips and even a toy. By the time Richard left New Zealand and shut down his publishing efforts there, there were over 50 Blastosaurus titles available, none of which still in their first printing. In 2017 Richard moved to Los Angeles to pursue a career in comics outside of the tiny New Zealand market. Blastosaurus has been picked up by Golden Apple Books, restarting the series from scratch with his new collaborator Paul Eiding (known for his acting work in video games and television). The series will launch in March 2018 at WonderCon, then become a monthly series later in the year. ==Selected Works== * If I had an Elephant * That's Not the Monster We Ordered * My Grandpa is a Dinosaur (1960) * Gorillas in Our Midst * Morgan, the Moreporks, and the Moon * Morgan Goes to Nowhere * Morgan Goes to Sleep ==References== ==External links== * Category:1985 births Category:Living people Category:21st-century male writers ","title":"Richard Fairgray"},{"id":"56582593","text":"La√´nnec Hurbon (sometimes anglicised as Laennec Hurbon; born 1940) is a Haitian sociologist and writer specialised in the relationships between religion, culture and politics in the Caribbean region. He is an ex-priest turned researcher and writer. == Career == Hurbon was born in Jacmel, a commune in southern Haiti. He is Doctor of Theology (Institut Catholique de Paris) and Sociology (Sorbonne University), director of research at CNRS and professor at the Quisqueya University in Port-au-Prince, of which he is one of the founding members. Today he focuses on the relationships between religion, culture and politics in the Caribbean region and has written many books on Haitian Vodou. His notable publications are the (1972) and (1987), which have been described as \\"two classics\\" of the author; and the \\"small 'big book'\\" ‚Äì (1993, US ed. ‚Äì Voodoo: Search for the Spirit), which is a heavily illustrated pocket book from √âditions Gallimard's \\"D√©couvertes\\" collection. He also edited a collective work entitled (2014). == == Rooted in the history of Haiti, La√´nnec Hurbon presents us Vodou in this small but copiously illustrated book, entitled (lit. 'The Mysteries of Vodou'; US edition ‚Äì Voodoo: Search for the Spirit; UK edition ‚Äì Voodoo: Truth and Fantasy), which Christiane Veauvy‚Äîa researcher at CNRS‚Äîcalls it \\"a great achievement\\", and \\"the iconography is of exceptional beauty\\", in her article dedicated to this book. After so many persecutions‚Äîthose of the slave society, the Catholic Church, the racism, the horror sensations because of devils and zombies, also of Haitian authorities after the independence, even though Vodou has supported the freedom to slaves‚Äîafter the drastic political exploitation by Fran√ßois Duvalier, Vodou remains \\"one of the most inalienable cultural resources of Haitian people\\". The book also suggests the complex role played by Vodou in the fall of Duvalier's dictatorship. The plan of the work is dictated by this historico- political perspective, there are seven chapters: I, \\"The Great Crossing\\"; II, \\"Voodoo Hidden in the Hell of Slavery\\"; III, \\"Campaigns Against Sorcery\\"; IV, \\"The Spirit of the 'Lwa'\\"; V, \\"The Cult of the Dead\\"; VI, \\"'Manj√©-Lwa', 'Dans√©-Lwa': The Services\\"; VII, \\"An Astonishing Survival\\". The first three chapters trace the history of Vodou in Haiti from \\"the great crossing\\" to the time of the American occupation (1915‚Äì1934) and the advent of Duvalier (chap. III), going through the period when \\"Vodou hidden in the hell of slavery\\" (chap. II). It is only then that Hurbon systematically exposes the beliefs and practices of Vodou as a system articulating a mythology, rituals and standards of behaviour (chaps. IV‚ÄìVI). The last chapter is devoted to the \\"astonishing survival\\" of Vodou. Hurbon addresses the issue of the establishment of Protestant sects that \\"by passing off all the lwa as evil or satanic forces, the message of the Protestant sects revives the fantasy of sorcery\\", and also questions whether \\"Voodoo has a tendency to draw its worshippers towards the past, placing them under the authority of tradition (symbolized by the dead, the ancestors, the lwa) rather than more flexible rules, subject to modern rational thinking?\\" Whatever the case may be, Vodou is \\"a piece of worldwide cultural patrimony\\", and a civilisation \\"extending from Africa to the Americas\\". The following \\"Documents\\" section containing a compilation of excerpts which is divided into six parts: 1, The devil, voodoo and the missionaries; 2, The antisuperstitious campaigns; 3, How the lwa show themselves to humans; 4, For the rehabilitation of voodoo; 5, Voodoo in art; 6, People travel, so do spirits. These are followed by a glossary, chronology, further reading, list of illustrations and index. With this work, the reader can have a complete and excellent point about Vodou in its many dimensions. The book is profusely illustrated with colour plates‚Äîdrawings, photographs, Haitian paintings, etc.‚Äîso it could also serve indirectly as a study of Haitian Vodou iconography. It has been translated into American and British English, Russian, South Korean and Spanish. Professor Patrick Bellegarde-Smith notes that the original French edition printed many of the black and white photographs in the \\"Documents\\" section on better paper than the English edition; and also the mistranslation of the term by using Voodoo instead of Vodou. == Publications == === Publications by Hurbon=== * Dieu dans le Vaudou ha√Øtien. √âditions Payot, 1972 * Culture et dictature en Ha√Øti : l'imaginaire sous contr√¥le.

It was used on the Italian three-phase test line from Rome-Sulmona especially in express train service. After the end of the trial operation in 1945, the locomotives were scrapped, and no locomotive of the class has been preserved. ==Background== The operating experience with the northern Italian three-phase network running at 3.6 kV, 16.7 Hz threw up several problems. With increasing power demands, the voltage was too low and the direct drive to the axles risked overloading the traction motors. Therefore, it was decided to try a trial route, which would be electrified with a 10 kV, 45 Hz three-phase power system. This had the advantage that power plants could be used with industrial frequency. It would be a test track with steep gradients and small radius curves. The Rome - Sulmona route was selected for the test. The Class E.470 differed from earlier three-phase locomotives in two respects. The traction motors were supplied through a transformer and they drove through reduction gears to two dummy shafts, which were coupled to the driving wheels with the usual side rod drive. For the experiment, the following locomotives were provided: * Four express locomotives FS Class E.470 as described here * Seventeen passenger locomotives FS Class E.472 * Four freight locomotives FS Class E.570 In addition, there was a locomotive, FS Class E.471, with a rotary converter. ==History of the locomotives== The Class E.470 locomotives were built by Tecnomasio Italiano Brown Boveri (TIBB) at Vado Ligure and bore a strong resemblance to FS Class E.431, including the use of pole pantographs. However, they could be distinguished from the E.431 by the presence of the oil cooler for the transformer and the dummy shafts on the drive triangle. After construction, the locomotives were tested on a section of the Modane - Turin railway line. The locomotives were assigned from 1925 to 1928 the depot at Bussoleno. After 1928 they were transferred to the depot at Rome (San Lorenzo) to operate on the line from Rome to Sulmona. After 1935, they were relocated to the depot at Sulmona. Overall, the operation with 10 kV, 45 Hz, three-phase did not bring particularly positive results. Fewer substations were required but there were more difficulties in the operation of the double overhead contact line, so that maintenance costs were high. For the latter reason, the line was rebuilt in 1945, after heavy damage in World War II, with 3 kV direct current (DC). E.470.001 was scrapped in July 1947 at Turin. In December 1947, E.470.002 was scrapped and the other two machines disappeared in the same year. Among the negative results of the test operation was the out-dated equipment of locomotives with rod drive. The electric locomotives with DC drive had a better control and fewer operational difficulties. For this reason, the experimental three-phase operation on the Rome - Sulmona line was not seen as a success. ==Construction== ===Mechanical=== The Class E.470 had a 1 πD1 π wheel arrangement. The outermost of the four driven axles were connected to Zara bogies. The drive and mechanical equipment was derived from the FS E.431. As there were sometimes difficulties in this class with overloading of the drive motors, those of the E.470 were put higher and worked via a gear transmission on a jackshaft. This resulted in a more flexible connection and fewer starting difficulties of the engines. From the jackshaft, the force was transmitted to the axles via a triangle and coupling rods, as with the FS E.431. Originally, the four locomotives were equipped with rod pantographs. These were later replaced with pantographs analogous to those of Class FS E.432, probably to suit the higher voltage. In this case, a tubular construction was erected on two stems to support the current collector, a construction designed to achieve greater distance for bridging dead parts of the overhead lines. ===Electrical=== Like Class FS E.431, the E.470 also had four-speed electrical equipment. The current, taken from the overhead line and stepped down by the transformer with the optimum power factor, was transferred to the traction motors for propulsion. The four fixed speeds were obtained by switching between 6 or 8 poles on the motors and by parallel or cascade connection. Intermediate speeds were achieved by using a liquid rheostat, which allowed uniform acceleration when starting and when changing connections. The mode of action was analogous to the three-phase locomotives for 3.6 kV, 16.7 Hz. The main transformer was oil cooled. It supplied 1,000 V to the traction motors and had an additional winding at 110 V for auxiliaries. ==References== Category:1‚Ä≤D1‚Ä≤ locomotives E.470 Category:Three-phase AC locomotives Category:Standard gauge locomotives of Italy ","title":"FS Class E.470"},{"id":"56582755","text":"The Victualling Inshore Craft, or VIC, was a type of auxiliary vessel built for the Royal Navy during the Second World War. The VIC was modelled on the Clyde puffer, and over 100 were built during the conflict. ==Background== During the First World War the Royal Navy had need of an auxiliary vessel suitable for lightering supplies to its ships in a variety of settings, often with insufficient, or completely without, shore facilities. Numerous civilian vessels were requisitioned, but the type found most suitable was the Clyde puffer. This was a small, coal-fired, steam ship, with a comparatively large hold and equipped with a derrick for unloading. The puffers were employed ferrying all manner of supplies around the Firth of Clyde and Scotland's west coast, where small communities had limited, or no, harbour facilities.History at Clyde Maritime; retrieved 14 February 2018 ==Design== With the outbreak of the Second World War, and the decline in numbers of the puffers during the 1930s, led the Admiralty to order the Victualling Inshore Craft, to a design based on two recent puffers, the Hay boats Anzac and Lascar. These were both coal-fired and steam-powered, limiting the pressure on supplies of fuel oil and diesel, though later VICs were diesel-powered. The puffers were typically divided into \\"shorehead\\" (or coastal) boats, with a maximum length of 66 ft, and \\"outside\\" (sea-going) boats, of 80 ft. The shorehead boats were within the dimensions of the Forth & Clyde Canal sealocks, making it possible for them to enter the inland waterway system, though the outside boats were more suited to the Atlantic conditions off the west coast. ==Construction== Some 107 VICs were ordered by the Admiralty; of these four were later cancelled, and four others were unfinished at the war's end, being completed for merchant service. Of the 99 in RN service, 63 were of the coastal (66 ft) type, and 36 (mostly later) of the sea-going (80 ft) type. The majority, 88, were steam-powered, while 11 (9 coastal, and 2 sea-going) had diesel engines.List of VICs (compiled by Allan T. Condie) at VIC56.co.uk; retrieved 14 February 2018 While the puffer was a Scottish design, the Clyde shipyards were fully occupied with building and repairing ships for the Merchant and the Royal Navys, so the VICs were built at river and canal yards in England. The main yards involved were Dunston, of Thorne, South Yorkshire (40 in total built) and Pimblotts of Northwich (28). Other yards employed were S&D; Brown, of Hull; Watson, of Gainsborough; Pollock, of Faversham; Richards, of Lowestoft; Harker, of Knottingley; Goole Shipbuilding and Rowhedge Ironworks.List of Builders at Clyde Maritime; retrieved 14 February 2018 ==Service history== The VICs were employed at RN harbours and anchorages around the coast of Britain, lightering all manner of supplies as needed. Their largely unsung work was nonetheless vital to the smooth running of naval operations. With the war's end the VICs were sold into merchant service, many being employed on the Clyde into the late 1940s and 50's. ==Notes== ==References== *Burrows, George W. (1981). Puffer Ahoy!.

They constituted the first Italian experiment in using a phase converter. The final goal was to power them with single-phase alternating current, constituting the first case of a European locomotive of this type designed according to modern criteria. However, the difficulty of the development, and political interference, led to the abandonment of the project. ==History== In 1928, following the experience acquired in the three-phase high-voltage (10 kV) AC operation with FS Class E.470, a new locomotive of was built, which was supposed to represent the ultimate development of three-phase traction. It was called E.471, and it had the same 1‚Ä≤D1‚Ä≤ wheel arrangement as E.470, but it was technically different. Designed by the famous engineer K√°lm√°n Kand√≥ and built in the plant of Construzioni Elettro Meccaniche di Saronno (CEMSA), it was aimed at the future development of three-phase traction. According to the research of the engineer the project was not developed by the FS but autonomously by CEMSA thanks to the collaboration it had established with Kand√≥. According to some oral testimonies, after management changes at the Material and Traction Service of FS due to the advent of Fascism in Italy, the project was judged \\"an error of the engineer Donati\\" and the test results were held to be unsatisfactory. Ten locomotives had been ordered but the project was terminated early and only one was actually built. On the other hand, Mascherpa provided an impressive documentation from which it seems that, at the end of the test runs, a tractive effort corresponding to that envisaged was achieved. Rather, the real reason for the termination was the hostility of the new FS leadership to the engineer Alfredo Donati (former director of the Special Electrification Unit of the General Directorate of FS) who was deported following the appointment of the extraordinary commissioner . The success of direct current experiments, favoured by the new railway management, meant that the E.471 remained at the prototype stage and never entered regular service. ==Technical details== These were rotary converter locomotives and the long-term aim was to run them from a single-phase supply. For the tests, they were run from a three-phase supply at either 3.6 kV, 16.7 Hz or 10 kV 45 Hz. Current collection was made by a pair of twin-collector bow collectors. Mechanical drive from the two frame-mounted traction motors to the wheels was by means of a Kand√≥ triangle drive and coupling rods. ==References== ==Further reading== * Pietro Verole, La grande trazione elettrica, Milano, Hoepli, 1926 * Giuseppe Bianchi, Dati relativi alla costruzione e all'esercizio delle locomotive elettriche trifasi e a corrente continua, in Rendiconti della XXXIII Riunione annuale dell'AEI, 1928 * Attilio Giaquinto, Un nuovo tipo di locomotiva per la trazione elettrica monopolifase, in Rendiconti della XXXIII Riunione annuale dell'AEI, 1928, memoria n. 46, pp. 426‚Äì437 * Uberto Bajocchi, Il sistema Kand√≥.

At his employer's urging and with ¬£250 of his money to invest as well as ¬£40 of his own,Unpublished manuscript by Donald Langmead. Copy held in the Architecture Museum, University of South Australia, Langmead collection. he emigrated to South Australia aboard Recovery, arriving in September 1839. He found work with an Adelaide ironmonger, but soon went into business on his own account and was quite successful. Around 1845, after the discovery of copper at Burra Burra, he invested all his savings in South Australian Mining Association (\\"Snobs\\")Investors in the South Australian Mining Association were mostly affluent tradesmen and businessmen, not big investors \\"Nobs\\" from Adelaide's wealthy elite who had the nearby, and comparatively worthless, \\"Princess Royal\\" mine. Originally, \\"snob\\" was a somewhat derogatory term for tradesman; discounting such persons for their calling was termed \\"snobbery\\". shares, which repaid him handsomely: soon he was S.A.M.A.'s largest shareholder, with ¬£1,090 in ¬£5 shares, roughly 9% of the original total shareholding of ¬£12,320, having presumably purchased additional scrip from early profit takers. Directors (all major shareholders) were Charles Beck, James Bunce, John Benjamin Graham, John Bentham Neales, William Paxton, William Peacock, Charles Septimus Penny, Emanuel Solomon, and Samuel Stocks, jun., with (later Sir) Henry Ayers as secretary. In two years he was in receipt of ¬£16,000 in dividends per annum, tens of millions of dollars in today's currency. ;Prospect House Prospect House \\"Graham's Castle\\" c. 1860 In 1846 Graham purchased a property, on the Lower North Road (now Prospect Road) in the suburb of Prospect, previously owned by John and Maria Richmond. :John Richmond (died 23 June 1862), with his wife Maria nƒóe Urquhart (died 1 April 1845) arrived in South Australia aboard Ariadne August 1839, with their family: Mary Ann Richmond (1828‚Äì1920) later Gregorson then Duncan; Agnes Muir Richmond (1831‚Äì1924); John Richmond (c. 1836-1886); and Maria Richmond ( ‚Äì1858) later Thomson. :They built a stone cottage on their large property, Section 372 on the Lower North Road (now Prospect Road), Prospect, then moved to a property which they dubbed \\"Glen Urquhart\\" of some at the Torrens Gorge. He erected a 3-metre-high stone fence, and engaged architect Thomas Price to build for him an opulent mansion of 30 rooms, dwarfing every other pile in the city, including Government House. :Thomas Price was an architect and surveyor from Wales, who briefly had a practice in Melbourne, then from 1846 to 1852 in Adelaide. He may not have been notable as an architect, but was certainly prolific. He laid out some 17 townships, most now being residential suburbs east of Adelaide, and designed numerous shops and houses, several hotels, a grandstand for the \\"Old Racecourse\\" (now Victoria Park), and a 50-cottage housing estate between Waymouth and Franklin streets. His two most significant buildings were the New Queen's Theatre for George Coppin and Prospect House for John Benjamin Graham. Tenders were called on 22 August 1846 to build a high limestone wall around four acres of the property and three weeks later tenders were invited from various trades to build the mansion, followed by tenders for coachhouse, and stables. Note the other irons Price had in the fire. It is likely, but not certain, that the Richmonds' cottage was retained, perhaps as servants' quarters. Prospect House was Adelaide's first Gothic Revival mansion, and designed to be impressive. It was box-like of two storeys, the upper floor being of a smaller plan than the ground floor. It reputedly had thirty rooms, and was built of coursed local limestone. It had a wide west-facing veranda with a return to its north side. Rooms on the upper floor opened via French windows with green-painted cedar shutters onto a crenellated open balcony. The veranda was also enclosed by shutters. The flat roof, which was accessible from below and surrounded by a crenellated parapet, gave a panoramic view of the Adelaide plains from the sea to the Adelaide Hills and beyond. Even the chimneys were crenellated, reinforcing the popular epithet \\"castle\\". The interior was spacious and impressive, with polished oak and cedar panelling and marble inlays. The thirty rooms included a wide hall and a dining room with eight doors running on little wheels which fitted into recesses in the wall, and a panelled partition which folded back to make two large rooms into an immense one. The building, which dwarfed every other mansion in the colony, including Government House, loudly proclaimed its owner's wealth, though not necessarily exemplifying good taste. A. T. Saunders warns against confusing Prospect House with John Howard Angas's Prospect Lodge, on the Torrens Road corner, Bowden, opposite the Park Lands. ===Return to England=== Around 1847 he brought his mother and stepfather, John Adams, out to South Australia, and had them living with him at Prospect House, The author had never seen Graham's Castle, or he would have known it was not on Torrens Road presumably as caretakers against the event of Graham's return to Adelaide; this notion is supported by an entry in his diary. In January 1848 he left Adelaide aboard Gellert for Calcutta, and toured the East and Europe before settling in England. From 1848 to 1867 Henry Ayers served as his agent in South Australia, followed by his brothers- in-law Frank and Henry Rymill. He returned briefly to Adelaide aboard European in March 1858, when he resigned as a director of the Burra Burra Association. Investments in South Australia included the Canowie and Curnamona Stations in 1869, which were sold in 1926. He purchased a Schloss in Handschuhsheim, near Heidelberg, where he resided from around 1855, and was known for his gracious and lavish hospitality. He died at his residence, Warrior Square, St Leonards- on-Sea on 8 November 1876, with an estate estimated at ¬£200,000. ==Family== Graham married Louisa Rymill, eldest daughter of Robert Rymill, of Brompton Row, near London, on 10 April 1849. Louisa was a sister of Henry and Frank Rymill; it was at her urging that they arrived in Adelaide aboard Caucasian in October 1855. *Harry Robert Graham (1850 ‚Äì 11 January 1933), eldest son was a successful scholar at Oxford A caricature by Sir Leslie Ward (\\"Spy\\") was published in Vanity Fair on 11 May 1893. He was elected a Member of Parliament for St. Pancras West. He never married. *Louisa Maude Graham (1851‚Äì1924) married Edward Samuel Hamersley (1839 ‚Äì 11 January 1909) of Pyrton Manor, Watlington in 1878. He was a nephew of Edward Hamersley (senior) (1810‚Äì1874). She was his second wife. *Frederick Malcolm \\"Fred\\" Graham (1856 ‚Äì 8 May 1911) married Annabella Stewart \\"Anna\\" Butterworth (c. ‚Äì 28 September 1894) on 16 February 1887. They purchased her father John Butterworth's property, Bungala House (which still stands) near Yankalilla. He married again, in 1896, to Marion Elizabeth Mayfield ( ‚Äì 2 February 1951) on 18 February 1896. Their two sons and four daughters included: :*John Benjamin Graham MC AFC (1888 ‚Äì ) was an airman, decorated during WWI, retired 1939. :*Marion Louisa Graham (1897‚Äì ) :*Harry Robert Graham (1900 ‚Äì ) :*Lilian Florence Graham (1905‚Äì ) ==Later history of \\"Graham's Castle\\"== Graham's stepfather John Adams remained at Prospect House, hosting a Christmas party for Sunday School children at Prospect House, and a fete in honor of the consecration of Christ Church, which was recorded on watercolors by S. T. Gill. A similar occasion the following year was marred by a self-selected elite who blocked the Sunday School teachers from the dining room until all the drinks and party food was gone. Adams announced his imminent return to England in June 1853. He organised a sale of Graham's movable assets including his pipe organ, which was purchased for Christ Church, North Adelaide, and later went to the Norwood Baptist Church. *W. H. Clark purchased the property for ¬£4,300 in 1853. *Dr. James Bathe (c. 1815‚Äì1885), a noted horse breeder, sold the property in 1870, returned to Victoria. His son William Nicholas M. de Bathe (c. 1846 ‚Äì 4 December 1868) was a member of B. T. Finniss's 1864 expedition to Escape Cliffs, Northern Territory. *John Whinham's North Adelaide Grammar School students boarded there, and his wife Mary Whinham died there in 1891. \\"Graham's Castle\\" had the reputation of being haunted by a sailor, supposedly an earlier owner of the property. It turned out rabbits were living under the floorboards, giving rise to occasional unexplained noises. By the 20th century suburbia had encroached and the \\"Castle\\" was just an unmarketable curiosity off Braund Road, Prospect, and in the way of progress, and was demolished in September 2001. No plan of \\"Prospect House\\" survives and apart from a few street names, no evidence of its existence remains. ==See also== John Benjamin Graham on the German Wikipedia. == References == Category:1814 births Category:1876 deaths Category:Australian mining entrepreneurs Category:History of Adelaide ","title":"John Benjamin Graham"},{"id":"56582993","text":"Alessandro Mariotti (born 5 November 1998 in San Marino) is a San Marinese Alpine Skier.

The plot follows an upper-class French couple, Georges (Auteuil) and Anne (Binoche), who are terrorised by anonymous tapes that appear on their front porch and seem to show the family is under surveillance. Shot in Paris and Vienna in 2004, the film is a co-production of France, Austria, Germany and Italy. The French government's decades-long denial of the 1961 Seine River massacre was an inspiration to the story. Cach√© competed for the Palme d'Or at the 2005 Cannes Film Festival, where polled critics and festival audiences considered it a frontrunner. Ultimately, the jury awarded Haneke Best Director. At the European Film Awards, it competed with the Cannes Palme d'Or winner, L'Enfant by the Dardenne brothers, with Cach√© winning five awards, including Best Film. The film was submitted as Austria's entry for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film at the 78th Academy Awards, but was disqualified as French is not predominantly the language of Austria. As Haneke is Austrian, it would have also been disqualified if France or any other country had submitted it. The exclusion sparked criticism, with Sony Pictures Classics co-president Michael Barker calling it \\"unfortunate\\" and saying the story demanded the film be in French. Austria's Fachverband der Audiovisions und Filmindustrie protested the criteria, and Haneke, whose previous French-language The Piano Teacher was not disqualified as the Austrian submission, also called the rules \\"really stupid\\". Academy member Mark Johnson responded, \\"We're in the process right now of considering some very radical changes\\". ==Accolades== { class=\\" plainrowheaders sortable\\" - ! scope=\\"col\\" Award ! scope=\\"col\\" Date of ceremony ! scope=\\"col\\" Category ! scope=\\"col\\" Recipient(s) ! scope=\\"col\\" Result ! scope=\\"col\\" class=\\"unsortable\\" - !scope=\\"row\\"  Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences of Argentina  December 2006  Best Foreign Film  rowspan=\\"8\\"  Michael Haneke   - !scope=\\"row\\"  Bodil Awards  25 February 2007  Best Non-American Film   - !scope=\\"row\\"  British Independent Film Awards  29 November 2006  Best Foreign Independent Film   - !scope=\\"row\\" rowspan=3 Cannes Film Festival  rowspan=\\"3\\"  11 ‚Äì 22 May 2005  Best Director   rowspan=\\"3\\"  -  FIPRESCI Prize  -  Prize of the Ecumenical Jury  - !scope=\\"row\\" rowspan=4 C√©sar Awards  rowspan=\\"4\\" 25 February 2006  Best Director   rowspan=\\"4\\"  -  Best Original Screenplay  -  Best Supporting Actor  Maurice B√©nichou  -  Most Promising Actor  Walid Afkir  - !scope=\\"row\\"  Chicago Film Critics Association  9 January 2006  Best Foreign Language Film  rowspan=\\"9\\" Michael Haneke   - !scope=\\"row\\"  Critics' Choice Awards  9 January 2006  Best Foreign Language Film   - !scope=\\"row\\"  David di Donatello  2006  Best European Film   - !scope=\\"row\\" rowspan=2 Diagonale  rowspan=\\"2\\"  March 2005  Best Director   rowspan=\\"2\\"  -  FIPRESCI Prize  - !scope=\\"row\\"  Empire Awards  27 March 2007  Best Thriller   - !scope=\\"row\\" rowspan=8 European Film Awards  rowspan=\\"8\\" 3 December 2005  Best Film   rowspan=\\"8\\" -  Best Director  -  Best Screenwriter  -  Best Actor  Daniel Auteuil  -  Best Actress  Juliette Binoche  -  Best Editor  Michael Hudecek and Nadine Muse  -  Best Cinematographer  Christian Berger  -  FIPRESCI Prize  rowspan=\\"4\\" Michael Haneke  - !scope=\\"row\\"  Film Critics Circle of Australia  2006  Best Foreign Language Film   - !scope=\\"row\\"  Gopo Awards  2007  Best European Film   - !scope=\\"row\\"  Guldbagge Awards  30 January 2006  Best Foreign Film   - !scope=\\"row\\" rowspan=2 London Film Critics Circle  rowspan=\\"2\\"  8 February 2006  Actress of the Year  Juliette Binoche   rowspan=\\"2\\"  -  Foreign Language Film of the Year  rowspan=\\"3\\" Michael Haneke  - !scope=\\"row\\"  Los Angeles Film Critics Association  10 December 2005  Best Foreign Language Film   - !scope=\\"row\\"  Lumi√®res Awards  rowspan=\\"1\\"  21 February 2006  Best Screenplay   rowspan=\\"1\\"  - !scope=\\"row\\" rowspan=2 Nastro d'Argento  rowspan=\\"2\\"  2006  Best Female Dubbing  Alessandra Korompay   rowspan=\\"2\\"  -  Best Foreign Director  rowspan=\\"9\\" Michael Haneke  - !scope=\\"row\\"  National Society of Film Critics  8 January 2006  Best Foreign Language Film   - !scope=\\"row\\"  New York Film Critics Circle  8 January 2006  Best Foreign Language Film   - !scope=\\"row\\"  Online Film Critics Society  16 January 2006  Best Foreign Language Film   - !scope=\\"row\\"  San Francisco Film Critics Circle  12 December 2005  Best Foreign Language Film   - !scope=\\"row\\"  Valladolid International Film Festival  October 2006  50th Anniversary Prize   - !scope=\\"row\\" rowspan=3 Village Voice Film Poll  rowspan=\\"3\\" 2006  Best Film   -  Best Director   -  Best Screenplay   - } ==References== == External links == * Category:Lists of accolades by film ","title":"List of accolades received by Cach√©"},{"id":"56583336","text":"Lords of Chaos is a 2018 horror-thriller film directed by Jonas √Ökerlund and written by Dennis Magnusson and √Ökerlund. Adapted from the 1998 book of the same name, the film is a historical fiction account of the early 1990s Norwegian black metal scene told from the perspective of Mayhem co-founder Euronymous. It stars Rory Culkin as Euronymous, Emory Cohen as Varg Vikernes, Jack Kilmer as Dead, and Sky Ferreira as Ann-Marit. The film premiered at the 2018 Sundance Film Festival, was released in the United States on 8 February 2019 by Gunpowder & Sky, and was released in the United Kingdom on 29 March 2019 by Arrow Films. It received positive reviews from critics, but got a polarizing reception from audiences within the metal community. ==Plot== In 1987, a young guitarist called Euronymous forms a black metal band called Mayhem, the first of the genre in their country of Norway, with Necrobutcher on bass, and Manheim on drums. Manheim leaves and is soon replaced by new drummer Hellhammer and they recruit a new vocalist from Sweden called Dead, who exhibits self-destructive behavior, during their live shows cutting himself and bleeding on the audience and throwing pig heads at the \\"posers\\". At a show filmed by their friend Metalion, the band meets a fan named Kristian, whom Euronymous initially looks down on. While home alone, Dead uses his personal knife to cut his arms and throat, and then uses Euronymous' shotgun to shoot himself in the forehead, leaving behind a suicide note. Euronymous returns home and finds the body but instead of calling the police, he takes photos of the body and moves the knife and shotgun around. After Dead's body is taken to the morgue, Euronymous gives necklaces to the other band members which he claims are pieces of Dead's skull; this disgusts Necrobutcher, prompting him to leave the band. Soon after, Euronymous starts his own black metal record label and opens a record shop called Helvete (\\"Hell\\"), which becomes a social hub for black-metallers like Metalion, Fenriz of Darkthrone, Faust of Emperor, and Kristian (who is now calling himself Varg Vikernes) of Burzum. They become known as the \\"Black Circle\\". After being mocked by Euronymous, Varg who is very anti-Christian burns down a local church. When challenged by Varg concerning his status as the leader of the Black Circle, Euronymous burns down a church with Faust and Varg accompanying. Euronymous recruits Varg as bassist, a guitarist called Blackthorn and a Hungarian vocalist, Attila Csihar, to record Mayhem's first album, De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas. A power dispute between Varg and Euronymous arises. After a wave of church burnings begins, Faust brutally kills a gay man, leading police to link black-metallers to the crimes. Helvete is raided and shut down by the police, and Varg is arrested as prime suspect after an interview with a Bergen newspaper in which he boasts of the crimes. He is soon released for lack of evidence. Varg tells Euronymous that he is leaving Mayhem and is starting his own record label. Euronymous reveals that the \\"skull piece\\" necklaces were fakes, and that he never intended anyone to follow through on his angry rhetoric, which infuriates Varg. In anger, Euronymous rants to a peer about wanting to kill Varg, but later calms down and sends him a contract to release their music rights to him. Varg, having heard that Euronymous was making death threats against him, travels to Oslo in the early morning of August 10 to confront him. Telling Euronymous he wants to sign the contract, he enters his apartment and, after a brief conversation, stabs him. Euronymous pleads for his life, but Varg follows him through the apartment to the stairwell outside and stabs him to death. The next day, the news of Euronymous' murder spreads throughout Norway and Varg is soon arrested. He is sent to prison for a maximum of 21 years, guilty of both the murder of Euronymous and the burning of several churches. In a voice-over, Euronymous tells the audience not to feel sorry for him, that he enjoyed his life and invented a new sub-genre of metal. ==Cast== ==Production== Lords of Chaos is based on the 1998 book of the same name. Originally, Japanese director Sion Sono was set to direct a film based on the book, with Jackson Rathbone starring as Varg Vikernes. It would have been Sono's first English-language film. The screenplay was written by Hans Fjellestad (who was earlier reported to be the film's director as well), Ryan Page, Adam Parfrey (the book's publisher), and Sono.Official site In July 2009, Sono stated that filming (in Norway) would begin in August or September and end in December. The film was set to be released in 2010. It was later announced that Rathbone would no longer be playing Vikernes due to scheduling conflicts. In May 2015, it was announced that former Bathory drummer and film director Jonas √Ökerlund would direct the film. The film was set to shoot in the fall of 2015 in Norway, but for unknown reasons, filming did not begin until 2016. The film was shot in Oslo, Norway, with live performance scenes shot in Budapest, Hungary. The live sequences shoot also included filming for the Metallica music video \\"ManUNkind\\", starring the cast of the film. Vikernes, who had already expressed criticisms against the book, stated in a video uploaded to his YouTube channel in 2016 that when approached by the filmmakers, he, along with Mayhem and Darkthrone, denied the rights for their music to be used in the film. In a 2018 interview, √Ökerlund said that they had in fact secured the rights to Mayhem's music. ==Historical accuracy== √Ökerlund described the film as \\"about truth and lies\\". In an interview for Dazed Digital, it was reported that √Ökerlund consulted \\"original band merch ... was granted access to key police reports as well as detailed photos of Euronymous‚Äôs record store Helvete, and the house the band camped out in. ... √Ökerlund even used real locations for exterior shots of, among others, Euronymous‚Äôs flat and a rebuilt church that Vikernes burnt down in Holmenkollen.\\" Culkin said that he prepared for his role by consulting several associates of Euronymous: \\"They almost always compared him to a mythological creature: one person said he was kind of like a gnome and another said he was like an evil elf. Because he was small a dude but confident in himself and he has this clan around him, people really embellished and lionised him.\\" In one scene from the film, Dead anachronistically declares, \\"We are Lords of Chaos.\\" The name actually originates from the unrelated American criminal group whose name was adopted for the book Lords of Chaos. The book's scope was not focused solely on the Norwegian black metal scene. Jack Kilmer's performance as the band's frontman Dead has received praise for being the most accurate portrayal in the film, with the exception of one scene where he has a cat hanging from his room. The real Dead never killed any cats but did chase them off for fun. Some criticisms were made that the Live in Jessheim scene jumps to Dead's suicide, given a whole year had passed in between both events and Dead and Euronymous' subsequent falling out and animosity was never portrayed apart from one scene in which Euronymous mockingly waves a shotgun in front of Dead and suggests he shoots himself. The time Dead stabbed Euronymous was never portrayed in the film. ==Release and reception== The first screening on Lords of Chaos was held during 2018 Sundance Film Festival on 23 January 2018 in Park City, Utah. In October 2018, a first-quarter 2019 release window for the US was announced, with Arrow Films securing the rights for distribution in the UK. It was released in the US on 8 February 2019 by Gunpowder & Sky. In the UK, it was released on 29 March 2019. ===Reactions from the depicted=== Attila Csihar, in a January 2019 interview, stated that the official opinion of the current Mayhem members regarding the film and its creators is a \\"big fuck you\\". He pointed out that the film was based on a book and only focused on Mayhem during the 1990s, not the whole black metal scene at the time. He confirmed that some Tormentor songs appear in the film and that he himself is played by his son, Arion Csihar. Attila himself was present during the shooting of the church burning scenes. In a later interview in May 2019, he offered a more nuanced critique of the film, saying that while the film is based on reality, he disagrees with how the story was presented, and that the characters were portrayed as \\"idiots\\".https://24.hu/kultura/2019/05/15/csihar-attila-nem- orulunk-hogy-a-mi-nevunkhoz-fuzodnek-a-templomegetesek/ Vikernes harshly criticised the film as \\"made-up crap\\", objecting to being portrayed by a Jewish actor and to plot elements, calling the depiction \\"character murder\\". Necrobutcher has provided ambivalent reactions after viewing the film: he praised the production values and the wardrobe accuracy, but noted that the movie was \\"sad\\" and \\"not a good movie\\", and that viewing the murder scenes had an emotional effect on him. He also addressed Mayhem's initial negative reaction to the announcement of the film, and explained that their intense negative reaction was largely because the band has only been approached after production on the film has started, and that he gave permission to use Mayhem's music in the film after seeing a rough cut. Ultimately he noted that the film had very little impact on the band. ===Critical reception=== On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, Lords of Chaos holds an approval rating of 74% based on 68 reviews, and an average rating of 6.6/10. It states that the general consensus among critics was that \\"Lords of Chaos presents a grimly compelling dramatization of a real-life music scene whose aggressively nihilistic aesthetic spilled over into fatal acts of violence.\\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 47 out of 100, based on 15 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". In his review for The Hollywood Reporter Justin Lowe praised Lords of Chaos as a \\"vibrant biopic\\" that \\"provokes both awe and repulsion\\". Amy Nicholson of Variety wrote that \\"Despite √Ökerlund‚Äôs refusal to lionize these immature kids, Lords of Chaos is tremendous fun. ... he can also get great performances out of a young cast\\". Indiewires Michael Nordine awarded the film a B rating and wrote \\"Lords of Chaos is frequently unpleasant but oddly compelling ‚Äî not least because √Ökerlund ensures that the film never takes itself as seriously as its subjects did.\\" Conversely, The A.V. Clubs Katie Rife decried that \\"√Ökerlund's understanding [of the Norwegian black metal scene] is more like contempt\\". Kory Grow of Rolling Stone wrote: \\"perhaps the film's worst sin is its tone ... It‚Äôs not fun. It‚Äôs not sad. A lot of the time, it‚Äôs not even all that interesting.\\" Robert Ham of Consequence of Sound wrote that \\"Instead of courting [the black metal] audience, or trying to find some middle ground where [√Ökerlund] celebrates the music while rightfully disparaging the actions of some of its worst figureheads, he punches down with a smirk and dismisses the birth of a genre as the product of misspent youth.\\" The New York Times Manohla Dargis criticised the film for \\"never establish[ing] a coherent or interesting point of view. The tone unproductively veers from the goofy to the creepy, which creates a sense that [√Ökerlund] was still figuring it out in the editing.\\" Robert Abele of The Los Angeles Times summarized that \\"Ultimately it all adds up to a hodgepodge of styles and attitudes with hardly any insight into what made this corrosive clique so magnetic to its adherents.\\" ==See also== *Until the Light Takes Us, 2008 documentary film about the Norwegian black metal scene *Murder of Euronymous ==References* * Category:2018 films Category:2018 horror thriller films Category:Black metal Category:British films Category:British horror thriller films Category:Films about musical groups Category:Films based on non-fiction books Category:Films directed by Jonas √Ökerlund Category:Films set in the 1980s Category:Films set in the 1990s Category:Films set in 1991 Category:Films set in 1992 Category:Films set in 1993 Category:Films set in Norway Category:Films shot in Norway Category:Heavy metal films Category:Horror films based on actual events Category:Mayhem (band) Category:Swedish films Category:Swedish horror films Category:Swedish thriller films Category:Thriller films based on actual events ","title":"Lords of Chaos (film)"},{"id":"56583346","text":"Yerkebulan Shamukhanov (born 23 August 1999) is a Kazakhstani short track speed skater.

Dishon was the first woman listed in the Chicago Tribune masthead and, at one time, the most influential female journalist at the newspaper. == Personal == Colleen \\"Koky\\" Dishon was born prematurely in a rural cabin in Kentucky in 1924. She grew up in Zanesville, Ohio with her mother and five siblings. On a hot summer day in 1941, her mother told her to do something so she wouldn't notice the heat. That is when she got her first job at her town's newspaper. Dishon met her husband, Bob Dishon, while they worked for the Columbus Dispatch. They both eventually quit their jobs there and began working at the Daily News in Chicago, Illinois. Bob was a city desk reporter and Koky was in feature sections there. Colleen and Bob worked closely together and were allies in the workplace. Bob and Koky were married 54 years when Koky died in 2004. == Career == Koky Dishon got her first job at the age of 16 at the Zanesville, Ohio newspaper. \\"I cleaned myself up and walked into town,\\" she said. \\"I had no idea where I was going. When I stopped, I was at a building where the Zanesville newspapers were published. I didn't know a soul there, but I walked up the stairs and stood in the doorway and told the editor 'I want to work', and they gave me an old typewriter in the back of the room and told me to do the baby column.\\" In 1975, Dishon was hired by the Chicago Tribune to change the Tempo section into a general features section in the newspaper. While revamping the section, she changed the Tempo heading to \\"closed for remodeling.\\" That is when Dishon created Tempo Women, a column aimed at working women. \\"There was nothing in the paper that showed (women) they weren't alone in their struggle, that others were in the same boat,\\" she said. The very successful column's final version was named Womenews to appeal to working women under the age of 35. Womanews was distributed to the two million readers of the Chicago Tribune's Sunday paper. In seven years, Koky was promoted to associate editor, making her the first woman on the Chicago Tribune masthead. She maintained control of all departments outside of news and sports. Koky Dishon retired from the Chicago Tribune in 1994, at 70 years old. James D. Squires, the editor who had promoted her, said, \\"There have been two great creative people at the Chicago Tribune. The first was Col. (Robert) McCormick who put together a world-recognized newspaper, and the second was Koky Dishon who created sections people wanted to read.\\" The Tribune Managing Editor, Ann Marie Lipinski, stated, \\" Whether you have ever worked for Koky, or ever heard her name before today, if you are a newspaper reader, you are the beneficiary of her genius. She defined modern features coverage with her work in Chicago, creating the so-called 'sectional revolution' in American newspapers.\\" After her retirement, Koky contributed to the industry by becoming an editorial consultant at a weekly newspaper by Network Chicago WTTW public television. She has also helped the South Bend Tribune, in Indiana, in transitioning from an evening to morning publication. She also co-authored a book on the designing of newspapers sections. == Impact == When Koky Dishon worked for the Chicago Tribune, she influenced the newspaper so much that they called it the \\"sectional revolution.\\" She combined real news and flare to the article, making it fun and appealing to the readers. When Dishon was hired, she thought the news columns were stylistically stodgy and out of date. She created the Tempo section into more of a general interest section, bringing in more male readers. \\"She may have been the most innovative soft news editor in my generation,\\" says former Tribune editor James Squires, \\"I don't know anyone who led more changes than Koky Dishon. She was a fireball of a person who went forward every day with happiness and drive. I never saw her not smiling and having a good time.\\" There are scholarships in Dishon's name for journalism students across America. The Ohio University foundation received a $850,000 donation from the estate of Koky and Bob Dishon. \\"The generous endowment will allow us to award highly competitive scholarships to a number of journalism students,\\" the Dean of Scripps College of Communication, Gregory J. Shepherd said, \\"I am very grateful to Bob and Koky Dishon for establishing this living legacy.\\" From this scholarship, an incoming freshman pursuing a journalism major will be given $8,000. ==Awards== Distinguished Service in Journalism (1979) - Dishon received this award from Ohio State University for 17 sections she created at the Chicago Tribune that revolutionized how newspaper sections were produced. Journalism Hall of Fame (1997) Lifetime Achievement Award (2001) - Awarded to Dishon for her career \\"spent in joyful defiance of boxes and the range of restrictions that so long defined women's work in journalism.\\" Milwaukee Press Club Hall of Fame (2002) - Dishon was inducted into the Milwaukee Press Club Hall of Fame in 2002, awarded to honor the men and women who shaped and changed journalism in the region. ==See also== *International Women's Media Foundation == References == == External links == * International Women's Media Foundation Category:1924 births Category:2004 deaths Category:American women journalists Category:Chicago Tribune people Category:Journalists from Kentucky Category:Women's page journalists ","title":"Colleen Dishon"},{"id":"56583390","text":"The Barbara Ramsden Award was administered by Fellowship of Australian Writers and awarded annually to an author and editor in recognition of the efforts of both parties to produce a quality fiction or non-fiction book.

It was discovered on 8 April 2008, by astronomers of the Spacewatch program at Kitt Peak National Observatory near Tucson, Arizona, in the United States. The presumably carbonaceous body has a rotation period of 10.7 hours. == Orbit and classification == ' is classified as a member of the dynamical Hilda group, as well as a main-belt comet that shows clear cometary activity, which has also been described as a \\"quasi Hilda comet\\". Orbital backward integration suggests that it might have been a centaur or trans-Neptunian object that ended its dynamical evolution as a quasi Hilda comet. It orbits the Sun in the outer asteroid belt at a distance of 2.9‚Äì5.1 AU once every 7 years and 11 months (2,883 days; semi-major axis of 3.96 AU). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.28 and an inclination of 16¬∞ with respect to the ecliptic. The body's observation arc begins with a precovery taken by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey in October 2001, more than 5 years prior to its official discovery observation by Spacewatch. ' has a Jupiter Tisserand's parameter (TJ) of 2.926, just below Jewitt's threshold of 3, which serves as a distinction between the main-belt asteroids (TJ larger than 3) and the Jupiter-family comets (TJ between 2 and 3). == Numbering and naming == This minor planet was numbered by the Minor Planet Center on 16 February 2016 (). As of 2018, it has not been named. == Physical characteristics == ' is an assumed C-type asteroid. === Rotation period === In August 2017, a rotational lightcurve of ' was obtained from photometric observations by American astronomer Brian Warner at the Palmer Divide Station in California. Lightcurve analysis gave a rotation period of hours with a small brightness amplitude of 0.12 magnitude (). === Diameter and albedo === The Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link assumes a standard albedo for a carbonaceous body of 0.057 and calculates a diameter of 14.64 kilometers based on an absolute magnitude of 12.9.

Previous Rey de Reyes tournaments consisted of several rounds, but for 2018, which was won by Rey Escorpi√≥n.

The 1997 version was held in February, while all subsequent Rey de Reyes shows were held in March. As part of their annual Rey de Reyes event AAA holds the eponymious Rey de Reyes tournament to determine that specific year's Rey. Most years the show hosts both the qualifying round and the final match, but on occasion the qualifying matches have been held prior to the event as part of AAA's weekly television shows. The traditional format consists of four preliminary rounds, each a Four-man elimination match with each of the four winners face off in the tournament finals, again under elimination rules. There have been years where AAA has employed a different format to determine a winner. The winner of the'Rey de Reyes tournament is given a large ornamental sword to symbolize their victory, but is normally not guaranteed any other rewards for winning the tournament, although some years becoming the Rey de Reyes has earned the winner a match for the AAA Mega Championship. From 1999 through 2009 AAA also held an annual Reina de Reinas (\\"Queen of Queens\\") tournament, but later turned that into an actual championship that could be defended at any point during the year, abandoning the annual tournament concept.

Rivera received several death threats in his home country not long before he was murdered. == Life and career == Edwin Rivera Paz lived with his half-brother, Pablo Rivera Cabrera, in the San Diego neighborhood, near Mexican Federal Highway 185 that connects Minatitl√°n and Coatzacoalcos. At the time of his murder, Rivera resided in southern Veracruz seeking political asylum out of fear for his life. Rivera and his colleague Igor Padilla worked together on the comedy program Los Verduleros at the television station Hable Como Habla (HCH). While Rivera lived in Acayucan, he worked on an independent project about the challenges Central American migrants and refugees faced in Mexico, which included organized crime group violence; Rivera was making photo and video reports about the lives of other refugees in the city. ==Death== In late January 2017, Rivera fled Honduras for Acayucan after his colleague, Padilla, was murdered in San Pedro Sula. While in Acayucan, two unidentified assailants on a motorcycle chased Rivera for several blocks, beat and then repeatedly shot him on the afternoon of July 9, 2017, at approximately 2 in the afternoon. Rivera's half-brother identified his body after the attack. At the time of Rivera's murder, he had been living in southern Veracruz for several months, seeking political asylum to the Mexican Aid Commission To Refugees (COMAR). == Context == Igor Padilla, a colleague of Rivera's, was shot in January by four men wearing police uniforms in the northern Honduras city of San Pedro Sula. The men who murdered Padilla are suspected members of Mara 18. Padilla had covered crime and also hosted the humorous television show \\"Los Verduleros\\", which Rivera was the cameraman for. Soon after Padilla's murder, Rivera fled his home country for Acayucan in fear for his life. It is not immediately clear exactly how long Rivera had been in Acayucan before his death; the town lies on a heavily used route for migrants fleeing violence who are preyed on by organized crime groups. Paz was the seventh journalist killed this year in Mexico, where more than 100 reporters have been murdered since 2000. More journalists have been murdered in Veracruz than the rest of Mexico; it is now the deadliest region for media in the Western hemisphere. The situation is almost as dangerous as Rivera's native Honduras, where 69 journalists have been killed since 2003. == Reactions == The Honduran consul in Mexico asks the state prosecutor to investigate and to not let the crime go unpunished. Ricardo S√°nchez P√©rez del Pozo, the Federal Special Prosecutor for Attention to Crimes against Freedom of Expression, expressed that his office had opened a case file for the murder to determine whether it was related to the victim's work as a journalist. Jorge Morales V√°zquez, executive secretary of the Veracruz State Commission for the Care and Protection of Journalists, said the commission was investigating Rivera's reporting as a possible motive but could not provide additional information. Raul Otoniel Morazan, Honduras' consul general in Veracruz, called in an interview for all levels of the Mexican government to get to the bottom of the killing. Julian Hernandez, a spokesman for the Honduran police, said, \\"We are seeking more information about this crime in Mexico to determine if it is related to the murder of Igor Padilla and to see if any criminal gangs from Honduras were involved.\\" The Mesoamerican Migrant Movement said the circumstances of the death were \\"worrying\\" and called on authorities to investigate the case. Director-General of the UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), Irina Bokova, said, \\"I call for a thorough investigation into this crime. Freedom of expression and freedom of information in the region will remain threatened as long as impunity is allowed to prevail for crimes against journalists and media workers.\\" ==See also== * List of journalists and media workers killed in Mexico * List of journalists killed in 2017 == References == == External links == *Edwin Rivera Paz at the Committee to Protect Journalists website Category:Honduran journalists Category:Murdered journalists Category:1989 births Category:2017 deaths ","title":"Edwin Rivera Paz"},{"id":"56584142","text":"Quetelet rings on a dusty mirror Quetelet rings are a type of optical interference pattern occurring at an illuminated reflective surface covered by fine particles, such as a dusty mirror. It is named after the astronomer Adolphe Quetelet, who observed the phenomenon and explained its formation. A slight variation of the setup is sometimes referred to as Newton's dusty mirror experiment, since Isaac Newton had already discovered the phenomenon by the end of 17th century, but did not interpret or explain it.Karl Exner: Ueber die Newtonschen Staubringe Quetelet rings arise from interference of the light that is first scattered by a particle and then reflected by the surface, with the light that first gets reflected and then scattered by the particle. Contributions of these two paths to the scattering differ by a phase factor that depends on the wavelength and the angles of light incidence and scattering. Depending on the phase difference, these contributions may interfere constructively (contributing to a bright band) or destructively (contributing to a black band). In the case of illumination by white light the patterns produced by different wavelengths are slightly misaligned with each other and that results in a coloring of the rings. The pattern is most noticeable around the reflection image of the light source. The closer the images of the light source and the observer are on the mirror and the closer the particles are to the reflective surface, the broader are the interference fringes. ==Gallery== Photographs of Quetelet rings on a mirror covered with talcum powder.

The Kraken will compete in the National Hockey League (NHL) as a member of the Pacific Division in the Western Conference, beginning with the league's 2021‚Äì22 season. The team is owned by Seattle Hockey Partners, consisting of David Bonderman, Jerry Bruckheimer, and Tod Leiweke. In December 2018, the NHL approved a proposal by Seattle Hockey Partners to grant an expansion franchise to the city of Seattle. In July 2020, the Kraken's name and branding were revealed. It will be the first professional hockey team to play in Seattle since the Seattle Totems of the Western Hockey League played their last game in 1975, and the first Seattle hockey team to compete for the Stanley Cup since the Seattle Metropolitans, who folded in 1924. The team will play at Climate Pledge Arena, a new $930 million arena under construction at the site of the former KeyArena, which had previously been optimized for basketball to suit the former Seattle SuperSonics of the National Basketball Association (NBA). == Background == === History of hockey in Seattle === alt= Professional ice hockey in Seattle dates back to the formation of the Pacific Coast Hockey Association (PCHA)'s Seattle Metropolitans in 1915. The 1917 Metropolitans were the first United States-based team to win the Stanley Cup, but folded in 1924, while the Seattle Totems played in the minor Western Hockey League (WHL) from 1944 until the WHL's dissolution in 1975. On June 12, 1974, the NHL announced that a Seattle group headed by Vince Abbey of the Totems had been awarded a tentative expansion team to begin play in the 1976‚Äì77 season along with a team in Denver. The team, which according to season ticket promotions would have kept the WHL name of Totems, never came to fruition because of the original WHL's instability (the WHL was shut down the day the potential NHL team was announced), the inability of Abbey to gather the necessary funding and meet deadlines, and the poor performances on the ice and at the box office of 1974 expansion teams the Washington Capitals and the Kansas City Scouts. Abbey later came up short in bid to purchase the Pittsburgh Penguins and move the team to Seattle when they were sold in a bankruptcy auction for US$4.4 million in June 1975. The NHL quickly rescinded the expansion offer and Abbey filed a lawsuit against the NHL, which he lost, and ended up paying the Vancouver Canucks over US$600,000 in damages. A second attempt at an NHL expansion team in Seattle by a local group was made in 1990, but it failed again over the financial terms the NHL demanded. Then-Seattle SuperSonics owner Barry Ackerley committed to submitting an expansion application to the NHL by a September 15, 1990 deadline as part of a proposed new arena deal, provided that a group could be found willing to meet the NHL's asking price of $50 million. His son Bill, President of the Ackerley Group, worked with Bill Lear of the First National Bank of Chicago, in order to find an ownership group for the prospective franchise. The only group to step forward was led by Microsoft executive Chris Larson and former Seattle Totems player then coach Bill MacFarland. Ackerley and the Larson/MacFarland group met multiple times, but the Larson/MacFarland group determined that the expansion franchise was worth $15 million less than what the NHL was asking for. Ackerley advised that the only application they would be party to was one that met the NHL's $50 million threshold. As a result, when Bill Ackerley and Bill Lear met with the NHL's Board of Governors on December 5, 1990, they advised the group that they (Ackerley) were unsuccessful in finding an ownership group that was willing to meet the NHL's asking price, and so they were, out of respect to the Board of Governor's and their process, withdrawing their application. However, they also advised the Board that there was a Seattle Group, Larson/MacFarland, that wanted to present their offer to the Board, but the Ackerley group was not be party to that effort. As a result, the Seattle bid was denied as the NHL was able to find two markets (Ottawa and Tampa Bay) willing to meet their price. Larson and MacFarland represented to the Seattle media that it was the Ackerley Group that cost Seattle a chance at an NHL team, but in fact it was Larson and MacFarland's unwillingness to meet the NHL's expansion price.Bill Ackerley A US$50 million expansion fee was more than any NHL club was valued at the time; a US$5 million down payment that would be forfeited if 10,000 season tickets weren't sold in the first year ‚Äî the SuperSonics had never sold more than 9,000 season tickets; season tickets needed to produce at least US$9 million annually, which would've made the tickets the second most expensive for a team in the area at the time; a 20-year lease with a \\"substantial\\" share of arena revenues from concessions, parking, and ad signage; priority status for postseason arena dates; and a secured US$5 million line of credit in case the league had to take over ownership of the team at any point was also required. As a result of these factors, Seattle was unable to secure an NHL franchise as part of its efforts to build a new arena. KeyArena post-1995 hockey configuration Later talks about a NHL team for Seattle were derailed by KeyArena. While originally built with an acceptable ice hockey configuration that was used by the WHL Totems, the largest arena in the Seattle area was considered problematic for NHL hockey from the 1995 to 2018 due to renovations taking place in 1994 and 1995 that were tailored to the arena's major tenant at the time, the NBA's Seattle SuperSonics. Notably, the sight lines for ice hockey left much to be desired. The scoreboard was significantly off-center in the arena's new ice hockey configuration, and so many lower-bowl seats were obstructed that half the lower bowl had to be curtained off for ice hockey. This was a major factor in the major junior Seattle Thunderbirds leaving for their own building in Kent in 2009. In 2012, League deputy commissioner Bill Daly stated that KeyArena would be \\"a difficult arena for hockey\\" due to the large number of obstructed- view seats. All NHL exhibition games held in Seattle after the renovation were instead hosted at the Tacoma Dome 30 miles south of Seattle due to the issues KeyArena presented with its altered ice hockey configuration. Expansion and relocation proposals often came with a new arena proposal, especially after the SuperSonics relocated to Oklahoma City, Oklahoma in 2008. From 2012 on as the NHL's interest in Seattle as a market rose, the city was positioned as a locale for expansion or a relocating team pending a viable arena. Multiple reports suggested Chicago Wolves owner and businessman Don Levin had expressed interest in building a new arena in nearby Bellevue that could host an NHL team. On February 16, 2012, a plan was announced to build a new arena in Seattle's SoDo district, just south of Safeco Field. An investment group, headed by hedge-fund manager Chris Hansen, proposed the arena seeking a return of the SuperSonics and was interested in possibly having an NHL team as well. When Greg Jamison was unable to meet a deadline to purchase the Phoenix Coyotes on January 31, 2013, speculation began that the team would be relocated to Seattle. On June 16, 2013, it was confirmed that the Phoenix Coyotes would be moving to Seattle if an arena deal between the team and the City of Glendale was not reached. Ray Bartozek and Anthony Lanza would purchase the franchise for US$220 million and immediately begin operations in Seattle for the following season. However, on July 3, 2013, the Glendale City Council narrowly voted 4‚Äì3 to keep the Phoenix Coyotes in Glendale. A 2013 study by Nate Silver concluded that Seattle had the largest number of avid ice hockey fans of any U.S. media market that did not have an NHL team. The Puget Sound region's highest level of ice hockey participate in the Canadian major junior leagues: the Seattle Thunderbirds, based south of Seattle in Kent, and Everett Silvertips, north of Seattle in Everett, both play in the current incarnation of the WHL. === Establishment of the team === thumb Seattle mayor Jenny Durkan celebrating the city's expansion team On December 4, 2017, the Seattle City Council voted 7‚Äì1 to approve a memorandum of understanding between the city of Seattle and the Los Angeles-based Oak View Group, co- founded by Tim Leiweke, for renovations of KeyArena. Renovations for the arena were proposed to begin in 2018 and expected to be fully completed in 2020. The current KeyArena roof will remain in place as it is considered a landmark. The rest of the building will see a complete renovation with land being dug down and out. While the renovations are intended for acquiring an NHL franchise, acquiring a new SuperSonics basketball team was also within the design of the approval. On December 7, the NHL's board of governors agreed to consider an expansion application from Seattle, with an expansion fee set at US$650 million. The Seattle ownership group was represented by David Bonderman and Jerry Bruckheimer, who conducted a preliminary season ticket drive to gauge interest in Seattle. On February 13, 2018, the Oak View Group officially filed an application with the NHL for an expansion team and paid a US$10 million application fee. At the time, the earliest a Seattle NHL expansion team could have begun playing was the 2020‚Äì2021 season pending the completion of arena renovations. On March 1, 2018, a ticket drive began to gauge interests in season ticket deposits. Oak View reported that their initial goal of 10,000 deposits was surpassed in 12 minutes, and that they received 25,000 deposits in 75 minutes. On April 11, 2018, Tod Leiweke was named CEO of Seattle's NHL expansion team. On June 18, 2018, Dave Tippett was named as a senior advisor. Another step towards an expansion team was taken on October 2, 2018, when the NHL Executive Committee unanimously agreed to recommend the expansion bid to a vote of the Board of Governors in December. The NHL Board of Governors voted unanimously to approve Seattle's expansion team on December 4, 2018. Seattle will begin play in the 2021‚Äì2022 season as a member of the Pacific Division in the Western Conference; therefore the Arizona Coyotes will shift from the Pacific Division to the Central Division to balance out the four divisions at eight teams each. An expansion draft will be held in a similar manner to a previous expansion draft held in 2017 for the Vegas Golden Knights, who will be exempt from it. In May 2019, the team launched an interactive \\"fan portal\\" where fans can weigh in on the team name and uniform colors, answer poll questions, get information about ticket pricing and seating, and view a timeline of past and future key events involving the club and a section that spotlights some of the season-ticket depositors. On July 18, 2019, Seattle announced that it had hired former Carolina Hurricanes general manager Ron Francis as the team's first general manager. On September 30, 2019, the team announced that its minor league affiliate in the American Hockey League (AHL) would be based in Palm Springs, California. Due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, the affiliate will not begin play until the 2022-23 season. On July 23, 2020, the franchise officially announced their team name, the Seattle Kraken, as well as their team colors, branding, and home jersey. The event was held under the banner of \\"Release the Kraken\\", a phrase popularized by the 1981 film Clash of the Titans and the 2010 remake. \\"Kraken\\" was a name that was already popular with fans prior to its official adoption. The franchise's promotional materials state that it was adopted to honor the maritime culture of Seattle, as well as in reference to the giant Pacific octopus, the largest species of octopus in the world, which can be found in the waters of the Pacific Northwest. == Team information == === Broadcasting === On August 7, 2020, the Kraken announced that Everett Fitzhugh would serve as the team's play-by-play announcer.

She is best known for The Botticelli Trilogy, which is set in late fifteenth-century Florence. ==Early life and career== Proud was born in Hertfordshire and was an only child. As a young girl, she enjoyed making up stories, and at age 14 she discovered the historical fiction of Mary Renault. Renault would become one of her chief influences as a writer. Proud began her career as a picture researcher in 1971, during which time she developed an interest in the works of Florentine painter Botticelli. She also became interested in and influenced by the work of Renaissance philosopher Marsilio Ficino. It was during this time that she developed the idea behind The Botticelli Trilogy and began researching Renaissance Florence. However, after the digitization of images, she left her career as a picture researcher to begin teaching creative writing to American students at the University of Oxford. She also served as an editor for literary consultancy The Writers Workshop. ==Writing career== Proud's early work primarily included non-fiction books on culture, spirituality, and art. Her first fictional publication, Knights of the Grail (1995), is a retelling of the Arthurian legend for children. Proud finished A Tabernacle for the Sun (1997, 2005), the first volume of her trilogy, which was published through Allison & Busby. A Tabernacle for the Sun was long-listed for the Mann Booker Prize (1997) and won a Southern Arts bursary and a Hawthornden Castle Fellowship. In 2000, Proud and her husband founded their own publishing house, Godstow Press, which specializes in publishing works on art and spirituality. All her subsequent historical fiction, including the next two volumes of her trilogy, Pallas and the Centaur (2004, 2012) and The Rebirth of Venus (2008), has been released under the imprint of Godstow Press. After finishing her trilogy, it was suggested to Proud that she write a book about Cosimo de' Medici, and in 2012 she published A Gift for the Magus, which serves as a prequel to The Botticelli Trilogy. A Gift for the Magus won a second prize Indie B.R.A.G. Medallion and the Quagga Prize for Independent Literary Fiction. It was also marked as an Editors' Choice book by the Historical Novel Society. Altogether, the process of writing The Botticelli Trilogy took over thirty years. Proud bases much of her writing closely on primary sources. Her writing has been compared to H. F. M. Prescott, Mary Renault, and Marguerite Yourcenar. In recent years, Proud has lectured on Renaissance philosophy and questioned the boundaries between historians and novelists in History Today. She has also written several articles and reviews for Resurgence & Ecologist. She also leads regular writing workshops and gives talks on writing and publishing. In September 2018 she marked a departure from the Renaissance with the publication of a novel, Chariot of the Soul, set in Britain on the eve of the Roman invasion. ==Personal life== Proud lives in Oxfordshire with her husband. She is a student of Neoplatonism and Advaita Vedanta, the latter of which she practices on a daily basis. ==Bibliography== ===Non-fiction=== * Consider England, illus.

Growing up, she attended Gahr High School in Cerritos, California, before dropping out her sophomore year to be homeschooled, so she can focus on her modeling career. Herrington came from a working family. She describes her childhood as normal and says she was focused on school until college. ==Career== Herrington started envisioning herself as a professional model at the age of 8. She attended John Casablancas' modelling school at age 10 or 11 with the encouragement of her mother. She began modelling at age 13, and Herrington was featured in GQ in November 2016 before she had 10,000 Instagram followers as an Instagram model on the rise who had already done jobs for Victoria's Secret.

Emperor Taizong (598-649) commissioned the famed Tang military officer Li Jing (ÊùéÈùñ, 571‚Äì649), along with Li Shiji, Wei Xiaojie, Li Daozong, Chai Shao (), and Xue Wanche () to attack forces under the command of Illig Qaghan (Ashina Duobi), leader of the Eastern Turkic Khaganate (also known as the G√∂kt√ºrks), a nomadic confederation of Turkic peoples based in Inner Asia. The battle ended in defeat for the G√∂kt√ºrks and resulted in the dissolution of the Eastern Turkic Khaganate, which was eventually replaced by the Protectorate General to Pacify the North, otherwise known as the Anbei Protectorate () in 647 CE after the Tang dynasty definitively conquered the Xueyantuo. == Background == In 623, The Eastern Turkic Khaganate began a campaign of routine pillaging incursions into Tang territory, while continuing to protect Liang Shidu, who claimed the title of Emperor of Liang. In 626, Li ShiMin succeeded Emperor Gaozu as Emperor Taizong of the Tang. Less than a month later, the Turkic ruler Ashina Duobi (Illig Qaghan) and his nephew, Ashina Shibobi (), invaded Tang territory, advancing all the way to the ancient capital Chang'an, shocking the Tang officials. Emperor Taizong was forced to personally meet with them at the Wei River Bridge outside Chang'an, give them and major Eastern Turkic officials gifts, and promise further tributes. Only after he did so did Ashina Duobi and Ashina Shibobi withdraw. For the next several years, there was relative peace between the Tang and the Eastern Turkic Khaganate. Meanwhile, Ashina Duobi's territory suffered two unusually cold winters that led to mass livestock deaths and famine and he was forced to suppress a number of rebellions. By 627, Emperor Taizong contemplated taking advantage of Ashina Duobi's weakened state by launching an attack, but ultimately refrained after his advisers convinced him not to break the peace. Internal strife within the Eastern Turkic Khaganate continued as vassal tribes became restless under Ashina Duobi's rule. Ashina Duobi and Ashina Shibobi also fell into conflict after the latter was unable to defeat rebellious Xueyantuo and Uyghur vassal tribes. After Ashina Duobi attacked Asina Shibobi's forces in 628, Emperor Taizong, who had sworn to be a blood brother of Ashina Shibobi on a prior occasion, agreed to launch troops to protect Ashina Shibobi‚Äîand at the same time use the opportunity to attack Liang Shidu, who by this point was still under the Eastern Turkic Khaganate's protection. Liang Shidu was assassinated in 628, ending the final rival claim to Emperor Taizong's for China's imperial throne. To head off Taizong's efforts to ally with rebellious vassal tribes against him, Ashina Duobi sought long-term peace in the form of a marriage to a Tang princess, which Emperor Taizong did not answer. Instead, he prepared for a major assault on the Eastern Turkic Khaganate, with the major general Li Jing commanding and with the general Zhang Gongjin () assisting Li Jing. == Battle == In spring 630, Li Jing, employing six separate cavalry formations of nearly 100,000 men along a 1,200 km front, captured the Wuyang Range outside Dingxiang (ÂÆöË•Ñ, in modern Hohhot, Inner Mongolia), approaching Ashina Duobi's court. He then sent spies to Ashina Duobi's camp and persuaded a number of his close associates, including Kangsumi (), to surrender (along with Sui's Empress Xiao and her grandson Yang Zhengdao). Li Jing's nighttime assault on the walls of Dingxiang forced Ashina Duobi to withdraw to Iron Mountain (Tieshan) in the Yin Mountains where he offered to submit to Emperor Taizong‚Äîbut while he was negotiating with the Emperor Taizong's envoy Tang Jian (), he was also considering withdrawing further north of the Gobi Desert. Li Jing and Li Shiji, believing that Ashina Duobi was merely stalling for time, joined their forces and their vanguard, Su Dingfang, attacked Ashina Duobi's encampment on March 27, 630, defeating him and killing his wife (Sui Dynasty's Princess Yicheng). Ashina Duobi fled further to his subordinate khan Ashina Sunishi (), but was soon captured by the Tang generals Li Daozong and Zhang Baoxiang () and delivered to Chang'an. Turkic nobles largely surrendered to Tang, while the Turkic Khaganate's people scattered in three directions‚Äîeither surrendering to Tang, surrendering to the Xueyantuo, or fleeing west to the Western Turkic Khaganate and the nearby kingdoms such as Qocho, Kucha, and Tuyuhun. == Aftermath == Emperor Taizong eventually decided to have the Eastern Turkic Khaganate's people settled in the northern prefectures within Tang borders, remaining in tribal form, on lands that were currently not settled. He established four nominal prefectures over Ashina Shibobi's tribes and six nominal prefectures over Ashina Duobi's tribes, with two commandants governing the areas. Ashina Sunishi and another Eastern Turkic Khaganate prince, Ashina Simo (who, in particular, was given the Tang imperial surname Li and therefore also known as Li Simo), were created princes, and a large number of other chieftains were given general ranks; they were settled in or near Chang'an. Emperor Taizong also gave the Eastern Turkic Khaganate's people who possessed Han people as slaves ransoms and had them return those Han slaves to Tang. Also thereafter, Emperor Taizong often requisitioned Turkic cavalry soldiers to supplement regular Tang troops on various campaigns, such as the 634 campaign against Tuyuhun. Meanwhile, Xueyantuo largely took over Eastern Turkic Khaganate's former territory, with most of Eastern Turkic Khaganate's former vassals submitting to it. Former Eastern Turkic Khaganate's vassals Khitan, X√≠ (), and Xƒ´ () tribes directly submitted to Tang, as did the city-state of Yiwu (). == References == Category:Battles involving the Tang dynasty Category:G√∂kt√ºrks Category:Emperor Taizong of Tang Category:630 Category:History of Hebei Category:History of Mongolia Category:History of Imperial China ","title":"Battle of Yinshan"},{"id":"56584332","text":"Sucker Lake is a lake in geographic La Salle Township and geographic Osborne Township in the Unorganized North Part of Nipissing District in Northeastern Ontario, Canada, about east of the railway point of Diver on the Ontario Northland Railway.

She was the host of the news program Todo Noticias since 1996 and the program Arriba Argentinos since its inception in 2005. == Childhood and adolescence == Since she was a child, P√©rez Volpin dreamed of studying medicine, influenced by her father who was a director of the Juan A. Fern√°ndez Hospital in the city of Buenos Aires. On top of this, she also wanted to pursue a career in social communication sciences. She completed her secondary studies at Colegio Nacional de Buenos Aires, where she had her first experience in communication. Here, she contributed to the realization of the school magazine. According to P√©rez Volpin, this publication was very prestigious as a means of information for students. == Early Career == After she finished high school, in mid-December, she decided to enroll for the medicine career she would begin in March of the following year. However, she decided to start her career in social communication and when she studied semiology, she realized that her true vocation had leaned towards the latter. Her first job in the media was as a producer on Radio Belgrano (es), while she was still studying at the university. It was about a magazine with Enrique V√°zquez that aired at 7:00 a.m.. He made contributions to graphic media such as the 13/20 magazine for young people. She worked for associate editors who published magazines such as Ser √önica, Emanuelle, and a whole series of magazines in which she worked as an editor. She made collaborations for the newspapers La Naci√≥n and Clar√≠n. == Producer in Artear == In 1992, P√©rez Volpin joined Artear (es) with a group of young journalists that were working as interns. The entrance requirements were that they should have been graduates of a communication school and had some experience in the media. She, like all of the group that had entered, began in production and was under the orders of Ricardo Pipino whose function was to form the new channel that was going to be released, Todo Noticias. The first task of P√©rez- Volpin was to call the various television channels in Argentina to explain that there would be a news channel, 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. When something happened in some locality or city of an occurrence, the channel that was in that locality had to send the coverage of the news to Artear. During a whole year, she went through different areas of production. == Reporting Career == P√©rez Volpin's desire was to be a chronicler on the street. She earned this position one summer, where she replaced chroniclers who had taken vacations. She was a reporter for four years where she worked from early in the morning to late at night. Her role was to be on the street with a cameraman and to send the material they produced for another person to edit and then broadcast to the public. Then, she started making mobiles and special reports for Telenoche. == Hosting Career == In 1996, she became a host of Todo Noticias. As a host -when she did not do it alone- she worked with Jos√© Antonio Gil Vidal, Mario Mazzone, Juan Micelli, Guillermo Lobo, Luis Otero, Santo Biasatti and Marcelo Bonelli. From 2004 to 2005, she conducted S√≠ntesis with Juan Miceli. P√©rez Volpin also worked in Canal (√°) with the shows Anecdotario (2003‚Äì2009) and Entre Par√©ntesis. She hosted Seg√∫n como se mire in Radio Mitre (2008). On 25 April 2005 the morning news program Arriba Argentinos began, and P√©rez Volpin was chosen as a host along with Juan Miceli. Other hosts included Marcelo Bonelli, Marcelo Fiasche, Alejandra Pe√±alva y Nazarena Di Serio. Said newscast is the most watched in its strip. Her fans created forums on different websites and groups on Facebook where they uploaded photos and videos of the host. On 21 June 2017, she quit to Canal 13 after 24 years ‚àí12 years as the host of the program- and Todo Noticias to be a candidate to the Legislature for the city of Buenos Aires. == Political Career == In 2017, she entered in politics and was elected legislator of the City of Buenos Aires as part of the Evoluci√≥n front led by Mart√≠n Lousteau. She came third in the election with 12% of the votes and took office on 10 December of that year but she was only able to participate in one session of the legislature on 22 December 2017, when the budget of the City of Buenos Aires was approved, before her passing. == Death == On Monday, 5 February 2018, she entered the Trinidad Sanatorium of the city of Buenos Aires, which determined she had a \\"complex abdominal condition.\\" On 6 February, she underwent an upper digestive endoscopy and suffered a cardiac arrest that caused her death. The journalist's family went to court and presented a complaint to dispute the claims of the sanatorium and on 7 February Judge Gabriel Ghirlanda determined P√©rez Volpin's was a \\"wrongful homicide\\". After conducting an autopsy in the judicial morgue her remains were veiled in the Buenos Aires legislature on 8 February with public access between 2 and 10 pm, which was attended by four thousand people. She was buried next to her father, Aurelio P√©rez Flores, in the Pantheon of the Asturians of the Chacarita Cemetery. In April, after the resignation of Judge Gabriel Ghirlanda, the criminal case was left to his colleague Carlos Burniard. On 19 June 2018, endoscopist Diego Bioalolenkier and anesthesiologist N√©lida In√©s Puente were indicted, the only two individuals charged in the case. The Court also ordered the arrest of both professionals for the sum of 1.7 million pesos each. ==References== Category:1967 births Category:2018 deaths Category:Argentine women journalists Category:Argentine television journalists Category:Argentine women in politics Category:21st- century Argentine politicians Category:21st-century women politicians Category:20th-century journalists Category:21st-century journalists Category:Politicians from Buenos Aires Category:University of Buenos Aires alumni Category:Members of the Buenos Aires City Legislature Category:Women city councillors Category:Argentine people of Jewish descent Category:Women television journalists ","title":"D√©bora P√©rez Volpin"},{"id":"56584543","text":"Heavy Meta (stylized as HEAVY META) is the second solo studio album by Ron Gallo, released on February 3, 2017. == Reception == Heavy Meta score of 72 out of 100 on the online review aggregate site Metacritic, indicating \\"Generally favorable reviews\\".\\" == Track listing == == Charting == * \\"Young Lady, You're Scaring Me\\": No. 30 Adult Alternative Songs, No. 46 Mediabase Alternative == Personnel == * Produced by: Joe Bisirri & Ron Gallo * Mixed by: Joe Bisirri * Recorded by: Joe Bisirri * Mastered by: Ryan Schwabe * A&R;: Kim Buie == References == Category:2017 albums Category:Ron Gallo albums Category:New West Records albums ","title":"Heavy Meta (Ron Gallo album)"},{"id":"56584553","text":"The Mayflower was a Canadian flat-bottom steamer that sank on November 12, 1912. Built in Combermere, Ontario in 1903, the Mayflower was a wooden 77-foot-long ship and was powered by two steam engines that drove a single paddle wheel in her stern. It was traveling from Barry's Bay to Combermere to deliver the body of John Brown to his brother-in-law (a local Combermere city councillor). On that night, it sank on Kamaniskeg Lake in a winter storm, losing nine lives. Three managed to survive by staying afloat by clinging onto the casket that carried John Brown. Eventually they reached a small island called Gull Island (now known as Parcher Island) and built a fire using the debris and wreckage that had washed ashore. It was reported worldwide at the time by Ripley's Believe it or Not. This tragedy marked the worst inland maritime disaster in Canadian history at the time.

The series is executive produced by Wolf, Dan Powell, Christine Nangle, and Daniel Bodansky. Powell and Nangle also act as showrunners for the series. On August 17, 2018, it was announced that Netflix had canceled the series. ==Premise== The Break with Michelle Wolf was designed to \\"take a break from the seriousness of late-night comedy\\" and \\"instead of making the news fun, she‚Äôll make fun of everything and everybody. There will be no preaching or political agenda ‚Äî unless it‚Äôs funny.\\" ==Production== On February 12, 2018, it was announced that Netflix had given the production a series order consisting of ten episodes and expected the show to begin airing sometime in late 2018. The series was set to star Michelle Wolf who also executive produces alongside Dan Powell, Christine Nangle, and Daniel Bodansky. Powell and Nangle were also expected to act as showrunners for the series. Wolf's production company Cats in Pants was expected to produce the series as well. ==Cancellation== On April 11, 2018, it was announced that the show had been titled The Break with Michelle Wolf and that it would premiere on May 27, 2018. On August 17, 2018, it was announced that Netflix had declined to renew the series, reportedly due to low viewership, effectively canceling it. ==Episodes== ==Release== On April 28, 2018, the first trailer for the series was released following Wolf's hosting stint at the 2018 White House Correspondents Dinner.

On the review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, the first season holds a 77% approval rating with an average rating of 8 out of 10 based on 13 reviews. The website's critical consensus reads, \\"The Break With Michelle Wolf has room for improvement, but this late- night show is a welcome break from the norm.\\" Early critical reviews of the series premiere were largely positive. In a positive review, The Globe and Mails John Doyle offered the series commendation saying, \\"This is more laid- back, low-key, absurdist feminist humour. It's wickedly entertaining, coming out of left field into a very crowded arena.\\" In another favorable assessment, The Guardians Charles Bramesco said, \\"Wolf's pilot episode prophesies a brief period of growing pains in pursuit of an individual identity, and grand dividends once it's complete.\\" In an additional approving analysis, Varietys Caroline Framke said, \\"Whether she‚Äôs tearing down a politician, scoffing at a sexist institution, or telling her audience it deserves a break (pun intended) before speeding away on a tricycle, Wolf is always grinning with delight that she gets to do it all on her own weird terms. Not every joke has to land for the show to be even half as much fun as Wolf is clearly having.\\" In a more negative critique, Ken Tucker of Yahoo! TV was less enthusiastic about the series' premiere episode saying, \\"It wasn't a very auspicious debut; Wolf's standup comedy was OK but not hilarious, and her taped segments demonstrated a tendency to repeat the same joke over and over.\\" Summarizing his opinion of the series as a whole, Darren Franich of Entertainment Weekly published a review of the series before the premiere of its season finale where he gave it a grade of \\"B+\\" and praised it saying, \\"Jokes won‚Äôt fix everything. But whoever said comedy had to do anything? At its best, Wolf‚Äôs show has been an earnest plea to keep laughing.

Thousands of protestors marched, blocked highways and shut down state-owned gas stations. The rise in price‚Äîknown in Mexico as the ‚Äîwas a result of president Enrique Pe√±a Nieto's privatization of the Mexican oil industry. Other factors that led to the protests include high inflation, a weak peso, widespread violence due to the Mexican Drug War, and Pe√±a Nieto's low approval rating and corruption allegations. ==Background== On 26 December 2016, the Mexican government announced that gasoline prices would rise by up to 20% in January as result of the transition towards eliminating price controls. Beginning with the Mexican oil expropriation in 1938, the government controlled the country's entire petroleum industry, including both production and retail sales. The state-owned company, Pemex, held a monopoly on all gasoline sales in the country, and prices were set by the government. In 2013, the newly-elected President Enrique Pe√±a Nieto began the process of privatizing Mexico's oil industry, which would eventually allow private companies to establish their own gas stations. The Mexican government planned to transition to market prices gradually throughout 2017. Finance Minister Jos√© Antonio Meade explained that the price hike was \\"an important change,\\" which would \\"allow prices to reflect costs, and avoid artificial distortions.\\" The rise in gasoline prices was also a result of the government ending subsidies to the oil industry and may have been motivated by projected budget deficits because of the Mexican peso's weakening value relative to the US dollar. The price hike, scheduled to begin on 1 January 2017, coincided with an economy marked by high inflation in addition to the weak peso. Donald Trump's recent election as president of the United States led to uncertainty, as he had campaigned on strong economic protectionism. Furthermore, Pe√±a Nieto was experiencing historically-low approval ratings and was involved in numerous scandals. Tensions in Mexico were also raised by the high homicide rates associated with the continued Mexican Drug War, which had begun over ten years earlier. ==Protests== Protestors in Mexico City on 9 January 2017 Protests began on 1 January, the same day the new prices took effect. Activists used social media to organize protests and shut down gas stations throughout the country. Protestors also blockaded major highways and border crossings. Their demands included cheaper gasoline prices as well as the resignation of president Pe√±a Nieto. Protests and riots took place all over the country. Demonstrations in Tijuana and Nogales forced authorities to temporarily close Mexico‚ÄìUnited States border crossings. In Rosarito, a man intentionally drove his vehicle into federal police officers. Looting was reported in Veracruz. In Tabasco, a convenience store was ransacked and burned. Mexico City had two large demonstrations in early January, with thousands of protestors in attendance. Over 250 stores were looted during the protests. At least one police officer was killed while trying to prevent looting. At least four deaths have been attributed to the protests, as well as 1,500 arrests. ==See also== *Gasoline and diesel usage and pricing *Petroleum industry in Mexico *Pemex *Yo Soy 132 ==ReferencesPress release by the Secretariat of Finance and Public Credit about the gasoline price increases of 2017 Category:2017 in Mexico Category:2017 protests Category:Petroleum industry in Mexico Category:Protests in Mexico Category:Tax resistance ","title":"2017 Mexican protests"},{"id":"56584654","text":"The is a long river that flows through Saitama and Tokyo, Japan.

In April 2018, a video showed purported action by Philippine embassy officials rescuing Filipino maids from allegedly abusive employers. Kuwait protested that the action challenged their sovereignty.

Understanding the purpose of the summons, Atticus immediately retired to his bed chambers where he killed himself. Meanwhile, the soldiers detained his guests for hours, only allowing them to leave \\"at a late hour of the night\\". Tacitus notes that Nero had \\"laughed over their terror at the expectation of a fatal end to their banquet\\" before saying \\"that they had suffered enough punishment for the consul's entertainment\\" and giving the order to release them. == References == Category:1st-century Romans Category:Imperial Roman consuls Category:Year of birth unknown Category:65 deaths Category:Members of the Pisonian conspiracy Vestinus Atticus ","title":"Marcus Julius Vestinus Atticus"},{"id":"56585026","text":"Md.

The organisation was founded in 2014 in response to violence in Jerusalem at the time. It aims to reduce racism and tension in the city. Runners Without Borders groups, composed of Jews and Arabs, meet for joint training sessions on a weekly basis. In addition to the training sessions, the groups take part in a social activity once per month. Delegations from Runners Without Borders youth teams have attended international races in Europe, and represented Jerusalem as a team in Milan (April 2015), Berlin (August 2015), and London (September 2016). Additionally, Runners Without Borders' teams have participated in the Jerusalem Marathon every year since it was founded. ==History== The initiative started as a collaboration between Israel Haas, a resident of Jerusalem, and Shoshana Ben-David, a Jerusalem-based high school student. Runners Without Borders initially created a joined running team for Jewish and Arab girls between the ages of 14-19, who came from a wide range of neighbourhoods in east and west Jerusalem. In light of the girls‚Äô group's success, a parallel boys‚Äô group was founded, followed by Arab-Jewish running groups for men and women above the age of 20. In June 2015 Runners Without Borders‚Äô youth groups planned to attend the Jerusalem Municipality's night run, but were forced to cancel their participation when they discovered that the race was scheduled to take place during the first night of Ramadan. In response, Runners Without Borders created its own race. The first Jewish-Arab race put on by Runners Without Borders took place between Beit Safafa and Malha (in south-west Jerusalem), with 87 participants. They produced two additional races along this route, and in March 2017 launched the first ever Jewish-Arab race in east Jerusalem, which took place between the Arab neighbourhoods of Abu Tor and Jabel Mukaber. Since then Runners Without Borders have produced three races in East Jerusalem, with over 700 runners in the November 2017 race. ==References== ==External links== * Category:Youth organizations based in Israel Category:Running clubs Category:Non-profit organizations based in Israel Category:2014 establishments in Israel ","title":"Runners Without Borders"},{"id":"56585079","text":"The 2018 CBA Playoffs was the postseason tournament of the Chinese Basketball Association's 2017‚Äì18 season.

It is located adjacent to the railway line in western Victoria‚Äôs vast wheatbelt 560 upright poles, some 80-foot-long, went into building the cathedral-like structure. Many more poles went into fabricating the roof trusses and bracing. The slender mountain ash poles were probably salvaged from native forests at Powelltown, Noojee and Erica burnt during the 1939 bushfires.Forests Commission Victoria Annual report The Murtoa Stick Shed, as it became known, is 870 feet long, 198 feet wide and 62 feet 10 inches high at the ridge, covering an area of 170,000 square feet and with a capacity of 3.4 million bushels or 95,000 tonnes. Australia experienced a wheat glut in the late 1930s as traditional export markets of Great Britain and Western Europe evaporated due to a shift in world trade and restrictions to shipping. By the outbreak of the War in 1939, the Australian wheat industry produced between 150 and 160 million bushels per year, of which 100 million had been traditionally exported. But only 48 of the 160 silos planned under the 1935 Victorian Silo Scheme had been completed. The Murtoa Stick Shed was hurriedly built over four months between September 1941 and January 1942 and filled with grain within six months of its construction. The wheat stayed in storage until 1944. It was the first emergency bulk wheat storage shed built in Victoria and is the only one remaining of its type in Australia. Wartime shortages meant the builders had to rely upon and adapt traditional bush construction techniques. It‚Äôs claimed to be the largest ‚Äúrustically-built‚Äù structure in the world. The Forests Commission Victoria (FCV) produced over half a million lineal feet of poles from State forests mainly for emergency storage of wheat in 1941/42.

The final was contested by Cuala of Dublin and Na Piarsaigh of Limerick, with the game ending in a 1-22 to 2-19 draw. The replay took place on 24 March 2018, with Cuala winning by 2-17 to 1-17. The All-Ireland final was a unique occasion as it was the first ever championship meeting between Cuala and Na Piarsaigh. Cuala were appearing in their second successive final and were hoping to retain the title, while Na Piarsaigh were lining out in their second All-Ireland decider ever and their first since 2016. Na Piarsaigh appeared to be cruising to victory as added-time approached, but Se√°n Moran fired a 63rd minute free to the net to force extra-time. David Treacy came to the rescue at the death after both teams battled it out for 20 minutes of extra-time. David Breen goaled for the Limerick champions in the first period of extra-time, but points from Con O'Callaghan and Mark Schutte ‚Äì both of whom had been held scoreless until then ‚Äì and Treacy‚Äôs 12 frees ensured a second shot for Cuala. The replay a week later saw Cuala take a slender 0-10 to 0-09 lead at half-time. The game turned in Cuala's favour in the 39th minute when Tommy Grimes' stray hand pass was intercepted by Nicky Kenny and punished for a goal. Mark Schutte seized possession from the puck-out and took off on a solo run down the left before slamming the ball to the net for a second. Cuala led 2-11 to 0-11 and looked to be in pole position to retain their crown, however, Na Piarsaigh were at the very best in the final quarter. Cuala surrendered a six-point lead during this period to trail Na Piarsaigh by one with 60 minutes played. Con O'Callaghan scored the point that levelled the game for the eighth time, then won a free that top scorer David Treacy converted and finally laid off a pass after a great catch for Mark Schutte to hit the insurance score for Cuala.

The film stars Irrfan Khan, Kirti Kulhari, Arunoday Singh and Divya Dutta in lead roles and is produced by Bhushan Kumar, Krishan Kumar, Apurba Sengupta and Rohit KaduDeshmukh under the banner of T-Series Films and RDP Motion Pictures. Blackmail depicts the life of a married-man in his late 30s stuck in a full day-time job and unexciting life but things turn after he finds that his wife is having an extramarital affair. The film had its theatrical release in India on 6 April 2018 and turned out to become a moderate box office success. ==Plot== Dev Kaushal (Irrfan Khan) is a toilet paper sales executive who is leading a dispirited life both professionally and personally. He steals the photographs of other men's wives for his personal pleasure and gratification. One day, to surprise his wife Reena Kaushal (Kirti Kulhari) he arrives early from office with roses but instead finds his wife in bed with another man named Ranjit \\"Tommy\\" Arora (Arunoday Singh). He imagines different scenarios, like killing the lover, then killing the wife, but leaves and decides to blackmail him. Ranjit is a hen pecked husband married to Dolly Verma (Divya Dutta), who has an influential dad, who Ranjit is scared of. Dev shares a great bond with his Boss DK (Omi Vaidya) who asks him to promote the new toilet rolls. After calculating all the things he has to pay, Dev blackmails Ranjit for a sum of 1 lakh. Ranjit arranges the money from Dolly by lying of starting a business. When Dolly's father asks Ranjit to return the money, he blackmails Reena for 120,000. In a drunken state, Dev reveals everything to his colleague Anand (Pradhuman Singh Mall). Reena asks Dev for money, saying that its for her dad's treatment. Dev gives her the money and in turn asks Ranjit for more money. Reena keeps the money in a dust bin which Ranjit collects and leaves it in a trash bin which Dev then collects. Anand, who has a crush on Prabha Ghatpandey (Anuja Sathe), a newly appointed colleague gets her on a date and unintentionally reveals Dev's plans. Next day Prabha blackmails Dev for money. Dev confronts Anand but then asks Ranjit for money, Ranjit in turn asks Reena for money and Reena asks Dev for the money. From the cash received earlier Dev transacts the amount to Reena's account, while Reena puts the money in a dustbin. Ranjit collects it, and throws it in a dustbin which Dev collects and gives to Prabha. Ranjit gets fed up and hires a detective, Chawla (Gajraj Rao). Prabha blackmails Dev for more money. Dev decides to meet Prabha and they share a heated argument in her apartment. Prabha slips during the argument and falls as an entire shelf falls on her, killing her. Suddenly Prabha's parents arrive. Dev manages to escape by wearing mask made out of a Paper bag and runs outside wearing only shorts while being chased by nearby residents. Next morning following Prabha's death, police arrive and interrogates everyone in the office. Anand knowing that Dev met Prabha last night, blackmails Dev. On interrogation Dev reveals that Anand used to like Prabha. Dev convinces Anand to hide the truth from the police. Using Anand's car Dev purchases a similar paper bag he used last night to escape and hides it in Anand's car, following which the police arrest Anand. Anand panics and reveals everything about Dev to the police. Meanwhile, Chawla calls Dev telling him he knows about his ruse while Ranjit manages to get a gun to kill The Blackmailer. The police then interrogates Dev about his blackmail activities. Dolly follows Ranjit and sees him together with Reena. Anand comes out of Police custody and tries to beat Dev but Dev manages to calm him down, claiming he has a master plan to gain money. Dev meets Chawla who asks for money to remain silent. At their home Dolly tries to kill Ranjit, but Ranjit manages to shoot her dead and hides her body in a Refrigerator. Dev asks Ranjit for money so that he can pay Chawla. In turn Ranjit asks Reena for money and Reena asks Dev for money claiming that its for her father's surgery. Dev calls Reena's parents and finds out that she is lying. He follows Reena, sees her selling her ornaments and puts the cash in the bin at a Mall. Dev goes to take it, but Ranjit comes over there and takes the money. Dev takes pictures of Ranjit taking the money. Ranjit hides the money in the dustbin and waits there to catch the blackmailer. Dev sees Ranjit watching and bribes a security guard to take the money. Ranjit follows him as Dev collects the money and gives it to Chawla. He asks Chawla for a favour, so he calls Ranjit and tells him the blackmailer is Anand. Ranjit kills Anand and Dev sends the pictures of Ranjit to Reena. Meanwhile, Dolly's parents find out that Ranjit murdered their daughter and lock him up in a bathroom and call the police. Reena messages Dev asking when he will come home for dinner. A depressed Dev receives the message and deletes Reena's contact, while winning a computer game he always failed at, suggesting that he's ready to divorce Reena after all this madness. Next morning, his boss DK sees that all his promotional tactics for his toilet paper has failed as some other company has taken over his company, which is implied to be Dev's as he is not at work.

In January 2015, it was reported that Rakesh Roshan would be producing Abhinay Deo's next film which would have Irrfan Khan and Aditi Rao Hydari as the lead actors playing husband and wife. Kunal Kapoor, Kunaal Roy Kapur and Vijay Raaz were also signed on to be a part of the project and the shooting was supposed to begin at the end of February. In June 2015, it was reported that Rakesh Roshan had dropped the project that he was doing with Abhinay Deo citing creative differences. One year later in August 2016, Abhinay Deo informed that after he completes the work on Force 2, he plans to revive the film that he was supposed to do with Irrfan Khan before it got shelved. In November 2016, Abhinay Deo's film was given a working title of Blackmail and in February 2017 it was confirmed that T-Series had come on board to produce the film along with Co-Producer Rohit KaduDeshmukh. In April 2017, it was reported that the title of the film had been changed to Raita and Kirti Kulhari would be playing the role of Irrfan's wife in the film instead of Aditi Rao Hydari who was the first choice of the director. The principal photography of the film began on 4 April 2017 and the entire shoot was done in Mumbai itself. In December 2017, the film was officially renamed as Blackmail and it was announced that the film would have its theatrical release on 30 March 2018. ==Promotion== After the special screening for Amitabh Bachchan on 31 March 2018, the makers organised another special screening on 2 April 2018 in the absence of lead actor Irrfan Khan (who was undergoing treatment for neuroendocrine tumour in UK) for contemporary bollywood film directors, which was attended by Rajkumar Hirani, Amol Gupte, Nishikant Kamat, Ashutosh Gowarikar, Tanuja Chandra, Meghna Gulzar, Ravi Udyawar, Rensil D'Silva, Sudhir Mishra, Sriram Raghavan, Soumik Sen, Pradeep Sarkar, Mukesh Chhabra and others, to a positive response. ==Soundtrack== The album is a compilation of six tracks, four of which were composed by Amit Trivedi while the other two songs were composed by the guest musicians Badshah and Guru Randhawa. The lyrics of the songs were written by Amitabh Bhattacharya, Badshah, Guru Randhawa and Divine. The entire music album was officially released on 23 March 2018. Guru Randhawa recreated his track Patola, originally composed by Preet Hundal. ==Critical reception== Rajeev Masand gave the film a rating of 3 out of 5 and said that, \\"It‚Äôs the film‚Äôs unique brand of humor ‚Äì some of it pitch black and Coen-esque ‚Äì that makes Blackmail worth your time, despite its shortcomings.\\" Sweta Kausal of Hindustan Times gave the film a rating of 3 out of 5 and said that Blackmail is a \\"Fun filled and realistic story-telling made interesting with engaging and hilarious performances of Irrfan Khan and Divya Dutta\\". Rachit Gupta of The Times of India gave the film a rating of 4 out of 5 saying that, \\"The plot of Blackmail is its hero and it manages to strike a good balance between dark and funny. This is one of the most wickedly funny films that we‚Äôve seen in a long time.\\" Raja Sen of NDTV gave the film a rating of 1.5 out of 5 and said that, \\"Irrfan is incapable of giving a bad performance but Abhinay Deo's farce is too tacky and poorly-conceived to do Khan justice\\". Shubhra Gupta of The Indian Express gave the film a rating of 2 out of 5 and said that, \\"The Irrfan Khan starrer begins promisingly but descends pretty quickly into flatness and sluggishness, a classic problem of not knowing quite how to play out a perky idea.\\" ==ReferencesCategory:Films scored by Amit Trivedi Category:T-Series films Category:Films featuring an item number Category:Indian black comedy films Category:Indian films Category:2018 black comedy films ","title":"Blackmail (2018 film)"},{"id":"56585538","text":"Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 is a smartphone developed by Xiaomi Inc.

She was built at Wuchang Shipyard of China. She is the third corvette of the class for the Bangladesh Navy. ==Career== The Bangladesh Navy signed a contract with the China State Shipbuilding Corporation for second batch of two C-13B version of Type 056 corvettes on 21 July 2015. The ships were laid down at Wuchang Shipyard on 9 August 2016. BNS Shongram was launched on 12 February 2018 and handed over the ship to the Bangladesh Navy on 28 March 2019. She began her delivery voyage from the port of Shanghai, China to Bangladesh on 12 April 2019, with stops at the Yantian port in China and the Port Klang in Malaysia, reaching Chattogram on 27 April 2019. Shongram was commissioned into the Bangladesh Navy on 18 June 2020. On 9 August 2020, she departed BNS Issa Khan for Lebanon to join UN peacekeeping operations UNIFIL. On her way to Lebanon, she made a port call at Mormugao Port of India on 17 August, 2020. She will take over from BNS Bijoy which was damaged in the Beirut explosions. ==Design== The ship is long, has a beam of and a draught of . With a displacement of 1,300 tonnes, she has a complement of 78 personnel including 60 sailors and 18 officers. She is propelled by two SEMT Pielstick 12PA6 diesel engines with a distance adjustable tail rotor which can provide enough power for her top speed of more than . She has two power stations, forward and rear, and electricity supply works with one of the power station sunk. Compared to the traditional round bilge boat, the ship is designed with V type, having angle bending line at the bottom so that she can sail with high speed in rough sea states. However, the ship does not carry any type of sonar so she has limited anti-submarine warfare capability. As a result, she will act mainly as a surface warfare corvette. BNS Shongram has a helicopter deck aft which can support a medium-size helicopter, but she has no hangar. ===Electronics=== The ship uses Chinese SR2410C S-band 3D AESA radar for surface and air search purposes. This radar can also be used for helicopter landing control and as a fire control radar. The radar has a detection range of and has the capability to track 150 targets per rotation. According to Chinese sources, this radar is analogous to the SMART-S MK2 radar of Thales. ===Armaments=== The ship carries one H/PJ-26 76 mm main gun placed forward. Two 2-cell C-802A anti-ship missiles are installed in the ship for anti surface operations. Two H/PJ-17 30 mm remote controlled gun turrets at amidship work as gun-CIWS for the ship. For air defence, she carries an eight- cell FL-3000N launcher, which is the Chinese equivalent of RAM. The ship also carries two 6-cell Type-87 240mm ASW rocket launchers. ==See also== *List of active ships of the Bangladesh Navy *Type 056 corvette ==References== Category:Ships of the Bangladesh Navy Category:Corvettes of the Bangladesh Navy Category:2018 ships ","title":"BNS Shongram"},{"id":"56585638","text":"Park Je-un (born 11 March 1993) is a South Korean Nordic combined skier who competes internationally.FIS profile He competed at the 2018 Winter Olympics. ==References== Category:1993 births Category:Living people Category:South Korean male Nordic combined skiers Category:Olympic Nordic combined skiers of South Korea Category:Nordic combined skiers at the 2018 Winter Olympics Category:South Korean male ski jumpers Category:Olympic ski jumpers of South Korea Category:Ski jumpers at the 2018 Winter Olympics ","title":"Park Je-un"},{"id":"56585686","text":"Zo√´ Brock is a model and writer from New Zealand. == Early years == Brock was born in 1974 in Christchurch, New Zealand, and emigrated to Melbourne, Australia, in 1986. == Modelling and acting career == Brock started modelling when she was 14 years old.

He graduated High School in 1980 in the rural community of Des Lacs, ND. ==Career== In 1999, Nicholas Ressler and Anderson formed Awesome 2 Productions in Mandan, ND. The company does video production work for car shows and other events. During this time, the two were curious about what was going to happen with all the memories on video tapes. So in 2007, they developed a new company called Zoovio, which transcodes video tape to a digital format which is stored in a private, online vault, and can be played back on any smart device and connected television. In Jan 2013, Anderson started the radio talk show known as \\"The Tech Ranch\\". In addition to the weekly talk show, The Tech Ranch covers events such as CES. Anderson who is also known as the ‚ÄúGuru of Geek‚Äù is a frequent contributor to regional and National news stories in the technology space. His holiday top tech gifts are an annual favorite and are featured far and wide. Anderson is also an Advocate for Autonomous Vehicles ‚Äì most notably the Autonomous Friendly Corridor. This idea came about in response to the lack of north‚Äìsouth avenues to move commercial goods in the middle part of the U.S. Anderson is a Central North American Trade Corridor Director. CNATCA first made its idea for the Autonomous Friendly Corridor public on March 20, 2014. In his capacity as a CNATCA Director, Anderson is often quoted for his optimism about the future and the current technologies that are revolutionizing the transportation industry. While hosting the Association for Unmanned Vehicle Systems International Roadshow in May 2015, he said, ‚ÄúIt gets people thinking ‚Äòwhat if.‚Äô It opens eyes and minds to the possibility of what is going to be available in a couple of years.‚Äù Anderson‚Äôs zeal for the future is balanced with his propensity to preserve the past. This is evident in his TedX UMary talk of 2017 entitled ‚ÄúOur Bright Future,‚Äù in which he discusses the lessons we can learn from our early 20th century ancestors as they grappled with the issue of horse manure. Wasting astronomical resources on a problem that was soon solved through the technological advancement of the ‚Äúhorseless carriage‚Äù is a parallel to our present day transportation issues at the dawn of the autonomous age. The self proclaimed futurist has also spoken at Tedx Fargo on the topic for which he is best known, his National Day Calendar motto of Celebrate Every Day. As chairman of the Mandan Independence Day Parade for nearly 25 years, Anderson has seen such distinctions as the World's Longest Chicken Dance (1.6 miles ) in 2010 and in 2012 being a finalist in the Rand McNally Most Patriotic City competition. Anderson's Talking Trail. Encouraging travelers of the Old Red/Old Ten Scenic Byway between Mandan and Dickinson to slow down and discover some 39 points of interest, Talking Trail invites participants to call the phone number and extensions listed on signs marking the historical sites located along this 108-mile road, known since 2008 as the 10th Federal Highway Administration Scenic Byway in North Dakota. Anderson hopes to promote a sense of discovery for these sites which include statues in Mandan of Peter Toth, honoring Native Americans and Theodore Roosevelt all the way to the old Fort Keogh Trail, which was once crossed by Lt. Col. George Armstrong Custer in 1870 when he marched the Seventh Cavalry to Montana. As acting president of the North Dakota Music Hall of Fame, Anderson oversaw the creation and installation of the public art display at Dykshoorn park in downtown Mandan, ND, entitled ‚ÄúNorth Dakota Music Lane‚Äù which celebrates four North Dakota Music Hall of Fame inductees including Lawrence Welk, Bobby Vee, Peggy Lee and Lynn Anderson. Anderson is one of the founders of the 1 Million Cups chapters in North Dakota. He is also a founding committee member and 2017 moderator for the DisruptWell Summit in Bismarck, ND. DisruptWell is a conference featuring disruptive technologies in the fields of transportation, healthcare, energy, and education. Anderson serves on several boards in his own community of Mandan, ND and as recently as 2018 became one of the 22 committee members for the West End Redevelopment Committee which seeks to redevelop the Thrifty White Drug and Central Market Properties. ==National Day Calendar== On January 19, 2013, Anderson founded the National Day Calendar. The site quickly became a popular destination for media wanting to know more about how the National Days came to be. Anderson's team has also been responsible for creating close to 200 new National Days including National Astronaut Day and National Bobblehead Day. Over 20,000 media outlets and personalities follow Anderson's daily post and use his content as prep for their daily shows. National Day Calendar has turned unknown holidays such as National Pizza Day and National Coffee Day into a trending topic on social media.

It is a small herb that grows in subalpine and alpine habitats above 900m throughout Tasmania, and bears edible fruit. It is commonly known as the native strawberry or Tasmanian alpine raspberry. == Taxonomy == The name Gunnianus comes from the botanist Ronald Campbell Gunn. Gunn worked closely with Ronald Lawrence; who knew British botanist Joseph Hooker. The authority of this species was named after Hooker. Gunn travelled around Tasmania, collecting specimens and sending them back for Hooker's book \\"Introduction to Flora Tasmaniae\\". Over 50 Tasmanian plant species gained Gunn's name, but a number of names would have since been changed over the years. == Description == Rubus gunnianus is the smallest of all the species in the family Rosaceae. It grows as a small, prostrate herb in alpine habitats throughout Tasmania. When mature, the plant can spread by sending out runners to make the plant larger, as well as by setting seed. Unlike other species of the genus Rubus, this species does not have any thorns or spines. The leaves grow out from the stem as a florette, and are triangular and glossy green. The palmately compound leaves are composed of three pinnatipartite leaflets (one main one flanked by two smaller ones either side), with very long petioles. Rubus gunnianus is bisexual (having both male and female organs on the same flower), and the flowers are small, white, with five petals. Members of the family Rosaceae are well known for producing edible fruit, which is suitable for bush tucker.Distribution of Rubus gunnianus, map from the Atlas of Living Australia Flowers and buds of Rubus gunnianus. Photo courtesy of R. Wiltshire == Distribution and habitat == Rubus gunnianus is found in mountainous areas such as alpine moorlands, and subalpine woodlands across Tasmania, including areas such as the Central Coast, Derwent Valley, Hobart, Huon Valley and the West Coast. It is frost hardy, which is essential to alpine environments, due to the harsh weather and exposed conditions at high altitude. It prefers moist, sheltered areas among mosses and leaf litter, where it can survive the harsh conditions of alpine areas, but it can also survive in semi-exposed areas. Mt Field, Tasmania. Photo courtesy of R. Wiltshirecenter == Uses == 191x191px The red, raspberry-looking fruit is edible; and is made up of a few drupes. A purple dye can be made from the fruit juice. Members of the genus Rubus are well known for their nutritional benefits of being high in vitamins and nutrients such as vitamin C, potassium, magnesium, iron and copper, while being low in sugar. This species is suitable for domestic cultivation, and R. gunnianus may be a good choice for people with limited space to grow plants, because it is quite small and would take up little room. It can also be grown in pots. R. gunnianus requires well drained moist soils, part shade to full sun, and is suitable in a variety of soil types in alpine and subalpine areas. == Conservation status == Rubus gunnianus has not yet been assessed for the IUCN Red List, however, it is quite common in alpine habitats throughout Tasmania; therefore no conservation concern is required at present. ==References== gunnianus Category:Flora of Tasmania ","title":"Rubus gunnianus"},{"id":"56585846","text":"Paudie Feehan is an Irish hurler who plays as a forward for the Tipperary senior team.

(29 March 1867He was the son of Jean-Louis Thomas and Marguerite Evesque. ‚Äì 6 November 1943 in the 7th arrondissement of Paris)He died there at the Clinique Saint Jean de Dieu, but was domiciled 71 in the 16th arrondissement of Paris, was a French tenor and lyrical singing professor. == Biography == Born in G√©n√©rac, Gard department, Eustase Thomas- Salignac was the son of a coffee maker. Initially trained in lyrical singing in Marseille, the city of his childhood, he was a prize-winner of violin and singing. He then joined the Conservatoire de Paris where he followed the courses of Victor Alphonse Duvernoy and won the prize for op√©ra comique by singing the role of Don Jos√© in Bizet's Carmen. Strengthened by this viaticum, he began in 1893 at the Op√©ra-Comique in Richard C≈ìur-de-Lion. The following season, his career took on an international dimension, straddling the United States and Great Britain. He made himself known there as the principal tenor of the French lyrical repertoire of his generation. After a tour in the northeast of the country, he made his debut at the Metropolitan Opera of New York on 11 December 1896, performing Don Jos√© in Carmen, where he responded to the already famous soprano Emma Calv√©. At the end of the season, he returned to London where he sang at Covent Garden from 1897 to 1899. He performed again at the Metropolitan Opera of New York from 1898 to 1903, alternating with Covent Garden where he performed from 1901 to 1904. Returning to France in 1905, Salignac sang at the Op√©ra-Comique for the following years, taking up his favourite role of Don Jos√© for his return to the national stage. Recruited to the post of director of the in 1912, he gained experience as a show business owner. He became a singing teacher at the American Conservatory of Fontainebleau in 1923, and was the mentor of the American tenor Charles Kullman.John Potter: Tenor History of a Voice, Yale University Press, 2008. From 1924, he taught the course of lyrical declamation at the Conservatoire national de musique et de d√©clamation. Apart from a short interlude at the head of a French lyrical troupe touring Canada and New York in 1926, Salignac remained faithful to this house where he completed his career. Among the students who followed her instruction was the singer Solange Michel. A renowned professor, he was admitted to retirement on 1 October 1936. Between the two World Wars, Thomas-Salignac was heavily involved in professional bodies working for the defence and promotion of lyrical art. In March 1922, he founded the periodical Lyrica,Lyrica on data.bnf.fr \\"revue mensuelle illustr√©e de l'art lyrique et de tous les arts\\", which he directed until hits handover in March 1939. President of the Professional Union of French Masters of Singing from 1926 to 1939, he was also the founding president of the Acad√©mie du Chant, a \\"grouping for the technical and scientific study of Voice and Singing\\", in 1929. A renowned and generous artist, he had among his friends, in addition to many professionals of lyrical singing, novelist Roland Dorgel√®s. Under the Nazi occupation, he compromised himself by sitting as a member of the Music Section Executive Committee (chaired by composer Max d'Ollone) from the Groupe Collaboration.Yannick Simon : Composer sous Vichy, √©ditions Sym√©trie, 2009, 432 p. Officer of Academy and Public Education, he had been decorated chevalier of the L√©gion d'honneur on 9 March 1936.Archives Nationales: ¬´ Cote L19800035/1306/50944 ¬ª, base L√©onore, minist√®re fran√ßais de la Culture. == Roles and publications == Esteemed lyrical tenor, Salignac essentially visited the classical repertoire of the Op√©ra comique. He also practiced the works of contemporary creators. Interpreter regularly requested by Jules Massenet (title role of Werther, roles of Jesus in Marie-Magdeleine in 1906 and the chevalier des Grieux in Manon, premiere of Sapho in the 1909 version), he was part of the opera cast of Raoul Laparra (premiere of La Habanera and La Jota), Charles-Marie Widor (premiere of Les p√™cheurs de Saint- Jean,Les p√™cheurs de Saint-Jean on Musopen in 1905), Guy Ropartz (premiere of Le Pays, in 1913) and Darius Milhaud. He sang the title role in Henri Rabaud's M√¢rouf, savetier du Caire when it was revived in 1917-1918. He created Manuel de Falla's chamber opera El retablo de Maese Pedro, performed in the private theatre of the princesse de Polignac in 1923. In the opinion of an American critic at Salignac's American debut at the Metropolitan Opera in New York as Don Jos√©, \\"he is not a man of broad body and imposing appearance, and his voice lacks strength and volume.... His diction is a little fast, but he sings with accuracy and feeling\\". The artist's performances were marked by a southern accent that was appreciated by the public. The oldest recorded fragment of his voice is included in the Mapleson Cylinders. In the single excerpt containing his voice, Salignac can be heard along with Marcella Sembrich in a portion of the love duet from Donizetti's La Fille du r√©giment, under the direction of Philippe Flon, during the performance given on 30 January 1903. With Louis Merlet, Salignac composed with four hands the libretto of an opera put to music by Louis Merlet. Albert Wolff: Le Marchand de masques, lyrical drama in two acts. The work was premiered in 1914 at the casino municipal de Nice and its booklet published in Paris by Enoch. (1914, 39 p.).

It was copper fastened, sheathed with felt and yellow metal. The ship required repairs in 1856 and 1861 for damage incurred while in operation. During its early years of service it was sailed from Liverpool to destinations in South America and was sailed to Australia arriving in 1859. It was operating as a whaler out of Hobart in 1871, owned by Captain John McArthur and William Andrews. The ship struck a whale on 21 November 1872 while en route from Hobart to Albany. After tying the whale to the side of the vessel it proceeded to Frenchman's Bay where it anchored to process the whale. The following night a gale rose from the southeast and it broke two anchor cables and foundered close to shore at Goode Beach. A total of 70 tuns (66,775 litres) of sperm oil, the sails, rigging, whaling equipment, provisions and other contents were recovered from the wreck and shipped to Hobart for auction.

He is remembered today for his long tenure as Luitenant der Chinezen (or government- appointed head mandarin) of Bekasi, and for his interracial marriage with Louisa Zecha. Born in Batavia, Lauw Tek Lok was the son of the early nineteenth-century tycoon Lauw Ho (died in 1863), part of the powerful Ngo Ho Tjiang opium partnership. His father was an important revenue farmer, and served as Wijkmeester (ward master) of Meester Cornelis. The younger Lauw became one of the most important landlords ('Landheeren') in Batavia with significant agricultural landholdings ('particuliere landen') in the city's Ommelanden (the then rural hinterland of Batavia), including the estate of Cimanggis. Lauw was appointed on December 23, 1854 to the newly-created government post of der Chinezen of Bekasi, a civil administrative position he would keep until his death in 1882. At the same time, his brother Lauw Tek Kang was also raised to the post of Luitenant der Chinezen of Meester Cornelis. As Luitenant, Lauw Tek Lok played a significant role in the Dutch colonial development of Bekasi and its surrounding region. On his death in 1882, Lauw was succeeded as Luitenant der Chinezen of Bekasi by another local landlord and his son-in-law, Tan Kang Ie. Despite his satisfactory records as a colonial administrator, Lauw caused some consternation among the colonial authorities due to his unconventional and interracial marriage with an Indo woman of Bohemian descent, Louisa Zecha. Together, they became the ancestors of the prominent Lauw-Sim-Zecha family, and were the great-grandparents of Adrian Lauw Zecha, founder of Aman Resorts. ==References== Category:1882 deaths Category:Indonesian people of Chinese descent Category:Lauw-Sim-Zecha family Category:Kapitan Cina Category:Cabang Atas Category:People from Jakarta Category:People from Bekasi Category:Indonesian landlords ","title":"Lauw Tek Lok"},{"id":"56586352","text":"The Roter Graben is a river of Saxony, Germany.

She was one of the first two women elected as Tunbridge Wells councillors. == Early life == Amelia Scott was born in Byfleet, Surrey on 16 January 1860, the fourth child of Syms Scott and his wife, Ellen (n√©e Nicholls). Her father was Clerk to the Lord Chamberlain of London and the family were reasonably prosperous, employing in 1861 three servants, a housemaid, nursemaid and cook.England Census, 1861 By then they had moved to Southborough, near Tunbridge Wells, where Amelia‚Äôs youngest sister, Louisa, was born in 1862. Syms Scott died while his children were still young and their mother later remarried.A. Logan, ‚ÄòScott, Amelia, 1860-1952‚Äô, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography (2018) By 1881 Louisa and Amelia were living with an aunt and their grandmother, the three of them being attended to by a cook and three maids.England Census, 1881 Amelia Scott‚Äôs background was therefore comfortably middle class ‚Äì her aunt and grandmother were described as ‚Äòliving on own means‚Äô ‚Äì although the family was not exactly wealthy. Her maternal grandmother was the widow of a clergyman and there is clear evidence of Amelia‚Äôs own religious belief and commitment. After their grandmother‚Äôs death Amelia and Louisa Scott set up home together, living in several premises in the Tunbridge Wells area, before finally settling in Lansdowne Road where they lived with another sister, Florence. None of the woman married but they lived in respectable residences and could afford to employ one servant. Together with their siblings, they each inherited a share of their father‚Äôs estate and the sisters do not seem to have needed to take on paid work. But budgets were necessarily tight as their income was limited.A. Logan, ‚ÄòLady Bountiful or Community Activist? Amelia Scott (1860-1552), Women‚Äôs History Magazine (Spring 2010) == Social work == There is very little evidence of Amelia Scott‚Äôs initial education or of the first thirty or so years of her life, although she probably participated in conventional philanthropic, Church-related activities such as running mothers‚Äô meetings and teaching Sunday school classes. She had a strong, Anglican faith and in 1898 her book, Women of Sacred History, was published. In 1894 Scott attended a conference of the National Union of Women Workers (NUWW) at Bristol. This event was an epiphany: ‚Äò[i]n those days in Tunbridge Wells we lived in our own small, self-satisfied circles, both in religion, politics and class,‚Äô she later recalled. ‚ÄòAt Bristol I walked into a wholly different atmosphere, and it was an atmosphere where I would be‚Äô.History of the National Council of Women in Tunbridge Wells for the last 35 years (1931), p.4 Inspired by this conference, she formed an NUWW branch in Tunbridge Wells, holding the initial meeting in her own home and serving as its secretary for over thirty-five years. At the first meeting, the well-known workhouse reformer, Louisa Twining (who had retired to Tunbridge Wells) took the chair.Kent and Sussex Courier, 31 May 1895 Twining, who was a Poor Law Guardian (PLG) for the Tonbridge Union, must have encouraged Scott to follow in her footsteps, as in 1901 Amelia was elected a PLG. Scott also undertook social work training in London provided by the Charity Organisation Society (COS). In 1906 the Tunbridge Wells NUWW branch, under her direction, hosted the national NUWW conference in the town‚Äôs new Opera House. Pembury Workhouse Mortuary appeal As a PLG Scott not only regularly inspected the workhouse premises at Pembury but also visited people for whom the Union was responsible including those who had been sent to the County Asylum at Barming, near Maidstone. She served on the Union‚Äôs Finance Committee as well as the Children‚Äôs Committee, the House Committee and the Mental Deficiency Committee. Her career as a PLG continued until 1930 when the Board‚Äôs functions were transferred to the Kent County Council‚Äôs Public Assistance Committee. According to a semi-autobiographical work about the ending of the Poor Law entitled The Passing of a Great Dread, Scott learnt a great deal from her experience as a PLG, not least from her dealings with a female vagrant to whom she gave the pseudonym ‚ÄòElspeth‚Äô.A. Scott, Passing of the Great Dread (Typescript, Women‚Äôs Library), p.21 Her Poor Law work also opened her eyes to the needs of new mothers, both married, and unmarried; as well as those of young, sick and elderly workhouse inmates. Among the service improvements she championed was the construction of a proper mortuary, complete with space for the grieving relatives of the deceased. Amelia Scott‚Äôs social activism focused primarily on the needs of young, working class women and mothers. Among her many local community projects was a hostel for working women, opened in Tunbridge Wells in 1913. Along with many NUWW activists, she had become concerned by the lack of housing provision for poor working class single women and children, other than mixed common lodging houses. The Tunbridge Wells NUWW branch raised funds to take over and refurbish a former inn and reopen it as the Crown Hostel for Women and Children. In 1931 it was reported to house 100 women and 50 children in a week.Kent and Sussex Courier, 6 February 1931 Scott, together with her sister, Louisa and other local NUWW members also established a social club for working girls (particularly laundry workers) in Upper Grosvenor Road, Tunbridge Wells. Called the ‚ÄòLeisure Hour Club for Young Women in Business‚Äô, it opened its doors in 1900 and remained active for nearly twenty years. The club was supported by local philanthropists and ran excursions on bank holidays as well as holding club evenings.https://www.kent.ac.uk/sspssr/womenshistorykent/themes/workingwomen/leisurehourclub.html During the First World War it was joined by the ‚ÄòComrades‚Äô Club‚Äô, where young women were able to socialise with young soldiers, under the watchful eyes of the women volunteers.Kent and Sussex Courier, 6 February 1931 == Women‚Äôs suffrage == Like many politically active women of her generation, Amelia Scott became an avowed supporter of women‚Äôs suffrage. In 1905 the Tunbridge Wells NUWW branch held a discussion on the subject of votes for women and Scott was among those who spoke up in favour.Kent and Sussex Courier, 12 May 1905 At the 1906 NUWW annual conference in Tunbridge Wells a memorable, heated debate on women‚Äôs suffrage took place, chaired by the national suffrage leader, Millicent Fawcett. Great Pilgrimage, procession through Royal Tunbridge Wells From 1908 Scott was an official of Tunbridge Wells‚Äô non-militant women‚Äôs suffrage society which was affiliated to the National Union of Women‚Äôs Suffrage Societies (NUWSS), and which had a shop and offices in Crescent Road, Tunbridge Wells. Amelia Scott took part in peaceful demonstrations for women‚Äôs suffrage, once carrying a banner from the Thames Embankment in London to the Royal Albert Hall.Kent and Sussex Courier, 6 February 1931 In 1913 she became involved in the non-militant suffrage ‚Äòpilgrimage‚Äô to London organised by the newly formed Kentish Federation of Women‚Äôs Suffrage Societies. She gave speeches en route, including at the Victoria Hall, Southborough. Her leaflet bag, emblazoned in the NUWSS colours of red and green, is now kept at the Women‚Äôs Library. Scott supported suffrage because she believed that women should play a part in changing the law, especially with regard to morality. In other words, the vote was not for her an end in itself, but a means to an end. She told her audience at the Victoria Hall, ‚Äòwe women claim our right to political power in order that we may better carry it out.‚Äô Furthermore, she expressed feminine solidarity: ‚Äòthe degradation of any woman is the degradation of all,‚Äô she claimed. Scott‚Äôs feminism was thus rooted in her experience as a social activist as well as her religious faith. ‚ÄòMen and women TOGETHER form humanity‚Äô she claimed, ‚Äòin God our Creator there is neither male nor female... the distinction is purely physical, not spiritual.‚ÄôA. Scott, speech for Victoria Hall, July 1913 (Typescript, Women‚Äôs Library) == First World War == During the First World War the Tunbridge Wells NUWW ‚Äì still with Amelia Scott as its Hon Secretary ‚Äì got involved in establishing voluntary women police patrols in the town and in running canteens for soldiers billeted in the area. In 1915 at the request of a military commander, Scott and her helpers opened a laundry service for washing and mending soldiers‚Äô kits. At its height the laundry was dealing with up to 20,000 garments a week.A Logan and C. Lee, ‚ÄòTunbridge Wells Women in the First World War‚Äô in The Shock of War ed. J. Cunningham (Tunbridge Wells Civic Society, 2014), p. 140 Meanwhile, the former suffrage society offices were transformed into a depot for donations of clothing. After the war Amelia Scott attended a Buckingham Palace garden party for women war workers on account of the soldiers‚Äô laundry which she had managed from 1915 to 1918. Soon after the outbreak of war, as an influx of refugees from Belgium came to Britain, Amelia and Louisa Scott both became members of the Tunbridge Wells committee set up to welcome and assist the refugees. The Scott sisters and the other ladies on the committee must have been generous with their help for the refugees since in 1916 they were all presented with souvenir album autographed by members of the Belgian ‚Äòcolony‚Äô in Tunbridge Wells.A. MacKenzie, ‚ÄòThe \\"Scott\\" Album (2017) https://blogs.kent.ac.uk/rtwbelgians/2017/06/01/the-scott-album-by-alison- mackenzie/ The album presented to Amelia and Louisa jointly as ‚ÄòMesdemoiselles Scott‚Äô is preserved in the Women‚Äôs Library in London. Amelia was also awarded the Order of the Golden Palm by the King of Belgium for her help to the refugees. As well as the Armistice, 1918 saw the passage of the Representation of The People Act, which gave the parliamentary vote to some women. In December, these women got their first chance to vote in a general election and on polling day Amelia Scott took part in a procession of women through Tunbridge Wells to the Town Hall.A Logan and C. Lee, ‚ÄòTunbridge Wells Women in the First World War‚Äô in The Shock of War ed. J. Cunningham (Tunbridge Wells Civic Society, 2014), p. 161 == Post-war == In 1918 the NUWW became the National Council of Women (NCW). Amelia Scott remained the local branch secretary and its members continued their active, local political campaigns. In addition, NCW women founded a Women‚Äôs Citizens‚Äô Association, dedicated to the political education of newly enfranchised women. Amelia Scott was a leading member of this new organisation. In 1919, Amelia Scott and her friend and colleague, Susan Power, became the first two women to be elected to the borough council of Royal Tunbridge Wells. Scott received almost 40 per cent of the votes cast in her ward.https://www.kent.ac.uk/sspssr/womenshistorykent/themes/biogs/a-scott.html As a councillor she campaigned for the appointment of women police, for better housing and for the provision of municipal services such as a museum and library. However Scott‚Äôs main local, post-war campaign was for a maternity home, together with a hostel and day nursery for the children of widows, deserted wives and unmarried mothers. The project was intended as a thank offering for victory in the war. This was partially successful when in 1924 sufficient money had been raised to purchase two adjoining properties for the maternity home.https://www.kent.ac.uk/sspssr/womenshistorykent/themes/post- war/maternityhome.html By 1936 one-third of local mothers were delivered of their babies at the home and Scott was still a member of its committee when it was absorbed into the National Health Service in 1948.Kent and Sussex Courier, 15 May 1936 & 14 May 1948 == National work == Amelia Scott‚Äôs influence was not restricted to the local area. She regularly participated at NCW Annual Conferences and served on its national executive. She also established a national committee of the NCW, called the Public Service Committee, and was its secretary for 17 years. An early campaign of the committee‚Äôs was for safe lodging houses for women (see above). In 1919, when women were allowed to become Justices of the Peace (JPs) for the first time, the committee ‚Äì previously just for women in local government ‚Äì became the Public Service and Magistrates Committee (PSMC). Under its new name the committee - still convened by Scott - campaigned for better treatment of women in police cells and for the employment of women JPs in juvenile courts.A. Logan, Feminism and Criminal Justice: A Historical Perspective (Palgrave, 2008) pp.25-7 Amelia Scott corresponded with many of the leading figures of the NCW including Louise Creighton (founding president and wife of a Bishop of London) and she worked closely with Florence Ada Keynes on the PSMC. Her high-profile correspondents also included Beatrice Webb, Eleanor Rathbone MP, Millicent Fawcett (suffragist leader) and Clementine Churchill.See correspondence in the Women‚Äôs Library Amelia Scott‚Äôs national work showed the same interest in the care of vulnerable women and children as her local work. In 1918, together with other interested parties, the NCW established the National Council for the Unmarried Mother and her Child (later the National Council for One Parent Families) and Amelia Scott was an early committee member. Unmarried mothers were, to say the least, a controversial cause in 1918, and her involvement reflects her care for those who were marginalised and stigmatised in society. == Retirement == Around 1930 Amelia Scott retired from most of her public activities. That year Boards of Guardians were abolished and the following year she stepped down as branch NCW secretary. However, her retirement was only partial and by 1932 she was back in charge of a Tunbridge Wells soup kitchen, opened to help the rising numbers of unemployed.Kent and Sussex Courier, 11 November 1932 Moreover, she remained Chairman of the hospital committee at Pembury. She also retained her interest in the care of refugees: in 1939 she signed a letter on behalf of the Tunbridge Wells Refugee Relief Committee appealing for help for refugees from Nazi Germany.Kent and Sussex Courier, 30 June 1939 In the 1940s Amelia Scott wrote a memoir focused on the transformation of the old workhouse into a modern, almost National Health Service hospital (called Passing of the Great Dread), which was eventually published in parts in the journal of the Family Welfare Association (formerly the COS). She was fond of handicrafts, including needlework and weaving, and she hand-knitted articles for the Seamen‚Äôs Mission. She retained her interest in the local hospital and its patients‚Äô welfare: only weeks before her death she sent some Christmas flowers to one of the hospital wards. == References == Category:1860 births Category:1952 deaths Category:British suffragists ","title":"Amelia Scott"},{"id":"56586544","text":"Cosmin Atodiresei (born 1 March 1994) is a Romanian luger.

Snow washing refers to hiding illegitimate financial transactions often for purposes of tax evasion in Canada. The term is an amalgam of the words snow meaning purity as well as the cold Canadian climate and washing referring to money laundering. It is easy under Canadian law to set up a company, even for a fee as low as $200 (Canadian), while shielding the identities of the firm's real owners from the eyes of tax authorities. The global elite, as well as criminals and foreigners avoiding economic sanctions, can set up shell companies to \\"make suspect transactions seem legitimate\\" under the cover of Canada's reputation for fiscal integrity. Vancouver are bought by anonymous foreigners as a way to evade taxes or do an end-around economic sanctions or launder money. The registration systems for Canadian companies, at both the federal level and the provincial level, are shrouded in secrecy, which means that the real owner of a company or a trust can hire a person as a stand-in substitute to conduct all financial filings and submissions. The practice effectively makes Canada a tax haven along with countries such as the British Virgin Islands, Panama and the Bahamas. The process has been made even easier since the Canadian government has signed tax treaties with 115 countries. With a form of business organization called a Canadian Limited Partnership, the only persons who have to declare themselves to the authorities are the partners, and if they do not live in Canada, they are exempt from filing taxes in Canada. For firms whose stocks are not traded publicly, the rules require that only the directors of such companies be identified, and these directors are not required to reveal whether they are acting on behalf of somebody else. There was a report in The Economist suggesting that the overheated market for private property in the Canadian city of Vancouver may be partially the result of purchases by unidentified persons, possibly foreign criminals and corrupt officials, as a way to launder dirty money. One estimate in 2009 by the national police was that C15billion was being laundered annually in Canada because of the opaque disclosure requirements. ==References == Category:Tax evasion Category:Money laundering ","title":"Snow washing"},{"id":"56586761","text":"Le√Øla Mezian Benjelloun is a Moroccan physician and businesswoman, and the wife of billionaire Othman Benjelloun. ==Early life== She is the daughter of Moroccan general Mohamed Meziane.

Ridgeway is an American sociologist and the Lucie Stern Professor of Social Sciences, Emerita in the Sociology Department at Stanford University. She is known for her research on gender and status processes, specifically on how large, societal-level gender and status inequalities are recreated in face-to-face interaction. Ridgeway served as president of the American Sociological Association in 2013. She also edited Social Psychology Quarterly from 2001‚Äì2003. == Education and career == Ridgeway received her Bachelor's degree with Honors and distinction in Sociology from the University of Michigan in 1967. She went on to receive her Master's and PhD in Sociology and Social Psychology from Cornell University in 1969 and 1972 respectively. She taught at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee from 1972‚Äì1985, attaining the rank of associate professor in 1978. She went on to teach at the University of Iowa from 1985‚Äì1991, and was instrumental in the development of their social psychology department. Her current position is at Stanford University. == Contributions == Ridgeway's contributions to the field starts with her publications on status and status theory. Ridgeway has written on nonverbal dominance cues and expectation states theory, looking at how both connect to and can be viewed through a status theory lens. Ridgeway is also known for her work on gender, and how it is a social status category. Her book, Framed by Gender: How Gender Inequality Persists in the Modern World, covers what gender inequality means in a modern context, how it is persisting in our society, and possible ways to change these inequalities. Ridgeway's most significant contribution to the field of study has been her creation of and subsequent empirical tests of status construction theory. Status construction theory looks at one set of processes by which status beliefs are created and shared within society. Status beliefs refer to the conceptions that are widely held about groups based on status markers such as sex or ethnicity. Ridgeway's work has been used to further research on inequality and the creation/perpetuation of inequality based on ones perceived status within society. == Awards == Ridgeway received the Cooley-Mead Award from the American Sociological Association in 2005 for her career contributions to social psychology. In 2009, Ridgeway received the Jessie Bernard Award for her work on gender inequality and her mentorship of younger, female academics. She won the Distinguished Feminist Lecturer Award from the Sociologists for Women in Society due to her feminist scholarship in 2008. In 2012, her book, Framed by Gender: How Gender Inequality Persists in the Modern World, received the Outstanding Recent Contribution In Social Psychology Award from the Social Psychology Section of the American Sociological Association. == Selected bibliography == === Notable books === * Ridgeway, C.

The film had its world premiere on 5 September 2018 in the main competition section of the 75th Venice International Film Festival. and was released online and in select theaters on 10 October 2018, by Netflix. ==Plot== On July 22, 2011, Anders Behring Breivik dresses in a police uniform, loads a van with home-made explosives, and drives to Regjeringskvartalet, the executive government quarter in Oslo, Norway. He leaves the van outside the office of Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg. Moments later, it explodes, causing several casualties. On the island of Ut√∏ya in Tyrifjorden, Buskerud, teenagers have arrived for Workers' Youth League (AUF) summer camp, organised by the ruling Labour Party. When they learn of the bombing, one student, Viljar Hanssen, calls his parents to make sure they are unhurt. Breivik arrives at the ferry landing and informs staff that he is a police officer, sent to secure the island following the attack in Oslo. The camp director transports him to the island by boat. Breivik instructs the staff to gather the children in one location. When the head of security asks for ID, Breivik shoots him and the director dead. The children flee as Breivik opens fire, murdering dozens. Viljar and his brother Torje hide on a rocky embankment on the beach. Viljar calls his mother to tell her a shooting is in progress. Breivik finds the group and starts shooting. Viljar is shot multiple times, but Torje escapes unharmed. Breivik surrenders to a tactical team, and is brought inland for interrogation. Breivik claims he is the leader of a white nationalist group called the Knights Templar and that more attacks will happen on his signal. He requests the aid of lawyer Geir Lippestad, who defended a Neo-Nazi. Lippestad is morally conscientious of his client and professionally bonded by his ethics as a lawyer. Lippestad tries to argue an insanity defense for Breivik, which draws criticism as it means he will be institutionalized instead of imprisoned. With the help of various psychiatrists and psychologists, Breivik is possibly diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia. Breivik tells Lippestad he wants to be declared competent to legitimize his attacks. Viljar wakes from a coma with life-changing injuries and returns home with his family. He learns to walk again, but is haunted by memories of the attack. With the support of his mother, and another survivor of the attack on Ut√∏ya, he appears in court as a witness and delivers an account of the massacre. Breivik is sentenced to 21 years, that can be extended by a court if it is deemed he is still a danger to society. ==Cast== *Anders Danielsen Lie as Anders Behring Breivik *Jon √òigarden as Geir Lippestad *Thorbj√∏rn Harr as Sveinn Are Hanssen *Jonas Strand Gravli as Viljar Hanssen *Ola G.

Huber served as the 79th president of the American Sociological Association in 1989. Huber taught at the University of Notre Dame from 1967 to 1971, eventually moving to Illinois, where she taught at the University of Illinois at Urbana/Champaign. While instructing numerous sociology courses at the University of Illinois at Urbana/Champaign, Huber served as the director of Women's Studies Program for two years (1978‚Äì1980), and then became the head of the Department of Sociology in 1979 until 1983. In 1984, Huber left Illinois for an opportunity at the Ohio State University, where she became the dean of the College of Social and Behavioral Sciences, coordinating dean of the Colleges of the Arts and Sciences, and senior vice president for academic affairs and university provost. During her time, Huber was president of Sociologists for Women in Society from 1972‚Äì1974, the Midwest Sociological Society from 1979‚Äì1980, and the American Sociological Association from 1988‚Äì1989. Being highly recognized for her excellence, in 1985 Huber was given the Jessie Bernard Award by the American Sociological Association. Not only was Huber an instructor of sociology at multiple institutions or president of different organization, she also served different editorial review boards, research committees, and counseled and directed many institutions on their sociology departments. == Life == === Early life === Huber was born on October 17, 1925 in Bluffton, Ohio, to her mother, Hallie Althaus, and her father, Lawrence Huber, an entomologist. As a child, Huber lived in Wooster, Ohio, where her father worked at the Agricultural Experiment Station. Her scholarly influences were her father's education (Ph.D.) and The College of Wooster, a liberal arts college, located in the town. Huber graduated from Wooster High School in 1941. Hometown === Family === Daughter of Hallie Althaus and Lawrence Huber, Joan's father was an entomologist and studied insects in Wooster, Ohio. Lawrence Huber worked at the Agricultural Experiment Station, which is now known as the College of Food, Agricultural, and Environmental Sciences (CFAFES). Joan's father also received his doctorate degree. Huber first married around 1945 to Tony Rytina, after she graduated from Penn State. In her first marriage she had two children, Nancy and Steve. Huber met her second husband in 1971 and both accepted jobs at the University of Illinois. === Education === In 1945, Huber graduated from the Pennsylvania State University, where she earned and completed her bachelor's degree in German in less than two years. Following her graduation at the Pennsylvania State University, Huber then attended Western Michigan University, pursuing a master's degree. Ultimately receiving a master's in sociology in 1963, Huber then went on and furthered her education at Michigan State University and in 1967 she graduated and received her Ph.D. === Career === Huber's work focused around gender stratification, which looks at the uneven dispersal of wealth, power, and privilege between the sexes and the absence of women in the political sphere. Huber first taught at the University of Notre Dame from 1967 to 1971, eventually moving to the University of Illinois at Urbana/Champaign. While there, Huber served as the director of the Women's Studies Program for two years (1978‚Äì1980), becoming the head of the Department of Sociology in 1979 until 1983. In 1984, Huber moved to Ohio State University, where she became the dean of the College of Social and Behavioral Sciences, coordinating dean of the colleges of the Arts and Sciences, and senior vice president for academic affairs and university provost. Huber was president of Sociologists for Women in Society from 1972 to 1974, the Midwest Sociological Society from 1979 to 1980, and the American Sociological Association from 1988 to 1989. In 1985 Huber was given the Jessie Bernard Award by the American Sociological Association. Huber retired in 1993 after 48 years of research and education. In 2007 Huber wrote On the Origins of Gender Inequality. In her book, Huber discusses asymmetrical gender inequality and how it has perpetuated men's domination of human societies and women's subordination. Finding that important biodata from studies of sex and gender stratification has been excluded from sociology, Huber argues that it is critical to acknowledge biological sex differences to comprehend the small role that women have played in activities of more power and prestige. == Educational positions == * Pennsylvania State University (1945‚Äì1947), German department instructor * University of Notre Dame (1967‚Äì1971), sociology * University of Illinois at Urbana/Champaign (1979‚Äì1983), intro sociology, sociology of poverty, social stratification, introduction to women's studies program * Ohio State University (1984‚Äì1992), dean of the College of Social and Behavioral Sciences * Ohio State University (1986‚Äì1992), coordinating dean of the colleges of the arts and sciences * Ohio State University (1992‚Äì1993), senior vice president for academic affairs and university provost == Selected publications == * Joan Huber, On the Origins of Gender Inequality.

From St. Louis, Missouri, Palazzolo moved to Chicago, Illinois in 1960 to attend the School of the Art Institute of Chicago. Palazzolo is most known for his Chicago-centric documentary films. He is recognized for his ability to reveal the realities of the working class and urban life. Utilizing the Cin√©ma v√©rit√© style in films such as Jerry's (1976), his perspective often include panoramic views of a place or event. Palazzolo's editing style is said to add a sense of humor while still portraying his subjects honestly. He was an important part of the underground film scene in Chicago during the 1960-70s that set itself apart from the lights of Hollywood and New York City. == Early life== Tom Palazzolo was born in a working-class neighborhood in north Saint Louis, Missouri. His father was the son of Italian immigrants and his mother was third-generation Irish. Palazzolo is the oldest of his three siblings, Lynn, Bob and Janis. He attended an all-boys Catholic elementary school where he was recognized for his drawing abilities of his favourite characters. Evading his parents wish for him to attend an all-boys Catholic high school as well, Palazzolo managed to slip into the public Beaumont High School. His interest in drawing led to his submission in a Draw Me! contest and his enrollment in a mail-in Art Instruction Schools. == Education == After graduating high school in 1957, Palazzolo worked at McDonnell Douglas plant for a year. During that time, he saved up money to attend art school. Off the recommendation of an old teacher, he enrolled in the Ringling College of Art and Design in Sarasota, Florida. While at Ringling, he met Bernie Beckman, and the two studied commercial art together. Beckmann soon left for The School of the Art Institute of Chicago and Palazzolo wanted to follow. He was rejected the first time but came back in person the next year and was accepted. After moving in with Beckmann, he began to explore the city. He was intrigued by the grit of Chicago, its buildings, neighborhoods, businesses, attractions, and people. These interests would become a part of his painting practice to the disdain of his professors. After a slew of negative painting critiques, he signed up for a photography class taught by Kenneth Josephson in 1963. Josephson was the first professor to positively critique Palazzolo. Josephson also gave him his first filmmaking camera, the Keystone 16mm. Palazzolo's six years as a student wrapped up at his final critique where he presented his photography instead of paintings. So, his painting professors decided to give him a Bachelor and Master of Fine Arts in Photography. Palazzolo is known for exhibiting with the group known as the Hairy Who or Chicago Imagists, a group of students from the School of the Art Institute of Chicago for transformed the city's art scene in the 60s with their bold, eclectic work and displays after graduation. == Professional life == Underground film groups and independent filmmakers were coming onto the scene most notably in New York City, Los Angeles, and Chicago. Palazzolo was particularly inspired by artists D.A. Pennabaker and Ricky Leacock for shooting without a tripod as well as experimenting with the ideas of narrative. These were unconventional techniques of cinema verit√© moving away from the static and scripted west coast films. Palazzolo was among the group of artists in Chicago who helped pioneer the art of independent filmmaking. In the mid 1960s, Palazzolo and a group of friends formed the Floating Cinematheque, a secret film society that met in apartments around Chicago. Many of the films by the Floating Cinematheque faced the chagrin of the Chicago Police Censor Board, which determined whether films should be censored or not. Once the Motion Picture Association of America adopted a rating system of films in 1968, local censorship watchdogs became a thing of the past and dispersed the attention for underground film groups like Floating Cinematheque. During his time with the Floating Cinematheque, Palazzolo also regularly attended Monday night screenings at the Second City that were curated by exhibitors under the name Aardvark. Screenings at film festivals and Aardvark helped the promotion of Palazzolo's films. Roger Ebert was in attendance to many of the showings. He even reviewed some of Palazzolo's films such as Pigeon Lady about a neighborhood woman who fed the birds and Campaign, a film about the Democratic Convention of 1968. During the 1960s, Ebert was a well known supporter of Palazzolo's independent style and the two interviewed together with author and broadcaster Studs Terkel's WTTW talk show. Tom Palazzolo's paintings from the Pamphlet Files at the Flaxman Library at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago. In 1968, after gaining notable media attention for his documentary films, Palazzolo was invited by the United States Information Agency to tour the Middle East, Ceylon, India, and Turkey for three months to give talks and screen his films publicly. They chose Palazzolo, a so-called non-flamboyant Midwesterner but still from the notable city of Chicago to help inspire and promote independent filmmaking in those countries. Palazzolo also married long-term girlfriend Marcia Daehn in the same year in order for her to join him on the trip. Palazzolo has taught film classes at Richard J. Daley College of the Chicago City Colleges from 1966-2002 and The School of the Art Institute of Chicago from 1976-1990.\\"Bulletin of the Art Institute of Chicago (1973-1982), vol. 75, no. 3, 1981, pp. 21‚Äì21\\". JSTOR. School of the Art Institute of Chicago. Collection of Tom Palazzolo's films at the Chicago Film Archives. Palazzolo may be most well known for his film work, but he has continued his painting practice in shows such as \\"Tom Marches On! Four Decades of Paintings, Prints, and Photographs by Tom Palazzolo,\\" in October 1999. \\"I always tried to knock out at least a few paintings a year, just to, um, keep my foot in, \\" said Palazzolo Palazzolo also continues his photography practice. In July 2013, Palazzolo had a show called \\"The Tom Palazzolo Retrospective: Film, Photographs, Paintings, Watercolors & Sculpture\\" at the Co-Prosperity Sphere in Chicago's Bridgeport neighborhood. Palazzolo's book \\"Clark Street\\" was published in November 2019 with many of his original photos of Chicago from the 1960s and 1970s. The Chicago Film Archives houses a large collection of Palazzolo's original films and subsequent copies. == Major works and collaborators == Early notable films of Palazzolo's include Love It / Leave It (1973), a document of the Naked City Beauty Pageant in Roselawn, Indiana and a variety of midwestern parades. This film includes a political statement by juxtaposing scenes of nude pageant contestants with shots of police officers and quick cuts of clowns, illustrating Palazzolo's interest in political and social commentary. Often a participant or a close observer to the action, Palazzolo works to reveal absurdities he finds in midwestern norms and values. Palazzolo approaches the subject of parades again in Your Astronauts (1970), in which he uses noise from a cafeteria as a soundtrack for the chaos of the Apollo 11 parade. Palazzolo found particular interest in the large number of suburban residents who had made their way into the city for occasions like these. In 1972, Palazzolo met sixteen-year-old Jeff Kreines, a high school dropout from New Trier High School. He viewed one of Kreines' documentary films while judging a contest for student filmmakers at the Chicago Public Library. He admired Kreine's Cin√©ma v√©rit√© style, and the two made eight films together, with the most notable being Pets on Parade and Ricky and Rocky. Ricky and Rocky follows Ricky, who is Italian, and Roxanne, who is Polish, through their surprise wedding shower thrown by Ricky's family. The camerawork in Ricky and Rocky emphasizes the family and their style, which is consequently more eventful than the wedding shower itself. The film won awards at the Ann Arbor Film Festival and the Bellevue Film Festival. Kreines later introduced Palazzolo to Mark Rance, a classmate of his from New Trier. Palazzolo and Rance soon became collaborators as well. Their first collaboration was in 1975 about a naturist community in northern Indiana, titled Sneakin 'n Peakin'. Rance and Palazzolo's most well-known documentaries were Marquette Park and Marquette Park II, which documented still-existing bands of Nazis protesting black families moving into Marquette Park in the mid-1970s. These films were shown at the Museum of Contemporary Art Chicago and later at the Cannes Film Festival. Palazzolo and Rance's collaborations came to and end when Rance moved to Los Angeles. During this time Palazzo worked on independent projects including Jerry's, an inside look at the hectic nature of Jerry's Deli in Streeterville, Gay for a Day, which chronicled a pride parade, and I Was a Contestant at Mother's Wet T-shirt Contest, filmed at Mother's Bar and Club. Other collaborators included Allen Ross, who helped found Chicago Filmmakers. In 1980, Ross and Palazzolo created Nonna, a portrait of Palazzolo's Italian grandmother. By this time, the independent film industry was changing rapidly due to a rise in costs and the introduction of video. While many filmmakers switched to video, Palazzolo went on to create two more film works - this time narratives, titled Caligari's Cure (1982) and Added Lessons (1991). == Personal life == Palazzolo married his wife Marcia Daehn in 1968. They had three children: Sarah, Amy, and Todd. Amy was featured in one of Palazzolo's short films in 2001 known as Rita on the Ropes which Jack Helbig helped write. == References == == External links == * * Tom Palazzolo at the Video Data Bank * Tom Palazzolo at the Independent Video Archive * Tom Palazzolo Collection at Chicago Film Archives Category:American experimental filmmakers Category:American photographers Category:1937 births Category:Living people ","title":"Tom Palazzolo"},{"id":"56587096","text":"Franz Kleinberger was a European art dealer.

Herbert was born after 1678, the only son of Henry Herbert, 1st Baron Herbert of Chirbury and his wife Anne Ramsey, daughter of John Ramsey, Dyer, of London. He was educated at Westminster School in 1695 and then privately under Abel Boyer in 1699. Herbert stood for Parliament at Bewdley at the 1705 English general election but was defeated in the poll and was then unsuccessful with a petition. His father, a staunch Whig, then procured a new charter for Bewdley and was able to take control of the borough. Herbert junior was returned as a Whig Member of Parliament for Bewdley at the 1708 British general election. His father died on 22 January 1709 and Herbert succeeded to the peerage. Consequently he vacated his seat in the House of Commons to sit in the House of Lords. There he continued to challenge a petition against his election in order to secure the new charter. Lord Herbert married Mary Wallop, daughter of John Wallop of Farley Wallop, Hampshire, on 12 December 1709. She was the sister of John Wallop, 1st Earl of Portsmouth. Herbert's election expenses had helped bring him into financial difficulties. By 1713 he was serving the Tory ministry of Robert Harley, Earl of Oxford, who personally funded Herbert so he could stay in London and vote. When the Whigs were in control after 1714, Herbert reverted to his original allegiance in the hope of securing financial aid. He died without issue on 19 April 1738, allegedly by suicide.

Fuchs Epstein served as president of the American Sociological Association in 2006. == Professional == At Columbia University, Fuchs Epstein was able to study the changing American family after receiving a grant of $1,000 from the Institute of Life Insurance. Her study showed that women were beginning to enter the workforce at higher rates than they previously had, but there still weren't many jobs considered appropriate for women. This locked women out of prestigious professions and prevented upward mobility. Fuchs Epstein's dissertation analyzed the various factors that affected whether or not women were excluded or included in the professional realm, focusing on female lawyers as a deviant case because they were rare. She decided to study a sample of women lawyers who found a way around the prevalent gender discrimination. In 1966, she joined a number of other women who were in academics or other professional positions to form the National Organization for Women in New York City. She also actively participated in professional women's groups such as Sociologists for Women in Society (SWS) and the Professional Women's Caucus. Fuchs Epstein participated in various hearings on gender discrimination as a scholar and activist, testifying at the Equal Employment Opportunities Commission (EEOC) where she spoke about Title VII of the Civil Rights Act and the barriers women faced in the professional world at the time. Fuchs Epstein was a consultant to the White House under two administrations, one of which being President Ford's, to the American Telephone and Telegraph Company, and General Motors. She also served at the National Academy of Sciences on the Committee of Women's Employment. She conducted research that focused on the segregation based on gender and race at AT&T.; Furthermore, she served as an expert witness on the Citadel case where she argued women in this military school should be included. Fuchs Epstein's first book was published in 1971 and was titled Women's Place: Option and Limits on Professional Careers. In it she focused on women's professional advancement as framed by the ‚Äúopportunities offered them, the organizational limits placed on their ambitions, and the recognition and reward of their accomplishments.‚Äù Specifically, she incorporated gender into a discussion of social structures and status. Her work \\"made a crucial connection between traditional sociology and the emerging field of women's studies.\\" Her second book was published in 1981 and was titled Women in Law. In this work she provided empirical evidence that illuminated how these processes affected the careers of female lawyers. In 1981 Fuchs Epstein received the Merit Award of the American Bar Association for Women in Law as well as the SCRIBE's Book Award. For her first study after completing her graduate education, she studied specifically Black female professionals whom she interviewed about the various factors that made it possible for them to achieve their positions despite the discrimination they faced for their gender and skin color. Out of this study came an article titled \\"Positive Effects of the Multiple Negative: Explaining the Success of Black Professional Women\\", which the American Journal of Sociology published in 1973 and explained that employers were willing to hire African-American women because they could look good for hiring them but not have to hire both a woman and an African-American person. Fuchs Epstein uncovered that the thought behind hiring these women was essentially killing two birds with one stone to as artificially as possible satisfy the demand for opportunities for women and African-Americans. Fuchs Epstein's interest in women's professional lives led her to ‚Äúexplore the dynamics of stereotyping in all spheres of society,‚Äù focusing on how boundaries are socially constructed. Out of this came the book Deceptive Distinctions, which was published in 1988. In the 1990s, the Association of the Bar of the City of New York's Committee on the Status of Women invited Fuchs Epstein to research why women's professional careers often ended mid-stream. She conducted a study of the professional mobility of women in several corporate law firms. From this research emerged the concept of the ‚Äúglass ceiling,‚Äù which is essentially women never attaining the highest status in their careers. In 1993 Women in Law was reissued with a new section discussing the glass ceiling effect in the legal profession. Fuchs Epstein was invited to meet with Hirsh Cohen, vice- president of the Alfred Sloan Foundation, in 1994. She conducted research that discovered that a very small percentage of lawyers (less than three percent) chose to work part-time because this caused others to perceive them as less committed to their professional life and ultimately resulted in them not being given very meaningful work. This research informed her next book, titled The Part-time Paradox: Time Norms, Professional Life, Family and Gender, published in 1999. She produced a paper titled \\"Border Crossings: The Constraints of Time Norms in Transgressions of Gender and Professional Roles,\\" published in 2004, that examines how doing something professionally, which goes against the expectations for women, is prevented by time norms which create priorities in certain categories for people. It looks at the ways in which ideologies of time, such as the idea that professions are greedy institutions, as well as gender ideologies, like the concept that women should take care of the family, restrict social change. Fuchs Epstein is Emeritus Distinguished Professor of Sociology at the City University of New York Graduate Center and has been since 1990. She is a past president of the American Sociological Association. She has been a visiting professor or scholar at the Russel Sage Foundation, the Stanford Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences, and the Stanford and Columbia Law Schools, among many other places. She was chair of the ASA Occupations and Organizations, Culture, and Sex and Gender Sections and president of the Eastern Sociological Society. She was also a Guggenheim Fellow.

He is known for his early socially-conscious documentary films that touch on topics such as opposition to United States involvement in the Vietnam War, gentrification of Chicago, racism, and social class. He produced many of these with the film collective Kartemquin Films, of which he was an original member. He is best known for his work on the film The End of the Nightstick (1993) with Cindi Moran and Eric Scholl, which documented police brutality in Chicago and torture allegations against commander Jon Burge. Kuttner has worked extensively in activism and community service, and was a founding member of activist group Rising Up Angry. Kuttner has worked with many collaborators including Kartemquin Collective founder Gordon Quinn, and filmmakers Haskell Wexler and Robert Kramer. He is also known for camera work on a number of major motion pictures including Man of Steel and Source Code. == Early career == Kuttner grew up in a middle-class neighborhood and attended public school near Wrigley Field in Chicago, Illinois. He attended college at Northwestern University, where he created the film Cause Without a Rebel (1965), a short documentary film about student political complacency on the Northwestern Campus. Kuttner graduated from Northwestern that same year in 1965. After graduation, Kuttner joined the War On Poverty Pre-College Film Workshop program. During this time he taught and collaborated with African-American students from Dillard University in New Orleans on the films Tackle is a Girl‚Äôs Best Friend (1965) and Mary Had a Little Lamb (1965). In 1966 Kuttner was hired as a director at Chicago Television Station WTTW (Window to the World), a station that would eventually be owned by PBS. It was here that a visiting crew introduced Kuttner to the Cin√©ma v√©rit√© style of documentary filmmaking. There he made a small number of shows including the arts series \\"Facets\\". === Newsreel === After leaving WTTW in the fall of 1967, Kuttner became interested in political activism and eventually reconnected with some Canadian Cin√©ma v√©rit√© filmmakers he had worked with before, who were filming a piece about Norman Mailer out of the Toronto offices of Allan King. During his stay in New York, Kuttner met Melvin Margolis at a film screening, who then introduced him to Newsreel, a New York-based documentary film group whose subjects included the Anti-war movement, the Black Power movement, and the Women's liberation movement. The group had connections to anti-war protestors David Dellinger, Rennie Davis, and Tom Hayden, who would eventually be named as part of the Chicago Seven conspiracy. Kuttner opened a Chicago chapter of the group, recruiting 15 members, including Jon Jost, and established ties with local film collectives like Kartemquin and The Film Group. The Chicago branch functioned mostly as a distributor for the New York Headquarters. The branch released one film under the name ‚ÄúChicago Film Co-op‚Äù, April 27 (1986), which documented the 1968 Democratic National Convention protests and police response. They also started production on two other films that were later damaged in a fire. One of the films, a documentary about the Black Panther Party's Illinois chapter's involvement in the Free Breakfast for Children program, was lost completely. The other was the film Trick Bag, which Kuttner would eventually restore during his time at Kartemquin. === Activism and community service === Kuttner was a founding member of the Chicago New Left activist group Rise Up Angry, where he took a break from filmmaking. There, he wrote film reviews for the organization‚Äôs newspaper and helped organize their citywide free clinic. They worked alongside the Peace movement, Black Power movement, and Women's liberation movement. Kuttner also spent time working with Upward Bound, a college prep program for students from disadvantaged areas. He also worked on the boards of the Community TV Network and Community Film Workshop, both established media programs for Chicago youth. === Kartemquin === Kuttner started working with Kartemquin in 1968, and joined officially in 1972 after he got a call from Gordon Quinn. At Kartemquin, his films covered topics ranging from gentrification to funding cuts of home-birth organizations. During his time there he worked on the films Hum 255, Trick Bag, and Now We Live on Clifton, and the Chicago Maternity Center Story (1976). === Trick Bag === Trick Bag was a collaboration between Kartemquin, Columbia College Chicago, and Rise Up Angry. Peter Kuttner's connection to Rise Up Angry sparked the creation of the film, as it was originally a Newsreel project that had been left unfinished when the group dissolved. The film negatives were destroyed in a fire, but Kuttner helped restore it from the work print when he joined Kartemquin in 1972. The film features various conversations and interviews with youth, workers, and veterans around Chicago talking about race and class. Trick Bag went on to earn the Chicago International Film Festival \\"Merit Award\\". === The End of the Nightstick === In 1994 Kuttner collaborated with Chicago Torture Justice, an organization dealing with the aftermath and recovery of brutality experienced at the hands of police officers like Jon Burge. Kuttner produced The End of the Nightstick (1994), a PBS P.O.V. broadcast, with Cyndi Moran and Eric Scholl. The film received a Silver Hugo from the Chicago International Film Festival in 1994. == Later career == In 2017 Kuttner worked as an instructor to Community TV Network students, who created a film featuring the south side of Chicago community center. The short film, Welcome to the Peace House, went on to win the CHICAGO Award by the Chicago International Film Festival‚Äôs CineYouth Festival. Kuttner has continued his work as a political activist through local activist groups and as a member of the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees Union, and as a board member of South Side Projections. == Commercial filmmaking == Kuttner has contributed to a number of commercial productions in Chicago as a camera assistant. Some of these include Ferris Bueller's Day Off (1986), The Dark Knight (2008), Source Code (2011), Transformers: Dark of the Moon (2011), Formosa Betrayed (2009), and the U.S. version of TV series Shameless. Others that were filmed in and around Chicago were Man of Steel (2013), Cheaper by the Dozen (2003), Proof (2005), The Break-Up (2006), Eagle Eye (2008), Traitor (2008), Barbershop 2: Back in Business (2004), and Mad Dog and Glory (1993). ==References== == External links == * Category:American filmmakers Category:American human rights activists Category:Artists from Chicago Category:Living people Category:Northwestern University alumni Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Peter Kuttner"},{"id":"56587170","text":"Chulmleigh (1934 - after 1957) was a British Thoroughbred racehorse and sire. He showed little ability in his early career and finished no better than third in his first four races before winning a minor race at Chepstow Racecourse in the summer of his three-year-old season. After a promising second at York in August he recorded a major upset by winning the St Leger Stakes. He was retired soon afterwards and stood as a breeding stallion in Britain and Argentina. He had little success as a sire of winners. ==Background== Chulmleigh was a \\"massive\\" bay horse standing 16.3 hands high bred in England by William Tatem, 1st Baron Glanely who also owned him during his racing career. The horse had an unusual facial marking in the form of an abbreviated white blaze which began half-way down his face and ran down to his nose. He was sent into training with Lord Glanely's private trainer Thomas Hogg at Newmarket, Suffolk. Both of Chulmleigh's parents were Classic winners who had been owned by Lord Glanely and trained by Hogg. He was from the first crop of foals sired by Singapore, who won the St Leger in 1930, while his dam, Rose of England took the Oaks Stakes in the same year. Singapore was not a great success as a breeding stallion and was eventually exported to Brazil. Rose of England produced several other good horses including the July Stakes winner British Empire. ==Racing career== ===1936: two-year-old season=== Chulmleigh ran three times as two-year-old in 1936, producing his only placed effort on his debut when running third in the Whitsuntide Plate at Manchester Racecourse in June. Later that month he was sent to Royal Ascot for the Chesham Stakes but came home unplaced behind Lord Derby's colt Fair Copy, who won the Middle Park Stakes later that year. He returned after a break for the Imperial Produce Stakes at Kempton Park Racecourse in autumn but finished unplaced. ===1937: three-year-old season=== Chulmleigh did not compete as a three-year- old until July and then made no impact in a seven furlong maiden race at Newmarket Racecourse as he finished unplaced at odds of 20/1. The colt eventually won a race at the fifth attempt whe he defeated moderate opposition to take the Summer Stakes at Chepstow. At York Racecourse in August, Chulmleigh showed high-class form for the first time as he produced a strong late run and finished a close second to the gelding Mange Tout in the Great Yorkshire Stakes. On 8 September Chulmleigh was moved into the highest class to contest the 162nd running of the St Leger Stakes over fourteen and a half furlongs at Doncaster Racecourse. Before the race he was described as having \\"nothing to his credit\\" as a contender. Ridden by Gordon Richards, who only took the ride when his intended mount was withdrawn, he started an 18/1 outsider in a fifteen-runner field headed by the Epsom Derby winner Mid-day Sun. After taking an early lead, he settled behind the leaders as Maranta set the pace from a closely bunched field. Many horse were still in close contention a furlong out at which point Fair Copy went to the front and looked the likely winner. Chulmleigh, however, produced a strong late run to overtake Fair Copy inside the last 50 yards and won by half a length in what was described as a \\"sensational finish\\". Mid-Day Sun, who had been repeatedly hampered, was three-quarters of a length away in third. Chulmleigh was expected to reappear in the Jockey Club Stakes but never ran again and was retired to stud at the end of the 1938 season. ==Assessment and honours== In their book, A Century of Champions, based on the Timeform rating system, John Randall and Tony Morris rated Chulmleigh a \\"poor\\" winner of the St Leger. ==Stud record== Chulmleigh stood as a stallion in England but attracted little interest from breeders. The best of his offspring was probably Whiteway, who won the Yorkshire Cup and the Cesarewitch. He also sired the mare Sweet and Rough who produced the Goodwood Cup winner Tenterhooks. In 1945 he was sold and exported to Argentina where his last reported foals were born in 1958. ==Pedigree== *Chulmleigh was inbred 4 √ó 4 to Bay Ronald, meaning that this stallion appears twice in the fourth generation of his pedigree. ==References== Category:1934 racehorse births Category:Racehorses bred in the United Kingdom Category:Racehorses trained in the United Kingdom Category:Thoroughbred family 3-i Category:St Leger winners ","title":"Chulmleigh (horse)"},{"id":"56587184","text":"is a Japanese Olympian speed skater. == Education == Go is studying commerce at the Yamanashi Gakuin University in Kofu, Japan. == Career == Go won a bronze medal in the 500m at the 2017 Asian Winter Games.

He produced devotional pictures in a style reminiscent of contemporary painters working in Bruges such as Gerard David and Ambrosius Benson.D. Martens, 'Le Ma√Ætre aux Madones Joufflues: Essai de monographie sur un anonyme brugeois du XVIme si√®cle,' Wallraf-Richartz- Jahrbuch LXI, 2000, pp. 112-115, 141, n. 23, figs. 1, 6, 15 ==Identification the oeuvre== Virgin and Child with Saint Joseph and an Angel In an article published in 2000, the Belgian art historian Didier Martens grouped eight paintings together under the notname Master of the Plump-Cheeked Madonnas. The key work around which he built the identification was the Virgin and Child with Saints Dominic, Augustine, Margaret and Barbara (at that time in the collection of the Metropolitan Museum and since auctioned by Christie's on 29 January 2014, New York, lot 105). On stylistic grounds Didier Martens attributed the works to an anonymous painter believed to have been active in Bruges during the first half of the 16th century. All of the works contain female figures which are characterised by their rounded, full faces. It is this key feature that gave rise to the naming of the artist as the 'Master of the Plump-Cheeked Madonnas'. In particular, the faces of the female figures in these works show a strong resemblance to each other: the forehead is high and clear, the eyes are half-closed, the eyelids are fat, the eyebrows are fine and curved, the nose ends on a straight edge and the nostrils are narrow.D. Martens, 'Une oeuvre m√©connue du Ma√Ætre aux madones joufflues', Cahiers du Mus√©e des beaux-Arts de Lyons (2002-2006), kol. 28-35 Stylistically the paintings are close to the mature work of other Bruges painters such as Gerard David and Ambrosius Benson. Whereas the artist was likely active in Bruges as is evidenced by the clear influence of the Bruges style on his work it does not necessarily mean that he was a native of Bruges. ==Works== About a dozen works are now attributed to the Master.D. Martens, 'Deux nouvelles attributions au Ma√Ætre des madones joufflues', Oud Holland 115 (2001-2002), p. 157-166 The subject matter of the works attributed to the Master are devotional in nature and most of them depict scenes with the Virgin and Child, the Holy family and the so-called sacra conversazione, i.e. the Virgin and Child amidst a group of saints in a relatively informal grouping. A few portraits by his hand have also been preserved. These works likely portrayed the donors who had paid for the devotional work of which the portraits had formed the pendants. ==Selected works== Madonna and Child with a Member of the Hillensberger Family The works attributed to the Master of the Plump-Cheeked Madonnas include: *Virgin and Child with Saints Dominic, Augustine, Margaret and Barbara, formerly in the collection of the Metropolitan Museum and since auctioned by Christie's on 29 January 2014, New York, lot 105 * Virgin and Child with Saint Joseph and an Angel, Mus√©e de l'h√¥tel Sandelin * Virgin and Child, Groeningemuseum * Virgin giving milk, Museum of Fine Arts of Lyon * Madonna and Child with a Member of the Hillensberger Family, Lowe Art Museum *Virgin and Child, Museo Nacional de San Carlos *Virgin and Child, formerly in the collection of the marqu√©s de Santo Domingo ==Notes== == External links == * Category:Flemish Renaissance painters Category:Flemish history painters Category:Flemish portrait painters Category:People from Bruges Category:Members of the Antwerp Guild of Saint Luke ","title":"Master of the Plump-Cheeked Madonnas"},{"id":"56587226","text":"Johann Jakob Fugger by Christoph Amberger, 1541. Johann Jakob Fugger or Hans Jakob Fugger (23 December 1516, Augsburg - 14 July 1575, Munich) was a German banker and patron of the arts and sciences from the von der Lilie (of the Lily) line of the noted Fugger banking family. ==Life== Memorial to Johann Jakob Fugger in Augsburg, put up by Louis I of Bavaria. He was the son of Raymund Fugger (1489‚Äì1535) and his wife Katharina (1488‚Äì1535), daughter of J√°nos Thurz√≥, owner of a mining company. Johann Jakob inherited the business from his father's brother Anton Fugger in 1560 but did not prove so fortunate in his business dealings - the family had lent money to Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor, landing them in deep trouble when Spain went bankrupt. Johann Jakob had to sell off his whole collection (except his library) to improve matters and handed the business over to his cousin Marcus (1529‚Äì1597), who was able to consolidate it. In 1565 he entered Albert V's service and later became president of his privy chamber. On Titian's advice, Johann Jakob brought Titian's pupil Antonio Ponzano to Augsburg to paint frescoes in the inner courtyard of the Fuggerh√§user - frescoes had already been painted on the building's inner courtyard and outer wall by Hans Burckmair the Younger (1500‚Äì1562) and Albrecht Altdorfer. Jacopo Strada also acted as Johann Jakob's art agent in Italy. He was in correspondence with cardinal de Grandvelle - one of his letters to him was included in Pelisson's Trait√© de la Tol√©rance des religions (Treatise on Tolerance of religions). He also had a major library and tried to convince Hieronymus Wolf to become its librarian. In 1571 he sold it to Albert V, making it the nucleus of the Bayerische Staatsbibliothek. Johann Jakob is also thought to be the author of the two folio-volume Wahrhaftigen Beschreibung des √∂sterreichischen und habsburgischen Rahmens, Herkommens, Geschlechte, Fortpflanzung (True Description of the Austrian and Habsburg Houses...), written in German, with over 30,000 coats of arms, seals, portraits and other images. Copies of it survive in libraries in Vienna and Dresden, Lamb√©cius and Rollar published fragments from it and Sigismond de Birken published an extract under the title Spiegel der Ehren des h√∂chstl√∂blichen Kayser- und K√∂niglichen Ertzhauses Oesterreich (Mirror of the Lords of the most high Imperial and Kingly House of Austria).

Antonio Ponzano, Ponzoni or Bonzone (died 1602, Munich) was an Italian Mannerist painter active in the 16th century. His birthplace is unknown - it may have been Venice, since he was influenced by the Venetian style. He was a studio assistant to Giulio Licinio in 1565 at the court of Maximilian II, Holy Roman Emperor in Vienna. Between 1550 and 1600 a large number of Italian painters moved to the Wittelsbach ducal court. Major banking families such as the Fuggers were also major art patrons - Ponzano himself was an assistant to Friedrich Sustris between 1569 and 1573 in Augsburg, where Sustris was working for Hans Fugger. Between 1585 and 1597 Ponzano was at the court in Munich. Some of Ponzano's 1570-1572 paintings with 'grottesche' survive in the Fugger palace in Augsburg, as well as some of his studio work for Sustris. He also assisted Sustris and Alessandro Scalzi (known as Il Paduano) on their 1580 work at Trausnitz Castle at Landshut - there Ponzano worked on the lodges in the castle, creating scenes of mythological love affairs.

Under the NCAA rules of the era, junior college transfers that had previously attended a four-year college were not allowed to play in tournaments during their first season at the new (third) At the Far West Classic in Portland in late December, Idaho lost two of three games without him. With Johnson on the floor, the team was entering the final weekend, but dropped two in Seattle. Led by leading scorer Chuck White and Johnson, the Vandals were at their best in their main rivalries from the old Pacific Coast Conference: versus Oregon, versus Palouse neighbor Washington State, and against Washington. The primary nemesis was Seattle University, led by guard Eddie Miles, who swept all three games, half of UI's losses. Idaho dropped its only game with Oregon State at the Far West without Johnson, but won all three with Gonzaga, for a record against its four former PCC foes and a collective against the six Northwest rivals.

Despite their record, the Vandals were not invited to the post-season. The NCAA tournament included only 25 teams and Oregon State and Seattle U. were selected from the Northwest. The NIT invited just twelve teams, with none from the Mountain or Pacific time zones. If Idaho had been invited, Johnson was ineligible to participate. ==Aftermath== That spring, 24-year-old Johnson was the tenth overall selection in the 1963 NBA draft and went on to a hall of fame career with the Baltimore Bullets. Cipriano also moved on to coach at Nebraska for seventeen until his death. Without Johnson (and White), the Vandals fell to in and were in the new Big Sky Conference, fifth place in the six-team league.

The former village at L'Abbaye 2 is about from the lake shore and consisted of a number of stilt houses. It has been dendrochronologically dated to 1040-986 BC. The village site covers an area of about and was probably connected to the shore by a foot bridge. About 400 Bronze Age objects have been discovered in the water around the village.Palafittes.org nominating documents-Volume II: Id-files of the component parts of the serial, section 2 accessed 18 October 2011 The Les Argilliez site consists of two villages. One is a Classical Cortaillod village with 6 piles dated between 3841 and 3817 BC. The other is a Late Cortaillod site with 2 piles from 3531 to 3528 BC. Both villages are in a small bay about north of the Chez-le-Bart 1 site. The remains of the villages are still quite visible underwater and stretch over an area of about . Some stone axes, antler ax handles and pottery fragments have been discovered. Port-Conty has two neolithic settlements. The first is a Late Cortaillod or Port-Conty type Cortaillod village. One piece of timber from this site has been dated to 3574. The second village is a Late Horgen village. Five of the piles are from 3160 and 3159, and two piles are from 3064 and 3062. The site was discovered in 1860 by F. Troyon, who originally thought it was a Bronze Age village. Further excavations in the late 19th and early 20th century found that it was a neolithic site. In 1929-1932, P. Vouga dug a long () deep trench to examine a single layer. He found three archaeological horizons which were from the Middle Neolithic, the Late Neolithic and the end of the Late Neolithic. Based on his study, it appears that the site was covered by an artificial mound which was and about deep. It was built in two stages, with a layer of branches between the layers.

The spacecraft was designed to launch a crew from the Earth to conduct a flyby of the Moon and return to Earth. The primary focus was a Soviet circumlunar flight, which help document the Moon, and also show Soviet power. The test ran from the Zond program from 1967-1970, which produced multiple failures in the 7K-L1's re-entry systems. The remaining 7K-L1s were scrapped, ultimately replaced by the Soyuz 7K-L3. ==Objectives== Kosmos 146 was a Soviet test precursor to the Zond series, launched from the Baikonur cosmodrome aboard a Proton K rocket. It was launched into a planned highly elliptical Earth orbit. The Blok D stage functioned correctly in putting the spacecraft into a translunar trajectory. It was not aimed at the Moon and no recovery of the spacecraft was planned or attempted. It was a successful mission that created false confidence just before a string of failures that would follow. Kosmos 146 was launched using a Proton-K carrier rocket, which flew from Site 81/23 at Baikonur. The launch occurred at 11:30:33 GMT on 10 March 1967 and was successful. Kosmos 146 was operated in an Earth orbit, it had a perigee of , an apogee of , an inclination of 51.5¬∞ and an orbital period of 89.2 minutes. Kosmos 146 decayed from orbit on 18 March 1967. ==Moon race== By the time the spacecraft was launched, the United States had already thrust into the orbit in their prototype of the lunar vehicle (AS-201, AS-202, AS-203). The United States could go on to launch manned prototypes of lunar ships before the USSR brought the first unmanned prototype into orbit, but two months before the launch of Kosmos-146, during the fire in the command module, the crew of Apollo 1 was killed. ==References== ==External links== * http://militera.lib.ru/db/kamanin_np/index.html * http://www.svengrahn.pp.se/histind/Cosmos146/Cosmos146.htm#data * https://www.hq.nasa.gov/pao/History/SP-4225/documentation/mhh/mirheritage.pdf Category:Kosmos satellites Category:Soviet space probes Category:Zond program Category:Spacecraft launched in 1967 Category:1967 in the Soviet Union ","title":"Kosmos 146"},{"id":"56587411","text":"Dante Panzeri (November 5, 1921 in Las Varillas, C√≥rdoba ‚Äì April 14, 1978 in Buenos Aires) was a sports journalist and columnist who was notable for the influence of his opinions and analysis about sports, specially in football, having changed the way of covering sports events in Argentina.Burgues√≠a y Gangsterismo en el Deporte Analysis on Librer√≠a Deportiva Panzeri is widely considered one of the most notable sports journalists ever in Argentina. Most his work was published on El Gr√°fico, where Panzeri worked for almost 20 years. ==Biography== Born in Las Varillas, a small town of C√≥rdoba, Panzeri spent his childhood in the city of San Francisco of the same province. Before the age of 20, he moved to Buenos Aires. Panzeri joined sports magazine El Gr√°fico in 1943,Dante Panzeri, el francotirador by Carlos Aira, 3 Feb 2017 writing articles about athletics, cycling, swimming, among others. His articles about football would come much later. Panzeri's articles about football were notables for the way he dealt with the sport, with emphasis on analysing the game rather than writing a simple chronicle. By the late 1940s, Panzeri was one of the most renowned journalists of El Gr√°fico along with Ricardo Lorenzo Rodr√≠guez (mostly known for his nickname Borocot√≥) and F√©lix Frascara. In the 1950s Panzeri became director of the magazine. During his tenure as director, he brought to the magazine sports journalists such as Pepe Pe√±a, Osvaldo Ardizzone and former Boca Juniors player Ernesto Lazzatti. Panzeri opposed to the excessive use of tactics in football, with Juan Carlos Lorenzo, Osvaldo Zubeld√≠a, Argentino Geronazzo and Jos√© D'√Åmico as some trainers that were accused of being excessively obsessed with tactics. Close to Ernesto Lazzatti and Adolfo Pedernera, Panzeri alleged that the use of tactics distorted the essence of the game.Hoy hubiese cumplio 99 a√±os El Gr√°fico by Ernesto Cherquis Bialo on Infobae, 30 Jan 2018 After the 1962 FIFA World Cup held in Chile, Panzeri left his charge in El Gr√°fico, after he was pressed to publish advertisements of then Ministry of Economy, Alvaro Alsogaray. He refused alleging the spirit of the magazine would be distorted if he had agreed to that.Panzeri: anatom√≠a de un periodista by Andr√©s Burgo, El Gr√°fico, 8 Dec 2013 Panzeri continued his career as journalist in As√≠ magazine. In 1965 he had his own TV program, \\"Discusiones por Deporte\\" in Canal 7. In 1966 he worked as correspondent for newspaper Cr√≥nica at the 1966 FIFA World Cup. Panzeri in a TV studio, during a discussion on the 1978 World Cup In 1967, Panzeri's first book, F√∫tbol: Din√°mica de lo Impensado, was published. The title expressed the idea that beyond the tactics and strategy planned by a coach, it was the player who decided on the field.Derribando mitos: f√∫tbol, din√°mica de lo impensado by Ignacio Fusco, La Naci√≥n, 20 Nov 2016 In Din√°mica de lo Impensado Panzeri expressed his preference for the \\"pure talent\\" of the Argentine footballer,F√∫tbol es f√∫tbol (y tambi√©n literatura) by Paula Corroto on Publico.es showing also his concern about the lost of the sport as a simple game and the establishment of an industry around it.F√∫tbol: Din√°mica de lo Impensado During the 1970s, Panzeri worked for several media such as newspaper La Opini√≥n and magazines Satiric√≥n and Goles. He was also chief of the sports section of newspaper La Prensa until his death in 1978. His work on the radio include \\"Radioshow\\", a program broadcast by Radio Del Plata. In 1974, he published a second book, Burgues√≠a y gangsterismo en el deporte,Burgues√≠a y gangsterismo, como advirti√≥ Panzeri by Gustavo Veiga, P√°gina/12, 4 Oct 2015 where he took readers behind the scenes at Argentine football's environment, describing the corruption and decadence of executives, coaches, journalists and even supporters.Burgues√≠a y gansterismo (description) Panzeri's strong character led him to confront football executives such as Ra√∫l Colombo and Alberto Armando, and even colleagues Bernardo Neustadt and Pepe Pe√±a. Panzeri also opposed the 1978 FIFA World Cup was held in Argentina, arguing that \\"it would be a waste of money\\". About his position, Admiral Carlos Lacoste used to tell an anecdote referring a visit he made to Panzeri's house to convince him about the convenience of holding the Cup in Argentina, with no satisfactory results. Otherwise, Panzeri almost convinced his wife, in Lacoste's own words. Panzeri died in April 1978, two months before the World Cup that finally would be won by Argentina.Panzeri by Ezequiel F.

All his surviving works are now in Bavaria ==Life== Known as 'il Paduano' (the Paduan) despite actually being born in Florence, he was a relative (possibly brother- in-law) of Friedrich Sustris, with whom he collaborated on several works in Augsburg, Munich, Kirchheim and especially the Burg Trausnitz in Landshut. The Burg contains his most notable works, the 1578 Narrentreppe or Ladder of Fools, a staircase with life-size commedia dell'arte frescoes by Scalzi and Sustris along the stairwell and its ceiling and grotesque masks of Pantalone and Zanni by Antonio Ponzano. The work is based on an actual Italian theatre troupe which performed at the wedding feast of William V of Bavaria and Renata of Lorraine.

It is an area of scholarship aimed at making sense of the place of digital leisure ‚Äúin understandings of embodiment, power relations, social inequalities, social structures and social institutions‚Äù. To do so, leisure scholars use theoretical and methodological approaches from within leisure studies as well as from other academic disciplines such as political science, history, communication studies, cultural studies, philosophy, sociology, geography, anthropology, and others. Scholars in this field also focus on how to engage digital practices to make their research accessible, and focus on exposing, examining, and challenging social inequalities and injustices related to digital leisure. ==Digital leisure== Digital leisure, similar to leisure, is a contentious term. Leisure has traditionally been defined in three main ways, as time (that which is not work), as activity (freely chosen), and as a state of mind (denoted by such things as intrinsic motivation, perceived freedom, and positive affect). Digital leisure practices and spaces are intertwined with work in ways that physical leisure spaces are not. Widespread surveillance of digital leisure practices and spaces allows companies to benefit monetarily from the data collected during the users‚Äô leisure experiences (hence, the user is indeed working during their leisure time). Therefore, digital leisure is time spent engaged in digital practices and spaces while in a leisurely state of mind. ==Digital leisure cultures== Traditionally, leisure scholars have focused on analogue leisure cultures such as sports, outdoor activities, fandom, and summer camps. In a digital age, there are very few (if any) pure analogue leisure spaces in existence. Most leisure cultures have been digitized in some way. With wearable fitness trackers digitizing every aspect of our leisure (even our sleep) and smartphones-turned-watches, our very leisured bodies have become digital assemblages. Lupton noted how the metaphor of entanglement is commonly used to explain our relationship with digitization, as it ‚Äúemphasizes the inextricably intertwined relationships of human subjects with material objects‚Äù (p. 41). As such, digital leisure cultures refer to the digitization of previous analogue areas of leisure research . Digital leisure cultures ‚Äúcovers some of the following technologies and practices which have built cultures around them: namely apps (applications), smartphones, online games, interaction on some form of social media, and the downloading of films, live televised sports events and music‚Äù. Brabazon has identified two systemic ways in which analogue leisure cultures and digital cultures differ: deterritorialization and disintermediation. Deterritorilization refers to the ways digitization is post-territory. As a concept, it captures ‚Äúhow particular media platforms and communicative systems de-emphasize our position in analogue space and time in favour of virtual space and time‚Äù. For example, Brabazon used the example of social media. We can join Pinterest, Twitter, Facebook ‚Äì and we can be involved in and share content in each of these distinct spaces with each other, even if we do not share physical space with each other. Disintermediation refers to the ways in which digital leisure cultures involve ‚Äúpeer-to-peer networks where links are removed from the traditional supply chain‚Äù . As part of these networks, the producer can also be the consumer (prosumer). In this way, material in digital leisure cultures can be created and disseminated much more quickly than in analogue leisure cultures. == Digital turn: theories and methodologies == Leisure studies (and academia in general) currently exists in the age of the ‚Äúdigital turn.‚Äù The digital turn refers to the different ways digitization influences our lives, including our behaviors, social interactions, environments, economies, and politics. The digital turn signifies a new period in leisure scholarship and demands a conceptual change, one in which leisure scholars turn to new resources and ways of capturing what digitization means for our lives and leisure Redheadnoted, leisure scholars ‚Äúneed to produce sustained theorizing of the ‚Äúdigital turn‚Äù in Leisure Studies and with it more satisfactory theoretically informed empirical studies of digital leisure cultures‚Äù (p. 828) to engage in broader scholarly conversations. To do so, it has been suggested leisure scholars shift the ways they are thinking about leisure and draw on different disciplines and theories as resources to begin to shape digital leisure theory and theorizing. For example, Redhead has recommended that digital leisure theory be shaped by critical theory and critical theorists from other disciplines such as philosophers, including Braudrillard, Badiou, Zizek, and Virilio. Redhead presented two concepts to guide digital leisure theory: accelerated culture and claustropolitanism. Karl Spracklen has presented a theory of communicative and instrumental digital leisure drawing on theorists such as Habermas, Catells, Urry, and Bauman. He argued that digital leisure is more communicative given its possibilities for interactivity and resisting power disparities, but despite these possibilities, it is not immune to instrumental structures that shape traditional (non-digitized) popular leisure. In this way, digital leisure should not be seen as something novel, but as ‚Äújust another leisure space.‚Äù In his work, he has also emphasized the work of leisure theorists, such as Rojek, Stebbins, Aitchison, Blackshaw, Giulianotti and Crouch, who have focused attention towards understanding and critically engaging with digital leisure. With the digital turn in research, also comes the need to consider methodologies and methods used to effectively study digital leisure cultures. Digital leisure scholars are still actively working to envision new methodologies and methods and retool existing ones. Netnography, virtual ethnography /cyberethnography/digital ethnography, digital storytelling , digital and visual methodologies , digital media methodologies , and critical technocultural discourse analysis are some examples of such methodologies and methods. == References == Category:Leisure Leisure Category:Leisure activities Category:Social dynamics ","title":"Digital leisure studies"},{"id":"56587471","text":"Bweengwa is a constituency of the National Assembly of Zambia.

Wright attended Georgia State College, where his father served as college president. Wright attended the University of Chicago in 1898, where he found mentors in William Rainey Harper and Shailer Mathews. In 1903 Wright studied in Berlin, Germany, in part inspired by the academic path of W.E.B. DuBois.

He was the first African American to earn a PhD from the University of Pennsylvania. Education was one of the building blocks that defined him. Early in life he studied under his father, who was a huge role model. Georgia State College was the first college he attended, where his father was the president. Georgia State College was a technical college that offered very few classical courses. Wright graduated from Georgia State College in 1898; he then enrolled in the Divinity School at the University of Chicago. The University of Chicago, had a significant impact on his life. Here he was introduced to biblical studies where he then followed his path into ministry. Soon after he received his Bachelor of Divinity Degree and Masters in Biblical Languages he gained an interest in sociology. This interest led him to the University of Pennsylvania, where he followed W.E.B. DuBois and studied the Philadelphia Negro. After several years at University of Chicago Wright went to study in Berlin, Germany in 1903 (43), in part inspired by the academic path of W.E.B. DuBois. Wright studied in Berlin for a term then went to the University of Leipzig (45) where he wrote his thesis (The Historicity of the Acts of the Apostles) (46).

It was in this editorial position that Wright focused on social welfare, becoming a leading advocate on migrant rights during the Great Migration. During his editorship, Wright was also deeply involved in banking, founding the Citizen's and Southern Bank Building along with his father, Richard R. Wright. Wright advocated for African American self-owned banks that served not only as a financial institution, but as a symbol of independence and self-reliance. In 1928, Wright returned to serving the ministry as the pastor of the Ward AME Church in Philadelphia. In 1932, Wright moved from Philadelphia to Wilberforce, Ohio, to serve as the 9th President of Wilberforce University.

Wright, an American military officer, educator and college president, politician, civil rights advocate and banking entrepreneur. Wright defined his early life by his religious devotion. As a child Wright used to play church and preached to other neighborhood children. At thirteen Wright became a Sunday school teacher at his church. These early childhood experiences contributed to Wright's later decision to join the ministry. Wright was also inclined towards social justice at a young age. His father actively instilled in his to have black role models like W.E.B. DuBois and to pursue careers that would help others. In regards to his decision to join the ministry Wright said > ‚ÄúI was much inclined toward law; to devoting my life to getting my people‚Äôs > legal rights, which were being increasingly denied. Still back of my mind > was that one desire to preach. I had never seen but one colored lawyer.‚Äù He was married to Charlotte Wright n√©e-Crogman, daughter the Wright's family friend Dr. William H.

The two were married for 49 years, until her death in 1959. They had four children together Ruth, Richard III, Alberta Lavina, and Grace Lydia . Wright was an avid reader, sportsman, particularly swimming, baseball, and tennis. He disdained dancing, drinking, and card playing. As a democrat, he was a public supporter of John F.

The funds for the Memorial were raised entirely by Falkland Islanders and it was unveiled by the Governor of the Falkland Islands, Sir Rex Hunt, on Liberation Day (14 June) 1984, the second anniversary of the end of the war. ==Design== The Memorial consists of an obelisk on the front of which is the coat of arms of the Falkland Islands surrounded by a laurel wreath above the words \\"In Memory of Those Who Liberated Us\\" and the date the war ended; \\"14 June 1982\\". On top of the obelisk is a bronze figure of Britannia, the female personification of the island of Great Britain. On the back and sides of the Memorial are the lists of the British Army regiments, RAF squadrons, Royal Navy vessels and the Royal Marine formations and units that took part in the conflict. The names of the 255 British military personnel who died during the war are listed on ten plaques behind the Memorial, divided into the service branches. Directly behind the Memorial is a relief depicting famous moments during the war.

He eventually became a military commissioner of Huamachi near Ningxia, and more promotions and rewards from the court followed, despite official complaints of unruliness caused by Pubei and his sons. In 1589 Pubei was promoted to regional vice commander of Ningxia and his son Bo Cheng'en took up his old post. At this point he had with him 3,000 personal retainers and wished to retire, handing over the post to his son. However Grand Coordinator Dang Xin refused the transfer of power. Over the next three years Pubei and Dang Xin clashed over a number of issues. Dang refused to supply Pubei's personal retainers on the grounds that they weren't in the employ of the government, and therefore not eligible for government support. Dang also flogged Bo Cheng'en in public, apparently for attempting to steal another official's wife. Following that, he ordered the arrest of Pubei's followers after their return from a campaign to the northwest. Pubei followed government protocols and tried to seek redress from the government, but this only angered Dang more. In March 1592 a Han officer called Liu Dongyang mutinied and killed Dang Xin. They seized some 47 fortresses in the outlying area and demanded autonomy from the Ming government or else they would ally with the Ordos Mongols. News of the rebellion reached the court on 19 April 1592. ==Battle== Wei Xueceng was invested with full authority by the Wanli Emperor and dispatched commanders to defend the south bank of the Yellow River. The border fortresses were retaken within a few weeks until only Ningxia was left. However at this point Wei complained that he did not have the necessary manpower or resources to take the city. He lobbied for a peaceful solution to the crisis. The stalemate lasted for six weeks. Ming forces entrenched themselves around Ningxia but were continuously harassed by Mongol horsemen. An attempted assault on the city resulted in the defeat of 3,000 rebels and the recovery of some military equipment, but Ming forces were unable to breach the city defenses, suffering heavy casualties. Mongol forces raided nearby cities and cut off the Ming supply lines, encircling the entrenched Ming positions. Li Rusong and Ye Mengxiong were called in to resolve the situation. Ye Mengxiong arrived at the nearby city of Lingzhou on 14 July with 400 cannons, fire carts, and a contingent of Miao troops from the southwest. The Ming divided their forces into five armies, four for each gate, and a mobile corps under Ma Gui. Two weeks later Pubei's men sallied out and engaged in battle with Ma Gui. Both sides suffered heavy losses, but Pubei was repelled with cannon fire. Apparently the rebels' Mongol allies were supposed to attack from the rear during the battle but they refused. Li Rusong and Mei Guozhen arrived by the end of July and bombarded the city walls with cannon fire which did nothing. On 2 August, Li Ruzhang, Li Rusong's brother, attempted to scale the walls with ladders but failed. On 3 August, Gong Zijing attacked the south gate with Miao troops while Li Rusong tried to scale the walls, but they were repelled by arrows and cannon fire. They tried again in the night but failed again. The Wanli Emperor grew frustrated with the situation and dismissed Wei Xueceng, replacing him with Ye Mengxiong. A new plan to flood the city was approved and the army began constructing dikes around Ningxia. The dikes were completed 23 August. Pubei tried to send for help, but his dispatch was ambushed and killed. Nevertheless, Ming forces under Ma Gui and Dong Yiyuan were sent out to deal with the Mongol chieftain Bushugtu. Except for one loss, the Ming were able to drive away the Mongols. The city was flooded and by 6 September, the water around the city walls were nine feet deep. The situation within the city was desperate. Officers were eating horses while commoners ate tree bark. On 7 September a section of the dike southeast of the city collapsed and the rebels attempted to escape in boats, but were repelled. Mei Guozhen called for their surrender on 17 September but received no response. On 25 September the rebels bombarded the Ming forces from atop the city walls while Mongol leader Jorightu attacked from the north with a force of 18,000. Li Rusong and Ma Gui repelled the Mongols in an encircling maneuver. By 12 October the north wall had collapsed under the water and Ming soldiers were able to take the south wall. Seeing this, the rebel leaders fell upon themselves in hopes of clemency. Bo Cheng'en surrendered while Pubei committed suicide through self-immolation. ==Aftermath== Li Rusong was promoted to supreme commander, Ye Mengxiong became censor in chief of the right, and Xiao Ruxun became vice commissioner in chief. Li Rusong was then hurried to Korea to defend it from the Japanese. Wei Xueceng was released from prison and restored to his official rank, but he died at home in obscurity. ==References== ==Bibliography== * .

It is located at the edge of the North Downs where the A229 meets the Pilgrims' Way. A pub has existed in the general area since around 1790, when the A229 was a turnpike road for coaches. The map maker and artist Paul Sandby painted A Distant View of Maidstone, from Lower Bell Inn, Boxley Hill in 1802, which depicts a view of the town from the pub. It is marked at its current location on a large-scale 1832 map of Kent. The current building was constructed in 1865. The purpose of the bell was for travellers to warn others further up the hill of their presence, as the road was too narrow for two teams of coach and horses to pass each other. There was a corresponding pub at the top of the hill called The Upper Bell, which would ring in response. The Upper Bell was demolished in 2013. The Lower Bell is cited as a location for a common ghost story, which originates from a fatal car accident involving a bride-to-be on the A229 outside the premises in November 1965. The typical story involves the apparition of a young woman attempting to hitch a lift outside the pub into the centre of Maidstone or another local village, who subsequently vanishes en route. A local journalist attempted to verify the story for the Maidstone Gazette in 1968, but was unable to find any suitable eyewitnesses after months of research. In 2015, on the fiftieth anniversary of the accident, a paranormal enthusiasts group met in the Lower Bell to discuss the various ghost stories. A short film, entitled The Ghost of Blue Bell Hill, was shot around the premises. Live music is a regular feature at the Lower Bell. The pub runs a jam session every Monday. ==References== Category:Pubs in Kent Category:Reportedly haunted locations in South East England ","title":"Lower Bell"},{"id":"56587983","text":"Ori Naftaly (born 1987) is an Israeli-born guitarist, composer and music producer.

On 22 June 2018, Sajjan Singh Rangroot's exclusive internet rights was acquired by SHAREit == Plot == In the present, many Sikh volunteers come to the Syria-Iraq border to help out refugees. An elderly Sikh volunteer tells his volunteers (especially a curious girl) about Sajjan Singh Rangroot, a soldier who fought in World War I. In the early 20th century, Sajjan was a young Sikh man who disliked the British. Sajjan‚Äôs father worked for the British. Sajjan‚Äôs father wanted Sajjan to work for the British as well. As World War 1 was going on, Sajjan wanted to be a soldier for the British Indian army. He hoped that if the British won, India would gain independence. His father disliked the idea, but his mother was not against it. So Sajjan joins the army after an emotional farewell from his family. He becomes friends with many other soldiers like Dheera, Teja, Lacchman Das and Mela Singh. Teja was an arrogant person and Mela Singh was a person who lied a lot to get attention. Him lying leads to hilarious reactions. The Subedar (Leader) of the group was Zorawar Singh who has fought many wars before. After rigorous training, the group reach Britain to fight. The group were the Lahore Regiment. When the regiment reach Britain, many British soldiers make fun of the Sikhs. The soldiers train even more. At a tea shop Sajjan and one British soldier try to have a fight, but the owner of the shop who is called Becky stops them as she does not want the tables and chairs to break. Sajjan then leaves the soldier alone. Becky then starts to like Sajjan. Sajjan finds out but he is betrothed to someone called Jeeti. The Sikhs and British find out that the Germans have invaded many British trenches. So the British and Sikhs have to get to a trench before the Germans attack. This is as the trench will protect them. During that, the Germans attack. However, the Sikhs and British get the trench and later capture the main German trench line, forcing the Germans to retreat. But Dheera dies during that. Sajjan becomes really disturbed but Zorawar makes Sajjan better. The Germans find out that Sikhs are helping the British in war. So, the Germans send them a letter. The letter says that the Sikhs should join the Germans as they will get better equipment, food and more salary. Sajjan refuses as Sikhs should not be traitors. After a month of staying in the trenches, Mela Singh tells Sajjan that it is Baisakhi. But the Baisakhi is a sad one. So Sajjan tries to make everyone happy by singing a song. After, the Germans attack the trench and the Sikhs and the British escape. The Germans take over the trench. Teja dies during that. So Sajjan decides go in the battlefield alone and bomb the trench. Sajjan is successful and all Germans in the trench die. However, Sajjan dies as well. In India, the British and the people pay their respects to Sajjan. In the present, the elderly Sikh volunteer shows the curious girl a photo of Zorawar and Sajjan. The Sikh volunteers now feel motivated to be like Sajjan Singh Rangroot. == Cast == * Diljit Dosanjh as Sep. Sajjan Singh * Yograj Singh as Sub. Zorawar Singh * Darren Tassell Sgt.

In 1997, Raven made an exclusive publishing deal with Activision, and the Raffel brothers subsequently sold the company to Activision. Several employees left the company then to form Human Head Studios. Raven spent the next decade working on a few original games such as Soldier of Fortune, as well as licensed games, including the Star Wars games Star Wars Jedi Knight II: Jedi Outcast (2002) and Star Wars Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy (2003) and the X-Men games X-Men Legends (2004) and Marvel: Ultimate Alliance (2006).

The family formed part of the so-called 'Cabang Atas', or the Chinese gentry of colonial Indonesia. Kampong Gang Zecha was an area in colonial Jakarta named after the Lauw-Sim-Zecha family. ==Origin and rise== Lauw Ho, the founding father of the family, was a prominent pachter or revenue farmer in Batavia between 1845 and 1861, as well as one of the city's wealthiest tycoons. He was also part of the powerful Ngo Ho Tjiang partnership that dominated the opium monopoly in Batavia. He served as Wijkmeester (ward master) of Meester Cornelis, a junior position in the civil bureaucracy. While Lauw Ho failed to secure an elevation to the prestigious Chinese officership, which was a high-ranking civil government post, his two sons ‚Äì Lauw Tek Kang and Lauw Tek Lok (died in 1887) ‚Äì were both appointed Luitenants der Chinezen of Meester Cornelis and Bekasi respectively on December 23, 1854. They also became important Landheeren or landlords through their acquisition of significant agricultural landholdings ('particuliere landen') in the Ommelanden or rural hinterland of Batavia, including the estate of Tjimanggis (now Cimanggis). The brothers' acquisition of Chinese lieutenancies and landed estates marked their entry into the ranks of the Cabang Atas. Luitenant Lauw Tek Lok, who served in office with distinction until his death in 1882, nonetheless caused some consternation among the colonial authorities due to his unconventional, interracial marriage with an Indo-Bohemian woman, Louisa Zecha. On being widowed in 1882, Zecha further scandalized colonial society by marrying her dead husband's former private secretary-turned-magnate Sim Keng Koen, who later had a distinguished government career as the first Kapitein der Chinezen of Sukabumi, a colonial hill station in the Preanger highlands of West Java. As the historian Mely G. Tan notes, the Lauw-Sim-Zecha family lived in a grand style as the premier gentry family of Sukabumi, where most of the extended clan settled down. ==Later history== Luitenant Lauw Tek Lok and Louisa Zecha's grandson, Aristide William Lauw-Zecha, became the first Indonesian-born graduate of an American university (Iowa University in 1923), and was a prominent plantation owner. Kapitein Sim Keng Koen and Louisa Zecha's youngest son, Chester Lauw-Sim-Zecha, was also an important community and business leader, as well as a Freemason, in the first half of the twentieth century. The family, however, lost their vast landholdings and assets due to the Indonesian Revolution (1945-1950) and President Sukarno's nationalization of private landed estates in 1952. In the aftermath of the revolution, many members of the Lauw-Sim-Zecha family, like other scions of the Cabang Atas, left Indonesia and settled overseas. Notable members of the family today include the Malaysian royal Che Engku Chesterina (n√©e Lauw-Sim- Zecha) and her cousin, Adrian Lauw-Zecha, son of A. W. Lauw-Zecha and the founder of Aman Resorts. Lauw-Zecha's son, Ajai, is married to the Singaporean actress Michelle Saram. ==References== Category:Cabang Atas Category:Indonesian families Category:People from Batavia, Dutch East Indies Category:People from Jakarta Category:People of the Dutch East Indies Category:Indonesian people of Chinese descent Category:Indonesian people of Czech descent Category:Indo people ","title":"Lauw-Sim-Zecha family"},{"id":"56588256","text":"Georgy Arturovich Baevsky (; 11 July 1921 6 May 2005) was a flying ace in the 5th Guards Fighter Aviation Regiment of the 11th Guards Fighter Aviation Division during the Second World War who was awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union on 4 February 1944 and later went on to become a test pilot and major general of the Soviet Air Force. == Early life == Baevsky was born on 11 July 1921 to a Russian family in Rostov-on-Don in the Russian SFSR. His father, Abram Baevsky, was a Soviet intelligence officer who lived under the pseudonym Artur and worked in the cinema industry. Georgy started attending school in Moscow in 1929 but not for long because his family moved to Germany. He became fluent in German during the three years he lived there before the family relocated again, to Sweden. In 1937 the family returned to Russia, settling in Moscow where Georgi began his aviation career at the flight club when he was a teenager before entering flight school. == Military career == Baevsky joined the military in May 1940 after graduating from the Dzerzhinsky Aeroclub flight school in 1939. In November 1940 Baevsky was promoted to the rank of junior lieutenant and assigned as a flight instructor to the Serpukhov flight school. In 1941 he was transferred to the Chkalov Central Aeroclub in Northwest Moscow where he worked until he was sent to the front in April 1943 in the 5th Guards Fighter Aviation Regiment of the 1st Guards Mixed Aviation Corps of the 17th Air Army. His first experience of aerial combat was with a Bf 109 on 27 April 1943. During the war he participated in aerial combat in the Battles for Berlin, Kursk, Dnieper, and Warsaw; by December 1943 he had completed 144 combat sorties and was nominated for the title Hero of the Soviet Union which he received on 4 February 1944. By the end of the war he had completed 252 sorties in 52 different aerial battles, for which he became flying ace for having personally shot down 19 enemy aircraft in total while flying a Lavochkin La-5. After the war Baevsky attended the Zhukovsky Air Force Engineering Academy and became a test pilot for the air force after graduating, starting his job at the Chkalov Air Force Test Center in 1951 where he worked until entering the Military Academy of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Russia which he graduated in 1962. In his career as a test pilot he became a skilled pilot of 77 different aircraft types and was heavily involved in the testing of the MiG-25 in Egypt. By the time he retired from the military in 1985 he had risen to the rank of Major-General and had become the Deputy Chief of the Zhukovsky Academy where he had previously been a student. == Later life == After leaving the military Baevskyserved as the chairman of the council of veterans of the 5th Guards Fighter Aviation Regiment.

The railway company was established in 1899 and the line opened in 1902. Many railways in Italy were nationalized in 1905 but the Ferrovia Alta Valtellina escaped and was not nationalized until 1970. ==History== In 1899 a company was established for the Alta Valtellina Railway (FAV) with the aim of connecting Sondrio with Tirano. It obtained the concession in August of the same year and started construction work. The line, called the Alta Valtellina, was a natural continuation of the Valtellina Line (Sondrio-Lecco) and the service was inaugurated on 29 June 1902.http://www.trenidicarta.it/aperture.html Initially it was operated by steam traction using four Henschel steam locomotives. Numbers 1-3 were 0-4-0T and number 4 was a 0-6-0T of the Prussian T 3 type. Three more Prussian T 3s, numbers 5-7, arrived later. FAV No.6 is preserved.http://www.steamlocomotive.info/country.cfm?which=italy On 1 July 1908, the Tirano-St.Moritz line was activated by the Swiss private company Berninabahn (now part of the Rhaetian Railway) which allowed the connection of the Upper Tellina Valley with the Swiss slopes of the region. ==Electrification== In 1932 the line was electrified using the same three- phase system as the Ferrovia della Valtellina. Four electric locomotives were used and they became FAV Class E.440. Numbers 1-3 were built by Costruzioni Elettro Meccaniche di Saronno (CEMSA). Number 4 was built by Tecnomasio Italiano Brown Boveri (TIBB). In 1967, due to the declining popularity of three-phase traction, the line was de-electrified and operated by diesel- powered trains of type ALn 556 chartered from Ferrovie dello Stato Italiane (FS). In 1970, the line was nationalized and became part of the FS network. On 29 May 1980, electric traction was re-introduced using the 3 kV direct current system. From 1981 the first direct trains from Milan to Tirano were established. ==Upgrade programme== In the mid-1980s, the line was the subject of a larger programme to upgrade the route from Milan for a cost of about 100 billion lire, which involved the activation of Centralized Traffic Control (CTC) between Sondrio and Tirano, with a Central Manager in Colico. As part of this plan, in 1986 the stations of Chiuro, San Giacomo di Teglio, Bianzone and Villa di Tirano were downgraded to halts. ==Service reduction== Since 2008, train services have been progressively reduced from 19 to 13, and in June 2014 there was a further reduction.

The lid is the equivalent of the lithosphere in plate tectonics, formed of solid silicate minerals (or solid ice in the case of icy planets and moons). The relative stability and immobility of the strong cooler lids leads to stagnant lid tectonics, which has greatly reduced amounts of horizontal tectonics compared with plate tectonics (which can also be described as mobile lid tectonics). The presence of a stagnant lid above a convecting mantle was recognised as a possible stable regime for convection on Earth, in contrast to the well-attested mobile plate tectonics of the current eon. == Formation == A lid tectonic regime arises when the cold upper lithosphere is too viscous to participate in the underlying flow of the mantle.Ogawa, M., Schubert, G., Zebib, A., 1991.

This relationship relies heavily on the ratio of lithospheric strength to natural convective stresses.O'Neill, C., Jellinek, A.M., Lenardic, A., 2007a. Conditions for the onset of plate tectonics on terrestrial planets and moons. Earth Planet. Sci. Lett. 261, 20‚Äì32. Hence, if lithospheric strength is greater than convective stresses, then there are stagnant lid tectonics. == Factors contributing to lid tectonics == Many characteristics of a planetary body influence the presence and degree of lid tectonics. The temperature of a body's core‚Äìmantle boundary, and the presence of water, strongly affect the rheological, composition, and thermal diagnostics of lid tectonics. The lid will not participate in the underlying convection of the mantle. At the base of the lithosphere, where the lid is in contact with less viscous material, melts will form at the thermal boundary layer and cause drips, believed to be of peridotite composition. This stagnant lid regime will not effectively mix a mantle. == Other planetary bodies == Stagnant lid regime is the most common type of plate tectonics style that exists in the solar systemStern, R.J., 2008.

It was founded by Nova Spivack and Nick Slavin in 2015 and incorporated in 2016. ==Project== The foundation plans \\"multiple...Arch libraries intended to preserve and disseminate humanity's knowledge across time and space for the benefit of future generations\\". The foundation is technology agnostic and will use whichever storage technology is best for its purposes including multiple technologies. The first method used is \\"5D laser optical data storage in quartz\\", which will reportedly remain readable for up to 14 billion years, resist cosmic radiation, and can withstand temperatures up to 1,000¬∞C. The foundation also plans on spinning off companies based on patents from research groups involved with the technologies it uses to fund itself in the future. ==Data Archives== ===Arch disks 1 through 5 === As a proof of concept of the 5D optical data storage technology, Arch made 5 disks each containing Isaac Asimov's Foundation trilogy comprising about 3 megabytes each. The disks were created by Peter Kazansky at the University of Southampton's Optoelectronics Research Centre (ORC), the inventor of the 5D optical data storage technology and who is on Arch Mission Foundation's \\"Science and Technology Council\\". The discs are considered the longest-lasting storage objects ever created by humans. ==Solar Library== In December 2017, when Arch co-founder Novak Spivack heard that SpaceX was launching a Tesla into space, Spivack tweeted Musk who jumped at the opportunity to include one on the mission - Musk was a book fan. Musk was also given the 1.1 disk for his private library. The 1.2 disk, named the 'Solar Library' by the Arch Mission Foundation also represents the first permanent space library, and is projected to orbit around the sun for at least a few million years. The Solar Library was launched on the SpaceX Falcon Heavy test flight on February 6, 2018, inside Musk's red Tesla Roadster. The payload was placed in an elliptical orbit that extends nearly 243 million miles from the sun at its farthest point. ==Other projects== Arch hopes to seed the solar system with millions and possibly billions of archives into \\"all kinds of locations\\". It wants to build a permanent library on the Moon and on Mars. Arch envisions its small light-weight disks might be an alternative means of moving large amounts of data between Earth and Mars as opposed to radio signals. Longer term they envision connecting the Arch Libraries through a decentralised read-write data sharing network that spans the Solar System. Data in the libraries will include Wikipedia, Project Gutenberg, human genomes and other large open-data sets. They will also allow donations of money to instruct that certain data be included, and will do so without censorship of what can be included. The foundation cites the likelihood that a being developed enough to find and read the information would already possess significant technology as the reason for not prioritizing scientific data sets. In February 2018, the Arch Mission successfully placed an archive called the Orbital Library, which contains a copy of Wikipedia, into low-earth orbit. The Arch Mission has also built a payload called the Lunar Library, which serves as a backup to planet Earth and contains scientific, cultural and historical information in almost 30 languages and several encyclopedias including Wikipedia. The Lunar Library was set to arrive on the Moon on the Israeli spacecraft Beresheet, but it crashed landed on the Moon in May 2019. Despite this, the 30-million page Lunar Library possibly survived due to the strength of its construction. == See also == * Time capsule * List of time capsules * Voyager Golden Record * Viking program * Rosetta Project ==References== ==External links== *Arch Mission Foundation *Stephen Wolfram article on teaching civilizations about humanity *Falcon Heavy launch video *Where is roadster website Category:Containers Category:Time capsules Category:Archaeological artifacts Category:Non- profit_organizations_based_in_the_United_States Category:Non-profit organizations based in Texas ","title":"Arch Mission Foundation"},{"id":"56588712","text":"Erich Prigge (1878‚Äì1955) was a German army officer, who served in both the German Imperial Army and the Ottoman Army during World War I, and ultimately attained the rank of Major. Prigge is best known as the long-serving adjutant to Marshal Otto Liman von Sanders (1914‚Äì19) and as a military memoirist. Erich Richard Julius Prigge was born on 19 March 1878 at Harsefeld in the Prussian Province of Hanover. His parents were from bourgeois families of the Rhine Province, distinguished in business and provincial administration. He was primarily raised by paternal relatives in Magdeburg. He was a cousin once removed of Ren√© K√∂nig. ==Military career== ===Education and pre-WWI years=== Destined for a military career from an early age, Prigge attended a regional cadet school (Kadettenschule), followed by two years‚Äô instruction (1894-6) at the Central Cadet Institution (Hauptkadettenanstalt) at Gro√ü-Lichterfelde. In 1896 he was posted to the 2. Rheinisches Husaren-Regiment Nr. 9, stationed at Trier, later relocated to Strassburg. Following a mandatory course at a War School (Kriegsschule), in 1897 he received his commission as Sekondelieutenant. In 1904-6 he was posted to the Military Riding Institute (Milit√§rreitinstitut) in Hanover. Thereafter he served as an inspection officer (Inspektionsoffizier) at the War Schools in Neisse and Glogau. He was promoted to Oberleutnant on 1908 and transferred to the War School in Potsdam, where he served as a riding instructor (Reitlehrer). In January 1913 he was promoted to Rittmeister and transferred to the Ulanen-Regiment von Schmidt (1. Pommersches) Nr. 4, based at Thorn.Rance (2017), pp. 67-70 In February 1914 Prigge retired from active duty in the Prussian Army prior to his transferral to the German Military Mission (Milit√§rmission) to the Ottoman Empire. On arrival in Istanbul, he was appointed commanding officer of the Ottoman Cavalry Non-Commissioned Officers‚Äô School at Ayazaƒüa. As a Rittmeister in the Prussian army, he was accorded the one-higher rank of Binba≈üƒ± (Major) in the Ottoman Army.Rance (2017), pp. 67-70 ===First World War=== On the outbreak of World War I in Europe in August 1914, Prigge was appointed as an adjutant to Marshal Liman von Sanders, a post he retained, with brief interruptions, until the end of the war. After Liman von Sanders was appointed commander-in-chief of the newly created Ottoman Fifth Army in March 1915, Prigge served at its headquarters on the Gallipoli Peninsula throughout the Dardanelles campaign. In May 1915 he was awarded the Iron Cross (First Class). In September 1915 he was instructed to write a semi-official account of the fighting, primarily to counter British propaganda. Completed even before the conclusion of combat operations, and based partly of personal observation, partly on official documentation and eyewitness reports, this narrative was published at the beginning of 1916 as Der Kampf um die Dardanellen (The Struggle for the Dardanelles).Maj. Erich R. Prigge, Der Kampf um die Dardanellen (Verlag Gustav Kiepenheuer: Weimar 1916), pp. 112 It is as one of the earliest published accounts of the campaign written by a combatant.

Liman von Sanders, F√ºnf Jahre T√ºrkei (Verlag August Scherl: Berlin 1920), pp. 145-6 Later in 1916, a revised and expurgated version of Prigge‚Äôs text was anonymously published as Gallipoli, der Kampf um den Orient (Gallipoli, the Struggle for the Orient), attributed to 'an officer of the staff of Marshal Liman von Sanders'.Anonymous [E.R. Prigge], Gallipoli, Der Kampf um den Orient. Von einem Offizier aus dem Stabe des Marschalls Liman von Sanders (Verlag August Scherl: Berlin 1916), pp. 117 Subsequently, Prigge remained with Liman von Sanders as his adjutant until 1919, apart from a tenth-month secondment to the Eastern Front in 1917. His final theatre of operations was in Palestine, where Liman von Sanders commanded the Yƒ±ldƒ±rƒ±m Army Group (1 March-30 October 1918). In April 1918 Prigge was promoted to Major temporarily without commission in the Prussian army, and correspondingly ranked as Kaymakam (Oberstleutnant) in the Ottoman Army. During the final phase of the campaign, he briefly served as acting chief of staff to the Army Group.Rance (2017), pp. 72-74 ===Interbellum=== Following the Armistice of Mudros, Prigge returned to Germany in early 1919 and retired from the army with the rank of Major (ret.).Ehren-Rangliste des ehemaligen Deutschen Heeres auf Grund der Ranglisten von 1914 mit den inzwischen eingetretenen Ver√§nderungen (Mittler & Sohn: Berlin 1926 [repr. 1987]) I, p. 21 He resided in Berlin, where he married and pursued diverse business interests. He was a member of the Bund der Asienk√§mpfer, later serving as its vice-chairman (c.1932-4). He remained well connected in political-military circles and participated in diplomatic activities involving the Republic of Turkey and Balkan countries. ===WWII and after=== During World War II he was conscripted into the Wehrmacht as a reserve officer (1940‚Äì44) and exercised various administrative functions in Baden. After the war, he became managing director of the Badisches Hilfswerk and subsequently of the Red Cross in Baden. He died at Locarno on 1 February 1955.Rance (2017), pp. 74-75 ==Writings== * Maj.

He obtained power in the cartel's military wing and was accused of hundreds of murders. He was considered to be ranked fifth within the cartel structure. He was a hit man, the boss of hit men and leader of a criminal group at the disposal of the Cartel, known as Los Priscos. His strident voice caused him to be nicknamed \\"Pinina\\". He was tall. Few photos of him are available. == Career == As a child, Arias lived in the Medellin commune, in Lovaina. He was born to a poor family. He became a thief at twelve, then joined a gang and finally became a hit man at age 15. One story holds that one day he went to a park near San Pedro cemetery, where he stole a music player from a car that belonged to Pablo Escobar. One of Pablo's men started asking around and found that Arias had broken into the car. He informed Pablo Escobar of the feat. Escobar then asked Pinina to be a member of the cartel. Arias had a vast knowledge of the people in the commune, which allowed him to recruit members for murder-for-hire. The first assassination ordered by the Medell√≠n Cartel, i.e., the assassination of Rodrigo Lara, was delegated to him. He then hired Byron de Jes√∫s Vel√°squez, Iv√°n Dar√≠o Guizao √Ålvarez and others to commit the assassination in 1984. Pinina participated in almost every criminal act ordered by the cartel: the assassinations of Lara and El Espectador director Guillermo Cano Isaza in 1986, the bombing of the El Espectador building in 1989, the assassination of Police Colonel Jaime Ram√≠rez G√≥mez in 1986, the kidnap and murder of Carlos Mauro Hoyos in 1988, the murder of the Antioquia governor Antonio Rold√°n Betancur in 1989, the assassination of the Police Colonel Valdemar Franklin Quintero in 1989, cooperation with the arrangement of the DAS Building bombing in 1989 (leaving 52 dead and at least 600 wounded), involvement in the bombing of an Avianca airplane on 27 November 1989 (110 people killed), participation in the killing of many police officers as well as the assassination of the magistrate of Colombian Supreme Court Hernando Baquero Borda in 1986, participation in the assassination of presidential candidate Luis Carlos Gal√°n in 1989 and the war between the Medellin Cartel and the Cali Cartel along with other criminal acts such as car bombings. == Death == Arias died on 13 June 1990, when the Colombian police raided his apartment in the neighborhood, El Poblado of Medell√≠n. He tried to escape through a window on the third floor, but fell, injuring his ankle, head and right arm. He was able to stand up and tried to walk to his car, but upon encountering the police, he retreated into the apartment building. On the first floor he engaged in a fight with police officers and was eventually killed. He was 29 years old at the time of his death. After his death, the Medell√≠n Cartel started to fall apart. In retaliation, Escobar ordered his men to put a car-bomb on the police station of El Poblado, causing severe damage. His body was buried in Campos de Paz cemetery in Medell√≠n. == Media == In 2012, Caracol Televisi√≥n premiered the series Pablo Escobar, The Drug Lord, inspired by the life of the cartel chief. In it, the character of John Jairo Arias was portrayed using the alias \\"El Chili\\". In the series Bloque de b√∫squeda, produced by Teleset for Sony Pictures Television, broadcast in 2016 and inspired by the police force that disbanded the Medell√≠n Cartel, his character was performed by the actor Sebasti√°n Bosc√°n, under the alias \\"Pinocho\\". == References == == External links == * Pinina: Un itinerario criminal Category:Medell√≠n Cartel traffickers Category:Colombian drug traffickers Category:1961 births Category:1990 deaths ","title":"John Jairo Arias Tasc√≥n 'Pinina'"},{"id":"56588744","text":"Kote Sangi () is a neighborhood and major intersection in western Kabul, Afghanistan, part of District 5.https://reliefweb.int/report/afghanistan/afghanistan-battles-insecurity- joblessness It is one of the city's most populated urban areas, located south of the Silo Road and west of Deh Bori and Kabul University.

The painting is sometimes known by the title Recuerdo (Memory).Memory, the Heart at fridakahlo.org The oil-on-metal work measures 40 x 28 cm, and is held in the collection of Michel Petitjean in Paris, France. ==Description== Kahlo portrays herself standing on a beach by the water's edge, one foot on the sand and one in the sea, looking towards the viewer with an expressionless face covered in tears. A metal rod goes through a large empty space in her chest. The rod has an image of Cupid at each end, shown as if riding a seesaw. Frida's heart is represented by a large bleeding mutilated organ lying outside her body. The blood from the heart seeps into the sand and flows into the sea. Two dresses, one a schoolgirl dress, the other her traditional Tehuantepec-style costume, hang near Frida; not empty, they contain one human arm apiece. The schoolgirl dress arm reaches for but does not touch Frida, while the arm in the Tehauna dress supports the armless and immobile artist.

Memento Mori (1993) is a composition for orchestra by Peter Sculthorpe. The title refers to the medieval Christian idea of memento mori, and the piece itself makes frequent references to the plainchant setting of the Latin hymn \\"Dies irae\\". == Conception == Laurie Strachan wrote in The Australian, when reviewing the piece on October 22, 1993, that \\"[t]he work was inspired by a visit to Easter Island, famous for its great stone heads, monuments that can be seen as both an example of the indomitable nature of the human spirit and as part of its great folly - for their making and transportation deforested and impoverished the island.\\" When composing, Memento Mori, Sculthorpe focused on the link between 'the personal notion of morality' and the 'extended environmental sense of fragility', using 'Easter Island as a parable for planet Earth and population growth'. Moai at Rano Raraku, Easter Island; a visit to Easter Island was where the composer gained inspiration for the composition. In the original programme notes, the composer described the way he conceived of the work: == Reception == The work has received mixed reviews. Joseph McLellan, writing in The Washington Post, stated that: Laurie Strachan, writing in The Australian, was similarly positive, writing that Memento Mori was 'one of [Sculthorpe's] most immediately appealing scores.' Strachan went on further to say that '[t]here are some hauntingly beautiful melodies and striking tonal contrasts. Some play is made of the plainchant Dies irae but this is not overdone and the whole thing ends on a note of quiet resolution that's absolutely right.‚Äô Conversely, Andrew Clements, while reviewing a CD of Sculthorpe's work for The Guardian, said that the Memento Mori was \\"the most conventional and least effective piece on [the] disc\\". == Instrumentation == The music is scored for two flutes (flute 2 doubling piccolo), two clarinets, two oboes, two bassoons, four horns, four trumpets, two trombones, bass trombone, tuba, timpani, percussion (two players), and strings. == Form == Memento Mori is in one movement and last for approximately 14 minutes. It is in common time and the tempo is lento. The piece opens with an introduction, which them leads into two statements of the Dies irae plainchant, part of the Latin mass for the dead: 687x687px Following this, the music oscillates between the pitches of G and A-flat. The composer notes that this is because the astronomer Kepler believed those pitches to be the sound of the planet Earth. Then there a further two statements of the Dies irae plainchant, by which the music reaches a solemn climax, followed by more somber music. == Commission and performance == The work was commissioned by the ABC for performance by West Australian Symphony Orchestra. It was first performed by the West Australian Symphony Orchestra, with Jorge Mester conducting, on July 2, 1993, in the Perth Concert Hall. It has subsequently been performed several times, most recently by the Queensland Conservatorium Symphony Orchestra, with Peter Morris conducting, on March 27, 2015. == References == Category:Compositions by Peter Sculthorpe Category:Compositions for symphony orchestra Category:Death in music Category:1993 compositions ","title":"Memento Mori (Sculthorpe)"},{"id":"56589216","text":"Sanne van Kerkhof (born 27 March 1987) is a Dutch former short track speed skater.

While Lucky was predominantly the bassist and musical director for Curtis Mayfield, his credits also include The Impressions, Aretha Franklin, Natalie Cole, The Staple Singers, Leroy Hutson, Gladys Knight, and more. He played a Fender Jazz bass with flat wound strings and had an aggressive right- hand plucking technique that was very percussive. Born in Chattanooga, Tennessee, Lucky began performing in the local music scene at a very young age. He was the nephew of The Impressions singer Sam Gooden. In 1968, The Impressions lost their road band in a tragic car accident on Interstate 85. Eager to continue working they assembled a new band that included Lucky. Despite not being able to read music Lucky went on to become the band leader for The Impressions for a number of years during a critical time in their careers. They were starting to perform at such staples as the Fillmore West and Dick Clark's American Bandstand. Not too long after this period in 1970 Curtis Mayfield left the band to pursue a solo career and took Lucky with him. Lucky went on to work extensively with Curtis Mayfield as his musical director and bassist. Oftentimes when working on new music Curtis and Lucky would sit down and write together which is likely why Curtis' music was so bass driven.

Following their parents' deaths, the Brooke children sold the property in the 1940s. The mansion served as a nursing home for thirty years, and recently as a bed and breakfast. The property spent fourteen years on and off the real estate market, before being sold at auction on September 29, 2018, for $572,000.Tony Phyrillas, \\"Brooke Mansion sold for $572,000,\\" The Mercury, September 30, 2018. ==Brooke family== Birdsboro was named for ironmaker William Bird, who established a forge near the mouth of Hay Creek, about 1740.Birdsboro Steel Foundry and Machine Company employee records, from University of Pennsylvania Archives. In 1771, his son Marcus founded Hopewell Furnace, on Hay Creek about five miles upstream. By the time of the Revolutionary War, Marcus Bird was the largest American producer of iron. He cast iron cannon, shot and shell for the Continental Army, and served in the Pennsylvania Militia.Hopewell Furnace in the American Revolution, from National Park Service. In the post-war depression he lost both forges to creditors in 1788. The creditors hired John Louis Barde to operate the forges, and Barde purchased the Birdsboro forge in 1796. He hired Matthew Brooke III to assist him, and after Barde's 1799 death Matthew continued to operate the forges for Barde's widow. In 1800, Matthew's father and uncles formed Brooke & Buckley and bought the Hopewell forge, with Matthew's brother Clement in charge. In 1805, at age 43, Matthew married Barde's 17-year-old daughter Elizabeth.George Norbury Mackenzie, Colonial Families of the United States of America, Volume 6, (Baltimore: The Seaforth Press, 1917), p. 102. Matthew and Elizabeth Brooke had five children, three of whom lived to adulthood: Edward (1816‚Äì1878); George (1818‚Äì1912); and Elizabeth Mary (1825‚Äì1870). Matthew died in 1827 and Elizabeth in 1828, leaving their orphaned children under the guardianship of Matthew's brother Clement. The Birdsboro forge was leased out to Brooke & Buckley until Edward and George attained their majorities. The Schuylkill Canal (completed 1825) passed through Birdsboro and, prior to railroads, was the primary means of transporting anthracite coal to Philadelphia and elsewhere. The young brothers took charge of the business in 1837, and diversified its holdings. They modernized the furnaces to run on anthracite (instead of charcoal), expanded their businesses, and consolidated them in 1867 as the Birdsboro Iron Forge Company. The Reading Railroad and the Pennsylvania Railroad both built lines through Birdsboro. The Brookes were behind the building of the Wilmington & Northern Railroad, a subsidiary of the Reading Company, that connected to their iron ore mines, and continued south to Wilmington, Delaware.Morton L. Montgomery, History of Berks County in Pennsylvania (Philadelphia: Everts, Peck & Richards, 1886), p. 895. Edward served as the railroad's first president. After their sister's 1870 death, the brothers bought out her interest and split the company into two entities ‚Äì the E. & G. Brooke Land Company (coal and iron ore mines) and the E. & G. Brooke Iron Company (iron and steel manufacture). The E. & G. Brooke Iron Company became Birdsboro Steel in 1905.G. Clymer Brooke, Birdsboro: Company with a Past, Built to Last, (New York: Newcomen Society in North America, 1959). Both Brooke brothers were keenly interested in architecture, and were clients of Frank Furness. Edward built a Greek Revival mansion, \\"Brooke Manor\\" (1844, demolished 1968) on a hill overlooking the town. In the mid-1870s, he hired Furness to modernize and expand it.Brooke Manor House, from HABS. George designed and oversaw construction of St. Michael's Episcopal Church, in the early 1850s. Twenty years later, he did the same for its Sunday school building (1872‚Äì73), which he and his brother donated. George designed his own Second Empire mansion, \\"Brookewood\\" (1860, burned 1917), and its many additions. After Edward's 1878 death, George selected Furness to design a major expansion of St. Michael's Church, 1884‚Äì85. This included the addition of transepts, a chancel and choir, a bell tower, and new church furniture (possibly executed by Daniel Pabst). George again oversaw the project, and he and his family paid for the expansion. The east transept was altered in 1887 for the installation of a Tiffany window,Edward Brooke Memorial Window, from Alarmy. a memorial to Edward from his widow, Annie Moore Clymer Brooke. ===Edward Brooke II=== Panoramic view of Birdsboro, 1890. George Brooke married Mary Baldwin Irwin in 1862. They had two sons, Edward II (1863‚Äì1940), named for George's brother; and George Jr. (1867‚Äì1953). The boys grew up in Philadelphia and Birdsboro, and were educated by private tutors. The family had a Philadelphia city house at 924 Walnut Street, and the sons attended the nearby Delancey School. Edward II graduated from the University of Pennsylvania in 1886, and joined his father's iron and steel business. In an October 12, 1887 wedding at St. Michael's Church, Edward II married his second cousin, Anne Louise Clingan. The groom gave the bride the not-quite-finished house as a wedding present: > He is now engaged in building a magnificent mansion at a high elevation > overlooking Birdsboro and the entire Schuylkill valley.

Frank Furness's brother Horace was chosen to head the building committee, and the architect began drawing up detailed plans even before the project was officially announced. The committee hired Furness to advise them, and later chose him to be the library's architect. Furness's earliest known drawing (1887) shows a plan and a massing of volumes close to the library as built‚Äîa stair tower separating vertical circulation from the reading room and stacks; a building featuring an apsidal north end with an arc of seminar rooms clustered around the base of the apse (like side chapels of a basilica).George E. Thomas, Frank Furness: Architecture in the Age of the Great Machines, (Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 2018). When the university changed the library's proposed site from 36th & Spruce Streets to 34th & Locust Streets, Furness essentially redrew the plan as a mirror image. Furness used a similar plan and massing for his own country house, \\"Idlewild,\\" with a U-shaped wrap-around porch taking the place of the arc of seminar rooms. As noted by architectural historian James F. O'Gorman: \\"For his own house in Media, [Furness] shrank the plan of the contemporary University Library, and erected over it a stone, brick, and shingle house.\\"James F. O'Gorman, The Architecture of Frank Furness, (Philadelphia Museum of Art, 1973), p. 64. Furness used a similar plan and massing for the eastern half of Edward Brooke II's house, although the addition of a conical roof turned its apse into a tower.East fa√ßade, from brookemansion.com File:LOC 15575v.jpgPreliminary plan for the University of Pennsylvania Library (1887) File:University of Pennsylvania Library 1904 Detroit Publishing Co.jpgUniversity of Pennsylvania Library (1888-90) File:Idlewild Media PA back side.JPG\\"Idlewild\\" (1888), Media, Pennsylvania File:East facade Brooke Mansion 7July2017.jpgBrooke Mansion (1887-88), east facade ===Exterior=== Furness designed the front (north) fa√ßade of Brooke's house with two projecting bays‚Äîan eastern semicircular apse/tower with a J-shaped wrap-around porch, and a western two-and-a-half-story gabled bay. The exterior's whole first story was faced in brownstone block, and its upper stories were clad in wood shingles. The porch's roof was carried on pyramidical brownstone-block piers with \\"eared\\" corbels. The formal entrance was between the projecting bays (from the porch) through a pair of doors with intricately-patterned inset leaded-glass windows, sidelights and a semi-oval fanlight. The carriage entrance was on the porch's east side, and featured a porte-coch√®re and steps leading to a side door with an inset beveled-glass window guarded by an intricate wrought iron grille.Porch and side door, from oldhouses.com Toward the south end, twin sets of French doors opened onto the porch. The house's eastern half featured a shingled Mansard roof with shed-roofed dormers on three sides, two of them enclosing four windows each. The tower featured twin paired windows on the second and third stories, the upper ones enclosed by conical-roofed dormers. The tower's conical roof and the conical-roofed dormers were crowned by (copper?) finials (now weathered to verdigris). Between the projecting bays, the second story was clad in brownstone, with a large lunette window over the front doors. The house's original western (now center) projecting bay featured large twin windows on the first story, and paired windows on the second and third stories. Its shingled front and sides curved outward in a skirt, and were carried on paired brownstone corbels. As a decorative effect, the shingles under its gable were cut to form concentric arcs. The house featured Furness's characteristic \\"upside-down\\" brick chimneys, that flared outward near the top.Ellen Zeiper, \\"Frank Furness: An Eclectic Architect's Chimney Designs,\\" American Art & Antiques, vol. 1, no. 3 (November‚ÄìDecember 1978), pp. 62‚Äì69.

The hall, billiard room, and dining room were paneled in coffered oak wainscoting, and their ceilings were circumscribed by oak beams, each in a different pattern. The beams of the round library's ceiling formed a compass rose. The grand stairway climbed along the hall's south wall, turned left to form a gallery over the carriage entrance, and turned again along the north wall before reaching the second floor. The hall was lighted by a row of four tall windows above the gallery, that also lighted the upper hall.Stairway, from alllehighvalleyhomes.com The second floor followed a similar plan as the first, with four large bedrooms opening onto an extended upper hall. A dressing room between each pair of bedrooms allowed for discrete access by servants. The third floor featured a central lobby, illuminated by a large frosted-glass skylight and surrounded by seven rooms. These included a round nursery (in the tower), a long southeast bedroom (with dressing room), servant rooms, and storage. One of the house's ingenious features was the windowless back staircase, that climbed from the basement kitchen to the third floor. Light from the skylight in the roof was able to reach the basement level. The back staircase \\"permit[ted] servants access to various sections of the house without having to pass through formal rooms.\\" Mrs. Brooke loved flowers, and the house was decorated with examples in wood, stone, glass and iron.

The contractor was Levi H. Focht, who had constructed the house five years earlier, and had constructed Furness's additions to St. Michael's Church nine years earlier. Acting as his own architect, Edward II added a third projecting bay to the front fa√ßade, turning the original western bay into a center bay and connecting all three bays with a wide terrace. The addition brought the kitchen out of the basement, and added a second set of back stairs and a rope-pulled elevator, operated using counterweights (like a dumbwaiter). \\"[T]he western section was constructed for food preparation, general storage, servant's quarters, and the like.\\" The expansion had minor effects on the first floor formal rooms‚Äîthe parlor's box window became a short hallway to the new addition; the old butler's pantry became a study (off the billiard room); and two of the dining room's doorways (and perhaps the double window) were moved. It had a larger effect on the second floor‚Äîthree of the four bedrooms were cut down in size: two to install bathrooms, and the third for a hallway to the new addition. On the exterior, the alterations required the moving of existing windows and the installation of new windows for the bathrooms. Through the expansion Edward II's large house became a mansion of nearly 14,000 square feet.301 Washington St, Birdsboro, PA, from Zillow. The 1890 Census listed five live-in servants in the household, but the number increased following the 1893 expansion. The mansion was illuminated by gaslight until the installation of electricity in 1896. Telephone service arrived in 1904. ===Carriage house=== Edward II's passion was horses, both racehorses and carriage horses.Matt Romanski, \\"Brooke Mansion Is a Monument to Bygone Era,\\" The Reading Eagle, December 24, 1978, pp. 12‚Äì13.

Lippincott Company, 1900), p. 511. and competed in the annual 3-day carriage marathon from New York City to Philadelphia. In 1898, Edward II designed and built an enormous 2-story carriage house (with elevator) southwest of the mansion.\\"Elegant Stable to be erected by Edward Brooke,\\" The Reading Eagle, October 8, 1898, p. 2. His collection grew to twenty-four carriages, and included \\"buggies, surreys, broughams, a pony cart and an Irish jaunting cart in which a person had to sit sideways.\\" \\"After a particular vehicle had been used, it was brought into the carriage house, thoroughly cleaned and then taken to the second floor on a hand-operated lift to be readied for the next ride.\\" Most of the carriages were sold to the National Park Service in 1941. The carriage house burned in the 1970s. The short hallway between the mansion's hall and dining room featured a special closet for Edward II's top hat, whip and tack. Coaching paintings and prints and equestrian bronzes decorated many of the rooms. ==20th century== Detail of the 1890 panoramic view of Birdsboro. \\"Brookewood,\\" George Brooke's mansion and stables are left, Edward Brooke II's mansion (prior to its 1893 expansion) is right.

Both the First and Second editions had incomplete card lists supplied by the manufacturer. The game was based on the Cold War between the U.S. and the U.S.S.R.. The game was considered \\"hellishly complex\\" and its rules were compared to miniature wargaming. Players used aircraft, anti-aircraft guns, amphibious vehicles, tanks, mine-fields, engineers, and about a dozen other special cards and abilities. Players first have to build a battlefield: Each starter comes with five Terrain cards, each with a modifier regarding specific types of Combatants. (Tanks don't do well in towns, but soldiers do.) Each turn, players draw a card, play a Supply card (either ammo or fuel), and brings troops, vehicles and Support cards (guns, gear) into play face down. Supply points limit the amount of equipment you can have in play. When you're feeling tough, you can flip some guys over and send them marching through a specific Terrain using a Maneuver card.

The graves contain the remains of citizens of the United Kingdom, India, Netherlands, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and Poland from World War I and World War II. 821 graves contain individuals from the army and 296 from the air force. The rest contain personnel from the navy and merchant navy as well as a nurse and a civilian. Some of the war graves belong to those from regiments such as: the King's Own Yorkshire Light Infantry, the 3rdQueen Alexandra's Own Gurkha Rifles, the Royal Northumberland Fusiliers, the Royal Engineers, the Gloucestershire Regiment, the Royal Artillery and the Burma Rifles. There are also special memorials for thirty-two service personnel whose remains could not be traced, including Maureen Grundy, a leading aircraftwoman in the Women's Auxiliary Air Force. Her Grave Registration Report by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission shows that while her ashes were deposited at St Martin's Church, Delhi, they could not be found later by Church authorities. Accordingly a special memorial in the form of a gravestone with her full service particulars was erected in commemoration. The youngest burials are four service personnel aged eighteen, while the oldest burial is Major Reginald Hamilton Richmond of the 5thRoyal Gurkha Rifles (Frontier Force). Three major generals are also buried at the memorial, Charles Sumner Lund Hertzberg of the Canadian Army, George Grant Tabuteau of the Royal Army Medical Corps and Thomas George Gordon Heywood. Hertzberg was commander of the Royal Canadian Engineering Corps as chief engineer and died at age fifty-seven after contracting smallpox on a special assignment in India, while Heywood died when the Royal Air Force transport plane he was in crashed at Allahabad in 1943.

Selvaskandan for Picture This Motions. The film, starring Raja Ganeshan, Kamala Sri Mohan, Darshan Dharmaraj, Gajan Kanesshan, Niranjani Shanmugaraja, Sathiyapriya Ratnasaamy along with King Ratnam in the lead roles, opened to positive reviews among the audience after the first day. The film also received praise from the critics for its satire and comedy storyline. Komaali Kings is considered one of the rarest and most important mass-budgeted films in Sri Lankan Tamil cinema in nearly about 40 years since the release of super hit Komaligal in 1976. Komaali Kings was one of the most awaited films in Sri Lankan cinema after its production was started back in 2016 with only 26 days of shooting procedure but there were delays due to unavoidable factors, and was finally released nationwide on 23 February 2018 after 2 years of delays. The film has both Sinhala and English subtitles. Recently this film won Best Tamil film of the year award from Sunsilk Derana film awards 2019. == Production == A team announced the filming process about a Tamil movie to be produced in Sri Lanka titled as \\"Komaali Kings\\" earlier in the year 2016, on 23 January. The team stated that Komaali Kings was an attempt to rekindle and re-establish nostalgic memories of the hay days of Sri Lankan Tamil Cinema mainly as the Sri Lankan Tamil cinema was demolished due to the Sri Lankan civil war which prevailed in Sri Lanka for 30 years. Initially, the director of the film wanted to prepare a script on a crime thriller film with the title, Nuni before changing his mindset to arrange script for a black comedy film. The trailer of the film was released in 2016 and the first look poster of the film was released by popular Indian director, K. S. Ravikumar.

Witnesses identified the gunman as a former student at the school. The shooter allegedly fled the scene on foot by blending with other students. A suspect, later identified as Nikolas Cruz, was arrested without incident about an hour later in nearby Coral Springs. He confessed to being the shooter, and he was charged with 17 counts of premeditated murder and 17 counts of attempted murder. Police and prosecutors have not offered a motive and are investigating \\"a pattern of disciplinary issues and unnerving behavior\\". The killing spree is the deadliest high school shooting in United States history, surpassing the Columbine High School massacre that killed 15, including the perpetrators, in Colorado in April 1999. The shooting came at a period of heightened public support for gun control that followed mass shootings in Las Vegas, Nevada and Sutherland Springs, Texas, in October and November 2017. Following the massacre, the anger and frustration of Parkland student survivors intensified towards the inaction of the Republican-dominated legislature on the wider issue of mass shootings and gun violence. The students founded Never Again MSD, an advocacy group that lobbies for legislative action on gun violence. On , Governor Rick Scott signed a bill that implemented new restrictions to Florida's gun laws and also allowed for the arming of teachers who were properly trained and the hiring of school resource officers. After the shooting, the Broward County Sheriff's Office received widespread criticism for its handling of the police response, with much of the criticism being directed at Sheriff Scott Israel for not addressing loopholes that allowed the shooter to legally purchase a firearm despite his lengthy record of threatening behavior. Israel's deputies were also criticized for staying outside the school and not immediately confronting the gunman. This led to the resignations of several police officers who responded to the scene, and Israel's suspension by new Governor Ron DeSantis. A commission appointed by then-Governor Scott to investigate the shooting condemned the police inaction and urged school districts across the state to adopt greater measures of security. == Shooting == BCSO deputy outside Building 12 during the shooting The shooting took place during the afternoon of , 2018, at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, an affluent suburb about northwest of Fort Lauderdale. The alleged shooter, former student Nikolas Cruz, was dropped off at the school by an Uber driver at 2:19 p.m., shortly before dismissal time. According to a police report, Cruz was carrying a rifle case and a backpack when he was spotted and recognized by a staff member who radioed a colleague that he was walking \\"purposefully\\" toward Building 12. The first staff member claimed that his training called for only reporting threats; his colleague hid in a closet. The shooter entered Building 12, a three-story structure containing 30 classrooms typically occupied by about 900 students and 30 teachers. Armed with a legally purchased AR-15 style semi-automatic rifle and multiple magazines, the shooter activated a fire alarm and began firing indiscriminately at students and teachers. The fire alarm caused confusion because there had been a fire drill earlier in the day. At about 2:21 p.m. the same staff member heard gunfire and activated a code red lockdown. An armed school resource officer of the Broward County Sheriff's Office was on campus when the shooting broke out, and remained outside between Building 12 and adjacent Building 7. Cruz during his arrest in Coral Springs The shooting lasted six minutes. On the first floor, the shooter fired in the hallway and into four classrooms, killing eleven people. He then went to the second floor, where he fired into two more classrooms but did not kill anyone. On the third floor, he shot and killed six people in the hallway. He also attempted but failed to shoot outside through the windows, which were hurricane-resistant. After he stopped shooting (possibly because his rifle jammed), it's claimed that the shooter dropped his rifle on the third floor of the building and left the scene by blending in with fleeing students. It is alleged that the shooter then walked to a fast- food restaurant (stopping at a mall to get a soda on the way) and lingered before leaving on foot at 3:01 p.m. At about 3:40 p.m., Cruz was stopped by police in the Wyndham Lakes neighborhood of Coral Springs, from the school and arrested as the suspected shooter. Cruz was then taken to a hospital emergency room with \\"labored breathing\\". After 40 minutes, Cruz was released back into police custody and booked into the Broward County Jail. School surveillance camera video was alleged to show Cruz as the shooter, and he was also recognized by eyewitnesses. While SWAT paramedics were inside the building, additional paramedics from the local Fire-Rescue department repeatedly requested to enter the building. These requests were denied by the Broward Sheriff's Office, even after the suspect was arrested. An interactive timeline of the events, beginning with when Cruz was alleged to have entered the school property, was compiled by the Sun-Sentinel and published on December 28, 2018. Entitled Unprepared and Overwhelmed, the report highlighted a myriad of shortcomings by school officials and first responders. == Victims == A banner created by a church to offer support for the survivors. Such banners offering love and support were requested by school officials and were hung all over the campus. Seventeen people were killed and seventeen people were wounded but survived their gunshot wounds. Three remained in critical condition the day after the shooting and one remained by the second day. Twelve victims died inside the building, three died just outside the building on school premises, and two died in the hospital. The fourteen students and three staff members killed were: * Alyssa Alhadeff, 14 * Scott Beigel, 35 * Martin Duque, 14 * Nicholas Dworet, 17 * Aaron Feis, 37 * Jaime Guttenberg, 14 * Chris Hixon, 49 * Luke Hoyer, 15 * Cara Loughran, 14 * Gina Montalto, 14 * Joaquin Oliver, 17 * Alaina Petty, 14 * Meadow Pollack, 18 * Helena Ramsay, 17 * Alex Schachter, 14 * Carmen Schentrup, 16 * Peter Wang, 15 Geography teacher Scott Beigel was killed after he unlocked a classroom for students to enter and hide from the gunman. Aaron Feis, an assistant football coach and security guard, was killed as he shielded two students. Chris Hixon, the school's athletic director, was killed as he ran toward the sound of the gunfire and tried to help fleeing students. Student Peter Wang was last seen in his Junior Reserve Officers' Training Corps (JROTC) uniform, holding doors open so others could get out more quickly; Wang was unable to flee with the students when Cruz appeared and fatally shot him. Commentators commended his actions and described him as a hero. A White House petition was circulated, calling for him to be buried with full military honors. At their respective funerals, Wang, Alaina Petty, and Martin Duque were all posthumously honored by the U.S. Army with the ROTC Medal for Heroism, and Wang was buried in his JROTC Blues uniform. On , he was given a rare posthumous admission to the United States Military Academy. Alyssa Alhadeff was the captain of the Parkland Soccer Club. On , 2018‚Äînearly three weeks after the shooting‚Äîshe was honored by the United States women's national soccer team prior to a game in Orlando. Her teammates and family were invited to the game and presented with official jerseys that featured her name. Meadow Pollack was a senior who was shot four times. As the shooter fired into other classrooms, Pollack crawled to a classroom door but was unable to get inside. Cara Loughran, a freshman, was alongside Pollack, and Pollack covered Loughran in an attempt to shield her from the bullets. The shooter returned to the classroom and located Pollack and Loughran, discharging his weapon five more times and killing both girls. Sheriff Israel visits victim Anthony Borges. The last victim to remain hospitalized, Anthony Borges, was discharged on . Dubbed \\"the real Iron Man\\", Borges was shot five times after he used his body to barricade the door of a classroom where twenty students were inside. Upon his release, Borges issued a statement that criticized the actions of Broward Sheriff's deputies, Sheriff Scott Israel, and School Superintendent Robert Runcie. His family has filed notice of its intent to sue the school district for personal injury to cover costs related to his recovery. Several survivors of the shooting, teachers and students alike, have struggled with survivor's guilt and other symptoms of post- traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). On March 17, 2019, thirteen months after the shooting, a 19-year-old woman who survived and who had lost her friend Meadow Pollack the year before, committed suicide after struggling to attend college. She was terrified of being in a classroom and also had been treated for survivor's guilt and PTSD. Less than a week later, a 16-year old boy who had survived the shooting died of an apparent suicide. == Suspect == Mugshot of Nikolas CruzNikolas Jacob Cruz was born September 24, 1998 in Margate, Florida and was adopted at birth by Lynda and Roger Cruz. Both his adoptive parents died, Roger at age 67 in 2004, and Lynda at age 68 in November 2017, leaving Cruz orphaned three months before the shooting. Since his mother's death, he had been living with relatives and friends. At the time of the shooting, he was enrolled in a GED program and employed at a local dollar store. Cruz was a member of the Junior Reserve Officers' Training Corps (JROTC) and had received multiple awards \\"including academic achievement for maintaining an A grade in JROTC and Bs in other subjects\\", according to CNN. He was also a member of his school's varsity air rifle team. Cruz had behavioral issues since middle school, but a Washington Post writer said the student was \\"entrenched in the process for getting students help rather than referring them to law enforcement.\\" He was transferred between schools six times in three years in an effort to deal with these problems. In 2014, he was transferred to a school for children with emotional or learning disabilities. There were reports that he made threats against other students. He returned to Stoneman Douglas High School two years later but was banished in 2017 for disciplinary reasons. As he could not be expelled from the Broward County School system completely, he was transferred to alternate placement. The school administration had circulated an email to teachers, warning that Cruz had made threats against other students. The school banned him from wearing a backpack on campus. Psychiatrists recommended an involuntary admission of Cruz to a residential treatment facility, starting in 2013. The Florida Department of Children and Families investigated him in September 2016 for Snapchat posts in which he cut both his arms and said he planned to buy a gun. At this time, a school resource officer suggested he undergo an involuntary psychiatric examination under the provisions of the Baker Act. Two guidance counselors agreed, but a mental institution did not. State investigators reported he had depression, autism, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). In their assessment, they concluded he was \\"at low risk of harming himself or others\\". He had previously received mental health treatment, but had not received treatment in the year leading up to the shooting. Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel described Cruz's online profiles and accounts as \\"very, very disturbing\\". They contained pictures and posts of him with a variety of weapons, including long knives, a shotgun, a pistol, and a BB gun. Police said that he held \\"extremist\\" views; social media accounts that were thought to be linked to him contained anti-black and anti-Muslim slurs. YouTube comments linked to him include \\"I wanna die Fighting killing shit ton of people\\", threats against police officers and \\"antifa,\\" and intent to mimic the University of Texas tower shooting. In February 2017, Cruz legally purchased an AR-15 style semi-automatic rifle from a Coral Springs gun store, after having passed the required background check. Previous to the purchase he had similarly obtained several other firearms, including at least one shot gun and several other rifles. At the time of the shooting, in Florida, it was legal for people as young as 18 to purchase guns from federally licensed dealers, including the assault style rifle allegedly used in the shooting. The minimum age requirement has since been raised to 21. Items recovered by police at the scene included gun magazines with swastikas carved in them. One student claimed that Cruz had drawn a swastika and the words \\"I hate niggers\\" on his backpack. CNN reported that Cruz was in a private Instagram group chat where he expressed racist, homophobic, antisemitic, and anti-immigrant (xenophobic) views. He said he wanted to kill gay people and Mexicans, and talked about keeping black people in chains. He said he hated black people \\"simply because they were black,\\" and Jewish people because he believed \\"they wanted to destroy the world.\\" He also referred to white women who engaged in interracial relationships as traitors. A former classmate said Cruz had anger management issues and often joked about guns and gun violence, which included threats of shooting up establishments. The brother of a 2016 graduate described him as \\"super stressed out all the time and talked about guns a lot and tried to hide his face\\". A student who was enrolled at the school at the time of the shooting said, \\"I think everyone had in their minds if anybody was going to do it, it was going to be him.\\" A classmate who was assigned to work with him in sophomore year said, \\"He told me how he got kicked out of two private schools. He was held back twice. He had aspirations to join the military. He enjoyed hunting.\\" A student's mother said that he also bragged about killing animals. A neighbor said his mother would call the police over to the house to try to talk some sense into him. === Warnings to law enforcement === Sheriff Scott Israel said that his office received 23 calls about Cruz during the previous decade, but this figure is in dispute. CNN used a public records request to obtain a sheriff's office log, which showed that from 2008 to 2017, at least 45 calls were made in reference to Cruz, his brother, or the family home. On , 2016, the calls used an anonymous tip that Cruz had threatened to shoot up the school, and a tip on , 2017, that he might be a \\"school shooter in the making\\" and that he collected knives and guns. On , 2016, a peer counselor notified the school resource officer of his suicide attempt and intent to buy a gun; the school indicated it would do a \\"threat assessment\\". In September 2016, three people‚Äîa sheriff's deputy who worked as a resource officer at Stoneman Douglas, and two of the school's counselors‚Äîstated that Cruz should be committed for mental evaluation. On , 2017, a person with the username \\"nikolas cruz\\" posted a comment to a YouTube video that read, \\"Im going to be a professional school shooter\\". The person who uploaded the video to YouTube reported the comment to the FBI. According to agent Robert Lasky, the agency conducted database reviews but was unable to track down the individual who made the threatening comment. On , 2018, more than a month before the shooting, the FBI received a tip on its Public Access Line from a person who was close to Cruz. On , two days after the shooting, the agency released a statement that detailed this information. According to the statement, \\"The caller provided information about Cruz's gun ownership, desire to kill people, erratic behavior, and disturbing social media posts, as well as the potential of him conducting a school shooting.\\" After conducting an investigation, the FBI said the tip line did not follow protocol when the information was not forwarded to the Miami Field Office, where investigative steps would have been taken. The FBI opened a probe into the tip line's operations. The lack of response by Israel and other members of the Broward County Sheriff's Office to the numerous red flags and warnings about Cruz has been the subject of much scrutiny. In the days following the shooting, calls for Israel's resignation intensified as more information that alluded to the department's inaction was revealed. Since the shooting, Israel has declined to resign and refused to take responsibility for his role in failing to stop Cruz before the mass shooting took place. In an interview with CNN, Israel described his leadership at the department as \\"amazing\\", a claim that was widely mocked and criticized. === Efforts to seek help === The school district conducted an assessment of the handling of Cruz. According to their redacted report, which was reviewed in August 2018 by The New York Times, The Daily Beast, and other media, a year before the shooting Cruz had sought help from education specialists, as his grades at Stoneman Douglas were declining. He was an eighteen-year-old junior, and met with the specialists with his mother. The specialists recommended that he transfer to another school, Cross Creek in Pompano Beach, where he had done well before. But he wanted to graduate with his class at Stoneman Douglas, and rejected this option, as an adult. He was advised that if he stayed, he would no longer be able to access special education services, but this was incorrect. A few months later, he withdrew because of failing grades. After that, Cruz requested to go to Cross Creek, but he was told a new assessment was needed, delaying action. == Legal proceedings == Cruz's initial arraignment (3:02) At his initial arraignment the day after the shootings, Cruz was charged with 17 counts of premeditated murder and held without bond. If convicted of first degree murder, he faces either the death penalty (execution by lethal injection) or life without parole. According to an affidavit by the sheriff's office, Cruz confessed to the shooting. It was also claimed Cruz told officers that he brought additional loaded magazines hidden in a backpack. Cruz was placed on suicide watch in an isolation cell (solitary confinement) after the arraignment. Lead defense counsel Gordon Weekes asked Judge Elizabeth Scherer to recuse herself, claiming that her previous comments and rulings showed favoritism toward the prosecution, which would prevent Cruz from receiving a fair trial. She disagreed and declined the request on . On , a grand jury indicted Cruz on 34 charges: 17 counts of first-degree murder and 17 counts of attempted first-degree murder. He was arraigned on , and the prosecution filed notice of their intent to seek the death penalty. They said they can prove five of the aggravating factors that qualify a murder for the death penalty in Florida. Cruz declined to enter a plea, so Judge Scherer entered \\"not guilty\\" on his behalf. The defense had earlier offered a guilty plea if the death penalty were taken off the table, and reiterated it immediately before it was refused. During the week of April 8‚Äì12, 2018, Broward Circuit Judge Elizabeth Scherer included a three-page letter from a Minnesotan into the court record of the case. The letter was addressed to the judge and claimed that research into Cruz's past led the writer to believe that Cruz suffered from a developmental disability and that he was \\"fearful of other people and was threatened by bullies.\\" The letter ended by claiming that Cruz appeared to be consumed by sadness and depression. The same week, a hearing was held to determine if Cruz was entitled to a public defender. His attorney, court-appointed public defender Howard Finkelstein, asked the court to wait until the probate case involving Cruz's late mother's estate was concluded and Cruz's net worth could be determined, as Cruz would have only been entitled to a public defender had he been unable to afford a private attorney. On April 24, 2019, a determination was made that Cruz and his half- brother Zachary would share the proceeds of a MetLife insurance policy valued at $864,929. This would make Cruz ineligible for representation by the public defender's office, and as such, the office asked to be removed from his case on that date. Meanwhile, with respect to Cruz's confession, Judge Scherer ruled on July 26, 2018 that it would be released to the public with certain details redacted. On August 3, Judge Scherer additionally ruled that the Broward school district's report on Cruz would be released to the public. Some portions of the report were redacted to protect Cruz's privacy rights. Cruz's confession was released on August 6. On August 8, a video of Cruz's confession filmed by the Broward County Sheriff's Office was published by TMZ. Cruz can be heard crying near the end of the video, and saying \\"kill me\\" to the camera. According to the Broward County Sheriff's Office, Cruz attacked a jail officer on the night of November 13, 2018. The following day, he was charged with aggravated assault on an officer, battery on an officer and use of an \\"electric or chemical weapon against an officer.\\" The officer who was allegedly attacked by Cruz had asked him to \\"not drag his sandals on the ground\\" while he was walking in the jail's dayroom. It was claimed Cruz responded by \\"displaying his middle finger\\" and striking the officer in the face. He also grabbed the stun gun out of the deputy's holster. The weapon discharged during the brawl before the deputy regained control. Cruz appeared at an initial hearing on the assault charges, where bail was set at $200,000. Cruz's trial, initially scheduled to begin on January 27, 2020, was originally delayed until mid-year to allow his lawyers more time to build their case. , the case has been delayed indefinitely due to restraints caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. == Aftermath == On May 30, 2018, prosecutors released three videos that they claimed Cruz had recorded on his cellphone before the shooting. In the videos, Cruz appears to describe his personal feelings, his enthusiasm and plan for the shooting, his hatred of people, and how it will make him notorious. === School response === The school district provided grief counseling to students and their families. Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi said that the fees of funerals and counseling would be paid for by the state. On , police presence was increased at schools in at least two counties in Florida in response to the shooting. The building where the shooting took place was demolished. On , two weeks after the shooting, Stoneman Douglas reopened to students amid a heavy police presence. School principal Ty Thompson emphasized that the first week back would be focused on healing, with classes ending at 11:40 a.m. through . He tweeted \\" Remember our focus is on emotional readiness and comfort not curriculum: so there is no need for backpacks. Come ready to start the healing process and #RECLAIMTHENEST\\". Extra counseling and emotional support dogs were provided to students upon their return. In early April, the school implemented several new safety rules and regulations. The changes included fewer entrances, law enforcement officers at each entrance, identification badges for students and staff, and the requirement that all book bags must be clear plastic. The use of metal detectors was under consideration. Several students criticized the new safety measures as ineffective and intrusive. On November 30, 2018, the Sun-Sentinel reported that Broward County Public Schools, which runs Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, had spent about $185,000 attempting to obscure its role in not preventing the massacre. The district also spent an undisclosed sum on legal opposition to the releasing of records related to the school's treatment of Nikolas Cruz while he was a student, and the school security procedures. A company named CEN received a $60,000 payment to review Cruz's school records and to investigate if the Broward County Public Schools followed the law in its handling of Cruz as a troubled student. The final report omitted various details about the instability of Cruz. ==== Graduation ceremony ==== The school held its graduation ceremony on June 3, 2018, and diplomas were presented to the families of Nicholas Dworet, Joaquin Oliver, Meadow Pollack, and Carmen Schentrup, four students who were killed in the attack. Stoneman Douglas principal Ty Thompson began by dedicating the ceremony to \\"those not with us\\". Many graduates wore sashes that were emblazoned with #MSDStrong, or decorated their caps with references to the Never Again movement, while some dedicated their caps to their late classmates. Families of the victims also made statements; the mother of Joaquin Oliver accepted his diploma wearing a shirt saying \\"This should be my son\\". Talk show host Jimmy Fallon made a surprise appearance and gave a commencement speech to the graduating class, thanking them for their courage and bravery. ==== First-year anniversary ==== On the first anniversary of the shooting, the school opted to establish a voluntary attendance day. It organized a day of community service with early dismissal, so that the school was closed at the time of the attack. A police line was created to shelter those students who chose to attend. The large, planned project for the day was to replace the memorial with a permanent memorial garden. A planned moment of silence at 10:17 AM ET was held, with support provided from grief counselors and therapy dogs. An interfaith memorial service was planned in a separate location. === Officer inactivity === School resource officer (SRO) Scot Peterson, who was armed, on-site and in uniform as a Broward Sheriff's Office deputy, was accused of remaining outside Building 12 during the shooting. Eight days after the attack, he was suspended without pay by Sheriff Israel, and he immediately retired. Sheriff Israel said \\"Scot Peterson was absolutely on campus for this entire event,\\" and that he should have \\"gone in, addressed the killer, [and] killed the killer\\". In June 2019, following an investigation that included interviews with 184 witnesses, Peterson was arrested and then bonded out for the crime of failing to protect the students during the shooting. He faces 11 charges of neglect of a child, as well as culpable negligence and perjury. Peterson pleaded not guilty and has filed a motion to have all charges dropped. A statement released by Peterson's lawyer before he was charged said that Peterson believed the shooting was happening outside the building. According to the lawyer, Peterson claimed he told this to the first Coral Springs police officer who arrived on scene. The statement also pointed to radio transmissions that indicated a gunshot victim near the football field. The Miami Herald transcribed radio dispatches that Peterson said at 2:23 during the shooting, \\"Be advised we have possible, could be firecrackers. I think we have shots fired, possible shots fired ‚Äî1200 building\\". Seconds later, Peterson radioed: \\"We're talking about the 1200 building it's going to be the building off Holmberg Road Get the school locked down, gentlemen!\\" At 2:25, he radioed that \\"We also heard it's by, inside the 1200\\". At an unspecified time, Peterson called for police to ensure that \\"no one comes inside the school\\". At 2:27, at Building 12, he radioed, \\"Stay at least 500 feet away at this point.\\" At an unspecified time, Peterson ordered: \\"Do not approach the 12 or 1300 building, stay at least 500 feet away\\". On , the sheriff's office released video footage in compliance with a court order. The video was captured by school surveillance cameras and showed some of Peterson's movements during the shooting. Unnamed sources told CNN that Coral Springs police arrived at the scene and saw three Broward deputies behind their vehicles with pistols drawn. Broward Sheriff's Office captain Jan Jordan ordered deputies to form a perimeter instead of immediately confronting the shooter; this tactic was contrary to their training regarding active shooters. Based on time stamps of the police logs, the order was given some time after the shooting had stopped. Jordan was widely criticized for her actions, and she resigned, citing personal reasons, nine months after the shooting. Sheriff Israel said that Coral Springs officers were the first to enter the building, about four minutes after Cruz had surreptitiously left the school. Due to a tape delay in viewing surveillance footage, officers believed that Cruz was still in the building. there were three investigations into the timeline of police response. President Donald Trump criticized the officers who failed to enter the building during the shooting. On , he said that he believed he would have entered \\"even if I didn't have a weapon, and I think most of the people in this room would have done that, too.\\" His statement was mocked by some late night show hosts, who noted that Trump had avoided the military draft. Some survivors criticized Trump for his comments; for instance, survivor and activist David Hogg said that Trump was bragging and talking about himself in response to a tragedy that did not concern him. === Political reaction === Broward Health North Medical Center, two days after the shooting. President Trump offered his prayers and condolences to the victims' families, writing, \\"no child, teacher or anyone else should ever feel unsafe in an American school\\". In a televised address, he mentioned school safety and mental health issues. Florida Governor Rick Scott ordered that flags at state buildings be flown at half-staff, and Trump later ordered flags be flown at half-staff for the entire country. Two days after the shooting, Trump and the first lady Melania visited Broward Health North, a hospital where eight of the shooting victims were admitted. They met with two victims and Trump praised doctors and law enforcement officials for their responses to the attack. On , Trump met with students and others for a \\"listening session\\" at the White House. He suggested arming up to 20% of the teachers to stop \\"maniacs\\" from attacking students. The following day, he called a \\"gun free\\" school a \\"magnet\\" for criminals and tweeted, \\"Highly trained, gun adept, teachers/coaches would solve the problem instantly, before police arrive.\\" BBC News characterized Republican politicians' reactions as focusing on mental health issues while dodging debate on gun control, with the reasoning that it was either \\"too political or too soon\\". Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan said that this was the time to \\"step back and count our blessings\\" instead of \\"taking sides and fighting each other politically\\". Republican Florida Senator Marco Rubio said that \\"most\\" proposals on stricter gun laws \\"would not have prevented\\" this shooting nor \\"any of those in recent history\\" and that lawmakers should take action with \\"focus on the violence part\\" alongside guns. Republican Kentucky Governor Matt Bevin declared that the country should re- evaluate \\"the things being put in the hands of our young people\\", specifically \\"quote-unquote video games\\" that \\"have desensitized people to the value of human life\\". Republican Senator Pat Roberts of Kansas said he supported age restrictions on the ownership of AR-15 style rifles, saying \\"Certainly nobody under 21 should have an AR-15.\\" Republican Senator from Oklahoma James Lankford said on NBC News' Meet the Press he was open to requiring more comprehensive background checks for firearm purchases, saying \\"The problem is not owning an AR-15, it's the person who owns it.\\" Republican governor of Ohio John Kasich called for restrictions on the sales of AR-15 style rifles, saying on CNN \\"if all of a sudden, you couldn't buy an AR-15, what would you lose? Would you feel as though your Second Amendment rights would be eroded because you couldn't buy a God-darn AR-15?\\" Republican Representative Brian Mast from Florida, a former resident of Parkland and an Army veteran, wrote in an op ed in The New York Times that he supported a ban on the sale of civilian versions of military rifles, writing: > Most nights in Afghanistan, I wielded an M4 carbine. My rifle was very > similar to the AR-15-style semiautomatic weapon used to kill students, > teachers and a coach I knew at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in > Parkland, Fla., where I once lived...I cannot support the primary weapon I > used to defend our people being used to kill children I swore to defend. The > AR-15 is an excellent platform for recreational shooters to learn to be > outstanding marksmen. Unfortunately, it is also an excellent platform for > those who wish to kill the innocent. Democratic Senator from Florida Bill Nelson said \\"I have hunted all my life. But an AR-15 is not for hunting. It's for killing.\\" Al Hoffman Jr., a Republican donor in Florida, pledged that he would no longer fund legislative groups or candidates who were not actively working to ban sales of military- style assault weapons to civilians. He said, \\"For how many years now have we been doing this ‚Äì having these experiences of terrorism, mass killings ‚Äì and how many years has it been that nothing's been done?\\" Sheriff Israel called on lawmakers to amend the Baker Act to allow police to detain and hospitalize people who make disturbing posts‚Äînot just clear threats‚Äîon social media. \\"I'm talking about being around bombs, possibly talking about 'I want to be a serial killer', talking about taking people's lives\\", he said. \\"Just taking a picture with a gun or a knife or a weapon ‚Äì that in and of itself is clearly not even remotely something that we're concerned about.\\" === Gun control debate === Students protest gun violence outside the White House in Washington, D.C., Many student survivors criticized the response from politicians and asked them not to offer condolences but to take action to prevent more students from being killed in school shootings. These students have demanded stricter gun control measures. Survivor Emma Gonz√°lez was noted for her speech that rebuked thoughts and prayers from politicians. She later helped lead a protest movement against gun violence in the United States. Broward County Schools Superintendent Rob Runcie said, \\"now is the time to have a real conversation about gun control legislation\\". Lori Alhadeff, whose daughter was killed in the shooting, implored Trump to do something to improve school safety. In the aftermath of the shooting, some of the student survivors organized a group called Never Again MSD. The group was created on social media with the hashtag #NeverAgain, activism inspired in part by the ground broken by the #MeToo movement and the 2018 Women's March. The group demanded legislative action to prevent similar shootings, and has condemned lawmakers who received political contributions from the National Rifle Association. The group held a rally on in Fort Lauderdale that was attended by hundreds of supporters. Since the shooting, several more rallies have been planned to take place with the focus on legislative action. The Women's March Network organized a school walkout that took place on . A series of demonstrations called \\"March for Our Lives\\" on included a march in Washington, D.C. On , the anniversary of the Columbine High School massacre, all-day walkouts were planned for teacher groups by educators Diane Ravitch and David Berliner, as well as student groups. On , dozens of Stoneman Douglas High School students went to the state Capitol in Tallahassee and watched as the Florida House of Representatives rejected a bill that would have banned some guns characterized as assault weapons. Students strongly criticized the vote. The bill's sponsor, Carlos Guillermo Smith, highlighted the legislature's failure to respond to the use of an assault weapon in the mass shooting at Stoneman Douglas High School, while passing a bill to declare that pornography is a public health risk. In mid-March, Lori Alhadeff announced her own nonprofit organization, Make Schools Safe, which will be mostly focusing on school campus security. In May 2018, Cameron Kasky's father registered a super PAC, Families vs Assault Rifles PAC (FAMSVARPAC), with intentions of going \\"up against NRA candidates in every meaningful race in the country\\". ==== State law ==== In March 2018, the Florida Legislature passed a bill titled the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School Public Safety Act. It raised the minimum age for buying rifles to 21, established waiting periods and background checks, provided a program for the arming of some school employees and hiring of school police, banned bump stocks, and barred some potentially violent or mentally unhealthy people arrested under certain laws from possessing guns. In all, it allocated around . Rick Scott signed the bill into law on . That same day, the NRA challenged the law by filing a lawsuit alleging that the ban on gun sales to people under 21 is unconstitutional because it violates the rights that the Second and Fourteenth Amendments confer to 18- to 21-year-olds, who are classified as adults. ==== Federal law ==== On February 20, 2018, Trump directed the Department of Justice to issue regulations to ban bump stocks. On , the STOP School Violence Act was signed into law as part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018, which increases funding for metal detectors, security training, and similar safety measures. Lawmakers made it clear it was in response to the shooting and the public outcry. Some students from the Stoneman Douglas High School, who were active in calling for stricter gun control (not just safety measures), said the measure was passed because lawmakers \\"pass something very easy and simple that everyone can get behind. But that's because it doesn't do anything.\\" ====Boycott of NRA and responses from businesses==== Following the shooting, people boycotted the U.S. gun rights advocacy group National Rifle Association (NRA) and its business affiliates. Many companies responded to the shooting by changing some of their business dealings and practices.Lin, Tom C. W., Incorporating Social Activism (December 1, 2018). 98 Boston University Law Review 1535 (2018) Calls for companies to sever their ties to the NRA were heeded when several companies terminated their business relationships with the NRA. Major gun sellers such as Dick's, Walmart, and Fred Meyer voluntarily raised the age requirement on gun purchases from 18 to 21. The NRA challenged the new age requirement in court. Other businesses like Bank of America and Citibank also ended some of their dealings with certain gun manufacturers and vendors. === Lawsuit === On May 23, 2018, the parents of victims Jaime Guttenberg and Alex Schachter sued firearm manufacturer American Outdoor Brands Corporation, formerly known as Smith & Wesson, the manufacturer of the rifle used by Cruz, and distributor Sunrise Tactical Supply, the retailer who sold Cruz the rifle, claiming damages due to \\"the defendant's complicity in the entirely foreseeable, deadly use of the assault-style weapons that they place on the market.\\" Fifteen survivors sued the county, sheriff and school officials for failing to protect them contending that the government's inadequate response to the shooting violated their Fourteenth Amendment right to due process. This lawsuit was dismissed in December 2018, with the judge citing prior case law in ruling that the government did not have a duty to protect the defendants from the actions of the shooter. === Victims' funds === In the aftermath of the shooting, more than was raised for the victims as of April 2018. Two other funds, Florida's Crime Victims Compensation Fund, which pays for medical and funeral expenses, and the National Compassion Fund, which pays for pain and suffering, are also available to help the victims of the Parkland shooting. === Conspiracy theories, disinformation, and harassment === Student David Hogg was subjected to widespread false allegations of being a crisis actor. Gun rights conspiracy theories circulated in the wake of the shooting. The speculation included false claims that the shooting did not happen or was staged by \\"crisis actors\\". One such claim was made by Benjamin A. Kelly, a district secretary for Republican State Representative Shawn Harrison, who sent an email to the Tampa Bay Times incorrectly stating that the children in the picture were not students at the school. As a result of the backlash, Kelly was fired hours later. Former Republican congressman and CNN contributor Jack Kingston suggested student demonstrators were paid by billionaire George Soros or were supported by members of Antifa. A video with a description espousing a conspiracy theory that student David Hogg was a \\"crisis actor\\" reached the top of YouTube's trending page before it was removed by the company.https://www.wired.com/story/youtube-will-link-directly-to-wikipedia- to-fight-conspiracies/ As the shooting took place, a teacher directed Hogg and several other students to hide in a closet. Hogg, who worked on the school's TV station, then filmed student reactions to the shooting in an effort to document the event. The Alliance for Securing Democracy alleged that Russia- linked accounts on Twitter and other platforms used the shooting's aftermath to inflame tensions and divide Americans by posting loaded comments that oppose gun control. Other Russia-linked accounts labeled the shooting a false flag operation that the U.S. government would exploit to seize guns from citizens. Hundreds of Russian bots are also suspected of coming to the defense of Laura Ingraham on Twitter following the boycott of her show, The Ingraham Angle that resulted from her public ridicule of Hogg. The conspiracy theories about survivors like Hogg and Gonz√°lez were named PolitiFact's 2018 Lie of the Year. Some of the survivors of the massacre and their relatives were targeted by online harassment that included death threats. Cameron Kasky wrote on Twitter that he was quitting Facebook for the time being, because the death threats from \\"NRA cultists\\" were slightly more graphic on a service without a character limit. == See also == * Assault weapons legislation in the United States * Extreme Risk Protection Order * Federal Assault Weapons Ban * Gun politics in the United States * List of attacks related to secondary schools * List of disasters in the United States by death toll * List of rampage killers (school massacres) * List of school shootings in the United States * Santa Fe High School shooting similar school shooting in Texas in May 2018 == Notes == == References == == External links == * \\"Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School Public Safety Commission.\\" Florida Department of Law Enforcement. * (2:11) * (26:46) * (27:45) * Draft report of the incident from the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School Public Safety Commission Category:2018 crimes in Florida Category:2018 mass shootings in the United States Category:Articles containing video clips Category:Broward County, Florida Category:Deaths by firearm in Florida Category:February 2018 crimes Category:February 2018 events in the United States Category:Gun politics in the United States Category:High school killings in the United States Category:High school shootings in the United States Category:Mass shootings in Florida Category:Mass shootings in the United States Category:Massacres in the United States Category:School massacres in the United States ","title":"Stoneman Douglas High School shooting"},{"id":"56589498","text":"Carlos Enrique Rubio y Mart√≠nez de Ubago is a Dominican penalist lawyer, former intelligence agent, YouTuber, instagrammer, and columnist, who is exiled in the United States.

Completed and dedicated in 1968, the library houses special collections materials including rare books, maps, archives, and photographs. The library is open to members of the public and is not limited to students and faculty members at KU. ==History== In 1949, Kenneth and Helen Spencer established a foundation in Kansas City for charitable giving in the region. Over the course of thirty years, the Foundation donated millions of dollars to universities, museums, and other cultural institutions in the Kansas City area and across the Midwest. Helen became president and director of the foundation following Kenneth's death in 1960 (she held these positions until the dissolution of the foundation in 1979). Shortly after Kenneth Spencer's death in 1960, Helen was approached about donating her husband's personal papers and business records to the University of Kansas. She agreed, and by October 1964, attention turned to how and where the materials would be housed as a special memorial library. KU's Watson Library was deemed unsuitable, as the facility's lack of space already hindered librarians' efforts to process and make available special collections materials. \\"Upon reflecting on this,\\" Helen later recalled, \\"and knowing that a university gains prominence through its Graduate College, I was inspired to give this graduate research library.\\" Helen was also inspired to establish the library so as to help combat the exodus of scholars from the Lawrence area, writing, \\"Kenneth and I had so often observed and regretted the loss of talented native Kansans to other larger eastern and western graduate schools because most of them found employment in those areas and never returned to the Middle West.\\". In January 1966, Helen donated funds to the University of Kansas for the construction of a library in honor of her late husband Kenneth. Helen's gift was, at the time, the largest single gift ever given to KU or to any institution in Kansas. When the gift was announced, Chancellor W. Clarke Wescoe declared that the library \\"will stand as a living memorial not only to an outstanding man and his equally distinguished wife but to the pursuit of learning that holds so much promise for the future and to the spirit of philanthropy which holds out for the University of Kansas the promise of future greatness.\\". Construction of the library began in January 1967. The library was dedicated on November 8, 1968, and it officially opened a month later. More than 150,000 books and 250,000 manuscripts were moved from Watson Library to Spencer, allowing KU to bring together previously scattered special collections as well as grow the collections and establish new services. ==Building== The Kenneth Spencer Research Library encompasses 100,000 square feet and is four-stories tall. The building was designed by the Tanner & Linscott architect Robert F. Jenks and built by B.A. Green Construction Co., which was based out of Lawrence. According to Alexandra Mason, a librarian who worked at the library, the structure was created \\"specifically to meet the needs of rare books, manuscripts, archives, and their users\\".Mason (1994), p. 9. In mid-to-late 2017, the library renovated its North Gallery. ==Collections== The Kenneth Spencer Research Library is home to collections in many subject areas: * University Archives: The University Archives, which were established in 1969 to serve as the official collection of the university, focus on preserving all documents pertaining to the history of KU. The collection comprises over 25,000 boxes of \\"papers, correspondence, reports, publications, scrapbooks, and student records along with more than one million photographs and thousands of reels of movie film, video, and audio recordings.\\" * Kansas Collection: The Kansas Collection dates back to 1891, when the university's first librarian, Carrie Watson, purchased 100 volumes of Kansas history from the Baldwin City minister J. W. D. Anderson.Helyar (1994), p. 52. Today, the collection focuses mostly on the history of Kansas and the region from the territorial period of the 1850s to the present. The emphasis of the collection is documenting Kansans‚Äô everyday lives and experiences, which are revealed through personal and family letters, diaries, scrapbooks, writings, newspaper clippings, and photographs. Other records of businesses, churches, schools, and organizations provide evidence of community history and social life. * African American Experience Collection: Since the 1980s, the Kenneth Spencer Research Library strives to document the history and contributions of African Americans in Kansas and the Midwest region. Staff members partner with African American communities around the state to ensure that their history is preserved and available for study. Significant collections of personal and family papers, as well as records of organizations, churches and businesses, attesting to this rich heritage have been acquired and made available for research. * Wilcox Collection: Established in 1965 by Laird Wilcox, the Wilcox Collection of Contemporary Political Movements is one of the biggest collections of extremist left- and right-wing political literature in the United States. According to the University itself, the collection includes thousands of \\"pamphlets, books, newsletters, audio recordings, and political ephemera such as bumper stickers, posters, flyers, organizational membership mailings, [and] book catalogs, relating to some 10,000 organizations at the fringes of the political spectrum.\\" * Special Collections: Spencer's Special Collections consist of rare books and manuscripts from around the world. Significant collections include holdings in Irish, Latin American, ornithological, New American poetry, science fiction, and 18th century materials, as well as medieval manuscripts and fragments. *The Gerritsen Collection includes over 4,700 books, pamphlets and periodicals collected by Dutch physician and feminist Aletta Jacobs and was purchased by the university in 1954. It is a valuable reference for women's studies containing works in fifteen languages, spanning the period from the 16th to the 20th centuries. Though it includes a large collection of material related to women's suffrage, as well as anti- suffrage, other areas of focus are women's education, employment, legal status, prostitution, as well as biographical and literary works by and about women. ===Exhibitions=== The library's exhibit spaces include the North Gallery, which, among other things, showcases two stories of glass-enclosed book stacks and a permanent exhibit featuring a snapshot of Spencer's distinctive collections. Spencer also hosts rotating exhibits throughout the year. ==Footnotes== ===Bibliography=== * * * ==External links== * The official website of the Kenneth Spencer Research Library Category:1968 establishments in Kansas Category:Libraries in Kansas Category:University and college academic libraries in the United States Category:University of Kansas campus ","title":"Kenneth Spencer Research Library"},{"id":"56589541","text":"The Last Man Who Knew Everything (2006), written by Andrew Robinson, is a biography of the British polymath Thomas Young (1773‚Äì1829).

They were members of the original Indoor Football League founded in 1999 and began play in 2000. They competed in the Southern Division of the Eastern Conference and played their home games at the Cambria County War Memorial Arena. They were the first of two teams that would play in Johnstown. The second were the Johnstown Riverhawks of the American Indoor Football Association (formerly the Topeka Knights/Kings of the IFL). ==History== The Jackals were founded as an expansion team in 1999 and joined the original incarnation of the Indoor Football League along with several others expansion franchises. The team played in the Eastern Conference South. In the only season in the IFL, the team compiled a 3‚Äì13 record finishing in fourth place in the Eastern Conference. After the IFL was bought out by af2, the Flames were not among the many teams that moved to the new league and subsequently folded. The Jackals folded after the 2000 season after the league was purchased by the Orlando Predators of the Arena Football League. The next year, they became a new expansion team in the newly formed National Indoor Football League. The team was coached by former United High School football coach Frank Krevetski. The then-current coach of United High School, Chris Matava, joined the team as offensive coordinator. The Jackals name changed three times after their first season. Since Johnstown did not join the new league, they held a fan vote on a new team name. The fans voted on Jaguars, and the team rebranded, including a new logo and website. The NFL demanded that Johnstown must change the team name, since the Jacksonville Jaguars own the right to the name. The team rebranded again, this time to the Jags. The NFL contacted Johnstown again, and informed them it was still too close to Jacksonville's name. Johnstown rebranded one final time; this time to J-Dogs. The team name was loosely based on Morley's Dog, a mythological dog that supposedly saved lives during the Great Johnstown Flood of 1889. The team folded after the 2002 season. ==References== Category:Johnstown, Pennsylvania Category:Indoor Football League (1999‚Äì2000) teams Category:American football teams in Pennsylvania Category:1999 establishments in Pennsylvania Category:Defunct American football teams in Pennsylvania Category:2000 disestablishments in Pennsylvania ","title":"Johnstown Jackals"},{"id":"56589600","text":"Giampaolo Vettolani (born 27 December 1950) is an Italian astrophysicist who is the scientific director of the National Institute for Astrophysics in Rome (INAF) since 2012. == Biography == In 1973 he graduated with a distinction in physics from the University of Bologna upon the thesis The angular momentum of galaxies (Il momento angolare delle Galassie), supervised by Giancarlo Setti.

He was suffect consul in the nundinium of July-August 98 as the colleague of Aulus Vicirius Martialis.Alison E. Cooley, The Cambridge Manual of Latin Epigraphy (Cambridge: University Press, 2012), p. 466 Postumus is known entirely from inscriptions. Postumus is also attested as a member of the Arval Brethren, and the dates he is recorded as attending their ceremonies in their surviving records, the Acta Arvalia, provide some indication about his age. The Acta first mention his presence in January 69, and thus was admitted to that collegia before then. He is present over the following years through May 105; a gap in the Acta Arvalia follows, and when their records pick up again in the year 117 his name no longer appears. It can be surmised that Maecius Postumus died between those dates. == Life == The origins of Postumus are disputed. In her doctoral dissertation, Sarah Hillebrand suggests he came from Gallia Narbonensis;Hillebrand, Der Vigintivirat: Prosopographische Untersuchungen f√ºr die Zeit von Augustus bis Domitian, p. 42 however, John D. Grainger asserts Postumus was a native of Italy.Grainger, Nerva and the Roman succession crisis of AD 96-99 (London: Routledge, 2003) p. 101 His cursus honorum is partially known from an inscription recovered at Antioch. The first office Postumus held was in the decemviri stlitibus judicandis, one of the four boards that formed the vigintiviri; membership in one of these four boards was a preliminary and required first step toward gaining entry into the Roman Senate. This was followed by service as a military tribune in Legio XIII Gemina. After this, Postumus served as quaestor in attendance to the emperors Vespasian and Titus; in her doctoral dissertation Sarah Hillebrand dated this to the year 79, although Postumus could have held it any year Vespasian was emperor since his son Titus was considered his co-emperor.Hillebrand, Der Vigintivirat, p. 205 Upon completion of this traditional Republican magistracy Postumus would be enrolled in the Senate. The inscription breaks off after telling us he had been a plebeian tribune. Postumus' tenure as praetor can be deduced. This office was usually held when the Senator reached the age of 30, or in the year 84. It is unusual that 14 years separate this magistracy from his acceding to the consulate; the more normal time between the two offices was five to ten years. The reason for this might have been that Postumus was in disfavor with the emperor at the time, Domitian. Another is that Postumus may have refused to participate in service to Domitian, as had a number of other senators such as Quintus Corellius Rufus. One more office can be deduced for Postumus: legatus or commander of one of the legions stationed in Syria, which would explain the presence of his inscription in that province. Grainger notes the composition of the consuls selected for the year 98 is significant, as it was the first year where the emperor Nerva could select all of the men to accede to the consulate; he could not alter the composition of the previous year, which had been drawn up by the deceased Domitian, without gratuitously offending people. Although it was a largely ceremonial office, being consul for even part of the year bestowed much prestige in a status-preoccupied society. Yet the composition of that year is unusual, both in having twelve names -- far more than was usual for that decade -- and having Trajan as ordinary consul for six months. Five men thus were associated with Nerva's heir apparent for the first half of the year, while the second half is shared by three pairs of consuls. Grainger argues that Nerva's arrangement originally comprised the consuls of the second half, with Sextus Julius Frontinus likely as Nerva's original choice for a colleague; Grainger notes that Frontinus enjoyed a third consulate only two years later, and as ordinary consul, possibly to repay Frontinus for allowing Trajan to take his place in the original arrangement.Grainger, Nerva, pp. 13ff Where the consuls of the first half of 98 all are notable senators enjoying their second consulships, Grainger notes that the six populating the last half are \\"generally Italian nonentities, the professional senators who gained their posts by virtue of their wealth and lived on long enough to become governors of Asia or Africa when their turn came.\\" Postumus' life after his consulate until his death after the year 105 is presently a blank. == References == Category:1st-century Romans Category:2nd-century Romans Category:Suffect consuls of Imperial Rome Category:2nd-century deaths Postumus, Lucius Maecius ","title":"Lucius Maecius Postumus"},{"id":"56589685","text":"Anil Wadha; born 26 May 1957https://web.archive.org/web/20180422070724/https://mea.gov.in/writereaddata/images/Civi_List_27-7-12.pdf is an Indian diplomat who belongs to the Indian Foreign Service.
