Offer, who had previously been a successful vegetable chopper salesman and businessman, resumed selling vegetable choppers at swap meets to support himself and raise money to complete his film project. Within a few months, he had earned enough to resume production, and the movie was finally completed, released, and marketed entirely on late-night infomercials that Offer paid for with his earnings from the swap meet vegetable chopper sales. The film has reportedly sold in excess of 100,000 copies. ==Reception== According to IMDb, The Underground Comedy Movie played on one movie theater screen on May 16, 1999, earning $856.https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0201290/business?ref_=tt_dt_bus The film earned less-than-favorable reviews, receiving a 33% from Rotten Tomatoes based on 6 reviews. The New York Post said it \\"may be the least amusing comedy ever made.\\" Lawrence Van Gelder of The New York Times offered a scathing review, describing the movie as \\"a series of sketches built around subjects like masturbation, defecation, alienation, urination, necrophilia, voyeurism, casual brutality, and mockery of the unfortunate.\\" Van Gelder added that tasteless or offensive material can be funny in the right hands, but that Offer \\"makes the common mistake of equating the recognition of comic potential for comedy itself. For the successful, talent bridges the gap, but, here, [talent] is absent.\\" ==Lawsuits== The film was the subject of several lawsuits filed by Offer against others. On September 23, 1998, Vince Offer filed a suit against 20th Century Fox and the co-directors of There's Something About Mary, Bobby and Peter Farrelly. Offer claimed that 14 scenes in Mary were lifted from his film. The Farrellys released this statement: \\"We've never heard of him, we've never heard of his movie, and it's all a bunch of baloney.\\" The case was dismissed with prejudice on a motion for summary judgment by order of the court in 2000, and 20th Century Fox was awarded $66,336.92 in attorneys' fees.Offer v. Farrelly, Case No. CV 98-7697 RAP(RCx) (C.D. Cal. Jan. 13, 2000); id. (Mar. 14, 2000). In 2000, Offer successfully sued Anna Nicole Smith for $4 million, claiming that Smith had agreed to be in his movie, but backed out in 1996 over fears that appearing in the movie would be detrimental to her career.Movie & TV News @ IMDb.com – WENN – 23 October 2000 In 2004, Offer sent out a press release through prnewsonline.com announcing his intention to sue the Church of Scientology.

At Gupta's house, he is introduced to his wife Karuna (Madhabi Mukherjee). Amitabha is shocked to find her to be the girl he once loved and had let down. Unaware of their past relationship, Gupta entertains Amitabha. He comes across as a simple man with none of the physical or intellectual charms of Roy. Amitabha feels uneasy around Karuna and is unable to sleep. He asks for sleeping pills from Karuna, and manages to steal a few moments alone with Karuna. He conveys to her about his love and asks her to leave her husband. Karuna refuses to answer his inquiries as to whether she is happy in her marriage. Unable to regain the old intimacy with her, he remembers his betrayal. It was the last time he saw her. Forced by her uncle who did not approve of the relationship and wanted to send her away, she came to him. Even though he was a poor student, she had made up her mind to accept his situation and surrender her comfortable life, educational plans and family relationships all to marry him.

It gained some fame in the pre-American Revolutionary War Colony of Virginia as a gathering place for legislators after several Royal Governors officially dissolved the House of Burgesses, the elected legislative body, when their actions did not suit the Crown. It was also the site of the founding of the Phi Beta Kappa Society on December 5, 1776.Tyler, p. 166 Rebuilt in 1930–31, it was both the first building to be reconstructed and to be opened as part of Colonial Williamsburg. Unlike several other taverns in Williamsburg that operate as restaurants or inns, the reconstructed Raleigh Tavern building serves as a museum, showing visitors how the tavern would have appeared. It was named after Sir Walter Raleigh, an important figure in the English settlement of Virginia. A lead bust of Raleigh sat above the entrance door. ==History== Engraving of the Apollo Room as it appeared in the 1850s during the visit by Benson Lossing From 1699 to 1779, Williamsburg served as the capital of the colony of Virginia. As such, there were numerous taverns to host legislators and other visitors having business with the government while the House of Burgesses was in session. The original tavern is believed to have been built some point prior 1735. It changed ownership and keepers numerous times, continuing in use as a tavern, eventually being acquired by local cabinetmaker Anthony Hay (father of jurist George Hay) in 1767. The tavern was an institution in Williamsburg; auctions as well as balls were held under the Raleigh's aegis. The tavern was the site of reception dinners held for at least two Royal Governors upon their arrival to Virginia: Robert Dinwiddie in November 1751, and Lord Botetourt in October 1768. In May 1769, the Raleigh Tavern began its role as a center of sedition when the Governor Botetourt dissolved the House of Burgesses, because of resolutions against the Townshend Acts. After its dissolution, the burgesses immediately convened in the Apollo Room as the 'late representatives of the people' and adopted the Non-Importation Agreement. The House of Burgesses was reconvened by the Governor in November that year. This room was the frequent rendezvous of Thomas Jefferson, Patrick Henry, and other Revolutionary patriots. They met here in 1773 to develop intercolonial committees of correspondence. Dissolved by Governor Dunmore, the Burgesses met again in the Apollo Room in May 1774. The Marquis de Lafayette was entertained at a banquet here in 1824, and the building remained in continual use as a tavern until it burned at the hands of an arsonist in 1859. ==Architecture== Based on period prints, the present reconstruction is an L-shaped white weatherboard building with 18 dormer windows. The main room of the Raleigh Tavern was a banqueting hall known as the Apollo Room. Accounts note that the Latin motto Hilaritas sapientiae et bonae vitae proles (\\"jollity is the offspring of wisdom and good living\\") was written over the mantel.http://xroads.virginia.edu/~Hyper/VAGuide/williamsburg.html Historian Lyon Gardiner Tyler wrote of the room that it \\"witnessed probably more scenes of brilliant festivity and political excitement than any other single apartment in North America\\". ==Reconstruction== The reconstructed tavern The tavern was reconstructed in 1930–31 on its original foundation. At a ceremony overseen by Virginia Gov. John Garland Pollard, the tavern opened to the public on September 16, 1932, thus marking the opening of Colonial Williamsburg. The reconstructed Raleigh Tavern is one of the more modest but popular attractions of Colonial Williamsburg, a living history museum depicting life in Virginia's colonial capital city. It stands on Duke of Gloucester Street in contrast to the elaborate Capitol Building. ==NotesReferencesExternal links== * Raleigh Tavern at Colonial Williamsburg Raleigh Tavern Raleigh Tavern Category:Colonial Williamsburg Category:Taverns in the American Revolution Category:Taverns in Virginia Category:Buildings and structures completed in 1931 Category:Historic district contributing properties in Virginia Category:Rebuilt buildings and structures in Virginia Category:National Register of Historic Places in Williamsburg, Virginia Category:Drinking establishments on the National Register of Historic Places in Virginia Category:Hotel buildings on the National Register of Historic Places in Virginia ","title":"Raleigh Tavern"},{"id":"5555347","text":"John William Powell (July 3, 1919 – December 15, 2008) was a journalist and small business proprietor who was most well known for being tried for sedition after publishing an article in 1952 that reported on allegations made by Mainland Chinese officials that the United States and Japan were carrying out germ warfare in the Korean War. This news was reported in Shanghai in an English language journal, the \\"China Monthly Review\\", published by Powell. In 1956, the Eisenhower Administration's Department of Justice pressed sedition charges against John W. Powell, his wife Sylvia, and Julian Schuman, after grand jury indictments, which had been sought by Federal prosecutors, were handed down against the three North Americans who had published the allegations about bacteriological warfare. However, the prosecutors failed to get any convictions. The defendants refused to reveal any self-incriminating evidence, as was their Constitutional right, and U.S. Department of Defense officials also refused to provide any incriminating archives or witnesses to the Federal court. [Information on this did turn up decades later as a result of Freedom of Information Act requests.] All three of the defendants were acquitted of all charges over the next six years, after a Federal judge dismissed the core aspects of the case against them in 1959, due to the obviously insufficient evidence against them. ==Early life== Powell was born in Shanghai, China, in 1919. One year later, Powell's parents decided that Shanghai was unsafe for their infant, so they sent him to live with his mother's family in Hannibal, Missouri. In 1917, Powell's father, John Benjamin Powell, had been a co-founder of the tiny publication, the China Weekly Review (originally Thomas Franklin Fairfax Millard’s Review of the Far East, 1922 renamed Weekly Review of the Far East, 1923 renamed The China Weekly Review, retaining the Chinese heading Mìlè Pínglúnbào 《密勒評論報》, i.e. “Millard’s Review”), modeled after the influential American political journals The New Republic and The Nation, and which featured original reporting, reports on Chinese subjects, and editorials.Neil O'Brien: American Editor in Early Revolutionary China. John William Powell and the China Weekly/Monthly Review. Routledge, 2004; ; p. 2. Interrupting his journalism studies at the University of Missouri, Powell rejoined his father at the China Weekly Review. After the Japanese Attack on Pearl Harbor, Powell joined the American Office of War Information, the military's journalism program, as a news editor. In 1943, Powell was sent to Chungking, China, a city in far southwestern China (and the wartime capital of Free China), where he remained for the rest of the war. For eight years after World War II, from 1945 until June, 1953, Powell published his journal, first as the \\"China Weekly Review\\" and later on, when its revenues declined greatly, as the \\"China Monthly Review\\". Powell met his wife Sylvia Powell in 1947, while he was in Shanghai opening up a news bureau for the Office of War Information, and they were married soon afterwards. ==Life in San Francisco== After returning to the United States from China, the Powells bought an old house on Potrero Hill in San Francisco, undertook extensive repairs and renovations, and then sold it for a profit. They next settled into a pattern of buying, rehabilitating, and reselling fourteen houses and several apartment buildings. \\"It was kind of rough,\\" John Powell said, \\"Obviously, I couldn't get a job on a newspaper. I tried various things, working as a salesman, selling teaching aids to schools.\\" Eventually, the Powells bought a house on Church Street, in San Francisco's Mission District, and lived there for thirty years. This house had a storefront where they also ran an antiques shop for about fifteen years. Powell died on December 15, 2008, in San Francisco at the age of 89.Fox, Margalit (December 17, 2008). \\"John W. Powell, 89, Dies; Writer in Sedition Case\\".

On April 26, 1956, the Powells, along with an associate at the \\"China Monthly Review\\", learned that a Federal Grand Jury had indicted each of them on a charge of sedition. Each count in the indictment was punishable by up to twenty years in prison and up to $10,000 in fines. The most damaging charge was that the defendants had falsely reported that the United States had engaged in bacteriological warfare during the Korean War, and that North Koreans had forced American Prisoners of War to read published reports of these charges as part of their indoctrination processes and brainwashing. In their coverage of the breaking news, the San Francisco Chronicle newspaper, among other news publications, used two-inch- high bold type on its front page, exclaiming \\"S.F. JURY INDICTS WRITER – SEDITION\\". The grand jury had charged Powell with a dozen counts of sedition and a count of conspiring to commit sedition. His wife, Sylvia and Julian Schuman, who had been Powell's associate editor, were also charged with a single count of conspiracy, each. The Powells responded to the charges by asserting they had properly reported on what was said by Chinese officials and troops coming from the front lines of the Korean War. Powell's trial, which ended in a mistrial, took place in 1959 at the Federal Courthouse in San Francisco, the same location where Marie Equi had been tried and convicted of sedition in 1918. The treason charges against Powell were formally dismissed in July, 1959, and two years later, in 1961, Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy finally dropped the rest of the sedition charges. ==Later developments== Although direct official evidence such as military records and similar documentation that bacteriological warfare was employed during the Korean War by either side does not exist, some contend that there is overwhelming indirect and unofficial evidence that the US used biological weapons during this war. In an effort to advocate his opinions about American involvement in bacteriological warfare in Asia, Powell published an article titled \\"Japan's Germ Warfare: The U.S. Cover-up of a War Crime\\" in the October/December, 1980, issue of the \\"Bulletin of Concerned Asian Scholars\\". An editor from the United Press International had told Powell his story was \\"old news,\\" and it was not published by mainstream publications. However, with the documents that he had obtained under the Freedom of Information Act, Powell was able to provide additional evidence supporting his earlier reports in the \\"China Monthly Review\\". The second article, \\"Japan's Biological Weapons, 1930-1945,\\" was published in the October 1981 edition of The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists. It wasn't until 1989 that a detailed account of the Japanese bacteriological warfare experiments in China appeared. The British journalists Peter Williams and David Wallace published their book, \\"Unit 731: Japan's Secret of Secrets\\" (London: Hodder and Stoughton). [Also published in New York City that same year as \\"Unit 731: Japan's Secret Biological Warfare in World War II\\"]. Even in the 21st Century, 60 years after the Japanese bacteriological warfare camps, American intelligence agencies and the Department of Defense still withhold certain information about the World War II Japanese program in China. Powell's articles in The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists eventually led to the broadcast of segments on the CBS-TV investigative news program 60 Minutes and ABC-TV's 20/20 program. Powell's reporting had brought widespread public attention to the use of bacteriological warfare, which helped prompt the United States Congress into hearing testimony from former American Prisoners of War in 1982 and 1986. == See also == * Allegations of biological warfare in the Korean War == References Further reading== * A Plague Upon Humanity: The Secret Genocide of Axis Japan's Germ Warfare Operation, Daniel Barenblatt, New York: HarperCollins, 2004, * The United States and Biological Warfare: Secrets from the Early Cold War and Korea, Stephen Endicott and Edward Hagerman, Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1998 * Unit 731: The Japanese Army's Secret of Secrets, Peter Williams and David Wallace, London: Hodder and Stoughton, 1989.

It is situated east from the city and county town of Lincoln, south-east from the nearest market town of Spilsby, and inland from the holiday resort town of Skegness. The village lies on the northern side of the waterway today known as the Steeping River, which is the lower element of the River Lymn that sources in the Lincolnshire Wolds. Firsby was once the location of one of the busiest railway stations on the East Coast of England. The 2001 Census recorded a village population of 276, increasing slightly at the 2011 census to 278. ==History== Early history Historically Firsby belonged to the Wold division of the Wapentake of Candleshoe and was in a part of ancient Lindsey. In his History of the County of Lincolnshire written in 1834, historian Thomas Allen records \\"Firsby is an obscure place on the north side of the River Limb (sic) between Wainfleet and Spilsby, being five miles distant from each\\".Allen, Thomas The history of the county of Lincoln. p. 147 Allen further comments that \\"Firsby's St Andrew's Church is an ancient crumbling edifice in a state of great decay. The single aisled church is thatched and in front of the porch is a bare pillar of stone that may have at one time held a sundial\\". Before the Reformation the church belonged to the Abbey at Bardney and was presented to the village by the Norman Lord of the Manor Sir Gilbert de Gaunt (1048-1094). The rectory was valued in 1834 at £12 0s 7d (£12.03). The original Norman church was demolished and a new church building erected in 1856 on the same site. There were once two public houses in the village although both are closed. One of the public houses had its own brewery, and the other serviced the railway and doubled as the Railway Hotel. There are other records that mention a third drinking establishment around 1852, Whyley's Beerhouse, that stood adjacent to Firsby railway station. The local beer houses were introduced by the 1830 Beer Act which permitted anybody to open a licensed beer and cider house in their front room for a licence fee of two guineas, but they were not permitted to sell spirits or fortified wines. Many beer houses went on to develop as full public houses to sell a range of drinks, and still exist; by 1885 those that hadn't become pubs had died out. At the beginning of the 20th century the village had a football team, which played its fixtures on a field behind the Railway Hotel, with a clubhouse and changing rooms next to the field. A previous village hall was situated beside the main Spilsby to Wainfleet road. Railway connections The railway station at Firsby opened in 1848 and was a substantial structure for a country station, totally unlike the majority of small isolated rural halts. The station had three platforms each two hundred metres long, with buildings, booking offices, male, female and general waiting rooms, restaurants, toilets, baggage and goods halls, crew rooms, staff canteen and numerous railway offices. The main line tracks were crossed by a substantial passenger footbridge and most of the station was covered by an ornate cast-iron and glass canopy.\\"Images of Firsby (Courtesy of Ian Jopson)\\" , homepage.ntlworld.com/david.enefer. Retrieved 28 July 2011 The station also had signal boxes, water towers, goods sidings and engine repair sheds. Firsby was a junction for the Skegness line and the Spilsby line on their short branches from the main GNR London to Cleethorpes railway. During the summer months holiday passenger traffic, from throughout the country alighting at Firsby for the connection to Skegness, was substantial with hundreds and sometimes thousands of passengers passing through the station at a weekend. In the Victorian era most holidaymakers travelled by train and Firsby was one of the busiest stations on the East Lincolnshire Railway. The station was the major employer in the area and between the station master and his assistants, ticket office staffs, ticket inspectors, signalmen, porters, catering staffs, drivers, firemen, guards and track maintenance staff for three separate railway companies, several hundred people worked at, or from, Firsby station on a daily basis. Between 1943 and 1958 Firsby station was kept busy as the nearest railhead staging point for RAF and later USAF airmen travelling to and from the nearby RAF Spilsby airfield at Great Steeping. The line was closed down in 1970 due to the Beeching cuts, and the majority of the station and the platforms were demolished. Only the most southerly section of the station building remains and is now a private residence. With the old east coast main line between Firsby and Cleethorpes removed a new direct link to Skegness was installed at the junction a few hundred metres south from the old Firsby station. A common call at the station was \\"Over the bridge for Skegness\\"\\"Spilsby Area Village Guide\\", Skegness Standard, 26 October 2005. Retrieved 28 July 2011 Firsby to Spilsby Railway A small local railway company built a branch line from Firsby junction to Spilsby, which it opened on 1 May 1868. The branch was just over long and connected Spilsby to the King's Cross, London to Cleethorpes main line. The only other railway station on the branch line was Halton Holegate Halt. Necessary parliamentary permission was obtained by an Act in July 1865 which incorporated The Spilsby & Firsby Railway Company with an authorised capital of £20,000 and loans of £8,333 for the construction of the four-mile-long single-track branch.\\"Railway Station by Clive Ironmonger\\", spilsby.info. Retrieved 28 July 2011 Construction of the railway began in March 1867 with the ceremonial cutting of the first turf performed by local rector, the Reverend Rawnsley who was standing in for the railway company's chairman Lord Willoughby de Eresby. The railway was expected to be opened quickly but disputes with the contractors arose over the quality of their work and several lengths of track had to be replaced. With these problems finally fixed the official opening took place. Initial traffic levels and income were promising, however by 1885 rail traffic had slumped leading to the Great Northern Railway buying out the Spilsby & Firsby Railway Company for £20,000 through an Act of Parliament on 25 July 1890. In 1920 there was a major accident when the Spilsby engine was derailed and passengers had to be transported by road. When the locomotive was returned to the tracks it managed to reach Firsby in a record eight and a half minutes instead of the normal thirteen minutes. A few days later the train ran into the buffers of another stationary train at Firsby and several passengers were badly shaken. A 71-year-old local businessman, Mr. Welch, died the following day from the delayed effects of the accident. Falling usage caused passenger services to be suspended in 1939 just as the Second World War began and they were never reinstated. A goods train service for grain, potatoes, livestock and other agricultural products continued through Firsby for almost another twenty years. Goods including petrol, paraffin and coal continued into Spilsby via the rail link until its closure on 30 November 1958. The Spilsby station building has been demolished but other buildings still stand, and in recent years have been used by an agricultural suppliers as a shop and store with new sections added. Between Firsby and Spilsby most of the old track route can still be seen in aerial photographs, marked by the avenue of trees and bushes, with only 5% ploughed out into fields. ==Governance== Parish Firsby is governed by the Firsby group Parish Council that covers the villages of Bratoft, Firsby, Great Steeping, Irby in the Marsh, and Little Steeping. The current (2013) chairman is Richard Kidd of Irby in the Marsh, and the vice chairman, Robert Heane of Great Steeping. District Firsby falls within East Lindsey District Council and in 2013 is represented by Pauline Cooper (Conservative). County Council Firsby's 2013 county councillor to Lincoln County Council is Neil Cooper (Conservative) Westminster Firsby falls within the Louth and Horncastle constituency; the serving MP is Peter Tapsell (Conservative). ==Geography== Firsby stands on the northern side of the River Steeping waterway, which is the lower part of the River Lymn, and to the east of the Lincolnshire Wolds on a tract of flat fenland, bounded by Boston Deeps and the North Sea. It is within inland by road from the holiday centre of Skegness on the Lincolnshire coast. The Wolds comprise a series of low hills and steep valleys underlain by calcareous chalk, green limestone and sandstone rock, laid down in the Cretaceous period under a shallow warm sea. The characteristic open valleys of the Wolds were created during the last ice age through the action of glaciation and meltwater. Geographically, the Lincolnshire Wolds are a continuation of the Yorkshire Wolds which run through the East Riding of Yorkshire, the Wolds as a whole having been bisected by the erosive power of the waters of the Humber. The fenlands, that stretch down as far as Norfolk, are former wetlands consisting both of peat bogs and tidal silt marshes which were virtually all drained by the end of the 19th century when Firsby had its longest period of growth. The former peat fens and silt marshes provided a rich loamy soil that was ideal for the growing of cereal and vegetable crops, and gave Lincolnshire its reputation as being the 'bread basket' of England. The resulting flat lands also made an ideal environment for the later mechanisation of farming in the mid-20th century. Firsby has always been an agriculturally based village with a dark and rich loamy soil over a heavy clay subsoil. ==Demography== The population in 1834 was recorded as 142. By 1921 that had risen to 231 and has remained reasonably constant ever since. The 2001 census recorded the following information for Firsby: Population: 276 52.5% male and 47.5% female. Average age 39.8 18.4% are single and never married, 64.2% married with the remainder split between separated, divorced or widowed. 98.9% are white and 1.1% of mixed race. 83% declared a Christian religion, 1.1% Buddhist and 15.9% stated no religion 57% are employed, 18.7% retired, 2.6% unemployed and the remainder are disabled, full- time carers or students. ==Education== There are no schools in the village. School bus transport is provided by Lincolnshire Education Authority. Most primary school children attend Great Steeping Primary School, a mixed sex rural primary school which has approximately 115 pupils with 67 boys and 48 girls. Secondary school age pupils can attend: *King Edward VI Academy in Spilsby, a coeducational bi-lateral secondary school, sixth form college and specialist Humanities College for children between the ages of eleven and eighteen. *St Clement's College (formerly known as the Earl of Scarborough High School), a secondary modern on Burgh Le Marsh Road, Skegness. *Skegness Grammar School on Vernon Road, Skegness. ==Religious sites== Firsby Grade II listed Anglican church is dedicated to St Andrew. It is constructed of limestone ashlar, and was rebuilt in 1856 by architect George Edmund Street at a cost of £850.Kelly's Directory of Lincolnshire with the port of Hull 1885, p. 393 Firsby Methodist Church, a Wesleyan chapel built in 1838, is on Fendyke Road.

The song is an upbeat dance number, in which the singer pleads with someone to \\"love her tonight\\" and tells (probably) him that she has an \\"infatuation\\" with him. The song appears to have only been recorded in English, despite the Contest tradition of frequently recording versions in the native language of the relevant country. This was, however, not something that any Belarusian entry has done until Eurovision Song Contest 2017 when Naviband performed the first Belarusian language entry also in Kiev. The song was penned by the Greek composer Nikos Terzis. Terzis authored four previous Greek ESC entries, including two who made it to the third place - Antique's hit \\"Die For You\\" (2001) and Sakis Rouvas' dance number, \\"Shake It\\". Agurbash was originally meant to sing the ballad \\"Boys and Girls\\"; however, the poor reception of that song changed both her mind and those of her production team. As Belarus had not finished the previous Contest in the top 10, the song was performed in the semi-final, as eighth in the running order (following Israel's Shiri Maimon with Hasheket Shenish'ar and preceding the Netherlands' Glennis Grace with My Impossible Dream). Despite pre-contest popularity, it could only managed to garner 67 points by the end of voting to finish in 13th place and force Belarus to compete in the semi-final again at the 2006 Contest. For the semi-final performance, Angelica and her dancers were dressed in baroque-inspired semi- historical costumes, even though no direct reference to the lyrics can be made, and the promotional video clip of the song featured modern costumes of both the singer and accompanying dancers. Continuing the long tradition of Eurovision strip songs, whose beginnings can be traced back to famous \\"Making Your Mind Up\\" performance many years previously, the performance featured Agurbash gradually having parts of her dress removed, effectively going through no less than two costume changes.BBC NEWS  Entertainment  Diva tactics in play at Eurovision The song was succeeded as Belarusian entry by \\"Mum\\", performed by Polina Smolova. ==Charts== {  !align=\\"center\\"Chart (2005) !align=\\"center\\"Peak position - align=\\"left\\"Greece (IFPI Top 50 Singles) align=\\"center\\"16 } == References == Category:Eurovision songs of Belarus Category:Eurovision songs of 2005 Category:Songs written by Nikos Terzis Category:2005 songs ","title":"Love Me Tonight (Angelica Agurbash song)"},{"id":"5555383","text":"Bushido Karaoke is the third full-length album by Nebraska's Mayday, full of songs of death, dismemberment, drugs, greed, and devotion.

It is part of the civil parish of Holland Fen with Brothertoft . ==History== Evidence has been found that the area now known as Brothertoft was known to the Romano-British people. The site of a possible building was uncovered at Cannons Farm in Punchbowl Lane between 1957 and 1959. A denarius of Septimius Severus was found along with pottery, potsherds, animal bones, ditches and hollows. A Roman vase was dug up about 1970 at a separate site in Brothertoft by Mr Epton. The hamlet is first recorded some time after 1350 and before 1540. Brothertoft hamlet is mentioned in the Diocesan Return of 1563 (Deanery of Holland, parish of Kirton,) as having ten households. William Marrat, a local historian writing in 1814, noted that the traditional belief for the origins of the village name lay in a grant being awarded to two brothers in order that they could \\"inclose\\" (that is, separate and cultivate) the area from the surrounding fenland. The word toft is thought to come from the Danish occupiers of Lincolnshire in ancient times and has the meaning of homestead or enclosure. Hence the place name of Brother-Toft. In an addendum Marrat wrote that the place had been a vaccaria (or vaccary \\\\- literally, a cow shed) of the abbey at Swineshead and had once been called Toft because of it relatively raised position above the fens. There are records of receipts which were probably from the area in the Swineshead entries of the Valor Ecclesiasticus. These are not definitive as another historian of the period, Pishey Thompson, pointed out that Toft was used as a name both for Brothertoft and Fishtoft in the late fourteenth century. The raised position did not exclude the area from flooding and, for example, in 1763 the villagers were forced to live in the upper stories of buildings due to the amount of water ingress. Sempringham Priory While the surrounding land belonged to Swineshead in medieval times, the manor of Brothertoft was worked by the Sempringham Priory. The Order of Sempringham originated in 1131. About that time Gilbert of Sempringham became the rector of the church of Sempringam. He then instituted the rule of St. Augustine and many statutes from the customs of Augustinian and Premonstratensian canons. The Valor Ecclesiasticus of 1535 values \\"Brodertofte\\" at £9.16s.1d. On 18 September 1538 Brothertoft was surrendered by Robert Holgate, chaplain to Cromell, with Roger the Prior (Prior of 1538) and 16 canons as part of the dissolution of the monasteries. Carre family of Sleaford By 1553 Robert Carre (sometimes spelled Carr) of Sleaford owned the manor of Brothertoft, which was left to his cousin Robert Carre. Robert Carre, cousin to Robert Carre, lived at the old Carre House at Sleaford. He died in 1590. Sir Edward Carre, 1st Baronet of Sleaford, was the owner in 1614 at which time his Brothertoft tenants were charged with the diking of part of South Ea as commoners in Holland fen. Edward was married twice and had three issue from his second marriage to Anne Dyer: Rochester, Sir Robert and Lucy. He resided at old Hall at Dunsby and died in 1618. Sir Robert Carr, son of Edward and 2nd Baronet of Sleaford, and Lady Ann Carr were owners of Brothertoft in 1619. Lady Ann was likely Robert's mother, Ann Dyer Carre. Lucy Carre, daughter of Sir Robert Carre (died 1667) and \\"the Lady Mary Carre, daughter of Sir Richard Gargrave, married Sir Francis Holles (1627–89), later 2nd Lord of Holles (also spelled Hollis) in Westminster Abbey. Following Robert Carre's death, Francis Holles successfully secured for Lucy a good portion of Robert Carre's estates, although Brothertoft is not specifically named. Holles family The son of Francis Holles, Denzil, was initially the heir of Francis but died within two years of his father, and the land passed to his cousin John Holles, first Duke of Newcastle. Upon his death in 1711, much of his estate passed to his nephew, Thomas Pelham-Holles, who also became Duke of Newcastle. Charles Frederick Brothertoft manor was next owned by Sir Charles Frederick Who bought it from Thomas Pelham-Holles, Duke of Newcastle and Katherine Pelham, widow of Henry Pelham in 1761. Frederick died in December 1785, and his son Thomas Lenox Frederick sold it to John Cartwright, Esquire. Cartwright did not purchase the land until 1788. Holland Fen riot Prior to Frederick, the fenland often flooded to the point where boats had to be used for transport, and it was during his time at Brothertoft that drainage, and then enclosure began. Around 1767 the inhabitants of Brothertoft, who occupied 52 houses in the hamlet, were \\"most active\\" in rioting as a protest against the enclosure of Holland Fen. They regarded this land as being for their pleasure and sustenance, and in particular as a location for fishing and fowling. Aside from general rioting and the removal of recently erected fencing, up to 200 people also played football on the land in an attempt to assert their historic rights, forcing Frederick to send men to guard the area. The situation led to serious injury and deaths, including the loss of an eye by a Captain Wilks who had been employed by Frederick to command the guard and who was shot. This common land had also traditionally been the scene of an annual fair, called the Toft drift, lasting a week from 8 July and attracting visitors from nearby villages and from Boston. ==Buildings== Hall Brothertoft Church Hall and Park circa 1975 In 1788 the land was bought by Major John Cartwright, the political reformer. He sold his estate at Marnham, Nottinghamshire soon after and by the time he leased the estate and moved to Enfield, Middlesex in 1803 or 1805 had developed the rich loam soil into a profitable site for the cultivation of woad, assisted by new machinery, some of his own invention and some developed by his bailiff and later steward William Amos (agriculturist)Arthur Young,General View of the Agriculture of Lincolnshire, London, 2nd edn, 1813, pp. 76–77, 163. He began addressing his letters as being from Brothertoft Farm. At this time there was a building called Brothertoft Hall or Brothertoft house, to which the farm was an ancillary. Cartwright had extended Brothertoft house with octagonal additions to both ends and had also applied a stucco finish to the walls. Marrat described it as \\"an elegant mansion\\". He claims that it was originally built by Thomas Saul, founder of the Baptist chapel in Boston. Pishey Thompson believed the founder of the Boston chapel to be John Saul. Brothertoft Farm was extended in the early 19th century by Thomas Gee, a son of Henry Gee, a banker of Boston. Marrat recounted in 1814 that Cartwright had sold off much of the land as separate farms, that the holding had consisted of around and that the principal owners then had been Gee, T C Gerordot, C Dashwood, G Beedham and John Burrell. Cartwright had married the eldest daughter of Samuel Dashwood in 1780. The lands had a rateable value of £790 4s. 0d. in 1831–1832, with the \\"extra-parochial Pelham's Lands\\" being valued at £518 7s. 7d. (Pelham's Lands was near Fosdyke and by the 1870s comprised seven houses and a population of 54). At this time the area was a part of the Kirton Hundred or Wapentake, which itself had a total rateable value of £51,469 15s. 8d. By the mid-1850s there were 123 inhabitants and the lands consisted of , with the principal owners being Gee, Herbert Ingram, Henry Rogers, George Cartwright and Mrs Barnsdale.

Thomas Gee died in 1871, leaving his wife, Ann Leman Gee, as occupant of the Hall until her death in 1878. They are both buried at Brothertoft.The inscription on the gravestone of Thomas and Anne Gee pictured reads: Thomas : Gee of Brothertoft Born : March : 26 : 1788 Died : Sept : 6 : 1871 Anne : Gee: his : wife 1797 the : daughter : of : the R.e.v : Naunton : Thomas : Orgill : Leman of : Brampton : Hall : Suffolk died : May; 27 : 1878 : aged : 81 : years The Hall was subsequently occupied in turn by Frederick Curtois, Charles James Small, Henry Peart, and Ebenezer Larrington, It is still occupied today. Brothertoft Hall, built around 1780 and substantially extended about 1850, is now a Grade II listed building. Church Brothertoft chapel c 1843The church, which is dedicated to St. Gilbert of Sempringham, was a part of the chapelry of Kirton around 1837 and was owned by the lord of the manor, it being at that time a chapel of ease. ;History The Lincoln Diocesan Record Office holds registers baptisms, marriage and burials for the church going back to 1682. Marrat was of the opinion that the building was not particularly old, being built of brick and roofed with flat tiles, and that the Saxon window arches were the exception and perhaps indicated an earlier use for the building. He noted that the oldest register was from 1757. However, he subsequently amended his writings on the basis of new information which indicated a construction date around 1600 using materials from a chapel at Coningsby. Lewin also noted that he had seen registers, or perhaps copies of them, for as far back as 1682. A former monk of Bardney, Otto Buttolle, was curate of Brothertoft in 1554, long before the surviving church records and when the living had an annual stipend of £3 6s. 8d. (He also had an annual pension of £5 under the terms agreed following the dissolution of the monasteries). William Scoffin was curate from around 1683 until his ejection as a consequence of the Bartholomew Act in August 1686. He went on to minister a presbyterian congregation in Sleaford. A later holder of the living was William Tyler, rector and stepfather to Ann Chappell. Chappell married the navigator and cartographer Matthew Flinders in April 1801. The church was dedicated as a parish church in 1922. Five years later, in 1927 parts of the parishes of Holland Fen, Boston, Wyberton, Frampton, Kirton, Swineshead, Wigtoft, and extra-parochial land were transferred to the benefice of Brothertoft. ;Buildings Stephen Lewin described the church in 1843 as Rebuilt between 1847 and 1854 to a design by Lewin, the church is a Grade II listed building and has a small bell tower. In 1922, when St. Gilberts was dedicated as a parish church, the building of the rectory house was completed. School Some form of provision for education existed in the mid-1700s as this is when an \\"obscure poet\\", William Hall, was taught in Brothertoft for a period of six months. Thomas Gee erected a school at Brothertoft in 1856. In 1879 the North East Holland Fen United District School Board was formed, and on 4 April 1881 the newly built Hedgehog Bridge School opened on the North Forty Foot Bank, and children were schooled there until it closed in December 1969. The Misses Gee, sisters of Thomas Gee, opened the Boston Middle Girls School in Boston, which became the Conway School and is now the Excell International School.\\"The History and Antiquities of Boston: And the Villages of Skirbeck\\", Pishey Thompson, Page 294, 1856 ==Religion== Brothertoft Group The parish church is now part of the Church of England \\"Brothertoft Group\\" in the Diocese of Lincoln, known as the \\"Five in the Fen\\" that also includes: * All Saints at Holland Fen * Christ Church at Kirton Holme * St Peter at Wildmore * St Margaret of Scotland at Langrick Baptist There were prayer meetings being held by a group of Baptists in Brothertoft in 1813.

The album was recorded in May and November 2001 at Presto! Recording Studios in Lincoln, Nebraska. Mayday features the vocals and compositions of Lullaby for the Working Class frontman Ted Stevens. Ted is joined by the remaining Lullaby members, including Mike and A.J. Mogis, whose talents extend from behind the mixing console as players on the recording. The instrumentation of Old Blood is referential to the Lullaby staples of guitar, vibraphone, strings, and banjo, extending the formula with piano, organ, tympani, and loads of guest vocals. The resulting sound is both raw and ornate. Revisited themes of spring, rebirth, solidarity, florescence, and distress establish a unity of imagery amidst sporadic changes in song dynamic. The songs were selected from a long and arbitrary collection of demos that have been in the works for years. The name \\"Mayday\\" is significant in that Stevens and friends have held a small concert billed as Mayday each May 1 for the last six years. Stevens has spent the last couple of years playing in Cursive, as well as backing up Bright Eyes, Dave Dondero, Azure Ray, Simon Joyner, and The Good Life.

Primarily, in the Middle East (especially the Ottoman Empire), a divan was a long seat formed of a mattress laid against the side of the room, upon the floor or upon a raised structure or frame, with cushions to lean against. Divans received this name because they were generally found along the walls in Middle Eastern council chambers of a bureau called divan or diwan (from Persian, meaning a government council or office, from the bundles of papers they processed, and next their council chambers). Divans are a common feature of the liwan, a long, vaulted, narrow room in Levantine homes. The divan in the sense of a sofa or couch entered the English language in 1702 and has been commonly known in Europe since about the middle of the 18th century. It was fashionable, roughly from 1820 to 1850, wherever the romantic movement in literature penetrated. All the boudoirs of that generation were garnished with divans. They spread to coffee-houses, which were sometimes known as divans or Turkish divans, and a cigar divan remains a familiar expression. This is preserved today in Bulgarian, and in Hungarian as dívány, Italian as Divano, Romanian as divan,\\\\- DEX and Russian as диван (divan).

It is situated in the Southwestern corner of the country, in Namibe Province. It is roughly bound by the Atlantic Ocean to the West, an escarpment to the East that marks the beginning of the interior plateau, the Curoca River to the North, and the Cunene River to the South. It is about south of the city of Namibe and covers sq. miles. The topography of Iona is characterised by shifting dunes, vast plains, and rough mountains and cliffs. Annual average precipitation is no more than 30 mm. The Curoca River is intermittent but has lagoons, while the Cunene is permanent and has marshy areas at its mouth. Iona was proclaimed as a reserve in 1937 and upgraded to a national park in 1964. However, as is true for most Angolan parks, the Angolan Civil War greatly disrupted the area. Poaching and the destruction of infrastructure have caused considerable damage to the once rich park. In recent years, a number of government and international projects have worked on rebuilding the infrastructure of the park, which will hopefully invite tourists back. Tourism can provide tangible economic value to surrounding communities, giving them a reason to protect the park. ==Geography== Iona is in the northern Namib Desert, the only true desert in Southern Africa. The area, also known as the Kaokoveld Desert, is considered one of the oldest deserts in the world at 55-80 million years old. It faces the Atlantic Ocean for on the edge of the Benguela Current, a cold up-welling from the depths of the Atlantic that creates a rich offshore ecosystem. To the east, Iona rises to the base of the Great Escarpment at the Tchamaline and Cafema mountains. Iona is bound on the north and south by the Kunene and Curoca Rivers, respectively. The climate is noteworthy for the heavy fogs created as the cold, wet air of the Benguela up- welling meets the hot, dry air of the desert. The strong fogs and currents have led to numerous shipwrecks through history. The coast is sometimes called Skeleton Coast after these shipwrecks as well as the numerous skeletons of whales and seals found on the beaches. The area is classified as a Hot Desert Climate, BWh in the Köppen climate classification. Map of Iona National Park, Republic of Angola (Source: UN Development Programme) The park is contiguous with the Skeleton Coast National Park in Namibia, which is itself contiguous with the Namib-Naukluft National Park so that all three protected areas form a continuous block covering some 50,000 km2 of Namib Desert coastline and adjacent dunes. ==Flora & Fauna== Flora According to the Angola Ministry of the Environment, there are three types of vegetation at Iona National Park: * Sub-coastal steppes with woody and herbaceous components: This type of vegetation is a sub-coastal African steppe-like formation dominated by Acacia, Commiphora, Colophosphormum, Aristida, Schmidita, and Staria species. * Coastal steppes, which corresponds to sub-desert-like vegetation: This type of vegetation is dominated by Aristida, Cissus, Salvadora, and Welwitschia species. * Desert with moving dunes: This type of vegetation is dominated by Odyssea and Sporobolus species. The park is the main habitat of Welwitschia mirabilis, a plant sometimes referred to as a \\"living fossil\\". The plant derives its moisture from sea-fog dew which rolls in from the Atlantic. The dew is absorbed through the leaves rather than through roots alone. Fauna Because of its distinctive habitat and climate, Iona and the Kaokoveld Desert have a number of endemic animals, particularly reptiles. Of the 63 species recorded in the ecoregion, eight are strictly endemic. The endemics include two lizards, three geckos, and three skinks. The mouth of the Cunene River to the south supports a small wetland area that is important to migrating birds. South African cheetah were sighted in the park for the first time in 2010. ==Conservation== Off-roading Since 2009, a multinational program under the UNDP has been working with the Angola Ministry of Environment and local leaders to rehabilitate the park. Results have been recorded in the training and development of local staff, improvements to park infrastructure (fencing, roads, water supply, waste management, etc.), and the development of sound management for Iona. This park is to be included into the Iona - Skeleton Coast Transfrontier Conservation Area. From January 2020 Iona National Park falls under the management of African Parks, a non-governmental organization (NGO) focused on conservation. Together with the Government, African Parks will work closely with local communities, implement law enforcement, restore wildlife and position the park as a key destination, to ensure the long-term ecological, social and economic sustainability of Iona National Park. ==See alsoExternal links== * YouTube - There are Cheetahs in Angola!

It was released by the Motown label on May 28, 1991. == Critical reception == Jungle Fever received lukewarm reviews from critics. Reviewing for Entertainment Weekly in 1991, Bill Wyman said the album lacks worthwhile hooks and lyrics, and that Wonder's style of arrangement sounds \\"more and more dated as the years go by\\". In a positive review, Rolling Stone magazine called Jungle Fever a \\"welcome return to form\\" and said that Wonder has not \\"sounded so freewheeling, confident and engaging\\" since his 1980 album Hotter Than July. The Chicago Tribune wrote that it is \\"as direct and consistently tuneful as anything he has done in recent years\\". Robert Christgau of The Village Voice cited \\"Fun Day\\" and the title track as highlights and referred to Wonder as \\"a genius even if that's what he's selling\\". In a retrospective review for AllMusic, Stephen Thomas Erlewine cited Jungle Fever as \\"Wonder's best work in years ... a considerable improvement from his bland late-'80s albums\\", although he said Wonder can be too sentimental on ballads such as \\"These Three Words\\". J. D. Considine wrote in The Rolling Stone Album Guide (2004) that it is \\"lightweight but likeable\\". In his 2000 Consumer Guide book, Christgau gave the album a three-star honorable mention, which indicated \\"an enjoyable effort consumers attuned to its overriding aesthetic or individual vision may well treasure\\". ==Track listing== All songs written by Stevie Wonder, except \\"Chemical Love\\", lyrics by Stephanie Andrews. #\\"Fun Day\\" – 4:41 #\\"Queen in the Black\\" – 4:46 #\\"These Three Words\\" – 4:54 #\\"Each Other's Throat\\" – 4:17 #\\"If She Breaks Your Heart\\" (sung by Kimberly Brewer) – 5:03 #\\"Gotta Have You\\" – 6:26 #\\"Make Sure You're Sure\\" – 3:30 #\\"Jungle Fever\\" – 4:55 #\\"I Go Sailing\\" – 3:58 #\\"Chemical Love\\" – 4:26 #\\"Lighting Up the Candles\\" – 4:09 ==Personnel== Credits adapted from album’s liner notes.

It specializes in treating survivors of violence, the large majority of whom have been sexually abused. After years of military rape in South Kivu, there is increased civilian adoption of sexual violence. ==History== The Panzi Hospital was founded in 1999 by Communauté des Eglises de Pentecôte en Afrique Centrale (CEPAC, the Pentecostal Churches in Central Africa), itself founded by the Swedish Pentecostal Mission in 1921. Director Denis Mukwege has been operating on survivors of sexual violence for over a decade, and is one of only two doctors qualified to perform the reconstructive surgery. He published an analysis of the sexual violence crisis in eastern DRC in PLoS Medicine in Dec. 2009, based on his extensive, first- hand experience. Dr. Mukwege is the recipient of the UN 2008 Human Rights Award, the 2014 Sakharov Prize, and the 2018 Nobel Peace Prize. Despite its support network and the overwhelming need for the services it provides, the Panzi Hospital continually faces a shortage of money, supplies, and resources to expand its base of qualified personnel. The hospital was initially built for 120 beds but the total number of beds is now 350, out of which 200 are devoted to sexual violence survivors. On average, Panzi admits 410 patients per month and is currently running at maximum capacity. ==See also== * Social Aid For the Elimination of Rape (SAFER) ==References== Category:Buildings and structures in Bukavu Category:Hospitals in the Democratic Republic of the Congo Category:South Kivu Category:Hospital buildings completed in 1999 Category:Hospitals established in 1999 Category:Rape in the Democratic Republic of the Congo Category:Evangelical Christian hospitals Category:1999 establishments in the Democratic Republic of the Congo ","title":"Panzi Hospital"},{"id":"5555597","text":"Guylaine Cloutier (born October 1, 1971) is a former competition swimmer from Canada, who was a breaststroke specialist.

His operas Regeneration (Перерождение, 1777), and Saint-Petersburg's Trade StallsSometime translated as The Marketplace in St Petersburg or St Petersburg Bazaar; the full title: \\"As you live, so you will be judged, or Saint-Petersburg's Trade Stalls (Как поживёшь, так и прослывёшь' или Санкт Петербургский Гостный Двор\\") (Санкт Петербургский Гостный Двор) had considerable success. The second one, a scathing satire to the government officials and their thievish behaviour, is one of the first examples of Russian comic opera. It was staged on December 26, 1779 at the Knipper Theatre in St Petersburg and was repeated 16 times. Later the music was rewritten by a composer Vasily Pashkevich in 1882 and 1792. In a new version the opera was also staged at the Court Theatre.

He was born on February 5, 1917 (13th of Shevat, 5677) in Zhetl, in the Grodno Governorate of the Russian Empire (present-day Belarus). His father, Rabbi Zalman Sorotzkin was the town's rabbi. As a young man, Sorotzkin studied under Rabbi Elchonon Wasserman in the Baranovich Yeshiva, and then under Rabbi Baruch Ber Lebovitz in Kamenitz. In 1940, Rabbi Boruch Sorotzkin married Rochel Bloch, daughter of the Telzer Rav and Rosh Yeshiva, Rabbi Avraham Yitzchak Bloch. Sorotzkin was involved in the \\"tension\\" over visas needed to flee: the two factions were \\"those from Lithuanian versus Polish Yeshivot;\\" control of the Kobe committee was by \\"students from the Polish yeshivot.\\" The rabbi and his wife fled Europe at the start of World War II, via Shanghai, and made their way to the United States. There, they joined his wife's uncles (and his own cousins) Rabbi Eliyahu Meir Bloch and Rabbi Chaim Mordechai Katz who had re-established the Telz Yeshiva in Cleveland, Ohio. ==Teaching== In 1943 Sorotzkin began delivering classes in the yeshiva. In 1953 Sorotzkin was appointed associate dean of the yeshiva. In 1962 Sorotzkin became dangerously ill and the name Rephoel was added to his name. In 1964, when the Telz Rosh Yeshiva, Rabbi Chaim Mordechai Katz died, Sorotzkin together with Rabbi Mordechai Gifter assumed the leadership of the yeshiva. In the Telzer tradition, Rabbi Sorotzkin extended his sphere of activities to include even more areas of communal responsibility, such as working for Chinuch Atzmai, Torah Umesorah and Agudath Israel of America where he served as one of the youngest member of its Moetzes Gedolei HaTorah - Council of Torah Sages. In 1977, with the establishment of the Yeshiva in Israel, Rabbi Mordechai Gifter left to head the Yeshiva in Israel. Sorotzkin died on Saturday, February 10, 1979. The Hebrew date - 13 Shevat - was the same date as his birthday. He is buried on Har HaMenuchot. ==Family== He is survived by three sons and three daughters. His daughter Rebetzin Rassia Busel died in March 1998. His sons: Rabbi Yitzchok Sorotzkin serves as dean of the Telz Yeshiva and Mesivta of Lakewood, New Jersey; Rabbi Binyomin Sorotzkin is dean of Ateres Shlomo in Israel; Rabbi Eliyahu Meir Sorotzkin is dean of Yeshiva Tiferes Boruch Of North Plainfield, New Jersey. His sons-in-law, Rabbi Yaakov Busel is dean of RJJ of Edison, New Jersey, Rabbi Aryeh Schulman is rabbi of Kiryat Telz-Stone, Israel, Rabbi Nosson Boruch Herzka was a Rabbi and prominent Torah scholar in Lakewood, New Jersey. Rabbi Herzka passed away on December 8, 2018. Rabbi Yisroel Brog is dean of Tiferes Avigdor Wickliffe, Ohio.

It came into existence in 1991, replacing the \\"Club of Slovenian Local Councillors\\" (Slovene: , German: ), which had existed as an initiative of local Slovenian party lists from various local councils. Slovenian party lists have regularly contested elections in Carinthia since 1950. The current chairperson of the EL is Vladimir Smrtnik. thumb300pxleftLocal council election results for the Enotna lista in southern Carinthia in 2003 Since the percentage of Slovenians in Carinthia is below the election threshold in the Carinthian Parliament (10%), the EL cannot represent the Carinthian Slovenes in the Carinthian or Austrian Parliament. In 1975 the EL missed a mandate in the Carinthian parliament by a few hundred votes (the vote tally then, of 6130, is the highest the party ever got after World War II). In 1979, however, Carinthia was split up in four electoral districts, making it impossible for the EL to pass the threshold on its own, without making any electoral alliance. Therefore, on both Land and national levels, the EL has tended to participate in electoral unions (sometimes with the Greens, sometimes with the Liberal Forum). The party is represented on its own on the local level. It has councilors in several local councils in the bilingual region of Carinthia. Currently, 52 local councillors are members of the EL. Since March 2009, the municipality of Eisenkappel-Vellach () is run by a mayor of the EL.

The title means \\"five- year-old temple.\\" == Plot == Gilson and Gami Oseam follows two orphans, Gami (감이) and her younger brother Gilson (길손). Gami is a gentle and reserved blind girl, while Gilson is hyperactive and often gets into mischief. The two seek refuge at a Mahayana Buddhist temple, helping with the chores, as they cope with the loss of their mother and home several years ago due to a fire accident, which is also how Gami lost her sight. Gilson, too young to understand, still believes they will find their mother someday as Gami has never told him she died in the fire. Gilson accompanies a monk to go meditate in the mountains and find a cure for his sister's blindness, but ends up sacrificing his life for Gami's sight.

The song, both in its sound and length, was a change of pace for Wonder, who was trying to establish his own identity outside of the Motown sound. Besides its floaty ambience, it featured the singer as a virtual one-man band.[ Hogan, Ed at allmusic.com] The song reached a peak of #33 on the Billboard Pop charts. \\"Superwoman\\" chronicles the relationship Stevie had with his first wife, Syreeta Wright, a Motown singer and composer who entered the company as a secretary.

First published in 1970 in the Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction, it is a prequel, as Leiber had by that time been chronicling the pair's adventures for thirty years. The story forms part four of the collection Swords and Deviltry. It was awarded the 1970 Nebula Award for Best Novella and the 1971 Hugo Award for Best Novella. ==Plot summary== One murky night in Lankhmar, Fissif and Slevyas, members of the Thieves' Guild, steal some valuable jewels from Jengao the gem merchant. While returning to Thieves' House, they are ambushed by both the Gray Mouser and Fafhrd simultaneously, who steal their gems. Recognising kindred spirits, they agree to share the loot. They return to Mouser's lodgings, where Fafhrd is introduced to Mouser's woman Ivrian, while Ivrian meets Fafhrd's love interest, Vlana. Somewhat drunk, Mouser persuades Fafhrd to join him in a quest to infiltrate the headquarters of the Thieves' Guild, in the guise of members of the Beggars' Guild. They are initially successful, but their disguise comes unstuck when their glib story is seen through by Krovas, Grandmaster of the Thieves, and the Beggarmaster. Fleeing, they return to Mouser's hovel, only to find to their horror that both girls have been killed and partially eaten by giant rats and by Slivikin, a fast-moving evil witch-beast conjured up by Krovas's warlock, Hristomilo. In grief and anger, they return to Thieves' House and charge in, causing panic and chaos.

The Earth's mantle, including the transition zone, consists primarily of peridotite, an ultramafic igneous rock. The mantle was divided into the upper mantle, transition zone, and lower mantle as a result of sudden seismic- velocity discontinuities at depths of 410 and 660 km (250 to 400 mi). This is thought to occur as a result of rearrangement of grains in olivine (which constitutes a large portion of peridotite) at a depth of 410 km, to form a denser crystal structure as a result of the increase in pressure with increasing depth. Below a depth of 660 km, evidence suggests due to pressure changes ringwoodite minerals change into two new denser phases, bridgmanite and periclase. This can be seen using body waves from earthquakes, which are converted, reflected or refracted at the boundary, and predicted from mineral physics, as the phase changes are temperature and density-dependent and hence depth dependent. ==410 km discontinuity – phase transition== A peak is seen in seismological data at about 410 km as is predicted by the transition from α- to β- Mg2SiO4 (olivine to wadsleyite). From the Clapeyron slope, this change is predicted to occur at shallower depths in cold regions, such as where subducting slabs penetrate into the transition zone, and at greater depths in warmer regions, such as where mantle plumes pass through the transition zone.C.M.R. Fowler, The Solid Earth (2nd Edition), Cambridge University Press 2005. Therefore, the exact depth of the \\"410 km discontinuity\\" can vary. ==660 km discontinuity – phase transition== The 660 km discontinuity appears in PP precursors (a wave which reflects off the discontinuity once) only in certain regions but is always apparent in SS precursors. It is seen as single and double reflections in receiver functions for P to S conversions over a broad range of depths (640–720 km, or 397–447 mi). The Clapeyron slope predicts a deeper discontinuity in cold regions and a shallower discontinuity in hot regions. This discontinuity is generally linked to the transition from ringwoodite to bridgmanite and periclase. This is thermodynamically an endothermic reaction and creates a viscosity jump. Both characteristics cause this phase transition to play an important role in geodynamical models. Cold downwelling material might pond on this transition. ==Other discontinuities== There is another major phase transition predicted at 520 km for the transition of olivine (β to γ) and garnet in the pyrolite mantle. This one is only sporadically been observed in seismological data. Other non-global phase transitions have been suggested at a range of depths. ==References== Category:Structure of the Earth ","title":"Transition zone (Earth)"},{"id":"5555740","text":"James J.

Wędrowycz is an antihero, an elderly alcoholic, moonshine producer, poacher, amateur exorcist and fighter against all sorts of supernatural forces dwelling around his village, from aliens to vampires, demons and devils, as well as more mundane threats such as Russian mafia, policemen and tax inspectors. Wędrowycz debuted in a short story published in 1996, and has been featured in dozens of short stories and several book anthologies. With time, Wędrowycz became the most easily recognizable characters of Pilipiuk's speculative fiction and humorous prose, as well as one of the icons of modern Polish pop culture. Many official illustrations of Wędrowycz, particularly for the books, have been done by Polish illustrator . == Fictional character biography == Wędrowycz lives in Stary Majdan, Gmina Wojsławice, in a rural part of Lublin Voivodeship. Born in the 1900s, he has Ukrainian (Cossack) roots. During his youth in the Russian Empire he finished only three classes of elementary school (which he later burned). He has paranormal, spiritual abilities, and is generally described as an exorcist. He is also a moonshine producer and a poacher. The character has been described as == Character analysis == The name \\"Jakub Wędrowycz\\" is a wordplay based on a literal translation of Johnnie Walker into Polish. He is seen in Poland as a combination of popular negative stereotypes and vices of Poles, which nonetheless evokes sympathy. He is an anti-hero. He is also a rebel, mistrustful and often openly defying government and authority figures. ==Reception and significance== Wędrowycz has been described as the most original and easily recognizable characters of Pilipiuk's speculative fiction and humorous prose, as well as one of the icons of modern Polish pop culture. Outside Poland, books featuring Wędrowycz have also been translated into Czech, and have been described as very popular in the Czech Republic. Some Wędrowycz books have also been translated into Russian. Polish writer Jacek Dukaj has written that Wędrowycz is \\"one of the most colorful, original and memorable characters in Polish science fiction and fantasy\\", comparable to Andrzej Sapkowski's Geralt of Rivia, the main character of The Witcher series. Wędrowycz has spawned a collectible card game and a fandom convention, Dni Jakuba Wędrowycza (Days of Jakub Wędrowycz). The card game was released in 2011. The convention has been held in Wojsławice, a village featured in many stories related to Wędrowycz, since 2006. In 2013, during the eighth annual convention, a tall wooden monument of Jakub Wędrowycz was unveiled. In 2019, plans for raising a similar statue of another character from the series, Jakub's friend Semen Korczaszko, were announced. In 2016, a regional branch of PTTK, a Polish tourist organization, created a badge for those who visit local tourist attractions related to the Wędrowycz stories. == Appearances in media == Wędrowycz first appeared in Pilipiuk's debut work, a short story called Hiena (Hyena) in the February 1996 issue of Fenix magazine. His first book appearance was in the 2001 short story collection ' (The Chronicles of Jakub Wędrowycz), the first in a series of several short story collections on the character. As of 2019 there are eight collections of short stories on Wędrowycz published by Pilipiuk: * Kroniki Jakuba Wędrowycza (The Chronicles of Jakub Wędrowycz, 2001) * Czarownik Iwanow (Ivanov the Wizard, 2002) * Weźmisz Czarno kure (Ye Shall Take a Black Hen, 2002) * Zagadka Kuby Rozpruwacza (Mystery of Jack the Ripper, 2004) * Wieszać każdy może (Everyone can hang (someone), 2006) * Homo bimbrownikus (Homo moonshinicus, 2009) * Trucizna (Poison, 2012) * Konan Destylator (Conan The Distiller, 2016) Wędrowycz also makes minor or cameo appearances in a few other stories and books by Pilipiuk.

Route 54 runs from MD 313 in Mardela Springs, Maryland east to DE 1 in Fenwick Island, Delaware. In addition to two segments in which the highway is completely in Delaware and two segments in which the highway is completely in Maryland, Route 54 follows the Delaware/Maryland state line between the twin towns of Delmar, Maryland and Delmar, Delaware and the highway's intersection with MD 353 and DE 26\\\\. One section of the state line portion of Route 54 is maintained by the Delaware Department of Transportation (DelDOT) while three sections of the highway that follow the state line are maintained by the Maryland State Highway Administration (MDSHA). Route 54 was first numbered in two segments in Wicomico County, Maryland in the late 1930s. MD 467 was assigned to the segment around Mardela Springs while MD 455 was assigned to the state line road near Delmar. The Delaware portions of the highway remained unnumbered until the late 1960s, when DelDOT briefly assigned DE 32 to the highway along the southern edge of Sussex County before designating it DE 54\\\\. The Maryland State Roads Commission (now MDSHA) immediately reciprocated by designating its portions MD 54\\\\. Route 54 east of Selbyville has become an important route for seasonal beach traffic headed to and from Fenwick Island and Ocean City, with suburban development lining the road between DE 20 and the eastern terminus. DelDOT has signed DE 54 Alternate (DE 54 Alt.) as an alternate route to the beaches. Improvements have been made to the route west of Fenwick Island, including building a causeway to reduce flooding and adding a center left-turn lane. ==Route description== View east at the west end of Route 54 at MD 313 in Mardela Springs, Maryland Route 54 begins at an intersection with MD 313 in the town of Mardela Springs in Wicomico County, Maryland. MD 313 heads north from the intersection as Sharptown Road and west as a short continuation of Delmar Road west to MD 313's terminus with U.S. Route 50 (US 50, Ocean Gateway). Route 54 heads east as two-lane undivided Delmar Road, passing south of Mardela Middle and High School. The road parallels Barren Creek on the north toward the Delaware state line. After passing the stone marker indicating the intersection of the Transpeninsular Line with the southern end of the Mason-Dixon Line, the highway enters the southwest corner of Sussex County, Delaware, where it intersects Columbia Road. Route 54 continues east until Old Racetrack Road, where the highway turns southeast toward the state line. At the intersection with Waller Road, the state highway begins to follow the state line, with Sussex County, Delaware on the north side of the road and Wicomico County, Maryland on the south, and MDSHA maintenance begins. Route 54 immediately enters the twin towns of Delmar, Delaware and Delmar, Maryland and the highway's name changes to State Street. The highway crosses the Delmarva Central Railroad's Delmarva Subdivision track at-grade south of Highball Signal and meets MD 675 (Bi-State Boulevard), the old alignment of US 13, in the center of the towns. Route 54 continues east to modern US 13, which is known as Sussex Highway in Delaware and Ocean Highway in Maryland. At US 13, the highway leaves Delmar and DelDOT assumes maintenance for the highway. Route 54 westbound at MD 675/Bi-State Boulevard in Delmar. Maryland is on the left side of the road and Delaware is on the right side of the road. Route 54 continues east from US 13 as Line Road through farmland and scattered residences along the state line. At Brittingham Road, maintenance jurisdiction returns to MDSHA. Around the intersection with Whitesville Road, Route 54 dips into Maryland for a short distance, then returns to following the state line until the intersection with MD 353 (Gumboro Road) and DE 26 (Millsboro Highway). At that intersection, Route 54 turns northeast and joins DE 26 in a concurrency. From this point, the highway remains in Delaware. A short distance north of the state line, DE 30 (Whitesville Road) joins the concurrency. In Gumboro, DE 26 and DE 30 continue north while Route 54 turns east onto Cypress Road. Route 54 crosses Bald Cypress Branch and the Pocomoke River, then passes through the Great Cypress Swamp. After crossing the swamp, the highway intersects US 113 on the west edge of the town of Selbyville. Route 54 eastbound along the state line at Brittingham Road, where maintenance changes from DelDOT to MDSHA Route 54 continues east into Selbyville as Cemetery Road and crosses the Snow Hill Line of the Maryland and Delaware Railroad at-grade. The highway turns south into Main Street to pass through the central business district. After intersecting the southern terminus of DE 17 (Bethany Road), Route 54 turns east onto Lighthouse Road. In the hamlet of Bunting, the highway intersects DE 54 Alt. (Bunting Road), an alternate route from Selbyville to the town of Bethany Beach. Route 54 passes through Williamsville and begins to pass beach-related suburban development as the highway crosses Drum Creek and Roy Creek before intersecting the east end of DE 20 (Zion Church Road). Past this intersection, the route gains a center left-turn lane and continues past more development. As the highway approaches the town of Fenwick Island, it becomes two lanes again and crosses two tidal ponds on an elevated causeway before it crosses The Ditch between Assawoman Bay to the south and Little Assawoman Bay to the north. After passing to the north of the Fenwick Island Light, Route 54 reaches its eastern terminus at DE 1 (Coastal Highway) in Fenwick Island, one block west of the Atlantic Ocean and one block north of the town of Ocean City on the other side of the state line. The section of Route 54 east of US 113 in Selbyville serves as a main route to Fenwick Island and sees congestion in the summer months. Route 54 east of US 113 also serves as part of a primary hurricane evacuation route from the Fenwick Island area to points inland while the section of Route 54 between US 13 and US 113 serves as part of a secondary hurricane evacuation route from the coastal areas. Route 54 has an annual average daily traffic count ranging from a high of 15,984 vehicles at the Old Stage Road intersection in Delmar to a low of 812 vehicles at the Cemetery Road intersection west of Selbyville. None of Route 54 is part of the National Highway System. ==History== By 1920, what is now Route 54 in Delaware existed as an unpaved county road. The portion of the current route along Millsboro Highway was proposed as a state highway by 1925. This segment of state highway was completed by 1931, along with the portions from south of Columbia to a point along the state line to the east of Delmar and between Selbyville and Williamsville. A portion of the route along the state line east of Delmar was paved as a county road. On July 1, 1935, the county-maintained portions of the road in Delaware were taken over by the state. By 1936, the roadway was paved between Williamsville and Fenwick Island. A portion of road to the west of Selbyville was paved by 1939. By 1942, the remainder of the road in Delaware between the Maryland border and south of Columbia and Gumboro and Selbyville were paved. The first non-concurrent portions of Route 54 to be numbered were in Maryland in 1939, when MD 467 was marked on the portion around Mardela Springs and MD 455 was marked on the portion around Delmar, which extended from where Waller Road fully enters Maryland east to Brittingham Road. The portion of road between Brittingham Road and MD 353 was county-maintained. MD 455 was extended east from Brittingham Road to DE 26/MD 353 in 1958. In 1968, DE 32 was assigned to the entire highway within Delaware; the Maryland sections were still marked as MD 467 and MD 455. The whole highway was marked as Route 54 in 1969. In addition to the concurrencies with DE 26 and DE 30, Route 54 has been concurrent with DE 20\\\\. DE 20 was extended east of Dagsboro to terminate in Fenwick Island along with Route 54 by 1994. DE 20's eastern terminus was rolled back to its present location in 2005. Despite this, some DE 20 shields are posted along Route 54 between that route's eastern terminus and Fenwick Island. In September 2001, construction began to build an elevated causeway for Route 54 to the west of Fenwick Island in order to prevent flooding from high tides and storms. The project involved building the new causeway to the north of the original alignment, using pre-cast concrete segments. The project, which cost over $15 million, was slated to be finished in August 2003. In 2010, a $10 million project began to add a center left-turn lane along with bike lanes and sidewalks to the portion of Route 54 between DE 20 and Mallard Lakes, a section of road that was targeted for safety improvements due to rapid development; this project was completed in 2012. ==Major intersections== DE 54 officially has a length of and MD 54 officially has a length of . Both of these figures include a overlap between the first and last crossings of the state line. ==Delaware Route 54 Alternate== Delaware Route 54 Alternate (DE 54 Alt.) is an alternate route of DE 54 between Bunting and DE 26 in the town of Bethany Beach. The alternate route heads northeast from DE 54 on two-lane undivided Johnson Road, passing through a mix of farmland and woodland and crossing Dirickson Creek. Upon crossing DE 20, DE 54 Alt. continues north along Bayard Road through more rural areas, crossing Bearhole Ditch and passing through the community of Bayard. The route turns east onto Double Bridges Road and continues northeast through forested areas along with a few residential subdivisions, passing north of the Assawoman Wildlife Area. DE 54 Alt. turns east onto Kent Avenue and crosses the Assawoman Canal, where it curves north and passes residential development before ending at DE 26 at Bethany Beach. DE 54 Alt. was designated by 2006.

It began as a private gaming room where friends could pit their eye hand coordination skills against each other. When the original Katipunan branch opened its doors to the public in January 1997, long queues formed, and soon a loyal customer base grew. By sheer word of mouth, Netopia effortlessly attracts a new wave of faithful clients. Eventually, Netopia Computer Technology (as the company was known then) grew and was bought by ePLDT . Now renamed Digital Paradise Incorporated, the company began a long period of expansion that saw the Netopia brand become the largest Internet café in the Philippines and also the first to open branches in other countries in South East Asia . On June 16, 2006 company president Raymond H. Ricafort stepped down and was replaced by George Tan of ePLDT. ==Products and services== Digital Paradise offers what it calls shared access – the company has built an array of products and services around its primary computer rental business to take advantage of the relatively low penetration of personal computers into the Philippine market.

Merrill (born 1957 in Frankfurt, Germany) is an American political candidate from Maine. Elected as a Democrat to the state legislature, she left the party in 2006 to become an independent candidate for Governor of Maine. Merrill lost to Democratic incumbent John Baldacci who was elected to a second term. She finished in third-place receiving 118,715 votes, or about 21% of all votes cast. Merrill furthered her legal career by working for the Maine law firm Verrill Dana before opening her own legal practice with husband, Phil Merrill. ==Early and childhood years== Merrill was born as Barbara Butler in a U.S. Army hospital in Frankfurt, Germany in 1957. Her father, Charles Butler, was a West Point graduate who served in the Korean War, rose to the rank of Lt. Colonel, and was killed in Vietnam when Merrill was a freshman in high school. Growing up, she lived in Mississippi, Florida, North Carolina, Virginia and Brazil. Her family moved to Maine in time for her to attend Waterville High School and the University of Maine, where she earned a law degree. After working for the law firm of Verrill Dana, she opened her own practice with her husband, Phil Merrill. With Philip, she has two children, Nicholas and Jacqueline. In her practice, she became a lobbyist, working mainly for non-profit organizations, before the state legislature. ==Political career== State representative In 2004, she ran as a Democrat for the Maine House of Representatives in Appleton. She won the general election with over 60% of the vote. After a year and a half as a Democratic member of the legislature, she authored the book Setting the Maine Course: We Can Get There from Here, in which she advocated a variety of new policies, including eliminating both the corporate income tax and economic development tax breaks, dedicating the sales tax to funding public education, having the state pay for teacher pay, increasing environmental regulation, decreasing all other regulation, establishing a \\"rainy day fund\\" to cover budget deficits, and fighting urban sprawl. She says that she wants Maine to be known as \\"the Free Enterprise State.\\" Campaign for governor On January 3, 2006, Merrill announced that she was changing her voter registration to \\"unenrolled,\\" the Maine equivalent of Independent, and leaving the Democratic caucus. This temporarily threw the House into turmoil, as the two major parties became tied in number of members, until Rep. Joanne Twomey, who had left the Democrats the previous November, returned to them, ensuring they would retain a majority. A few days later, in a speech delivered in front of the Charles Butler Army Reserve Center in Saco, Maine, Merrill announced that she would be an Independent candidate for Governor. On May 31, she submitted more than 4,000 valid signatures to the Maine Secretary of State, ensuring that she will receive a place on the ballot. The next day, she submitted proof that she had received 2800 $5 contributions to the Maine Clean Elections Fund, thus qualifying her campaign for partial public funding. During the general election campaign period large expenditures were made by the Republican and Democratic Governors Association: $714,500 by the Republicans to support State Senator Woodcock, the Republican nominee, and $550,000 by the Democrats to support Democrat Baldacci in his reelection bid.http://www.lwvme.org/files/PAC_Basics.pdf Green candidate LaMarche challenged these expenditures as not truly “independent” in a case before the Maine Supreme Court heard on October 31, 2006. The court did not grant LaMarche’s claim. In a related claim, Barbara Merrill challenged the \\"independence\\" of consultant services benefiting the Baldacci campaign before the Maine Commission on Governmental Ethics in a hearing held on October 31, 2006. The Commission did not support Merrill’s claim.http://www.maine.gov/ethics/pdf/meetings/old/20061031minutes.pdf With total campaign expenditures of $915,000, Barbara Merrill received 21.5% of the general election vote. Baldacci was reelected with 38.11% of the vote after spending $1,313,000 in addition to the independent expenditures discussed above. Republican Woodcock received 30.21% of the vote after expending $1,325,000 in addition to independent expenditures. Green candidate LaMarche received 9.5% of the vote after expending $1,127,000. After the election a routine audit of the Merrill campaign raised a question as to whether the Merrill campaign had a conflict of interest and violated the law in hiring the candidate’s husband, Philip Merrill, to produce media and the media buy for the campaign. The issue was addressed at a meeting of the Commission on Governmental Ethics and Election Practices held on July 16, 2007. The Chair, Michael Friedman, Esq, the only non-party member of the Commission, spoke for the majority when he found that “the conflict of interest issue did not have merit.” He said “everyone also seems to agree that the Merrill campaign did not violate any law or rule.” Friedman found the Philip Merrill was a qualified professional and was paid a reasonable sum for his services. Friedman concluded “there was nothing before the Commission in this case that was illegal or unethical.” In the next legislative session, the Maine legislature considered legislation to prohibit hiring members of the candidate’s household to work in Maine campaigns. The Ethics Panel did not support the legislation. The legislature did not pass the ban. Instead the Maine legislature enacted a law requiring that any family member hired by a campaign must be a professional at what they were hired to do and that they could only be paid a reasonable sum for their services. 2007 Chapter Law Chapter 567 Passed in April 2008 amending MRSA Title 21-A Section 1125 sub- sec6-B. The Commission had expressly found the Merrill campaign’s hiring of Philip Merrill met both of these conditions in July 2007 ==Professional career== Barbara Merrill is a veteran advocate for disability-related issues. In 2002, Merrill became the first Executive Director of the Maine Association for Community Service Providers. Then in 2008, Merrill became the Director of Government Relations for the MENTOR Network, a national network of community health and human services providers headquartered in Boston. Beginning in 2012 Merrill was named the Vice President of Public Policy for ANCOR (American Network of Community Options and Resources).

The sense strand is the strand of DNA that has the same sequence as the mRNA, which takes the antisense strand as its template during transcription, and eventually undergoes (typically, not always) translation into a protein. The antisense strand is thus responsible for the RNA that is later translated to protein, while the sense strand possesses a nearly identical makeup to that of the mRNA. Note that for each segment of double stranded DNA, there will possibly be two sets of sense and antisense, depending on which direction one reads (since sense and antisense is relative to perspective). It is ultimately the gene product, or mRNA, that dictates which strand of one segment of dsDNA we call sense or antisense. But keep in mind that sometimes, such as in prokaryotes, overlapping genes on opposite strands means the sense for one mRNA can be the antisense for another mRNA. The immediate product of this transcription is a resultant initial RNA transcript, which contains a sequence of nucleotides that is identical to that of the sense strand. The exception to this is that uracil is used for nucleotide sequencing of RNA molecules rather than thymine. Most eukaryotic RNA transcripts undergo additional editing prior to being translated for protein synthesis. This process typically involves removal of introns from the initial RNA transcript, the addition of a methylated guanine nucleotide cap at the 5' end, and the addition of a poly-A tail at the 3' end. This deletion process is known as splicing. The end product is known as a mature mRNA. Prokaryotic mRNA does not undergo the same process. Strictly speaking, only the mRNA makes \\"sense\\" with the genetic code, as the translated protein peptide sequence can be directly inferred from this strand. The \\"antisense\\" strand of DNA is complementary to the \\"sense\\" strand and is the actual template for mRNA synthesis. Knowing the difference between the sense and antisense strands is important in certain molecular biology applications. For example, in microarray expression technologies, it is important to know which strand is \\"viewed\\" on the array. An array can correspond to either strand; however, a single array will be made entirely of \\"sense\\" or \\"antisense\\" strands. Identifying the different strands is also important in understanding small interfering RNAs, or siRNA. == See also == * Sense (molecular biology) ==References== * Merrill, Dr. Gary F.

He arranged the financing of equity participation by the PNG government through a loan from the International Public Investment Company (IPIC) in Abu Dhabi. This was secured by the shareholding of the PNG government in the Oil Search company. IPIC managed to claim those shares when PNG did not manage to redeem the loan in time. Somare maintains that the project could not have been realized without this financial construction. However, this way of acquiring equity for the PNG state through a secured leverage construction has become controversial and it is one of the main policy issues in PNG.

If a leader is found prima facie in breach of the leadership code, the Ombudsman must refer the case to the Public Prosecutor.

In July 2011, the prosecutor formally lodged 105 allegations of misconduct in office against Somare to the Leadership Tribunal,. Somare is alleged to have misapplied public funds and failed to produce acquittals in 2002, and also failed to submit his annual statements to the Ombudsman Commission in the late 1990s, as required by law. He was in 2011 immediately suspended as Angoram MP. Somare embarked on a string of court cases challenging the referral, but the courts did not find favorable for him.http://www.thenational.com.pg/somare’s-case-to-be-heard- today/11/5/2011;http://www.thenational.com.pg/lenalia-to-head- probe/;http://www.radionz.co.nz/international/pacific-news/202738/png- leadership-tribunal-case-against-arthur-somare-upheld 21/2/2012 In July 2012, he appeared before the tribunal.

Allegations lodged by Morauta against Somare include: his mishandling of a loan to buy equity in Liquid Niugini LNG, an LNG project , leading to a loss of K900 million; the loss of K31 million in bankrupted Lehman Brothers; K200 million owed by Telikom to banks as a result of loans being taken out without the authority of the Treasury; paralysing PNG Power due to a lack of capital; and facilitating a transaction in which K96 million disappeared from the Motor Vehicle Insurance Limited (MVIL), following the sale of MVIL shares in Bank South Pacific.

It leaves a full-width (1 character wide) space before the first character of the person; it can be represented as Unicode character . This is often used in formal writing before using pronouns such as (guì, literally (\\"precious, expensive\\", or \\"noble\\") to show respect.

While it was completely operational, the submarine never saw action before the end of the war, when it was scuttled to prevent its capture by Chilean troops. ==Development== In 1864, a civil engineer of Peruvian nationality, born to a German father and Venezuelan mother, Federico Blume Othon (1831–1901), developed the design of the first submarine for the Peruvian Navy. Blume who participated in the construction of railroads in Peru, presented his idea after the Spanish Pacific squadron occupied the Chincha Islands during the Chincha Islands War. His purpose was to create a device that could confront, with minimum risk, the powerful enemy fleet. The result was Toro Submarino (Submarine Bull). It was a revolutionary design for the ships of those days. She floated and could dive by opening the seacock and filling the ballast tanks. It could also renew the air being submerged using the principle of the snorkel. The war with Spain however came to an end in 1866, and the submarine was not built, but during the war with Chile, Blume once again offered his services to the Peruvian Navy, presenting an improved version of his 1864 submarine. The engineer started to work on his machine in June 1879, only two months after the declaration of war, financing the project with his own resources. The work was carried out in secrecy during four months at a factory property of the Piura–Paita Northern Railroad. The submarine, a cylindrical, iron boiler, bound together by iron strips and rivets, could be operated manually by eight men out of a total crew of eleven who, at the same time, could move the air fans and the water pump. The ventilation tubes were made of brass, and they could be raised or lowered through a special device. Ship instrumentation included internal pressure gauges, depth meter and ballast tank water level. The submarine used an Otto- type gasoline engine for surface running, and electric motors for submerged operations. On October 14, 1879, Blume, together with his son and eight railroad workers, started testing the submarine off the coast of Paita. Testing lasted almost three weeks and proved that the submarine could reach a depth of and a maximum speed of . News about the amazing weapon reached Supreme Director Nicolás de Piérola, who became very enthusiastic about the idea of using it against the Chilean Navy, so preparations were made to show her capability to the authorities. ==Service== The submarine was brought to Callao under the utmost secrecy, hidden in the transport Limeña. In July 1880, Toro Submarino made its first official submersion. Among the passengers was the Peruvian Minister of War. During these maneuvers, the submarine remained submerged for 30 minutes without suffering any damage, proving that it could be used as a reliable weapons platform; the Minister was very impressed. His report to the government about the capabilities of the submarine was favorable, and a decision was made to use it against Chilean warships. The first task conferred upon Toro Submarino was to advance at night towards either of the enemy armored frigates ( or ), which were anchored at the San Lorenzo Island a few kilometers off Callao, towing two torpedoes. The submarine was to deploy under one of the ships and release the torpedoes, which, activated by a time device, would explode and sink the objective. However, as Toro Submarino was preparing to attack and already under of water, the Chileans, informed by their spies of a Peruvian \\"secret and powerful weapon\\", moved their ships to the south and the mission was aborted. On January 16, 1881, after the Battle of Miraflores and at the brink of the occupation of the Peruvian capital, Blume's submarine was scuttled with the other ships of the Peruvian fleet to avoid capture by the enemy. Some naval war analysts still believe that, had Toro Submarino been successful, it would have dramatically changed the course of the war in favor of Peru; however, many modern historians have expressed skepticism about this possibility. ==See also== * History of Peru * History of submarines ==Citations== Category:History of Peru Category:Ships of the War of the Pacific Category:19th-century submarines Category:Submarines of Peru Category:Shipwrecks in the Pacific Ocean Category:Maritime incidents in 1881 Category:Shipwrecks of the War of the Pacific Category:Scuttled vessels of Peru Category:1880 ships ","title":"Toro Submarino"},{"id":"5556073","text":"RealClearPolitics (RCP) is an American political news site and polling data aggregator formed in 2000 by former options trader John McIntyre and former advertising agency account executive Tom Bevan. The site features selected political news stories and op-eds from various news publications in addition to commentary from its own contributors. In 2008, the founders said their goal was to give readers \\"ideological diversity\\" in its commentary section. RCP has been described as right-of-center. The site publishes aggregation of polling data during election seasons. == Origin and philosophy ==  Origin  The web site was founded in 2000 by McIntyre, a former trader at the Chicago Board Options Exchange, and Bevan, a former advertising agency account executive.

However, some statisticians say that it is sometimes misleading to average results from multiple polls. When Nate Silver of rival site FiveThirtyEight claimed RealClearPolitics.com was rigging its averages to favor Senator John McCain and other Republicans, McIntyre denied having a conservative bent, stating, \\"We're running a business. We have no interest in screwing around with that for partisan purposes\\". Silver later backed away from the claim and said the two sites had a friendly rivalry and grudging respect for each other. In 2016, Republicans performed 1.7% better than the final RealClearPolitics average, and Republicans performed 3.3% better than the site's average in 2014.https://realclearpolitics.com/epolls/other/generic_congressional_vote-2170.html In the 2016 presidential election, the final RealClearPolitics average margin overestimated Democrat Hillary Clinton's popular vote performance by 1.3%. The final electoral college prediction map produced by RealClearPolitics predicted that she would narrowly win the election with 272 electoral votes. However, she lost the election to Republican Donald Trump in spite of winning the popular vote. In 2018, the site underestimated the Democratic vote in the 2018 congressional elections by just over one percentage point. == References  External links == * Category:2000 establishments in Illinois Category:American political websites Category:Internet properties established in 2000 Category:News aggregators ","title":"RealClearPolitics"},{"id":"5556077","text":"Eerste River (Eersterivier in Afrikaans, meaning \\"first river\\") is a town in the Western Cape, South Africa and a suburb of the City of Cape Town.

Four Star Playhouse was owned by Four Star International. Its episodes ranged anywhere from surreal mysteries, such as \\"The Man on the Train\\", to light comedies, such as \\"The Lost Silk Hat\\". The original premise was that Charles Boyer, Ida Lupino, David Niven, and Dick Powell would take turns starring in episodes. However, several other performers took the lead from time to time, including Ronald Colman and Joan Fontaine. The show was sponsored in its first bi-weekly season by The Singer Company. Bristol-Myers became an alternate sponsor when it became a weekly series in the fall of 1953 (both sponsors' names alternated as part of the show's title in its initial broadcasts).

It was hosted by longtime film star Dick Powell until his death from lung cancer on January 2, 1963, then by a series of guest hosts (under the revised title The Dick Powell Theater) until the series ended. The first of these hosts was Gregory Peck, who began the January 8 program with a tribute to Powell, recognizing him as \\"a great and good friend to our industry.\\" Peck was followed by fellow actors such as Robert Mitchum, Frank Sinatra, Ronald Reagan, Glenn Ford, Charles Boyer, Jackie Cooper, Rock Hudson, Milton Berle, Jack Lemmon, Dean Martin, Robert Taylor, Steve McQueen, David Niven, Danny Thomas, Robert Wagner, and John Wayne. == Overview == Guest stars for the premiere episode, \\"Who Killed Julie Greer?\\": Standing, from left: Ronald Reagan, Nick Adams, Lloyd Bridges, Mickey Rooney, Edgar Bergen, Jack Carson, Ralph Bellamy, Kay Thompson, Dean Jones, seated, from left, Carolyn Jones and Dick Powell The series was an anthology of various dramas and comedies. It featured many future stars, producers, and directors early in their careers, including Aaron Spelling, Sam Peckinpah, and Bruce Geller. Blake Edwards wrote and directed a number of episodes, including two featuring Robert Vaughn as an Ivy League private eye known as The Boston Terrier. Several episodes, including those featuring The Boston Terrier, doubled as pilots for potential Four Star Television series, including an unsuccessful attempt to revive The Westerner in a modern-day setting, featuring Lee Marvin in Brian Keith's original role. The original pilot episode for Burke's Law (\\"Who Killed Julie Greer?\\"), starring Powell as Amos Burke, appeared as the debut episode of this series, featuring Ronald Reagan (who later went on serve as the Governor of California, and then become the 40th President of the United States). Dick Powell's Zane Grey Theater had run on CBS in the late 1950s, but he switched networks for his last series. The Dick Powell Show was one of the many productions of Four Star Television. The series' theme, \\"More Than Love\\" (\\"Theme from The Dick Powell Show\\") and the majority of musical compositions heard throughout the series were the work of Herschel Burke Gilbert. == References  External links == * * * The Dick Powell Show at CVTA Category:1961 American television series debuts Category:1963 American television series endings Category:1960s American anthology television series Category:Black-and-white American television shows Category:English-language television shows Category:NBC original programming Category:Television series by 20th Century Fox Television Category:Television series by Four Star Television ","title":"The Dick Powell Show"},{"id":"5556150","text":"Yuri Nikolaevich Denisyuk (July 27, 1927 in Sochi — May 14, 2006 in Saint Petersburg) was a Soviet physicist, one of the founders of optical holography. He is known for his great contribution to holography, in particular for the so-called \\"Denisyuk hologram\\". He is a full member of the Russian Academy of Sciences (1992; corresponding member since 1970), doctor of physical and mathematical sciences (1971, candidate of sciences since 1964), professor (1980). ==Biography== Yuri Denisyuk spent his youth in Leningrad and was in the city during the Siege of Leningrad. His scientific work started in 1954 (after his graduation from Saint Petersburg National Research University of Information Technologies, Mechanics and Optics) at Vavilov State Optical Institute. At that time he was inspired by the science fiction novel “Stellar ships” by the Soviet writer and paleontologist Ivan Yefremov (where it was written about a three-dimensional image of alien head emerged in the ancient disc made of unknown material), and remarkable experiments by 1908 Nobel Prize laureate Gabriel Lippmann. In 1958, in other words before the times when lasers with their coherent light were invented, he started conducting his own experiments, where he used lamp emission on mercury vapor and was first to demonstrate 3D hologram. Starting from 1971 Y.N. Denisyuk was the head of the Laboratory of holography at Vavilov State Optical Institute, later he was the head of the whole department, engaged in holographic researches. Since 1988 he has also been the head of the Laboratory of holography at Ioffe Physical- Technical Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences. He published about 240 research papers, which includes 35 inventions. ==Scientific work== Yuri Denisyuk holding a self-portrait hologram. Yuri Denisyuk’s scientific work dealt primarily with physical optics, most notably holography. In 1962 Denisyuk invented the method of image recording in three-dimensional environments allowing one to save information about phase, amplitude, and the spectral structure of the wave coming from an object. These holograms can be produced using a typical beam of white light. This was determined by the government to be a scientific discovery, and was registered with the USSR State Committee on Inventions and Discoveries under №88 as of February 1, 1962 along with the following statement: “The established is an unknown before phenomenon of spatial distortion-free colored image object occurrence under illumination from the three-dimensional element of the transparent material medium, in which the density distribution of matter matches the intensity extension of standing-wave field, which are formed around the object at radiated emission scattering on it” Denisyuk received the Lenin Prize in 1970, upon receipt of the prize he was selected as a member of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR, and appointed as a head of the newly established Laboratory of holography at Vavilov State Optical Institute. He proceeded to study the principles of dynamic holography for which he was awarded the 1982 USSR State Prize. He also participated in the establishment of a system for processing radar impulses using holography for which he was awarded the 1989 USSR State Prize. Denisyuk showed that progressive waves possess reflective properties, solving a problem with holograms formed in experiments with colliding beams. A great deal of his scientific work was dedicated to examination of quasi-deep holograms (the specific one-dimensional structure) and selectograms (a new type of periodic three-dimensional environment). Under Denisyuk’s supervision a range of new light-sensitive materials including reoksan, capillary porous glass, and various composite materials were developed for use as holographic recording media. ==Awards== * The Lenin Prize (1970) * International Film Organization Prize “Intercamera” (1971) * The Order of the Badge of Honour (1975) * The USSR State Prize (1982, 1989) * The International Dennis Gabor Award (1983) * Great Silver Medal and Honorary Member of Royal Photographic Association of Great Britain (1987) * The Order of the Red Banner of Labour (1988) * The R.W.

The idea is to make things better.\\" John Oates has explained that while it is natural to assume the lyrics are about a woman, the song actually was originally written \\"about NYC in the ’80s. It's about greed, avarice, and spoiled riches. But we have it in the setting of a girl because it's more relatable. It's something that people can understand.

He was the first American-born Hasidic rebbe and a champion of Orthodox Jewish outreach, reaching out to many students in the Boston area through his New England Chassidic Center. He was also the founder of ROFEH International, a community-based medical referral and hospitality liaison support agency. ==Family== Horowitz's parents were Rabbi Pinchos Dovid Horowitz and Sora Sosha Horowitz. His father, founder of the Boston Hasidic dynasty, died in November 1941. On 17 November 1942 he married Raichel Unger Leifer of Cleveland, Ohio,The Bostoner Rebbetzin Raichel Horowitz daughter of Rabbi Naftali Unger, av beis din of Neumarkt and a descendant of Rabbi Naftali Tzvi of Ropshitz. ==Communal activism== In 1943, Horowitz was one of the 400-plus rabbis led by Rabbi Baruch Korff who traveled to Washington, D.C. just before Yom Kippur, to plead with President Franklin D. Roosevelt to rescue Jews from Hitler.International Jerusalem Post, January 19–25, 2007, Page 19 The New England Chassidic Center complex on Beacon Street, Brookline, Massachusetts. Upon ascending to the leadership of the Bostoner Hasidim in 1944, after his marriage and ordination at Yeshiva Torah Vodaath, he announced that his primary thrust as rebbe would be aimed at the area's large number of college students, many of whom were away from home and in a perfect position to partake of all that he felt the New England Chassidic Center could offer them. Many tried to dissuade him, saying that Hasidism and college did not mix, but he persevered and was personally responsible for returning many students at Harvard University and Massachusetts Institute of Technology to their Jewish roots. In 1984, Horowitz decided to create a Hasidic community in the Har Nof neighborhood of Jerusalem, establishing Givat Pincus and dividing his time between Israel and Boston. The nascent Bostoner community in Har Nof was instrumental in developing that neighborhood's Orthodox community. In 1999, an additional community was established in Beitar for the next generation of Bostoner Chassidim. Horowitz served as a member of the Moetzes Gedolei HaTorah of Agudath Israel of Israel. At the time of his death, he resided both in the U.S. and in Israel spending half a year in each country. Day-to-day leadership in his community had already passed on to his children.

It is applied specifically to efforts made by governments to reduce crime, enforce the law, and maintain criminal justice. ==Studies== Criminologists, commissions, and research bodies such as the World Health Organization, United Nations, the United States National Research Council, the UK Audit Commission have analyzed their and others' research on what lowers rates of interpersonal crime. They agree that governments must go beyond law enforcement and criminal justice to tackle the risk factors that cause crime because it is more cost effective and leads to greater social benefits than the standard ways of responding to crime. Multiple opinion polls also confirm public support for investment in prevention. Waller uses these materials in Less Law, More Order to propose specific measures to reduce crime as well as a crime bill. The World Health Organization Guide (2004) complements the World Report on Violence and Health (2002) and the 2003 World Health Assembly Resolution 56-24 for governments to implement nine recommendations, which were: # Create, implement and monitor a national action plan for violence prevention. # Enhance capacity for collecting data on violence. # Define priorities for, and support research on, the causes, consequences, costs and prevention of violence. # Promote primary prevention responses. # Strengthen responses for victims of violence. # Integrate violence prevention into social and educational policies, and thereby promote gender and social equality. # Increase collaboration and exchange of information on violence prevention. # Promote and monitor adherence to international treaties, laws and other mechanisms to protect human rights. # Seek practical, internationally agreed responses to the global drugs and global arms trade. The commissions agree on the role of municipalities, because they are best able to organize the strategies to tackle the risk factors that cause crime. The European Forum for Urban Safety and the United States Conference of Mayors have stressed that municipalities must target the programs to meet the needs of youth at risk and women who are vulnerable to violence. To succeed, they need to establish a coalition of key agencies such as schools, job creation, social services, housing and law enforcement around a diagnosis. == Types suggestions for effective crime prevention == Several factors must come together for a crime to occur: # an individual or group must have the desire or motivation to participate in a banned or prohibited behavior; # at least some of the participants must have the skills and tools needed to commit the crime; and, # an opportunity must be acted upon. Primary prevention addresses individual and family-level factors correlated with later criminal participation. Individual level factors such as attachment to school and involvement in pro-social activities decrease the probability of criminal involvement. Family-level factors such as consistent parenting skills similarly reduce individual level risk. Risk factors are additive in nature. The greater the number of risk factors present the greater the risk of criminal involvement. In addition there are initiatives which seek to alter rates of crime at the community or aggregate level. For example, Larry Sherman from the University of Maryland in Policing Domestic Violence (1993) demonstrated that changing the policy of police response to domestic violence calls altered the probability of subsequent violence. Policing hot spots, areas of known criminal activity, decreases the number of criminal events reported to the police in those areas. Other initiatives include community policing efforts to capture known criminals. Organizations such as America's Most Wanted and Crime Stoppers help catch these criminals. Secondary prevention uses intervention techniques that are directed at youth who are at high risk to commit crime, and especially focus on youth who drop out of school or get involved in gangs. It targets social programs and law enforcement at neighborhoods where crime rates are high. Much of the crime that is happening in neighbourhoods with high crime rates is related to social and physical problems. The use of secondary crime prevention in cities such as Birmingham and Bogotá has achieved large reductions in crime and violence. Programs, such as, general social services, educational institutions and the police, are focused on youth who are at risk and have been shown to significantly reduce crime. Tertiary prevention is used after a crime has occurred in order to prevent successive incidents. Such measures can be seen in the implementation of new security policies following acts of terrorism such as the September 11, 2001 attacks. Situational crime prevention uses techniques focusing on reducing on the opportunity to commit a crime. Some of techniques include increasing the difficulty of crime, increasing the risk of crime, and reducing the rewards of crime. ==Situational crime prevention== Introduction and description Situational crime prevention (SCP) is a relatively new concept that employs a preventive approach by focusing on methods to reduce the opportunities for crime. It was first outlined in a 1976 report released by the British Home Office. SCP focuses on the criminal setting and is different from most criminology as it begins with an examination of the circumstances that allow particular types of crime. By gaining an understanding of these circumstances, mechanisms are then introduced to change the relevant environments with the aim of reducing the opportunities for particular crimes. Thus, SCP focuses on crime prevention rather than the punishment or detection of criminals and its intention is to make criminal activities less appealing to offenders. SCP focuses on opportunity-reducing processes that: * Are aimed at particular forms of crime; * Entail the management, creation or manipulation of the immediate environment in as organised and permanent a manner as possible; and * Result in crime being more difficult and risky or less rewarding and justifiable. The theory behind SCP concentrates on the creation of safety mechanisms that assist in protecting people by making criminals feel they may be unable to commit crimes or would be in a situation where they may be caught or detected, which will result in them being unwilling to commit crimes where such mechanisms are in place. The logic behind this is based on the concept of rational choice - that every criminal will assess the situation of a potential crime, weigh up how much they may gain, balance it against how much they may lose and the probability of failing, and then act accordingly. One example of SCP in practice is automated traffic enforcement. Automated traffic enforcement systems (ATES) use automated cameras on the roads to catch drivers who are speeding and those who run red lights. Such systems enjoy use all over the world. These systems have been installed and are advertised as an attempt to keep illegal driving incidences down. As a potential criminal, someone who is about to speed or run a red light knows that their risk of getting caught is nearly 100% with these systems. This completely disincentivizes the person from speeding or running red lights in areas in which they know ATES are set up. Though not conclusive, evidence shows that these type of systems work. In a Philadelphia study, some of the city's most dangerous intersections had a reduction of 96% in red light violations after the installation and advertisement of an ATES system.Page, Benton H., Automated Traffic Enforcement Systems: The Efficacy of Such Systems and Their Effect on Traffic Law, p 13, 2009. http://works.bepress.com/benton_page/1/ ==Applying SCP to information systems (IS)== Situational crime prevention (SCP) in general attempts to move away from the \\"dispositional\\" theories of crime commission i.e. the influence of psychosocial factors or genetic makeup of the criminal, and to focus on those environmental and situational factors that can potentially influence criminal conduct. Hence rather than focus on the criminal, SCP focuses on the circumstances that lend themselves to crime commission. Understanding these circumstances leads to the introduction of measures that alter the environmental factors with the aim of reducing opportunities for criminal behavior. Other aspects of SCP include: # targeting specific forms of crime e.g. cybercrime # aiming to increase the effort and decrease potential risks of crime # reducing provocative phenomenaClarke, R (ed) Situational Crime Prevention: Successful Case Studies (2nd ed.) Harrow and Heston, New York, 1997,  Safeguarding  Another aspect of SCP that is more applicable to the cyber environment is the principle of safeguarding. The introduction of these safeguards is designed to influence the potential offender's view of the risks and benefits of committing the crime. A criminal act is usually performed if the offender decides that there is little or no risk attached to the act. One of the goals of SCP is to implement safeguards to the point where the potential offender views the act unfavourably. For example, if a driver approaches a traffic junction where there are speed cameras, he or she evaluates that there is a nearly 100% chance of being caught trying to run a red light, and hence slows down. The use of crime \\"scripts\\" has been touted as a method of administering safeguards. Scripts were originally developed in the field of cognitive science and focus on the behavioural processes involved in rational goal-oriented behaviour. Hence scripts have been proposed as tool for examining criminal behaviour. In particular the use of what is termed a \\"universal script\\" has been advanced for correctly identifying all the stages in the commission process of a crime.  Application to cybercrimes  It has been suggested that cybercriminals be assessed in terms of their criminal attributes, which include skills, knowledge, resources, access and motives (SKRAM).Parker, D. (1998) Fighting computer crime: A New Framework for protecting Information. Wiley Computer Publishing, New York. Cybercriminals usually have a high degree of these attributes and this is why SCP may prove more useful than traditional approaches to crime. Clarke proposed a table of twenty-five techniques of situational crime prevention, but the five general headings are: # Increasing the effort to commit the crime # Increasing the risks of committing the crime # Reducing the rewards of committing the crime # Reducing any provocation for committing the crime # Removing any excuses for committing the crimeCornish, D. and Clarke, R.

In Theory for Practice in Situational Crime Prevention, Crime Prevention Studies, (Vol 16) M. Smith and D. Cornish, Eds, Criminal Justice Press, New York, 151-196. These techniques can be specifically adapted to cybercrime as follows: Increasing the effort Reinforcing targets and restricting access- the use of firewalls, encryption, card/password access to ID databases and banning hacker websites and magazines. Increasing the risk Reinforcing authentication procedures- background checks for employees with database access, tracking keystrokes of computer users, use of photo and thumb print for ID documents/credit cards, requiring additional ID for online purchases, use of cameras at ATMs and at point of sale. Reducing the rewards Removing targets and disrupting cyberplaces – monitoring Internet sites and incoming spam, harsh penalties for hacking, rapid notification of stolen or lost credit bankcards, avoiding ID numbers on all official documents. Reducing provocation and excuses Avoiding disputes and temptations – maintaining positive employee-management relations and increasing awareness of responsible use policy.Handbook on Crime and Deviance. Edited by Marvin D. Krohn, Alan J. Lizotte and Gina Penly Hall. Springer Science and Business Media, LLC 2009. Many of these techniques do not require a considerable investment in hi-tech IT skills and knowledge. Rather, it is the effective utilization and training of existing personnel that is key. It has been suggested that the theory behind situational crime prevention may also be useful in improving information systems (IS) security by decreasing the rewards criminals may expect from a crime. SCP theory aims to affect the motivation of criminals by means of environmental and situational changes and is based on three elements: * Increasing the perceived difficulty of crime; * Increasing the risks; and * Reducing the rewards.Me G., Spagnoletti P., Situational Crime Prevention and Cyber-crime Investigation: the Online Pedo-pornography Case Study, Eurocon 2005 IS professionals and others who wish to fight computer crime could use the same techniques and consequently reduce the frequency of computer crime that targets the information assets of businesses and organisations. Designing out crime from the environment is a crucial element of SCP and the most efficient way of using computers to fight crime is to predict criminal behaviour, which as a result, makes it difficult for such behaviour to be performed. SCP also has an advantage over other IS measures because it does not focus on crime from the criminal's viewpoint. Many businesses/organisations are heavily dependent on information and communications technology (ICT) and information is a hugely valuable asset due to the accessible data that it provides, which means IS has become increasingly important.Willison R. Siponen M. Overcoming the insider: reducing employee computer crime through Situational Crime Prevention, Communications of the ACM, Vol 52(9), 2009 While storing information in computers enables easy access and sharing by users, computer crime is a considerable threat to such information, whether committed by an external hacker or by an ‘insider’ (a trusted member of a business or organisation).Beebe N.L., Rao V.S., Using Situational Crime Prevention Theory to Explain the Effectiveness of Information Systems, Security, Proceedings of the 2005 SoftWars Conference,, Las Vegas 2005 After viruses, illicit access to and theft of, information form the highest percentage of all financial losses associated with computer crime and security incidents. Businesses need to protect themselves against such illegal or unethical activities, which may be committed via electronic or other methods and IS security technologies are vital in order to protect against amendment, unauthorised disclosure and/or misuse of information. Computer intrusion fraud is a huge business with hackers being able to find passwords, read and alter files and read email, but such crime could almost be eliminated if hackers could be prevented from accessing a computer system or identified quickly enough. Despite many years of computer security research, huge amounts of money being spent on secure operations and an increase in training requirements, there are frequent reports of computer penetrations and data thefts at some of the most heavily protected computer systems in the world.Garfinkel S.L., Inside Risks, The Cybersecurity Risk, Communications of the ACM, Vol 55 (6), p29 - 32, 2012 Criminal activities in cyberspace are increasing with computers being used for numerous illegal activities, including email surveillance, credit card fraud and software piracy.Sukula S.K., Mittal, K.K., Computer crimes and preventive measures in cyber law, Journal of Social Welfare and Management, Vol 2(2), p63 - 70, 2010 As the popularity and growth of the Internet continues to increase, many web applications and services are being set up, which are widely used by businesses for their business transactions.Thakar U., Dagdee N., Varma S., Pattern Analysis and Signature Extraction for Intrusion Attacks on Web Services, International Journal of Network Security and Its Applications, Vol 2(3), p190 - 205, 2010 In the case of computer crime, even cautious companies or businesses that aim to create effective and comprehensive security measures may unintentionally produce an environment, which helps provide opportunities because they are using inappropriate controls.Willison R., Backhouse J., Opportunities for computer crime: considering systems risk from a criminological perspective, European Journal of Information Systems, Vol 15, p 403 - 414, 2006 Consequently, if the precautions are not providing an adequate level of security, the IS will be at risk.  Application to sexual abuse  Smallbone et al.’s Integrated Theory of Child Sexual Abuse posits that it can be useful to study child sexual abuse as a situationally specific incident, and that on any particular occasion, a variety of different factors can influence whether that incident is likely to occur. One set of factors is situational factors, which form the immediate backdrop to the setting in which the abuse takes place. Situational factors, it is argued, can influence not just whether a person abuses a child, but whether the idea of abusing occurs to them in the first place. The particular opportunities and dynamics of a situation are said to present cues, stressors, temptations and perceived provocations, which trigger motivation. The consideration of situational factors leads to the argument that some offenders may be considered as ‘situational’, marking them out from other types. The ‘situational offender’ is someone who is not primarily attracted to children. Instead, he is stimulated to offend by specific behavioural cues or stressors, often while performing care-giving duties. The authors of the theory argue that modifying the situations experienced by children, through situational crime prevention strategies, could lower the likelihood of abuse, irrespective of the disposition of people who are likely to come into contact with children. The authors concede that there has been little testing of situational interventions, which means there is little evidence to demonstrate their effectiveness. An evaluation of a programme which worked work mothers in London to reduce situational risk of child sexual abuse in the home illustrated some of the challenges that mothers faced in identifying and reducing situational risk: # Increasing understanding about abuse, how and where it happens. # Accepting the possibility of abuse at home and in the family. # Accurately assessing the risks posed to one's own children. # Lowering known risks by negotiating with family members. Situational crime prevention and fraud In computer systems that have been developed to design out crime from the environment, one of the tactics used is risk assessment, where business transactions, clients and situations are monitored for any features that indicate a risk of criminal activity. Credit card fraud has been one of the most complex crimes worldwide in recent times and despite numerous prevention initiatives, it is clear that more needs to be done if the problem is to be solved. Fraud management comprises a whole range of activities, including early warning systems, signs and patterns of different types of fraud, profiles of users and their activities, security of computers and avoiding customer dissatisfaction. There are a number of issues that make the development of fraud management systems an extremely difficult and challenging task, including the huge volume of data involved; the requirement for fast and accurate fraud detection without inconveniencing business operations; the ongoing development of new fraud to evade existing techniques; and the risk of false alarms. Generally, fraud detection techniques fall into two categories: statistical techniques and artificial intelligence techniques. Important statistical data analysis techniques to detect fraud include: * Grouping and classification to determine patterns and associations among sets of data. * Matching algorithms to identify irregularities in the transactions of users compared to previous proof * Data pre-processing techniques for validation, correction of errors and estimating incorrect or missing data. Important AI techniques for fraud management are: * Data mining – to categorise and group data and automatically identify associations and rules that may be indicative of remarkable patterns, including those connected to fraud. * Specialist systems to programme expertise for fraud detection in the shape of rules. * Pattern recognition to identify groups or patterns of behaviour either automatically or to match certain inputs. * Machine learning techniques to automatically detect the characteristics of fraud * Neural networks that can learn suspicious patterns and later identify them.Palshikar G.K., The Hidden Truth: data analysis can be a strategic weapon in your company’s management and control of fraud, Intelligent Enterprise 2002 ==Applications== Neighborhoods can implement protective strategies to reduce violent crime. The broken windows theory of crime suggests that disorderly neighborhoods can promote crime by showing they have inadequate social control. Some studies have indicated that modifying the built environment can reduce violent crime. This includes deconcentrating high-rise public housing, making zoning changes, restricting the number of liquor licenses available in an area, and keeping vacant lots and buildings maintained and secure. ==See also== * Crime displacement * Predictive policing ==NotesBibliography== * Audit Commission, Misspent youth: Young people and crime, London: Audit Commission for Local Authorities and NHS in England and Wales, 1996 * Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary, Beating crime, London: Home Office, 1998 * Home Office, Reducing offending: An assessment of research evidence on ways of dealing with offending behaviour, edited by Peter Goldblatt and Chris Lewis.

The trp operon is present in many bacteria, but was first characterized in Escherichia coli. The operon is regulated so that, when tryptophan is present in the environment, the genes for tryptophan synthesis are not expressed. It was an important experimental system for learning about gene regulation, and is commonly used to teach gene regulation. Trp operon contains five structural genes: trpE, trpD, trpC, trpB, and trpA, which encode enzymatic parts of the pathway. It also contains a repressive regulator gene called trpR. trpR has a promoter where RNA polymerase binds and synthesizes mRNA for a regulatory protein. The protein that is synthesized by trpR then binds to the operator which then causes the transcription to be blocked. In the trp operon, tryptophan binds to the repressor protein effectively blocking gene transcription. In this situation, repression is that of RNA polymerase transcribing the genes in the operon. Also unlike the lac operon, the trp operon contains a leader peptide and an attenuator sequence which allows for graded regulation. It is an example of repressible negative regulation of gene expression. Within the operon's regulatory sequence, the operator is bound to the repressor protein in the presence of tryptophan (thereby preventing transcription) and is liberated in tryptophan's absence (thereby allowing transcription). == Genes == Trp operon contains five structural genes. Their roles are: * TrpE (): Anthranilate synthase produces anthranilate. * TrpD (): Cooperates with TrpE. * TrpC (): Phosphoribosylanthranilate isomerase domain first turns N-(5-phospho-β-D-ribosyl)anthranilate into 1-(2-carboxyphenylamino)-1-deoxy-D-ribulose 5-phosphate. The Indole-3-glycerol-phosphate synthase on the same protein then turns the product into (1S,2R)-1-C-(indol-3-yl)glycerol 3-phosphate. * TrpA (), TrpB (): two subunits of tryptophan synthetase. Combines TrpC's product with serine to produce tryptophan. == Repression == Trp repressor dimer bound to operator DNA The operon operates by a negative repressible feedback mechanism. The repressor for the trp operon is produced upstream by the trpR gene, which is constitutively expressed at a low level. Synthesized trpR monomers associate into dimers. When tryptophan is present, these tryptophan repressor dimers bind to tryptophan, causing a change in the repressor conformation, allowing the repressor to bind to the operator. This prevents RNA polymerase from binding to and transcribing the operon, so tryptophan is not produced from its precursor. When tryptophan is not present, the repressor is in its inactive conformation and cannot bind the operator region, so transcription is not inhibited by the repressor. == Attenuation == Mechanism of transcriptional attenuation of the trp operon. Attenuation is a second mechanism of negative feedback in the trp operon. The repression system targets the intracellular trp concentration whereas the attenuation responds to the concentration of charged tRNAtrp. Thus, the trpR repressor decreases gene expression by altering the initiation of transcription, while attenuation does so by altering the process of transcription that's already in progress. While the TrpR repressor decreases transcription by a factor of 70, attenuation can further decrease it by a factor of 10, thus allowing accumulated repression of about 700-fold. Attenuation is made possible by the fact that in prokaryotes (which have no nucleus), the ribosomes begin translating the mRNA while RNA polymerase is still transcribing the DNA sequence. This allows the process of translation to affect transcription of the operon directly. At the beginning of the transcribed genes of the trp operon is a sequence of at least 130 nucleotides termed the leader transcript (trpL; ). Lee and Yanofsky (1977) found that the attenuation efficiency is correlated with the stability of a secondary structure embedded in trpL, and the 2 constituent hairpins of the terminator structure were later elucidated by Oxender et al. (1979). This transcript includes four short sequences designated 1–4, each of which is partially complementary to the next one. Thus, three distinct secondary structures (hairpins) can form: 1–2, 2–3 or 3–4. The hybridization of sequences 1 and 2 to form the 1–2 structure is rare because the RNA polymerase waits for a ribosome to attach before continuing transcription past sequence 1, however if the 1–2 hairpin were to form it would prevent the formation of the 2–3 structure (but not 3–4). The formation of a hairpin loop between sequences 2–3 prevents the formation of hairpin loops between both 1–2 and 3–4. The 3–4 structure is a transcription termination sequence (abundant in G/C and immediately followed by several uracil residues), once it forms RNA polymerase will disassociate from the DNA and transcription of the structural genes of the operon can not occur (see below for a more detailed explanation). The functional importance of the 2nd hairpin for the transcriptional termination is illustrated by the reduced transcription termination frequency observed in experiments destabilizing the central G+C pairing of this hairpin. Part of the leader transcript codes for a short polypeptide of 14 amino acids, termed the leader peptide. This peptide contains two adjacent tryptophan residues, which is unusual, since tryptophan is a fairly uncommon amino acid (about one in a hundred residues in a typical E. coli protein is tryptophan). The strand 1 in trpL encompasses the region encoding the trailing residues of the leader peptide: Trp, Trp, Arg, Thr, Ser; conservation is observed in these 5 codons whereas mutating the upstream codons do not alter the operon expression. If the ribosome attempts to translate this peptide while tryptophan levels in the cell are low, it will stall at either of the two trp codons. While it is stalled, the ribosome physically shields sequence 1 of the transcript, preventing the formation of the 1–2 secondary structure. Sequence 2 is then free to hybridize with sequence 3 to form the 2–3 structure, which then prevents the formation of the 3–4 termination hairpin, which is why the 2–3 structure is called an anti-termination hairpin. In the presence of the 2–3 structure, RNA polymerase is free to continue transcribing the operon. Mutational analysis and studies involving complementary oligonucleotides demonstrate that the stability of the 2–3 structure corresponds to the operon expression level. If tryptophan levels in the cell are high, the ribosome will translate the entire leader peptide without interruption and will only stall during translation termination at the stop codon. At this point the ribosome physically shields both sequences 1 and 2. Sequences 3 and 4 are thus free to form the 3–4 structure which terminates transcription. This terminator structure forms when no ribosome stalls in the vicinity of the Trp tandem (i.e. Trp or Arg codon): either the leader peptide is not translated or the translation proceeds smoothly along the strand 1 with abundant charged tRNAtrp. More over, the ribosome is proposed to only block about 10 nts downstream, thus ribosome stalling in either the upstream Gly or further downstream Thr do not seem to affect the formation of the termination hairpin. The end result is that the operon will be transcribed only when tryptophan is unavailable for the ribosome, while the trpL transcript is constitutively expressed. This attenuation mechanism is experimentally supported. First, the translation of the leader peptide and ribosomal stalling are directly evidenced to be necessary for inhibiting the transcription termination. Moreover, mutational analysis destabilizing or disrupting the base-pairing of the antiterminator hairpin results in increased termination of several folds; consistent with the attenuation model, this mutation fails to relieve attenuation even with starved Trp. In contrast, complementary oligonucleotides targeting strand 1 increases the operon expression by promoting the antiterminator formation. Furthermore, in histidine operon, compensatory mutation shows that the pairing ability of strands 2–3 matters more than their primary sequence in inhibiting attenuation. In attenuation, where the translating ribosome is stalled determines whether the termination hairpin will be formed. In order for the transcribing polymerase to concomitantly capture the alternative structure, the time scale of the structural modulation must be comparable to that of the transcription. To ensure that the ribosome binds and begins translation of the leader transcript immediately following its synthesis, a pause site exists in the trpL sequence. Upon reaching this site, RNA polymerase pauses transcription and apparently waits for translation to begin. This mechanism allows for synchronization of transcription and translation, a key element in attenuation. A similar attenuation mechanism regulates the synthesis of histidine, phenylalanine and threonine. == Regulation of trp operon in Bacillus subtilis == Trp operon genes are arranged in the same order in E. coli and Bacillus subtilis. Regulation of trp operons in both organisms depends on the amount of trp present in the cell. However, the primary regulation of tryptophan biosynthesis in B. subtilis is via attenuation, rather than repression, of transcription. In B. subtilis, tryptophan binds to the eleven-subunit tryptophan-activated RNA-binding attenuation protein (TRAP), which activates TRAP's ability to bind to the trp leader RNA. Binding of trp-activated TRAP to leader RNA results in the formation of a terminator structure that causes transcription termination. == References  Further reading == * * == External links == *Animation of the Trp operon's regulation Category:Gene expression Category:Operons ","title":"Trp operon"},{"id":"5556208","text":"\\"Wohin, kleines Pony?\\" (English translation: \\"Where to, Little Pony?\\") was Austria's debut entry in the Eurovision Song Contest, performed in German by Bob Martin.

It is situated in Table Bay. Because of its position along one of the world's busiest trade routes it is one of the busiest ports in South Africa, handling the largest amount of fresh fruit and second only to Durban as a container port. The port also has significant repair and maintenance facilities that are used by several large fishing fleets and parts of the West African oil industry. Because of the many tourist attractions offered by Cape Town and its surrounding region, many cruise ships also berth in the port. ==History== The history of the port follows that of Cape Town, which traces its roots back to 6 April 1652 when Jan van Riebeeck of the Dutch East India Company (VOC) established a revictualing station there. Earlier explorers had called it Table Bay from the late 15th century onwards. The first harbour construction was a jetty built in 1654 by van Riebeeck. Ships all anchored in the bay, and goods were transferred to and from the shore by smaller vessels. Table Bay is notorious for violent winter storms, when the wind blows on to a lee shore. Massive shipping losses were sustained by the Dutch Vereenigde OstIndische Companje, to the extent that eventually Table Bay was closed during the winter months, and ships were ordered to use Simon's Bay (part of False Bay, where Simon's Town is now) in winter. A vicious storm in 1858, long after the demise of the VOC, saw 30 ships blown ashore and wrecked, with huge loss of life. Lloyd's of London declined all further insurance on ships in Table Bay in winter, resulting in the British Colonial Government starting the construction, in 1860, of the first breakwater. This developed into the Victoria and Alfred Basin, the first safe harbour. There has been extensive expansion since then. ==Main areas== The port evolved greatly over the centuries and currently consists of several main components: * The Ben Schoeman Dock: This is the larger outer dock of the port, where the container terminal is situated. * The Duncan Dock: This is the smaller and the older inner dock, containing the multi-purpose and fruit terminals as well as a dry dock, repair quay and tanker basin. * The yachting marina. * The Victoria and Alfred Basins: These were the main piers of the original Cape Town harbour, but now house the Victoria & Alfred Waterfront. However, these basins are still used by smaller commercial vessels such as fishing and pleasure boats and also by smaller passenger cruise ships. ==Port operations== The port is open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. All vessels berthing in the port require a pilot on board. Transfer is by pilot boat but plans have been made to introduce a helicopter transfer service. Several tugs, launches, workboats and other specialised vessels are operated by the port. During the 2005/06 financial year, the Port of Cape Town handled 3,400 vessels for a gross tonnage of 48,778,963-gt. Total cargo handled at the port (excluding containers) was 3,718,005 tonnes; container tonnage is estimated at 9.948 million tonnes. In 2010, the port handled 719,825 TEU. On 30 June, 2020, Transnet introduced a number of solutions to deal with operational backlogs at the Port of Cape Town, caused by the COVID-19 pandemic in the region. ==See also== * List of ports of entry in South Africa ==ReferencesExternal links== * Official website Category:Transport in Cape Town Cape Town ","title":"Port of Cape Town"},{"id":"5556212","text":"The MG L-type is a sports car that was produced by the MG Car company in 1933 and 1934.

It was previously fitted in the 1930 Wolseley Hornet and the 1931 MG F-type Magna. Drive was to the rear wheels through a four-speed non-synchromesh gearbox. The chassis was a narrower version of that used in the K-type with suspension by half-elliptic springs all round with rigid front and rear axles. The car had a wheelbase of 94 inches (2388 mm) and a track of 42 inches (1067 mm). The brakes, which were the same as in the J2, were cable-operated, with drums all round. The body kept the sloping radiator seen on the F-Type, but the car now had sweeping wings, and the four-seater had cut-away doors. The L1 was the four-seat, coupé and saloon version and the L2 the 2-seater. The coupé, or Continental Coupé as it was called, was available in some very striking two-tone colours but was a slow seller, and the 100 that were made were available for a long time after the rest of the range had sold out. As a rarity, it is now a highly desirable car. The bodies for the small saloon or salonette version were not made by MG, but bought in from Abbey. The L-Type was a successful competition car, with victories in the 1933 Alpine Trial and Brooklands relay race.

He is mostly known for his \\"metal top\\" electric guitars, which were used by some notable rock musicians of that era. Under the leadership of his son Tony Zemaitis, Jr., Zemaitis Guitars company continued this guitar-making style after the luthier's death in 2002. == Early years == Metal Front guitar Zemaitis (born as Antanas Kazimeras Žemaitis) was born 1935 in London, England of Lithuanian family and left school at the age of sixteen to help out with family finances. He took up a five-year apprenticeship as a cabinet maker, but it was only when he found an old damaged guitar in his family attic that he found his real passion in life. After completing his national service, Zemaitis expanded this hobby in 1957 by producing a few basic guitars to learn about construction, soundhole shapes, tonewood, and string length. He experimented with differing multi-stringed instruments with some of these models making their way onto the folk scene. In 1960 he began selling his guitars at a price to cover the materials he used and soon realized that musicians needed simple instruments and light. By 1961, after being mentioned in the music press, Zemaitis started to be approached by leading players who wanted to use his guitars. ==1970s: fame== Keith Richards playing a Zemaitis guitar in 1975. In 1970 Zemaitis started experimenting with placing a metal shield on the top of the guitar to eliminate microphonic noise picked up by the guitars' pickups. His first metal top guitar prototype was purchased by Tony McPhee, while the second was for Ronnie Wood of Rolling Stones fame (he was in the Faces at the time). Wood played the instrument on The Faces' Top of the Pops appearance in 1971, and the shiny appearance of the guitar raised an incredible amount of interest from guitar players. Zemaitis asked gun engraver Danny O'Brien to do artistic engravings on the metal top and other metal parts and started building custom-order guitars for the rich and famous. His most famous guitars are Ronnie Wood's 24-fret metal top guitars (a total of four guitars were built for Wood), which he used from 1971 until 1995, Ronnie Wood's \\"Desert Island\\" (or \\"Slide on This\\") metal disc top guitar, Keith Richards' 5-string \\"Skull&Bones;\\" guitar, Eric Clapton's \\"Ivan the Terrible\\" 12-string acoustic guitar, various acoustics and resonators for George Harrison and basses and resonator for Ronnie Lane. In 1978, he made a unique acoustic bass for David Gilmour of Pink Floyd. Aside from metal top guitars, from the mid-70s Zemaitis also started decorating the tops of his guitars with elaborate pearl inlay, either figures like dragons and skulls and bones or complete mosaic-like inlaid tops. These guitars command the highest prices. ==1980s== Example of a Zemaitis \\"Student model\\". In the 1980s Zemaitis launched a \\"student model\\" guitar that would allow people to upgrade his guitar when it was affordable but this proved too popular and time-consuming. He quickly realized that this model threatened to overshadow all other guitar production so it was discontinued. The 1980s were also a time when Zemaitis started to take more orders for guitars than was physically possible to produce and he had to start turning down work. ==1990s== Zemaitis \\"Disc\\" guitar, a close copy of the original model built for and used by Ron Wood. The 1990s saw a massive increase in the collectability of Zemaitis' guitars and the appearance of forgeries. These forgeries in \\"new\\" and \\"second hand\\" guise at first glance may look genuine but they will not sound like a true Zemaitis due to the use of second-rate materials. During his 39 years of production, Zemaitis had a policy of never making any two guitars the same, while at the same time limiting himself to the production of only ten guitars a year to ensure the quality of each model. ==2000s== Zemaitis retired in 2000 and died two years later. Zemaitis Guitars of Tokyo, Japan, has continued the Zemaitis guitar-making style. Led by Tony Zemaitis, Jr., the company has continued to employ O'Brien as an engraver. In 2007, American economist-turned-fraudster Al Parish bought an acoustic guitar owned by George Harrison and made by Zemaitis for $150,000. == See also == * Zemaitis Guitars ==References== Category:Guitar makers Category:1935 births Category:2002 deaths Category:English people of Lithuanian descent Category:Luthiers ","title":"Tony Zemaitis"},{"id":"5556307","text":"Dutch author Halil Gür in the Vondelpark, Amsterdam 2014.

Ebertstraße is on the left, running northwards, along the eastern edge of the Tiergarten, up to the Brandenburg Gate, visible near the Reichstag (top left corner). Just below the Brandenburg Gate the new United States Embassy is under construction. The Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe, with its 2,711 slabs, occupies the centre of the picture, and at the bottom are new office buildings in the Ministergarten. This was roughly the location of the mammoth stage for Roger Waters' The Wall concert on 21 July 1990. Ebertstraße is a street in Berlin, the capital of Germany. It runs on a roughly north-south line from the Brandenburg Gate to Potsdamer Platz in the centre of the city. As one heads south down Ebertstraße, the Tiergarten, a large forested park, is to one's right, and the new United States Embassy to the left. Across the corner of Behrenstraße on the left is the Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe. Beyond that is the Ministergarten, which was once the gardens at the rear of the old Foreign Office building in Wilhelmstraße, and now the location of numerous modern office buildings. At the southern end of the street, past the corner of Lennéstraße on the right, is the new entertainment precinct around the rebuilt Potsdamer Platz. Looking north up Ebertstraße from the corner of Voßstraße. The buildings are part of the Beisheim Center in the new Potsdamer Platz development. The street follows the line of the walls of the mediaeval Prussian fortress town of Berlin, linking the Brandenburg Gate with the Potsdam Gate, which stood where Potsdamer Platz now is. After the demolition of the walls it was laid out as a street. Following the Austro-Prussian War in 1866, it was named Königgrätzer Straße in honour of the Prussian victory over Austria at the Battle of Königgrätz. After World War I, this name was considered unsuitably militaristic, and the street was renamed \\"Budapester Straße\\" (the street south of the Tiergarten now called Budapester Straße was at that time an eastwards continuation of the Kurfürstendamm). After the death of the first President of the Weimar Republic, Friedrich Ebert, in 1925, it was renamed Ebertstraße in 1930, but in 1935, under the Nazi regime, it was called Hermann-Göring-Straße, after Reichsmarschall Hermann Göring, whose official residence was close by. In the mid-1930s almost the entire street was dug up for the building of the S-Bahn \\"north-south link\\" line from Unter den Linden to Yorckstraße, via Potsdamer Platz and Anhalter Bahnhof. The idea for such a link had first been mooted in 1914, but detailed plans were not drawn up until 1928, and then approval had to wait until 1933. Construction began in 1934, but determination to have it finished in time for the Berlin Olympic Games in 1936 meant safety measures were ignored: on 20 August 1935 a tunnel collapse just south of the Brandenburg Gate buried twenty-three workmen of whom only four survived; then on 28 December 1936 a fire near Potsdamer Platz station destroyed vital equipment. The section did not finally open until 15 April 1939. On 31 July 1947, after World War II, the street was renamed back to Ebertstraße. From 1961 to 1989 the Berlin Wall ran along most of its length. ==External links== *Photos of prewar Ebertstraße *road map *aerial photo Category:Streets in Berlin ","title":"Ebertstraße"},{"id":"5556324","text":"Early general elections were held in Barbados on 6 September 1994.Dieter Nohlen (2005) Elections in the Americas: A data handbook, Volume I, p90 The result was a victory for the opposition Barbados Labour Party, which won 19 of the 28 seats, with its leader Owen Arthur becoming Prime Minister.

The garden is triangular in shape, and is bounded by Santa Fe Avenue, Las Heras Avenue and República Árabe Siria Street. The garden, which was declared a national monument in 1996, has a total area of , and holds approximately 5,500 species of plants, trees and shrubs, as well as a number of sculptures, monuments and five greenhouses. ==Origin== Designed by French architect and landscape designer Carlos Thays, the garden was inaugurated on September 7, 1898. Thays and his family lived in an English style mansion, located within the gardens, between 1892 and 1898, when he served as director of parks and walks in the city. The mansion, built in 1881, is currently the main building of the complex. ==Collections== The park has three distinct landscape gardening styles; the symmetric, the mixed and the picturesque, recreated in the Roman, French and Oriental gardens. Roman garden :This holds species of tree that the first century Roman botanist Pliny the Younger had in his villa in the Apennine mountains, such as cypresses, poplars, and laurels. French garden :This has a symmetric French style of the 17th and 18th century. Oriental garden :In other areas the plants are ordered by origin; from Asia can be seen Ginkgo biloba; from Oceania Acacias, Eucalyptus and Casuarinas; from Europe oaks and hazelnut trees; from Africa brackens and palms. Argentinean Indigenous Americas garden There are an abundant collection of flora from Argentina and the Southern Cone present in the design, such as Araucaria and Blue Patagonian Spruce, and evergreen trees. In other sections plant species are systematically ordered by their taxonomic qualification. There are also other plantae from the Americas, such as sequoias from United States and \\"Palo Borracho\\" Chorisia speciosa, also called Floss silk tree from Brazil and Northern Argentina. ==Installations== Greenhouse. Within the garden is the Municipal Gardening School Cristóbal María Hicken, which is linked to the Faculty of Agronomy of the University of Buenos Aires. The garden also contains 33 artistic works including sculptures, busts and monuments. Among these are Los primeros Fríos by the Catalan sculptor Blay y Fábregas, Sagunto by Querol y Subirats, Figura de mujer by Lola Mora, and Saturnalia made in bronze by Ernesto Biondi. Other attractions include the five winter-houses, the biggest of which is in Art Nouveau style and received recognition in the Paris Universal Exhibition in 1889. It has a length of , a width of , contains 2500 tropical plants and is considered to be the only winter-house in that style still conserved in the world. There is also a monument entitled Indicador Meteorológico (Weather Indicator), designed by José Markovich, and presented by the Austro-Hungarian Empire community for the Exposición Internacional del Centenario (1910). The Botanic Library has 1,000 books and 10,000 publications from all parts of the world, which are freely available to visitors. The park also contains a Botanical Museum. ==Cat population== In recent years, the Botanical Garden has become home to a large population of cats. The cats are not feral animals born in the Garden, but are all domestic cats abandoned there by owners who wished for unknown reasons to get rid of their household cats. Garden authorities and security personnel have so far been unable to check the regular abandonment of unwanted household cats. Projects to remove the cats have been rejected due to objection from neighbors and animal protection agencies. Removal of the existing cats would not solve the problem of the cat population in the Garden, since, in summer, abandonment rates are as high as one cat per day. Thanks to the dedication of volunteers in the animal protection community who formed a voluntary committee, a humane temporary solution became possible. Cats are allowed to live in the Garden; the volunteer committee feeds the cats, puts them up for adoption and provides vaccines and veterinary care for them, and organizes castration operatives, sometimes with the cooperation of Instituto de Zoonosis Luis Pasteur. ==Gallery== File:Buenos Aires Jardin Botanico Carlos Thays 00.jpg File:Buenos Aires Jardin Botanico Carlos Thays 02.jpg File:Indicador Meteorológico.jpg File:Blay Fabregas, los primeros frios 2.jpg File:2019 Buenos Aires - El despertar de la naturaleza, estatua de Juan de Pari.jpg File:Escultura Saturnalia de Ernesto Biondi.jpg ==See also== * Botany ==ReferencesBibliography== *Mimi Böhm – Buenos Aires, Art Nouveau - Ediciones Xavier Verstraeten - Buenos Aires, (2005) * Armando T.

The LaserJet 4, especially the 4/4M/4+/4M+ models, have become known for their durability, mainly due to their reliable construction, as well as the printers built-in PCL (and optional PostScript) printer language support which is still used in computers to this day. Hewlett Packard dominated the laser printing sector during this time in part due to their reliability, relatively affordable pricing, and the spread of LaserJet 4 models from personal use up to heavy business use.Printer Works - BX Engine (Accessed June 14, 2006) The LaserJet 4 series was discontinued in the 1990s, and Hewlett Packard recommended the HP LaserJet 5 series as a replacement for the 4 series. However the driver for the HP LaserJet 4 exists in most, even older, software products and is a popular substitute driver for other PCL compatible printers. == Straight Paper Feed == A feature of the 4Si particularly dear to graphic designers was the straight paper feed. Unusually thick paper could be run through the printers without jamming by setting the output tray to \\"Lower (face up)\\" and having it come out the back of the printer. (Note: This is not a feature of the original 1992 Laserjet 4.) Similar models of earlier HP laser printers had this feature, but it became less common with the later models. == Common problems == The EX (and EX+) print engine is known for its reliability and longevity, and in comparison to earlier generations of laser printers, these machines have acquired a 'workhorse' reputation. The engine has a high monthly duty cycle (20,000 pages) and it is not uncommon to find units still functioning well after a million or more page impressions. However, any printer mechanism is subject to wear and degeneration, and typically printers still in use have now seen long service (the machine being discontinued with the introduction of the Laserjet 5 in 1995).  Exit path jams  Printers that exhibit the \\"accordion\\" or \\"washboard\\" paper jam problem with the paper tightly concertinaed or folded in the exit paper path (often behind the rear access door) generally have problems with the paper exit mechanism. In many cases, the delivery rollers (upper and lower) in the upper or final stage of the paper exit are worn or unserviceable. Replacement kits for these rollers are easily obtainable and can solve the problem. An alternative is to enlarge the roller slightly by using heat shrink over the output rollers. The heat shrink extra diameter pulls the paper quicker and resolves the wear/slip issues. Another alternative is to use coarse quality abrasive paper such as those used by belt sanders to roughen the surfaces of the rollers. A quality abrasive is needed to ensure no particles are shed into the mechanism. == Models == 4/4M Introduced in 1992, this is the original LaserJet 4 with the Canon EX laser print engine. It prints eight pages per minute, and the user cannot extend the feeders. 4+/4M+ The LaserJet 4 Plus (4+), released in 1994, was the LaserJet 4 with the improved Canon EX+ engine which increased printing speed to 12 PPM.Printer Works - LaserJet 4 Information (Accessed June 14, 2006) This also provided the option for duplex printing (automatic double- sided printing) with the purchase of an accessory (HP part number C3157A). The original 20 MHz processor was also upgraded to 25 MHz, with the addition of Hewlett Packard's Memory Enhancement Technology.Windows Magazine - Top 100 best products of 1995 (Accessed June 14, 2006, unavailable Sep 2009]) The printing mechanism was also improved to allow increased tones of grayscale.Twenty Years of Innovation: HP LaserJet and Inkjet Printers 1984–2004 (PDF) (Accessed July 16, 2019) These models also feature a 20-30W power saving (stand-by) mode, which was not included in the original Laserjet 4. 4Si The 4Si (and 4Si MX for the Macintosh) were heavy-duty business printers, produced using the Canon NX engine.Printer Works - 4Si (Accessed June 14, 2006) The 4Si worked at 17 PPM, could print on paper up to 8.5\\"x14\\", and could be upgraded with a duplexing unit and an envelope feeder. Besides the usual malfunctions common to laser printers with worn rollers or accumulated paper dust, older IIISi and 4Si printers eventually exhibit a \\"phantom paper jam.\\" On longer documents, the printer will stop and report a paper jam, but with no visible reason why the paper wasn't feeding correctly. There are a couple of solenoids at the paper tray input mechanism that have felt pads designed to cushion them when they snap on, and the glue holding these pads in place can migrate to the surface. This delays the release of the solenoid, which causes the paper to start feeding slightly late. The error accumulates with each page printed, and eventually the paper is entering the mechanism so late that the printer believes that a jam has occurred. The tell- tale symptom is a print job with a top margin that shrinks from page to page. This problem is fixed by removing the felt pads, cleaning off the adhesive (isopropyl alcohol works well), and placing some electrical tape or other material to provide a cushion for the solenoid. Unfortunately, accessing the solenoids requires disassembling most of the input mechanism. 4L and 4P HP LaserJet 4P The LaserJet 4 series had small printers in the range: the personal-use 4L and the small-business use 4P (and the Macintosh-compatible 4ML and 4MP). These printers both used the Canon PX engine,Printer Works - PX Engine (Accessed June 14, 2006) which like the EX was new at the time of release. The 4L used the 300 DPIPrinter Works - 4L (Accessed June 14, 2006) PX engine, with the 4P using the upgraded 600 DPIPrinter Works - 4P (Accessed June 14, 2006) PX-II engine. The 4L was the first LaserJet with power-saving technology that turned off the printer when not in use. The 4L is also notable in that it was the first LaserJet printer manufactured via \\"Mass Customization & Bulk Shipping\\", where the printer's circuit board, power cord and other final assembly items were assembled regionally, closer to the end-user. This saved the company millions in tariff and shipping costs as well as weeks in time-to-market. This process was used for low-end printers (4L, 4P, etc.), and initially in three regions: North America, Europe and Asia.Edward Feitzinger and Hau L. Lee, Harvard Business Review, \\"Mass Customization at Hewlett- Packard: The Power of Postponement (Accessed June 12, 2010)\\" 4V The 4V and 4MV were B-size printers for graphic artistsPrinter Works - 4V (Accessed June 14, 2006) using the Canon BX-II engine. Hewlett Packard did not consider the original BX engine as \\"good enough\\" for their LaserJet series. The 4V/4MV were released in 1994 and dominated the market due to their competitive price. The 4V series was the first HP printer to offer an internal hard disk option. Common Fixes of the LaserJet 4V and 4MV model can have accordion jam as well, caused either by a worn roller or broken tooth on the gear at the fuser door. This can be repaired by replacement of the front fuser door. The engine over all is reliable. Problems such as paper jams can be fixed by replacement of pickup rollers located under the toner cartridge, replacement of the fuser door, checking if the paper separation paws are not bent, and replacement of the delivery rollers. 4LC and 4LJ Pro The 4LC and 4LJ Pro were printers based on the 4L platform modified for the Chinese and Japanese markets respectively. The 4LC was the \\"first printer designed exclusively for the Chinese market\\", and was released by HP in April 1995. This was followed by the Japanese 4LJ Pro in May 1995. Both of these printers used a 2 byte PCL that had been recently developed for Asian fonts, and came with memory upgrades and Chinese/Japanese fonts. Both printers worked at 600 DPI, with 2MB RAM. Macintosh variants In all the models of the four series an 'M' designation identifies a version designed to work well with the Apple Macintosh, with additional accessories for network connectivity (JetDirect (Ethernet)/LocalTalk), PostScript Level 2 support and more memory, built-in as standard.HP LaserJet 4M Plus details (Accessed June 14, 2006) Comparison {  style=\\"width:90%;margin:auto;text-align:center;\\" + Comparison table of HP LaserJet 4 models - !Model !Introduction !Canon print engine !Print resolution (DPI)Resolution is given in dots per inch (DPI) !Print speed (PPM)Print speed is given in pages per minute (PPM) !Standard memory (RAM in MB) !Maximum memory (RAM in MB) - 4 (4M) October 1992 EX 600 8 2 (6)HP Support - LaserJet 4 model comparison (Accessed June 30, 2006) 34 (26) - 4Si (4Si MX) April 1993 NX 600 17 2 34 - 4L (4ML) May 1993 PX 300 4 1 (2)HP LaserJet 4L, 5L, 6L Printers - Comparison (Accessed March 5, 2009) 2 (2) - 4P (4MP) October 1993 PX-II 600 4 2 (6) 26 (22) - 4+ (4M+) May 1994 EX+ 600 12 2 (6) 66 (50) - 4V (4MV) September 1994 BX-II 600 16 4(12) 68(52) - 4LC/4LJ Pro April/May 1995 ? 600 ? 2 ? } ==See also== *HP LaserJet 5 *PC Load Letter ==ReferencesExternal links== *Compute!

It is located along Adderley and Strand Streets in the city's central business district. ==Lines== Metrorail lines Cape Town station is the hub of the Metrorail Western Cape commuter rail network, which is operated by the Metrorail division of the Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa (PRASA). The network consists of four lines, all of which originate from Cape Town: the Southern Line via the Southern Suburbs to Simon's Town; the Cape Flats Line via Athlone to Retreat; the Central Line via Langa to Mitchell's Plain, Khayelitsha and Bellville; and the Northern Line via Bellville to Paarl, Stellenbosch and Somerset West. Shosholoza Meyl Shosholoza Meyl, the inter-city rail division of PRASA, operates several long- distance passenger rail services from Cape Town: a daily service to and from Johannesburg via Kimberley; a weekly service to and from Durban via Kimberley, Bloemfontein and Pietermaritzburg; and a weekly service to and from East London. These trains terminate at Cape Town station, as well as making a brief stop at Bellville. Shosholoza Meyl also operates a semi-luxury Premier Classe service from Cape Town: weekly trains to and from Johannesburg via Kimberley.https://www.premierclasse.co.za/routes.html Other Cape Town Railway Station is also used by the luxury tourist-oriented Blue Train and the private train holiday company Rovos Rail. ==ServicesHistory and aterations== The first structure Cape Town's first railway station, circa 1870 The first railway station in Cape Town was a rudimentary wooden structure built in 1861, and was located near the current Golden Acre shopping centre. Cape Town's railways were in their infancy and the early station was small and simple.Kleingeld, Christo (2003). A South African Railway History. Accessed 14 December 2009. The Victorian building Cape Town's second station, circa 1900 In 1875 Cape Prime Minister John Molteno began construction of a massive stone complex to serve as the central station to the rapidly-expanding railway network being built. The site chosen was near the bottom of Adderley Street (where its successor still stands). It was large enough to contain the increasing number of train platforms and the headquarters of the recently formed Cape Government Railways, but additional enlargements were nonetheless added over the coming years.Burman, Jose (1984), Early Railways at the Cape, Cape Town: Human & Rousseau, The current station Nearly a hundred years later in the 1960s, the historic stone Victorian building was demolished by the Apartheid government to make way for a modern building that would allow for the racial segregation of all commuters.http://www.xchange.org.za/index.php?option=com_content&task;=view&id;=13&Itemid;=33 The current station complex is the result of alterations due to the preparations for the 2010 Soccer World Cup. Like its predecessor it covers between 25 and 35 city blocks. The renovations are a joint initiative between PRASA-Metrorail and Intersite, the property management company.. The immediate emphasis was on improving the look and feel as well as commuter comfort, with better access, information, safety and security ahead of the 2010 soccer World Cup. ==Notable places nearby== Cape Town railway station is the only one in the City Bowl, so it is the nearest station to all the places of interest in central Cape Town.

(1962). Studies in Shinto and Shrines, p.454. Per the Jinja Honchō, there are approximately 1300 Asama shrines in the country, centered primarily in Shizuoka Prefecture and Yamanashi Prefecture, and to a lesser extent in the prefectures of the Kantō region and Aichi. Almost all Asama Shrines are within sight of Mount Fuji. Where this is not possible because of distance or obstructions, a miniature replica of Mount Fuji known as a made from rocks from the mountain was often erected within the shrine grounds. The head of all Asama shrines is the Fujisan Hongū Sengen Taisha, located in Fujinomiya, Shizuoka. Fujisan Hongū Sengentaisha (official website) In 2013 the Fujisan Hongū Sengen Taisha, Yamamiya Sengen Shrine, Murayama Sengen Shrine, Suyama Sengen Shrine, Fuji Sengen Shrine, Kawaguchi Asama Shrine, and Fuji Omuro Sengen Shrine were added to the World Heritage List as part of the Fujisan Cultural Site. ==Shinto belief== The primary kami at Asama shrines is Konohanasakuya-hime, sometimes in combination with her father, Ōyamatsumi-no-Mikoto and/or sister Iwanaga- hime. Konohanasakuya-hime appears in both the Kojiki and Nihonshoki and appears to have originally associated with protection against fire, per the stories which appear in both chronicles. However, there is no specific reference which explains how she came to be associated with Mount Fuji at some point in the Muromachi or Edo period.Ponsonby-Fane, p. 457. ==History== The derivation of the word “Asama” is subject to considerable uncertainty and debate, but the original meaning of the word appears to be connected with volcanoes or volcanic eruptions, and the presence of water springs in the foothills of such mountains. Mountain-worship based cults centered on in Niigata and in Mie appear contemporary with the mountain-cult centered on Mount Fuji, via references in the Man'yōshū. However, worship of Mount Fuji, as the tallest and most famous volcano in Japan came to dominate. Mount Fuji has erupted eighteen times in recorded history. In order to pacify it, the Imperial Court awarded it court rank and venerated it as Sengen Ōkami in the early Heian period According to shrine tradition from the Fujisan Hongū Sengen Taisha, Sakanoue no Tamuramaro moved an existing shrine from the slopes of Mount Fuji to the lowlands during the reign of Emperor Suinin.Ponsonby-Fane, p. 458. Traditions also exist associating Mount Fuji with immortality-seeking wizards, and attribute the legendary mystical powers of En no Gyōja to his training on the mountain. From the Heian period, the worship of the volcano kami as providers of water combined with Shingon esoteric Buddhism and with Shugendō practices. Yamabushi Matsudai Shōnin is said to have climbed Mount Fuji several hundred times and built a temple, with the retired Emperor Toba as his patron. Encyclopedia of Shinto By the Muromachi period, pilgrimages to climb Mount Fuji increased in popularity, and mandala were produced both as souvenirs, and to spread the cult. Such mandala typically depicted pilgrims landing at Miho no Matsubara, and the various stages of the ascent of Mount Fuji. The top of the mountain is depicted as having three peaks, about which float various Buddhas and Bosatsu. Japanese architecture and art In the Edo period, the Fuji-kō, a religious confraternity system became extremely popular in the Kantō region, using magico-religious practices with talismans to protect followers from illness and catastrophe, despite efforts by the authorities to discourage it. After the Meiji Restoration, the cult of Mount Fuji declined precipitously, and the Fuji-ko groups are now subsumed into various of the sect Shintō organizations. ==Related shrines== *Ichinomiya Asama Shrine (一宮浅間神社) in Fuefuki, Yamanashi Prefecture *Omuro Sengen Shrine (小室浅間神社) in Fujiyoshida, Yamanashi Prefecture *Kitaguchi Hongū Fuji Sengen Shrine (北口本宮冨士浅間神社) in Fujiyoshida, Yamanashi Prefecture *Fujiomuro Sengen Shrine (冨士御室浅間神社) in Fujikawaguchiko, Yamanashi Prefecture *Shizuoka Sengen Shrine (静岡淺間神社) in Aoi-ku, Shizuoka, Shizuoka Prefecture *Fujirokusho Sengen Shrine (富知六所淺間神社) in Fuji, Shizuoka Prefecture *Asamasha (浅間社) in Nara, a Side Shrine of Naramichi Ten Jinja (奈良町天神社), Nara Prefecture *Geino Asama Shrine (芸能浅間神社) in Shinjuku, Tokyo *Naruko Fuji Asama Shrine (成子富士浅間神社) in Shinjuku, Tokyo *Fuji Asama Ookami (富士浅間大神) in Bunkyō, Tokyo *Asama Jinja (浅間神社) in Susono, Shizuoka Prefecture () *Sengen Jinja (浅間神社) in Numazu, Shizuoka Prefecture () ==See also== * List of Shinto shrines * List of Jingū * Asama Maru ==NotesReferences== * Ponsonby-Fane, Richard Arthur Brabazon.

Blake Edwards developed the program as a retooling of his Willie Dante character from Four Star Playhouse, in which the role was played by studio boss Dick Powell. In the 1960–1961 television season, Howard Duff assumed the role of Willie Dante in the NBC adventure/drama series Dante. John Vivyan played the title character Mr. Lucky. Mr. Edwards directed and co-wrote the first episode of Mr. Lucky, and the credits of the first eighteen episodes included the text, \\"Entire production supervised by Blake Edwards.\\" Jack Arnold (director of Creature from the Black Lagoon, The Incredible Shrinking Man, and It Came from Outer Space) produced the show and directed fifteen of the thirty-four episodes. Henry Mancini's smooth theme music for the show reached Number 21 in the US singles charts. He released two successful LP's based on the show, Mr. Lucky and Mr. Lucky Goes Latin. ==Cast and format== Along with John Vivyan cast in the title roll, Ross Martin portrayed Andamo. Pippa Scott had a recurring role as Maggie Shank-Rutherford, Lucky's girlfriend. Tom Brown also had a recurring role, as Lieutenant Rovacs of the city police. Mr. Lucky is an honest professional gambler with extraordinary luck. He carries a pocket watch whose chimes play the first five notes of the Mr. Lucky theme music. He and Andamo operate a floating casino aboard a luxury yacht anchored outside an American port city. (The yacht in reality was the Alamo, a 148-foot yacht owned by former Compton, California mayor Col. C.S. Smith, publisher of the now-defunct Herald American Newspaper chain.) Their business brings them into contact with numerous criminals and people hiding from criminals. This continues even after Lucky changes their business to a floating restaurant (see \\"Format change\\" below). The website \\"TV Obscurities\\" indicates that Mr. Lucky's actual name was never identified in the series. The episode \\"Aces Back to Back\\" reveals that Lucky is a veteran of the United States Navy, and in the episode \\"Odyssey of Hate\\", he demonstrates that he still knows how to manipulate an M-1 rifle. The end credits state that Mr. Lucky was \\"Based on an Original Story: 'Bundles for Freedom' by Milton Holmes.\\" This story was also the basis of the 1943 motion picture Mr. Lucky, starring Cary Grant whose name in the film was Joe Adams. The film and the television series had little in common beside the title and the suave nature of the lead characters. The first episode of the series, \\"The Magnificent Bribe\\", begins with Lucky and Andamo running a successful casino in Andamo's homeland, the island nation of Chobolobo (the name is not mentioned until the second episode). To stay in business, they must pay a weekly bribe of $1000 to the country's corrupt president (Nehemiah Persoff). They lose everything because of Andamo's revolutionary activities: he uses Lucky's yacht, the Fortuna, to smuggle guns to the revolutionaries, and he helps a beautiful female assassin (Ziva Rodann) get into position to kill the president. The episode ends with Lucky and Andamo escaping in a small boat with nothing but the clothes on their backs. In the second episode, \\"They Shall Not Pass\\", Lucky and Andamo arrive by freighter in an unnamed American port city. Lucky wins enough money in a crap game to buy another yacht and a truck full of gambling equipment. He renames the yacht Fortuna II (pronounced \\"Fortuna the Second\\"), and anchors her outside the three-mile limit to operate as a floating casino. The city where Lucky and Andamo operate is never mentioned by name, and various episodes give conflicting clues as to its identity. The city's marked police cars (black and white 1959 Plymouth four-door sedans) are marked simply \\"POLICE\\", not with the city's name or seal. Mr. Lucky drives a 1960 Chrysler New Yorker Chrysler Imperial convertible. ==Format change== Beginning with the February 6, 1960, episode (\\"The Brain Picker\\"), Lucky changed his business from a floating casino to a floating restaurant. This was done by order of the show's sponsor, Lever Brothers, due mainly to the 1950s quiz show scandals. Dwight Whitney wrote about the format change in the following week's issue of TV Guide: \\"The Fumigated Air: Lever Bros. came up with a puzzling decision last week. It decided that soap and gambling don't mix. As the sponsor of one of the year's two big hits, Mr. Lucky (the other being Dennis the Menace), the powers-that-be sent down orders that the celebrated television character played by John Vivyan would henceforth have to be made respectabilized. Almost immediately Lucky turned up running a restaurant instead of gambling aboard his ship. By so ordering it seemed that the soap company was taking a big gamble itself. By taking the bite out of the character, it was running a very real risk of transforming one of the season's big hits into a big flop, to say nothing of fumigating the air so thoroughly that even soap suds might seem astringent after that.\\"Whitney, Dwight. \\"Television Diary\\", TV Guide Vol. 8, No. 7; February 13, 1960; Issue #359, page A-3 ==Cancellation== Despite the fact that the show was one of the highest-rated new series of the 1959–1960 season, being ranked 21st among programs with a 24.4 average household share, Lever Brothers (and alternate sponsor Brown & Williamson) cancelled their sponsorship at the end of the season. CBS could not find other sponsors to replace them, and finally cancelled the series. John Vivyan believed the program was pulled in order to give up its Saturday time slot, as a favor to Jack Benny, to a new drama in the fall of 1960, Checkmate, which was produced by Benny's company, JaMco Productions. ==Attempted revivals== Blake Edwards developed a Mr. Lucky movie for Paramount Pictures in the mid-1960s to follow his big screen adaptation of Peter Gunn for the studio. The disappointing performance of the film Gunn saw the project's abandonment. Aaron Spelling and Blake Edwards later teamed to develop a movie of the week in 1980, Casino, starring Mike Connors as a similar gambler character. Edwards developed another Mr. Lucky revival for New World Television in the late 1980s to follow his Peter Gunn revival for the studio. When the latter project failed to be picked up as a weekly series, New World pulled the plug on Mr. Lucky. ==Episode list== { class= FFFFFF\\" ! CDAD00; width:20px\\" Nº ! CDAD00\\" Title !

The family settled in Jerusalem. Brand began his studies as a child prodigy at the age of seven, with Haim Alexander at the Rubin Academy, where he later received an Artist's and Teacher's diploma. He made his orchestral debut at the age of 11, playing with the Israel Broadcasting Authority Symphony Orchestra.Natan Brand, Stagebill, vol. IX, no. 2, October 1981, Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts, New York Brand married Lori Hillman, with whom he had two sons, Jesse and Ari. He died in 1990 at the age of 46.Natan Brand, 46, An Israeli Pianist - New York Times ==Musical career== The pianist Nadia Reisenberg, pupil of Josef Hofmann, heard Brand play and arranged for him to study at the Mannes College of Music in New York. Later, Brand studied with Reisenberg at the Juilliard School. After attending Juilliard, Brand continued his studies with Dorothy Taubman, to whom he remained close until his death. In 1969, Brand won the American Guild of Musical Artists Award, as well as first prize at the Société Musicale Ville- Marie competition. He also received the prestigious Josephine Fry award. Natan Brand played in all the major halls of New York, where he made his home, and performed throughout the United States, Canada, and Israel. On international tours, he appeared in London, Paris, and Brussels. Brand tended to program his concerts around central themes. In 1983, he played a series of three concerts at Alice Tully Hall, devoting them separately to sonatas, fantasies and etudes. In 1984 he made his Carnegie Hall debut playing concertos by Schumann and Chopin.Natan Brand, 46, An Israeli Pianist - New York Times In addition to his work as a performing artist, Brand also served on the faculty of the Hebrew Arts School in Manhattan, and taught at the University of Tulsa and at the Taubman Institute at Amherst College. ==Critical acclaim== Geoffrey Dorfman: \\"... Brand ... was one of the few keyboard artists—perhaps the last—in the true tradition of Anton Rubinstein: a pianist who played in the Grand Style, fully free to interpret the masterworks as the spirit moved him, with a magnificent technique at his command. His premature death at the age of 46 robbed the music world of a man who was considered by many connoisseurs to be potentially one of the world’s greatest pianists. That he was not so recognized was due to his mercurial temperament (which did him little good in the world of concerts and bookings) and his early death.\\"ALLEGRO MUSIC - Order Page Patsy Morita, Allmusic: \\"Brand was a pianist who took an individual route to interpretation. Regardless of the music - whether it is the innocent Kinderszenen or the passionate Kreisleriana -- there is concentration and conviction in his playing that compels attention. It is not that he was aggressive, but that he was willing to try new things and did so with resolute confidence.\\"Barnes & Noble.com - Music: Natan Brand in Concert, 1982-1990: The Legacy, Vol. 1, CD Bernard Holland, New York Times: \\"Brand has a strong musical personality, and he negotiated the familiar twists of and turns of Carnaval in ways that were original without being wilful. In other words, his use of pauses and his stretching of tempos often took unusual forms, but all seemed to have a sense of careful thought behind them. Mr. Brand's ear favored clear textures and high levels of energy. Despite the scattered missed notes, he seemed very much in control of himself and his instrument.

With Australia holding a 1–0 lead at half-time and scoring a second goal just after the break, it looked likely that they would progress to the World Cup. Immediately following Australia's second goal, spectator Peter Hore, known for disrupting major events, ran onto the field and cut up Iran's goal net, causing a halt in play. However, Australia's dominance continued until a controversial booking of Harry Kewell following a collision with Iranian goalkeeper Ahmad Reza Abedzadeh in the 72nd minute. This seemed to quell the Australians' momentum, as an Iranian revival, led by Khodadad Azizi, saw Iran score two quick goals to make the score 3–3 on aggregate, with Iran progressing on away goals. Despite being undefeated throughout their entire qualifying campaign, Australia had again failed to qualify for the World Cup finals. Along with host nation and eventual winner France (who as host nation did not need to qualify), and Saint Kitts and Nevis, Australia were one of three teams to not lose a game in the entire campaign. The broadcast of the game on SBS featured closing comments from a clearly distraught Les Murray and Johnny Warren, with Warren openly weeping on air. { width=\\"100%\\" valign=\\"top\\" width=\\"50%\\" { style=\\"font-size: 90%\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"0\\" colspan=\\"4\\" AUSTRALIA: - !width=\\"25\\" !!width=\\"25\\" - GK1Mark Bosnich -  2Craig Moore  -  3Stan Lazaridis -  4Steve Horvat -  5Alex Tobin (c) -  6Ned Zelić -  7Robbie Slater  -  8Craig Foster -  9Mark Viduka -  10Aurelio Vidmar  -  11Harry Kewell  - colspan=3Substitutions: - GK22Zeljko Kalac -  12Milan Ivanović -  19Tony Vidmar  -  14Ernie Tapai  -  15Josip Skoko -  16Graham Arnold  -  17John Aloisi - colspan=3Manager: - colspan=\\"4\\" Terry Venables } valign=\\"top\\" width=\\"50%\\" { style=\\"font-size: 90%\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"0\\" align=center colspan=\\"4\\" IRAN: - !width=\\"25\\" !!width=\\"25\\" - GK1Ahmadreza Abedzadeh (c) -  4Mohammad Khakpour  -  16Reza Shahroudi  -  5Afshin Peyrovani -  11Khodadad Azizi -  6Karim Bagheri  -  10Ali Daei -  2Mehdi Mahdavikia  -  9Hamid Reza Estili -  20Mehdi Pashazadeh -  23Naeem Saadavi  - colspan=3Substitutions: - GK22Nima Nakisa -  15Ali Akbar Ostad- Asadi  -  8Majid Namjoo-Motlagh -  25Mehrdad Minavand -  24Javad Zarincheh -  7Ali Reza Mansourian  -  18Ebrahim Tahami  - colspan=3Manager: - colspan=\\"4\\" Valdeir Vieira } } { width=100% style=\\"font-size: 90%\\"  width=50% valign=top OFFICIALS *Assistant referees: **Imre Bozoky (Hungary) **Belo Mezo (Hungary) *Fourth official: Attila Hanacsek (Hungary)  width=50% valign=top MATCH RULES *90 minutes *30 minutes of extra-time if necessary *Penalty shoot-out if scores still level: *3 (of 7) substitutions permitted } == References External links== *10th Anniversary of Melbourne Showdown, IranSportsPress.com *First leg *Second leg Play 4 1997 1997 1998 Play Category:1997 in Australian soccer Category:20th century in Tehran Category:1990s in Melbourne Category:November 1997 sports events in Oceania Category:November 1997 sports events in Asia Category:International association football competitions hosted by Australia Category:International association football competitions hosted by Iran ","title":"1998 FIFA World Cup qualification (AFC–OFC play-off)"},{"id":"5556529","text":"The Way To A Girl's Heart Is Through Her Boyfriend's Stomach, released in 1999 through Tank Records, is the debut full-length release from the Massachusetts based melodic hardcore band now known as A Wilhelm Scream. ==Information== Originally recorded and released through Tank Records in 1999 under their at the time current name, Smackin' Isaiah. It was reissued in 2003 by All About Records due to the rarity of the original release, as it had only been produced in a small number. In spite of the band having changed their name at this time, it was still reissued under Smackin' Isaiah. Today, both copies are almost impossible to find and have become collectables, alongside other Smackin' Isaiah material, for hardcore A Wilhelm Scream fans. A Wilhelm Scream considers this album as their first real release, as all the songs had been written after they had a complete and steady line-up. They have also stated that this, in retrospect, is their most cheerful record. Despite the original and reissue having identical covers, the colour of the CDs are different; the original being blue, whilst the reissue is red. The disc-tray insert includes a copy of an autographed poster addressed to the band from legendary porn star Ron Jeremy. It is displayed in color on the original, but is black-and-white on the re-issue. As this album uses copyrighted sound clips from major Hollywood films and has two hidden tracks, the following statement is written on the inside left fold of the tray card: \\"Big entertainment conglomorates, please don't sue the fuck out of us for using your movies for our stupid, played-out punk rock album sound bytes.

It captures the daily life of people and the landscape of the capital, Bianjing (present-day Kaifeng) during the Northern Song. The theme is often said to celebrate the festive spirit and worldly commotion at the Qingming Festival, rather than the holiday's ceremonial aspects, such as tomb sweeping and prayers. Successive scenes reveal the lifestyle of all levels of the society from rich to poor as well as different economic activities in rural areas and the city, and offer glimpses of period clothing and architecture. The painting is considered to be the most renowned work among all Chinese paintings, and it has been called \\"China's Mona Lisa.\\" As an artistic creation, the piece has been revered and artists of subsequent dynasties made re-interpretive versions, each following the overall composition and the theme of the original but differing in details and technique.Bruce Doar, \\"International Conference on Qingming Shanghe Tu and Song Dynasty Genre Paintings, Beijing, 10–12 October 2005.,\\" China Heritage Newsletter, China Heritage Project 4 (December 2005) Over the centuries, the Qingming scroll was collected and kept among numerous private owners, before it eventually returned to public ownership. The painting was a particular favorite of Puyi, the Last Emperor, who took the Song dynasty original with him when he left Beijing. It was re-purchased in 1945 and kept at the Palace Museum in the Forbidden City. The Song dynasty original and the Qing versions, in the Beijing and Taipei Palace Museums respectively, are regarded as national treasures and are exhibited only for brief periods every few years. ==The Song original == The scroll is in height and long. In its length there are 814 humans, 28 boats, 60 animals, 30 buildings, 20 vehicles, 8 sedan chairs, and 170 trees. Only about twenty women appear in the Song dynasty original, and only women of low social rank are visible out of doors unless accompanied by men. The countryside and the densely populated city are the two main sections in the picture, with the river meandering through the entire length. The right section is the rural area of the city. There are crop fields and unhurried rural folk—predominately farmers, goatherds, and pig herders—in bucolic scenery. A country path broadens into a road and joins with the city road. The left half is the urban area, which eventually leads into the city proper with the gates. Many economic activities, such as people loading cargoes onto the boat, shops, and even a tax office, can be seen in this area. People from all walks of life are depicted: peddlers, jugglers, actors, paupers begging, monks asking for alms, fortune tellers and seers, doctors, innkeepers, teachers, millers, metalworkers, carpenters, masons, and official scholars from all ranks. The bridge scene where the crew of an oncoming boat have not yet fully lowered their sails and are in danger of crashing into the bridge Outside the city proper (separated by the gate to the left), there are businesses of all kinds, selling wine, grain, secondhand goods, cookware, bows and arrows, lanterns, musical instruments, gold and silver, ornaments, dyed fabrics, paintings, medicine, needles, and artifacts, as well as many restaurants. The vendors (and in the Qing revision, the shops themselves) extend all along the great bridge, called the Rainbow Bridge (虹橋 Hong Qiao) or, more rarely, the Shangdu Bridge (上土橋). Where the great bridge crosses the river is the center and main focus of the scroll. A great commotion animates the people on the bridge. A boat approaches at an awkward angle with its mast not completely lowered, threatening to crash into the bridge. The crowds on the bridge and along the riverside are shouting and gesturing toward the boat. Someone near the apex of the bridge lowers a rope to the outstretched arms of the crew below. In addition to the shops and diners, there are inns, temples, private residences, and official buildings varying in grandeur and style, from huts to mansions with grand front- and backyards. People and commodities are transported by various modes: wheeled wagons, beasts of labor (in particular, a large number of donkeys and mules), sedan chairs, and chariots. The river is packed with fishing boats and passenger-carrying ferries, with men at the river bank, pulling the larger ships. Many of these details are roughly corroborated by Song dynasty writings, principally the Dongjing Meng Hua Lu, which describes many of the same features of life in the capital. == Exhibition == In a rare move, the Song original was exhibited in Hong Kong from June 29 to mid-August 2007 to commemorate the 10th anniversary of Hong Kong's transfer to the People's Republic of China. It is estimated that the costs of shipping the painting ran into tens of millions of dollars in addition to an undisclosed cost of insuring this piece of priceless art. From January 2–24, 2012, the painting was exhibited in the Tokyo National Museum as the centerpiece of a special exhibition to mark the 40th anniversary of normalized diplomatic relations between China and Japan, with the Japanese museum officials providing the \\"highest security standards\\" for the work. == Copies == The original painting is celebrated as the most famed work of art from the Song dynasty. It was a pride of the personal imperial collections of emperors for centuries. These emperors commissioned copies, or reproductions, reinterpretations and elaborations, over forty of which are in museums in China, Japan, Korea, Taiwan, the United Kingdom, North America, and France. A large modern reproduction is displayed in the entrance of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Beijing. An early copy, generally considered to be very faithful to the original, was made by Zhao Mengfu during the Yuan dynasty. A notable remake was painted during the Ming dynasty (14th to 17th centuries) by Qiu Ying. This version has a length of 6.7 meters, longer than the original. It also replaced the scenery from the Song dynasty to that of the Ming dynasty based on contemporary fashions and customs, updating the costumes worn by the characters and the styles of vehicles (boats and carts). The Song wooden bridge is replaced with a stone bridge in the Ming remake. The arc of the stone bridge is much taller than that of the wooden original, and where the original had a boat about to crash into the bridge, the reinterpretation has a boat being methodically guided under the bridge by ropes, pulled by men ashore, several other large boats dutifully waiting their turn, undisturbed.Sing Tao Daily Hong Kong Island edition. Issue 72, p.2 A 12 meter long copy from the late Ming period is kept in the collection of the Museum of Applied Arts, Vienna in Austria. Another version by five Qing dynasty court painters (Chen Mu, Sun Hu, Jin Kun, Dai Hong and Cheng Zhidao) was presented to the Qianlong Emperor on January 15, 1737. This version, shown below, was later moved, along with many other artifacts, to the National Palace Museum in Taipei in 1949. This remake is generally considered to be one the most distinguished of all later remakes due to its relatively modern style, high degree of detail, and high level of preservation. There are many more people, over 4,000, in this Qing remake, which also is much larger (at 11 metres by 35 cm, or 37 ft by 1 ft). The leftmost third of this version is within the palace, with buildings and people appearing refined and elegant. Most people within the castle are women, with some well-dressed officials. On the contrary, in the original Song version, the leftmost side is still the busy city.  Associated poem  In April 1742, a poem was added to the right- most end of the Qing remake. The poem apparently was composed by the Qianlong Emperor; the calligraphy is in the running script style, and is in the hand of Liang Shizheng (梁詩正), a prominent court official and frequent companion of the Qianlong Emperor. The poem reads as follows: { - ! Original ! Pinyin ! Literal translation -    -  Wú gōng jù suìjīn Craftsmen from Wu collect spare change -  ōugē wànjǐng fù  -  chéngquè jiǔchóng shēn The watchtowers of the city rise to great heights. -   The bustling scene is truly impressive. -  yízōng jiè tànxún It is a chance to explore vestiges of bygone days. -  dāngshí kuā Yù dà At that time, people marveled at the size of Yu, -  cǐrì tàn Huī Qīn. And now, we lament the fates of Hui and Qin. - } The digital River of Wisdom, on display at the World Expo 2010.  Digital version  For a three-month period in the World Expo 2010 presented at the China Pavilion, the original painting was remade into a 3D animated, viewer-interactive digital version, titled River of Wisdom; at 128 × 6.5 m, it is roughly 30 times the size of the original scroll. The computer-animated mural, with moving characters and objects and portraying the scene in 4-minute day and night cycles, was one of the primary exhibitions in the Chinese Pavilion, drawing queues up to two hours with a reservation. Elaborate computer animation gives life to the painting. After the Expo, the digital version was on display at the AsiaWorld–Expo in Hong Kong from November 9 to 29, 2010, where it was a major commercial success. It was then exhibited at the Macau Dome in Macau from March 25 to April 14, 2011. The digital painting also traveled to Taiwan and displayed at the Expo Dome in Taipei from July 1 to September 4, 2011. From December 7, 2011 to February 6, 2012, in an exhibition titled A Moving Masterpiece: The Song Dynasty As Living Art, the digital reproduction was exhibited at the Singapore Expo. The digital version was also put on display at the River City Shopping Complex, Bangkok in January 2019. Today, it is on permanent exhibition at the China Art Museum, Shanghai. == Gallery Analysis and questions== Scholars have studied the painting carefully in the second half of the twentieth and beginning of the twenty- first century but do not agree on many basic points.  Translations of the title  Scholars have disputed the accuracy of the translation of the painting's name; the word Qingming may refer to either the Qingming Festival or to \\"peace and order\\". Several translations have been suggested, such as: * Going Upriver on the Qingming Festival * Life along the Bian River at the Qingming Festival * Life Along the Bian River at the Pure Brightness Festival * Riverside Scene at Qingming Festival * Upper River during Qing Ming Festival * Spring Festival on the River * Spring Festival Along the River, or alternatively, * Peace Reigns Over the River During the late 1960s, the Taipei Palace Museum released a series of books (later digitized as CD-ROM), videos, and stamps about the scroll that translated it loosely as A City of Cathay. Meaning and content Three things have been accepted about the original painting: * The city depicted is Kaifeng * It was painted before the fall of the Northern Song dynasty in 1127 * It depicts the Qingming Festival Some recent scholarship challenges each of those assertions: * The city depicted is an idealized non-existent city * It was painted after the fall of the Northern Song dynasty in 1127 * It depicts a scene in early autumn In 2003 a further interpretation was presented:Tsao Hsingyuan, \\"Unraveling the Mystery of the Handscroll 'Qingming Shanghe Tu'\\", in Journal of Song-Yuan Studies 33 (2003): 155–179. * The city depicted is indeed Kaifeng * It depicts a day in the Qingming solar term of the Chinese calendar, but not the Qingming Festival itself An interpretation published in 2013 proposed that the painting was the artist's subtle entreaty to the emperor to discern dangerous trends beneath the surface of prosperity, and some of the suggested hints were: * Receiving grain shipment at the docks was crucial to Kaifeng which depended on transporting the food from the far south, yet only a lowly official was on duty * The few guards stationed at the city gate and the docks appeared not to be alert and even lax in their appearances * The term \\"Qingming\\" did not refer to the solar term but was taken from the phrase 清明之世 (\\"A bright and enlightened era\\") from the Book of the Later Han, and the name of the painting was meant to be ironic The wooden bridge depicted in the original version was reconstructed by a team of engineers and documented by the PBS television show NOVA during their Secrets of Lost Empires series. == See also == * Chinese painting * Culture of the Song dynasty == References  External links == * The Palace Museum, Beijing * The National Palace Museum, Taiwan * The Place of \\"Qingming Shanghe Tu\\" in the Historical Geography of Song Dynasty Dongjing * Interactive paintings from the Harvard University one and two * Along the River During the Qingming Festival at the Columbia University * Full interactive painting of the Qing remake on the National Palace Museum website * Along the River During the Qingming Festival at China Online Museum Category:Bridges in art Category:Camels in art Category:Culture in Kaifeng Category:Farming in art Category:Maritime paintings Category:Paintings by Zhang Zeduan Category:Paintings in China Category:Religious festivals in China Category:Song dynasty paintings Category:Works about festivals ","title":"Along the River During the Qingming Festival"},{"id":"5556570","text":"Ivan Tucakov (born 1978 in Belgrade) is a world music composer, guitarist, producer and promoter currently living in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. ==Life== Tucakov, of Serbo-Croatian descent, spent the first eight years of his childhood in the plains of central Turkey, then moved to live in Serbia.

Cultura Rasa presents an integrated picture of all animal cultures, built from the bottom-up: starting from the world of atomic matter, over biological systems that they create, which further emerge into neural networks that ultimately build cultural systems. Cultura Rasa presents a dozen original hypotheses within the disciplines of science and philosophy, whilst also proposing a preliminary structure of the tree of culture. Ivan’s intent with this primer is to create accuracy and consistency in concept definition, to offer a deeper understanding and tolerance of varying cultural worldviews. ==ReferencesExternal links== * Tambura Rasa Official web site * Tambura Rasa YouTube page * Vino & Forte Official web site * Vino & Forte YouTube page * Cultura Rasa Official web site Category:People from Belgrade Category:1978 births Category:Living people ","title":"Ivan Tucakov"},{"id":"5556571","text":"Henri Hauser (19 July 1866 – 27 May 1946) was a French historian, geographer, and economist. A pioneer in the study of the economic history of the early modern period, he also wrote on contemporary economic issues and held the first chair in economic history to be established at a French university.Boer, Pim den (2014).

He was born in Oran into a middle-class Jewish family who had moved to French Algeria for health reasons but returned to France when Hauser was four years old. Hauser was educated at the Lycée Condorcet in Paris and then at the École Normale Supérieure where he came first in both the entrance and leaving examinations. He initially taught in provincial lycées before taking his doctorate in 1892 with a thesis on the 16th-century Huguenot leader, François de la Noue.Davis, Natalie Zemon (2006). \\"Henri Hauser: historien, citoyen, pionnier\\", pp. 15–24 in Séverine-Antigone Marin and Georges-Henri Soutou (eds.), Henri Hauser (1866-1946): humaniste, historien, républicain. Presses de l'Université de Paris-Sorbonne. Hauser went on to become a professor of ancient and medieval history at the University of Clermont-Ferrand, modern history and geography at the University of Dijon, and finally a professor of history and economic history at the Sorbonne from 1919 to 1936. His 1905 book L'impérialisme américain predicted the decline of Europe and the dominance of the United States, while his 1915 Méthodes allemandes d'expansion économique analyzed the role played by German industry in the outbreak of World War I. Hauser was awarded the Legion of Honor in 1919 and in 1945 the Académie française awarded him the Prix de l'Académie for his life's work. ==Biography== Early life and education Hauser was born into a Jewish family of republican sympathies. His father Auguste Hauser (1816–1884) had been a Freemason and was a tailor by trade. His mother, Zélia Hauser née Aron (1840–1879), was the daughter of a prosperous merchant and exporter in Besançon. Although both of Hauser's parents were born in Besançon, their families' origins were in Luemschwiller in the Alsace region. Henri and his elder brother Félix-Paul were born in Oran in French Algeria where the family had relocated to improve Zélia's health and where Auguste had a tailor shop. The family returned to France when Henri was four years old, on the eve of the Franco-Prussian War. After a short stay in Marseille, they settled in Seine-Saint-Denis near Paris where Auguste resumed his trade as a tailor. Hauser's mother Zélia died of tuberculosis when he was thirteen. His maternal uncle, Henry Aron, then looked after the education of Henri and Félix-Paul. He enrolled Henri in the Lycée Condorcet to prepare him for eventual study at the École Normale Supérieure. Hauser entered the École Normale Supérieure in August 1885. One of his mentors there was the geographer Paul Vidal de la Blache who would be a lifelong influence on him. Upon his graduation from the École in 1888 when he came first in the Agrégation examinations for history and geography, Hauser received a teaching appointment at the lycée in Bourges. He subsequently taught at the lycées of Pau and Poitiers before receiving his doctorate in 1892 from the Faculté des lettres de Paris (University of France).Gerbod, Paul (2006). \\"Henri Hauser, Enseignant\\", pp. 25–40 in Séverine-Antigone Marin and Georges-Henri Soutou (eds.), Henri Hauser (1866–1946): humaniste, historien, républicain. Presses de l'Université de Paris-Sorbonne. His doctoral dissertation, supervised by Gabriel Monod, was on the 16th-century Huguenot leader, François de la Noue. It was published by Hachette that same year and reviewed by Jean Réville in the Revue de l'histoire des religions. Réville noted the dissertation's erudition and the new light shed on de la Noue's reputation by Hauser's study.Réville, Jean (1892). \\"Chronique\\".

Title page of Hauser's extensively annotated translation of Voyage du Levant which shed new light on the life of Philippe du Fresne-Canaye Academic career Hauser's first university appointment was as a lecturer (chargé de cours) in ancient and medieval history at the University of Clermont-Ferrand in 1893. There he published several studies which continued to shed new light on the religious and economic history of the 16th century, including Voyage du Levant. Hauser had discovered Philippe Canaye's hitherto unpublished account of his 1573 voyage to Constantinople in the Bibliothèque nationale de France. He translated the Italian manuscript and published it in 1897 with extensive notes and a biography of Canaye which corrected many errors in previous accounts of his life.Monod, Gabriel and Lichtenberger, André (1897) \\"France\\". Revue Historique, Vol. 65, No. 2, pp. 337–338. Retrieved via JSTOR 28 January 2016 . Hauser was promoted to Professor of History at Clermont-Ferrand in 1896 and remained at the university until 1899 when the Dreyfus Affair made his position untenable. During that year he established a section of the Ligue des droits de l'homme at Clermont-Ferrand and gave a series of public lectures attacking the conviction of Dreyfus for treason as \\"illegal\\". Hauser wrote, \\"I want a France great and noble, a France faithful to its mission of justice and truth.\\" Antisemitic students at the university and the right-wing press attacked him as a \\"traitor\\" and a \\"Prussian\\". Hauser took a leave of absence from Clermont-Ferrand, moved back to Paris with his wife Thérèse and their young daughter Alice and threw himself into writing teaching manuals for geography and comparative studies on the teaching of geography and economics in the French colonies. One of his more eclectic works from this period was his 1901 L'Or, a book on gold in all its aspects including its extraction, metallurgy, the regions in which it is mined, and its use in both industry and commerce. The following year it was awarded the Prix Montyon. In 1901, Hauser was offered an appointment to the University of Dijon and taught there until 1919 as Professor of Modern History. He also taught commercial and industrial geography at the Conservatoire National des Arts et Métiers from 1915 to 1933, first as a lecturer and then as a professor. In 1919 he received his first appointment to the University of Paris. He began there as a lecturer in modern economic history, was promoted to professor sans chaire in 1921, and in 1927 was given the university's first chair in economic history.Institut de France (2013).

Retrieved 28 January 2016 7th edition of Hauser's influential Méthodes allemandes d'expansion économique, first published in 1915 and later in English as Germany's Commercial Grip on the World According to cultural historian Pim den Boer, Hauser was \\"exceptionally knowledgeable about a wide range of subjects\\" which was reflected in his scholarship. Throughout his career Hauser's approach was a multidisciplinary one and emphasized the roles played by both economics and geography in historical scholarship, views expressed as early as his 1903 L'enseignement des sciences sociales and his influential 1906 essay \\"La Géographie humaine et l'histoire économique\\".Darby, Henry Clifford (2002).

Hauser's Méthodes allemandes d'expansion économique in which he analyzed the role played by German industry in the outbreak of the war had been published in 1915. The book was translated into English by Manfred Emanuel and Hauser and was published in London in 1917 and New York in 1918 as Germany's Commercial Grip on the World. The American edition came out as Germany's defeat seemed imminent and the allied powers were contemplating the terms of an eventual peace treaty. In his preface to that edition James Laurence Laughlin wrote: > I know of no other available authority who has so fully and so intelligently > explained the methods by which Germany has gained her remarkable position in > the markets of the world.

Scribner After World War I ended, Hauser returned to his primary specialty, the history of the early modern period, but continued to publish on many contemporary historical, economic and geographical subjects. According to den Boer, one of Hauser's finest historical works from this period was his 1933 La prépondérance espagnole (1559-1660) which he characterised as \\"rightly considered a masterly and original synthesis.\\" It echoes the view of Augustin Renaudet in a paper read at a meeting of the Société d'Histoire Moderne shortly after Hauser's death. La prépondérance espagnole had multiple editions and was reprinted in 1973 with an introduction and eulogy to Hauser by Pierre Chaunu. In the interwar period Hauser had an increasingly international presence. Between 1918 and 1920, he regularly visited Alfred Zimmern in Oxford University and Zimmern was also frequently in Paris to work on the post-war diplomatic conditions. In 1923, Hauser was invited by Edwin F. Gay to be an exchange professor at Harvard University where he taught an economics course and gave various lectures both at the university and in other American cities. In 1929 he was invited to give conferences and lectures at King's College London and the London School of Economics where he became one of the founder members of the International scientific committee on price history led by William Beveridge.Demade, Julien (2018).

Publications de la Sorbonne Georges Dumas, an old friend from Hauser's student days at the École Normale invited him to Brazil in the 1930s to advise on the training of historians.

Bloomsbury Academic. Hauser was also a pillar of the Alliance Française. He and his brother Félix- Paul had become members in the late 1880s, only a few years after its founding. He was appointed to its administrative council in 1912, contributed numerous articles on French historical figures to its publications, and was elected its vice president in 1933.Chaubet, François (2006). \\"Henri Hauser et l'Alliance française\\", pp. 267–279 in Séverine-Antigone Marin and Georges- Henri Soutou (eds.), Henri Hauser (1866-1946): humaniste, historien, républicain.

Later years Law on the status of Jews annotated by Petain Hauser retired from the University of Paris in 1936 at the age of 70 with Marc Bloch succeeding him in the chair of economic history, but he continued his scholarly work and publication in the ensuing years. Amongst the works he produced after his retirement was La naissance du Protestantisme which won the 1941 Prix Eugène Carrière of the Académie française. The lives of both men were seriously impacted by the outbreak of World War II. Hauser came out of retirement and moved with his family to Rennes in 1939 to cover a teaching post at the university left vacant when its lecturer was drafted. Bloch left his position at the Sorbonne that same year to join the French Army. After France's defeat by the Germans in June 1940, Bloch returned to Paris, but when the Vichy laws on the status of Jews were passed in October of that year, both he and Hauser were declared \\"undesirable professors\\". Bloch joined the French resistance in 1942 and was later imprisoned by the Gestapo and executed. Hauser remained in Rennes, now forced to wear the yellow badge, and unable to teach. While there he learned that his apartment in Paris which contained his library had been completely pillaged as had his country house in Herblay. Nevertheless, he continued to publish articles in journals such as Revue Historique, although his name and those of the other Jewish scholars were replaced with their initials. He also began working on his memoires.Renaudet, Augustin (1946). \\"Henri Hauser (1966–1946)\\". Revue Historique, Vol. 196, No. 4, pp. 498-502.

In 1697, the Russian Cossacks imposed taxes on the Alyutors, who would show armed resistance in the next few years. After the suppression of the 1751 uprising, the number of the Alyutors significantly decreased. Also, they were constantly under attack from the Chukchis, who often confiscated their reindeer herds. In the late 18th century, the Alyutors were an isolated and secluded group of people, which helped them to avoid the smallpox epidemics almost unharmed. Also, such isolation helped them to preserve their traditional way of life. Traditionally the Alyutors were engaged in reindeer breeding, fishing, trapping, and hunting. They positioned their settlements along the rivers on elevated spots with good visibility around them. Octagonal earth houses with vertical walls meant for 3 to 5 families were the only type of housing among the Alyutors up until the 19th century. Beginning in the 1950s and continuing through the 1970s, Alyutor children were sent to boarding schools which increased their loss of the Alyutor language and decreased their training in Alyutor traditions. Many Alyutors became teachers, doctors, geologists, and zoo technicians during the Soviet period. Presently, the Alyutor traditions, culture, and art are endangered because of the decreases in reindeer population and reproduction caused by the worsening ecology of the region. ==NotesSee also== *Alyutor language ==References== Wixman, Ronald (1984) The Peoples of the USSR: An Ethnographic Handbook ==External links== *The Red Book: Description of the Alyutors Category:Ethnic groups in Siberia Category:Indigenous peoples of North Asia Category:Indigenous small-numbered peoples of the North, Siberia and the Far East Category:History of the Kamchatka Peninsula Category:Kamchatka Peninsula Category:Modern nomads Category:Nomadic groups in Eurasia Category:People from Kamchatka Krai ","title":"Alyutors"},{"id":"5556643","text":"Alexander Timothy McKee (born March 14, 1953) is an American former competition swimmer and three-time Olympic silver medalist.

It was built in 1938 by the leading roller coaster designer and builder of that era, Philadelphia Toboggan Coasters. It was Idlewild's first and only roller coaster for decades until the larger Wild Mouse coaster was erected in 1993. The coaster closed in 2016, amidst safety concerns, but was reopened for the 2018 Operation Season. Built over a hillside at Idlewild Park, the Rollo Coaster is an out and back format. It uses skid brakes operated manually with a lever. The train consists of 4 cars that have 2 rows in 1 car and 1 row in the others. Each row has 2 seats. It was popular with coaster enthusiasts due to its lack of restraints except for a grab bar, until 2018. It is located next to the Carousel and Flying Aces. While the Rollo Coaster features only small hills, it uses topography to its advantage. Built over steep terrain, the ride features many tight twists and turns which create a rough ride and a sense of much greater speed. This coaster was the inspiration for Boulder Dash, a similar but much larger coaster at Lake Compounce. The Rollo Coaster was an ACE Coaster Classic. ==Incident== On August 11, 2016, a three-year-old boy was thrown from the Rollo Coaster. The boy sustained injuries and was rushed to a Pittsburgh hospital by helicopter, where he was listed in critical condition with head and chest injuries. The boy was in the hospital for two months before being released. The ride was closed pending an investigation and remained closed for the remainder of the season, and all of the 2017 season. In May 2017, the Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture, Division of Rides and Amusements released its investigative report, detailing how the riders switched seats after ride operators checked them, resulting in the riders not meeting the rider height requirements. In addition, the report noted several instances of excessive wear and movement of the train hitches and tracks, but that it wasn't known whether these factors caused the accident. The report listed several requirements for the ride to be reopened, including the addition of seat belts, a reevaluation of minimum rider height, and a ride evaluation by a Professional Engineer. Based on this report, the state also recommended amusement parks with similar roller coasters voluntarily make take the same actions. Idlewild announced they had procured a new train for the Rollo Coaster, which included seat belts, and that they expected the ride to resume operation for the 2018 season, pending a state inspection. ==ReferencesExternal links== * Idlewild website Category:Roller coasters in Pennsylvania Category:Roller coasters introduced in 1938 Category:1938 establishments in Pennsylvania ","title":"Rollo Coaster"},{"id":"5556657","text":"Simferopol municipality council Simferopol City Municipality (, , ) (officially \\"the territory governed by the Simferopol city council\\") is one of the 25 regions of the Crimean peninsula, currently subject to a territorial dispute between the Russian Federation and Ukraine.

The law was proposed by physicist Georg Ohm in 1843.Ohm, G., Annalen der Physik (1843) 59 513 Hermann von Helmholtz elaborated the law into what is often today known as Ohm's acoustic law, by adding that the quality of a tone depends solely on the number and relative strength of its partial simple tones, and not on their relative phases. Helmholtz championed the law in opposition to contrary evidence expounded by August Seebeck. The law has also been interpreted as \\"a pitch corresponding to a certain frequency can only be heard if the acoustical wave contains power at that frequency.\\" These laws are true to the extent that the ear is sensitive to the frequency and amplitude of the acoustic waves, and further, is able to resolve the differences in their frequency. In modern times, the sensitivity of human hearing to the phase of tone components has been extensively investigated.

The parish is situated just south of Mallow, on the main Mallow-Cork Road and Rail Line. The population of the parish is about 1,000 people. There are two churches and schools in the area, Analeentha and Burnfort. The civil parish consists of 17 townlands. ==History== In medieval times the area was known in Irish as An Mhóin Mhór (the Great Bog). After the abbey was founded it was named Mainistir na Móna Móire (the abbey of the Great Bog). In medieval Latin documents it was usually referred to simply as Mora. It was formerly believed that the Abbey was built c. 1199 by the Knights Templar and later turned over to the Knights Hospitaller of St. John. The exact foundation date is not recorded but the earliest reference to it is 1290, when the 'master of Mora' witnessed a charter concerning Hospitaller properties in Dublin. Sections of the original enclosure walls with two towers still survive. The original enclosure was much larger but has been cut by modern roads and the railway embankment. Most of the original church is standing, and the large square tower at one corner of the enclosure is believed to have been a mill. In 1334 wardship of the ‘mill of Mora’ was granted to Christiana, wife of Henry Say, for a period of ten years. Another ruined building in the field south of the church may have been the monks' hall. The enclosure would have had a substantial gatehouse and a range of domestic and agricultural buildings including a refectory, an infirmary, a guesthouse, a dormitory, stables, brewhouse, forge and so on. The abbey came under the control of the McCarthys around 1500. It was closed down in 1541 after King Henry VIII ordered the dissolution of the monasteriesHistorical plaque at Mourne Abbey and was granted by the crown to the McCarthys This abbey now lies in ruins, as does Barrett's Castle, on the nearby hilltop. The castle was originally built by Cogans, the Anglo-Norman lords who founded the nearby town of Ballynamona and who donated the lands to the Hospitallers to build the abbey. The castle was said to have been destroyed by Cromwell’s forces, around 1651. The parish also played a major role in the Irish War of Independence. A failed ambush of British forces occurred there near the Abbey where eight volunteers lost their lives. Tomás Mac Curtain, former Lord Mayor of Cork who was killed by British forces in 1920, was also from the parish of Mourneabbey. ==Sport== Today the parish has a strong sporting element. Clyda Rovers GAA club is the most successful and longest serving club. A new €1.3 Million sporting & community complex was constructed between the years of 2000 and 2010. Their Senior Ladies Football team succeeded in winning the All-Ireland Senior Final in 2018 after years of trying for many years. They also have previously won the Junior and Intermediate All-Irelands, and became the first team to win all 3 of them. ==Transport== Mourne Abbey railway station was opened on 1 May 1892 and finally closed on 9 September 1963. ==ReferencesFurther reading== * Historical and Topographical Notes, Etc. on Buttevant ..., Volume 1 ==See also== * List of abbeys and priories in Ireland (County Cork) Category:Civil parishes of County Cork ","title":"Mourne Abbey"},{"id":"5556691","text":"Conducător (, \\"Leader\\") was the title used officially by Romanian dictator Ion Antonescu during World War II, also occasionally used in official discourse to refer to Carol II and Nicolae Ceaușescu. ==History== The word is derived from the Romanian verb a conduce, from the Latin ducere (\\"to lead\\"), cognate with such titles as dux, duke, duce and doge. Its meaning also parallels other titles, such as Führer in Nazi Germany,Brady & Kaplan, p.176; Cioroianu, p.416; Jelavich, p.227; Kligman, p.291 Duce in Fascist Italy and caudillo in Francoist Spain. It was first employed as an additional title by King Carol II during the final years of the National Renaissance Front regime,Cioroianu, p.416 and soon after employed by Marshal Ion Antonescu as he assumed dictatorial powers after September 14, 1940.Brady & Kaplan, p.176; Butnaru, p.70; Chehabi & Linz, p.14; Cioroianu, p.416; Kligman, p.291 Nominally, Antonescu was Prime Minister and the role of head of state was filled by King Michael, but all real power rested with Antonescu.Butnaru, p.70; Jelavich, p.227 According to historian Adrian Cioroianu, through the use of the term, Antonescu meant to highlight connections with Germany, and after the fall of the Iron Guard from shared government (the National Legionary State), his own personal regime. The term was occasionally used in official discourse as a reference to Nicolae Ceaușescu, leader of the Socialist Republic of Romania, starting in the period after 1971, at a time when the Romanian Communist Party grew in membership but decreased in importance due to Ceaușescu's increasing personality cult.Berry, p.14; Brady & Kaplan, p.176; Chehabi & Linz, p.14; Cioroianu, p.414, 416, 422-427; Gallagher, p.61; Kligman, p.291 It was used in parallel with the rarer cârmaci (\\"helmsman\\"), in turn borrowed from similar rhetoric in totalitarian states such as North Korea and China under Mao Zedong. While references to the Party as the \\"vanguard of the working class\\" fell out of use, power became centered on Ceauşescu's prerogative to issue orders to the political apparatus.Cioroianu, p.418-421 The choice of the term was also meant to highlight a symbolic connection with the Princes of Wallachia and the Princes of MoldaviaBerry, p.14; Gallagher, p.61 (another comparison in use was that between Ceaușescu and the Dacian leaders of Antiquity).Gallagher, p.61 Additionally, during the same period, Communist sources began depicting Antonescu in a favorable light. Starting from a model applied to the entire Eastern Bloc by Polish political scientist Andrzej Korboński, differentiating Communist leaderships in types of primus inter pares (collective leadership) and primus (personal rule), Cioroianu concluded that Romania's choice for the latter alternative was most likely based on local political tradition.Cioroianu, p.422-423 In Cioroianu's view, Ceaușescu's system drew its other major source of legitimacy from political clientelism (resulting in what he called \\"an orbital political system\\").Cioroianu, p.426-432 The new political relations, largely based on the Conducător's charisma, were likened to various other dictatorial regimes of the 20th century, and included by Houchang Esfandiar Chehabi and Juan José Linz among the various \\"Sultanistic regimes\\"– the title itself has drawn comparisons with other ones created by dictatorial leaders for themselves: Aryamehr (used by Iran's Mohammad Reza Pahlavi), Mobutu Sese Seko Kuku Ngbendu Wa Za Banga (in Joseph-Désiré Mobutu's Zaire), the Imperial designation of Central Africa (under Jean-Bédel Bokassa), Benefactor de la Patria (imposed by Rafael Leónidas Trujillo in the Dominican Republic), and Conqueror of the British Empire etc. (in Idi Amin's Uganda).Chehabi & Linz, p.13-15 ==Influence== Several Serbian sources have repeatedly alleged that the Croatian politician , a member of the League of Communists of Croatia inside Communist Yugoslavia and a confidant of President Josip Broz Tito, was an active campaigner for Croatian independence.MacDonald, p.191-192 Among other allegations, Krajačić was accused of having adopted the nickname \\"Conducător of Separatism\\", as a compliment to Ceaușescu's dictatorial stance.MacDonald, p.192 ==NotesReferences== *David Berry, The Romanian Mass Media and Cultural Development, Ashgate Publishing, Aldershot, 2004 *Henry E.

In Romanian grammar, the words expressing numbers are sometimes considered a separate part of speech, called (plural: ), along with nouns, verbs, etc. (Note that the English word \\"numeral\\" can mean both the symbols used for writing numbers and the names of those numbers in a given language; also, Romanian only partially overlaps in meaning with English number.) Nevertheless, these words play the same roles in the sentence as they do in English: adjective, pronoun, noun, and adverb. This article focuses on the mechanism of naming numbers in Romanian and the use of the number names in sentences. The symbols for numbers in Romanian texts are the same as those used in English, with the exception of using the comma as the decimal separator and the period or the space (ideally a narrow space) for grouping digits by three in large numbers. For example, in Romanian 1,5 V means one and a half volts, and 1.000.000 or 1 000 000 means one million. ==General characteristics== As in other numeral systems, the Romanian number names use a limited set of words and combining rules, which can be applied to generate the name of any number within sufficiently large limits. The general characteristics of the number formation rules in Romanian are: *The numeration base used is decimal. *Word order is big-endian with the exception of numbers from 11 to 19. *Large numbers use a combined form of the long and short scales. *Connection words are used in certain situations. *Some number names have two gender-specific forms. ==Cardinal numbers== Cardinal numbers are the words we use for counting objects or expressing quantity. Number name for 0 The number 0 is called . Like in English, it requires the plural form of nouns: \\"zero degrees\\", with being the plural form of ). Unlike English, the reading of number/numeral 0 is always and never replaced with words like oh, naught, nil, love, etc. Numbers from 1 to 10 The number names from 1 to 10 derive from Latin. The table below gives the cardinal numbers in Romanian and the three other Balkano-Romance languages (sometimes considered to be its dialects): Aromanian, Megleno-Romanian and Istro-Romanian. {  ! Number !! Romanian !! Aromanian !! Megleno-Romanian !! Istro-Romanian  Latin -  1  unu1  unu1  unu1  ur1  unus -  2  doi1  doi1  doi1  doi1  duo -  3  trei  trei  trei  trei  tres -  4  patru  patru  patru  påtru  quattuor -  5  cinci  ținți2  ținți  ținț  quinque -  6  șase  șase  șasi  șåse  sex -  7  șapte3  șapte  șapti  șåpte  septem -  8  opt  optu  uopt  opt  octo -  9  nouă  noauă  nou  devet4  novem -  10  zece  zațe  zeți  deset4  decem } ;Notes 1\\\\. When counting, the number names for 1 and 2 have the forms given in the table; however, when used in a sentence, they change according to the gender of the noun they modify or replace. It is worth noting that the two adjectival forms of the cardinal number for 1 ( and ) are identical with the corresponding indefinite articles. * \\"one boy, a boy\\", * \\"one of the boys\\", * \\"one girl, a girl\\", * \\"one of the girls\\", * \\"two boys\\", * \\"two girls\\". 2\\\\. The name for number five in Aromanian, written or , might be responsible for nicknaming the Aromanians țințar. 3\\\\. Sometimes pronounced as (initially a regionalism), more common when communicating telephone numbers, in order to avoid a possible confusion between and . 4\\\\. In Istro-Romanian, depending on the speaker, some number names are replaced with their Croatian (Slavic) equivalents. Numbers from 11 to 19 Unlike all other Romance languages, Romanian has a consistent way of naming the numbers from 11 to 19. These are obtained by joining three elements: the units, the word (derived from Latin \\"over\\", but now meaning \\"towards\\" in Romanian), and the word for \\"ten\\". For example, fifteen is , which literally means \\"five over ten\\". This is the only exception to the big- endian principle of number naming. The table below gives the forms of all nine such number names. Each number in the series has one or more shortened variants, often used in informal speech, where the element ' is replaced by . Prescriptive grammarians consider the informal variants to be indicative of careless speech. {  ! Number !! Formal Romanian !! Informal Romanian !! Aromanian -  11  unsprezece  unșpe  unsprăd̦ațe -  12  doisprezece1  doișpe  doisprăd̦ațe -  13  treisprezece  treișpe  treisprăd̦ațe -  14  paisprezece2  paișpe  pasprăd̦ațe -  15  cincisprezece3  cinșpe (not cincișpe)  tsisprăd̦ațe -  16  șaisprezece2  șaișpe  șasprăd̦ațe -  17  șaptesprezece  șapteșpe, șaptișpe  șaptesprăd̦ațe -  18  optsprezece4  optișpe, optâșpe/optîșpe, opșpe  optusprăd̦ațe -  19  nouăsprezece  nouășpe  naosprăd̦ațe } ;Notes 1\\\\. The number name for 12 given in the table is the masculine form; this is the only number in this range that also has a feminine form: (informal ). However, the masculine form is sometimes used even with feminine nouns, especially when the number follows the noun it determines, as in \\"12 o'clock\\" or (\\"12th grade\\", see below for ordinal numbers); such use is considered incorrect. 2\\\\. Number names for 14 and 16 do not exactly follow the forming rule, possibly under the influence of the number names for 12 and 13. The forms and do exist, but are perceived as hypercorrect and very rarely used (one might hear them in telephone conversations, for the sake of correct transmission). 3\\\\. Instead of sometimes is used. 4\\\\. The number name for 18 is notorious for being the word in Romanian with the longest consonant cluster (five consonants with no intervening vowels): , split into two syllables, . For this reason, the variants (with a missing ) and or (with an additional vowel to break the consonant cluster) are frequent. Mioara Avram, Gramatica pentru toți, second edition, Humanitas Publishing House, Bucharest, 1997 Numbers from 20 to 99 The numbers in this range that are multiple of 10 (that is, 20, 30, ..., 90) are named by joining the number of tens with the word (the plural of ), as shown in the table below. Note that they are spelled as a single word. {  ! Number !! Romanian !! Aromanian -  20  douăzeci  yinghiț3 -  30  treizeci  treid̦îți -  40  patruzeci  patrud̦îți -  50  cincizeci1  țind̦îți -  60  șaizeci2  șaid̦îți -  70  șaptezeci  șaptid̦îți -  80  optzeci1  opd̦îți -  90  nouăzeci  naud̦îți } ;Notes 1\\\\. is often pronounced (but not written) . Similarly, is often pronounced . 2\\\\. does not follow the formation rule exactly. The expected form does not exist. 3\\\\. This is a direct descendant of Latin , which did not survive in Daco-Romanian. The other numbers between 20 and 99 are named by combining three words: the number of tens, the conjunction \\"and\\", and the units. For example, 42 is . For those numbers whose unit figure is 1 or 2 the corresponding number name has two gender-dependent forms: *masculine: \\"31 men\\"; \\"32 men\\"; *feminine: \\"31 women\\"; \\"32 women\\"; *neuter: \\"31 degrees\\"; \\"32 degrees\\". Short versions The numbers from 20 to 99 also have an informal, simplified pronunciation: The part shortens to when the units name starts with an unvoiced consonant or a vowel. For 50 and 80 this contraction is incomplete, reducing only to . When the next word starts with a voiced consonant the same rule applies except that is pronounced voiced as . The same rule applies if the units number is 0 and if the next word is the preposition . Examples: * → (\\"75\\"); * → (\\"51\\"); * → (\\"88\\"); * → (\\"32\\"); * → (\\"20 times\\"). In regional speech further simplification is possible ( becoming and becoming ). Also, the number , when it refers to the revolutions of 1848, is pronounced , which also gave words like (meaning \\"participant in the Romanian 1848 Revolution\\" or \\"supporter of its ideology\\"). Numbers from 100 to 999 Any given number from 100 to 999 can be named by first saying the hundreds and then, without any connecting word, the two-digit number of tens and units; for example, 365 is trei sute șaizeci și cinci. Note that the word for \\"hundred\\" is sută, and that if the number of hundreds is 2 or larger, the plural sute is required. The noun sută itself is feminine and as such the numbers 100 and 200 are o sută and două sute. In fast utterances, the numbers 500 and 800 are usually pronounced cinsute and opsute, instead of the standard forms cinci sute and opt sute, respectively. In writing, however, the informal variants are only used for stylistic effects. Large numbers The table below lists the numbers representing powers of 10 larger than 100, that have a corresponding single- word name. The word for 1000 is feminine, all the others are neuter; this is important in the number naming. In Romanian, neuter nouns behave like masculine in the singular and like feminine in the plural. {  ! Number !! Singular !! Plural -  100 o sută  (două) sute -  1.000  o mie  (două) mii -  1.000.000  un milion  (două) milioane -  1.000.000.000  un miliard, un bilion  (două) miliarde, bilioane -  1.000.000.000.000  un trilion  (două) trilioane -  1.000.000.000.000.000  un cvadrilion (occasionally triliard)  (două) cvadrilioane (occasionally triliarde) -  1.000.000.000.000.000.000  un cvintilion  (două) cvintilioane -  1.000.000.000.000.000.000.000  un sextilion  (două) sextilioane -  ...  ...  ... } To say any cardinal number larger than 1000 the number is split in groups of three digits, from right to left (into units, thousands, millions, etc.), then the groups are read from left to right as in the example below. 12,345,678 (written in Romanian 12.345.678) = douăsprezece milioane trei sute patruzeci și cinci de mii șase sute șaptezeci și opt When a digit is zero, the corresponding quantity is simply not pronounced: 101,010 (written in Romanian 101.010) = o sută una mii zece In writing, the groups of three digits are separated by dots. The comma is used as decimal separator. This may be confusing for native English speakers, who use the two symbols the other way around. Decimal fractions Numbers represented as decimal fractions (for example 1.62) are expressed by reading in order the integer part, the decimal separator, and the fractional part. This is the same as in English, with the following exceptions: *The decimal separator is the comma, in Romanian virgulă. For example, 2.5 is written 2,5 and pronounced doi virgulă cinci. *The fractional part is read as a multi-digit number, not by saying each digit independently. For example, 3.14 (written 3,14) is pronounced trei virgulă paisprezece (literally three comma fourteen). However, when the number of decimals is too large, they can be read one by one as a string of digits: trei virgulă unu patru unu cinci nouă (3.14159). *Decimal fractions whose integer part is 0 (such as 0.6) are always written and pronounced in Romanian together with the initial zero: 0,6 is read zero virgulă șase, unlike English point six. In some situations it is customary to say cu \\"with\\" instead of virgulă. For example, medical staff might be heard stating the body temperature in words like treizeci și șapte cu cinci, meaning 37.5 °C. Percents Percentages (%) and permillages (‰) are read using the words la sută and la mie, like in the examples: cinci la sută (5%), nouă la mie (9‰). For percentages an alternative reading uses the neuter noun procent, meaning 1%; the previous example becomes cinci procente. Negative numbers Negative numbers are named just like in English, by placing the word minus, pronounced , at the beginning: −10 m is minus zece metri. Preposition de Syntactically, when a cardinal number determines a noun and when the number has certain values, the preposition de (roughly equivalent to of) is inserted between the number name and the modified noun in a way similar to English hundreds of birds. Example: șaizeci de minute \\"sixty minutes\\". The rules governing the use of preposition de are as follows: *For numbers from 0 to 19 de is not used. The same applies to numbers whose last two digits make a number in the range from 1 to 19. Examples: șapte case \\"seven houses\\", șaisprezece ani \\"16 years (old)\\", o sută zece metri \\"110 meters\\". **An exception to this rule is when the objects that are counted are symbols (letters, numbers). In this case, for better understanding the meaning, de can be used, although the practice is sometimes criticized. Example: se scrie cu doi de i \\"it's written with two i's\\", doi de zece \\"two tens\\", \\"two A grades\\". **Another exception is for numbers whose last two digits are 01, in which case an optional de is sometimes used. Examples: o mie una de ori \\"1001 times\\", o sută unu de dalmațieni \\"101 Dalmatians\\". In the latter case the choice might be influenced by euphony (avoidance of the alliteration). *For integer numbers from 20 to 100, preposition de is placed between the number name and the modified noun. The same applies to numbers whose last two digits are either 00 or make a number in the range from 20 to 99. Examples: douăzeci de metri \\"twenty meters\\", o mie de ori \\"a thousand times\\". **In technical contexts, to save space, the preposition de may be dropped, especially in writing: 200 metri plat \\"200 meters sprint\\". In expressing quantities using measurement unit symbols the preposition de is never written, but usually pronounced: 24 V → douăzeci și patru de volți \\"24 V, twenty-four volts\\". *For non-integer decimal numbers de is never used: 20,5 kg (read douăzeci virgulă cinci kilograme, \\"20.5 kg\\"). *For negative numbers all the rules and exceptions above apply unchanged: −20 °C is minus douăzeci de grade Celsius, −5 m is minus cinci metri, −23,4 V is minus douăzeci și trei virgulă patru volți, etc. The preposition de is also used within the syntax of the number itself, for stating the number of thousands, millions, billions, etc.: douăzeci de mii \\"twenty thousand\\" (also note the plural mii, unlike the singular thousand in English). The rules for this de are the same as those described above: it is used when the last two digits of the number of thousands, millions, etc. are 00 or 20–99. Again, in technical contexts, this de may be dropped: treizeci milioane euro \\"thirty million euros\\". Agreement between number name and modified noun The number name and the noun it modifies must agree in number and gender. The rule for number agreement is simple: When the number is 1, the modified noun is put in its singular form, otherwise it takes the plural form, including the case of number 0 and all non-integer numbers. The gender agreement is somewhat complicated by the fact that the Romanian nouns are classified into three genders: masculine, feminine, and neuter. Specifically, the neuter gender is a combination of the other two: A neuter noun behaves like a masculine noun in the singular, and like a feminine noun in the plural. The gender has implications on the morphology of some of the grammatically connected words, including the number names. When the units digit of a number is 1 or 2, its name has two distinct forms, masculine and feminine. The only exception is unsprezece \\"eleven\\" which has only one form used for both genders. The gender agreement requires the choice of masculine number names for masculine nouns, and feminine number names for feminine nouns. For the neuter nouns the agreement is obtained by choosing the masculine name of the number not just for number 1, but for all other numbers whose units digit is 1, despite the fact that the noun behaves as feminine; for numbers whose last digit is 2 the feminine numeral is chosen. Examples: {  ! rowspan=\\"2\\"  Number !! Masculine noun !! Neuter noun !! Feminine noun -  copil \\"child\\"  scaun \\"chair\\"  oră \\"hour\\" -  1  un copil  un scaun  o oră -  2  doi copii  două scaune  două ore -  11  unsprezece copii  unsprezece scaune  unsprezece ore -  12  doisprezece copii  douăsprezece scaune  douăsprezece ore -  21  douăzeci și unu de copii  douăzeci și unu de scaune1  douăzeci și una de ore -  22  douăzeci și doi de copii  douăzeci și două de scaune  douăzeci și două de ore } ;Note 1\\\\. Although, as a neuter noun in the plural, scaune behaves like a feminine noun, the masculine form of the numeral douăzeci și unu is used. This is because unu \\"one\\" also represents a number by itself; in the singular, the neuter noun requires a masculine modifier. If the noun is also modified by an adjective, the feminine form of the adjective is used: douăzeci și unu de scaune galbene \\"21 yellow chairs\\". ==Distributive numbers== Distributive numbers are used to show how a larger quantity is divided into smaller, equal portions. These numbers are named using the cardinal number names and the word câte (or cîte, depending on the spelling convention), roughly meaning \\"each\\", but requiring a different word order. The following examples show some distributive numbers in various cases: *Punem câte patru prăjituri pe fiecare farfurie. \\"We put four cakes on each plate.\\" *Copiii merg doi câte doi. \\"The children are walking two by two.\\" *Hai să ne despărțim în grupe de câte trei. \\"Let's split in groups of three each.\\" *Au fost expuse desenele a câte doi elevi din fiecare clasă. \\"The drawings of two students in each class were displayed.\\" *Am dat formularele câte unui copil din fiecare grupă. \\"I gave the forms to one child in each group.\\" – Am dat formularele la cîte doi copii din fiecare grupă. \\"I gave the forms to two children in each group.\\" ==Collective numbers== Collective numbers are used when all members of a group are referred to by their number, like English all four wheels. Generally, for sets of more than a few elements, the word toți / toate (\\"all\\", masculine / feminine) is used together with the cardinal number. The use of the demonstrative cei / cele is optional in the nominative- accusative, but required in the genitive-dative. The genitive-dative form is tuturor celor for both genders. In the following examples note that the modified noun always has the nominative form, and that the definite article goes to the demonstrative where it is used: *nominative-accusative: **masculine: toți șapte piticii, toți cei șapte pitici \\"all seven dwarfs\\"; **feminine: toate trei fiicele, toate cele trei fiice \\"all three daughters\\"; *genitive-dative: **tuturor celor șapte pitici \\"of/to all seven dwarfs\\"; **tuturor celor trei fiice \\"of/to all three daughters\\"; *genitive (another pattern, using the preposition a): **numele a toți șapte piticii, numele a toți cei șapte pitici \\"the names of all seven dwarfs\\"; **numele a toate trei fiicele, numele a toate cele trei fiice \\"the names of all three daughters\\"; *dative (another pattern, using the preposition la): **le-am spus la toți șapte piticii, le-am spus la toți cei șapte pitici \\"I told all seven dwarfs\\"; **le-am spus la toate trei fiicele, le-am spus la toate cele trei fiice \\"I told all three daughters\\". Special words When the number is 2 or sometimes 3 or 4, special words are used instead of toți, just as the word both replaces *all two in English. The most frequent of these words are: *amândoi/amîndoi, amândouă/amîndouă \\"both\\", with the genitive-dative form amândurora/amîndurora, which does not follow the usual declension rules; *ambii, ambele (also \\"both\\", but somewhat formal); *tustrei, tustrele \\"all three\\". This and the following collective numerals are used mainly for people and reflects a rather old style. *câteșitrei/cîteștrei, câteșitrele/cîteștrele \\"all three\\"; *tuspatru \\"all four\\"; *câteșipatru/cîteșipatru \\"all four\\". ==Adverbial numbers== The adverbial number is the number used to show the repetition of a certain event, in constructions such as de cinci ori \\"five times\\". The table below shows a few examples of adverbial numbers. {  ! Number !! Adverbial number !! English -  1  o dată  once -  2  de două ori  twice -  3  de trei ori  three times (thrice) -  12  de douăsprezece ori  twelve times -  21  de douăzeci și una de ori  twenty-one times -  22  de douăzeci și două de ori  twenty-two times } For number 1 the usual form is o dată (\\"once\\", \\"one time\\"). The construction o oară is possible, but rarely used. In the plural, the adverbial numbers are formed using the preposition de, the cardinal number in the feminine, and the noun ori \\"times\\", which is the plural of the feminine noun oară. Sample sentences: *Am citit cartea de trei ori. \\"I've read the book three times.\\" *„Poștașul sună întotdeauna de două ori” \\"The postman always rings twice\\" Approximate numbers can be used, like in the examples below. *ți- am spus de zeci de ori că nu mă interesează. \\"I've told you dozens (textually: tens] of times I'm not interested.\\" *Am ascultat cîntecul acesta de sute de ori. \\"I've listened to this song hundreds of times.\\" ==Multiplicative numbers== For some numbers, special words are used to show multiplication of size, number, etc. The table below gives the most frequent such words, with their English equivalents. {  ! rowspan=\\"2\\"  Number !! colspan=\\"2\\"  Multiplicative number !! rowspan=\\"2\\"  Adverbial equivalent !! rowspan=\\"2\\"  English - ! traditional !! neologism -  2  îndoit  dublu  de două ori mai (mult)  double, twice as (much) -  3  întreit  triplu  de trei ori mai (mult)  triple, three times as (much) -  4  împătrit  cvadruplu  de patru ori mai (mult)  quadruple, four times as (much) -  5  încincit  cvintuplu  de cinci ori mai (mult)  quintuple, five times as (much) -  10  înzecit  -  de zece ori mai (mult)  ten times as (much) -  100  însutit  -  de o sută de ori mai (mult)  a hundred times as (much) -  1000  înmiit  -  de o mie de ori mai (mult)  a thousand times as (much) } The traditional multiplicative numbers are formed from the respective cardinal number with the prefix în- (changed into îm- when the following sound is a bilabial plosive), and the suffix -it, the same used to form the past participle of a large category of verbs. In contemporary Romanian the neologisms are more frequently used. The multiplicative number can be used as adjective and as adverb. Examples: *Adjective (note the gender agreement): **salariu întreit, salariu triplu (\\"triple wage\\", \\"wage three times as much\\"); **putere întreită, putere triplă \\"three times more power\\". *Adverb (no agreement required): **Am muncit întreit. Am muncit triplu. \\"I worked three times harder.\\" **Am economisit înzecit față de anul trecut. \\"I saved ten times as much as last year.\\" Often instead of the multiplicative numbers an adverbial construction is used. This can be applied for any number larger than 1. *Am muncit de trei ori mai mult față de anul trecut și am primit un salariu de zece ori mai mare. \\"I worked three times more than last year and earned a salary ten times bigger.\\" ==Fractional numbers== Numbers expressed as parts of a unit (such as \\"two thirds\\") are named using the cardinal number, in its masculine form, with the suffix -ime. Other morphological changes take place, as shown below. {  ! Number !! Name !! Notes -  1/2  (o) doime  Also: o jumătate and, by haplology, , , -  1/3  (o) treime  -  1/4  (o) pătrime  Also: un sfert -  1/5  (o) cincime  -  1/6  (o) șesime  -  1/7  (o) șeptime  -  1/8  (o) optime  -  1/9  (o) noime  -  1/10  (o) zecime  -  1/100  (o) sutime  -  1/1000  (o) miime  -  1/1,000,000  (o) milionime  } A number like 3/5 is expressed as trei cincimi \\"three fifths\\". Since all the fractional number names behave like feminine nouns, when the numerator is 1, 2, or any other number with a distinct feminine form, that form must be used: două treimi (2/3). The preposition de is used depending also on the numerator: douăzeci de sutimi (20/100), o sută zece miimi (110/1000). In music several other such words are frequently used for note lengths: *șaisprezecime \\"sixteenth note\\"; *trezecișidoime \\"thirty-second note\\" - often pronounced treijdoime (informal); *șaizecișipătrime \\"sixty-fourth note\\" - often pronounced șaișpătrime (informal). Fractions involving larger numbers tend to become hard to read. Especially in mathematics it is common to read fractions only using cardinal numbers and the words pe or supra (\\"on\\", \\"over\\"). For example, două treimi \\"two thirds\\" becomes doi pe trei or doi supra trei. ==Ordinal numbers== The ordinal number (linguistics) is used to express the position of an object in an ordered sequence, as shown in English by words such as first, second, third, etc. In Romanian, with the exception of number 1, all ordinal numbers are named based on the corresponding cardinal number. Two gender-dependent forms exist for each number. The masculine form (also used with neuter nouns) ends in -lea, whereas the feminine form ends in -a. Starting from 2 they are preceded by the possessive article al / a. Examples: *Am terminat de scris _al treilea_ roman. \\"I finished writing the third novel.\\" *Locuim la _a cincea_ casă pe dreapta. \\"We live in the fifth house on the right.\\" Basic forms The basic forms of the ordinal number are given in the table below. All other forms are made using them. {  ! rowspan=\\"2\\"  Number !! colspan=\\"2\\"  Ordinal number !! rowspan=\\"2\\"  Meaning - ! masculine !! feminine -  1  primul (întâiul/întîiul)  prima (întâia/întîia)  \\"the first\\" -  2  al doilea  a doua  \\"the second\\" -  3  al treilea  a treia  \\"the third\\" -  4  al patrulea  a patra  \\"the fourth\\" -  5  al cincilea  a cincea  \\"the fifth\\" -  6  al șaselea  a șasea  \\"the sixth\\" -  7  al șaptelea  a șaptea  \\"the seventh\\" -  8  al optulea  a opta  \\"the eighth\\" -  9  al nouălea  a noua  \\"the ninth\\" -  10  al zecelea  a zecea  \\"the tenth'' -  100  al o sutălea  a o suta  \\"the one hundredth\\" -  1000  al o mielea  a o mia  \\"the one thousandth\\" -  106  al un milionulea  a o milioana  \\"the one millionth\\" -  109  al un miliardulea  a o miliarda  \\"the one billionth\\" -  ...  ...  ...  ... } 11-19 Ordinal numbers in this range can be formed by modifying the corresponding cardinal number: the ending -zece is transformed into -zecelea and -zecea for the masculine and feminine ordinal number. Examples: *al unsprezecelea, a unsprezecea \\"the 11th\\"; *al doisprezecelea, a douăsprezecea \\"the 12th\\", note the gender difference doi-, două-; *al treisprezecelea, a treisprezecea \\"the 13th\\", and so on. 20-99 Ordinal numbers in this range that have the unit digit 0 are formed by replacing the ending -zeci of the corresponding cardinal number with -zecilea and -zecea (masculine and feminine): *al douăzecilea, a douăzecea \\"the 20th\\"; *al treizecilea, a treizecea \\"the 30th\\", and so on. When the unit digit is not 0, the cardinal number is used for the tens and the ordinal number for the units. The only exception is when the unit digit is 1; in this case, instead of primul, prima a different word is used: unulea, una. Examples: *al douăzeci și unulea, a douăzeci și una \\"the 21st\\"; *al douăzeci și doilea, a douăzeci și doua \\"the 22nd\\"; *al douăzeci și treilea, a douăzeci și treia \\"the 23rd\\", and so on. All other numbers The general rule for ordinal number formation is to combine the following elements: *the possessive article al, a; *the cardinal number without the last pronounced digit; *the ordinal number corresponding to the last pronounced digit. Examples: *101st: al o sută unulea, a o sută una; *210th: al două sute zecelea, a două sute zecea; *700th: al șapte sutelea, a șapte suta; As seen in the last example above, the ordinal form of the plural of 100, 1000, etc. is needed for this process. These forms are: {  ! rowspan=\\"2\\"  Number !! colspan=\\"2\\"  Ordinal number - ! masculine !! feminine -  n × 100  sutelea  suta -  n × 1000  miilea  mia -  n × 106  milioanelea  milioana -  n × 109  miliardelea  miliarda -  ...  ...  ... } Examples with large numbers: *1500th: al o mie cinci sutelea, a o mie cinci suta; *2000th: al două miilea, a două mia; *17,017th: al șaptesprezece mii șaptesprezecilea, a șaptesprezece mii șaptesprezecea *20,000th: al douăzeci de miilea, a douăzeci de mia; *2,000,000th: al două milioanelea, a două milioana; *2,000,000,000th: al două miliardelea, a două miliarda; *5,500,000,000th: al cinci miliarde cinci sute de miloanelea, a cinci miliarde cinci sute de miloana *8,621,457,098th: al opt miliarde, șase sute douăzeci și unu de milioane, patru sute cincizeci și șapte de mii, nouăzeci și optulea; a opt miliarde, șase sute douăzeci și una de milioane, patru sute cincizeci și șapte de mii, nouăzeci și opta Reverse order In certain situations the word order in expressing the ordinal number is reversed. This occurs when the object is not necessarily perceived as an element in a sequence but rather as an indexed object. For example, instead of al treilea secol the expression secolul al treilea \\"third century\\" is used. Note that the noun must have the definite article appended. Other examples: *etajul al cincilea \\"fifth floor\\"; *partea a doua \\"second part, part two\\"; *volumul al treilea \\"third volume, volume three\\"; *grupa a patra \\"fourth group\\". For simplification, often the cardinal number replaces the ordinal number, although some grammarians criticize this practice: The form secolul douăzeci is seen as an incorrect variant of secolul al douăzecilea \\"20th century\\". For number 1, the form of the ordinal number in this reverse-order construction is întâi (or întîi), in both genders: deceniul întâi \\"first decade\\", clasa întâi \\"first grade\\". For the feminine, sometimes întâia is used, which until recently used to be considered incorrect by normative works. The same reverse order is used when naming historical figures: *Carol I (read Carol Întâi); *Carol al II-lea (read Carol al Doilea). As seen above, ordinal numbers are often written using Roman numerals, especially in this reverse order case. The ending specific to the ordinal numbers (-lea, -a) must be preserved and connected to the Roman numeral with a hyphen. Examples: *secolul al XIX-lea \\"19th century\\"; *clasa a V-a \\"5th grade\\"; *volumul I, volumul al II-lea \\"volume I, II\\". ==Pronunciation== In the morphological processes described above, some pronunciation changes occur that are usually marked in writing. This section gives a few details about those pronunciation aspects not \\"visible\\" in the written form. Non-syllabic \\"i\\" The letter i in the word zeci (both as a separate word and in compounds), although thought by native speakers to indicate an independent sound, is only pronounced as a palatalization of the previous consonant. It does not form a syllable by itself: patruzeci \\"forty\\" is pronounced . The same applies to the last i in cinci: , including compounds: 15 is pronounced and 50 is . However, in the case of ordinal numbers in the masculine form, before -lea the nonsylabic i becomes a full syllabic i in words like douăzecilea \\"20th\\" and in cincilea \\"5th\\" . Semivocalic i does not change its quality: trei , treilea , treia .  Stress  The stress in numbers from 11 to 19 is on the units number, that is, the first element of the compound. Since in all nine cases that element has the stress on its first syllable, the compound itself will also have the stress on the first syllable. The same is valid for the informal short versions: *unsprezece , unșpe (11); *șaptesprezece , șapteșpe (17); Numbers in the series 20, 30, ..., 90 have the normal stress on the element -zeci. However, a stress shift to the first element often occurs, probably because that element carries more information: *treizeci (30); *„șaizeci? – Nu, șaptezeci!” \\"Sixty? – No, seventy!\\" ==Etymology== With few exceptions, the words involved in the formation of Romanian number names are inherited directly from Latin. This includes the names of all the non-zero digits, all the connecting words (și, spre, de), most of the words and prefixes used to express the non-cardinal types of numbers (toți, ori, al, în- etc.), and part of the multiple names (zece, mie). The remainder are largely relatively recent borrowings from French, such as zero, dublu, triplu, minus, plus, virgulă, milion, miliard, etc., most of which are used internationally. But the most remarkable exception is the word sută, whose origin is still debated. It is possibly an old Slavic borrowing, although the phonetic evolution from sŭto to sută proves hard to explain. A Persian origin has also been suggested.Alexandru Ciorănescu, Dicționarul etimologic român, sută, Universidad de la Laguna, Tenerife, 1958–1966 ==Usage== Dates. Calendar dates in Romanian are expressed using cardinal numbers, unlike English. For example, \\"the 21st of April\\" is 21 aprilie (read douăzeci și unu aprilie). For the first day of a month the ordinal number întâi is often used: 1 Decembrie (read Întâi Decembrie; upper case is used for names of national or international holidays). Normally the masculine form of the number is used everywhere, but when the units digit is 2, the feminine is also frequent: 2 ianuarie can be read both doi ianuarie and două ianuarie; the same applies for days 12 and 22. Centuries. Centuries are named using ordinal numbers in reverse order: \\"14th century\\" is secolul al paisprezecelea (normally written secolul al XIV-lea). Cardinal numbers are often used although considered incorrect: secolul paisprezece. See above for details. Royal titles. Ordinal numbers (in reverse word order) are used for naming ruling members of a monarchy and the Popes. For example: Carol al II- lea, Papa Benedict al XVI-lea. See above for details. ==Particularities== Banknote labeled \\"una sută lei\\" (2005 issue). *In Romanian, a number like 1500 is never read in a way similar to English fifteen hundred, but always o mie cinci sute \\"one thousand five hundred\\". *Sometimes, the numbers 100 and 1000 are spelled out as una sută and una mie, instead of the usual o sută, o mie. This is to ensure that the number of hundreds or thousands is understood correctly, for example when writing out numbers as words, mostly in contexts dealing with money amounts, in forms, telegrams, etc. For example, the 100 lei note is marked with the text \\"UNA SUTĂ LEI\\". Such a spelling is very formal and used almost exclusively in writing. *The title of the book Arabian Nights is translated into Romanian as O mie și una de nopți (textually One thousand and one nights), using the conjunction și although not required by the number naming rules. ==See also== *Names of numbers in English ==NotesReferences== *The Number System of Romanian *Numbers in Indo-European Languages *Detailed Romanian grammar with a section on numerals (PDF, 183 pages, 4.6 MB) * DEX online, a collection of Romanian dictionaries. * Web DEX online, web 2.0 Romanian dictionaries. * Narcisa Forăscu, \\"Grammar difficulties of the Romanian language\\": use the index on the left and select the terms \\"numerale\\" and \\"de (prepoziție)\\". * Capidan, Theodor.

He was MP for Huddersfield West from 1979 until the seat was abolished in 1983. He was then elected for Littleborough and Saddleworth and held the seat until his death in 1995. Dickens is known for his anti-paedophile work, including the naming of diplomat Sir Peter Hayman, as a paedophile in the House of Commons. ==Early life== Dickens was born in London and fostered until he was eight years old. He never had contact with his mother afterwards. He was educated at schools at East Lane in Wembley and at Acton Technical College. He suffered polio when he was 13, for which he had to spend two years in hospital. During his youth Dickens became a heavyweight boxer, sparring with Don Cockell and Henry Cooper. He had 60 bouts, of which he won 40. He worked as an Aviation Design Draughtsman at BSP Industries in Borehamwood, Herts, whom he represented as a talented goalkeeper; he became a member of St Albans Rural District Council from 1967–74, and was its chairman in 1970–71. He also was a member of Hertfordshire County Council in 1970–1975. In 1972 Dickens was awarded the Royal Humane Society's Testimonial on Vellum after he saved two boys and a man from drowning in the sea off Majorca. ==Member of Parliament== A Conservative politician, Dickens fought unsuccessfully for Middlesbrough in February 1974 and for Ealing North in October 1974. He won Huddersfield West in 1979 but this seat was abolished after boundary reviews. He was selected as the Conservative candidate for Littleborough and Saddleworth, which he won in 1983. Described as \\"Falstaffian\\" and \\"the original 'rent-a-quote' man\\", over his time in parliament he campaigned for causes as diverse as the return of hanging and the banning of teddy bears. He indicated in a 1987 BBC Heart of the Matter documentary that consideration should be given to re-criminalising homosexuality to prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS, Citation given for this statement is Dickens on Heart of The Matter, BBC 1, March 1987. and opposed the Lesbian and Gay Christian Movement (LGCM) and ordination of gay priests. He once held a press conference announcing an affair without, apparently, warning his wife. He served on the Commons Energy Select Committee. ==Paedophile ring investigation== Between 1981 and 1985, Dickens campaigned against a suspected paedophile ring he claimed to have uncovered that was connected to trading child pornography. In 1981, Dickens named the former British High Commissioner to Canada, Sir Peter Hayman, as a paedophile in the House of Commons, using parliamentary privilege so he could not be sued for slander. Dickens asked why he had not been jailed after the discovery on a bus of violent pornography. In 1983, Dickens claimed there was a paedophile network involving \\"big, big names – people in positions of power, influence and responsibility\\" and threatened to name them in the Commons. The next year, he campaigned for the banning of Hayman's Paedophile Information Exchange organisation. Dickens had a thirty-minute meeting with the Home Secretary, Leon Brittan, after giving him a dossier containing the child abuse allegations. Although Dickens said he was \\"encouraged\\" by the meeting, he later expressed concern that PIE had not been banned. On 29 November 1985, Dickens said in a speech to the Commons that paedophiles were \\"evil and dangerous\\" and that child pornography generated \\"vast sums\\". He further claimed that: \\"The noose around my neck grew tighter after I named a former high-flying British diplomat on the Floor of the House. Honourable Members will understand that where big money is involved and as important names came into my possession so the threats began. First, I received threatening telephone calls followed by two burglaries at my London home. Then, more seriously, my name appeared on a multi-killer's hit list\\". Dickens' son later said that about the time when the dossier was given to the Home Secretary, the MP's London flat and constituency home were both broken into but nothing was taken, presumably in a search for documents. The Labour MP Tom Watson asked the Home Office in February 2013 for Dickens' dossier. A Home Office review in 2013 concluded that any information requiring investigation was referred to the police but revealed that Mr Dickens' dossier was \\"not retained\\". After the issue had been raised again by Labour MP Simon Danczuk in July 2014, former Director of Public Prosecutions, Lord Macdonald, said the circumstances in which the dossier had gone missing were alarming and recommended an inquiry into the fate of the dossier. Prime Minister David Cameron asked the Home Office Permanent Secretary to investigate what had happened to the missing dossier.

Founded in 2001, JCHS is a pluralistic Jewish high school. ==History==  Founding  The idea for a pluralistic Jewish high school serving the Bay Area was initially conceptualized by Nancy Zimmerman Pechner, a local artist, in 1997. Zimmerman partnered with Noah's Bagels-founder Noah Alper, who would become JCHS's first board president, to open the school in the fall of 2001. Tom Lorch was the original head of school, before turning the reins over to Larry Fischer. Fischer, who served as principal of a Connecticut high school of 19 years, resigned after the end of the school's first year.JCHS head to leave, principal is promoted March 1, 2002 Rabbi Edward Harwitz, the school's principal, was promoted to fill Fischer's position.

The brush cuckoo is native to Malesia, New Guinea, the Solomon Islands and northern and eastern Australia. It is a grey-brown bird with a buff breast. Its call is a familiar sound of the Australian bush. ==Taxonomy== Twelve subspecies have been recognised: * Cacomantis variolosus addendus (Rothschild & Hartert, 1901) – Solomon Islands. * Cacomantis variolosus aeruginosus (Salvadori, 1878) – Central Maluku Islands (Sula Islands, Buru, Ambon, Seram). * Cacomantis variolosus blandus (Rothschild & Hartert, 1914) – Admiralty Islands. * Cacomantis variolosus dumetorum (Gould, 1845) – northern Australia. * Cacomantis variolosus everetti (Hartert, 1925) – Sulu Archipelago. * Cacomantis variolosus infaustus (Cabanis & Heine, 1863) – North and south Maluku Islands (Morotai, Tidore, Ternate, Halmahera, Bacan, Obi, Seram Laut, Watubela, Kai), western Papuan Islands (Gebe, Waigeo, Salawati, Kofiau, Misool, Gorong), Biak, northwest and northern New Guinea east to the Sepik River and islands northeast of New Guinea as far as Umboi. * Cacomantis variolosus macrocercus (Stresemann, 1921) – Bismarck Archipelago except Admiralty Islands and New Hanover. * Cacomantis variolosus oreophilus (Hartert, 1925) – Eastern and southern highlands of New Guinea. * Cacomantis variolosus sepulcralis (S. Müller, 1843) – Tanintharyi Region of southern Myanmar, Thailand, Malay Peninsula, Sumatra, Java, Borneo, Lesser Sunda Islands to Philippines. * Cacomantis variolosus variolosus (Vigors & Horsfield, 1827) – southeastern Australia. * Cacomantis variolosus virescens (Brüggemann, 1876) – Sulawesi, Buton, Tukangbesi, Banggai, Peleng. * Cacomantis variolosus websteri (Hartert, 1898) – New Hanover. Most are geographically isolated, though some come into contact outside of the breeding season. For example, on Seram, members of the nominate subspecies variolosus join the local aeruginosus during the southern hemisphere winter. The convention of uniting the subspecies under C. variolosus dates back at least to Peters' checklist, but there is uncertainty about whether they all belong there or not. For example, some ornithologists treat sepulcralis as a species in its own right (the Rusty-breasted cuckoo). Likewise, aeruginosus is elevated by some to species level (the Moluccan cuckoo), but is placed by others under C. sepulcralis. Some ornithologists treat infaustus as part of C. variolosus and others as part of C. sepulcralis. The uncertainty arises because differences between the subspecies in characteristics such as plumage colour can be minimal, while differences in vocalisations are often significant. ==Description== The brush cuckoo is about long. The plumage of adult males and females is similar. The head is pale grey, the breast is buff, the back is grey-brown, and the underside of the tail is brown with white tips and bars. The eye has a narrow, pale ring around it, and the feet are olive- pink. Juvenile plumage is heavily barred dark brown. The wings are sharply pointed and backswept in flight. Underwings are grey-brown with pale buff underwing coverts and a white or pale buff bar. The brush cuckoo has a similar appearance to the pallid cuckoo, and especially the fan-tailed and chestnut- breasted cuckoo. ==Distribution and habitat== The brush cuckoo is found in northern and eastern Australia, the Solomon Islands, New Guinea, Malaysia, and other islands to the north of Australia. It is resident in parts of its range, such as in Thailand, peninsular Malaysia, Cambodia and southern Vietnam, the Philippines, the Greater Sunda Islands, Lesser Sunda Islands, the Maluku Islands and Timor. It may migrate locally in New Guinea and northern Melanesia. In Australia, it is migratory in the southern part of its range. In Australia, it is known to inhabit a range of environments including rainforests, rainforest edges, mangrove forests, secondary forests, and plantations. ==Ecology== The brush cuckoo is a brood parasite and across its Australian range uses at least 58 other species as hosts, though major hosts are Ramsayornis spp. and the scarlet robin, leaden flycatcher and grey fantail. Its eggs are polymorphic, meaning females lay specific egg types for specific hosts. in Australia, females lay three types of egg depending on their major host in the relevant region of their distribution. Brush cuckoo chicks evict the host eggs or chicks from the nest once they hatch. ==Media== Song Kobble Creek, SE Queensland, Australia ==ReferencesExternal links== * ABID Images * On the HBW Internet Bird Collection brush cuckoo brush cuckoo Category:Birds of Malesia Category:Birds of New Guinea Category:Birds of the Solomon Islands Category:Birds of Australia brush cuckoo ","title":"Brush cuckoo"},{"id":"5556780","text":"Per (\\"Pelle\\") Anders Gustaf Holmertz (born 3 February 1960 in Motala, Östergötland) is a former freestyle swimmer from Sweden.

Loyden was Member of Parliament (MP) for Liverpool Garston from February 1974 until he lost the seat to the Conservatives in May 1979. However, favourable boundary changes allowed him to be re-elected in 1983, and he remained MP for Liverpool Garston until he retired in 1997. ==Early years== He was born in 1923 into a large, working-class family living in Portland Street off Vauxhall Road, Liverpool. His father Patrick was a van driver for Tate and Lyle. On leaving school, Eddie worked for a cobblers in the Scotland Road area, but from a young age he wanted to be a seafarer and he would often cycle to the docks to try to get work. At the age of fifteen he got employment as a deck boy on a coaster, leaving his bike at the docks. His mother knew nothing of this until she received a telegram from his new employer. ==Politics== He spent the Second World War in the Merchant Navy and saw many friends perish at sea. After the war he worked for the Mersey Dock and Harbour Board and became chairman of his branch of the Powers Workers Union, later part of the Transport and General Workers Union. He joined the Labour Party and was elected to Liverpool City Council in 1960. His maiden speech focused on the plight of the unemployed and the poor housing conditions that still existed in the City of Liverpool. He was involved in the seamen's strike of 1966, despite Harold Wilson’s denigration of the strikers as a \\"tightly knit group of politically motivated men\\". In 1974 Loyden was elected MP for the Garston area of Liverpool, a former traditional Tory seat. His majority was small, and he lost the seat to Malcolm Thornton in 1979 and went on to be elected as City Councillor for the St Mary's ward in Garston, going on to become deputy Leader of the City Council. In 1983 he was re-elected to Parliament, and also in 1987 with a vastly increased majority. In the 1980s and 1990s he campaigned for the families of the seamen of the MV Derbyshire, which sank in Typhoon Orchid in 1980. He retired in 1997.

It is included in the BWV catalog under the number 246. Now it appears in the catalogues under the heading apocryphalAmazon item or anonymous. ==History== A surviving manuscript of the St Luke Passion from about 1730 is partly in Bach's hand, though scholars believe that the music is certainly not his own. The music was later thought to have been composed by Johann Melchior Molter, but that was proven false because if Molter composed the music, then the manuscript would date to later than 1730. Presumably Bach performed it, or intended to perform it, in Leipzig. C. P. E. Bach and Agricola may have mistaken it for a work of Bach's and thus included it in their census. Of course, given his delight in exhaustive cycles, Bach should have composed a St Luke Passion. Apparently J. S. Bach took the anonymous St Luke Passion and arranged it for four voices, chorus, orchestra, and continuo to meet an urgent deadline for Good Friday in 1730. ==Authenticity== With regard to the authorship of the passion, Felix Mendelssohn commented in a letter to Franz Hauser who had just paid a large sum of money to purchase the Lukaspassion: \\"I am sorry to hear you have given so much money for the St. Luke Passion.\\" Mendelssohn repudiated Bach's authorship of the work upon the evidence of a single chorale, 'Weide mich und mach' mich satt' (No. 9).

Except for the 1976–79 Deeply Vale Festivals, Bickershaw was the only major north-west multi-day festival with camping. The organisers of the Deeply Vale Festivals say the Bickershaw Festival inspired them to put on a north-west music festival with camping. ==History== The Bickershaw Festival was assembled under the auspices of a Manchester businessmen, a Wigan market trader and Jeremy Beadle, before he achieved fame as a television presenter. Jeremy booked the West Coast bands and was artistic policy maker. Chris Hewitt of Ozit Morpheus Records and manager of Tractor, worked with Jeremy and was involved in distribution of publicity and tickets. Although the organisers put together a line-up of United Kingdom and American acts such as the Grateful Dead, Captain Beefheart, New Riders of the Purple Sage, Dr. John, Hawkwind, The Kinks, Country Joe McDonald, The Incredible String Band, Donovan, Wishbone Ash, Maynard Ferguson, and a host of non-musical acts such as Cheech & Chong, high divers and clowns, the festival suffered from several major deficiencies. The artist line-up was inspirational to many of the audience, including teenager Joe Strummer who said it was his favourite concert, especially the late-night set from Captain Beefheart. Elvis Costello stood in the mud amazed by the five-hour set from the Grateful Dead, the performance which convinced him he should start a band. Future rock journalist and rock biographer Mick Middles, then age 16, travelled there on a moped just to watch the Grateful Dead on the Sunday. There were problems. The site was prone to flooding and there was standing water. The weather was wet: It rained before the festival opened and then showered for most of the three days of the festival. A tank used by a high- dive act was emptied directly onto the area in front of the stage, resulting in a sea of mud. Security on the gates was inefficient. Tickets were taken and resold to those who were entering the site or were not checked. Festival goers simply got passouts and sold their ticket at half price to people arriving. As a consequence the organisers lost money. By Sunday, all semblance of organization had disappeared and locals wandered freely onto the site to watch the Grateful Dead. By this time much of the site was awash with mud. ==See also== *List of historic rock festivals *List of jam band music festivals ==ReferencesExternal links== *Personal account of Bickershaw Category:Music festivals in Greater Manchester Category:Counterculture festivals Category:1972 in England Category:1972 in British music Category:Rock festivals in England Category:Music festivals established in 1972 Category:Jam band festivals Category:1972 music festivals ","title":"Bickershaw Festival"},{"id":"5556809","text":"Baotian Motorcycle Industrial Co.

Shortly after Samantha Mulder was abducted and then returned, Jeffrey and Samantha were raised together by his father in California. Spender met Agents Fox Mulder and Dana Scully in 1998. The same year, the \\"Cigarette Smoking Man\\" began sending him letters; however Spender returned them unopened. After his father set fire to The X-Files in \\"The End\\", Spender with Agent Diana Fowley start working on the X-Files. Spender got orders from the \\"Cigarette Smoking Man\\" to push and eventually get Mulder and Scully fired from the FBI, which he eventually does in \\"Two Fathers\\". Later on he reinstates Mulder and Scully to The X-Files but is shot in the head and apparently killed by his father in \\"One Son\\". Three years later it is revealed in \\"William\\", that he survived the gunshot, but was subjected to horribly disfiguring experiments at the hand of his father. Posing as Mulder, he infiltrated Scully's house, and injected William with a magnetite substance to seemingly \\"cure\\" the baby of his telekinetic powers. The motivation or repercussions of his actions are never fully explained. He testified for the defense during Mulder's murder trial in \\"The Truth\\". He also revealed during the trial that Teena Mulder was having an affair with the \\"Cigarette Smoking Man\\", and that he and Fox Mulder are half-brothers. A DNA test conducted on a disfigured Spender in the episode \\"William\\" initially led agents Scully, Doggett and Reyes to believe he was Mulder thus lending further credence to Spender's claim that both he and Mulder are the children of the \\"Cigarette Smoking Man\\". He reappears in \\"My Struggle III,\\" having received reconstructive surgery. He warns Mulder and Scully that government agents are seeking out William. == Conceptual history ==  Creation and early development  Chris Owens had previously portrayed the Cigarette Smoking Man in the episodes, \\"Musings of a Cigarette Smoking Man\\" and \\"Demons\\", he had portrayed The Great Mutato in \\"The Post-Modern Prometheus\\" on the show before being cast as Spender. Owens had also landed a guest role on The X-Files spin- off Millennium. Chris Carter and David Duchovny were so pleased with his portrayal of The Great Mutato that he was picked for the role, without making an audition. Most of the crew members reacted positively to the selection. When creating the character of Spender, Carter had no long term plans for Owens involvement, meaning that Spender's involvement wouldn't differ much from different previous recurring characters of the show. Michal Suchanek made a small cameo appearance in \\"The Red and the Black\\" as a young version of Spender. However, as the fifth season's production period entered its final months, rumors began to circulate – especially among the production crew members in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada – about the future of the series, particularly concerning whether the show would be moving to Los Angeles, California for the sixth season and whether the new recurring character of Jeffrey Spender was planned (in case David Duchovny cut back his commitment to the series) to become a replacement for Duchovny's character of Fox Mulder – either as a part-time or full-fledged substitute. Other, contradictory rumors that Owens heard were that either he or Duchovny would appear in only eight episodes of the sixth season and that his casting as Spender was a sign that the series would either be leaving Vancouver or staying there. According to the actor himself, he always knew that Duchovny would not be leaving the series but only discovered that The X-Files would indeed be moving to Los Angeles when the official announcement was made. According to Owens, he first learned of Spender's seeming demise in \\"One Son\\" via the usual way - when Chris Carter phoned the actor to discuss his latest script - and, upon Carter telling him that Jeffrey Spender would make an heroic exit from the series' story arc, Owens questioned himself about this news as he was slightly unable to believe that he was leaving the series so soon. Apparently, the news of Spender's departure from the series was confirmed for him shortly thereafter, however, when he received the episode's script. When it came time to film Spender's final scene in \\"One Son\\", actor William B. Davis became upset, saying that he didn't want to shoot Owens and adding that he enjoyed working with the actor. On the other hand, Davis had no trouble with slapping Owens, in a scene of \\"Two Fathers\\" in which Spender is twice hit by the Cigarette Smoking Man.  Later development in Season 9  {class=\\"toccolours\\" style=\\"float: right; margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 2em; font-size: 90%; background:#c6dbf7; color:black; width:37em; max-width: 40%;\\" cellspacing=\\"5\\"  left;\\"\\"That makeup job that Owens endured probably took maybe six hours. Cheri Metcalfe, she would come up with these designs and sketches and bring them to myself and Chris [Carter] and Frank [Spotnitz], and the three of us would pow-wow with Vince Gilligan and John Shiban, and most of those makeup decisions or any creative decision were really kind of done or decided as a team.\\" -  left;\\" — Kim Manners talking about Owens make-up job during his return to the last season. } Three years after Spender had been written out of the series and actor Chris Owens had moved to Toronto, Ontario, Canada, Owens received an unexpected phone call from David Duchovny, who said that The X-Files production crew was filming the series' finale as well as another episode late in the season, and that he wanted to bring Spender back for these two episodes. Duchovny reassured Owens that Spender's survival of the shooting years earlier could be explained away via the plot device of an alien injection but mentioned that the experience would not be fun for Owens, as he would be \\"under all that shit\\"; Owens did not realize what Duchovny meant until he got to the studio and saw the makeup for Spender's disfigured appearance, a sight that shocked Owens. == Reception == Entertainment Weekly writer Ken Tucker called Chris Owens portrayal of Spender \\"gloriously stiff- necked\\". Lon Grahnke from The Chicago Sun-Times responded positively to the character, calling Spender \\"devious\\". Shortly after the premiere of \\"Terms of Endearment\\", Owens started to notice \\"strange reactions\\" from people on the street. He assumed their odd expressions were those of \\"annoyance\\" with his character because of his actions. One day, one particularly aggravated fan of the series actually shook his finger at Owens and called him a \\"Paper shredder!\\". == References == Category:The X-Files characters Category:Fictional Federal Bureau of Investigation personnel Category:Television characters introduced in 1998 ","title":"Jeffrey Spender"},{"id":"5556829","text":"Stephen Richards Source: Library and Archives Canada Stephen Richards (1820 – October 4, 1894) was a lawyer and political figure of Ontario, Canada.

To the right of the Sacred Tomb in the Basilica of the Holy Sepulchre is the Chapel of Saint Mary Magdalene, which opens into the 10th-century Chapel of the Apparition of Christ to His Blessed Mother, served by the Franciscan fathers and containing their choir. Just off this chapel is the small damp monastery that 13th century has been the abode of the Fathers of the Holy Sepulchre. The band is chosen every three months from the Monastery of Saint Saviour, to lead the difficult confined life. Nonetheless, they always finds eager volunteers. The convent is accessible only from the basilica, which under Ottoman rule was in charge of Muslim guards. The keys which lock the basilica shut the friars off from the outer world leaving their only means of communication as aperture in the main portal, through which they receive provisions from Saint Saviour's. Every afternoon the fathers conduct a pilgrimage to the sanctuaries of the basilica, and at midnight, while chanting their Office, they go in procession to the tomb of the Saviour, where they intone the Benedictus. Austrian Emperor Franz Joseph, in 1869, on his way to the opening of the Suez Canal, visited the Holy Land. He conferred numerous benefactions on Saint Saviour's, and induced the Ottoman Empire to remove the stable which obstructed the light and air of the little monastery of the Holy Sepulchre. He also convinced the Turks to permit the erection of a bell-tower. On 25 September 1875, these bells pealed forth for the first time in 700 years summoning the faithful to worship in the Church of the Holy Sepulchre. The superiors must be alternately Italian, French, and Spanish. The rest of the community of Saint Saviour's generally numbers about 25 Fathers and 55 lay brothers. They are engaged in the various activities of the convent, located within the monastic enclosure. In the early 20th century, besides the church of Saint Saviour (the Latin parish church of Jerusalem) the convent included an orphanage, a Catholic parish school for boys, a printing office, carpenter's and ironmonger's shops, a mill run by steam, and the largest library in Jerusalem. ==See also== * Custody of the Holy Land * Order of the Holy Sepulchre * Brotherhood of the Holy Sepulchre ==References== Category:Custody of the Holy Land Category:Calvary ","title":"Fathers of the Holy Sepulchre"},{"id":"5556879","text":"Kenneth Eastham (born 11 August 1927) is a British Labour politician.

The Art of Dreaming. New York: HarperCollins, 1993. It details events and techniques during a period of the author's apprenticeship with the “Yaqui“ Indian Sorcerer, don Juan Matus, between 1960 and 1973. ==Summary== The Art of Dreaming describes the steps needed to master the control and consciousness of dreams. The Toltecs of Don Juan Matus' lineage believed that there are seven barriers to awareness, which they termed The Seven Gates of Dreaming. In The Art of Dreaming Castaneda describes extensively how a state called Total Awareness can be achieved by means of dreaming. According to Castaneda there are 7 Gates of Dreaming, or obstacles to awareness, which when overcome yield total awareness. Four of the Gates of Dreaming are discussed in The Art of Dreaming. What follows is not so much a technique in achieving lucidity, but rather the practical application of lucid dreaming. By acting a certain way while dreaming, one can cause psychosomatic changes in one's being, including an alternate way of dying. What follows is a point-form summary of the philosophy surrounding Toltec dreaming as a way of \\"Sorcery that is a return to Paradise\\". * 1st Gate of Dreaming (stabilization of the dreaming body): Arrived at when one perceives one's hands in a dream. Solved when one is able to shift the focus from the hands to another dream object and return it to the hands, all repeated a few times. Crossed when one is able to induce a state of darkness and a feeling of increased weight while falling asleep. Location in the body – in the area at the base of the V formed by pulling the big and second toes of one foot to the sides. * 2nd Gate of Dreaming (utilizing the dreaming body): Arrived at when one's dream objects start changing into something else. Solved when one is able to isolate a Scout and follow it to the realm of Inorganic Beings. Crossed when one is able to fall asleep without losing consciousness. It is also referred to the activity of dreaming together with other practitioners. Location in the body – in the inside area of the calf. * 3rd Gate of Dreaming (traveling): This is what is often known as an \\"Out of body experience\\". Arrived at when one dreams of looking at oneself. Solved when the dreaming and physical bodies become one. Crossed when one is able to control the dreaming body in the physical realm and move around at ease. Location in the body – at the lowest part of the spinal column. * 4th Gate of Dreaming (sharing): This is the last gate explained in the book as such, and crossing it consists of being able to share the intended dream reality of other people. One has to have gathered enough strength into the dreaming body through the previous gates in order to travel to other people's dreams. ==See also== * Carlos Castaneda * Carlos Castaneda bibliography * Astral travel * Dream argument * Lucid dreaming * Trance state ॐ ==References== Category:1993 non-fiction books Category:Books about dream interpretation Category:HarperCollins books Category:Lucid dreams Category:New Age books Category:Works by Carlos Castaneda ","title":"The Art of Dreaming"},{"id":"5556892","text":"\\"The Sexuality of Bereavement\\" is a song by death/doom metal band My Dying Bride.

Membership is primarily open to serving and retired teachers, university students undertaking education degrees and diplomas that will qualify them as registered school teachers, other employees in the Australian education sector, and immediate family members of people who fit the primary criteria. As a mutually owned institution, each member (account holder) holds one equal share in the organisation and all profits are intended to be returned to members by way of lower fees and interest rates than those available from commercial banks and other for-profit financial institutions. Initially formed in 1967 as the New South Wales Teachers Credit Union, with membership restricted to public (state) school teachers in New South Wales, the membership of Teachers Mutual Bank is today spread across New South Wales, the Australian Capital Territory, Western Australia, South Australia and the Northern Territory. Having always had a highly decentralised membership (their teacher members working in schools spread across the state), the bank was an early innovator in providing banking services with telephone and, later, internet banking. It currently maintains six core branches; three located in Sydney (one being the head office) and one in each of the Hunter Region, the Australian Capital Territory and Western Australia.

He was elected Member of Parliament (MP) for Manchester Central at a by-election in September 1979, and held the office until he retired at the 1997 general election. == Early life == Litherland was born to a working-class family in Collyhurst, Manchester. His father was an engineer and his mother was a mill worker. He attended a grammar school but left at the age of fifteen to train as a bookbinder, going on to be a sales representative for a printing company. He was active in the trade union the Society of Graphical and Allied Trades (Sogat) and joined the Labour party at sixteen. == Career == Litherland was elected to Manchester City Council in 1971 for the ward of Harpurhey. He became chairman of the council's direct works committee, overseeing slum clearance. A believer in municipal socialism, he took pride in the improvements to council housing in the city and revealed a cartel fixing the price of cement.  Member of Parliament  After Labour's defeat in the 1979 general election, Harold Lever, the MP for Manchester Central, was made a life peer, leading to the first by-election of that parliament. The first MP sponsored by Sogat, Litherland won the Labour nomination and was elected that September by a majority of 5,992. A left- winger, he welcomed Michael Foot's successful Labour party leadership bid and sponsored Tony Benn in his failed 1981 deputy leadership challenge. He would later support Eric Heffer and John Prescott in their leadership bids. In 1981, a year after the beginning of the Soviet–Afghan War, he made a controversial fact-finding visit to Kabul with two other Labour MPs. After a five-day stay he concluded that Babrak Karmal's government should be recognised but that Soviet forces should leave Afghanistan. Litherland worked hard for his constituents. In 1982 he protested to ministers about poor conditions at Strangeways prison and in 1983 he demanded an inquiry into poor-quality tower blocks. After boundary changes in 1983, his local popularity meant he was selected for the redrawn Manchester Central seat over frontbencher Charles Morris, whose Manchester Openshaw seat had been abolished. He was re-elected with a majority of nearly 20,000. He chose to retire from politics when he reached retirement age, stepping down as an MP at the 1997 general election. This meant that despite spending eighteen years in Parliament he never served as a government MP. == Political beliefs == Litherland was a staunch socialist and held some radical beliefs. However, he realised that Labour needed to pursue popular policies in order to gain power and that socialists had to co- operate to succeed. He was a member of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament and opposed the deployment of troops to the Falklands War. He opposed Conservative Party laws on trade unions and criticised Margaret Thatcher for promoting democracy abroad, such as during her visit to Poland, while suppressing unions at home. == Personal life == Litherland married his wife Edna in 1953. They had two children, five grandchildren and three great- grandchildren. He died in May 2011 after living with cancer for ten years. == References == *Times Guide to the House of Commons, Times Newspapers Limited, 1992 and 1997 editions. == External links == * Category:1930 births Category:2011 deaths Category:Graphical, Paper and Media Union-sponsored MPs Category:Labour Party (UK) MPs for English constituencies Category:Politicians from Manchester Category:UK MPs 1979–1983 Category:UK MPs 1983–1987 Category:UK MPs 1987–1992 Category:UK MPs 1992–1997 ","title":"Bob Litherland"},{"id":"5556945","text":"The Diogenidae are a family of hermit crabs, sometimes known as \\"left-handed hermit crabs\\" because in contrast to most other hermit crabs, its left chela (claw) is enlarged instead of the right.

She made a strong impression among Kentish Tories, and in 1964 was shortlisted ahead of 104 applicants, almost all men, to succeed Harold Macmillan at Bromley. She missed out in the final selection, then again at Brighton Kemp Town where the party was seeking — and would fail — to overturn a Labour majority of seven. Instead she was adopted for the unwinnable Newcastle-under-Lyme . After unsuccessfully fighting Newcastle- under-Lyme in 1966, Fenner was elected MP for Rochester and Chatham at the 1970 general election. Rochester and Chatham Conservatives selected her to take on the Left-wing Labour MP Anne Kerr, and in 1970 she bettered the national swing to capture the seat by 5,341 votes. Both candidates bemoaned the fact that the other could not have found a man to defeat somewhere else, and when Peggy Fenner arrived in the Commons it was women's issues that she took up. Her first success was to force the Royal Navy to scuttle a “dial a sailor” scheme for the public to befriend sailors docking away from their home port, after Navy wives complained. She joined other Tory women in trying to amend the recently liberalised divorce laws which ended the right of the “innocent party” to veto divorce after five years. Her work on the Expenditure Select Committee impressed, and in November 1972 Heath appointed her Parliamentary Under-Secretary for Agriculture with responsibility for prices, which were becoming an issue as inflation set in. Peggy Fenner served as Parliamentary Secretary at the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, with responsibility for food, from November 1972 to February 1974 under Edward Heath, and again from September 1981 to September 1986 under Margaret Thatcher. Upon leaving the government in 1986 she was appointed a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire. At MAFF she took through the legislation obliging food producers to put sell-by dates on their products, but spent most of her time tackling a rising tide of complaints about higher meat prices, caused by a world shortage, and explaining a 48 per cent increase in food prices in three years. When Labour's Willie Hamilton complained of being charged 5p for a banana, she told him curtly: “You could certainly do with some help with your shopping. I bought six bananas for 17p recently, and I don’t have time to shop around.” Hamilton was back next week saying he had now been charged 16½p for three bananas. In the February 1974 election called by Heath over the miners’ strike, Peggy Fenner fought a tight battle with Roger Kenward, Labour, and her majority slumped to 843. In opposition, she joined Britain's contingent in the then-nominated European Parliament. She attended only a handful of sessions before Harold Wilson called another election and Labour's Bob Bean ousted her by 2,418 votes. She was out of the Commons for Mrs Thatcher's overthrow of Heath, and as the Tories regrouped for a return to government. She won back Rochester and Chatham in 1979, by 2,688 votes. John Nott's decision to close Chatham dockyard was a blow to Peggy Fenner's constituents, many of whom took it out on their MP. And before she could launch a campaign against the closure, Mrs Thatcher, in September 1981, gave her back her old job at MAFF. Prices were now less of an issue, so she could address concerns over quality: the conditions in which veal calves and battery hens were kept, the amount of fat in mince and water in sausages, dyes in pet food, tighter curbs on pesticides, pesticide residues on lemons that were polluting gin-and-tonics, and the unsuitability of cling film for microwave cooking. She also presided over the first raising of the Thames Barrier. At the 1983 election the Rochester and Chatham seat was abolished and Fenner was elected MP for the new constituency of Medway. She continued to hold the seat for the next fourteen years, being re-elected at the 1987 and 1992 general elections, until she lost it at the 1997 election to Labour's Bob Marshall-Andrews. On the death of Baroness Jeger in 2007, Fenner became the oldest living woman to have served as an MP in the United Kingdom. Mrs Thatcher dropped her in September 1986 in a cull of junior ministers, compensating her with a DBE. Dame Peggy became a leading campaigner against the high speed link across Kent to the Channel Tunnel. For a decade from 1987 she returned to Strasbourg as a delegate to the Council of Europe and Western European Union. The 1997 election brought boundary changes and a heavy national swing to Labour. Dame Peggy, her 75th birthday approaching, went down by 5,354 votes to the colourful barrister Bob Marshall-Andrews. ==Personal life== Born on 12 November 1922 in Lewisham, London, as Peggy Edith Bennett, she was cared for in infancy by her grandparents. Her parents divorced when she was three and she never saw her father again. Educated at a London County Council elementary school in Brockley, Kent she went on to attend Ide Hill School in Sevenoaks but left aged 14 going into service. In 1940 aged 18 she married architect Bernard Fenner and went into wartime factory work. The couple had one daughter. Her husband Bernard Fenner and their daughter predeceased her. She died on 15 September 2014. ==References== * \\"Times Guide to the House of Commons\\", Times Newspapers Limited, 1979 and 1997 editions. * == External links == * Category:1922 births Category:2014 deaths Category:Conservative Party (UK) MPs for English constituencies Category:Female members of the Parliament of the United Kingdom for English constituencies Category:UK MPs 1970–1974 Category:UK MPs 1974 Category:UK MPs 1979–1983 Category:UK MPs 1983–1987 Category:UK MPs 1987–1992 Category:UK MPs 1992–1997 Category:Dames Commander of the Order of the British Empire Category:Conservative Party (UK) MEPs Category:MEPs for the United Kingdom 1973–1979 Category:Place of birth missing Category:20th-century British women politicians Fenner ","title":"Peggy Fenner"},{"id":"5556989","text":"William Julius Mann (1819–1892) was an American Lutheran theologian and author, born in Stuttgart, Germany.

Temple. It starred Stephen Murray, Barbara Payton and James Hayter. It was produced by Hammer Film Productions at Bray Studios. The film dealt with the moral and scientific themes (not to mention \\"mad lab\\" scenes) that were soon to put Hammer Films on the map with the same director's The Curse of Frankenstein. Four Sided Triangle has most in common with Fisher's Frankenstein Created Woman (1967). ==Plot== Dr. Harvey, a rural physician, breaks the fourth wall to relate an unusual occurrence that happened in his village. The bulk of the story is told in flashback. Bill and Robin are boyhood friends who compete for the affections of Lena, a beautiful girl about their own age. Lena's family moves away, and in adulthood the two men become scientists. They collaborate on the Reproducer, a machine that can exactly duplicate physical objects. Lena returns to the village, and Bill and Robin's forgotten childhood feelings return. In time, they abandon their work on the Reproducer, and Robin leaves the village to learn his family's business. Bill is disappointed to discover that Lena loves Robin and intends to marry him. Hopeless that he can win Lena's affections, Bill convinces her to allow him to use the Reproducer to create a duplicate of her. The experiment succeeds, and Bill names the duplicate \\"Helen\\". Because Helen is an exact copy, when she is introduced to Robin she also falls in love with him. Bill believes that electro-shock therapy can be used to erase Helen's knowledge of Robin. Not wishing to compete with Lena for Robin's affections, Helen agrees to the therapy. Bill convinces Lena to help him with the procedure. The process proceeds as planned, but the apparatus overheats, explodes and causes a terrific fire. Robin and Dr. Harvey arrive in time to rescue a woman from the fire. Bill and the other woman perish in the flames. Harvey, having been briefed on the situation by Robin, discovers that the woman has amnesia. The two men wonder whom they have saved. Dr. Harvey recalls that Bill had had to start Helen's heart with a device that he attached to the back of her neck, leaving two scars. Robin is relieved to find that there are no marks on the neck of the woman they rescued: It is Lena. ==Production details== Four Sided Triangle was an early effort by Hammer Films. The laboratory set includes \\"a welter of retorts, alembics, rheostats and plain, old neon tubing\\". This chaotic, improvised laboratory setting has been contrasted with the sophisticated labs portrayed by Universal Horror pictures of the 1930s. The picture relies on a minimum of trick photography and special effects, which may have been compromised by its limited budget. Two days of the five-week schedule were filmed in August, 1952, at Lulworth Cove, and photographed for Picture Post magazine of the 30th. of August, that year by George Douglas. ==Differences from the novel== Four Sided Triangle features some differences from the original novel by William F. Temple. In the novel, the duplicate (named Dorothy and nicknamed Dot) falls into depression for being married with Bill while she's in love with Robin. She has a breakdown and has to go on holiday with Bill to recover. When they return, Bill starts working on a power generator which explodes, killing him. Lena tries to convince Robin to accept both her and Dot, but he refuses. A couple of weeks later, Lena and Dot have an accident while diving in a river. One of them dies and the other is seriously injured. Dr. Harvey and Robin are startled when they discover that the surviving woman can't recall anything after the duplication, and suppose she's repressing all the painful memories, so she must be Dot. Dr. Harvey finds in Bill's notes about the marks on Dot's neck and tells Robin, convincing him that the survivor is Lena.In an epilogue, he reveals that he also discovered a note in which Bill recalls that, during her holiday, Dot had undergone plastic surgery to erase the marks, but destroyed it so Robin and Dot can be happy. ==Cast== * Barbara Payton (Lena Maitland/Helen) * James Hayter (Dr. Harvey) * Stephen Murray (Bill Leggat) * John Van Eyssen (Robin Grant) * Percy Marmont (Sir Walter) * Glyn Dearman (Bill as a child) * Sean Barrett (Robin as a child) * Jennifer Dearman (Lena as a child) * Kynaston Reeves (Lord Grant) * John Stuart (Solicitor) * Edith Saville (Lady Grant) ==References== Sources Hearne, Marcus & Jonathan Rigby.

Perry Lake is a US Army Corps of Engineers operated reservoir in northeast Kansas. Its primary purposes are flood control, water reserve for nearby areas and regional recreation. The lake is approximately 11,150 acres (45 km²) in size, with over of shoreline. Perry Lake's full multi-purpose pool elevation is above sea level. Perry Lake is located about west of Kansas City, just northwest of Lawrence, Kansas. Its close proximity to Kansas City, Lawrence, and the state capitol, Topeka, make it a very popular destination, with the nickname \\"Paradise on the Plains\\". ==History== The dam was constructed on the Delaware River to help control flooding downstream in both the Delaware and Kansas rivers. Completed in 1966, the rolled earth fill dam is long and rises to in height above the stream bed, abating flooding for over of northeast Kansas. In 1968 the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers reached a long term land usage lease with the Kansas Parks and Resources Department, allowing for the development of Perry State Park. ==Geography== Perry Lake is located at (39.1773424, -95.4516964) at an elevation of . It lies in northeastern Kansas in the Dissected Till Plains region of North America's Central Lowlands. The entirety of the reservoir lies within Jefferson County. The reservoir is impounded at its southern end by Perry Dam. The dam is located at (39.1138886, -95.4252525) at an elevation of . The Delaware River is both the reservoir's primary inflow from the north and outflow to the south. Smaller tributaries include Duck Creek, French Creek, and Rock Creek from the west and Little Slough Creek, Slough Creek, and Evans Creek from the east. U.S. Route 24 runs generally east-west approximately south of the dam. Kansas Highway 237 runs generally north-south from U.S. 24 into Perry State Park. There, it becomes West Lake Road, crossing the lake's southwestern arm, and then it turns to the west. Ferguson Road, a paved county road, runs generally north-south east of the reservoir, crossing its southeastern arm. Kansas Highway 92, which runs east- west, crosses the northern portion of the reservoir. Several settlements lie on or near the reservoir. The largest is its namesake, the community of Perry, located on the Delaware River a few miles south of the dam. Ozawkie lies on the western shore at the lake's northern end. To the east and south of Ozawkie, a number of unincorporated communities lie on both sides of the lake. In order from north to south, these are: Lake Shore, Lakewood Hills, and Lakeside Village on the eastern shore and Indian Ridge, West Shore, Hilldale, Hilldale South, Lake Ridge, and Hickory Acres on the western shore. Thompsonville lies immediately south of the lake at the west end of the dam. ==Hydrography== The surface area, surface elevation, and water volume of the reservoir fluctuate based on inflow and local climatic conditions. In terms of capacity, the Corps of Engineers vertically divides the reservoir into a set of pools based on volume and water level, and the reservoir is considered full when filled to the capacity of its multi-purpose pool. When full, Perry Lake has a surface area of , a surface elevation of , and a volume of . When filled to maximum capacity, it has a surface area of , a surface elevation of , and a volume of . The streambed underlying the reservoir has an elevation of . Since the reservoir's initial flooding, sedimentation has gradually accumulated on the reservoir bottom thus raising its elevation. ==Activities== Perry State Park, located along the southwest part of Perry Lake, offers a wide variety of water recreation and outdoor activities: *Boating: Boats and personal watercraft of all types are allowed. No limits are placed on horsepower, however boaters must follow all applicable state laws. Three marinas and multiple boat launch ramps are available around Perry Lake. *Camping: The Army Corps of Engineers Slough Creek Campground offers 265 campsites in a mix of walk-in tent sites, sites with full electrical and water hookup, and two large designated group campsites. Perry State Park offers a further 102 campsites with full utility hookups and over 200 primitive campsites. Cabin rentals are also available from the state park. *Equestrian activities: Perry State Park and the public use Corps of Engineers land has over 25 miles of horse trails for exploration. Primitive camping is allowed at select locations along the trails. *Fishing: Bassmaster.com has named Perry Lake one of America's 100 best bass lakes. In addition to the white bass and largemouth bass, many other species of fish are also available to anglers including bluegill, channel catfish, crappie, sauger, and walleye. *Hike/Bike trails: Nine bike trails of varying length and difficulty are provided.

Maungatautari is a mountain, rural community and ecological area near Cambridge in the Waikato region in New Zealand's central North Island. The New Zealand Ministry for Culture and Heritage gives a translation of \\"mountain of the upright stick\\" for . The Maungatautari Restoration Project is the largest ecological restoration project in New Zealand. The project is engineered to remove all non-native pest mammals and predators and restore endangered native flora and fauna to Maungatautari. There is no intention to restrict all introduced birds, but efforts will be made to control exotic wasps. It includes private land and a government-owned scenic reserve administered by Waipa District Council. It is a community project managed by the Maungatautari Ecological Island Trust. Maungatautari Marae and Te Manawanui meeting house located on the northern edge of the mountain, overlooking the Waikato River. It is a meeting place for the Ngāti Korokī Kahukura hapū of Ngāti Hourua and Ngāti Ueroa,the Ngāti Raukawa hapū of Ngāti Korokī and Ngāti Mahuta and the Waikato Tainui hapū of Ngāti Korokī and Ngāti Raukawa ki Panehākua. It is the main marae for the, Taute, Kara, Tupaea, Wirihana, Poka and Tauroa whānau, among others. Waniwani Pā is also a traditional meeting ground for the Ngāti Korokī Kahukura hapū of Ngāti Waihoro. ==Ecological area== Silver beech discovered at Maungatautari in April 2006. Maungatautari is an eroded andesitic volcano. It was chosen as a suitable site for the project for a number of reasons, including the diversity of its terrain, the relative integrity of natural areas in spite of some human engineered changes, the commitment of surrounding communities, and the feasibility of fence-construction given surrounding developed terrain. Some elements of the diversity of Maungatautari took scientists by surprise. In April 2006, the discovery of 100 silver beech trees caused considerable excitement in the botanical community. The tree, native to southern New Zealand, had not previously been believed to be present on Maungatautari, although researchers who came to investigate emphasized that the tree had probably been established during the last ice age. The largest of the trees were estimated to be several centuries old. Jim Mylchreest, Maungatautari Trust's chief executive, pointed out that the trees were not only exciting in themselves, but also for the fungi and insects they might host that also may not have been expected to be present on Maungatautari. Hochstetter's frog discovered on Maungatautari December 2004. Species found In December 2004, eleven endangered Hochstetter's frogs were found living on Maungatautari in a rocky region. There had already been discussions about potentially reintroducing the Hochstetter's frog to the preserve, and the rare discovery of the small population in an environment being prepared to protect them excites the scientific community. A dead Duvaucel's gecko was found in a mouse trap in March 2010; this was the first sighting of this species on mainland New Zealand for almost 100 years, probably indicating a surviving population of the gecko within Maungatautari. Ecological restoration plan Because poisons and trapping, traditional methods of pest control, have limited success and seldom last long, the creators of the plan decided to enclose the 34 square kilometres of bush with a 47 km pest-exclusion fence to create an ecological island. When the environment is rendered suitable, the area will be repopulated with the entire suite of charismatic species that may now be locally extinct, such as North Island brown kiwi, North Island kōkako, kakariki, tuatara and many others. Kaka already visit regularly and are likely to become resident if suitable methods are employed. In November 2003, the Trust constructed two exclosures, at the north and south of Maungatautari, totalling 1.1 square kilometres. The Trust used these areas to demonstrate the fence's feasibility and to test pest removal methods, which were launched in September 2004. The exclosures are now predator-free and were used as holding areas for native species while the main fence was being built. The Xcluder pest-proof fence. In July 2004, the Trust began constructing the Xcluder fence. In September 2006 the Trust completed fencing the entire 34 square kilometres to exclude all pests (and was able to take advantage of parts of the exclosures' fencing constructed at Stage 1). Then the Trust began eliminating pests by dropping poison, starting with brodifacoum in November 2006. A second application was made in December 2006. The combined effect of the poison, trapping and hunting eliminated brown rats, black rats, stoats, cats, weasels, ferrets, red deer, fallow deer, pigs, goats, possums, hedgehogs, rabbits and hares. In 2007 the sole remaining pest species was mice, and poison was dropped a third time, in September that year, to eradicate them. This failed, and in 2011 the trust introduced a new policy, focusing on controlling rather than eradicating mice.http://www.maungatrust.org/Biodiversity_Mgt_Restoration.cfm One of the greater challenges facing the designers of the Xcluder fence adopted for the purpose was addressing entry at streams. Since water levels fluctuate and a fence needed to address both debris and fish migration, the Xcluder was outfitted with an electronic surveillance system to alert the Trust if a watergate fails to properly close. There have been other challenges with the fence, including storm damage in July 2007 that was quickly repaired. In July 2006, a viewing tower was constructed near a northern rata grove in the southern exclosure. Species reintroduction Since the beginning of the project, native species have returned to the area either naturally or through reintroduction. In July 2007, a 300% increase was discovered in the native beetle population of the southern enclosure. In December 2005 Maungatautari witnessed its first kiwi call in approximately a hundred years. Radio signals in April 2007 suggested that the kiwi may be sitting on an egg, but that nest was found to be bare. In September 2007, two kiwi eggs were discovered. Although one proved infertile, the other hatched in December 2007, the first kiwi egg known to have hatched on Maungatautari in a century. Karuwai the kiwi at August 2005 health check. In June 2006, the Trust began reintroducing species, starting with a pair of critically endangered takahē. In April 2007, three species of endangered whitebait (kokopu or native trout) were reintroduced. In May, kākā were put into a special enclosure to allow them to acclimatise before they were released; they quickly attracted wild companions. In November of that year, seven kākā were released from the aviary. On 3 December 2007 the trust announced that they planned to reintroduce North Island robins, North Island kōkako, tuatara, popokatea (whiteheads) and hihi (stitchbirds) in 2008. March 2009 saw the release of 60 whiteheads (popokatea) and 59 hihi (stitchbirds).

The fossils provide direct evidence that the three major orb weaving families, namely Araneidae, Tetragnathidae and Uloboridae, had evolved by this time, about 140 million years ago. They probably originated during the Jurassic (200-140 million years ago). All three families very likely have a common origin.

In 1992 New Zealand was admitted and the Circuit was renamed the Australasian Grand Circuit. The best horses available are brought together to race for very attractive prizemoney. With the associated opportunities for promotion and marketing, this benefits both owners and harness racing clubs as well as the industry overall. In its first season in 1977, total stakemoney for the eight races forming the Circuit was $554,020. Today total stakemoney has risen to a projected $4,805,000, spread over 16 legs for the Grand Circuit Season in 2005/2006. The Grand Circuit has eliminated date clashes of major races which so often prevented the best horses from competing against each other to the detriment of clubs and the public. Points were awarded during the Circuit, five points for a win, two points for second and one point for third. The horse with the greatest number of points is crowned Australasian Grand Circuit Winner.

He played in Major League Baseball as a second baseman from to , most notably as a member of the New York Mets with whom he won a world championship in . He also played for the Minnesota Twins and the San Diego Padres. He is currently a New York Mets minor league instructor and club ambassador. Throughout his career, Teufel was also known for his batting stance, the \\"Teufel shuffle\\", in which he wiggled his buttocks back and forth before the pitcher's delivery. ==Early life== Teufel attended St. Mary's High School in Greenwich, Connecticut, St. Petersburg Junior College in St. Petersburg, Florida, and Clemson University in South Carolina where he earned All American honors and participated in the College World Series as a senior in 1980. In 1979, Teufel played collegiate summer baseball for the Cotuit Kettleers of the Cape Cod Baseball League (CCBL). He batted .351 and set league records for home runs, RBI, and runs scored in a season. Teufel was inducted into the CCBL Hall of Fame in 2005. At age 19, he was drafted by the Milwaukee Brewers in the sixteenth round of the 1978 Major League Baseball Draft, but did not sign. Teufel was drafted by the Chicago White Sox in the third round of the secondary phase of the 1979 Major League Baseball Draft, but again did not sign. In the 1980 Major League Baseball Draft, Teufel was drafted in the second round and signed with the Minnesota Twins. ==Playing career== Minnesota Twins Teufel spent all of and with the Double-A Orlando Twins. He raised his average to .282 in , earning a mid- season promotion to the Triple-A Toledo Mud Hens. In , Teufel lit up the International League with a .323 batting average, 1.022 OPS, 27 home runs and 100 runs batted in resulting in a September call-up to the major leagues. He made his major league debut on September 3 in 13-0 drubbing at the hands of Scott McGregor and the Baltimore Orioles. Teufel went 2-for-4 and score two runs to help the last place Twins snap a five-game losing streak on September 6. On September 16, Teufel led off the game by hitting his first major league home run off Jim Gott of the Toronto Blue Jays. His second career home run came in the eighth inning of the same game. In all, Teufel went 5-for-5 with two home runs and five runs scored in arguably the best offensive game of his career. By the end of the season, the Twins surpassed the Seattle Mariners to avoid a last place finish. The following season, Teufel snatched the starting second base job away from former Rookie of the Year, John Castino. In his rookie season, Teufel had 149 hits, 30 doubles, fourteen home runs, 61 RBIs, and provided solid defense at second base for the Twins. The Twins improved to 81-81 in , which was good enough for a second-place finish in the American League West. Teufel finished fourth behind Alvin Davis, Mark Langston and teammate Kirby Puckett in American League Rookie of the Year balloting. The Twins fell back into fifth place in . Following the season, Teufel was traded with minor leaguer, Pat Crosby to the New York Mets for Billy Beane, Bill Latham and Joe Klink. New York Mets Teufel in 1986 Although Teufel had hit far better against right-handed pitchers in 1985, he was used mainly against left-handed pitchers in a platoon system with New York. Splitting time with Wally Backman, Teufel started quickly in with a go-ahead 14th inning single in his first game with the Mets (although they lost in the bottom half of the inning). His average stayed around .220 into June. On June 10, Teufel had one of the most exciting moments in the Mets championship season with a walk-off pinch-hit grand slam in the bottom of the 11th inning against the Philadelphia Phillies. The Mets' reputation as a rowdy bunch was punctuated on July 19 when Teufel, Ron Darling, Bob Ojeda, and Rick Aguilera were arrested after a bar fight with off-duty police officers in Houston, Texas. Teufel was sentenced to a year of probation and fined $200 for his part and none of the four missed any playing time, though this incident did help fuel some rivalry between the Mets and their impending 1986 National League Championship Series competitors, the Houston Astros. Teufel managed just one hit and no RBI against the Astros in the Championship Series won by the Mets in six games. In game one of the 1986 World Series against the Boston Red Sox, the Mets suffered a fate eerily similar to that which they suffered in game one of the against the Oakland Athletics, in which the usually sure handed Félix Millán committed a third inning error that led to both of Oakland's runs in their 2-1 victory over the Mets. With a runner on second and one out, Rich Gedman hit a ground ball to Teufel at second which Teufel misplayed, allowing the runner to score. Boston held on for the 1-0 victory. He hit a home run in Game five of the Series, but the Mets lost that game. For the series, Teufel batted .444 with four hits in nine at bats. The home run was the only postseason RBI and run scored of Teufel's career. was Teufel's best season statistically as he tied his 1984 home run and RBI highs despite playing in only 97 games. His .308 batting average, .398 on-base percentage and .545 slugging percentage were career-highs. Despite significantly outperforming Wally Backman, Teufel continued to be used in a platoon role. He was given the chance to play every day in , but spent all of April below .200 and missed three weeks from mid-May with an injury ,causing the platoon to be reinstated. Teufel was used in just one game in the 1988 NLCS. In , Gregg Jefferies was given most of the time at second base and Teufel spent half of his time at first base. His playing time further decreased in as he played in career-lows of 80 games with 175 at-bats while shifting between first, second and third base. San Diego Padres Teufel's average was at a paltry .118 on May 31 when the Mets traded him to the San Diego Padres for Garry Templeton.BASEBALL; Mets Send Teufel to Padres In Exchange for Templeton Teufel hit between .220 and .250 in all three seasons with San Diego while continuing to play at all three bases defensively. On April 14, , he went 5-for-5 for the second time in his career but the Padres lost the game on their way to a 101-loss season. Teufel was granted free agency and retired after the 1993 season. ==Coaching career== Teufel returned to the Mets as a roving instructor for and . He was named the manager of the Mets' Rookie-level minor league Brooklyn Cyclones for and was promoted to the Single-A St. Lucie Mets for and . After the two seasons near .500, the Mets announced Teufel was being replaced by new Baseball Hall of Fame member, Gary Carter, for . Teufel decided to take a break from baseball for the year. Teufel with the Mets in 2015 He was named manager of the Savannah Sand Gnats on January 11, , and was a Mets' representative at the 2008 Major League Baseball Draft. He returned as St. Lucie's manager in 2008 and 2009. In 2010, in his first season managing the Double-A Binghamton Mets, he led the team to a 66-76 record and a fifth-place finish in the Eastern League. He was named manager of the Buffalo Bisons in January 2011. In 2011, he was named manager of Leones del Caracas in the Venezuelan Professional Baseball League. On November 16, 2011 he was replaced as manager by Carlos Lezcano.Tim Teufel replaced as manager in Caracas Teufel returned to the New York Mets organization as the new third base coach in 2011, replacing former coach Chip Hale. He was a vital part of their 2015 World Series team as well as their 2016 Playoff team.

The second son of the 6th Marquess of Salisbury, Cecil was in Rhodesia with a freelance film-maker, Nick Downie, recording material for a television documentary about the war. Carrying a rifle and wearing a Rhodesian Army uniform, he was shot dead at close range by a member of the Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army. The Rhodesian government reported that Cecil had been \\"killed in action\\"; his body was returned to the United Kingdom for burial. The Cecil family had long-standing connections with Rhodesia. The death of Cecil was one of a number of events during 1978 that brought Rhodesia's Unilateral Declaration of Independence (UDI) to an abrupt end; it was the identity of the deceased, and the nature of his loss, that affected UDI's supporters. == Family ties == Cecil was the son of Robert Gascoyne- Cecil, 6th Marquess of Salisbury.The Guardian, 15 July 2003 :obituary of sixth Marquess of Salisbury His mother was Marjorie (Mollie) Olein Wyndham-Quin, granddaughter of the Earl of Dunraven and Mount-Earl, who had married his father in 1945.Genealogy report :aristocratic British families (extract) The Cecil family had well established links with Rhodesia, the capital city of which was named Salisbury after the third Marquess (it was renamed Harare in 1982 on the second anniversary of Zimbabwean independence). The family had extensive land holdings in the country and the fifth Marquess (Cecil's grandfather) was a leading British supporter of the white minority UDI government that ruled Rhodesia from 1965 to 1979. Cecil was the eldest of the younger brothers of Robert Cecil, Viscount Cranborne, who has been both an MP and the Leader of the House of Lords. In 2003, Cranborne became 7th Marquess of Salisbury upon the death of his father. == Education and early career == Cecil was educated at Eton College and at the Royal Military Academy, Sandhurst. After graduating from Sandhurst, he was commissioned in the Grenadier Guards. After three tours of duty in Northern Ireland (mentioned in dispatches in 1973The Times, 19 September 1973. Official Notices) he attained the rank of Captain. He decided not to pursue a career in the military and resigned his commission with a view to pursuing a career in politics. He enrolled on a degree course in politics at the University of Sussex in 1973, although it is believed that he rarely attended classes and never graduated. In July 1974, he was selected as the Conservative Party candidate for Barrow- in-Furness and contested the seat at the October 1974 general election.The Times, 25 July 1974. \\"Candidates adopted\\" During the election campaign, he complained about the restraints being placed on military action in Northern Ireland by politicians. He suggested the possibility of making military incursions into the Republic of Ireland to kill IRA members sheltering there. The sitting Labour MP defeated Cecil by 7,400 votes and there was a 3% swing from Conservative to Labour in the constituency.October 1974 general election :Barrow-in-Furness result Thereafter, he decided to become a freelance journalist while seeking a winnable Conservative seat to contest at the next election.The Times, 22 April 1978. Obituary of Lord Richard Cecil ==Journalism and Rhodesia== Cecil's military background and social connections led him to Southern Africa in the mid 1970s, at a time when political unrest in Rhodesia was leading to a state of war between the white-minority government and black nationalist guerrilla forces. He quickly established friendships with prominent Rhodesians including the Foreign Minister, P. K. van der Byl. When the Bush War against black nationalists started in earnest in 1976, Cecil used his family connections to gain access to Rhodesian army counter-insurgency operations. In particular, his friendship with \\"PK\\" allowed him access to events and locations that were off-limits to other journalists. He provided reports that were carried by a number of newspapers (including The Times and Time magazine). He also contributed reports to the British ITN TV news service. Cecil would accompany Rhodesian army units into action while himself wearing army uniform and carrying a rifle. His obituary (22 April 1978) stated that he was \\"prepared to carry a rifle ... and even to use it\\".Time magazine, 1979 :the 'Bang Gang' He ignored warnings that such conduct was inappropriate and dangerous for a journalist. Cecil was a member of a 20 strong group of correspondents known as the \\"Bang Gang\\". This group was intimately involved in the Rhodesian cause, and went about their journalistic work heavily armed. Cecil was nicknamed \\"Young Winston\\" by fellow journalists. This referred to similarities between the early careers of Cecil and Winston Churchill. The nickname was not used kindly in every case. Some of his fellow journalists considered that his conduct exposed all journalists in Rhodesia to the charge of being combatants – and being treated accordingly in certain eventualities such as capture. ==Death== On 20 April 1978, Cecil and freelance film-maker Nick Downie landed by helicopter in North East Rhodesia with an army \\"Fireforce\\" airborne unit. They both were parachute qualified and were often first and second in the stick to record the war literally first-hand. The two were recording material for use in a TV documentary they were making about the Bush War.Nick Downie report While moving through dense undergrowth, Cecil encountered a ZANLA fighter who fired at him at a range of less than 5 metres. He was hit by two bullets, first in the thigh and then in the chest, and died after a few minutes.Rory Peck Trust :list of freelance journalists killed in battle The Times, 22 April 1978. 'Journalist killed by guerrillas' – by Frederick ClearyArmy Rumour Service Full Account of Richard Cecil's death The Rhodesian Ministry of Defence reported him as being \\"killed in action\\". His body was returned to England for burial. == Aftermath == P. K. van der Byl offered the following comment upon being informed of Cecil's death : \\"Lord Richard was the finest young man I ever knew and represented the best of everything that made the Englishman great, and built the British Empire.\\" Cecil's funeral service was held at the Church of St Mary and St Bartholomew, Cranborne on 27 April.The Times, 29 April 1978. Report on funeral service A memorial service was held for him at the Guards Chapel, Wellington Barracks, on 9 May. Both events were attended by the most prominent personalities from the British aristocracy (including Lord Mountbatten of Burma), the British army and the media. The death of Cecil was one of a number of events during 1978 that brought UDI to an abrupt end. The loss of one man did not amount to much in the whole scheme of things, but it was the identity of that man and the nature of his loss that had an impact. One factor that had sustained UDI since 1965 was tacit support from some elements in the British establishment who were variously influenced by anti-communism, appreciation of the colonial era's achievements and a wish to safeguard investments. Cecil was the embodiment of that support. His death brought the UDI project into question and made certain people think very hard about the wisdom of it.The Guardian :6th Marquess obituary, 20037th Marquis biography : Heathland Heritage Centre Nick Downie completed filming of the documentary he and Cecil had been engaged in. It was broadcast by Thames Television's 30-minute TV Eye programme under the title \\"Frontline Rhodesia\\". In the 1979 British general election, Cecil's older brother Robert Cecil, Viscount Cranborne, was elected MP for South Dorset. In his maiden speech to the House, Cranborne urged Rhodesian Prime Minister Ian Smith to end UDI and accept majority rule in Rhodesia under Abel Muzorewa. ==References== Category:1948 births Category:1978 deaths Category:Younger sons of marquesses Category:People educated at Eton College Category:Alumni of the University of Sussex Richard Category:Journalists killed while covering military conflicts Category:Conservative Party (UK) parliamentary candidates Category:Deaths by firearm in Rhodesia ","title":"Lord Richard Cecil"},{"id":"5557157","text":"Sherardising is a process of galvanization of ferrous metal surfaces, also called vapour galvanising and dry galvanizing. The process is named after British metallurgist Sherard Osborn Cowper-Coles (son of naval inventor Cowper Phipps Coles) who invented and patented the method c. 1900. This process involves heating the steel parts up to c. 500 °C in a closed rotating drum that contains metallic zinc dust and possibly an inert filler, such as sand.H. G. Arlt, \\"Finishes on the Metal Parts of Telephone Apparatus\\", Bell Laboratories Record, Volume 9(4), 175 (December 1932) At temperatures above 300 °C, zinc evaporates and diffuses into the steel substrate forming diffusion bonded Zn-Fe-phases. Sherardising is ideal for small parts and parts that require coating of inner surfaces, such as batches of small items. Part size is limited by drum size. It is reported that pipes up to 6 m in length for the oil industry are sherardised. If the metal surface is free of scale or oxides, no pretreatment is needed. The process is hydrogen-free, hence hydrogen embrittlement is prevented. == Application == During and shortly after World War I, German 5 Pfennig and 10 Pfennig coins were sherardised. == Standard == BS EN 13811: 2003 (withdrawn replaced by BS EN ISO 17668:2016) Sherardizing.

The development is a joint-venture between Lewis Land and Mirvac. The island has an area of 9.6 hectares and was once covered by mangroves. The development is distinctive for inhabiting an artificial island in the Broadwater, connecting to the mainland by a 400-metre bridge. The island, its landmass sculpted into a conspicuous albeit backwards \\"e\\" from an aerial view, is divided into two sections. The southern division, the 'tail' of the \\"e\\", is covered mostly by undeveloped salt mud-lands. The design provides water frontage to every apartment. The northern 'eye' of the island has been developed to include a marina, 12 larger buildings (the largest topping 11 stories), a restaurant and up to 30 separate beach houses open to the Broadwater. The marina has a capacity of 115 berths. The island was cleared for development long before any construction began. According to locals, the area was devoid of vegetation from as far back as 1992 due to legal confrontations with concerned members of the community. In 2003, the developers (acknowledged as Mirvac and Lewisland) were given a green light by the Gold Coast City Council and started construction. The site was once the largest residential construction project in Queensland. 20% of the island has had its natural habitat preserved. The project is complete as of mid-2008.

Brown sticker conventions are considered to be difficult to defend against, and thus are permitted only at high levels of tournament play. Only highly unusual methods (HUMs) have a higher classification. A convention qualifies for a brown sticker if it fulfills any of the following criteria: # An opening bid of 2 through 3 may be weak and does not promise a known suit. # An overcall of a natural opening at the one level does not promise four cards in a known suit. # A weak two-suited bid where one of the suits by definition may be only three cards or shorter. # It is used for protection of psychic bids, or systemically required psyches. Notable exceptions are the Multi 2 diamonds (due to its popularity), a natural 1NT overcall, and cue bids on strong hands to force partner. In general, if a bid is weak (or potentially weak having multiple options) and does not promise four cards in a defined suit (when weak), then it is likely to qualify as a brown sticker convention. ==References== Category:Bridge conventions ","title":"Brown sticker"},{"id":"5557207","text":"Roger Kenneth Evans (born 18 March 1947) is a British Conservative politician.

Volume 2. Page 2630. ==Maxims==  Bidding  * If you have a choice of reasonable bids and one of them is 3NT, then bid it - known as \\"Hamman's Law\\", devised by Bob Hamman.Published among other places in English Bridge, June 2006, page 19 *Prefer majors to minors. Bid a major suit before a minor suit. They can overbid opponents at the same level, and score higher. *Prefer length to strength. A long suit, even if weaker, is often ultimately more powerful and desirable as a contract, than a short suit, however good, because long trumps will usually make tricks in the end, and they allow a greater level of control during the game. *With a misfit, bid cautiously; with a good fit, bid boldly. Avoids chasing a poor contract with a misfit, but enables a surprisingly high contract with a good fit. Card play Declarer *Eight ever, nine never. This refers to guidance for the common situation where declarer has eight or nine cards in a suit including the Ace and King, and is trying to choose a strategy for drawing the opponents' queen without losing a trick. There are two strategies - the finesse, which is 50-50 in both cases, and the drop, which relies upon the opponent who has the queen having only one or two (but not more) cards in the suit, and becomes more likely to succeed the more cards in the suit are held. Lacking any further information, the maxim suggests that optimal strategy is to finesse when holding a total of eight cards in the suit, and don't finesse but play the two top cards to cause the queen to be \\"dropped\\" if nine cards are held. Advanced players will often try to gain further information or deduce which hand holds the queen, before choosing their play. The difference in percentages is so close (the Bridge Encyclopedia states that the finesse is a 50% probability of success holding 8 cards, while the drop has a 53% holding 9 cards) that the slightest inference might influence a player to choose to finesse or to drop with nine cards. \\"Eight ever nine never\\" refers only to when declarer can afford no loser in the suit: there are many more things for him to think about when declarer can afford a loser. For example, if the finesse would land in the hand of the dangerous opponent who can give the other opponent a ruff that declarer can't afford, with eight cards he might have to play for a \\"drop\\" by playing the ace and king then a small one to the jack. Even if the finesse would have lost, now the dangerous opponent can't give his partner a ruff, because he can't have any more trumps left (if the queen didn't fall under the ace and king, the potential ruffer can't have more than two cards in the suit). Defenders *If in doubt, lead a spade. This applies to NT contracts and works on the assumption that declarer or dummy would likely bid spades if they had them. (Because it is axiomatic to consider a major suit fit if one exists, before settling on no trumps, and spades as the highest ranked suit are the suit which would have been easiest to bid had a fit existed.) *Cover an honour with an honour. May set up a trick for partner, or prevent the opposition making a 'free' extra trick. Example: Suppose declarer (South) leads the Queen of a suit, dummy (North) has the Ace, and the hand in between (West) has the King. If West fails to play the King over the Queen, declarer will allow the Queen to make a trick, and then the Ace will also make a second trick. By playing the King, one ensures that declarer must use the Ace and Queen on the same trick, and cannot make a second trick with these cards. In addition, partner may now turn out to have the Jack doubleton, which will now be a master. The same thing happens with partner having 10 to three cards or 9 to four cards. Their 10 or 9 will never make a trick if you don't cover. However, it is best to use your judgment: if the bidding or previous play suggests that partner can't have the jack, 10 or 9, or enough cards for this card to be promoted (e.g. if he can only have two cards and you know declarer has the jack, his 10 will still fall under one of declarer's cards whether you cover or not) then there is no point covering, as this will only help declarer by telling him where an important card is. *Play into weakness and play through strength. Two versions on a similar theme: Gives partner more opportunity to take advantage of possible finessing situations (since partner will play after the strong hand). Likewise it may give partner more opportunity for tricks, or to win with a lower card, if the last hand (after he/she plays a card) is known to be weak in the suit played. By leading into strength, you are finessing your partner (he has to play before the strong hand). *Second hand plays low. Prevents wastage of useful cards. This is because your partner may be able to win the trick with a low card, and you don't accidentally finesse yourself. However, if you know partner can't possibly have a card capable of winning the trick and there's no reason why you don't want the lead or want the 1st player to remain on lead, don't play 2nd hand low. *Third hand plays high. Prevents opponent winning a trick cheaply and may help partner. This only applies if there will be a choice of cards to play for 4th player (silly to play your king when 4th player has a singleton ace!) and there is a possibility of promoting something for your partner. For example, he might have three cards with the jack, and 4th player has the ace and the queen. If you play your king, 4th player has to play the ace, and now the queen can't drop partner's jack: it has been promoted. ==Principles== * Principle of fast arrival. In game forcing auctions, bidding game directly with a preemptive jump bid shows a limited minimum hand and no slam interest. * Principle of restricted choice. The play of a particular card decreases the probability its player holds any equivalent card. * Useful space principle, or USP. The Bridge World glossary defines USP as: \\"a partnership's assigning meanings to actions so that the remaining bidding space matches the needs of the auction.\\" ==Rules of thumb== * Rule of Eleven * Rule of Twenty ==References== Maxims ","title":"Bridge maxims"},{"id":"5557216","text":"Philipstown may refer to: * Philipstown, Northern Cape, South Africa * Philipstown, New York, United States *A former name for Daingean, Ireland ==See also== * Phillipstown * Philipsburg Manor, spelled variously Philipse, Philipseborough, Philipsburgh, and Philipsbourg Philipse ","title":"Philipstown"},{"id":"5557221","text":"Leadwort is a common name for various flowering plants in the family Plumbaginaceae, in particular those in the genera: *Ceratostigma *Plumbago It can also refer to metallophyte plants capable of tolerating high levels of lead, such as spring sandwort Minuartia verna or alpine pennycress Thlaspi caerulescens.

Rossini's last opera in the Italian language (all of his later works were in French) premiered under the title Le voyage à Reims, ou l'Hôtel du Lys-d'Or. It was commissioned to celebrate the coronation of French King Charles X in Reims in 1825 and has been acclaimed as one of Rossini's finest compositions. A demanding work, it requires 14 soloists (three sopranos, one contralto, two tenors, four baritones, and four basses). At its premiere, it was sung by the greatest voices of the day. Since the opera was written for a specific occasion, with a plot about European aristocrats, officers – and one poetess – en route to join in the French coronation festivities that the opera itself was composed for, Rossini never intended it to have a life beyond a few performances in Paris. He later re-used about half of the music in Le comte Ory. Il viaggio a Reims does not have an overture. Roberto Maietta, Per un catalogo del “Fondo Giuseppe Piccioli”: inquadramento delle opere e catalogo delle edizioni, Thesis for the triennial degree in musicology, University of Cremona, Faculty of Musicology, academic year 2009–2010: Catalogo delle opere edite del “Fondo Giuseppe Piccioli”, p. 22, note 5 (published in the online Library of the Faculty of Musicology of the University of Pavia). Maietta's declared source is the preface (Prefazione) to the critical edition of the opera, edited by Janet J. Johnson: Il viaggio a Reims, ossia, L'albergo del Giglio d'oro, dramma giocoso in un atto di Luigi Balocchi, musica di Gioachino Rossini, Pesaro, Fondazione Rossini, 1999, I, p. xxxv Its so-called overture, derived from a set of dances in Le siège de Corinthe (1826), one of which Rossini had reworked from the dances in the finale to Il viaggio a Reims, is a twentieth-century invention or an erroneous attribution. It was published in Milan, in 1938, in a revision by Giuseppe Piccioli,Il viaggio a Reims. Sinfonia / Gioacchino Rossini, revisione di Giuseppe Piccioli – Partitura – Milan : Carisch, 1938 which was first performed in the Teatro alla Scala, on 5 November 1938, conducted by Richard Strauss. It was later also recorded repeatedly as the alleged overture of Il viaggio a Reims, until it was finally possible to reconstruct the original score of the opera. The attributed overture remains one of Rossini's most recorded works, infusing a grand and elegant style with heavy orchestral power. ==Performance history== Il viaggio a Reims was first performed at the Théâtre Italien, Paris, on 19 June 1825, with Giuditta Pasta as Corinna. There were only four original performances. The different parts of the manuscript, assumed lost, were re-found and re-assembled in the 1970s by the musicologist Janet Johnson, with the help of Philip Gossett. The first performance after the reconstruction was given at the Rossini Opera Festival on 18 August 1984. It was conducted by Claudio Abbado and directed by Luca Ronconi. The cast included Francisco Araiza (Conte di Libenskof), Lella Cuberli (Contessa di Folleville), Enzo Dara (Barone di Trombonok), Cecilia Gasdia (Corinna), Eduardo Gimenez (Cavalier Belfiore), William Matteuzzi (Zefirino), Leo Nucci (Don Alvaro), Ruggero Raimondi (Don Profondo), Samuel Ramey (Lord Sidney), Katia Ricciarelli (Madama Cortese), and Lucia Valentini Terrani (Marchesa Melibea). Other performances have followed. The American premiere was given on 14 June 1986 by Opera Theatre of Saint Louis at the Loretto-Hilton Theater in St. Louis, directed by Colin Graham and conducted by Richard Buckley. In 1992, The Royal Opera, London, gave several performances: Carlo Rizzi conducted, and the cast included Montserrat Caballé, Renée Fleming, Sylvia McNair, John Aler and Andrew Shore. In Helsinki, on 9 January 2003, the opera was directed by Dario Fo and conducted by Pietro Rizzo. The Polish premiere was given in April 2003, directed by Tomasz Konina, with, among others, Ewa Podleś as Marchesa Melibea and Rockwell Blake as Count Libenskoff (Alberto Zedda conducted). In November 2005 there was another production in Monte Carlo, with a cast including June Anderson, Raùl Gimenez, Rockwell Blake, and Ruggero Raimondi. The Wiener Staatsoper produced the opera in its Rossini Festival conducted by Claudio Abbado, with Montserrat Caballé and again Ruggero Raimondi. The Kirov Opera performed it at the Kennedy Center in Washington, DC, in January 2007. The work was produced in Tel Aviv by the Israeli Opera in November 2007. The African premiere was presented by the University of Cape Town in collaboration with Cape Town Opera in 2010. The South American premiere was presented by the Teatro Argentino de La Plata, Argentina, in 2011. During the 2011/12 season, productions were given by the Vlaamse Opera in Antwerp in December, where the action took place inside a jumbo jet,John McCann, Opera, London, April 2012, pp. 430–431 and at the Teatro Comunale, Florence, in January where the action was staged in an early 20th-century luxury spa.Matteo Sansone, Opera, London, April 2012, p. 442 Damiano Michieletto directed the opera, set in an art gallery, for the Dutch National Opera in 2015 and for the Royal Danish Opera in 2017.

(\\"Presto, presto ... su, corraggio\\") The servants repudiate her assertions. The hotel's doctor, Don Prudenzio, announces that, because of the impending arrivals, the normal business of the spa will be suspended. The spa attendants rejoice and depart. He checks with Antonio that his instructions about the necessary meals for the visitors have been followed. Madame Cortese, the proprietress of the hotel, appears. She regrets that she will be unable to attend the coronation (\\"Di vaghi raggi adorno\\"), but is keen to show off the hotel to the visitors in the hope that they will return some day to take the waters. She particularly requests that everyone should be enthusiastic about each of the travellers' specific interests. Everyone agrees, and she is left alone. Scene 2: The Countess of Folleville's arrival The Countess calls for her maid, Modestina, and Madame Cortese goes to search for her. Modestina appears, and the Countess, worried that her clothes have not yet arrived, asks why there has been no reply to a letter that she had sent. Modestina had entrusted the letter to the Countess's cousin, Don Luigino, who immediately arrives to say that the stagecoach which he had hired to carry the boxes had overturned on the way. The Countess faints and Don Luigino calls for help. Maddalena, Antonio, Don Prudenzio and the servants arrive, together with Baron Trombonok. Don Prudenzio and the Baron argue about how to resuscitate the Countess, but she recovers sufficiently to lament the loss of her garments. (\\"Partir, o ciel! desio\\") However, when Modestina appears with a large box containing a beautiful Paris bonnet, she rejoices that it, at least, has been saved from the accident. (\\"Che miro! Ah! Quel sorpresa!\\") Everyone is amused by this sudden turn of events, and all except Antonio and the Baron depart. Scene 3: Sextet After agreeing with the Baron the arrangements for the party's departure in the evening, Antonio leaves. The Baron cannot help laughing at the Countess's sudden recovery and the insanity of the world in general. He is joined by Don Profondo, Don Alvaro, the Marquise Melibea, Count Libenskof. It is clear that Don Alvaro and the Count are rivals for the Marquise's affections. They are all waiting for the new horses which will be necessary for the continuation of the journey, but Madame Cortese, who now arrives, says that she cannot understand why they have not arrived. Alvaro and Libenskof quarrel, the ladies are alarmed, and the Baron and Don Profondo are amused by the idiocy of lovers. (\\"Non pavento alcun periglio\\") A harp prelude is heard, and the poetess Corinna sings offstage of brotherly love, to everyone's delight. (\\"Arpa gentil\\") Act 2 Scene 1: Lord Sidney's aria Madame Cortese is still waiting for the return of her servant Gelsomino with news of the horses. Lord Sidney approaches, and she muses on his unwillingness to approach Corinna who, she is sure, reciprocates his love. Sidney, alone, laments his situation. (\\"Invan strappar dal core\\") His mood lifts when girls singing in praise of Corinna enter with flowers, but then he is disturbed by Don Profondo's strange requests for information about the location of antiquities, and departs. Scene 2: Corinna's duet with the Chevalier Belfiore Profondo is joined by Corinna and her companion Delia. Corinna asks when the party is to depart, and he and Delia leave Corinna alone while they go to see whether the horses have arrived. Corinna is joined by the Chevalier, who declares his love. (\\"Nel suo divin sembiante\\") She is taken aback and repudiates him. The Chevalier retreats, hoping to try again later, and Corinna returns to her room. Scene 3: Don Profondo's aria Don Profondo, who has seen the Chevalier with Corinna, reflects that the Countess will scratch the Chevalier's eyes out if she finds out what he has been doing. He then turns his attention to enumerating the effects of his fellow-travellers (as requested by the Baron), noting that their possessions tend to sum up their each of their nations' characteristics. (\\"Medaglie incomparabili\\") He looks forward to the impending departure. The Countess appears, looking for the Chevalier. She is not pleased when Don Profondo tells her that he has been having a poetry lesson. Don Alvaro and Count Libenskof join them, asking about the horses, and the Baron, too, appears, looking woebegone. What has happened? The rest of the travellers arrive, and the Baron produces the courier Zefirino, who is obliged to report that there are no horses to be had anywhere, not even for ready money. There will be no journey to Reims for the coronation! Scene 4: Grand concerted ensemble for 14 voices Everyone is horrified. (\\"Ah! A tal colpo inaspettato\\") But Madame Cortese appears with a letter from Paris. Don Profondo reads it out: the King will return from Reims in a few days and there will be great festivities. Anyone who was unable to get to Reims will be consoled by an even finer spectacle. The Countess steps forward to invite the entire company to her home in Paris for the celebrations. A stagecoach will convey them there on the following day, but in the meantime a grand banquet, with invitations to the public, will be held at the Golden Lily, paid for with the money that would have been spent at the coronation. Any money left over will be given to the poor. Act 3 Scene 1: Duet for the Count and the Marquise When everyone else has left, the Baron tries to reconcile the jealous Count with the Marquise, who has been seen with Don Alvaro. When he departs, the misunderstanding is resolved and harmony is restored. (\\"D'alma celeste, oh Dio!\\") They depart, and the scene changes to the hotel's garden. Antonio and Maddalena ensure that all is prepared for the banquet. The Baron has engaged a travelling company to provide entertainment with singing and dancing. Scene 2: Finale After the opening chorus (\\"L'allegria è un sommo bene\\"), the Baron introduces a series of short national songs sung by each of the travellers, some of them set to well-known tunes, and ending with, first, a French anthem (the Marche Henri IV) for the Duchesse de Berry,Marie-Caroline de Bourbon-Sicile, duchesse de Berry, was discovered to be pregnant in 1820 after the assassination of her husband, Charles Ferdinand, Duke of Berry, the third son of the future king Charles X and the heir presumptive to the throne of France: the new-born child, Henri, Count of Chambord, styled by the libretto \\"nuovo Enrico\\", was dubbed the \\"miracle child\\", as his birth possibly continued the direct Bourbon line of Kings. then a rustic Tyrolean duet for Madame Cortese and Don Profondo, and finally an improvised solo for Corinna on one of a number of mostly French subjects suggested by each traveller and drawn from an urn. The winning subject turns out, appropriately enough, to be \\"Charles X, King of France\\". The opera ends with dances and a chorus. ==Recordings== {  !Year !Cast: Corinna, Marchesa Melibea, , Cavalier Belfiore, Conte di Libenskof, Lord Sidney, Don Profondo, Baron di Trombonok, Don Alvaro !Conductor, opera house and orchestra !LabelRecordings on operadis-opera- discography.org.uk - 1984 Cecilia Gasdia, Lucia Valentini Terrani, Lella Cuberli, Katia Ricciarelli, Eduardo Giménez, Francisco Araiza, Samuel Ramey, Ruggero Raimondi, Enzo Dara, Leo Nucci Claudio Abbado, Chamber Orchestra of Europe and Prague Philharmonic Chorus, Recorded at the Rossini Festival, Pesaro Audio CD: DGG,Br>Cat: 415 498-4 - 1992 Sylvia McNair, Lucia Valentini-Terrani, Luciana Serra, Cheryl Studer, Raúl Giménez, William Matteuzzi, Samuel Ramey, Ruggero Raimondi, Enzo Dara, Lucio Gallo Claudio Abbado, Berlin Philharmonic and Rundfunkchor Berlin Audio CD: Sony Classical, Cat: S2K 53 336 - 2003 Elena de la Merced, Paula Rasmussen, Mariola Cantarero, María Bayo, José Bros, Kenneth Tarver, Simón Orfila, Nicola Ulivieri, Enzo Dara, Àngel Òdena Jesús López-Cobos, Orchestra and Chorus of Gran Teatre del Liceu, Barcelona DVD: TDK, Cat: DVUSOPVAR - 2005 Irma Guigolachvili, Anna Kiknadze, Larissa Youdina, Anastasia Belyaeva, Dmitri Voropaev, Daniil Shtoda, Edouard Tsanga, Nikolaï Kamenski, Vladislav Ouspenski, Alexeï Safiouline Valery Gergiev, Orchestra and Chorus of the Mariinsky Theatre, Saint Petersburg, with singers from the Academy of Young Singers of the Mariinsky Theatre.

John Saris (c. 1580 – 1643) was chief merchant on the first English voyage to Japan, which left London in 1611. He stopped at Yemen, missing India (which he had originally intended to visit) and going on to Java, which had the sole permanent English trading station (or 'factory') in Asia. Saris had spent more than five years there before, as a merchant, having gone with the East India Company Second Voyage, under Henry Middleton. He became Chief Factor there, but returned to London in 1610. Now arrived again, in 1612, Saris decided to send his other ships home, taking just one, the Clove, on to Japan, where it arrived in summer 1613. ==Career== Although the better known William Adams was the first Englishman to arrive in Japan in April 1600, he did so as the navigator of the Dutch ship Liefde (Charity), rather than aboard an English ship. Saris received much aid from Adams, who had become the shogun's advisor on foreign affairs. As a result, Saris was able to meet the retired shogun, Tokugawa Ieyasu, who still held power, and also his son, the de facto Shōgun Tokugawa Hidetada. Ieyasu promised Saris extensive trade benefits for the English, and suggested, along with Adams, the port of Uraga as a strategic point of access to Edo Bay. But Saris decided to place the English factory far from the Shogun's capital of Edo (modern Tokyo), on Hirado, a small island off Kyūshū, Japan's largest southern island. The Dutch were already trading with some success, and it saved an extra leg of sailing along dangerous coasts. Saris was partly welcomed in Japan because of the astonishing present he had brought. This was a telescope, described as 'silver-gilt' and very large. It was the first telescope ever to leave Europe, and the first to be made as a royal-level gift. Sadly, it is not extant. After some months, at the end of 1613, Saris sailed home to England, leaving Richard Cocks in charge of the Hirado operation. It failed, due in large part to the fact that the English came to Japan to sell their finest domestic product, which was woollen cloth, but it tended to rot en route. English efforts to develop a trade relationship with China at this time failed as well, and so the Hirado factory was abandoned 'temporarily' ten years later, in 1623. Saris brought back Ieyasu's reciprocal gifts for King James, in thanks for the telescope, which were stunning paintings, and from the shogun himself, two suits of armour (which are extant). He encountered some opprobrium when he was accused of 'private trade' (smuggling) and was also discovered to have shown around London some erotic Japanese 'books and pictures' (shunga). However, he was exonerated by the East India Company of the first charge, while prudently surrendering his erotica for destruction.Historic Japanese erotica reveals Tokyo’s sex secrets By Duncan Bartlett BBC World Service 1 October 2013 Saris had become very rich from this voyage. He married Anne, daughter of the wealthy London merchant William Megges, but she died in 1622, probably in childbirth. Saris then moved into a fine mansion near the Thames at Fulham, called Goodriches. He never remarried. Saris died in 1643, and is buried at All Saints' Church, Fulham, London, where his grave slab can still be seen. His unusual surname is a variant spelling of the more common Sayers. Saris's journals were published in 1900, as The Voyage of Captain John Saris to Japan, 1613, edited by Ernest M.

The first schools were largely concentrated in the sedentary communities of the Sénégal River Valley. In 1950, the first teacher training school was established at Boutilimit, and in 1957, the secondary school in Rosso also began training teachers. In part because public schools were concentrated in the south, black Africans enrolled in large numbers. As a result, the overwhelming majority of public school teachers were black, and the nation's secular educated class was dominated by black people.Berry, Laverne. \\"Modern Education\\". In Mauritania: A Country Study (Robert E. Handloff, editor). Library of Congress Federal Research Division (June 1988). This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the public domain. French Influence The few French schools located in nomadic areas had difficulty attracting students. The Maures in particular were reluctant to accept the public schools and continued to favor purely Islamic instruction. Gradually, however, they began to send their children to public schools, as they saw that traditional religious training was not preparing their children for life in the twentieth century. The French also experimented with \\"mobile schools\\" after World War II, and in this way they provided public education for a larger number of nomads. In 1954 there were twelve so-called \\"tent\\" schools serving 241 students. At least some of these tent schools continued to function after Mauritania gained independence from France in 1960. After Independence The independent government viewed secular education as one of the major methods to promote national unity, as well as a necessary step toward the development of a modern economy. It still faced shortages of funds, adequately trained teaching staff, and classroom facilities at all levels. Another teacher training school was opened in Nouakchott in 1964. School attendance was not compulsory, and in 1964-65 only 19,100 primary-school students and 1,500 secondary-school students (about 14 percent of school-age children) were enrolled. By 1985 an estimated 35 percent of primary-school-age children were enrolled in school, but only about 4 to 10 percent of eligible secondary-school-age children were enrolled. In both cases, boys heavily outnumbered girls. In 1985-86, primary-school enrollments had climbed to 140,871, and enrollments in secondary and vocational schools amounted to 34,674. The government reported a total of 878 primary schools and 44 secondary or vocational institutions. A total of 4,336 students were enrolled in postsecondary training programs. An additional 448 students were attending the National Islamic Institute (formerly the Institute of Islamic Studies), and some 1,900 Mauritanians were enrolled in various training programs abroad. The public schools employed almost 2,900 primary teachers, 1,563 secondary and vocational teachers (412 of them foreign), and 237 postsecondary instructors, more than half of them expatriates. In 1982, the National College of Administration and the National College of Sciences opened in Nouakchott, and in 1983 nearly 1,000 students began instruction at the University of Nouakchott. Difficulties Illiteracy remained a major problem and an important impediment to economic and social development. In 1985, the adult literacy rate was estimated at 17 to 25 percent, approximately half the average for sub-Saharan Africa. Nonetheless, this rate represented an improvement over the estimated 5 percent literacy rate at independence and 10 percent a decade later. Recognizing the need for a better educated work force, in 1986, the government launched a major literacy campaign and created the State Secretariat of Culture, Information, and Telecommunications to head the effort. That same year, the government reported that the number of literacy classes had already increased more than ten times over the 1985 number. At the same time, the cost of education was quite high in comparison with neighboring countries. In the mid-1980s, Mauritania was spending about US$45 million (20 percent of current expenditures) on education every year. Its costs for primary schooling were the highest per student in francophone West Africa, and only Côte d'Ivoire exceeded the cost per secondary pupil. These high costs were due in part to teachers' salaries, particularly those of expatriates, and to a generous system of scholarships. Planned investment in education for the years 1985 through 1988 was set at US$27 million under the Economic Recovery Program for 1985-88, an increase of less than 1 percent over the period from 1980 through 1984. Gradual Reforms The French system of primary and secondary schools remained in force into the late 1980s. Over the years, however, some significant changes had been made, and others were planned. In the early 1980s, instruction in the Pulaar, Azayr (Soninke), and Wolof languages was introduced into the primary school curriculum, and Literary Arabic was emphasized at all levels. The official policy of gradually replacing French with local languages and Literary Arabic, adopted in the late 1970s, drew vigorous protests from French-speaking black Mauritanians and was abandoned within a decade. Mauritania remained critically short of skilled labor. In the mid-1980s, only about 15 percent of secondary-school students were enrolled in vocational education. To redress this situation and to raise the general level of literacy, the government encouraged the growth of private and Quranic schools; most industrial training took place in private institutions. More important, the government also turned to the international community. In 1987 the World Bank agreed to help make Mauritania's education system more responsive to the country's development needs. Proposed changes involved expanding primary education and restructuring secondary schooling. Special attention was to be given to vocational training in areas of particular national need, such as water engineering and fisheries. ==Current status== Education is compulsory between the ages of 6 and 14. In 2002, the gross primary enrollment rate was 88 percent, and the net primary enrollment rate was 68 percent. Gross and net enrollment ratios are based on the number of students formally registered in primary school and therefore do not necessarily reflect actual school attendance. In 1996, 41.8 percent of children ages 7 to 14 years were attending school. As of 2001, 61 percent of children who started primary school were likely to reach grade 5. However, a lack of adequate school facilities and teachers, particularly in rural areas, is likely to impede the full realization of the government’s goal of universal primary education in Mauritania until at least 2007.\\"Mauritania\\". 2005 Findings on the Worst Forms of Child Labor . Bureau of International Labor Affairs, U.S. Department of Labor (2006). This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the public domain. Public school is free, but other costs such as books and lunches make education unaffordable for many poor children. Ongoing challenges to the provision of quality education in Mauritania include high dropout and repetition rates, inadequate curriculum, and a poor national infrastructure that prevents children from traveling to and from school. In 2002, a World Food Program (WFP) survey of out-of-school children in Mauritania found that 25 percent did not attend school due to the need to support their families or perform domestic work, and another 22 percent did not attend due to the distance to school. ==ReferencesExternal links== *International Network for Higher Education in Africa::Mauritania country profile Mauritania ","title":"Education in Mauritania"},{"id":"5557313","text":"{ class=\\"toccolours\\" style=\\"float: right; margin-left: 1em; width: 25em; font-size: 90%;\\" cellspacing=\\"3\\" - colspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"font-weight: bold; text-align: center; font-size: larger;\\" United Christian College (Kowloon East) - colspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"padding: 1em 0; text-align:center;\\" 100pxExterior view - style=\\"vertical-align:top;\\" style=\\"font-weight:bold\\"Motto Understanding Truth ‧ - style=\\"vertical-align:top;\\"  Pursuing God ‧ - style=\\"vertical- align:top;\\"  Developing Diligence ‧ - style=\\"vertical-align:top;\\"  Cultivating Virtue - style=\\"vertical-align:top;\\" style=\\"font- weight:bold\\"Established 2003 - style=\\"vertical-align:top;\\" style=\\"font- weight:bold\\"Principal Dr. CHENG Kin-tak, Samuel - style=\\"vertical- align:top;\\" style=\\"font-weight:bold\\"Address 2 Lee On Lane, Kwun Tong, Kowloon - style=\\"vertical-align:top;\\"  Hong Kong - style=\\"vertical- align:top;\\" style=\\"font-weight:bold\\"Medium of instruction English - style=\\"vertical-align:top;\\" style=\\"font-weight:bold\\"Homepage https://www.uccke.edu.hk/ } United Christian College (Kowloon East) is a private Christian middle school established in 2003.

After leaving Iran in 1981, he resided in France and Iraq. He disappeared in the 2003 invasion of Iraq and it is not known whether he is still alive. == Biography == Iraqi President Saddam Hussein welcomes Massoud Rajavi in Baghdad Rajavi joined the MEK when he was 20 and a law student at the University of Tehran. He graduated with a degree in political law. Rajavi and the MEK actively opposed the Shah of Iran and participated in the 1979 Iranian Revolution. During the Pahlavi dynasty, Rajavi was arrested by SAVAK and sentenced to death. Due to efforts by his brother, Kazem Rajavi, and various Swiss lawyers and professors, his sentence was reduced to life imprisonment. He was released from prison during the Iranian Revolution in 1979.See Abrahamian, supranote 291 Upon his release, Rajavi assumed leadership of the People's Mujahedin of Iran.See Abrahamian, supranote 363 at 146¬147, 183. When Iran's first presidential election took place in 1980, Rajavi nominated himself and his own People's Mujahedin of Iran. He was endorsed by the People's Fedai, the National Democratic Front, the Democratic Party of Kurdistan, Komala and the League of Iranian Socialists. He was disqualified in the elections by Ayatollah Khomeini on the grounds that 'those who did not endorse the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Iran could not be trusted to abide by that constitution'. In 1981, when Ayatollah Khomeini dismissed President Bani Sadr and a new wave of arrests and executions started in the country, Rajavi and Bani Sadr fled to Paris from Tehran's airbase. Massoud Rajavi and Bani Sadr formed the National Council of Resistance of Iran (NCRI) “with the intent to replace the Khomeini regime with the ‘Democratic Islamic Republic.’” As a form of agreement with the Islamic republic, in 1986 France's Prime Minister Jacques Chirac evicted the MEK out of France. Rajavi and approximately five to ten thousand MEK members were received by the Iraqi government. Rajavi moved to Iraq and set up a base on the Iranian border. == Electoral history == {  center;\\" - ! Year !! Election !! Votes !! % !! Rank !!

The MEK have denied the charges, saying that they constitute a \\"politically motivated decision and it’s the last gift presented from the government of Nuri al-Maliki to the Iranian government\\". Back in 2005, a Patriotic Union of Kurdistan official asked for arrest and trial of Rajavi based on his organization's documentary evidence of the involvement. == Disappearance == Shortly after the Iraq War, Massoud Rajavi disappeared. His whereabouts remain unknown. In his absence, Maryam Rajavi has assumed his responsibilities as leader of the MEK. In 2011 the NCRI posted an article which described Rajavi as being \\"in hiding\\",Matt Cresswell, Camp Ashraf protest moves to Paris, 24 June 2011, source unclear; article posted on NCRI website, 2 July 2011 but that has not been independently verified. The MEK have issued statements to claim that Massoud Rajavi is still alive. == Personal life == Rajavi came from a prominent family. He received a degree in political law from Tehran University. His brother was Kazem Rajavi, Iran's ambassador to the United Nations in Geneva who held doctoral degrees from Universities in Paris and Geneva. They had three other brothers, Saleh (a cardiologist in France), Ahamad (a British-educated surgeon), and Hooshang (an engineer in Belgium). Rajavi married fellow MEK member Ashraf Rabiei in summer 1980. Rabiei was regarded as \\"the symbol of revolutionary womanhood\\", and was assassinated by the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps.Who Is Responsible for the MKO Massacre at Camp Ashraf? His second wife was Abolhassan Banisadr's daughter, Firouzeh. Their marriage took place in October 1982 and the couple divorced in 1984, after Banisadr left the NCRI. Rajavi married Maryam Qajar Azodanlu (later known as Maryam Rajavi) in 1985. Rajavi has a son from his first wife, named Mostafa. == References  External links == * Category:Iranian activists Category:Missing people Category:Possibly living people Category:1948 births Category:People's Mujahedin of Iran members Category:People's Mujahedin of Iran politicians Category:People of the 1991 uprisings in Iraq Category:People of the Iranian Revolution Category:Iranian revolutionaries Category:Exiles of the Iranian Revolution in France Category:Iranian emigrants to France Category:Iranian emigrants to Iraq Category:Fugitives wanted on crimes against humanity charges ","title":"Massoud Rajavi"},{"id":"5557406","text":"Acromicric dysplasia is an extremely rare inherited disorder characterized by abnormally short hands and feet, growth retardation and delayed bone maturation leading to short stature.

It was notable for the first performance of Grateful Dead in the UK and also for the performance of Mungo Jerry, and featured such notable bands as Free, Ginger Baker's Air Force, Colosseum, Family, Black Sabbath and Traffic. The company responsible for the festival was Onista Ltd, who promptly went bankrupt unable to pay festival staff. Onista was an offshoot of Eliot Cohen's Red Bus company, with Ellis Elias and Elliot Cohen as the promoters. ==History== This was the first of the major festivals held in the summer of 1970 and part of the festival was to have been filmed by the BBC. Andrew Burgoyne of Burgoyne Film and Audio Services also filmed and recorded audio of some of the festival. Film crews can be seen on 8 mm footage of bands taken by fans at the festival on several occasions, notably during Quintessence and the Dead's performances. A DVD and CD set was issued in 2010, featuring archive material from the Grateful Dead's set, and one number each from Free, Family, Screaming Lord Sutch, and Radha Krishna Temple along with a biographical booklet of the event. Rumours circulated in the music papers about the supergroup that Lord Sutch was supposed to be fronting, Eric Clapton, John Lennon, and others were supposed to join in a super jam, but none of these luminaries showed up, nor did scheduled acts such as the James Gang and The Flying Burrito Brothers which tended to dilute the overseas offerings. Former Tyrannosaurus Rex percussionist Steve Peregrin Took was billed to debut his new band Shagrat (featuring Larry Wallis on guitar) at the festival but this also fell through. Shagrat would eventually play their first - and only - gig at the Phun City festival that July.

Its aim is to support and promote Nordic and Faroese culture, locally and in the Nordic region ==History== Erlendur Patursson (1913–1986), Faroese member of the Nordic Council, brought forward the idea of a Nordic cultural house in the Faroe Islands. A Nordic competition for architects was held in 1977, where 158 architects participated. Winners were Ola Steen from Norway and Kollbrún Ragnarsdóttir from Iceland. By staying true to folklore the architects built the Nordic House to resemble an enchanting hill of elves. The building is considered to be one of the most beautiful in Scandinavia. The house opened in Tórshavn in 1983. The Nordic House is organized as a cultural organization under the Nordic Council of Ministers. The Nordic House is run by a steering committee of eight, of which three are Faroese and five from the outside Nordic countries. Also, there is a local advisory body of 15 members, representing the Faroese cultural organizations. For a four-year period, the steering committee appoints a director of the house. ==Architecture== Nordic House ”The combination of a national culture center and a center to impact culture between the Faroe Islands and other Nordic countries” was the brief for Ola Steen who designed the Nordic House. In concept, it is green with dragon-like steel struts to provide stability against the strain that the hurricane winds often place on the 2000 m² turf-covered roof. Inside the building, there is a large lobby space that can house a number of simultaneous activities. There is a café and a recessed amphitheater. Exhibitions are organized here as well as cultural events. The public areas can be subdivided or combined with light, sound and space-defining elements. All of the rooms are daylit except for the 800 m² hall, which can be opened to the amphitheater and lobby, as the west end wall consists of movable elements. The bearing element in structure and space is the high in-cast concrete wall in the large hall. Everything rests on it or relates to it. The large span of steel structure emanating from this wall gives space in the lobby for the organic, snakelike, and supple stairs and ramp. ==Materials== The materials used at the Nordic House come from all over Scandinavia. In the lobby and on the ramps is Norwegian slate from Gudbrandsdal. The wood flooring is Swedish pine. Ceilings in the hall and amphitheater are of Danish ash, and all doors and veneered furnishings are of Finnish birch, with Danish brass fittings. All the exterior materials originated from the Faroe Islands or were produced on the Islands except for the glass and anodized aluminum facades, which are Danish. ==Some significant annual events== * North Atlantic Music Event (exclusive Faroese bi-yearly showcase) * Prix Føroyar 1995-2005 (a bi-annual music competition) * The New Year Concert (with the Faroese Symphony Orchestra) * The Sommerexhibition (features Faroese artists) ==ReferencesBibliography== * Red.

The first, and only described species, N. hermanastes, was first described in 2000 from the Nama Group of central and southern Namibia. A U–Pb zircon age from the fossiliferous rock in Namibia and Oman provides an age for the Namacalathus zone in the range from 549 to 542 Ma, which corresponds to the Late Ediacaran. Alongside Namapoikia and Cloudina, these organisms are the oldest known evidence in the fossil record of the emergence of calcified skeletal formation in metazoans, a prominent feature in animals appearing later in the Early Cambrian. There are only five occurrences of Namacalathus (Namibia, Canada, Oman, Siberia, Paraguay) known to date, all of which are found in association with Cloudina fossils. Among the late Precambrian fossil assemblage in the Nama group, Namibia, Namacalathus far outnumber Cloudina and other poorly preserved taxa and ichnofossils found in the formation. The Nama Group fossils occur within thrombolitic facies of immense Proterozoic stromatolitic reefs. Namacalathus lived a benthic existence with its stalk attached to the sea floor by means of a holdfast, or possibly to algal mats growing on the reef surface. == Morphology == The skeleton is believed to have consisted of high-magnesium calcite. It has a unique shape with a cup on a stalk. The stalk is hollow all the way through and tapered from the bottom, ranging from 1 to 2 mm in diameter, and reaching 30 mm in length. The narrower top of the stalk connects to the cup. The cup is hollow and has a large hole in the top with the shell curving over forming a cup lip. Around the side of the globe are six or seven symmetrically arranged holes, called \\"windows\\". The wall curves inwards around each window in a formation called window lips. Each hole is slightly elongated vertically and expanded on the higher side. The size of the cup varies from two to about 25 mm, but averages 6.1 mm. The ratio of the height of the cup to the diameter is from 0.7 to 1.3. The fossil is lightly calcified, preserved as calcite crystals; its original morphology is unknown. The walls in Namacalathus are only 0.1 mm thick, and often deformed by the weight of the sediment. The windows were probably originally filled with organic matter during life, but the cup was likely to be open. Siberian specimens from the borehole Vostok 3 were designated as new species, because they have, unlike the type species N. hermanastes, a significantly smaller size. Most specimens show sections of the perforated cup, ranging from 110 to 230 μm in diameter; one specimen (with a cup 120 μm across) has a stalk (30 μm in diameter). The walls of the cup are 10 μm thick. Because the three- dimensional shape of Namacalathus is complex, and the wall is so thin, the fossils appear as a two-dimensional sections in a wide variety of shapes, including closed and open circles, irregular hexagons or heptagons, as well as heart and moon shapes. == Ecology == Namacalathus was an ecological generalist, able to colonise a variety of settings in the mid- to off-ramp environs, adapting its size to suit the local conditions. == Affinity == Namacalathus has typically been considered to represent a cnidarian-grade organism, due in part to its propensity for asexual reproduction by budding. Most recently, however (2015), it been interpreted as a lophophorate based on detailed observations of its skeletal construction, which point to accretionary growth in the manner of brachiopods and bryozoans. == See also == * List of Ediacaran genera == Notes  References == Category:Ediacaran biota Category:Prehistoric incertae sedis animal genera Category:Fossils of Namibia Category:Precambrian Africa Category:Precambrian fossils Category:Fossil taxa described in 2000 ","title":"Namacalathus"},{"id":"5557528","text":"The Clement C.

These cockroaches live in sandy soils and dunes in the southwestern United States, Florida and Mexico. Arenivaga comes from the Latin arena meaning sand and vagus meaning wandering.A Latin-English Dictionary Wordlist ==Characteristics== This genus is sexually dimorphic, with males and females differing in morphology. The insects are dorso-ventrally flattened and males have wings that are generally longer than the abdomen. The colour cannot be relied on to distinguish between species because the insects sequester pigments from their food and therefore their colour depends on their diet; they accumulate uric acid in varying amounts, and this also affects their appearance. The head has a pair of long, slender antennae, two large compound eyes and two protuberant ocelli. The labrum is broad, and the frons and the hinder part of the clypeus are fused and form a bulge in a manner unusual for cockroaches. The pronotum is large and covers the head and extends sideways to about the width of the body. There are setae on the dorsal surface of the pronotum and different species have different patterning, which may be impressed into the surface. The patterning may be surrounded by an aura which radiates out from the pattern, and at the side of the pronotum, uric acid may be stored in white or pale pink patches. The smallest species is A. pumila at a length of , and the largest A. bolliana at . Some species are broader and more robust than others. The legs bear many spines, including spines around the joint between the meso and meta-tibia, and the tarsi have two claws, except in A. darwini where there is only one. The main means of distinguishing between the different species is close examination of the male genitalia. ==Ecology== Females and nymphs live underground, \\"swimming\\" through the sandy substrate, and residing in the burrows of small mammals with which they cohabit. They feed on mycorrhizal fungi, plant detritus, and the seeds gathered by the mammals. Males have brief lives and live mostly on the surface. The breeding habits of sand cockroaches have been little studied but it seems that females emerge onto the surface at night, attract the winged males, perhaps by the use of pheromones, mate and rebury themselves in the sand. The desert cockroach (A. investigata) has been shown to be able to absorb water from the atmosphere. ==References== Category:Cockroach genera ","title":"Arenivaga"},{"id":"5557579","text":"Carbonyl fluoride is a chemical compound with the formula COF2.

The building, which has a gross surface area of 227,278 m2, still provides for additional meeting rooms, office space and press facilities for both institutions. It consists of 17 conference rooms with at least 10 interpretation booths each, 5 other meeting rooms and 2 rooms for official meals. It also provides 40,048 m2 of offices for both institutions' shared General Secretariat. An onsite press centre is also featured, which can be extended during summits with up to 600 seats in the atrium. It is linked, via means of two skyways and a service tunnel, to the Europa building. ==Location== The building is located in the European quarter at 175 Wetstraat/Rue de la Loi next to the Schuman roundabout and opposite the Berlaymont building, the headquarters of the European Commission. To the west is the Europa building. To the south the building borders Jean Rey Square and Leopold Park. The façade bordering the square is being considered for renovation to improve the building's appearance. Transport links to the building include Schuman station, which provides metro, as well as, regional, national and international rail services. The station is situated immediately to the north of the Justus Lipsius building. ==History== In 1985, in response to an initiative by Belgium, the Council of the EU appointed the Belgian Federal Government's Régie des Bâtiments as the contracting authority to construct a new building better suited to its needs. The foundation stone of the new building was laid in 1989. It is situated on land previously owned by the Belgian Government, a site formerly crossed by the street Rue Juste Lipse, named in honour of Justus Lipsius, a Flemish philologist and humanist. The new structure took the name of the demolished street, which had linked Rue de la Loi to Rue Belliard, to become the Justus Lipsius building. Blocs D and E of the former 1920s Résidence Palace were razed to make way for the construction. The official inauguration took place on 29 May 1995, under the French Presidency of the Council of the EU. During the construction period, the Council of the EU was housed in the Charlemagne building located across the street, since renovated and currently in use by the European Commission. From 2002, the European Council also utilised the Justus Lipsius building as its headquarters. This followed an advanced implementation of an agreement by European Union leaders, during ratification of the Nice Treaty, to do so at such a time as the total membership of the EU surpassed 18 Member States. Prior to this, summits of the European Council were based in the EU member state that held the rotating Presidency of the Council of the EU. A number of renovations were made to the building to accommodate the increased demands of both institutions and growing EU membership, including the conversion of the building's basement car park into additional meeting rooms. However, at the beginning of 2017 both institutions moved into a new purpose-built seat in the adjacent Europa building. The Justus Lipsius building is still utilised by both institutions and is linked via two skyways and a service tunnel to the new venue. == See also == * European council * Berlaymont building (European Commission) * Espace Léopold (Brussels seat of the European Parliament) * Europa building (Seat of the European Council and Council of the EU) * Lex building * Brussels and the European Union * Institutional seats of the European Union * Entropa ==References External links == * European Council and Council of the EU website * The Justus Lipsius Building * Belgium Guide Category:Buildings and structures in Brussels Category:Council of the European Union Category:Buildings and structures of the European Union Category:European quarter of Brussels Category:Office buildings in Belgium ","title":"Justus Lipsius building"},{"id":"5557593","text":"Diana Johnstone (born 1934) is an American political writer based in Paris, France.

The idea of a dual object generalizes the more familiar concept of the dual of a finite-dimensional vector space. So, the motivating example of a compact closed category is FdVect, the category having finite-dimensional vector spaces as objects and linear maps as morphisms, with tensor product as the monoidal structure. Another example is Rel, the category having sets as objects and relations as morphisms, with Cartesian monoidal structure. == Symmetric compact closed category == A symmetric monoidal category (\\\\mathbf{C},\\\\otimes,I) is compact closed if every object A \\\\in \\\\mathbf C has a dual object. If this holds, the dual object is unique up to canonical isomorphism, and is denoted A^*. In a bit more detail, an object A^* is called the dual of A if it is equipped with two morphisms called the unit \\\\eta_A:I\\\\to A^*\\\\otimes A and the counit \\\\varepsilon_A:A\\\\otimes A^*\\\\to I, satisfying the equations :\\\\lambda_A\\\\circ(\\\\varepsilon_A\\\\otimes A)\\\\circ\\\\alpha_{A,A^*,A}^{-1}\\\\circ(A\\\\otimes\\\\eta_A)\\\\circ\\\\rho_A^{-1}=\\\\mathrm{id}_A and :\\\\rho_{A^*}\\\\circ(A^*\\\\otimes\\\\varepsilon_A)\\\\circ\\\\alpha_{A^*,A,A^*}\\\\circ(\\\\eta_A\\\\otimes A^*)\\\\circ\\\\lambda_{A^*}^{-1}=\\\\mathrm{id}_{A^*}, where \\\\lambda,\\\\rho are the introduction of the unit on the left and right, respectively, and \\\\alpha is the associator. For clarity, we rewrite the above compositions diagrammatically. In order for (\\\\mathbf{C},\\\\otimes,I) to be compact closed, we need the following composites to equal \\\\mathrm{id}_A: : A\\\\xrightarrow{\\\\cong} A\\\\otimes I\\\\xrightarrow{A\\\\otimes\\\\eta}A\\\\otimes (A^*\\\\otimes A)\\\\xrightarrow{\\\\cong} (A\\\\otimes A^*)\\\\otimes A\\\\xrightarrow{\\\\epsilon\\\\otimes A} I\\\\otimes A\\\\xrightarrow{\\\\cong} A and \\\\mathrm{id}_{A^*}: : A^*\\\\xrightarrow{\\\\cong} I\\\\otimes A^*\\\\xrightarrow{\\\\eta\\\\otimes A^*}(A^*\\\\otimes A)\\\\otimes A^*\\\\xrightarrow{\\\\cong} A^*\\\\otimes (A\\\\otimes A^*)\\\\xrightarrow{A^* \\\\otimes\\\\epsilon} A^*\\\\otimes I\\\\xrightarrow{\\\\cong} A^* == Definition == More generally, suppose (\\\\mathbf{C},\\\\otimes,I) is a monoidal category, not necessarily symmetric, such as in the case of a pregroup grammar. The above notion of having a dual A^* for each object A is replaced by that of having both a left and a right adjoint, A^l and A^r, with a corresponding left unit \\\\eta^l_A:I\\\\to A\\\\otimes A^l, right unit \\\\eta^r_A:I\\\\to A^r\\\\otimes A, left counit \\\\varepsilon^l_A:A^l\\\\otimes A\\\\to I, and right counit \\\\varepsilon^r_A:A\\\\otimes A^r\\\\to I. These must satisfy the four yanking conditions, each of which are identities: : A\\\\to A\\\\otimes I\\\\xrightarrow{\\\\eta^r}A\\\\otimes (A^r\\\\otimes A)\\\\to (A\\\\otimes A^r)\\\\otimes A\\\\xrightarrow{\\\\epsilon^r} I\\\\otimes A\\\\to A : A\\\\to I\\\\otimes A\\\\xrightarrow{\\\\eta^l}(A\\\\otimes A^l)\\\\otimes A\\\\to A\\\\otimes (A^l \\\\otimes A)\\\\xrightarrow{\\\\epsilon^l} A\\\\otimes I\\\\to A and : A^r\\\\to I\\\\otimes A^r\\\\xrightarrow{\\\\eta^r}(A^r\\\\otimes A)\\\\otimes A^r\\\\to A^r\\\\otimes (A\\\\otimes A^r)\\\\xrightarrow{\\\\epsilon^r} A^r\\\\otimes I\\\\to A^r : A^l\\\\to A^l\\\\otimes I\\\\xrightarrow{\\\\eta^l}A^l\\\\otimes (A\\\\otimes A^l)\\\\to (A^l\\\\otimes A)\\\\otimes A^l \\\\xrightarrow{\\\\epsilon^l} I\\\\otimes A^l\\\\to A^l That is, in the general case, a compact closed category is both left and right-rigid, and biclosed. Non- symmetric compact closed categories find applications in linguistics, in the area of categorial grammars and specifically in pregroup grammars, where the distinct left and right adjoints are required to capture word-order in sentences. In this context, compact closed monoidal categories are called (Lambek) pregroups. == Properties == Compact closed categories are a special case of monoidal closed categories, which in turn are a special case of closed categories. Compact closed categories are precisely the symmetric autonomous categories. They are also *-autonomous. Every compact closed category C admits a trace. Namely, for every morphism f:A\\\\otimes C\\\\to B\\\\otimes C, one can define :\\\\mathrm{Tr_{A,B}^C}(f)=\\\\rho_B\\\\circ(id_B\\\\otimes\\\\varepsilon_C)\\\\circ\\\\alpha_{B,C,C^*}\\\\circ(f\\\\otimes C^*)\\\\circ\\\\alpha_{A,C,C^*}^{-1}\\\\circ(id_A\\\\otimes\\\\eta_{C^*})\\\\circ\\\\rho_A^{-1}:A\\\\to B which can be shown to be a proper trace. It helps to draw this diagrammatically: A\\\\xrightarrow{\\\\cong}A\\\\otimes I\\\\xrightarrow{A\\\\otimes\\\\eta_{C^*}}A\\\\otimes (C\\\\otimes C^*)\\\\xrightarrow{\\\\cong}(A\\\\otimes C)\\\\otimes C^* \\\\xrightarrow{\\\\;\\\\;f\\\\otimes C^*\\\\;\\\\;}(B\\\\otimes C)\\\\otimes C^*\\\\xrightarrow{\\\\cong}B\\\\otimes(C\\\\otimes C^*)\\\\xrightarrow{B\\\\otimes\\\\varepsilon_C}B\\\\otimes I\\\\xrightarrow{\\\\cong}B. == Examples == The canonical example is the category FdVect with finite- dimensional vector spaces as objects and linear maps as morphisms. Here A^* is the usual dual of the vector space A. The category of finite-dimensional representations of any group is also compact closed. The category Vect, with all vector spaces as objects and linear maps as morphisms, is not compact closed; it is symmetric monoidal closed. Simplex category The augmented simplex category can be used to construct an example of non-symmetric compact closed category. The augmented simplex category is the category of finite ordinals (viewed as totally ordered sets); its morphisms are order-preserving (monotone) maps. We make it into a monoidal category by moving to the arrow category, so the objects are morphisms of the original category, and the morphisms are commuting squares. Then the tensor product of the arrow category is the original composition operator. The left and right adjoints are the min and max operators; specifically, for a monotone map f one has the right adjoint :f^r(n) = \\\\sup \\\\\\\\{m \\\\in \\\\mathbb{N} \\\\mid f(m) \\\\le n\\\\\\\\} and the left adjoint :f^l(n) = \\\\inf \\\\\\\\{m \\\\in \\\\mathbb{N} \\\\mid n \\\\le f(m)\\\\\\\\} The left and right units and counits are: :\\\\mbox {id} \\\\le f \\\\circ f^l\\\\qquad\\\\mbox{(left unit)} :\\\\,\\\\mbox {id} \\\\le f^r \\\\circ f\\\\quad\\\\ \\\\ \\\\ \\\\mbox{(right unit)} :f^l \\\\circ f \\\\le \\\\mbox {id}\\\\qquad\\\\mbox{(left counit)} :f \\\\circ f^r \\\\le \\\\mbox {id}\\\\qquad\\\\mbox{(right counit)} One of the yanking conditions is then :f = f \\\\circ \\\\mbox {id} \\\\le f \\\\circ (f^r \\\\circ f) = (f \\\\circ f^r) \\\\circ f \\\\le \\\\mbox {id} \\\\circ f = f. The others follow similarly. The correspondence can be made clearer by writing the arrow \\\\to instead of \\\\le, and using \\\\otimes for function composition \\\\circ.  Dagger compact category  A dagger symmetric monoidal category which is compact closed is a dagger compact category. ==Rigid category== A monoidal category that is not symmetric, but otherwise obeys the duality axioms above, is known as a rigid category. A monoidal category where every object has a left (resp. right) dual is also sometimes called a left (resp. right) autonomous category. A monoidal category where every object has both a left and a right dual is sometimes called an autonomous category. An autonomous category that is also symmetric is then a compact closed category. == References == Category:Monoidal categories Category:Closed categories ","title":"Compact closed category"},{"id":"5557624","text":"Paraje, a Spanish term meaning in English place or spot.Spanish to English Translation - Oxford Dictionaries from es.oxforddictionaries.com accessed February 19, 2019 Paraje is a term from the original Spanish speaking settlers, in use among English speakers in the southwestern United States, particularly in New Mexico, that refers to a camping place along a long distance trail where travelers customarily stopped for the night. A paraje can be a town, a village or pueblo, a caravanserai, or simply a good location for stopping. Parajes typically are spaced 10 to 15 miles apart and feature abundant water and fodder for the travelers' animals (oxen, cattle, sheep, donkeys, mules and horses). The early Spanish caravans were largely ox-drawn carts and the oxen and herds of cattle and sheep could only make these short distances in a day without cost to the animals, because they needed to graze for several hours each day to stay in health. Horses and mules could make much longer distances in a day, up to 60 miles without cost to the animal, so long as they had water and grazing, but after a few days would have to graze and rest for a day or two to recover if grazing was not available. In the most arid desert regions of these routes it was sufficient if the paraje had water, scarce at the best of times, but lethal if not available to man or beast, particularly in the hot, dry seasons of the year. A route between two parajes, that is difficult but must be traversed in one day because there is no water along the way, was known as a jornada. The Jornada del Muerto in New Mexico, probably the oldest and most well known of these jornadas, along the El Camino Real de Tierra Adentro had parajes along its course, from south to north: * Paraje de Robledo, a paraje with grazing located along the Rio Grande, the last stop before entering the Jornada.George D. Torok, From the Pass to the Pueblos, Sunstone Press, Santa Fe, Dec 1, 2011 * Paraje de San Diego, a paraje located on a plateau overlooking the water and grazing below in the Rincon Valley on the Rio Grande. * Paraje del Perrillo, a paraje located where two small waterholes were found in the Jornada in the vicinity of Point of Rocks., * La Cruz de Alemán a paraje with only a small, unreliable spring, named for the German fugitive that died of thirst there in 1670. * Laguna del Muerto, a paraje at a desert playa, seasonally a lake, with grazing along its retreating shoreline. * Paraje de Fray Cristóbal, a paraje with grazing along the eastern bank of the Rio Grande on the northern end of the Jornada. The Jornada del Muerto is the most well known of these jornadas, but there were others. One was the jornada between Tucson and the Pima Villages on the Gila River. A second was the El Camino del Diablo, the route across the Sonoran Desert between Caborca, Sonora and the Yuma Crossing. A third was the Anza Trail between the Yuma Crossing and the coastal mountains of Southern California across the Colorado Desert. In New Mexico, one notable paraje on El Camino Real de Tierra Adentro is El Rancho de las Golondrinas in La Cienega, New Mexico, located between the Rio Grande and Santa Fe, New Mexico, is a museum of an old paraje and of life in old Nuevo México.El Rancho de las Golondrinas – The Southwest's Premier Living History Museum, Santa Fe, New Mexico from golondrinas.org Accessed February 20, 2019 == See also == * Paraje, New Mexico * Paraje, Socorro County, New Mexico == References External links== Category:New Mexico culture Category:Spanish words and phrases ","title":"Paraje"},{"id":"5557637","text":"Labrador is a coastal suburb in the City of Gold Coast, Queensland, Australia. In the , Labrador had a population of 18,261 people. == Geography == The suburb overlooks the Gold Coast Broadwater to the east and Southport on the southern border. There are many Aboriginal cultural sites across the Gold Coast. Labrador was part of traditional country for several families, due to the abundance of shell fish, mudcrabs, oysters and waterfowl in the area. The two local peoples most spoken of by the early settlers were the Yugambeh and Kombumerri Aboriginals. The Gold Coast City Council publishes the Labrador Heritage Walk, and produces a guide booklet which includes twenty one places of historical interest. Three mapped walks have been designed to note the points of interest. ==History== Real estate map, circa 1885 In April 1878 sugar farmer and investor Robert Muir and investor John Lennon bought of portion 62 of Crown Land, originally known as Southport North. Portion 62 fronted the Broadwater from Biggera Creek to Broad Street, and the future Billington Street formed part of the western boundary, which continued north until it reached Biggera Creek. The land was surveyed and divided into 19 selections not long after its purchase. When the allotments were sold they were advertised as part of ‘Mr Muir’s Central Southport Estate’. The land overlooked the expanse of the Broadwater and was a good spot for fishing. Land from Portion 62, Parish of Barrow, bound by Broad Street to the south, Loder Street to the west and Saltwater Creek to the north, was offered for sale in August 1883. Allotments 7,8 and 9 of section 4, portion 62 being site of the Labrador Hotel were offered for sale at the same time. Robert Muir is believed to have named the area in the late 19th century after the a local fishery in north-eastern Canada, owing to the similarities both held in the recreational fishing of streams and the peninsula shape of the land. Hotels The Labrador Hotel was built circa 1881 by Fredrick Shaw on land originally part of Robert Muirs' selection. The hotel had fifteen bedrooms and three sitting rooms, out houses and stables sufficient for regular use by Queensland coach service Cobb and Co. Passengers arriving by boat from Brisbane were also taken to the hotel by the Cobb and Co. In 1844 the hotel lease was taken by John Langdon who secured a Country Publican's licence with liquor licence. The hotels business declined when another Hotel opened at the northern tip of Labrador, Deepwater point, in 1886. Mr Langdon sold the Labrador Hotel to a Maria Matilda Crooke at auction in April 1888. The hotel was completely destroyed by fire later in 1888. 1885 Deepwater Point Estate map The area was often portrayed as a mosquito swamp land due to its geography and numerous creeks and steams. This did not prevent the investment and building of the Grand Hotel in 1886 at Deepwater point, overlooking the ocean. It had become a local landmark by 1922, having tennis courts and a ballroom. Extensions during the 1950s included a beer garden and an entertainment room to host International cabarets popular at the time. In 1975 the timber building was completely destroyed by fire. The site saw transformation with a much smaller brick building named The Grand Tavern which was later demolished in 1987 to make way for adjacent land acquisition and development plans. A new hotel was built in a Queenslander style with an apartment block above it. The Grand opened in 2001. Remaining land was sold and apartments were built. Homes Marine Parade apartment building, 2015 Hilltop House was originally a community meeting place before a community hall was planned and partly funded by social events and dances at the centre. It was owned by the Freeman family who named it in the 1930s after moving moved it from the Broad Street area to higher ground and converted to a house. The street was later named Hilltop. The Freeman family had been owners of Labrador House on Marine Parade between 1924 and 1938. Labrador House ca.1920 Labrador House was built in 1883 facing Marine Parade as a holiday home with views to the broadwater and South Stradbroke Island. It was one of the first large homes, built by Francis Augusta Lousia Thorn. It sat on of land. In 1923 Jim (James) Cavill owned the home and thought to re-develop it. Instead he took his development ideas to Elston, now Surfers Paradise. In 1937 the land was subdivided into thirteen blocks. The following year the house was converted into three flats. In 1945 the Hasemann family became owners of the house and eleven years later built a convenience store on one side. In 1957 the house was still in the Hasemann family. In 1970 the house was demolished for redevelopment of the site. Education Labrador State School 1959 The first Labrador State School building was built on four acres of swampy land donated by the Queensland Government on the corner of Billington Street and Brisbane Road. A local committee arranged for the land to be cleared and made suitable for the 17 original students. The school was officially opened on 24 January 1921. Within two months, 26 students were officially enrolled. Miss May Macpherson was the first and sole Teacher, responsible for teaching all grades required. By 1933 there were 44 students enrolled. Concern over the swampy land that often flooded and increasing traffic on Brisbane Road led to lobbying government for larger premises. A new site at Imperial Parade was acquired in 1948. The old school house building was moved to the Southport State School grounds. Turpin Road and Gordon Street bound the new site at Imperial Parade, where the school is still located. This school building was officially opened on 2 August 1952. There were four classrooms and 193 pupils. Population At the 2006 Census, Labrador had a population of 15,391, and grew to 16,402 at the 2011 Census. In the , Labrador had a population of 18,261 people. ==Demographics== According to the of Population, there were 18,261 people in Labrador. * Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people made up 2.1% of the population. * 57.2% of people were born in Australia. The most common countries of birth were New Zealand 8.7%, England 4.3%, China 1.4%, India 1.1% and Philippines 1.1%. * 73.3% of people spoke only English at home. Other languages spoken at home included Mandarin 1.8%, Japanese 1.1%, Bosnian 0.8%, Spanish 0.8% and Arabic 0.7%. * The most common responses for religion were No Religion 32.4% and Catholic 18.4%. ==Education== Labrador State School is a government primary (Prep-6) school for boys and girls at Turpin Road (). In 2017, the school had an enrolment of 940 students with 74 teachers (67 full-time equivalent) and 38 non-teaching staff (26 full-time equivalent). The school includes an Intensive English Centre and a special education program. There is no secondary school in Labrador; the nearest public secondary school is Southport State High School. ==See also== * James Cavill involvement in the development of Surfers Paradise and Cavill Avenue * Labrador Australian Football Club ==ReferencesExternal links== * * Category:Suburbs of the Gold Coast, Queensland Category:Fishing communities in Australia Category:Coastline of Queensland ","title":"Labrador, Queensland"},{"id":"5557646","text":"Parkers Prairie can refer to a community in the United States: * Parkers Prairie, Minnesota * Parkers Prairie Township, Otter Tail County, Minnesota ","title":"Parkers Prairie"},{"id":"5557654","text":"SegaWorld and Sega Park are names referring to arcades in the United Kingdom. The parks sought to promote Sega games while providing entertainment based on its licenses. == Venues == Metropolis Metropolis was the first Sega- themed arcade in the UK, which opened in Mid 1992. The arcade was housed in the basement of Hamleys' Regent Street branch, as a SEGA-dedicated coin-op den. The arcade contained a rare R-360 motion simulator. The venue was later renamed under the Sega World brand, and eventually became an unbranded arcade known as called The Game Zone. The arcade was replaced with a franchised Game outlet at the end of 2003, which traded until October 2016. Planet Sega This Sega arcade was located at the Queens Ice and Bowl Bowling Alley in Bayswater, London. The Planet Sega name for the arcade area was scrapped in the early 2000s with the arcade area now being unbranded. Sega Megaworld Croydon/Sega Park Croydon A Sega arcade located on the top floor of a Debenhams store in Croydon, Surrey. The venue was later renamed Sega Park Croydon and was later replaced with a franchised Game Store. Sega Megaworld Harrow A Sega arcade located on the top floor of a Debenhams store in Harrow, London, located near Sega Park Harrow, which opened some years after Sega Megaworld. This venue was closed at an unknown date, sometime before 2002. Over the years it was open, the arcade housed games such as Darkstalkers: The Night Warriors, Alien vs. Predator, The Punisher, Virtua Fighter, Virtua Fighter 2, Virtua Fighter 3, Street Fighter Alpha, Virtua Racing, Daytona USA, SegaSonic the Hedgehog, The King of Fighters '96, X-Men: Children of the Atom, Marvel Super Heroes, X-Men vs. Street Fighter, Desert Tank, Virtual On: Cyber Troopers, Title Fight, Killer Instinct, Numan Athletics and the Mega-Tech System version of Sonic the Hedgehog. Sega Megaworld Romford A Sega arcade located in the Debenhams store in Romford, London. Little is known about it. SegaDome/Sega Park and Casino Colindale This venue was located in the Oriental City Shopping Centre, and first opened as SegaDome in Late 1993, being a smaller counterpart to Sega World in Bournemouth. It contained an R-360 machine (removed in later years), and a small bowling alley. This venue was renamed \\"Sega Park & Casino\\" in the late 1990s with the addition of fruit and slot machines after the Leisure Exchange buyout. The arcade closed for good on 1 June 2008 when Oriental City closed due to the buyout of the centre by a property developer. The centre building has since been demolished, and as of 2016, a Morrisons supermarket now occupies the area. Sega Park Acton Not much is known about this venue. The only known information about it is that it opened in 1994 and was located at Super Bowl in the Royale Leisure Park. The venue (now a TenPin Bowling Alley) still retains the arcade, although it is now unbranded. Sega Park Basildon This Sega Park was housed in the Eastgate Centre by the food court and opened sometime in October of 1996 or 1997. It was one of the venues sold to Leisure Exchange in 2000 and remained trading until 2005. The arcade's former shop unit houses a branch of Regis Hairdressers.  Sega Park Brighton (Leisure Exchange)  This Sega Park was opened by Leisure Exchange in 2002 and was located next to a Burger King in the same building, both of which were located near the Brighton Pier. The arcade mainly housed fruit and slot machines in the Sega Casino section, as well as some arcade games and claw machines. The venue closed in 2006 and later reopened under the Leisure Exchange name. The venue closed permanently in 2007, and has since sat empty with all its Leisure Exchange signage intact. The Burger King next door to the arcade was closed in mid-2015. Sega Park Bristol This Sega Park was housed in Arena One bowling (later Bristol Megabowl). the venue opened in 1995. The bowling alley itself was demolished in 2008 to make way for new flats. Sega Park Glasgow This was a short-lived Sega Park housed in a Hollywood Bowl location which only traded for around 2 years before closing. The bowling alley was demolished in 2006 to make way for a car park. Sega Park Harlow This Sega Park opened in 1997 in units 70-74 of the Harvey Centre. The games that were housed in this branch included Plasma Sword, Star Wars Racer Arcade, Virtua Fighter 3, Bust-A-Move 4, Silent Scope, Crazy Taxi, Cyber Troopers - Virtual On, L.A. Machineguns, Marvel Super Heroes vs. Street Fighter and Motor Raid. The arcade also contained an area dedicated to redemption games, which was replaced with a gambling area by the time this venue was sold to Leisure Exchange. This area led to this arcade's downfall due to chavs and teen gangs eyeing the venue and hassling customers for their money. The troubles of this led to the venue closing in 2003. Leisure Exchange attempted to re-open Sega Park in the former Pizza Hut unit in the Harvey Centre, which had failed. The arcade's former unit is now split into a Subway, nail salon and other outlets. Sega Park Harrow (Leisure Exchange) This Sega Park arcade was opened some time after Sega Megaworld Harrow opened, which was far larger and was about 15 minutes walk away from this venue. Games such as Tekken Tag Tournament, Silent Scope, House of the Dead and Time Crisis 3 among others, were housed here. It was housed on a single floor, with the video games placed at the front of the arcade and the \\"Sega Casino\\" section featuring gambling machines at the back. Not long after becoming the 'Leisure Exchange' around 2006, the venue became strictly a gambling venue. This venue was closed at an unknown date, likely around after November 2012 and the unit is now home to an E-Cigarette shop. Sega Park Holborn (Leisure Exchange) This tiny Sega Park is little known, and was branded as a \\"Sega Park and Casino\\" on the sign. This venue spent its last year under the Leisure Exchange name and was converted into a newsagents in 2007. and the Sonic Sign remained until around 2008 and was changed to fit in with the newsagents. Sega Park Reading Another little-known Sega Park arcade that was housed in Reading Super Bowl. The building was demolished in 2014 to make way for a new IKEA. Sega Park Southampton Sega Park in Bargate, 2009 This Sega Park opened in the summer of 1996 and was located on the first floor of the Bargate Shopping Centre in central Southampton. Alongside the other Sega Parks this one was also sold off to Leisure Exchange. It closed on 30 January 2013 after all traders inside the shopping centre were given notice to leave due to the ongoing sale of the property. It was the last Sega Park to close down, even though the arcade had been unaffiliated with Sega after the Leisure Exchange buyout. Sega Park Tower Hill (Leisure Exchange) This venue was opened by Leisure Exchange in the early 2000s, and as with most Sega Parks back then, housed some arcade games and many fruit and slot machines. By 2006, the venue became gambling only and so changed its name to Leisure Exchange. The Sega Park signs remained until Leisure Exchange's closure, This Sega Park was housed in the basement of the building it was housed in with the other unit in the building housing a Starbucks Coffee. The unit now houses a Coral Betting Shop. Sega Park Wood Green Not much is known about this venue. It was located in Unit 7 of The Mall Wood Green and traded until the early 2000s. The unit eventually became home to a Public House, and is now half of a branch of Lidl. Sega World Birmingham A Blockbuster outlet in Erdington, Birmingham had a Sega World arcade in the 1990s, situated on the first floor. The Arcade was later converted into a tanning salon, then to a UTC Gym, which encompassed the entire building after the Blockbuster's closure.  Sega World Bournemouth/Sega Park Bournemouth (Leisure Exchange) Originally opened on July 24, 1993 as Sega World, it was the first arcade to be opened up by Sega's European department known as 'Sega Operations UK'. The original floor plan design failed a fire safety check (entrances and exits & layout of machines being main factors) and the site was closed for 2 weeks. During this time, the floor was lowered and the entrance adjusted. The venue was split into three sections: * Ground floor: Various arcade machines (most notably a pair of R360's), and a raised area to the right that housed the 'Sega Shop', which sold various video games, consoles, T-shirts and other merchandise (closed in 1995). * Middle section: Reception area (taken out in 1997), more arcade machines and two karaoke rooms. * Back section: Four half size bowling lanes (removed from site in 1994), and a Burger King restaurant (closed in 2001). The Sega World name was changed to 'Sega Park' in 1998 due to Sega opening the substantially larger 'SegaWorld London' in the Trocadero in 1996. This one was sold alongside the other Sega Parks to Leisure Exchange on the 31st of March 2000, marking the end for Sega Operations UK on the same date (Sega Europe handled the overseas arcades). Eventually, the venue became difficult to run for Leisure Exchange, who sold a small portion of the building to be used as a Gala Casino (now a Grosvenor Casino), who would later completely purchase the premises contract for the building, leaving only a small single-floored arcade home to Leisure Exchange. In early 2005, an attempt was made to relocate the arcade to a smaller premises nearby, however local police raised objections on the grounds of \\"potential high crime and disorder\\". After the Sega rights expired, Leisure Exchange renamed the arcade under their own branding, under the title 'Leisure Exchange and Quasar Elite' in early 2006, which was to reflect a new Quasar facility that had opened at the rear of the arcade in the former Bowling Alley. In 2010, the premises were renamed again to simply \\"Amusements\\" and the Quasar facility was closed down in November due to flooding issues. In 2013, the arcade was sold to a former Bowlplex manager, who renamed the venue as \\"Fun Central\\" with more emphasis on ticket redemption titles, penny pushers and slot machines then video games. Older titles such as Ferrari F355 (still with Sega Park sticker attached), House Of The Dead 4 and Daytona USA were originally present but have all been removed and replaced by newer titles. A 3 player deluxe setup of Outrun 2 Special Tours (SP) and Time Crisis 4 are the sole remaining titles from the Sega Park era (the former sourced from Sega Park Southampton when it closed). The arcade was refurbished in 2014/2015 and have added a cafe called ShakeXpress (was later removed). in 2016 Fun Central become \\"cashless\\" with the introduction of a pay-as-you-go card facility. In November 2019, a bowling alley was opened in the rear of the arcade which ironically, was where the former bowling alley was during the Sega World days. Sega World/Sega Park Tamworth Strykers Bowl in Tamworth, Staffordshire was home to a Sega World arcade from the early to mid-1990s. It was situated in a large upstairs area, which had previously housed a Quasar laser tag centre. During the late 1990s, Sega World was moved to a much smaller downstairs location and was renamed as Sega Park. The upstairs location was converted into an Arena Health and Fitness gym. In 2001, Strykers Bowl was sold by then owners Leamore Leisure Ltd. to Namco Operations Europe Ltd. During the process of the sale, the Sega Park arcade was renamed as Namco Station, A name that the arcade has since retained. Sega World Wolverhampton Located in a former AMF bowling alley in Bushbury, called Strykers. During the 1990s, it was home to Sega World arcade. The location was then replaced by a smaller unbranded arcade and Pool Tables. The Bowling Alley itself closed in 2013 and was destroyed by a fire in December of that year. Sega Zone Brixton This Sega arcade opened in the 90's on Electric Avenue. Today the building houses a William Hill Betting Shop. Sega Zone Catford Another Sega arcade that traded in the 90's on Rushey Green, Catford. Sega Zone Woolwich A Sega arcade which shared a building with a Pub called The Shakespeare Today the building houses a branch of Quicksilver Amusements. SegaWorld London (Funland) SegaWorld London's official logo In 1994, Nick Leslau and business partner Nigel Wray acquired the Piccadilly Trocadero.The Guardian (London) - Final Edition July 29, 2011 Friday The Friday interview: Entrepreneur hopes his ship will come in with quay development: Property mogul Nick Leslau has done the deal of his life - for historic St Katharine Docks in the heart of the City BYLINE: Julia Kollewe SECTION: GUARDIAN FINANCIAL PAGES; Pg. 31 They arranged a deal with Sega to open an indoor theme park inside the building. Construction began in January 1996. London's Sega theme park kicked off at the height of its mascot Sonic the Hedgehog's popularity on September 7, 1996. It featured a number of indoor rides, coin-operated arcade machines and a Sega merchandise shop. Initially its hours were 10 a.m. to midnight every day but Christmas Day. It was heavily promoted in the UK's Sonic the Comic, where competitions were run to win items from the SegaWorld shop, and out on the streets where tokens could often be found for discounted or free entry, and free T-shirts were distributed. Leslau says that he became discouraged by the deal on the theme park's opening day: > Sega could not deliver what they said they'd deliver. ... It looked amazing, > but their rides were not capable of delivering the number of people they > needed to deliver to support the operation. People were queuing for ages. > ... It was a question of over-anticipation and under-delivery. Leslau and Wray bought back the lease on the Trocadero in 1997.The Daily Telegraph (LONDON) July 18, 2007 Wednesday PRIVATE EQUITY Merlin conjures up leaseback deal But questions could be raised over aggressive private equity methods, writes James Quinn BYLINE: James Quinn SECTION: CITY; Pg. 3 In 2000 they renamed the whole establishment \\"Funland\\", after SegaWorld was making a loss of £2.4 million a year.The Times (London) February 3, 2000, Thursday Chorion cuts its Trocadero losses BYLINE: Ian Cundell Funland was originally the arcade in the basement floor next to the Pepsi Max drop, which shared the same building as SegaWorld. After taking over SegaWorld, Funland shut their basement arcade and the top floors remained open, along with McDonald's on the 3rd floor until autumn 2002 when the main entrance known as the Rocket Escalator, was shut. At that time the dodgems were moved from the 3rd to the 1st floor and a new lower ground floor was re-opened. The arcade was arguably the largest and most popular in England with games in 2011 including DJMax Technika, Pump It Up Fiesta, Pump It Up Pro, Street Fighter IV, and Initial D Arcade Stage 4. In May 2011, the Rocket Escalator was completely removed during building works for the hotel that would use the top two floors of the building. Funland closed on 3 July 2011, following a long running dispute with the landlord over rent. The manager of Funland confirmed the dance game cabinets, including Pump Fiesta EX and Para Para Paradise 2nd Mix would be moved to Las Vegas Arcade, in Soho. Other Funland machines moved to The Heart of Gaming arcade in London. Related Places A Sega World was located in Shanghai, although little was known about it. According to reports found on website UK Resistance, the basement arcade in Xu Jia Hui Shanghai operated a series of UFO Catcher machines and Sega arcade machines long after the demise of its Western equivalents. The arcade was adorned with artworks and fascias dating back to Sonic's heyday, on top of a largely Dreamcast-era look in meeting with some of the newer machines. Games featured in the arcade, identified by photographic records, included OutRun, Time Crisis, House of the Dead and an installation of the cult oddity Waku Waku Sonic Patrol Car for younger patrons. Most notably, it also had Initial D Arcade Stage version 4. As of October 2009, it also had Taiko no Tatsujin 12 (Asia version), Wangan Midnight Maximum Tune 3, and Mario Kart Arcade GP despite being Namco properties. In September 2007, another Sega arcade on the 9th floor of the New World shopping mall opened, despite the revamping of the adjacent food court. There were multiple signs near and in the mall itself in an effort to promote the arcade, a marked contrast from the past where its presence was only known by the noise that emanated to adjacent floors. It changed its name to Player's Arena (though it retained images of Sonic and many Sega cabinets) and had expanded to two floors (due to the addition of large-scale rides and photo booths).

It is an example of carrier current signaling. Power stations transmit a ripple signal on the main transmission lines when off-peak rates start (often around 10 pm). This ripple noise is picked up by the Zellweger, which after a random delay turns the hot water heater on. The noise is often picked up by other equipment, especially audio amplifiers and stereos and the noise can cause problems with other electrical devices. It is especially audible from ceiling fans running at low speed. Even some telephone lines can pick up the noise. The noise can be particularly obtrusive from some fluorescent light systems. Newer electrical meters incorporate this technology into the meter. \\"Time of use\\" meters charge electricity to the current tariff within half an hour, giving customers incentive to run appliances such as dishwashers, pool pumps and clothes dryers during the night. == Impact == Power stations have plenty of unused capacity late at night but must keep running as they take days to shut down. Off-peak rates are used as an incentive for customers to use this surplus capacity and to reduce the amount of peak demand. This can produce cheaper power by delaying the need to build new power stations and reduce environmental impact. The random time delay in the Zellweger means that the power stations aren't hit with a huge demand when all the hot water systems turn on at the same time; rather, the load is spread over a greater time period. == History in Australia == Example capture: The bright line at 50 Hz is the power frequency, followed by odd harmonics at 150 Hz, 250 Hz and so on. The ripple being turned on and off is clearly visible at 1050 Hz Originally time-clocks were used; however, they can easily lose accurate time and are not easily adjusted for daylight saving time. Zellwegers were first introduced in Australia in 1953, but were not compliant with modern harmonic disturbance standards. The second generation was introduced in the 1970s and was more reliable. A variety of devices can still be seen across Australia. In at least some parts of Sydney, the ripple frequency is 1042 Hz. The signal usually consists of several bursts of a few seconds on and off, followed by a period of up to 50 seconds on. This is coded to affect only selected equipment. Occurrences are very frequent, sometimes several times an hour throughout the day, not just at evening and morning off-peak times. == Radioactive risk of one type of Zellweger meter == Zellweger Relay ZE 22/3 with outside cover removed. Zellweger ZE22/3 contain low-risk radioactive material, and must be only handled by authorised people as breakage of the glass tube could cause a dangerous situation by releasing the radioactive material. The deviceETU bulletin reportedly contains a 'glow tube' containing tritium and radium. == New Zealand equipment == A few images are attached from an older electromechanical Zellweger ripple plant near Silverdale. Many of these Zellweger plants are still in use in New Zealand. Frequency used is 1050 Hz, superimposed upon the 50 Hz mains. Solid state Zellweger equipment is used as well, which can directly inject into the 22 kV or 33 kV sub transmission mains instead of the 11 kV mains as with these older Zellweger plants.

It should not be confused with sialadenosis (sialosis) which is a non-inflammatory enlargement of the major salivary glands. Sialadenitis can be further classed as acute or chronic. Acute sialadenitis is an acute inflammation of a salivary gland which may present itself as a red, painful swelling that is tender to touch. Chronic sialadenitis is typically less painful but presents as recurrent swellings, usually after meals, without redness. Causes of sialadenitis are varied, including bacterial (most commonly Staphylococcus aureus), viral and autoimmune conditions. ==Types== Acute ;Predisposing factors * sialolithiasis * decreased flow (dehydration, post- operative, drugs) * poor oral hygiene * exacerbation of low grade chronic sialoadenitis ;Clinical features * painful swelling * reddened skin * edema of the cheek, periorbital region and neck * low grade fever * malaise * raised ESR, CRP, leucocytosis * purulent exudate from duct punctum Chronic ;Clinical features * unilateral * mild pain / swelling * common after meals * duct orifice is reddened and flow decreases * may or may not have visible/palpable stone. * Parotid gland ** recurrent painful swellings * Submandibular gland ** usually secondary to sialolithiasis or stricture == Signs and Symptoms == Sialadenitis is swelling and inflammation of the parotid, submandibular, or sublingual major salivary glands. It may be acute or chronic, infective or autoimmune.  Acute  * Acute sialadenitis secondary to obstruction (sialolithiasis) is characterised by increasingly, painful swelling of 24–72 hours, purulent discharge and systemic manifestations.  Chronic  * Chronic sialadenitis causes intermittent, recurrent periods of tender swellings. Chronic sclerosing sialadenitis is commonly unilateral and can mimic a tumour.  Autoimmune  * Autoimmune sialadenitis (i.e Sjogren’s syndrome) causes unilateral or bilateral painless swellings unless there is a secondary infection.  Infection  * The most common salivary gland infection is mumps. It is characterised by bilateral swelling of the parotid glands, however other major salivary glands may also be affected in around 10% of cases. The swelling persists for about a week, along with low grade fever and general malaise. * Recurrent parotitis of childhood is characterised by periods of pain and swelling in the parotid gland accompanied by a fever  Complications  {  + !COMPLICATION !TIMEFRAME !LIKELIHOOD - Abscess Infection may spread along the fascial planes of the neck causing a potentially serious complication. Seldomly this can affect the spaces in the floor of the mouth and can result in Ludwig angina. Short term Medium - Dental decay Hypofunction of the salivary gland will reduce saliva production causing decreased protection against acid erosion and increased risk of dental decay. Long term High - Postparotidectomy complications (facial deformity or facial nerve palsy) Temporary facial nerve palsy occurs in around one third to two thirds of patients following superficial parotidectomy. Cosmetic deformity is relatively minor, although symptoms may recur in up to 11-13%, of these not all require further treatment. The occurrence of recurrent symptoms is lower (4%) for subtotal parotidectomy. The choice of the surgical procedure is determined by the extent of the disease and the patient’s preference. The pattern of facial weakness is likely to include one or more branches of the nerve and is likely to be panfacial due to the widespread fibrosis within the gland. Normally complete recovery occurs within 3 to 6 months with permanent palsy occurring in <1%.The prevalence of seroma, haematoma or significant infection should be less than 5%. Variable Low } == Causes == Sialadenitis can be caused by cancer, autoimmune conditions, viral and bacterial infections, idiopathic causes or stones formed mainly from calculus. It was thought that morphological characteristics of the salivary ducts could also be a contributing factor, as stagnation of saliva due to these could perhaps cause an increased incidence of sialadenitis. However, one study found no statistically significant difference between the length of ducts or the angles they incorporate within them and the likelihood of developing sialadenitis, although this study only had a small sample size of 106. The study also confirmed that age, gender, side of face and degree of sialadenitis had no impact on the length of the ducts or the angles formed within the ducts. Viral pathogens more commonly cause sialadenitis in comparison to bacterial pathogens. Mumps is the most common virus that affects the parotid and submandibular glands, with the parotid gland affected most often out of these two. Other viruses that have been shown to cause sialadenitis in both these glands include HIV, coxsackie, and parainfluenza. Classically, HIV parotitis is either asymptomatic or a non-painful swelling, which is not characteristic of sialadenitis. Some common bacterial causes are S. aureus, S. pyogenes, viridans streptococci and H. influenzae. Autoimmune conditions that can cause sialadenitis include Sjögren’s syndrome, sarcoidosis, and granulomatosis with polyangiitis. Sjögren’s syndrome and Sarcoidosis are the most common causes of chronic sialadenitis and are often closely associated with it, and in many cases are believed to be the primary cause, although often with other contributing factors present also. One well known form of sarcoidosis is known as Heerfordt’s syndrome which is characterized by facial nerve palsy, enlargement of the parotid and anterior uveitis. One study came to the conclusion that the presence of salivary calculi is the main indicator for the removal of the submandibular gland, in patients where neoplasia is absent. This was because 82% of glands removed in an ENT department in Stockholm were found to have salivary calculi within them and all of these cases but one had chronic sialadenitis. A mucous retention cyst was found in one patient, but this was not considered to have contributed to the sialadenitis in this case. The duration of the sialadenitis was found to be closely linked to atrophy, fibrosis and the degree of the inflammation in another study, which looked primarily at microliths found in the ducts and glands. Liths were also found to be related to the duration that the individual had symptoms of sialadenitis, whereas microliths were found in normal glands and varied with age. Microliths could possibly form reservoirs, thus allowing infection to ascend further towards the glands but this could not be confirmed due to the liths and microliths being distinct in this study. However, many glands did show only very minimal variations, which could allow the opportunity for more conservative treatment instead of the surgical removal of the affected gland in the future. == Histopathology == Initial stage of acute bacterial sialadenitis involvesAvery, C. (2018). Sialadenitis - Symptoms, diagnosis and treatment  BMJ Best Practice. [online] Bestpractice.bmj.com. Available at: https://bestpractice.bmj.com/topics/en-gb/1038 [Accessed 2 Dec. 2018]. the accumulation of bacteria, neutrophils and inspissated fluid in lumen of ductal structures. Damage to ductal epithelium results in sialodochitis (periductal inflammation), accumulation of neutrophils in glandular stroma, followed by acini necrosis with microabscesses formation. Recurrent episodes results in chronic stage, which involves the establishment of periductal lymph follicles and further destruction of salivary acini.  Infective sialadenitis  Generally, in acute bacterial and viral sialadenitis cases, the lobular architecture of the gland is maintained or may be slightly expanded. Areas of liquefaction, indicating presence of abscess, may also be seen microscopically. In Acute bacterial sialadenitis, acinar destruction with interstitial neutrophil infiltrates is observed. Small abscesses with necrosis are common. In Viral sialadenitis, vacuolar changes are seen in the acini with lymphocytic and monocytic infiltrate found in the interstitium Cytomegalovirus (CMV) sialadenitis may show no gross symptoms Chronic sialadenitis (also known as lymphoepithelial sialadenitis (LESA)) presents with 50% of which are monoclonal by PCR while mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma has ducts surrounded by broad coronas of monocytoid cells, infiltration of interfollicular region by monocytoid cells or atypical plasma cells containing Dutcher bodies, monoclonality by immunohistochemistry or flow cytometry, and monocytoid infiltrates in regional lymph nodes.Tanakchi, S. (2018). Sialadenitis. [online] Pathologyoutlines.com. Available at: http://www.pathologyoutlines.com/topic/salivaryglandssialadenitis.html [Accessed 1 Dec. 2018]. Histologically, chronic sialadenitis can appear from unremarkable to a firm tan with expansion or atrophy of the lobular structure depending on the degree of inflammation and chronicity. Salivary stones (Sialolith) may be evident with cystic dilation of the salivary ducts and periductal fibrosis. Mucus extravasation may also be observed. Common observations of chronic sialadenitis include chronic inflammatory infiltrate (lymphocytes, plasma cells and macrophages), fibrosis, acinar atrophy, mucous cell metaplasia of the ductal system is observed. In Sialoithiasis, concomitant squamous metaplasia may be observed in the salivary ducts with dark calcific stone fragments.  Chronic sialadenitis  Chronic sclerosing sialadenitis has various degrees of inflammation which can include focal lymphocytic sialadenitis to widespread salivary gland cirrhosis with obliteration of acini. This can be a result of obstruction of salivary ducts by microliths (due to associated intercurrent infections), or a result of immune reaction with the formation of secondary lymph follicles. Chronic sclerosing sialadenitis is characterised by presence of three major criteria of dense lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate, storiform pattern of fibrosis and obliterative phlebitis. Minor criteria include phlebitis without obliteration of the lumen and increased numbers of eosinophils. There are two features relatively inconsistent with diagnosis of IgG4-related disease which are the presence of epithelioid cell granulomas and a prominent neutrophilic infiltrate. Sclerosing polycystic sialadenitis histologically resembles sclerosing adenosis/fibrocystic change of breast tissue. It composes of acini and ductal elements embedded in dense sclerotic stroma, and has a characteristic finding of large acinar cells present with abundant eosinophilic cytoplasmic granules. In addition, it may also present ductal epithelial proliferation which could range from hyperplasia, atypia to DCIS- like. Its stroma may show focal adipose tissue with myxoid change and variable radial scar. At present, there are immunohistochemical studies of limited value only. It is cytologically difficult to diagnose this type of sialadenitis due to the rarity of this condition and the presence of variable cell types in a cystic background. In autoimmune sialadenitis, activation of T and B cells that infiltrate the interstitium occurs due to a response to an unidentified antigen present in the salivary gland parenchyma. This response then results in acini destruction and the formation of epimyoepithelial islands.  Autoimmune sialadenitis  Most histological appearance of autoimmune sialadenitis are similar to that of Myoepithelial sialadenitis. In general, a diffuse to multinodular expansion is observed in myoepithelial sialadenitis. A distinguishing feature is the presence of epithelial- myoepithelial islands infiltrated by lymphocytes. Germinal centers may form with the progression of lymphoid infiltrate resulting in acinar atrophy. Proliferation of ductal epithelium-myoepithelium arises causing the obliteration of ductal lumina causing the formation of the epithelial- myoepithelial islands. Granulomatosis with polyangiitis may have areas of liquefaction necrosis caused by vasculitis. A triad of vasculitis, necrosis and granulomatous inflammation may be observed. In secondary Sjogren’s syndrome, periglandular fibrosis with the absence of inflammation may also be observed in addition to that of Myoepithelial sialadenitis from the progressive systemic sclerosis. Sarcoid has tight epithelioid granulomas and lymphoid infiltrate. Chronic Sclerosing Sialadenitis has peridutcal fibrosis with a dense lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate with lymphoid follicles. Eosinophils may be seen. == Diagnosis == According to the British Medical Journal (BMJ) Best Practice on Sialadenitis, there are multiple factors to consider during the diagnosis of sialadenitis, including history, presenting signs and symptoms, followed by appropriate investigations in relation to the presenting case. Other factors to also consider include the type of gland affected as well as underlying conditions such as an autoimmune disease or ductal stones.  Acute bacterial sialadenitis  May present with a history of recent surgical intervention or use of medications such as antihistamines, antidepressants, or anticholinergic agents. These medications may lead to objective hypofunction or subjective feeling of a dry mouth without hypofunction. There may also be a history of decrease in salivary volume secondary to a systemic disease. A unilateral or bilateral painful swelling of the parotid or submandibular regions may be present upon a physical examination. This could be accompanied by an external displacement of the earlobe usually adjacent to an inflamed parotid gland. Pus suppuration from major salivary gland duct openings may occur spontaneously or after manipulation of the affected gland. Mandibular trismus is a rare finding but may be present with larger swellings. Dysphagia may also be present in some cases. Fever may also be noted, whilst spiking temperatures may be suggestive of an abscess formation.  Chronic recurrent sialadenitis  The occurrence of chronic recurrent episodes may be due to underlying Sjogren's syndrome or ductal abnormalities. Prodrome of tingling in the gland preceding pain and swelling may be reported in such cases.  Chronic sclerosing sialadenitis  Typically presents unilaterally in submandibular gland that cannot be differentiated clinically from a neoplasm, with pain an inconsistent finding.  Obstructive sialadenitis  Formation of stones in glandular ducts (sialoliths) can result in the development of obstructive sialadenitis. There may be a history of abrupt episodic swelling of the parotid or submandibular gland which is usually painful. These episodes typically occur around meal times, lasting 2 – 3 hours and gradually subsides.  Autoimmune sialadenitis  Characterised by persistent, asymptomatic bilateral swelling of parotid glands, and may represent as a manifestation of more widespread systemic disease. Dry eyes and dry mouth are commonly present and may be indicative of concomitant connective tissue disease (e.g. SLE, RA, or scleroderma). Oral candidiasis may also be present. Common key diagnostic factors 1\\\\. Fever – may present with an acute infective sialadenitis or autoimmune aetiology suggestive of an infection or inflammation. 2\\\\. Pain and dysphagia (ie. difficulty swallowing) – usually unilateral affecting the parotid or submandibular regions, with worse pain during eating and swallowing. 3\\\\. Facial swelling – usually unilaterally and affecting parotid region, under the tongue, or below the jaw. May have acute onset and may have a history of repeated episodes. 4\\\\. Recurrent painful swellings – indicative of chronic recurrent sialadenitis, may have similar signs and symptoms to an acute episode. 5\\\\. Pus exudation from salivary gland openings – indicative of bacterial infection, may occur on manipulation of the affected gland or spontaneously. Other common diagnostic factors to consider 1\\\\. Episodic swelling during meal times – may present as an acute salivary gland swelling without visible salivary flow from ductal openings. While palpation of affected glad may reveal an indurated salivary gland and presence of a sialolith. 2\\\\. Use of xerostomic medications – these medications will result in a decreased salivary flow rate which can predispose to infections of glands. Examples of medications that may contribute to this include antihistamines, antidepressant, and anticholinergic agents. 3\\\\. Recent surgical intervention under general anaesthetic – this could predispose to sialadenitis due to direct effects of anaesthetic agents used and volume depletion from surgery. 4\\\\. Dry eyes and mouth – dryness affecting the eyes and oral cavity are key symptoms of Sjogren’s syndrome and may be seen in combination with a connective tissue disease such as rheumatoid arthritis, scleroderma, or dermatomyositis. 5\\\\. Oral candidiasis – may be present in cases of Sjogren’s syndrome or in associate with a connective tissue disorder. Key factors to also consider which are less common 1\\\\. Mandibular trismus – restricted mouth opening to its full extent (of approximately 40mm) may be present with large swellings typically due to acute bacterial infection of affected gland. 2\\\\. Respiratory distress – this could present in the form of stridor, use or reliance on accessory muscles of respiratory, nasal flaring, or wheeze. These signs may develop if glandular swelling is significant enough, resulting in airway obstruction. 3\\\\. Cranial nerve palsy – swelling increases the risk of compression of cranial nerves VII, IX and XII. Other diagnostic factors which are less common 1\\\\. Connective tissue disorder or Sjogren’s syndrome – history of Sjogren’s syndrome, or a concomitant connect tissue disorder such as systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, or scleroderma. 2\\\\. Recurrent painless swellings – indicative of underlying autoimmune aetiology. 3\\\\. Displacement of earlobe – may be present when swelling of the parotid gland is present. 4\\\\. Prodrome of tingling in the affected gland 5\\\\. Swelling on hard palate Diagnostic tests Tests available as part of diagnosing sialadenitis include: # Culture and sensitivity testing of exudate from salivary duct. Culturing of purulent discharge is advisable in acute presentations of sialadenitis to allow targeted antibiotic therapy. # Full blood count if infection is suspected. # Facial radiographs such as dental radiographic views should be taken to exclude an obstructive element due to presence of sialolith or evolving abscess. However, sialoliths with low calcium phosphate content may not be visible. ==Treatment== In chronic recurrent sialadenitis or chronic sclerosing sialadenitis, acute attacks are managed with conservative therapies such as hydration, analgesics (mainly NSAIDs), sialogogues to stimulate salivary secretion, and regular, gentle gland massage.bestpractice.bmj.com > Sialadenitis Last updated: Sep 08, 2011 If infection is present, appropriate cultures should be obtained, followed by empirical antibiotic therapy initially, for example amoxicillin/clavulanate or clindamycin which cover oral flora. If there are attacks more than approximately 3 times per year or severe attacks, surgical excision of the affected gland should be considered. == Epidemiology == Sialadenitis of the parotid gland accounts for a much larger percentage of hospital admissions than sialadenitis of the submandibular gland. Submandibular sialadenitis has been said to only account for 10% of all cases diagnosed as sialadenitis. Chronic sialadenitis has been classified as a relatively common presentation, whereas bacterial sialadenitis and sclerosing polycystic sialadenitis are defined as rare. Chronic sclerosing sialadenitis has been shown to affect predominantly males who are over the age of 50, with 40% of cases having an allergic disease, such as chronic sinusitis or bronchial asthma. One study found that 112 patients from England and Wales ranging from 12 to 81 years of age complained of symptoms from their diagnosed sialadenitis, with the group having a mean age of 39 and a standard deviation of 16 years. The study also found that more patients underwent surgery to treat their sialadenitis between the ages of 20 and 69 years but that there were many more patients who complained of symptoms between the ages of 20 and 49, and then went on to be diagnosed with sialadenitis. In each group studied, most patients suffered from sialadenitis in their twenties but there was also found to be a significant number of females whose symptoms started in their thirties and forties. More women reported symptoms that were confirmed to be sialadenitis than men in this study, which may suggest that females are more likely to be affected but more research would need to be done to be sure of this. A study done on the epidemiology of sialadenitis in the United States of America found that acute suppurative parotitis is responsible for 0.01-0.02% of hospital admissions, with the submandibular gland accounting for 10% of cases of sialadenitis in the major salivary glands in this population. This study found that there was no predilection to any race, sex or age, although it was noted that sialadenitis in general tended to occur in people who are debilitated, dehydrated or older. Bacterial sialadenitis is uncommon nowadays and is usually associated with sialoliths. A study involving hospitals in the United Kingdom found that the incidence of admissions for sialadenitis is 27.5 per million of the population, with the most common cause being mumps which causes a viral infection in the salivary gland. Ascending acute bacterial parotitis used to be a common perimortal event but today this is no longer the case due to antibiotics and basic modern care which means that patients will be much less likely to become dehydrated. == See also == *Sialoendoscopy == References  External links == Category:Inflammations Category:Salivary gland pathology ","title":"Sialadenitis"},{"id":"5557701","text":"Goodbye Cool World! is the third release by DIY collective Bomb the Music Industry!.

Giuseppe \\"Peppino\\" Impastato was born in Cinisi, in the then province of Palermo, into a Mafia family. His father had been sent into internal exile during the fascist era, and was a close friend of Mafia boss Gaetano Badalamenti. His father's brother-in-law, Cesare Manzella, was an important mafia boss who was killed in car bomb attack in 1963. As an adolescent, Peppino broke off relations with his father – who kicked him out of the house – and initiated a series of political and cultural Antimafia activities.Giuseppe Impastato: his actions, his murder, the investigation and the cover up , by Tom Behan, Centro Siciliano di Documentazione \\"Giuseppe Impastato\\" According to his younger brother Giovanni Impastato, Peppino's Antimafia activity might have been triggered by the brutal murder of his uncle by marriage, Cesare Manzella, who was blown to pieces by a car bomb in April 1963 when Peppino was fifteen years old. Pieces of his uncle – who was the Mafia boss of Cinisi at the time – were found stuck to lemon trees hundreds of meters from the crater where the car had been.Dickie, Cosa Nostra, p. 347-55 Peppino was traumatized: \\"Is this really Mafia? If this is Mafia I will fight it for the rest of my life ...\\" Condividevo ma non ho avuto lo stesso coraggio... Interview with Giovanni Impastato, Girodivite, March 2004. ==Political activist== In 1965 Peppino Impastato founded the newsletter L'idea socialista and joined the left-wing PSIUP party (Italian Socialist Party of Proletarian Unity). He took a leading role in the activities of the new revolutionary movements that sprung up in 1968. He led struggles by Cinisi peasants whose land had been expropriated to build the third runway at Palermo's Punta Raisi Airport, as well as disputes involving construction workers and the unemployed. In 1975 he set up Music and Culture with other young people in Cinisi. The group organised debates, film, theatre and music shows and started a self-financed radio station named Radio Aut in 1976. Peppino Impastato used humor and satire as his weapon against the Mafia. In his popular daily radio programme Onda pazza (Crazy Wave) he mocked politicians and mafiosi alike. On a daily basis he exposed the crimes and dealings of mafiosi in Mafiopoli (Cinisi) and the activities of Tano Seduto (Sitting Tano), a thinly disguised pseudonym of Gaetano Badalamenti, the capomafia of Cinisi. Nevertheless, it was Peppino Impastato and his friends that were considered to be the real nuisance and 'undesirable elements' by the authorities in town, not the 'respected' men such as Badalamenti. Peppino's brother Giovanni declared before the Italian Antimafia Commission: \\"It seemed that Badalamenti was well liked by the carabinieri as he was calm, reliable, and always liked a chat. It almost felt like he was doing them a favour in that nothing ever happened in Cinisi, it was a quiet little town. If anything, we were subversives who made nuisances of ourselves. This was what the carabinieri thought. When I had a chance to speak to one of them – something which didn't happen often because I didn't really trust them – I realised that it was a widely held belief that Tano Badalamenti was a gentleman and it was us who were the trouble-makers.\\" [...] \\"I often used to see them walking arm in arm with Tano Badalamenti and his henchmen. You can't have faith in the institutions when you see the police arm in arm with mafiosi.\\"Extracts from Parliament's Anti-Mafia Commission report on the Impastato case Impastato clearly understood the danger represented by Badalamenti, and Badalamenti clearly understood the danger of Peppino Impastato. Impastato’s struggles were too public and determined for the Mafia to allow his tireless activities to continue. Apparently, his father tried to protect him but unfortunately he was killed in a car accident in 1977, which might have been a premeditated murder. Apparently, Badalamenti waited until after Impastato’s father had died to give the order to kill Impastato. Storia di Peppino il ribelle, La Repubblica, May 9, 2011 ==Murder== In 1978 Peppino Impastato stood as a candidate in the Cinisi council elections for Proletarian Democracy (Democrazia proletaria). He was killed during the election campaign on the night of May 8–9, by a charge of TNT placed under his body, which had been stretched over the local railway line – a sinister twist of fate to the car-bomb that had killed his uncle and initiated Peppino's revolt against the Mafia. The same day Christian-Democrat former Prime Minister Aldo Moro's corpse was discovered on Via Caetani in Rome. Two days later voters in Cinisi elected him as a councillor.http://content.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,2047829,00.html Initially press, police and investigative magistrates considered that Peppino Impastato had been a left-wing terrorist who had tried to bomb a railway line, but caused his own death. After the discovery of a letter written by Impastato several months before his death, authorities started talking about suicide. Thanks to the efforts of his brother Giovanni Impastato, his mother Felicia Bartolotta Impastato (who publicly broke relations with their mafia relatives), his fellow activists, and the Centro siciliano di documentazione (founded in Palermo in 1977; Giuseppe Impastato's name was added to its masthead in 1980), the Mafia's responsibility for the crime would be identified after a struggle of many years. Following a statement made by a former member of the Cinisi Mafia, the pentito Salvatore Palazzolo who had turned state witness, and named Badalamenti as the instigator of the murder, the investigation was formally reopened in June 1996, and in November the following year an arrest warrant was issued for Badalamenti. In 1998 a committee was formed by the Italian Parliament's permanent Antimafia Commission to investigate the 'Impastato case'. On December 6, 2000, it issued a report which outlined the responsibilities of State officials in leading the investigations astray. On March 5, 2001 the Court of Assises declared Vito Palazzolo to be guilty of murder, initially handing down a thirty-year sentence, Sentenza nel procedimento penale contro Palazzolo Vito, Corte di Assise di Palermo, March 5, 2001 however, the Court later overturned his conviction. Gaetano Badalamenti was given a life sentence on April 11, 2002. Sentenza nel procedimento penale contro Badalamenti Gaetano, Corte di Assise di Palermo, April 11, 2002 Peppino’s mother, Felicia Bartolotta Impastato, reacted to the conviction in a very dignified manner: \\"I never have had any feelings of revenge. All I have done is call for justice for my son’s death. I have to confess that, after so many years of waiting, I had lost faith; I never thought we would reach this point. Now I feel a great deal of contentment and of satisfaction. I always knew what had happened. Badalamenti used to call my husband Luigi to complain about Peppino, and my husband begged him not to kill the boy.\\" ==In popular culture== *In the 1994 Italian TV series La piovra, , the character of Daniele Rannisi, a young man who disavows his family connection to the Mafia and starts a satirical pirate radio show denouncing their activities, was based on Impastato. *In 2000, the movie I cento passi, directed by Marco Tullio Giordana, was released about the life and death of Peppino Impastato. \\"I cento passi\\" (one hundred steps) was the distance between the Impastato's house and the house of Tano Badalamenti. *In 2004 the song \\"I cento passi\\" was released by Italian band \\"Modena City Ramblers\\" in the memory of Peppino Impastato. *The 2011 album La cretina commedia by Italian \\"ska\\" band \\"Talco\\" is a concept album about the life and work of Peppino Impastato. ==See also== * List of victims of the Sicilian Mafia *List of journalists killed in Europe ==References== * Behan, Tom.

For more than two centuries, his ancestors had served in the Imperial Russian Navy, and seven had been awarded the Order of St. George, the highest military award of the Russian Empire. Essen was also regarded as the most prominent admiral of the Russian naval force during World War I. ==Biography== Coat of arms of the Essen family. Nikolai Ottovich von Essen was born on in St. Petersburg, Russia to Imperial Senator Otto Vilgelmovich von Essen, into the wealthy noble family of Essen. Early on in his life, Essen received home education, he was well-educated and fluent at English, French, Russian, and of course, his native language German.Essen, Nikolai Ottovich He graduated from the Naval Cadet Corps in 1880, after a two- year foreign cruise, attended the engineering department of the Nikolayev Naval Academy from 1883 to 1886. He was commissioned as a lieutenant in 1891 and served with the Russian Pacific Fleet from 1892 to 1896, and with the Russian Mediterranean Squadron from 1897.Kowner, pp. 113–114. In the early part of his career, he commanded Minesweeper No. 120 (1897–98), the gunboat Grozyachiy (1898–1900), and the steamship Slavianka (1901–1902) in the Black Sea. After a brief assignment as an instructor at the Naval Cadet Corps, he was appointed captain of the cruiser (1902–1904), which was stationed at Vladivostok. Nikolai von Essen as commander of Novik At the start of the Russo-Japanese War, Admiral Stepan Makarov reassigned Essen to command the battleship at Port Arthur. After the disastrous Battle of the Yellow Sea, Essen also commanded the land-based defences at the entrance to Port Arthur. During the last weeks of the Japanese siege, he moved Sevastopol out of the relative safety of the inner harbour to use her firepower to help repulse repeated Japanese attacks. However, on hearing of the surrender of Port Arthur, he moved Sevastopol into deeper water and then scuttled her, making her the only battleship that the Imperial Japanese Navy could not raise after the war. He was sent as a prisoner of war to Japan, but was paroled after less than two months, and returned to St Petersburg to a hero's welcome. For his actions, Essen was awarded the Order of St. George (3rd degree) and promoted to captain. After the end of the war, Essen became the first captain of the British-built armoured cruiser . He was promoted to rear admiral in 1908 and appointed commander-in-chief of the Russian Baltic Fleet in 1909 when this position was created. He was promoted to admiral in 1913. Essen, from lessons learned in the war against Japan and the mutiny of the Black Sea Fleet, urged far-reaching reforms and modernisation of the Imperial Russian Navy. He recognised early the importance of submarines and aircraft, and sought to promote younger officers based on their knowledge of modern strategy and tactics, also establishing a naval training academy at Kronstadt. Above all, he pushed for the operational autonomy of the Baltic Fleet. Widely regarded as the most able of Russian admirals in World War I, Essen led the Baltic Fleet energetically during the first year of the war. His forces at the time consisted of four battleships, five cruisers, four light cruisers, 62 torpedo boats, 12 submarines and numerous smaller and specialised units. His superiors preferred a cautious defensive position in the Baltic Sea, forcing Essen to concentrate his forces in the Gulf of Finland to protect Petrograd, with older units in the Gulf of Riga, and effectively abandoning Liepāja to the Germans. Nevertheless, on 9 August 1914, Essen led part of his fleet towards Gotland with the intent to contain the Swedish navy and deliver a note of his own making which would have violated Swedish neutrality and may have brought Sweden into the war. He was ordered back before his plan could be executed. However, on 27 August 1914, he assigned Rurik and to commerce raiding operations in the Baltic. Although of little success, the mission went a long way towards maintaining morale within the Baltic Fleet. Essen died unexpectedly after a short bout of pneumonia in May 1915. He is buried in the Novodevichy Cemetery (Saint Petersburg). He was survived by his wife, Mary, and son Anthony (who was later killedEssen, Anthony Nikolayevich in action as commander of the submarine AG-14 on 24 October 1917), and two daughters who married naval officers. ==Awards and commemoration== * Golden Sword for Bravery (14 March 1904) * Order of St. George (4th class), (17 April 1905) * Order of the White Eagle with Swords (12 December 1914) The second ship of the of frigates is named to commemorate the admiral. ==NotesReferences== * * Spencer C.

Look ceased publication with its issue of October 19, 1971, the victim of a $5 million loss in revenues in 1970 (with television cutting deeply into its advertising revenues), a slack economy, and rising postal rates.

It is based on the teachings of the 14th century Indian guru Ravidass, revered as a Satguru by the Ravidassia community. Historically, Ravidassia represented a range of beliefs in the Indian subcontinent, with some devotees of Ravidass counting themselves as Ravidassia, but first formed in the early 20th-century in colonial British India.Paramjit Judge (2014), Mapping Social Exclusion in India: Caste, Religion and Borderlands, Cambridge University Press, , pages 179-182 The Ravidassia community began to take on more cohesion following 1947, and the establishment of successful Ravidassia communities in the diaspora. Estimates range between two to five million for the total number of Ravidassias. Ravidassias believe that Ravidas is their Guru (saint) whereas the Sikhs have traditionally considered him as one of many bhagats (holy person). Further, Ravidassias accept living sants of Ravidass Deras as Guru whereas the Sikhs do not, states Ronki Ram. A new Ravidassia religion was launched following an assassination attack on their visiting living Guru Sant Niranjan Dass and his deputy Ramanand Dass in 2009 in Vienna by Sikh militants. Ramanand Dass died from the attack, Niranjan Dass survived his injuries, while over a dozen attendees at the temple were also injured.Inflamed passions, Ajoy A Mahaprashasta (2009), Frontline (The Hindu), Volume 26, Issue 12, Quote: \\"The riots were sparked off by an attack on Sant Niranjan Dass, the head of the Jalandhar-based Dera Sachkhand, and his deputy Rama Nand on May 24 at the Shri Guru Ravidass Gurdwara in Vienna where they had gone to attend a religious function. A group of Sikhs militants armed with firearms and swords attacked them at the gurdwara, injuring both; Rama Nand later died. The Austrian police said the attack that left some 15 others injured “had clearly been planned”.\\" This triggered a decisive break of the Ravidassia group from the orthodox Sikh structure. Prior to their break from Sikhism, the Dera Bhallan revered and recited the Guru Granth Sahib of Sikhism in Dera Bhallan. However, following their split from mainstream Sikhism, the Dera Bhallan compiled their own holy book based exclusively on Ravidas's teachings, the Amritbani Guru Ravidass Ji, and these Dera Bhallan Ravidassia temples now use this book in place of the Guru Granth Sahib. ==Basis== Procession of Ravidassias in Bedford Guru Ravidas Ravidas was born on 15 January 1377 CE (Indian calendar Sunday Sukhal Falgin Parvithta 1433) to the Chamar community. His birthplace was a locality known as Seer Govardhan in the city of Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh state, India. The birthplace is now marked by the Shri Guru Ravidass Janam Asthan (Begampura), and is a major place of pilgrimage for the followers of Guru Ravidas today. Ravidassias believe that Ravidas died in Benares at the age of 151. ==Beliefs== Teachings of Ravidas represent an offshoot of the Bhakti movement of the fifteenth century, a religious renaissance in India. Ravidas taught the following principles: * The oneness, omnipresence and omnipotence of God. * The human soul is a particle of God. * The rejection of the notion that God cannot be met by lower castes. * To realize God, which is the goal of human life, man should concentrate on God during all rituals of life. * The only way of meeting with God (moksha) is to free the mind from duality. ==Membership== The Shri Guru Ravidas Mission states that the conditions on being a member of the community are: *That one who preaches Guru Ravidas's philosophy is a Ravidassia. *It is not a condition that one should have been born in the Ravidassia community to become or to be initiated as one. *To celebrate Shri Guru Ravidass Jayanti according to the Punjabi calendar, Sunday, Sukhal Falgin Parvithta. ==Objectives== Dera Sach Khand Ballan of Jallandhar, Punjab on 30 January 2010 at the 633rd birth anniversary of Ravidas announced the objectives of Ravidassia religion as, \\"to propagate the Bani and teachings of Satguru Ravidass. Besides, the teachings and thought of Maharishi Bhagwan Balmiki, Satguru Namdev, Satguru Kabir, Satguru Trilochan, Satguru Sain and Satguru Sadna would also be propagated\\". ==Places of worship== The idol of Ravidas in the sanctum of Shri Guru Ravidas Janmsthan Mandir in Varanasi, marking his birthplace. A Ravidassia place of worship is called a dera, sabha, mandir, gurudwara, or bhawan, sometimes translated as temple.http://www.gururavidas.org.uk/ point 15: # To address our place of worship as Ravidassia Temple’ all the time and for all the purposes. It is considered respectful towards Guru Ravidas and generally mandatory to cover one's head and take off one's shoes while entering the place of worship. Outside the sabha there is always a flag upon which is written the Nishaan, and above it the \\"Harr\\" symbol which symbolising enlightenment from Guru Ravidas' teachings. Langar takes place inside the sabha continuously as a practice, and all are free to partake of it. In some Ravidassia sabhas the Guru Granth Sahib is still installed as the focal point in the main worship room. The Guru Granth Sahib is respected at all times. However most Ravidassia sabhas have replaced it with the new holy book, the Guru Ravidass Amrit Bani. Aarti and kirtan of all saints and gurus takes place daily at the closing of the day's formal services, this consists of the famous arti written by Guru Ravidas in which he tells God is one and equality is among all in the eyes of God. Some saints which Ravidassias refer to during the end of every prayer is Satguru Kabir, Satguru Sain, Satguru Sadhna, Satguru Trilochan, Meera Bai, Baba Farid and Bhagwan Valmik. ==Scriptures== Ravidassia places of worship contain the holy book Amritbani Guru Ravidass Ji which contains all the hymns by Guru Ravidas. This book contains the following hymns: Raga – Siri (1), Gauri (5), Asa (6), Gujari (1), Sorath (7), Dhanasari (3), Jaitsari (1), Suhi (3), Bilaval (2), Gaund (2), Ramkali (1), Maru (2), Kedara (1), Bhairau (1), Basant (1), and Malhar (3). The book contains 140 shabads, 40 pade, and 231 salok. There are 177 pages in all of the book. A version of the holy book Amrit Bani containing 240 hymns of Guru Ravidas was installed at the Guru Ravidas temple in Jalandhar, Punjab, on 1 February 2012 on the occasion of birth anniversary of Guru Ravidass. The Dera Sach Khand Ballan religious community had announced the formation of the new Ravidassia religion and separation from Sikhism at Varanasi. The split from Sikhism was triggered after the killing of its deputy head Ramanand Dass in May 2009 at a temple in Vienna by some Sikh radicals. President of newly formed Begumpura Lok Party and a supporter of the new religion, Satish Bharti, said that the copies of the new Bani were put on display during the religious processions in order to assert that the community members are firm believers of the new religion. ==Leaders== Ravidassias are aligned with a sant who mentors them on their spiritual path, providing personalised mantras and advice. The head of the Ravidassia Dharam, known as the sadhus are present mainly in Punjab and the Dera Sach Khand Ballan consists of sadhus, also known as Sant Samaj who in turn lead and are heads of all Ravidassias deras around the world. The leader of the Ravidassia religion, known as the Gaddi Nashin is Sant Niranjan Dass and former leaders include Sant Hari Dass, Sant Sarwan Dass, Sant Garib Dass and Sant Baba Pippal Dass. ==Customs== The Ravidassia employ the greeting \\"ਜੈ ਗੁਰੂਦੇਵ\\" (Jai Gurdev, जय गुरुदेव), meaning “hail the god-like teacher”, the motto of the religion. == Symbols == Nishan Sahib The Ravidassia religious symbol is known as the Harr Nishaan (\\"sign of God\\"). The Gurmukhi transliteration of the name Harr is the main symbol of the Ravidassia religion. It is also called as Koumi Nishan. The religion is also represented by a flag, with the insignia \\"Har\\" which, states Ronki Ram, includes: * A bigger circle with 40 rays of sunlight signifying forty hymns of Guru Ravidas; * Inside the big circle is a small circle, inside which is written \\"Har\\" in Gurmukhi language (ਹਰਿ) with a flame on top of it; * The flame represents the Naam (word) that would illuminate the entire world, and reaches the outer circle; * Between the two circles is written a couplet composed by Ravidas: ਨਾਮ ਤੇਰੇ ਕਿ ਜੋਤੀ ਲਗਾਈ, ਭੇਈਓ ਓ ਭਵਣ ਸਗਲਈ (Naam tere kee jot lagayi, Bhaio Ujiaaro Bhawan saglaare, \\"Your Name is the flame I light; it has illuminated the entire world\\") The insignia Har, states Ram, represents the \\"very being of Ravidass and his teachings\\". It is chosen after the name of their Guru, as ravi means \\"illumination\\" and dass \\"servant of god\\". ==Relationship with Sikhism== Festival of Shri Guru Ravidass at Arzignano, Italy Dera Bhallan Ravidasis claim that their religion was created after they were excluded from Sikh gurdwaras in Punjab. There are many similarities with mainstream Sikhism and indeed temple worship is similar. The primary difference is the reverence of Ravidas as their main Guru, and the use of Ravidas teachings as the primary scripture and their spiritual Satguru in contrast to Guru Granth Sahib being the scripture and Satguru of the Sikhs. Some Ravidassias also accept images and idols of Ravidas in their temples. ==Festival== Devotees at 635th Anniversary of Guru Ravidas at Sri Guru Ravidass Janamsthan Mandir, Varanasi The birthday of Ravidas is celebrated every year at the Seer Gowardhanpur village temple in Varanasi the state of Uttar Pradesh in January or February and the government of India has declared it a gazetted holiday. Every year more than 1 million devotees from India and abroad visit the Seer Goverdhanpur temple. In India, devotees pour in from Punjab, Haryana, Gujarat, MP, Bihar, UP and Uttarakhand while foreign devotees from the US, Canada and UK throng the village. On the day there is a Path of Amritbani Guru Ravidas read, the Harr Nishaan Sahib is changed ceremonially, and there is a special Ravidassia Arti and a Nagar Kirtan procession bearing Shri Guru Ravidas' portrait to the accompaniment of music through the streets of the temple locality. Special pilgrim trains been run to and from Varanasi for the last 12 years on the occasion of Parkash Ustav of Guru Ravi Dass. A special train is run from Jalandhar to Varanasi and back every year on Guru Ravidass Jyanti Purb for the convenience of the pilgrims since 2000. ==See also== * Dera Sach Khand * Sant Mat * List of Ravidassia people * Bhakti movement * Ramdasia Sikhs ==ReferencesExternal links== * Dera Sach khand Ballan Website * Guru Ravidas Guruji.com Category:Bhakti movement Category:Dalit communities Category:Sikhism Category:Indian religions Category:Social groups of Punjab, India Category:Weaving communities of South Asia Category:Sikh groups and sects ","title":"Ravidassia religion"},{"id":"5557798","text":"Yohanna Logan (born January 15, 1975) is an American fashion designer.

Stessel participated in the Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878). He subsequently commanded the 16th Ladoga Infantry Regiment in 1897, and then from 1897 to 1899 the 44th Kamchatka Infantry Regiment. He was appointed to head the 3rd East Siberian Brigade (1899–1903), and distinguished himself for his role in the suppression of the Boxer Movement of 1899-1901 in Qing China, being wounded in combat during the Battle of Tientsin in July 1900. He was subsequently awarded the Order of St. George (4th degree).Kowner, Historical Dictionary of the Russo-Japanese War, p. 359-360. From August 12, 1903, Stessel commanded the Russian garrison of Port Arthur in Manchuria - a total of over 50,000 men. Imperial Russia had occupied Port Arthur from 1897, and had heavily enhanced and modernized its defenses in the intervening years - its position was considered one of the most heavily fortified in the world. The Russo-Japanese War of 1904-1905 started in February 1904; Stessel was promoted to governor of the Kwantung Military District in March 1904, and Lieutenant General Konstantin Smirnov was appointed as his successor at Port Arthur. However, Stessel chose to interpret the orders to mean that Smirnov was his subordinate, and remained at Port Arthur, countermanding Smirnov's orders and denying his requests for supplies and reinforcements, and sending misleading telegrams to the Tsar blaming Smirnov for any setbacks. He also ignored orders from General Aleksei Kuropatkin (the commander-in-chief of the Russian land forces in Manchuria) to leave Port Arthur on a destroyer on July 3, 1904. Stessel's command of the Port Arthur defenses was ineffective throughout the Siege of Port Arthur (July 1904 to January 1905). In August 1904, after the Japanese victory at the Battle of Nanshan in May 1904, Stessel refused Japanese offers to evacuate the women and non-combatants from Port Arthur, and by autumn food was in short supply. Nogi (center left), Stoessel (center right) and their staffs Following the death of General Roman Kondratenko on December 15, 1904, at Fort Chikuan, Stessel appointed the incompetent Alexander Fok in his place. On December 18, 1904, the Japanese exploded an 1800-kilogram mine under Fort Chikuan (東鶏冠山北堡塁 in Japanese), which fell that night. On December 28, 1904, mines under Fort Erhlung were detonated, destroying that fort as well. On December 31, 1904, a series of mines were exploded under Fort Sungshu, Port Arthur's sole surviving major fortress, which surrendered that day. On January 1, 1905, Wantai finally fell to the Japanese. On the same day, Stessel and Fok sent a message to a surprised Japanese General Nogi Maresuke, offering to surrender. None of the other senior Russian staff had been consulted, and many were outraged. General Nogi accepted the offer of surrender, and the two sides signed a ceasefire agreement on January 2, 1905, at Shuishiying. After occupying the city, the Japanese were surprised to find large stores of food and ammunition; the Japanese, along with some of the Russian officials, believed Stessel had surrendered prematurely. While Japan interned the surviving men and officers of the Russian garrison at Port Arthur as prisoners-of-war, it allowed Stessel to return to St. Petersburg in comfortable quarters on a British passenger- liner. However, Stessel was discharged from the Imperial Russian Army on September 30, 1906, and was soon arrested (with several other members of the Russian military) and faced court-martial charges for cowardice and for surrendering Port Arthur to the Japanese. After a year of deliberations, he was sentenced to death on February 7, 1908. This sentence was later commuted to ten years imprisonment. On May 6, 1909 Emperor Nicholas II pardoned Stessel, Herman Bernstein in the New York Times, 15 August 1909 - \\"[... the 'hero' of Port Arthur, Gen.

Earlier in its life, the object is a protostar that grows by acquiring mass from its surrounding envelope of interstellar dust and gas. After the protostar blows away this envelope, it is optically visible, and appears on the stellar birthline in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram. At this point, the star has acquired nearly all of its mass but has not yet started hydrogen burning (i.e. nuclear fusion of hydrogen). The star then contracts, its internal temperature rising until it begins hydrogen burning on the zero age main sequence. This period of contraction is the pre-main sequence stage. An observed PMS object can either be a T Tauri star, if it has fewer than 2 solar masses (), or else a Herbig Ae/Be star, if it has 2 to 8 . Yet more massive stars have no pre- main-sequence stage because they contract too quickly as protostars. By the time they become visible, the hydrogen in their centers is already fusing and they are main-sequence objects. The energy source of PMS objects is gravitational contraction, as opposed to hydrogen burning in main-sequence stars. In the Hertzsprung–Russell diagram, pre-main-sequence stars with more than 0.5 first move vertically downward along Hayashi tracks, then leftward and horizontally along Henyey tracks, until they finally halt at the main sequence. Pre-main-sequence stars with less than 0.5 contract vertically along the Hayashi track for their entire evolution. PMS stars can be differentiated empirically from main-sequence stars by using stellar spectra to measure their surface gravity. A PMS object has a larger radius than a main-sequence star with the same stellar mass and thus has a lower surface gravity. Although they are optically visible, PMS objects are rare relative to those on the main sequence, because their contraction lasts for only 1 percent of the time required for hydrogen fusion. During the early portion of the PMS stage, most stars have circumstellar disks, which are the sites of planet formation. ==See also== * Protoplanetary disk * Protostar * Stellar birthline * Stellar evolution * Young stellar object ==References== Category:Star types Category:Star formation Category:Hertzsprung–Russell classifications ","title":"Pre-main-sequence star"},{"id":"5557861","text":"1851 in Australia was a watershed year.

The Gripenberg Family was granted nobility in the Swedish Empire in 1678 The Gripenberg Family was indrotuced into the Finnish noble house in 1866. His brother, Carl was an admiral in the Imperial Navy. Oskar Ferdinand Gripenberg married Hedvig Ida Angelique Lundh in 1874. They had four children. Early career Gripenberg began his military career in 1854 as a cadet in the ranks of the Russian Crimean Army. His first combat experience in the Crimean War against the British and the French, and he was named in dispatches for bravery on 2 November 1855. As part of the Russian force which suppressed the Polish uprising in 1863-1864 he was promoted to lieutenant. He was subsequently assigned to the Turkestan Military District, where he was assigned to command a line battalion of infantry from Orenburg and was promoted to major in 1866. He then commanded the 5th Turkestan Battalion, participating in numerous battles in the Turkestan War, including the conquest of the Emirate of Bukhara and the storming of the fortress of Ura-Tube. For these campaigns, he was awarded the Order of St. Anne (3rd Class with Swords and Bow) and the highly prestigious Order of St. George (4th degree), and was promoted to lieutenant-colonel. This was an unusual distinction as the award was normally only given to officers of at least general's rank. Gripenberg was further awarded the Order of St. Stanislav (2nd class) and Golden Sword of St. George with the inscription \\"For Bravery\\" in 1869. He was made commander of the 17th Infantry Battalion in 1872 and promoted to colonel. In 1877 he became commander of the 2nd Infantry Battalion of the elite Imperial Russian Life- Guards. He saw combat again during the Russo-Turkish War of 1877–1878, where he was awarded the Order of St. Vladimir (3rd degree with Swords), Order of St. Stanislaus (1st degree), and Order of St George (3rd degree) in 1877, and promotion to major general on 22 February 1878. In 1890 Gripenberg became commander of the prestigious First Division of the Moscow Life Guards and was promoted to lieutenant general. He lost this position in 1898 after criticizing heavy-handed Russian actions in Finland. He was eventually promoted to general of infantry in 1902, reassigned to command the Russian 6th Army Corps in 1900, and in 1904 was honored with the title aide-de-camp to Nicholas II.Kowner, Historical Dictionary of the Russo-Japanese War, p. 135. Russo-Japanese War Gripenberg was assigned to command the Russian 2nd Manchurian Army during Russo-Japanese War, arriving at Mukden on 28 November 1904. Gripenberg was extremely critical of the war of attrition tactics adopted by commander-in-chief General Aleksey Kuropatkin, who had hoped to draw the Imperial Japanese Army deep into Manchuria, where its supply lines would be overextended as part of a delaying tactic until the completion of the Trans-Siberian Railway would bring overwhelming Russian reinforcements. On arriving in Mukden, Gripenberg repeatedly told his men that anyone retreating from their position in the upcoming campaign would be shot. During the ensuing Battle of Sandepu in January 1905, Gripenberg perceived a weakness in the Japanese lines and launched a surprise assault that threw the enemy's left flank into disarray. However, Kuropatkin refused to commit troops to support his offensive, directly leading to the Russian defeat. Relations between the two officers had been strained from the beginning and Gripenberg asked to be relieved of his command of the 2nd Manchurian Army on 29 January 1905, only a day after the battle ended. Tsar Nicholas II allowed Gripenberg to return to Saint Petersburg immediately, although he was not formally relieved until March. Gripenberg lost no time in publicly blaming Kuropatkin for Russia's defeats, which sparked a war of words between the two men in the press. Final career Nicholas II still thought highly of Gripenberg, and on 30 April 1905 appointed him Inspector General of the Infantry on 28 June 1905, and as a member of the State Council. As Inspector General, he developed a new manual for shooting, but on 23 March 1906, frustrated by health, he resigned from active service, but remained on the State Councilor nominally as General- Adjutant. He spent his final days in continuing his campaign against Kuropatkin in the newspapers, pamphlets and books, blaming him for the Russian defeat at the Battle of Mukden and for the loss of the war in general. He died on 25 December 1915 in Petrograd and was buried in the Tsarskoselsky Cemetery. ==Honors== *link=Order of St. George Order of St. George, 4th class, 1867 *link=Order of St. Anna Order of St. Anne 1st degree, 1867 *link=Order of St. Stanislav Order of St. Stanislaus 2nd degree, 1867 *Gold Sword for Bravery (1869) * Montenegrin Medal (1878) *link=Order of St. George Order of St. George, 3rd class, 1878 *link=Order of St. Vladimir Order of St Vladimir, 3rd degree, 1878 *link=Order of St. Stanislav Order of St. Stanislaus 1st degree 1878. *Order of the Crown Order of the Crown, with star (Prussia), 1878 *link=Order of St. Anna Order of St. Anne 1st degree 1881 *link= Order of the Crown of Italy Order of the Crown of Italy, Officer's Cross 1882 (Italy) *link=Order of St. Vladimir Order of St Vladimir, 2nd degree, 1888 *link=Order of the White Eagle (Poland) Order of the White Eagle, 1896 *link= Order of St. Alexander Nevsky, Order of St. Alexander Nevsky, 1905 ==References== *Connaughton, R.M (1988).

The pub is the oldest licensed hotel in Balmain and one of a number of establishments which formed an integral part of the shipbuilding and industrial heritage of the local area. ==History== The origins of the Dry Dock Hotel can be traced to the Dock Inn located at 4 Thames Street between 1857 and 1861. From here, the pub moved to 42-44 Mort Street between 1865 and 1866. The land on which the pub currently stands was part of a much larger grant to colonial surgeon Dr William Balmain made in 1800 by Governor John Hunter. The licensee Thomas Wakfer, purchased the property on the current site from James McCallum in 1867 for the sum of A₤295. By the mid-1860s, nearby Mort's Dock was undertaking heavy industrialisation of its site in Balmain and was a generator of much housing and employment in the local area. It was from this enterprise that the pub owes much of its early history through the provision of both refreshment and accommodation for dock workers. The main gate for the dock was located only a short distance away at the opposite side of Cameron Street. The hotel was briefly known as The Clarendon in the early 1870s but then reverted to the Dock Inn until 1874, when it was renamed the Dry Dock Hotel. Mort's Dock continued to provide patrons for the Dry Dock until 1957 when rising costs, labour disputes and management problems forced it into liquidation. The hotel was one of the first to open a beer garden on the location of the current restaurant. Betty \\"Bottles\\" Holloway publican from 1979–82, was one of the first to introduce live music to pubs in the local area. ==Architecture== The pub is a two storey, rendered masonry building that is listed on the Inner West Council local government heritage register of architectural significance. Like most Balmain pubs, the building has gone through a number of structural changes, the most dramatic of which was the removal of the verandah as part of modernisation in the 1920s. The current facade dates from the 1930s. ==See also== * List of public houses in Australia ==References== * Nicholls, D; Baglin, D; Clarke, G; Around Balmain, The Balmain Association, 1986, . * Reynolds, P; Origins and Changes - Mort's Dock, Architectural History Research Unit, University of New South Wales, May 1985. * Solling, M; Reynolds, P; Leichhardt: On the margins of the city, Allen & Unwin, 1997, .

His father was captain of the steamship Jardine, the first steamship to travel from Britain to China in 1835. His parents married in Dundee in 1846 and also had three daughters, Margaret (born 1847 in China), Elizabeth (born 1848) and Charlotte (born 1850). Greig attended Brighton College between 1866 and 1868, and also Farningham School. ==Football career== Greig, who had also played for Hertfordshire Rangers, was recruited by the Wanderers to take the place of the retiring England goalkeeper Alexander Morten. He had impressed the Wanderers with his performance during the club's 16–0 demolition of Farningham in an 1874 FA Cup first round tie, and went on to represent his new team in the same competition in 1875–76. Wanderers won the 1876 cup final, defeating Old Etonians F.C. 3–0, making Greig the only goalkeeper in FA Cup history to progress from conceding sixteen goals in a first round tie one year to winning the competition a year later. Greig played 23 times for Wanderers, scoring twice in a rare appearance as an outfield player in 1874, and also turned out for London in two representative matches played against Sheffield. ==Later career== Little is known about Greig's professional life or his career after the 1876 FA Cup Final. He is recorded in the 1901 census as living at Coptfold Hall, Margaretting in Essex with his widowed sister, Elizabeth O. Jupp and her family. His profession was left blank.

The kernel of the SPK's ideological program is summated in the slogan, \\"Turn illness into a weapon\\", which is representative of an ethos that is continually and actively practiced under the new title, Patients' Front/Socialist Patients' Collective, PF/SPK(H). The first collective, SPK, declared its self-dissolution in July 1971 as a strategic withdrawal but in 1973 Huber proclaimed the continuity of SPK as Patients' Front. The SPK assumes that illness exists as an undeniable fact and believe that it is caused by the capitalist system. The SPK promotes illness as the protest against capitalism and considers illness as the foundation on which to create the human species. The SPK is opposed to doctors, considering them to be the ruling class of capitalism and responsible for poisoning the human species. The most widely recognized text of the PF/SPK(H) is the communique, SPK – Turn illness into a weapon, which has prefaces by both the founder of the SPK, Wolfgang Huber, and Jean-Paul Sartre. Rejecting the roles and ideology associated with the notion of the revolutionary as scientific explainer, they stated in Turn Illness Into a Weapon that whoever claims they want to \\"observe the bare facts dispassionately\\" is either an \\"idiot\\" or a \\"dangerous criminal.\\" ==History== The group was founded by Wolfgang Huber and became publicly known in 1970 at the psychiatric hospital of the University of Heidelberg. The SPK established a \\"free space\\" for \\"political therapy\\", re- framing illness as a contradiction created by capitalism which could be embraced to bring an end to the system which gave it life. They believed that the sick formed a revolutionary class of dispossessed people who could be radicalized to struggle against oppression. Organizing by sickness instead of socio-economic class allowed middle-class student leftists to articulate their own feelings of psychic and political oppression and to struggle against the status quo in their own right in solidarity with other oppressed groups. Additionally, according to the SPK sickness had the advantage of being familiar to everyone, hence everyone was a potential revolutionary so long as they disavowed the medical establishment. Like other anti-psychiatry experiments, such as Kingsley Hall and Villa 21, SPK questioned the patient/doctor paradigm and ultimately called for an overthrow of the \\"doctor's class\\". The SPK collective produced information leaflets, held teach-ins and Heidelberg University studied to recognize SPK as a part of the University.English Google translation: \\"Turn Illness into a Weapon,\\". Original German text: \\"Aus der Krankheit eine Waffe machen!,\\" Ruprecht (Heidelberger Studierenzeitung), Number 35 (16 May 1995). SPK conducted \\"agitations\\", called \\"single\\" (individual actions) and \\"group agitations\\" (collective actions), working from 9 am to 10 pm or later. However, the SPK experiment was criticized by many within Heidelberg's university and psychiatric clinic and the SPK's funding, salaries and meeting space were threatened. Despite opposition to the SPK, in the autumn of 1970 the university convened an advisory panel of 3 experts who recommended that the SPK should be institutionalized in Heidelberg university. To counter this suggestion, Heidelberg university's faculty of medicine supported the establishment of a counter-panel consisting of 3 critics of the SPK who were mandated to campaign against the group. The Minister overseeing both panels ultimately sided with the 3 SPK critics and decided against implementing any of the recommendations from the pro-SPK panel. SPK's funding was subsequently cut and the group was evicted from the university campus. The decision provoked a confrontation between the SPK and the university, which led to a sit-in and attracted the attention of a wider audience, including the police, in a climate of hypervigilance brought about by radical left-wing extrajudicial actions. Ultimately, the collective moved out of the university and into the homes of its members. On 24 June 1971, a mysterious shooting at Heidelberg police station was attributed to the Baader-Meinhof group, and based on that unrelated pretext, the police began conducting raids on SPK members' houses. Three hundred fifty officers were charged with finding the shooter. At its peak, the SPK counted about 500 members; of these, seven were arrested in the raids, including Huber on 21 July 1971. Firstly SPK was falsely linked to the Baader-Meinhof group but none of the SPK patients arrested was ever condemned due to any relation with the Baader-Meinhof group and neither was ever proved any relation within SPK and RAF. Accounts notice the brutality, legal irregularities and other sort of abuses which surrounded the case, and they also notice this was part of a disinformation campaign against SPK due to their revolutionary positions, and thus SPK was criminalized as part of a political persecution. The rhetoric denouncing the SPK as engaged in \\"terrorist activity\\" and a precursor to the RAF re-emerged after the arrest of Kristina Berster, who crossed the US border illegally seeking asylum from West German counterterrorism operations. Berster was acquitted of all conspiracy charges, and the disinformation campaign was exposed by Greg Guma. A West German embassy spokesman stated, \\"By all accounts the SPC was fairly harmless.\\"Connie Paige \\"Vermont Town in Uproar over Baader-Meinhof Terrorist Who Wasn’t,\\" The Boston Phoenix (30 Sep 1978). Kristina Berster explained that \\"the purpose of the Socialist Patients Collective was to find out the reasons why people feel lonely, isolated and depressed and the circumstances which caused these problems.\\" ==Dissolution and the IZRU== Even before Huber was arrested in June 1971In 1971 Wolfgang and Ursul Huber were sentenced to 4.5 years imprisonment, and released in 1976. During their detention, in the infamous Stammheim Prison, they participated in a solidarity hunger strike., the SPK dissolved. The IZRU or Information Zentrum Rote Volks-Universität (in English; Information Center of the Red People's University) was founded by former SPK members; however, the IZRU was neither the official or unofficial SPK. It organized international congresses, founded a newspaper: RVU (or Rote Volksuniversität, People's Red University), supported prisoners and reprinted some SPK literature. ==The SPK today== Since 1973, the SPK has continued as Patients' Front/Socialist Patients' Collective, or PF/SPK(H). The refounding of the collective as Patient's Front was announced by Huber whilst he was in solitary confinement in Stammheim Prison, later called PF/SPK(H). As the founder of the SPK and PF/SPK(H), Huber entrusted all juridical matters concerning the groups to Ingeborg Muhler, an active member of the SPK since 1970, who is an attorney and holds a MA in Computer Science. ==Interest and influence== Discussion of the SPK in both German-language and English-language written sources increased during the 1970s, fell during the 1980s, and rose again during the 1990s Google Books Ngram Viewer \\"Socialist Patients' Collective\\" Google Books Ngram Viewer \\"Sozialistisches Patientenkollektiv\\".

Stationed with the 75th Infantry Regiment at Sevastopol, his first combat experience was against the mountain tribes of the western Caucasus Mountains. He made a name for himself in the Russo-Turkish War (1877-1878), and was appointed commander of the South Ussuri Division in 1895. During the Boxer Rebellion, Linevich was commander of the 1st Siberian Army Corps. He participated in the Battle of Peking in 1900.Kowner, Historical Dictionary of the Russo-Japanese War, p. 210-211. In 1903, he was appointed commander of the Priamur Region as Governor-General of Dauria. At the outbreak of the Russo-Japanese War, Linevich was temporarily in charge of the Russian Manchurian Army until the arrival of General Aleksey Kuropatkin on March 15, 1904. He was again placed in command of the First Manchurian Army from October 1904 to March 3, 1905. After the Russian defeat at the Battle of Mukden, General Kuropatkin was relieved of his command, and Linevich was promoted to succeed him as commander in chief of the Russian armies in the Far East. However, once promoted, Linevich procrastinated, irking Tsar Nicholas II with never-ending demands for reinforcements, insisting that he had to have a 1.5:1 numerical superiority before he would be able to go on the offensive against the Japanese positions. He opposed peace negotiations with Japan, advising Tsar Nicholas that victory on land was certain once the requisite reinforcements arrived. After the Treaty of Portsmouth ended the war, Linevich oversaw the evacuation of Russian forces from Manchuria, hampered by strikes and revolutionary agitation by the railroad workers. He refused to take action against the workers, and when a portion of his troops revolted as part of the Russian Revolution of 1905, he was in no hurry to put down the risings. As a result, he was relieved of his duties in February 1906. Linevich spent the rest of his life in retirement. His wartime journal (The Russian-Japanese War. From the diaries AN Kuropatkin and NP Linevich) was published posthumously in 1925. ==Honors== *link=Order of St. George Order of St. George, 3rd class, August 1900 *link=Order of St. George Order of St. George, 4th class *link=Order of St. Vladimir Order of St Vladimir, 3rd degree, *link=Order of St. Vladimir Order of St Vladimir, 4th degree *link=Order of St. Anna Order of St. Anne 3rd degree *link=Order of St. Stanislav Order of St. Stanislaus 3rd degree *link=Order of Leopold (Belgium) Order of Leopold, 1st degree (Belgium) *link=Order of the Rising Sun Order of the Rising Sun, 1st degree, (Japan) *link= Order of St. Andrew Order of St. Andrew ==References== *Connaughton, R.M (1988).

Barrie first got involved with radio while a student at Dartmouth, and after graduation he began a career in radio: WCCC-FM in Hartford, Connecticut, WAYE in Baltimore and WASH-FM, then a Metromedia station in Washington, DC. Given Conscientious Objector status by his local draft board during the Vietnam War, Barrie trained as a combat medic. In 1969, he received orders to be shipped to Vietnam. A conversation with his brother, a career officer who had just returned from two years there, confirmed Barrie's decision to desert and leave the U.S. for Canada. He later received a general discharge from the United States Army, became a Canadian citizen, and is free to travel to the U.S. ==Career in radio== Barrie was introduced to CJAD in Montreal, and when one of the station's long-time commentators resigned in protest during the October Crisis of 1970, Barrie was named as his replacement. In 1977, he moved to Toronto and a job at CFRB, where his commentaries won him an ACTRA award. He also worked briefly as an anchor and reporter for Global Television. In 1995, he was invited to join CBC Radio as the host of CBLA-FM's morning drive-time show, Metro Morning, in Toronto, Ontario, the talk and current affairs program that became the top-rated morning radio show in Toronto. On June 29, 2007 Barrie revealed to his listeners that he had been diagnosed with early-stage Parkinson's disease. Barrie said he intended to continue as a broadcaster for at least another three years. On February 1, 2010 he announced his retirement from Metro Morning. Barrie's last day as host was Thursday, February 25, 2010.\\"Andy Barrie to leave Metro Morning: exclusive interview\\". The Globe and Mail, February 1, 2010. He was succeeded by Matt Galloway. June 16, 2010, Barrie was awarded an Honorary Doctor of Laws degree by Toronto's York University. On December 30, 2012, it was announced that Barrie was admitted to the Order of Canada for his achievements in Canadian broadcasting, and for his advocacy on behalf of those living with Parkinson's disease. ==Personal life== Andy Barrie was married in 1970 to Dr. Mary Cone Barrie, who retired in 2005 as the director of the School of Continuing Studies at the University of Toronto. Their daughter Jessie also has a doctorate in educational leadership and is the head of Bosque School, an independent school for students in grades 6-12, in Albuquerque, New Mexico. Mary Cone Barrie died on February 18, 2009. Barrie took a leave of absence from the CBC from November 2008 to March 2009 to care for her during her illness. ==References External links == *Former Metro Morning host Andy Barrie battles Parkinson’s with brain surgery, Toronto Star, September 2014 *Andy Barrie: The Voice - documentary by Lana Šlezić Category:Living people Category:1945 births Category:American emigrants to Canada Category:Canadian radio reporters and correspondents Category:American conscientious objectors Category:Dartmouth College alumni Category:Dartmouth College alumni missing graduation year Category:Radio personalities from Baltimore Category:People from Yonkers, New York Category:Canadian television reporters and correspondents Category:Canadian talk radio hosts Category:CBC Radio hosts Category:Members of the Order of Canada Category:People with Parkinson's disease Category:Naturalized citizens of Canada ","title":"Andy Barrie"},{"id":"5557988","text":"Four ships and a shore establishment of the Royal Navy have borne the name HMS Boadicea after Boadicea, queen of the Iceni in Roman Britain, whilst another ship was planned but never completed: * was a 38-gun fifth rate launched in 1797.

While at Dickinson he was a member of Kappa Sigma Fraternity, as well as Omicron Delta Kappa, Tau Kappa Alpha and Tau Delta Kappa.

His nickname while in college, spawned by his seriousness, was ironically, in light of later events, \\"The Bishop.\\" Fred went on to study at Drew Theological Seminary, Madison, New Jersey, earning a Bachelor of Divinity degree in 1920. He received an M.A. degree from Dickinson also in 1920. He received an honorary D.D. degree from Syracuse University in 1933. ==Ordained Ministry== Fred entered the ministry of the New York East Annual Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church. He was ordained in 1919 and was appointed to pastorates on Long Island, New York; in New Haven, Connecticut; and in Brooklyn, New York. He was appointed a District Superintendent in 1929. ==Presidency of Dickinson College== The Rev. Dr. Corson was elected the twentieth President of Dickinson College 8 June 1934. He had no previous experience in academic administration. In light of this, he often relied on the President of the Board of Trustees, Boyd Lee Spahr. Corson also operated in a firm and hierarchical fashion in relations with the faculty. Nevertheless, during his decade of presidency, in often difficult times (e.g., during The Great Depression and World War II), Corson gained respect for his careful financial stewardship. He also reintroduced some of the reforms in services and curriculum his predecessor, Karl Waugh, had proposed. For example, in 1936 he established a student health services program. He reinstated the policy of departmental honors with the requirement of a thesis. During the War, Corson worked hard to maintain enrollment, and was instrumental in Dickinson being chosen in 1943 as the site of a U.S. Army Air Force Aircrew Training Program, a move which helped ensure the fiscal health of the institution during the crisis of war. ==Episcopal Ministry== The Rev. Dr. Corson was elected Bishop by the 1944 Northeastern Jurisdictional Conference of The Methodist Church. He was assigned the Philadelphia episcopal area, where he served until his retirement in 1968. This election, of course, necessitated his resignation from the Presidency of Dickinson, a move which angered some and reopened old wounds concerning the College's relationship with the Methodist denomination. By all accounts, Bishop Corson led a sterling career as an Episcopal Leader. He was elected President of the Council of Bishops in 1952.

The squadron is based at Marine Corps Air Station Miramar, California and falls under the command of Marine Aircraft Group 11 (MAG-11) and the 3rd Marine Aircraft Wing (3rd MAW). ==History== Marine Fighter Attack Training Squadron 101 (VMFAT-101), was commissioned at Marine Corps Air Station El Toro, California on January 3, 1969, as part of Marine Combat Crew Readiness Training Group 10, 3rd Marine Aircraft Wing. The squadron trained naval aviators and naval flight officers in the employment of the McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II. VMFAT-101 flew its first training sortie February 20, 1969, and completed its first class of fighter aircrew by August of that year. During the summer of 1970, VMFAT-101 moved to Marine Corps Air Station Yuma, Arizona. In 1972 the Sharpshooters earned their first Chief of Naval Operations CNO Aviation Safety Award for Excellence in aviation safety after compiling over 18,300 mishap free flight hours. In July 1974, VMFAT-101 absorbed the assets of VMFAT-201 from Marine Corps Air Station Cherry Point, North Carolina and became the largest fixed wing tactical jet squadron and the sole remaining F-4 training squadron in the Marine Corps. The Sharpshooters earned the 1976 CNO Aviation Safety Award, as well as the Commanding General Fleet Marine Forces Pacific Aviation Safety Award in 1978 and 1979 while it amassed over 30,000 mishap-free flight hours. The Sharpshooters continued to train aircrews in the venerable Phantom II and in 1983 earned the coveted Marine Corps Aviation Association Robert M. Hanson Award as the finest fighter squadron in Marine aviation. May 20, 1987, VMFAT-101 trained its last F-4 replacement aircrew; during July the squadron flew its remaining 10 F-4 aircraft to Davis-Monthan Air Force Base, Ariz., for permanent storage. During the 18 years VMFAT-101 flew the Phantom, the Sharpshooters amassed over 125,000 flight hours training Marine and Navy aircrews for the fleet. On September 29, 1987, VMFAT-101 returned to MCAS El Toro to beginning training as the Marine Corps’ dedicated F/A-18 Fleet Replacement Squadron (FRS). On March 31, 1988, MCCRTG-10 deactivated and VMFAT-101 joined Marine Aircraft Group 11. By October of that year, the Sharpshooters owned 21 F/A-18s, had trained 25 qualified instructor pilots and were ready to begin training new Hornet pilots. By May 1989 VMFAT-101 graduated 23 new F/A-18 pilots and accumulated over 11,000 mishap free Hornet flight hours. With three times the number of aircraft of a typical F/A-18 squadron, VMFAT-101 is capable of producing 40 replacement pilots (RPs) in addition to refreshing numerous former fleet aviators that are out of currency. Another important function that VMFAT-101 serves is the grooming of Marine Corps and Navy maintenance personnel. With such a large number of aircraft, there is also a very large number of people that earn critical maintenance qualifications and assume leadership positions while they are in the SharpShooters. The focus of flight training while at VMFAT-101 is oriented towards the tactical employment of the F/A-18 in various combat scenarios. Collectively referred to as replacement aircrew (RACs), these aviation officers undergo intense training that normally lasts 44 weeks and is broken into four distinct phases: Transition, Air-to-Ground, Air-to-Air, and Carrier Qualification. The first training phase is the Transition Phase, which is the shortest phase in duration and covers the most basic aircraft procedures, focusing primarily on Naval Air Training and Operating Procedures Standardization knowledge, aircraft combat systems, navigation, night flying, formation flying, and basic radar intercepts. After a student completes the Transition phase, they are comfortable flying the Hornet and operating all of its systems, as well as able to operate and navigate the F/A-18 in any weather, day or night. The second phase of training is the Air-to-Ground phase. Once the RACs have demonstrated sound aircraft systems knowledge, navigation, and formation flying, it is time to introduce tactical employment of the Hornet in combat scenarios. During the Strike Phase, the RACs practice basic dive bombing, low-altitude tactics, high-altitude target attacks, Joint Direct Attack Munitions employment, close air support and are introduced to night-vision goggle flight. During this phase, the RACs employ a variety of light and heavy inert ordnance, general-purpose bombs, high-explosive rockets and 20mm gun rounds. Additionally, the replacement WSOs are introduced to forward air controller airborne (FAC(A)) procedures. After completing the Strike Phase, the RACs move on to the dynamic and demanding Air-to-Air Phase. The aircrew begin the phase by learning how to fight the F/A-18 in the basic fighter maneuvers (BFM), i.e., “dog-fighting.” Using Marine Aviation Weapons and Tactics Squadron One (MAWTS-1) training tactics and procedures, fighter weapon instructors teach the RACs how to push the F/A-18 to the limits of its operating envelope. The final phase of the FRS syllabus is Carrier Qualification (CQ). The RPs undergo an intense period of field carrier landing practice. Their Instructor Landing Signals Officers (LSOs), will carefully monitor their progress every step of the way, while providing techniques and instruction throughout the entire process. The customers of the VMFAT-101 product are the eleven deployable fleet squadrons and all four Marine Aircraft Groups. Whether the aircrew will be serving in support of CENTCOM AOR requirements, launching off the carrier into combat within weeks of leaving the unit, or serving as part of the USMC Unit Deployment Program to Iwakuni, Japan, the SharpShooters ensure that every Replacement Aircrew they send off is mission-capable from day one. They will arrive ready to take an active role in combat missions, and eventually move on to assume leadership positions within the squadron in one to two years – potentially responsible for leading flights of 2 or 4 aircraft at a time. The future for VMFAT-101 is bright. Even as the Marine Corps slowly transitions toward the F-35 Lighting II, the F/A-18 Hornet will be supporting the Marine Air Ground Task Force through 2030. The VMFAT-101 SharpShooters continue to maintain a proud heritage from the Phantom II days and produce the highest-caliber combat-ready aircrew. At VMFAT-101 aviators have and will continue to learn the fundamentals that will set the baseline for their careers as naval officers and as aircrew. They will receive the highest level of training as tacticians in the air-to-air and the air-to- ground arenas, but most importantly, they will begin the process of learning what it takes to be a Marine officer in the Hornet community. ==See also== * United States Marine Corps Aviation * List of active United States Marine Corps aircraft squadrons * List of inactive United States Marine Corps aircraft squadrons ==References== : ==External links== * Category:Fighter attack squadrons of the United States Marine Corps Category:Training squadrons of the United States Marine Corps ","title":"VMFAT-101"},{"id":"5558029","text":"Philosophers (and others important in the history of philosophy), listed alphabetically: ::Note: This list has a minimal criteria for inclusion and the relevance to philosophy of some individuals on the list is disputed. ==D== * Jean le Rond d'Alembert, (1717–1783) * Damascius, (c. 462–540) * Peter Damian, (c. 1007–1072) * Hubert Damisch, (1928–2017) * Arthur Danto, (1924-2013) * Charles Darwin, (1809–1882) * Erasmus Darwin, (1731–1802) * David of Dinant, (12th century) * David the Invincible, (late 6th century) * Donald Davidson, (1917–2003) * Angela Davis, (born 1944) * Jalal al-Din al-Dawani, (1426–1502) * Simone de Beauvoir, (1908–1986) * Bruno de Finetti, (1906–1985) * Joseph de Maistre, (1753–1821) * Paul de Man, (1919–1983) * Augustus De Morgan, (1806–1871) * Francesco de Sanctis, (1817–1883) * Guy Debord, (1931–1994) * Régis Debray, (born 1940) * Richard Dedekind, (1831–1916) * Joseph Déjacque, (1821–1865) * Gilles Deleuze, (1925–1995) * Bernard Delfgaauw, (1912–1993) * Elijah Delmedigo, (1460–1497) * Giorgio Del Vecchio, (1878–1970) * Democritus, (460–370 BC) * Daniel Dennett, (born 1942) * Denys the Carthusian (or Denys de Leeuwis), (1402–1471) * Jacques Derrida, (1930–2004) * René Descartes, (1596–1650) * Vincent Descombes, (born 1943) * Robert Desgabets, (1610–1678) * Antoine Destutt de Tracy, (1754–1836) * Paul Deussen, (1845–1919) * Alejandro Deustua, (1849–1945) * John Dewey, (1859–1952) * Dharmakirti, (c. 7th century) * Albert Venn Dicey, (1835–1922) * Denis Diderot, (1713–1784) * Dietrich of Freiberg, (13th century) * Joseph Dietzgen, (1828–1888) * Kenelm Digby, (1603–1665) * Dignaga, (c. 480–c. 540) * Wilhelm Dilthey, (1833–1911) * Hugo Dingler, (1881–1954) * Diodorus Cronus, (3rd century BC) * Diogenes Laërtius, (3rd century) * Diogenes of Apollonia, (c. 460 BC) * Diogenes of Babylon, (c. 230 – c. 150/140 BC) * Diogenes of Oenoanda, (2nd century) * Diogenes the Cynic of Sinope, (412–323 BC) * Dogen Zenji (or Dōgen Kigen), (1200–1253) * Dong Zhongshu (or Tung Chung-shu), (c. 176–c. 104) * Herman Dooyeweerd, (1894–1977) * Fyodor Dostoyevsky, (1821–1881) * Frederick Douglass, (1818-1895) * Fred Dretske, (1932-2013) * Hans Adolf Eduard Driesch, (1867–1941) * W.

Sylvanius: The Gentleman's Magazine, 1855, p 303 Named Adelaide, or known as Adele in the family, she held the title of Archduchess of Austria. Her father was the Viceroy of Lombardy-Venetia and was a son of Leopold II, Holy Roman Emperor and Maria Louisa of Spain. Her mother was a member of the House of Savoy and a daughter of the Prince of Carignano, the head of the junior branch of the House of Savoy, who ruled the Kingdom of Sardinia. Her younger brother Archduke Rainer Ferdinand later acted as Minister President of Austria. Both of her brothers contracted morganatic marriages. Duchess of Savoy On 12 April 1842, at the Palazzina di Caccia di Stupinigi, she married Victor Emmanuel of Savoy. The marriage was used to cement relations between the House of Savoy and that of the House of Habsburg but was viewed by many people of the time to increase Austrian power in Italy.Georgina Sarah. Godkin:Life of Victor Emmanuel II, First king of Italy, Volume I, 1879, p 44 Victor Emmanuel was her first cousin and heir apparent to the King of Sardinia. He was styled the \\"Duke of Savoy\\" prior to succession. Adelaide thus took on the style of \\"Duchess of Savoy.\\" She maintained her style of Imperial and Royal Highness until she became Queen. Her husband's mother, Maria Theresa of Austria, retained great influence over her son throughout his life. Her mother-in-law was also her first cousin, both she and Adelaide being grandchildren of Emperor Leopold II. Adelaide and her husband of thirteen years had eight children. Four of these went on to have further progeny. Her husband had various extramarital affairs throughout the marriage.Forester. C.S: Victor Emmanuel II: And the Union of Italy, Simon Publications LLC, 2001, p 216 Adelaide was a quiet and pious woman and had a strict upbringing. She was a loving wife and frequently would give to charity.The eclectic magazine of foreign literature Volume 2; Volume 35, p 556 Queen of Sardinia In March 1849, her father-in-law King Charles Albert abdicated after the events of the Revolutions of 1848. Her husband succeeded as Victor Emmanuel II of Sardinia. During her tenure as queen consort, she had three further children, all of whom died in infancy. On 8 January 1855, she gave birth to a son who was styled the Count of Genevois. Days later, Queen Maria Theresa died on 12 January 1855. Adelaide went to the late queen's funeral on 16 January, and on returning to the palace caught a cold. She died four days later at the Royal Palace of Turin, having had an acute attack of Gastroenteritis. Another story says that Adelaide died of her burns after stepping on a match that set fire to her clothes. She is buried at the Royal Basilica of Superga. In 1861 her husband would become the first post-unification King of Italy. Her husband wed again to Rosa Vercellana in a morganatic marriage.Forester.

He was a contemporary of Muhammad. According to ibn Hisham (Kitab Sirat Rasul Allah, ed. Wüstenfeld, pp. 690, 713) and Abu al-Faraj al- Isfahani (\\"Kitab al-Aghani,\\" viii. 104), Jabal was a Tha'alabite (Abu al-Faraj gives the whole genealogy), but neither of them mentions the fact that he was a Jew. Ibn Hajar, however, in his biographical dictionary \\"Kitab al-Ashabah fi Tamyiz al-Shahabah\\" (ed. Sprenger, i. 453), relying on ibn al-Kalbi and on al- Marzabani, declares that such was the case and that Jabal subsequently embraced Islam. Yaqut (\\"Mu'jam,\\" i. 765), quoting a verse of Jabal, calls him erroneously \\"Jamal ibn Jawwal al-Taghlabi.\\" Jabal is sporadically cited by the above-mentioned Arabic authors. Abu al-Faraj (l.c. p. 101) quotes two verses of Jabal's, apparently from a poem which he addressed to al-Shammakh, himself a Tha'alabite poet, in reference to a quarrel that arose between them. This is probably the same incident as that related by Abu al-Faraj (l.c. p. 104); namely, that al-Shammakh fell in love with Jabal's sister Kalbah, and when, shortly afterward, al-Shammakh went on a journey she married his brother, giving rise to a poetical contest between the disappointed lover and Jabal. Eleven other verses by Jabal, indicating sufficiently the poet's Jewish religion, are quoted by ibn Hisham (l.c. p. 713). They are an elegy on the death of Huyayy ibn Akhtab (according to Sprenger's punctuation in ibn Hajar, l.c., \\"Jubayy\\"), chief of the Banu al-Nadir, and on the defeat by Muhammad of this tribe and of the Banu Qurayza. These verses were a reply to the poet Hassan ibn Thabit. They apparently do not form a complete poem; for ibn Hajar (l.c.) quotes a verse of Jabal's not appearing in the quotation of Ibn Hisham, but having the same meter and the same rhyme, and therefore probably from the same poem. ==See also== *Abu 'Afak *Ka'b ibn al-Ashraf ==Resources== Gottheil, Richard and M.

It is spread over an area of 4954 km². The wildlife sanctuary was established in 1972 and came under the Wildlife Protection Act of 1972. The sanctuary is one of the last places on earth where the endangered wild ass sub-species Indian Wild Ass (Khur) (Equus hemionus khur) belonging to Asiatic Wild Ass species Onager (Equus hemionus) can be spotted. ==Geography== The Rann of Kutch is a sealine desert. During monsoon, the Rann (Gujarati for desert) gets flooded for a period of about one month and is dotted with about 74 elevated plateaus or islands, locally called 'bets'. These bets are covered with grass and feed the population of around 2100 animals. ==Species found== The sanctuary is habitat to many species of animals and birds. According to the data submitted to the UNESCO World Heritage Centre the sanctuary has * About 93 species of invertebrates - 25 species of zooplanktons, 1 species of annelid, 4 crustaceans, 24 insects, 12 molluscs and 27 spiders. * 4 species of amphibians * 29 species of reptiles - 2 species of turtles, 14 species of lizards, 12 snakes and 1 crocodile * Metapenaeus kutchensis - a type of prawn * 70,000-75,000 bird nests * 9 mammalian orders with 33 species/subspecies - including the world’s last population of the Khur sub-species of the wild ass Pied bush chat in LRK ==Threats== The main threat faced by the sanctuary is the illegal salt panningThe salt-panners of the little Rann; kuensel online; Nov 16, 2009; asiaone news; Singapore Press Holdings activity in the area. 25% of India's salt supply comes from panning activity in the area. ==Biosphere Reserve - World Heritage Site== It is nominated by the Forest department to be a biosphere reserve which are areas of terrestrial and coastal ecosystems internationally recognized within the framework of UNESCO's Man and Biosphere (MAB) programme. it will focus on conserving biological diversity, research, monitoring and providing sustainable development models, the proposal has been sent to and listed at UNESCO.Kutch’s wild ass habitat may soon get heritage label (2 Page article online); by DP Bhattacharya; Jul 26, 2007; Indian Express Newspaper ==Wildlife Sanctuaries and Reserves of Kutch== From the city of Bhuj various ecologically rich and wildlife conservation areas of the Kutch / Kachchh district can be visited such as Indian Wild Ass Sanctuary, Kutch Desert Wildlife Sanctuary, Narayan Sarovar Sanctuary, Kutch Bustard Sanctuary, Banni Grasslands Reserve and Chari-Dhand Wetland Conservation Reserve etc.. ==Gallery== Image:Wild ass group female.jpgA group of female asses breaking into a run Image:Wild ass male.JPGAlpha Male of a group.

KIF is similar to frame languages such as KL-One and LOOM but unlike such language its primary role is not intended as a framework for the expression or use of knowledge but rather for the interchange of knowledge between systems. The designers of KIF likened it to PostScript. PostScript was not designed primarily as a language to store and manipulate documents but rather as an interchange format for systems and devices to share documents. In the same way KIF is meant to facilitate sharing of knowledge across different systems that use different languages, formalisms, platforms, etc. KIF has a declarative semantics. It is meant to describe facts about the world rather than processes or procedures. Knowledge can be described as objects, functions, relations, and rules. It is a formal language, i.e., it can express arbitrary statements in first order logic and can support reasoners that can prove the consistency of a set of KIF statements. KIF also supports non-monotonic reasoning. KIF was created by Michael Genesereth, Richard Fikes and others participating in the DARPA knowledge sharing Effort. Although the original KIF group intended to submit to a formal standards body, that did not occur. A later version called Common Logic has since been developed for submission to ISO and has been approved and published. A variant called SUO-KIF is the language in which the Suggested Upper Merged OntologySuggested Upper Merged Ontology. is written. A practical application of the Knowledge interchange format is an agent communication language in a multi-agent system. == See also == * Knowledge Query and Manipulation Language == References  External links == * Knowledge Interchange Format page at the Stanford AI Lab * Common Logic Category:Knowledge representation languages Category:Ontology (information science) Category:Logic in computer science ","title":"Knowledge Interchange Format"},{"id":"5558064","text":"Osakis can refer to a community in the United States: * Osakis, Minnesota * Osakis Township, Douglas County, Minnesota ","title":"Osakis"},{"id":"5558075","text":"Philosophers (and others important in the history of philosophy), listed alphabetically: ::Note: This list has a minimal criterion for inclusion and the relevance to philosophy of some individuals on the list is disputed. ==I== * Iamblichus, (ca. 245 AD-ca. 325) * Yahya ibn Adi, (893–974) * Ibn Arabi, (1164–1240) * Ibn ar-Rawandi, (c. 910) * Ibn Bajjah (or Avempace), (died 1138) * Ibn Daud (or Rabad I or Avendauth, or John of Spain), (1110–1180) * Abraham ibn Ezra, (1092/3–1167) * Moses ibn Ezra, (1070–1138) * Ibn Falaquera, (1223–1290) * Solomon Ibn Gabirol, (1021–1058) * Ibn Hazm, (994–1069) * Ibn Kammuna, (1215–1284) * Ibn Khaldun, (1332–1406) * Ibn Masarra, (883–931) * Ibn Miskawayh, (940–1030) * Bahya ibn Paquda, (1040–1110) * Ibn Sabin, (1217–1268) * Ibn Taymiya, (1263–1328) * Samuel ibn Tibbon, (c. 1165 – 1232) * Ibn Tufail, (1110–1185) * Joseph ibn Tzaddik, (c. 1149) * Ivan Aleksandrovich Il'in, (1883–1954) * Evald Vassilievich Ilyenkov, (1924–1979) * Immanuel the Roman, (c. 1270–c. 1330) * Roman Ingarden, (1893–1970) * William Ralph Inge, (1860–1954) * José Ingenieros, (1877–1925) * Nae Ionescu, (1890–1940) * Muhammad Iqbal, (1877–1938) * Luce Irigaray, (born 1930) * Terence Irwin, (born 1947) * Isocrates, (436–338 BC) * Isaac of Stella, (1105–1177) * Isaac Israeli, (c. 850–950) * Ito Jinsai, (1627–1705) * Vyacheslav Ivanovich Ivanov, (1866–1949) ==J== * Frank Jackson, (born 1943) * Friedrich Heinrich Jacobi, (1743–1819) * Franz Jakubowski, (1912–1970) * James of Viterbo, (1255–1308) * Henry James Sr., (1811–1882) * William James, (1842–1910) * Fredric Jameson, (born 1934) * Vladimir Jankélévitch, (1903–1985) * Karl Jaspers, (1883–1969) * Jayarāśi Bhaṭṭa, (fl. c. 800) * James Hopwood Jeans, (1877–1946) * Thomas Jefferson, (1743–1826) * Richard C.

He was born about the close of the third century, and died 337 CE. ==Biography== His father, Kaylil, was the brother of Rabbah bar Nachmani (Rabbah), a teacher at the Academy of Pumbedita. Abaye's real name was Nachmani, after his grandfather. Left an orphan at an early age, he was adopted by his uncle, Rabbah. Opinions differ as to the source of his nickname Abaye. Some say it is a diminutive of the word abba (father), meaning \\"Little Father\\", to avoid confusion with his grandfather of the same name (or perhaps to show respect for that grandfather).Tosafot Rosh, Ramah, end of Horayot Others say that Abaye was not a nickname, but an acronym of the Biblical phrase \\"For through You the orphan receives mercy\\", alluding to Abaye's being an orphan.Maharsha (on Kiddushin) based on Sefer Yuchasin; Arizal, Shaar haGilgulim A modern opinion is that Abaye is an old Aramaic word meaning \\"comfort\\", and thus a direct translation of his Hebrew name, Nachmani.Yaakov Reifman, Pesher Davar, p.8. Also brought in Toldot Tannaim veAmoraim, A, Abaye (bar Kaylil haKohen). From then on he was known as Abaye, without any other title. Abaye was a skilled juggler, and would entertain his uncle by juggling during Simchat Beit HaShoeivah celebrations. It is a curious fact that he perpetuated the memory of his foster-mother by mentioning her name in many popular recipes and dietetic precepts, some of which seem to be based on superstitious notions. He introduced each recipe with the phrase, \\"My mother told me.\\" Abaye's teachers were his uncle Rabbah and Rav Yosef bar Hiyya, both of whom successively became presidents of the Pumbedita Academy. When Rav Yosef died (324 CE), this dignity was conferred upon Abaye, who retained it until his death five years later. Rabbah trained him in the application of the dialectic method to halakhic problems, and Rav Yosef, with his stores of traditional knowledge, taught him to appreciate the value of positive knowledge.Babylonian Talmud, Baba Metzia 36b Abaye was never so happy as when one of his disciples had completed the study of a Mishnah treatise. On such occasions, he always gave a feast to his pupils,Shabbat 118b though his circumstances were needy, and wine never appeared upon his table. Abaye was a kohen. Although a descendant of the House of Eli, he died at the age of 60.Ohr Somayach, two Pillars for a Longer Life, accessed May 8, 2019Orthodox Union page on Abaye He was the father of Bebai ben Abaye. Har Yavnit Alleged Cave of Abaye and Rava on Har Yavnit ==Teaching== Despite Abaye's greatness in dialectic analysis of halakha, he was surpassed in this regard by Rava, with whom he had been closely associated from early youth. To the disputations between these amoraim we owe the development of the dialectic method in the treatment of halakhic traditions. Their debates are known as the \\"Havayot d'Abaye ve'Rava\\" (Debates of Abaye and Rava), the subjects of which were then considered such essential elements of Talmudic knowledge that by an anachronism they were thought to be known to Yohanan ben Zakkai, who lived some centuries before.Sukkah 28a Their halakhic controversies are scattered throughout the Babylonian Talmud. With the exception of six of his decisions, known by the acronym Yael Kagam (יע\\"ל קג\\"ם),Listed by Rashi to Kiddushin 52a, Bava Metzia 22b, and parallels. Tosafot (Kiddushin 52a) gave a different dispute as one of the six. A seventh dispute where halakha follows Abaye, listed by the Savoraim, is in the topic of תחילתו בפשיעה וסופו באונס (Bava Metzia 36b, 42a); however, what is accepted here is Abaye's claim regarding Rabbah's opinion, rather than Abaye's personal opinion. the opinions of Rava were always accepted as final. In Biblical exegesis, he was one of the first to draw a distinct line between the evident meaning of the text (peshat) and the sense ascribed to it by midrashic interpretation. He formulated the following rule, of great importance in Talmudic legal exegesis: \\"One Bible verse can be referred to different subjects, but several different Bible verses can not refer to one and the same subject.\\"Sanhedrin 34a He defended the Apocryphal book Ecclesiasticus against his teacher Rav Yosef. By quoting from it a number of edifying passages, he showed that it did not belong to the heretical books which are forbidden, and even compelled his teacher to admit that quotations might usefully be taken from it for homiletical purposes.Sanhedrin 100b Possessing an extensive knowledge of tradition, Abaye became an eager disciple of Dimi, the Israeli amora, who had brought to Babylonia many interpretations by Israel amoraim. Abaye considered Dimi, as a representative of the Israel school, a qualified Bible exegete, and used to ask him how this or that Bible verse was explained in \\"the West,\\" or Israel. Of Abaye's own interpretations of Biblical passages only a few, of a aggadic nature, are preserved; but he often supplements, elucidates, or corrects the opinions of older authorities.Jewish Encyclopedia: Abaye Quotes *A man should always be cunning in [his] reverence [towards God]. A gentle answer quells anger, and increases peace with his brethren and his relations, as well as with every man - even with a gentile in the market-place, so that he may become beloved above and desired below, and accepted by his fellow man.Berakhot 17a * You should cause the name of Heaven to become beloved by you: one should read and recite and serve talmidei hachamim, and engage in business pleasantly with people.

He began his senior career under Billy Young at Bohemians where he was also a youth international representing his country at the 1983 UEFA European Under-18 Football Championship where Ireland were knocked out despite not losing a game. In April 1983 he played for the League of Ireland XI U21s against their Italian League counterparts who included Roberto Mancini and Gianluca Vialli in their team . After only five League appearances, he signed for Shamrock Rovers in September 1983. After having won his third League of Ireland title with Shamrock Rovers in 1986, and making six appearances in European competition and 118 total appearances, O'Brien became Ron Atkinson's last signing as manager of Manchester United. He joined the Reds for an initial fee of £50,000.Archive Irish Times Alex Ferguson took over from Atkinson as manager in November 1986, and O'Brien made his debut in the 1986–87 season, making nine appearances, including an appearance in January 1987 where he was shown a red card just 85 seconds into a game against Southampton. The sending-off is the quickest dismissal in club history. The majority of his appearances in the 1987–88 season were as a substitute, and, frustrated by lack of first-team opportunities, he joined Newcastle United in a £275,000 move in November 1988, after 36 appearances (31 in the League) & two goals for Manchester United. His career at St James' Park brought mixed fortunes. O'Brien suffered relegation from the top flight in the 1988–89 season. However, he played a major role as Newcastle won the First Division title in 1993, making 33 appearances and scoring six goals. O'Brien found himself surplus to requirements as Newcastle rejoined the top flight and subsequently made a £350,000 move to Tranmere Rovers after a successful loan period. After Tranmere, he signed for Cork City, where he played in the UEFA Cup before returning to Bohemians in 2000 as player-coach. He enjoyed some great European nights during this season as Bohs knocked out Aberdeen and beat 1.FC Kaiserslautern. He also played a part as Bohs won the League and Cup Double before retiring as a player. ==International career== O'Brien played for the Republic of Ireland national under-19 football team that qualified for the 1983 UEFA European Under-18 Football Championship where despite remaining unbeaten in a group that included eventual winners France they were eliminated. He was also a Republic of Ireland international, winning his first cap while still at Shamrock Rovers. In all he won 16 caps as well as an U23 cap and was part of the UEFA Euro 1988 squad. ==Coaching career== After retiring as a player, O'Brien had spells as assistant manager at Bohemians and Shamrock Rovers. He was appointed first team coach of Hibernian in November 2011 by Pat Fenlon. O'Brien left Hibernian after the end of the 2012–13 season. O'Briens last coaching role was at Sligo Rovers who he joined in 2015.RTE ==Honours== Club Shamrock Rovers *League of Ireland (3): 1983–84, 1984–85, 1985–86 *FAI Cup (2): 1985, 1986 *Leinster Senior Cup: 1984–85 *LFA President's Cup (2): 1984–85, 1986–87 *Dublin City Cup: 1983–84 Newcastle United *Football League First Division: 1992–93 Individual *PFAI Young Player of the Year: 1985–86 *SWAI Personality of the Year: 1985–86 ==References== Category:1964 births Category:Living people Category:Association footballers from County Dublin Category:Republic of Ireland association footballers Category:Republic of Ireland international footballers Category:Republic of Ireland youth international footballers Category:Republic of Ireland under-23 international footballers Category:Association football midfielders Category:Bohemian F.C. players Category:Shamrock Rovers F.C. players Category:Manchester United F.C. players Category:Newcastle United F.C. players Category:Tranmere Rovers F.C. players Category:League of Ireland players Category:Cork City F.C. players Category:UEFA Euro 1988 players Category:Premier League players Category:Hibernian F.C. non-playing staff Category:English Football League players Category:League of Ireland XI players Category:Stella Maris F.C. players ","title":"Liam O'Brien (footballer, born 1964)"},{"id":"5558153","text":" The Bacchante class was a group of three iron screw corvettes in service with the Royal Navy from the late 1870s. ==Design and construction== The ships were designed by Nathaniel Barnaby in 1872, with the first two ordered from Portsmouth Royal Dockyard in 1872 and Euryalus from Chatham Royal Dockyard in 1873.

The Romualdezes, through former congressman Martin Romualdez, also own Journal Publications, Inc., the owner of tabloid papers People's Journal and People's Tonight. Initially established as the Manila Standard in 1987, it merged with another newspaper, Today, on March 6, 2005, and became the Manila Standard Today (MST). In 2015, the newspaper renamed itself as The Standard (temporarily The New Standard), before reverting to its original name in 2016. ==History== The logo used from 2005 to 2015 as Manila Standard Today Manila Standard was founded on February 11, 1987. The offices were then located at the bustling Ayala Avenue in the Makati CBD. In 1989, the group of Andres Soriano III bought out the Elizalde group and renamed the company Kagitingan Publications and relocated the offices in the Port Area, Manila. In June 1991, the group of businessman Alfonso Yuchengco bought into the company and spun off the publishing company. It was incorporated as Kamahalan Publishing Corporation. Kagitingan Publications was renamed Kagitingan Printing Press Inc., which continues to print the New Standard. In 1997, businessman Enrique K. Razon Jr., chairman and president of the International Container Terminal Services Inc., acquired the shares of the Yuchengcos and bought out the Soriano group to become the sole owner of Kamahalan Publishing Corporation and Kagitingan Printing Press Inc. Victor Agustin took over as chairman of the Editorial Board in 2008. Under his term, the company formally adopted an advocacy for the environment. In 2010, just as the Aquino administration took the reins of power, ownership of the Manila Standard Today changed hands again. This time, the Razon group sold its interest to the Romualdez group as Razon established Bloomberry Resorts & Hotels Corporation, owner of the Solaire Resort & Casino. The newspaper once again was relaunched as The Standard, featuring a tallboy broadsheet format that is similar to New York Post. The format is bigger than tabloids and smaller than newspapers, with pictures as the main inset of the front page. The new format was first implemented in the weekend issues before the full makeover happened in the weekday issues since February 23, 2015. The Standard was named as the Newspaper of the Year during the 2015 Rotary Club of Manila Journalism Awards for its balanced and crucial reporting on current issues, including the exposé story on the involvement of Wang Bo, a Chinese drug lord as the primary suspect in the Bangsamoro Basic Law payola scam. On July 25, 2016, the paper reverted to its broadsheet format, and it was renamed as Manila Standard, the newspaper's original brand name in time for President Rodrigo Duterte's first State of the Nation Address. ==Columnists== OPINION, ACTIVE: *Emil P.

The name appears in Eden's books and is considered to be canonical. Whedon explained at the time: : There was this role playing game or something. They said she hadda have a last name for her so I chose Lehane 'cause I wanted something Southie, just as you thought. — Joss Whedon at whedonesque.com ==Books and products== There are currently six commercially available titles in the Buffy the Vampire Slayer Role-playing Game (BtVSRPG) product line. In order of release, these are: BtVSRPG: Core Rulebook () The first book in the series and arguably the most essential, the Core Rulebook provides an introduction to the setting, characters and rules. The book is broken down into discrete sections which describe the mechanics and style of the game in a clear and concise manner, so as to appeal to both new gamers and experienced gamers, as well as fans of the show. The text is frequently informal and tongue-in-cheek, in keeping with the general feel of the series itself. thumb The book includes a series appendices, which describe the unique dialogue and slang used on the show, lay out the differences between the Classic and Cinematic Unisystem rules, provide charts and summaries of the more important concepts, and finally offer a full glossary and index. The Core Rulebook was initially released alongside a Limited Edition () which featured a cream-colored leatherette color, red foil Buffy logo, and red cloth bookmark. Only 1000 copies of this edition were produced. In 2005, Eden Studios released the Revised Core Rulebook () which incorporates existing errata into the book, updates some rules to bring the Buffy RPG more in line with the Angel game, and expands upon the material provided in the original Core Rulebook, providing updated characters and adversaries for the sixth and seventh seasons of the series. BtVSRPG: Slayer's Handbook () The first supplement for the BtVSRPG, the Slayer's Handbook features - as the title would imply - an expanded look at the possible backgrounds and major life events unique to Slayers, and includes such additions as the Slayer-in-Training Quality, which represents Slayers such as Kendra Young who were able to receive training before their calling. However, it also goes on to provide a number of new Qualities, Drawbacks, weapons, archetypes, and more. Aside from the new perspective on Slayers, the book may be most famous among fans for its expansion into alternate settings, offering a number of suggestions on setting a game in different time periods, locations and even parallel realities. Three complete settings exploring these themes are provided within the book. Finally, the Slayer's Handbook includes \\"The Chosen Two,\\" an adventure which can be used to continue the Djinn Season. The Slayer's Handbook was also published alongside a Limited Edition (), which featured a blue leatherette cover, red foil \\"Slayer\\" graphic, and red cloth bookmark. The name Slayer's Handbook is a double reference. In the Buffyverse, the watchers have a book for slayers referred to as the Slayer's Handbook (Giles didn't think Buffy would learn well from a book and so did not use it in training her). It is also an homage to Player's Handbook, the core book of Dungeons & Dragons, one of the first role playing games. BtVSRPG: Monster Smackdown () The BtVS equivalent of a Monster Manual, this supplement explores vampires, demons, and other adversaries in greater depth, providing an expanded and updated collection of villains and elaborating upon a number of supernatural abilities. It also introduces a few more supernatural creatures as possible player characters - notably the Troll, as defined within the Buffyverse. Like the previous books in this line, Monster Smackdown includes a Djinn Season episode, \\"The Once and Future HST,\\" which plays with events from the series as well as mythological elements. Like the Core Rulebook and Slayer's Handbook, Monster Smackdown was published alongside a Limited Edition () which featured a black leatherette cover, red foil \\"Evil\\" graphic, and red cloth bookmark. BtVSRPG: Director's Screen ( ) While the main component of this accessory is a four-panel cardstock screen, designed to shield notes and other sensitive information from the eyes of players while providing quick reference charts to the Director, the Director's Screen comes shrinkwrapped with a 56-page booklet offering a number of Directing tips as well as three pregenerated adventures for the Djinn Season. thumb BtVSRPG: The Magic Box () As implied by the title, this supplement offers an expanded ruleset for magic spells and spellcasters; however, it also provides a number of new mystical and psychic abilities, new Qualities and Drawbacks, and expands the magical milieu of the game to include Enchanters (who create blessed swords, lightning-throwing gauntlets and other such items) and Superscientists (such as Warren Mears). This supplement also includes an adventure, \\"Orphan Trouble,\\" which does not necessarily connect to the Djinn Season, but can be modified to fit within that story arc. Released as a softcover, The Magic Box did not receive the Limited Edition treatment. BtVSRPG: Character Journal () Designed as an expanded version of the character sheet already provided for the game, the Character Journal is a 16-page booklet providing a great deal of space for a single character's statistics, background, experience gains and expenditures, and even notable achievements. It is the only BtVSRPG product which does not include a pregenerated adventure module. BtVSRPG: Welcome to Sunnydale () Originally solicited for 2003, this supplement was never released. Eden Studios lost the Buffy franchise in October 2006, and with the franchise went this supplement. Welcome to Sunnydale was supposed to include historical and geographical information regarding the setting of the series, expanded descriptions of recurring characters, suggestions on setting series in Sunnydale at various points in the town's history, and a pregenerated adventure closely tied to the town. BtVSRPG: Tea and Crossbows According to Phil Masters (an English RPG Author) he had just submitted a solicited manuscript, a guide to the Watchers called Tea and Crossbows, a few days before the Eden Studios announced the loss of their license. Content is unknown, probably much like the Slayer's Handbook with the focus on the Watchers and their history. ==Canon== The Buffy RPG has already contributed to Buffyverse canon, in that Faith Lehane and Kendra Young's last names were provided by Joss Whedon in response to queries from Eden Studios. These names are now used widely throughout fiction based upon the series. ==References== Category:Contemporary role-playing games Category:Eden Studios games Category:Horror role-playing games Category:Origins Award winners Category:Role-playing games based on television series Category:Role-playing games introduced in 2002 Category:Works based on Buffy the Vampire Slayer ","title":"Buffy the Vampire Slayer Roleplaying Game"},{"id":"5558198","text":"The striped burrowing frog (Ranoidea alboguttata) is a species of burrowing frog in the family Pelodryadidae (also treated as the subfamily Pelodryadinae in the family Hylidae). It occurs throughout much of Australia, from northern New South Wales, through eastern and northern Queensland and into eastern Northern Territory. This species was once included in the genus Litoria or Cyclorana. ==Description== The female of this species grows up to in length and the male can reach an adult length of . It is brown, olive or green dorsally, with darker blotches. There is usually a pale yellow or yellow-green stripe down the back, and a dark streak runs from the snout, through the eye and the tympanum, breaking up down the flanks. This stripe has lateral skin fold above it. The backs of the thighs are dark, almost black, with large white, with some flecks brown on the throat and chest. The skin of the back has scattered warts and ridges. The belly is granular, but the throat and chest are smooth. The toes are half webbed. The tympanum is distinct. ==Ecology and behaviour== R. alboguttata lives in woodlands, grassy and cleared areas. It is usually only seen around temporary pools and water-filled claypans. The species is active by day and night. This frog is known to go through a period of torpor when resources are scant. University of Queensland researchers have discovered that their cell metabolism changes during a dormancy period, allowing the frogs to maximize the use of their limited energy resources without depleting them completely.Society for Experimental Biology (2009, June 29). C. alboguttata has been noted to secrete highly acidic mucus as defence mechanism often causing terminal injury to predator.

The call is a rapid \\"quacking\\" made from the ground or shallow water and eggs are laid in clumps near the waters edge. ==See also== This species may be confused with Ranoidea australis but can be distinguished by the lateral skin folds on either side of the dorsal surface. ==References== *Frogs Australia Network - call available here *Anstis, M. 2002.

Noarlunga Centre opened on 2 April 1978 as the terminus of the line when it was extended from Christie Downs. It was built as an island platform between the two rail tracks and the ticket office on the bridge above. Passengers accessed the platforms via escalators or a ramp and typically had a long walk between trains and buses. In 1996, a third platform face was added alongside the western track, and the ticket office relocated onto the platform level.\\"Noarlunga Centre Reconstruction\\" Railway Digest March 1996 page 17 The project was completed in March 2004, since then most trains have used this western track, giving passengers safer and more direct access to connecting buses. Prior to the Seaford expansion, Platform 1 had been disused. There are no storage facilities for trains at Noarlunga Centre. However a number of the extra railcars needed for peak-hour services on the line are stabled overnight in secure sidings at Port Stanvac, around four kilometres north, just beyond Lonsdale station. Since the 1990s, there has been significant residential development at Seaford and Aldinga, south of Noarlunga Centre with several proposals to extend the rail line southwards from Noarlunga Interchange to serve the Seaford district. A corridor of land had been reserved. In 2009, construction of the extension to Seaford commenced,Seaford rail extension moves forward as planning contracts awarded Anthony Albanese 12 August 2009Work starts on Seaford rail extension Projectlink 4 September 2009Seaford Rail Extension Project Adcor ConstructionsSeaford Rail Extension Thiess and was opened on 23 February 2014.Seaford Rail Extension opened 23 February 2014 Department for Planning, Transport & InfrastructureElectrifying opening for the new Seaford line ABC Adelaide 23 February 2014 Ticket gates have been proposed for the station to combat against fare evasion.

He usually appears as a villain in stories featuring the Norse hero Thor. Based on the fire giant Surtr from Norse mythology, and was adapted by writer Stan Lee and artist Jack Kirby, and first appeared in Journey into Mystery #97 (October 1963). The character was once described as one of \\"The Ten Most Heinous Enemies of the Mighty Thor\\".Thor #17 Annual (Dec. 1992) Surtur appeared in the Marvel Cinematic Universe film Thor: Ragnarok, motion-captured by Taika Waititi, and voiced by Clancy Brown. ==Publication history== Based on the fire giant Surtr from Norse mythology and created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby, the character first appears in Journey into Mystery #97 (Oct 1963). ==Fictional character biography== Surtur is a fire giant native to the extradimensional plane of Muspelheim, land of the fire demons and one of the nine worlds in Norse mythology. He first appears in the title Journey into Mystery, where it is claimed he sits at the end of the world waiting for the end of time where he can slay men and gods.Journey Into Mystery #97 (Oct. 1963) The character's first encounter with the Asgardian ruler Odin is told in flashback and establishes their enmity when Surtur is imprisoned by Odin inside the Earth after forming an alliance with the Trolls and trying to destroy the world in anger for Odin defying him, although he gives Odin a winged horse, hoping to be released one day.Journey Into Mystery #99 (Dec. 1963) Surtur reappears in Journey Into Mystery #104, having been freed by Odin's adopted son, Loki, who intends to usurp Odin and rule Asgard, having been given a portion of the Odinforce. Together with the Storm Giant Skagg, the character invades Earth, although the pair are met by Odin, his son the Thunder God Thor and fellow Asgardian Balder. Odin stops time and sends every human on Earth to another dimension. Surtur sends Thor into the ocean using a fireball. Skagg is saved from sinking into the ocean by Surtur hardening the ground, but is defeated by Odin, who is weakened by the feat. Surtur creates a blazing fireball and travels to the North Pole to melt the icecaps. Using Odin's sword, Thor stops Surtur and traps him on a meteorite of magnetic particles in another galaxy.Journey Into Mystery #104 (May 1964) In the title Thor the seer Volla predicts that Loki will free Surtur and other enemies of Asgard and eventually bring about Ragnarok - a war that will end with the destruction of all the Norse Gods.Thor #128 (May 1966) The character features in the title Avengers when summoned - together with ice giant Ymir - to Earth by the cult the Sons of Satannish. The entities are banished by the combined efforts of the superhero team the Avengers, the hero the Black Knight, and the sorcerer Doctor Strange. They are tricked into striking each other, which defeats them both.Avengers #61 (Feb. 1969) Surtur becomes a recurring foe in the title Thor, and first attempts to invade Asgard during the Odinsleep when Loki has briefly taken control, causing Loki to flee Asgard, but he is repelled and imprisoned.Thor #176 - 177 (May - June 1970) Surtur reappears wielding the huge magical blade Twilight, and after sending a horde of demons to invade Earth storms Asgard. The heroes of Earth battle the fire demons while in Asgard Surtur defeats both Thor and Odin in turn. Loki deceives Surtur with an illusion until Odin recovers, who battles the fire demon until both fall into a dimensional rift.Thor #337 - 338 (Nov. - Dec. 1983); #341 - 348 (Mar. - Oct. 1984); #351 - 353(Jan. - Mar. 1985) After a long absence Odin returns to Asgard, and it is revealed that he absorbed Surtur's essence, which eventually possesses him. Surtur manages to recreate his physical form and decimates Asgard until Thor, wielding the Odin Power, banishes Surtur to the Sea of Eternal Night.Thor #399 - 400 (Jan - Feb. 1989); #418 (Jun. 1990) & #425 (Oct. 1990) Surtur appears at the conclusion of the second volume of Thor during the final Ragnarok of Asgard, and is allowed to storm Asgard by Thor as the Thunder God attempts to break the endless cycle of death and rebirth for the Norse Gods.Thor vol. 2, #85 (Dec. 1984) In the limited series Stormbreaker: The Saga of Beta Ray Bill, the alien Beta Ray Bill visits the ruins of Asgard after the battle, and sees Surtur's dead form falling from the sky, still clutching Twilight.Stormbreaker: The Saga of Beta Ray Bill #1 - 6 (Mar. - Aug. 2005) Thor returns from a period of self-induced hibernation in a third self-titled volume, and enters the Odinsleep to find Odin in a limbo dimension between life and death, where Surtur stored a portion of his essence to prevent himself from being killed forever. Here Odin and the demon battle to the death, being reborn each day to repeat the cycle, preventing either from being reborn. Thor helps Odin beat Surtur twice, even though he will be reborn, before returning to his body. Thor offers to help Odin escape from this realm and the constant battle with Surtur. Odin chooses to remain in order to protect his people from the demon.Thor vol. 3, #7 - 8 (Mar. - April 2008) Surtur was resurrected and made a deal with Loki and a group of beings known as the Manchester Gods, who he manipulated to depose the native gods of the British isles.Journey into Mystery #641 He then set the world tree Yggdrasil on fire and attempted to turn the Vanir gods against the Aesir in preparation for his assault on Asgard.The Mighty Thor #19 This succeeded because of old grudges, namely Odin's insistence that the people of Vanaheim fall under his rule no matter what. ==Powers and abilities== Surtur was depicted as an immense and malevolent elemental fire demon whose power was of apocalyptic proportions. Standing over 1,000 ft. in height, Surtur possessed strength and durability far surpassing that of Thor; the ability to generate intense heat, flames or concussive force; molecular manipulation such as transforming his fingers into serpents;Journey into Mystery #99 levitation and inter-dimensional travel. Surtur's scale of power is usually shown to equal that of Odin. He is a skilled warrior and swordsman, and has a prehensile tail. He possesses a great intellect, and has vast knowledge of ancient and arcane wisdom. He is vulnerable to intense cold, and can be imprisoned by certain magical spells or by other beings wielding cosmic energy powers equaling his own. Surtur possesses the giant sword Twilight, also known as the Sword of Doom, composed of a metal known as Scabrite which can only be found in the mines of Surtur's realm. The sword is magical, capable of manipulating vast amounts of mystical energy, and can be used to perform feats such as shattering dimensional barriers and inhibiting Odin's powers. Loki has temporarily tapped into the power of the sword to change Thor into a frog (Thor is normally resistant to this type of magical transformation) and making the Asgardian populace sick (Asgardians are normally immune to disease). Morgan Le Fay tapped into the power of the sword to reshape the entire planet Earth from modern day into a medieval world after using the chaos magic of the Scarlet Witch to \\"bridge the gap\\" between her personal faerie powers and the Asgardian magics bound to the blade. When the sword is bonded with the Eternal Flame, its powers are further increased to an unknown level. The Eternal Flame has an unknown connection to Surtur. When in its vicinity, Surtur claimed it increased his powers. It is unknown to what extent this power increase leads to. ==Other versions== Surtur appears in an Amalgam Comics one-shot publication Thorion of the New Gods, in which he assaults Asgard during Ragnarök, but is stopped and imprisoned by the DC Comics Source on the Ego- Mass—an amalgamation of Ego and the Source Wall.Thorion of the New Asgods (June 1997) In the Ultimate Marvel reality, Surtur is seen summoned to Earth by Loki and battling the Ultimates.

The inhabitants are called Longuyonnais. ==Geography== Longuyon is located at the confluence of the Chiers and Crusnes rivers from Longwy. It is bordered on the north by the Belgian province of Luxembourg, just south of the Belgian village of Grandcourt. ==History== Saint Agatha's Church and cemetery The town is named after a \\"long ford\\" (from the Latin longa guada) that allowed crossing of the Chiers in Roman times. It was known as Longagio (634), Longio (973), Longione (973), monasterri longagionis (10th century), Longion (1030), Longuion (1209), Longuio (1756). Several Gallo-Roman sites were excavated in 1934 containing the remains of substructures and fragments of painted plaster. A necropolis of the later Roman Empire was excavated in 1843 in Magé. The first mention of Longuyon (as Longagio) dates from 634. At that time there is already a chapel dedicated to Saint Agatha, which became a collegiate church in 1120, and later served as a barracks for French soldiers in 1636. The castle of Mussy, first mentioned in 1144, was razed in 1670 by the French occupation troops by order of Louis XIV. Longuyon was a capital of the Bailiwick of Longuyon from June 1751 to 1789, then the capital of the Canton of Longuyon until March 2015. In 1914 the town had 2,300 inhabitants. It was devastated on August 23–24 of that year by the Prussian infantry and 86 inhabitants, men, women, and children, were executed by firing squad. Longuyon has long been an important railroad crossroads, located between the iron ore of the Briey basin and the coal mining area of the North. The apartment blocks on the southwestern edge of town, still called \\"La Cité Canadienne\\", were home to Royal Canadian Air Force staff and their families in the 1950s and 1960s, when the RCAF had an airbase at nearby Marville. The street names still carry the names Toronto, Montreal, etc., and a totem pole was erected as a monument to the Canadian presence in Longuyon. ==Attractions== The prominent buildings in Longuyon include the Collegiate Church of St. Agatha from the 13th century. The church was mentioned for the first time in 634 in the will of the deacon Adalgisel Grimo. The St. Agatha monastery was converted to a collegiate church in 973 by the Archbishop of Trier, then into a Benedictine priory in the late twelfth century, before being permanently restored as a collegiate church in the early thirteenth century. Since the French Revolution it has been a parish church. The current building was built in the late twelfth and early thirteenth century, with the base of the tower appearing to be slightly earlier. The church was fortified in the sixteenth century with a gatehouse above the western portal and defensive elements. ==See also== *Jacques de Longuyon *Communes of the Meurthe-et-Moselle department Category:Communes of Meurthe-et-Moselle Category:Duchy of Bar ","title":"Longuyon"},{"id":"5558262","text":"Lapalisse () is a commune in the Allier department in central France.

Specifically, given a homogeneous polynomial, polarization produces a multilinear form from which the original polynomial can be recovered by evaluating along a certain diagonal. Although the technique is deceptively simple, it has applications in many areas of abstract mathematics: in particular to algebraic geometry, invariant theory, and representation theory. Polarization and related techniques form the foundations for Weyl's invariant theory. ==The technique== The fundamental ideas are as follows. Let f(u) be a polynomial in n variables u = (u1, u2, ..., un). Suppose that f is homogeneous of degree d, which means that :f(t u) = td f(u) for all t. Let u(1), u(2), ..., u(d) be a collection of indeterminates with u(i) = (u1(i), u2(i), ..., un(i)), so that there are dn variables altogether. The polar form of f is a polynomial :F(u(1), u(2), ..., u(d)) which is linear separately in each u(i) (i.e., F is multilinear), symmetric in the u(i), and such that :F(u,u, ..., u)=f(u). The polar form of f is given by the following construction :F({\\\\mathbf u}^{(1)},\\\\dots,{\\\\mathbf u}^{(d)})=\\\\frac{1}{d!}\\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial\\\\lambda_1}\\\\dots\\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial\\\\lambda_d}f(\\\\lambda_1{\\\\mathbf u}^{(1)}+\\\\dots+\\\\lambda_d{\\\\mathbf u}^{(d)})_{\\\\lambda=0}. In other words, F is a constant multiple of the coefficient of λ1 λ2...λd in the expansion of f(λ1u(1) \\\\+ ... + λdu(d)). ==Examples== *Suppose that x=(x,y) and f(x) is the quadratic form :f({\\\\mathbf x}) = x^2 + 3 x y + 2 y^2. Then the polarization of f is a function in x(1) = (x(1), y(1)) and x(2) = (x(2), y(2)) given by :F({\\\\mathbf x}^{(1)},{\\\\mathbf x}^{(2)}) = x^{(1)}x^{(2)}+\\\\frac{3}{2}x^{(2)}y^{(1)}+\\\\frac{3}{2}x^{(1)}y^{(2)}+2 y^{(1)}y^{(2)}. *More generally, if f is any quadratic form, then the polarization of f agrees with the conclusion of the polarization identity. *A cubic example. Let f(x,y)=x3 \\\\+ 2xy2. Then the polarization of f is given by :F(x^{(1)},y^{(1)},x^{(2)},y^{(2)},x^{(3)},y^{(3)})= x^{(1)}x^{(2)}x^{(3)}+\\\\frac{2}{3}x^{(1)}y^{(2)}y^{(3)}+\\\\frac{2}{3}x^{(3)}y^{(1)}y^{(2)}+\\\\frac{2}{3}x^{(2)}y^{(3)}y^{(1)}. ==Mathematical details and consequences== The polarization of a homogeneous polynomial of degree d is valid over any commutative ring in which d! is a unit. In particular, it holds over any field of characteristic zero or whose characteristic is strictly greater than d. The polarization isomorphism (by degree) For simplicity, let k be a field of characteristic zero and let be the polynomial ring in n variables over k. Then A is graded by degree, so that :A = \\\\bigoplus_d A_d. The polarization of algebraic forms then induces an isomorphism of vector spaces in each degree :A_d \\\\cong Sym^d k^n where Symd is the d-th symmetric power of the n-dimensional space kn. These isomorphisms can be expressed independently of a basis as follows. If V is a finite-dimensional vector space and A is the ring of k-valued polynomial functions on V, graded by homogeneous degree, then polarization yields an isomorphism :A_d \\\\cong Sym^d V^*. The algebraic isomorphism Furthermore, the polarization is compatible with the algebraic structure on A, so that :A \\\\cong Sym^\\\\cdot V^* where Sym⋅V∗ is the full symmetric algebra over V∗. Remarks * For fields of positive characteristic p, the foregoing isomorphisms apply if the graded algebras are truncated at degree p-1. * There do exist generalizations when V is an infinite dimensional topological vector space. ==References== * Claudio Procesi (2007) Lie Groups: an approach through invariants and representations, Springer, .

It is held in the middle of August each year, from Wednesday through Saturday, in Kinzers, Pennsylvania, about eight miles east of the city of Lancaster. The association’s name is taken from the 1890s book Rough and Tumble Engineering: Book of Instructions for Operators of Farm and Traction Engines by James H. Maggard. ==Threshermen== Threshermen were crews of laborers who owned their own traction engine and threshing machinery, and moved from farm to farm to bring in and thresh the wheat harvest. Many crews covered several states and several hundred miles each season. Farmers and their wives would compete to gain and keep the services of the best threshing crews. Threshermen were made obsolete by the development of the combine harvester in the 1940s and 1950s. ==Reunions== The first Rough and Tumble reunion was held in 1948 on the grounds of Arthur S. Young's farm equipment dealership south of U.S. Route 30 at the east end of Kinzers, Pennsylvania, about eight miles east of the city of Lancaster. Young and his father had maintained a number of steam traction engines, and Young served as an officer of the Pennsylvania Threshermen and Farmers Protective Association. A number of local steam engine enthusiasts encouraged Young to hold a Threshers Reunion to showcase his collection of engines, and the PTFPA agreed to provide free food and advertising for the event. The Rev. Elmer Ritzman, the founding editor of Iron Man Album (a magazine devoted to preserving the heritage of threshing and farm life in general, now owned by Ogden Publications and titled Steam Traction Magazine) was a major proponent of the first R&T; show, and served as an R&T; director for many years. ==Traction engine collection== R&T; has one of the world’s best and largest collections of old traction engines, with over two dozen machines. There are also all kinds of antique farm implements and machinery, plus three barns full of old steam engines and old stationary gas engines, including an Otto-Langen Engine, one of the world’s few surviving examples of the first commercially successful gas engines, almost all of which are kept in operating condition, and are run during the Threshermen’s Reunion and other shows. There is also a 2/3 scale Shay side-geared steam locomotive that provides rides, as well as a smaller live steam locomotive named Little Toot. Most of the events, especially the Threshermen’s Reunion, has scores of crafters, including local Amish and Mennonite residents, and scores of flea market vendors who come from all over the country. In addition to the Threshermen’s Reunion held in the middle of August, R&T; offers a two-day “Steam School” of hands-on learning, an Antique Tractor Pull in April, a Spring Steam-Up in May, Blacksmith Days in June, and a celebration of A Time of Harvest in October. Additionally, various collectors associations hold events at R&T;, including John Deere Days and an International Harvester / Farmall show. ==Railroads== The association runs two railroads on its property for guest to enjoy.Railroaddata.com - Rough and Tumble Engineers Historical Association One is the narrow gaugeSteamlocomotive.com - Pennsylvania Shay Railroad, featuring a coal-fired, geared steam locomotive.

Sargent is a fishing, boating, and water sports community with a variable population, as most of its inhabitants are weekend commuters from larger cities such as Houston, Austin, and San Antonio. Sargent is on Farm Road 457, five miles northwest of the Gulf of Mexico and twenty-four miles southeast of Bay City in the eastern corner of Matagorda County. Approximately 500 permanent residents live in the Sargent area, while on holiday weekends the population may swell to as high as 5,000. The Sargent area, with its proximity to the Gulf of Mexico, East Matagorda Bay, the Intracoastal Waterway, and Caney Creek, is home base to many commercial and sport fisherman and shrimpers. Red drum (aka Redfish), Spotted Seatrout (aka Speckled Trout), Flounder, Blue Crab and shrimp are among the local favorites. In addition to the local fishing, one of the unique appeals of Sargent is that many of the homesites are waterfront. Several developments, such as Caney Creek Estates became established in the late 1950s and early 1960s. Following the widespread damage caused by Hurricane Carla in 1961, other developments such as Downey's Caney Creek, Caney Court, and Caney Creek Haven were established, including new waterfront lots created by the digging of manmade canals off Caney Creek and the Intracoastal Waterway. Many waterfront lots were originally sold as campsites. Much of Sargent still has a fishing camp influence with many recreational vehicles present, although the majority of developed homesites now have permanent dwellings. Also prevalent are the many private wooden piers and docks, where modern recreational watercraft can be docked. Most piers also have electric fishing lights that allow night fishing, particularly during the colder months where Spotted Seatrout are known to feed as they migrate inland. Sargent Beach, where multiple rows of beach houses in the 1960s eventually succumbed to continual coastal erosion, has received more attention to preserve what remains of this relatively narrow island bordered by the Gulf of Mexico, the Intracoastal Waterway, Mitchell's Cut into East Matagorda Bay, and the San Bernard River far to the east. ==History== Sargent was named for George Thomas Sargent. Sargent and his family relocated to Texas from England in 1834, and established a permanent residence in Matagorda County in 1938, quickly becoming a major land owner in the area. Sargent and his daughter-in-law, Sarah Ann, drowned in a hurricane in 1875. They are buried in a small family cemetery located in Caney Creek Estates and maintained by local residents. The site was awarded a historical marker by the Texas Historical Commission in 1986. ==Geography== Mitchell's Cut Mitchell's Cut is basically the continuation of Caney Creek. Caney Creek is almost long enough to be a river and has often had brackish water, even a few miles inland. The \\"Pass\\" runs into the gulf and is 1/4 mile down the cut, past the entrance to East Matagorda Bay. The \\"cut\\" is a favorite fishing site for families, and anglers. Many favorite local boat park onshore, anchor and wade in various fishing spots are in this area, such as \\"Leroy's Hole.\\" Occasionally, an incoming blue ocean current will run into the pass at the beach-front for excellent fishing. The cut also allows boat passage to the gulf for offshore fishing and shrimping, and is vital to the live bait and shrimp sales for the community. The \\"Cut\\" (known as the Caney Creek Gulf Cut, or Mitchell's Cut) is the only pass from Freeport to Matagorda and has obvious importance to East Matagorda Bay, Sargent, and the people who live in the general area. The shore line between Sargent's pass is a stretch of land between the gulf and East Matagorda Bay and part of the Matagorda Peninsula. The pass allows for drainage of water from Caney Creek past the Intracoastal Waterway, into the gulf or East Matagorda Bay, especially in times of large rainfall in the drainage basins adjacent to Caney Creek. There are a multitude of shifting tides, water depth, and new sandbars throughout the year. A common problem is a sand bar that runs across the cut about 100 yards out and affects the bigger shrimp boats on a low tide. File:Sargent TX Caney Creek.jpgCaney Creek looking downstream at Crab Trap Grill File:Sargent TX Caney Creek2.jpgCaney Creek looking upstream at Hawkins Road bridge ==Preservation and development== The most notable effort to protect Sargent Beach was obtaining funding for and completing development of a granite breakwater revetment designed and installed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in the early 1990s. This substructure is designed to help prevent coastal erosion and protect inland homes from storm surge in the event of a tropical cyclone making landfall near the area. In 2013, Coastal Technology Corporation from Austin, Texas, in conjunction with the Conrad Blucher Institute of Texas A&M; University-Corpus Christi, received two grants totalling $340,000 from the Port of Bay City Authority to study improving the pass. In early 2017, construction began on a pier built with concrete pilings extending into the Gulf at Sargent Beach. The pier project, first proposed in 2013, was funded by the federal Coastal Impact Assistance Program (CIAP) and administered by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. The structure was originally designed to be a 10-foot wide pier, extending approximately 500 feet into the Gulf, terminating with a 140 foot wide T-Head. The pier surface was expected to be approximately 17.9 feet above mean low tide. On April 13, 2017, it was announced that construction of the Sargent Fishing Pier would be \\"temporarily halted\\", due to lack of funds. This funding cut resulted in the pier coming in short at approximately 180 feet, barely reaching the water at low tide. ==Government== Sargent has a volunteer fire department, a branch of the Bay City Library, and a community post office. The mayor of Sargent is Jim Baker. File:Sargent TX Volunteer Fire.jpgSargent Volunteer Fire Department is on FM 457. File:Sargent TX Library.jpgSargent Branch of the Bay City Library is on FM 457.

Perth, Western Australia was occupied by British settlers in 1829 and originally named the Swan River Colony. Many of the older buildings are still extant, and have been heritage-listed. The places are listed here in chronological order and include significant buildings in the Perth metropolitan area. Included are examples of governmental, religious, residential, commercial and institutional buildings. Places of identified heritage significance in metropolitan and regional Western Australia are listed in the official \\"InHerit\\" database which includes the State Register of Heritage Places, local government inventories and other lists, the Australian Government's heritage list, and other non-government lists and surveys.Search Heritage Places at W.A. State Heritage Office Western Australia’s settlements struggled in the 1800s from lack of resources, labour and investment. The gold rushes of the 1890s brought a great influx of people from interstate and overseas, and considerable development arising from the new wealth. Many ornate and substantial buildings were constructed in the metropolitan area from the 1890s to the early-mid 1900s, including the Palace Hotel, Perth, the Esplanade Hotel, Fremantle, His Majesty's Theatre, Perth and the Old Perth Technical School. In the late 1950s, a group of individuals who were concerned for the need to \\"preserve our heritage\\" came together to form the National Trust of Australia (WA) in 1959.Barracks to the Burrup, p 49 The National Trust’s mandate was to educate the public on the importance of valuing our landscapes.Barracks to the Burrup, p 80 At this time, there was no legislation or a statutory body in WA to formally recognise and protect heritage places. The National Trust was able to promote and bring attention to the significance of the state's heritage places including natural landscapes and buildings which were supported by heritage assessments of buildings with a classification system.Barracks to the Burrup, p 90 In 1965, an Act of Parliament established the National Trust as a statutory body in WA and properties were able to be vested under the responsibility of the organisation.Barracks to the Burrup, p 109 A mining boom in the 1960s-70s led to another wave of intensive development in Perth and as a result the city lost many of its early 1900s buildings, particularly along St Georges Terrace. From this time, a greater awareness in the community of the loss of heritage places developed as demonstrated by several high profile public campaigns for the Pensioner Barracks (now the Barracks Arch), the Palace Hotel on St Georges Terrace and the Swan Brewery. The lack of statutory protection for heritage places was a serious issue in WA and it wasn’t until the adoption of the Heritage Act of WA 1990 and the formation of the Heritage Council that post- colonial heritage places were given recognition and statutory protection under the State Register of Heritage Places. This work is undertaken by the State Heritage Office which supports the Heritage Council and Minister for Heritage. Aboriginal heritage places are dealt with separately under the Aboriginal Heritage Act 1972. Further, under the Heritage Act of WA 1990, each local government in Western Australia is required to compile a Municipal Heritage Inventory which identifies places of heritage significance within their municipality. The National Trust of Australia (WA) since the early 1960s has maintained a List of Classified Places. Classification by the National Trust does not provide statutory protection; instead these assessments provide a record of heritage places (historic, natural and Aboriginal) and support the Trust’s education and advocacy programs. The National Trust's List of Classified Places can be searched via the \\"inHerit\\" website. Thousands of places across Western Australia have been recognised for their heritage significance. The recognition, protection and conservation of these heritage places has developed from individuals and communities who value these places and understand the contribution they make to WA’s history, culture and environment. ==List== {  - !Building !Construction period !HCWA link !Notes !Image - !colspan=5  1830s - The Round House Fremantle 1830  Built as a prison shortly after the establishment of the Swan River Colony in 1829. 120px - The Old Mill South Perth 1835  also known as Shenton's Mill.

She was a member of the House of Savoy. On the day of her baptism, Pope Pius IX, her godfather, gave her a Golden Rose. Maria Pia was married to Luís on the 6 October 1862 in Lisbon. She was the grand mistress of the Order of Saint Isabel. ==Biography== Maria Pia was the daughter of Victor Emmanuel II, the first King of Italy, by his wife Adelaide of Austria. Her sister Maria Clotilde was the \\"princesse Napoléon\\" as wife of Napoléon Joseph Charles Paul Bonaparte, and her brothers were King Umberto I of Italy and King Amadeo of Spain Maria Pia of Savoy as a young woman, 1863 Maria Pia, Queen of Portugal, Prado Museum Maria Pia married King Luís I of Portugal on 6 October 1862 at the age of 14 in the São Domingos Church in Lisbon, therefore she instantly became Queen consort of Portugal. One year after the wedding, Maria Pia gave birth to her first son and heir, Carlos, Duke of Braganza. In 1865 she had another son, Afonso, Duke of Porto. As Queen, Maria Pia was considered by some as extravagant, but far more for her many charitable works in aid of the Portuguese people. She was known by the Portuguese people as an \\"angel of charity\\" and \\"mother of the poor\\" for her compassion and work on social causes. At a masquerade ball in 1865, she changed her costume three times. When the Portuguese parliament discussed her expenses, she replied saying \\"if you want a Queen, you have to pay for her\\". As Queen, she was largely responsible for the interiors of the Ajuda Royal Palace in Lisbon, still used to this time for banquets during state visits by foreign heads of state. Maria Pia did not involve herself in politics, but at a conflict with João Carlos Saldanha de Oliveira Daun, 1st Duke of Saldanha in 1870, she stated: \\"If I were the king, I would have you shot!\\" King Luís died on 19 October 1889 and Maria Pia became queen dowager. She remained very active and continued with her social projects while holding a dominating position at court. She served as regent during the absence of the king and queen abroad. The queen dowager was devastated after the assassination of her son King Carlos I of Portugal and grandson Crown Prince Luís Filipe, Duke of Braganza, on 1 February 1908 on the Praça do Comércio in Lisbon. During her last years in Portugal, she withdrew from the public eye. She was deeply saddened after the military coup that deposed her remaining grandson, King Manuel II of Portugal by the 5 October 1910 Revolution. ==Exile and death== Due to the 1910 coup that deposed Maria Pia’s grandson, Manuel II, and established the republic in Portugal, the whole Portuguese royal family was exiled.

After leaving Oxford in 1979, Yule went to Peru for eight months working as photographer on The Cusichaca Project near Cusco. In 1980 he founded Berwick Universal Pictures with photographer Chris Plytas, working from a basement studio in Berwick Street, London, and that same year he did the cover photography and design for Rowan Atkinson's Live in Belfast album. In 1983, following several visits to Peru, his book The New Incas (with an introduction by John Hemming) was published by The New Pyramid Press and the photographs were exhibited widely, including at Side Gallery in Newcastle, the Royal Geographical Society and The Photographers' Gallery in London. Photography in Peru became the subject of his first documentary film, Martin Chambi and the Heirs of the Incas (1986), made for the BBC's Arena strand, which depicts the life, times, and contemporary relevance of that great Cusqueña photographer of the early 20th century. This was the first of half a dozen documentaries Yule made in Peru over the next two decades, and the start of an award-winning collaboration with the producer Andy Harries. In 1990 Yule made Trains That Passed in the Night, a lyrical film about another photographer, the American O. Winston Link, whose troubled personal story he was to return to and re- assess 15 years later in The Photographer, His Wife, Her Lover (2005).Mark Feeney, \\"Documentary is a complex tale of grand theft photo\\", Boston Globe, 15 December 2006. In 1991-92 Yule's Channel 4 documentary Damned in the USA, a film about censorship and the arts in the US that features Rev. Donald Wildmon of the American Family Association, became embroiled in a landmark legal dispute. Though the film had already won the International Emmy, Wildmon and the AFA sued Yule, his co-producer Jonathan Stack, and Channel 4 for $8 million in an attempt to stop the distribution of the film, describing it as \\"blasphemous and obscene\\". Yule and his co-defendants fought the lawsuit in court in Mississippi and won the legal right to freely exhibit the film. Lou Reed re-wrote the lyrics to his classic \\"Walk on the Wild Side\\" in support of the case. The subject matter of Yule's films has included history, politics, religion, sport, education, and the arts. He has collaborated with several writers, including with Nicholas Shakespeare on films about Mario Vargas Llosa (1990) and Bruce Chatwin (1999); with Peter Oborne on exposés of Robert Mugabe (2003) and the conspiracy surrounding the cricketer Basil D'Oliveira (2004); as well as with Darcus Howe, Miranda Sawyer, Paul Morley, Luke Holland and others. In 2003 he directed an acclaimed drama about Sir Edward Elgar, Elgar's Tenth Muse starring James Fox and written by Nigel Gearing. He has also made a number of films in war zones, often shooting his own material - notably Babitski's War (2000, in Chechnya), The House of War (2002, in Afghanistan), Mugabe's Secret Famine (2003, in Zimbabwe), Here's One We Invaded Earlier (2003, in Afghanistan) and All Out In Pakistan (2017, in Pakistan). Producers with whom he has had notable collaborations have included Jonathan Stack, George Carey, Roy Ackerman, Samir Shah and Markus Davies. In 2008 Yule completed a three-film 60-year history of apartheid in South Africa and its consequences (White Lies, 1994 - about the International Defence and Aid Fund; The Basil D'Oliveira Conspiracy, 2004; and The Captain and the Bookmaker, 2008https://mg.co.za/article/2008-06-06-hansie-the-story-never-dies– the latter two of which focus on the political history of South Africa as seen through the prism of cricket, including the downfall of Hansie Cronje).Steve Newall, \\"Interview: Paul Yule, Director of Cricket Doco 'The Captain and the Bookmaker'\\", Flicks, 10 November 2016. In 2011 he was invited to teach filmmaking for a year at The University of Cape Town. While there he originated \\"The Big Picture\\", an intensive, hands-on documentary film production course aimed at training a new generation of filmmakers and technicians to make fresh, socially relevant, local programming. In conjunction with this he was centrally involved in the re-launch of Cape Town's community television station, CTV. In 2013 and 2015 he directed and was show-runner on two seasons of Dream School SA, an acclaimed reality series about education in South Africa.Broadcast on M-Net and SABC2 In 2016 he made All Out In Pakistan (BBC, 2017). Structured around Peter Oborne's \\"Wounded Tiger\\" cricket tours, the film looks at the relationship of cricket to politics in Pakistan. Most recently he completed The Life of Jo Menell (2019), a film about the iconoclastic activist filmmaker, which received its World Premiere at The Encounters Documentary Film Festival. He is currently working on \\"My Developing Eye\\", a photographic retrospective. Yule is married to the cartoonist Denise Dorrance and has four children. ==Filmography== *Martin Chambi and the Heirs of the Incas (1986) *Our God the Condor (1987) *Iquitos (1988) *Mario Vargas Llosa: The Story of the Novelist Who Would Be President (1990) *O Winston Link: Trains that Passed in the Night (1990) *Damned in the USA (1991) *As American as Apple Pie (1992) *Good Morning Mr Hitler!

The woman and the daughter refuse to help, and the woman's stepdaughter offers to show him. In return, the others turn black and ugly, but the stepdaughter is granted three wishes: beauty, an everlasting purse of gold, and to go to Heaven upon her death. Her brother Reginer, a coachman to the king, asks for a portrait of her, and hangs it in his room. The king sees it and resolves to marry her. Her brother sends for her, and the stepmother and stepsister come too. The stepmother enchants the coachman so he is half-blind, and the bride so she is half-deaf. The white bride does not hear what the coachman says, and instead follows the stepmother's command to remove her dress and garments, and then to look out the window, where she is pushed out. The king is horrified by the black bride, and throws the brother into a snakepit, but the stepmother persuades him to marry the black bride. A white duck comes to the kitchen and tells the kitchen boy to light the fire, and then asks of Reginer and the black bride. After a few days of this, the kitchen boy tells the king. The king cuts off the duck's head, which transforms into the white bride. The king frees the brother from the snake pit and asks the stepmother what ought to be done to someone that did the deed that she had done. She says that person should be stripped and put in a barrel studded with nails, and a horse should drag it off. The king has it done to her and the black bride, and he proceeds to marry the white bride. ==ReferencesFurther reading== * Belmont, Nicole, and Brunhilde Biebuyck. \\"Myth and Folklore in Connection with AT 403 and 713.\\" Journal of Folklore Research 20, no. 2/3 (1983): 185-96. www.jstor.org/stable/3814531. ==External links== *SurLaLune Fairy Tale site The White Bride and the Black One Category:Grimms' Fairy Tales Category:Fiction about shapeshifting Category:Literary duos Category:Works about marriage Category:Female characters in fairy tales Category:German fairy tales ","title":"The White Bride and the Black One"},{"id":"5558411","text":"The alphabetical list of philosophers is so large it had to be broken up into several pages.

K. (1990). Translation of The History of al- Tabari: The Last Years of the Prophet, Volume 9, pp. 134-135. He married Barra bint Samawal of the neighbouring Qurayza tribe: and had at least one son and two daughters with her. Barra bint Samawal was from distinguished Arabian Jewish family. Her father was the poet al Samaw'al ibn Adiya. Personality Huyayy is said to have been a \\"courageous warrior\\" and a \\"learned man\\".Gottheil, Richard and M.

After the hijrah -- 622 CE According to his daughter, Huyayy opposed Muhammad from the day he arrived in Medina. She recalled: :I was my father's and my uncle Abu Yasir's favorite child. They could never see me with one of their children without picking me up. When the Messenger of Allah came to Medina, my father and my uncle went to see him. It was very early in the morning and between dawn and sunrise. They did not return until the sun was setting. They came back worn out and depressed, walking with slow, heavy steps. I smiled to them as I always did, but neither of them took any notice of me because they were so miserable. I heard Abu Yasir ask my father, “Is it him?” He replied: “Yes, it is.” Abu Yasir asked: “Do you recognize him? Can you confirm it?” He answered: “Yes, I recognize him only too well.” Abu Yasir asked: “What do you feel towards him?” He replied: “Enmity, enmity as long as I live.”Guillaume, A. The Life of Muhammad: Translation of Ibn Ishaq's Sirat Rasul Allah. At first Huyayy's opposition simply took the form of public debates. On one occasion, he had a discussion with Muhammad upon the mystical letters beginning some of the Surahs in the Quran. When a prominent rabbi, Abdullah ibn Salam, became a Muslim, Huyayy was one of those who said to him: \\"There are no prophets among the Arabs, but your master is an ordinary human king.\\" When Abu Sufyan, the Quraysh leader and an enemy of Muhammad, presented himself before Huyayy's house, he, fearing to compromise himself, refused to admit him. But Huyayy was to become the most inveterate enemy of Muhammad, to the point where ibn Hisham, Muhammad's biographer, calls him the enemy of Allah. In summer 625, Muhammad went to the Nadir quarter to ask them to contribute towards the army, secondary to Umayya's killing of two men from Banu Kilab. Huyayy agreed to give it to him, but as Muhammad was waiting by the wall of one of their houses their plan to assassinate him became apparent, he hurried away along with his companions and returned to Medina. When his followers asked him why he had left in such a hurry, He replied that the Angel Gabriel had warned him that Huyayy ibn Akhtab was urging the Jews to kill him and that 'Amr ibn Jahsh had volunteered to drop a rock onto his head. Because of this action, Muhammad ended alliance with the Nadir tribe and that act of treachery from the Jews meant that they were at war with one another. He then sent one of his companions (Muhammad bin Muslimah) to issue an ultimatum to the Jews. They were to leave Medina within a specified amount of time. When the Jews refused to leave at the behest of fake Muslims (The Hypocrites) Muhammad decided to take military action and besieged the Jews in their fortresses. After six nights of this, the Jews agreed to lay down arms and they were given safe passage out of Medina; they were also allowed to take all of their belongings with them except their military arms. From there the Jews settled in Khaybar and some in Syria.When The Moon Split / A Biography of the Prophet Muhhammad Expulsion of Banu Nadir to Khaybar -- 625 CE Huyayy and his family settled at Khaibar, where the Jewish farming community not only welcomed them, but deferred to them as leaders. Huyayy incited the Khaibarites, with the Arab tribes of Quraish and Ghatafan, into active revolt against Muhammad, resulting in the Battle of the Trench in 627. Battle of the Trench -- 627 CE Huyayy came to Ka'b ibn As'ad, the chief of the Banu Quraiza in Medina, but failed to incite him to war against Muhammad. The day after the Confederates lifted the siege against Medina, Muhammad besieged the fortress of the Qurayza, and they surrendered in May 627. According to Ibn Ishaq: :Then the apostle went out to the market of Medina (which is still its market today) and dug trenches in it. Then he sent for them and struck off their heads in those trenches as they were brought out to him in batches. Among them was the enemy of Allah Huyayy ibn Akhtab and Kaab ibn Asad their chief. There were 600 or 700 in all, though some put the figure as high as 800 or 900. ... Huyayy was brought out wearing a flowered robe in which he had made holes about the size of the finger-tips in every part so that it should not be taken from him as spoil, with his hands bound to his neck by a rope. When he saw the apostle he said, ‘By God, I do not repent of having opposed you, but he who forsakes God will be forsaken.’ Then he went to the men and said, ‘God’s command is right. A book and a decree, and massacre have been written against the Sons of Israel.’ Then he sat down and his head was struck off. Huyayy had a daughter with Barra bint Samawal: Safiyya bint Huyayy. Safiyyah later became a wife of Muhammad. ==See also== *Non-Muslim interactants with Muslims during Muhammad's era *List of battles of Muhammad ==Resources== Category:Banu Nadir Category:Hejazi Jews Category:Jews of the Jewish tribes of Arabia Category:7th-century Jews ","title":"Huyayy ibn Akhtab"},{"id":"5558449","text":"Cassagnes is the name or part of the name of the following communes in France: *Cassagnes, Lot, in the Lot department *Cassagnes, Pyrénées-Orientales, in the Pyrénées-Orientales department *Cassagnes-Bégonhès, in the Aveyron department ==People with the surname== *André Cassagnes (1926–2013), French inventor *Louis Victorin Cassagne (1774–1841), French general of the Napoleonic Wars ","title":"Cassagnes"},{"id":"5558452","text":"Claudianus Ecdidius Mamertus (died c. 473) was a Gallo-Roman theologian and the brother of Saint Mamertus, Bishop of Vienne. ==Biography== Descended probably from one of the leading families of the country, Claudianus Mamertus relinquished his worldly goods and embraced the monastic life. He assisted his brother in the discharge of his functions, and Sidonius Apollinaris describes him as directing the psalm-singing of the chanters, who were formed into groups and chanted alternate verses, whilst the bishop was at the altar celebrating the sacred mysteries.\\"Psalmorum hic modulator et phonascus ante altaria fratre gratulante instructas docuit sonare classes\\" (Epist., IV, xi, 6; V, 13-15). This passage is of importance in the history of liturgical chant. In the same epigram, which constitutes the epitaph of Claudianus Mamertus, Sidonius also informs us that this distinguished scholar composed a lectionary, that is, a collection of readings from Sacred Scripture to be made on the occasion of certain celebrations during the year. ==Writings== According to the same writer, Claudianus \\"pierced the sects with the power of eloquence\\", an allusion to a prose treatise entitled \\"On the State of the Soul\\" or \\"On the Substance of the Soul\\". Written between 468 and 472, this work was destined to combat the ideas of Faustus, Bishop of Reii (modern Riez, in the department of Basses-Alpes), particularly his thesis on the corporeity of the soul. Plato, whom he perhaps read in Greek, Porphyry, and especially Plotinus and Saint Augustine furnished Claudianus with arguments. But his method was decidedly peripatetic and foretokened Scholasticism. Even his language had the same characteristics as that of some of the medieval philosophers: hence Claudianus used many abstract adverbs in \\"ter\\" (essentialiter, accidenter, etc.; forty according to La Broise). On the other hand, he revived obsolete words and, in a letter to Sapaudus of Vienne, a rhetorician, sanctioned the imitation of Nævius, Plautus, Varro and Gracchus. Undoubtedly his only acquaintance with these authors was through the quotations used by grammarians and the adoption of their style by Apuleius, whose works he eagerly studied. Of course this tendency to copy his predecessors led Claudianus to acquire an entirely artificial mode of expression which Sidonius, in wishing to compliment him, called a modern antique (Epist., IV, iii, 3). Besides the treatise and the letter from Claudianus to Sidonius Apollinaris, found among the letters of the latter (IV, ii), some poetry has also been ascribed to him, although erroneously. For instance, he has been credited with the \\"Pange, lingua\\", which is by Venantius Fortunatus (Carm., II, ii); \\"Contra vanos poetas ad collegam\\", a poem recommending the choice of Christian subjects and written by Paulinus of Nola (Carm., xxii); two short Latin poems in honour of Christ, one by Claudius Claudianus (Birt ed., p. 330; Koch ed., p. 248) and the other by Merobaudes (Vollmer ed., p. 19), and two other Greek poems on the same subject, again believed to be the work of Claudius Claudianus. Claudianus was the addressee of a volume óf commentary by the bishop Salonius on the latter part of the book of Ecclesiastes.Philip Schaff, Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers, Second Series: Theodoret, Jerome, Gennadius, Rufinus: Historical Writings (Cosimo, Inc., 1 June 2007), p. 397 ==Reputation== Two facts assign Claudianus Mamertus a place in the history of thought: he took part in the reaction against Semipelagianism, which took place in Gaul towards the close of the fifth century and he was the precursor of Scholasticism, forestalling the system of Roscellinus and Abelard. The logical method pursued by Claudianus commanded the esteem and investigation of Berengarius of Tours, Nicholas of Clairvaux, secretary to Saint Bernard, and Richard de Fournival. ==See also== *School of the Sextii ==ReferencesSources== * Catholic Encyclopedia article ==External links== *Opera Omnia by Migne Patrologia Latina with analytical indexes Category:473 deaths Category:Correspondents of Sidonius Apollinaris Category:Roman Catholic theologians Category:5th-century Gallo-Roman people Category:Year of birth unknown Category:5th-century Latin writers Category:5th-century Roman poets Category:Latin letter writers ","title":"Claudianus Mamertus"},{"id":"5558453","text":"Francesca Beard (born 1968) is a Malaysian writer and performance poet.

Axe began his career in 1959 with the Rootes Group where he progressed first to chief stylist and then to design director. Rootes became part of Chrysler Europe in 1966. Axe led the styling efforts on almost all of the Chrysler/Rootes/Simca products of the early to mid-1970s; the car models involved included the Simca 1308/Chrysler Alpine and Chrysler Horizon which won European Car of the Year in 1976 and 1978, respectively. Following Chrysler Europe's collapse in 1977, Axe moved to Detroit to head Chrysler's styling studios in the United States. In 1982, Axe returned to the United Kingdom, joining British Leyland (BL) where he took over as styling director from David Bache (who had been sacked from BL owing to disagreements with the company boss Harold Musgrove over the still under development Austin Maestro), and was responsible for the building of a new styling studio at their Canley, Coventry plant; the former opened in 1982. He also recruited a new team. Early projects from the new studio included Project XX (the Rover 800) and the MG EX-E concept car. In 1991, Axe became head of the Warwick-based vehicle design consultancy Design Research Associates (DRA), which resulted from a management buyout of Rover's design studio in 1986. DRA was acquired by Arup in 1999.

The design had been initiated prior to his joining BL, but he was able to make last-minute changes to it shortly before it entered production. Cosmetic changes – which aimed to improve the by-then dated design – included black trim along the car's waist line. Due to BL's financial problems, the release of the Montego, and the related David Bache-designed Austin Maestro hatchback had been delayed by several years. ==Personal life== After selling DRA to Arup in 1999, Axe moved to Florida.

The following year he was in Florence with a CNR grant, later to become appointed as Professor. From 1967 to 1972 he taught at several prestigious universities in the United States, including Princeton, Harvard, and NYU. From 1974 to 1980 he was a staff member in the theory division of CERN, in Geneva. Preparata dedicated a great part of his scientific activity to high energy physics, giving fundamental contributions to the construction of the standard model, the new synthesis of the subnuclear interactions. In particular, he clarified the nature of the Dirac quantum field of quarks, a fundamental premise for the electroweak unification, and he proposed a solution to the crucial problem of colour confinement in quantum chromodynamics (QCD), based on a non-perturbative analysis of the ground state of QCD. His analysis reveals the existence of a non-trivial ground state of QCD and constitutes an important step forward in our understanding of interacting quantum fields. From 1987 his attention turned to problems in the field of condensed matter and to nuclear physics, that he tackled armed with the picture of Quantum Field Theory. Preparata discovered that condensed matter systems, when both at sufficiently low temperatures and high densities will spontaneously develop new coherent solutions of quantum electrodynamics (QED). This allowed him to face old problems, like liquid water theory, and new ones, like cold fusion, from a completely new point of view. Moreover, along with Cecilia Saccone (Molecular Biology Professor of University of Bari), Preparata developed a Markov model of molecular evolution. He published approximately 400 papers in such diverse fields as subnuclear physics, nuclear physics, physics of lasers, superconductivity, superfluidity, liquid and solid water, condensed matter (glasses, colloids, electrolytes, etc.), physics of neutron stars, astrophysics of Gamma ray bursts, and cold fusion. A fierce and stubborn character, Preparata often encountered open ostracism from his peers. He liked to reconnect his ideas in theoretical physics to those of Realism. In his last years he taught at the Department of Physics, University of Milan, Italy, where he was most influential on a generation of young physicists. He died in Frascati in 2000. ==The Giuliano Preparata Award== In 2003, a series of silver medals were minted to commemorate Giuliano Preparata. In June 2004, this stock of Giuliano Preparata Medals was donated to ISCMNS(The International Society for Condensed Matter Nuclear Science) which administers them through The Giuliano Preparata Award Committee. The \\"Awards\\" are presented to those individuals who are making or have made an outstanding contribution in the field of Condensed Matter Nuclear Science(CMNS). The \\"Awards\\" are also known as The International Society for Condensed Matter Nuclear Science Prizes.

When allergy symptoms occur, they can occur rapidly or have a gradual onset. The former may include anaphylaxis, a potentially life-threatening condition which requires treatment with epinephrine among other measures. The latter can take hours to days to appear, with symptoms including atopic dermatitis, inflammation of the esophagus, enteropathy involving the small intestine and proctocolitis involving the rectum and colon. In the United States, 90% of allergic responses to foods are caused by eight foods, with cow's milk being the most common. Recognition that a small number of foods are responsible for the majority of food allergies has led to requirements to prominently list these common allergens, including dairy, on food labels.\\"Food allergen labelling and information requirements under the EU Food Information for Consumers Regulation No. 1169/2011: Technical Guidance\\" (April 2015). One function of the immune system is to defend against infections by recognizing foreign proteins, but it should not over-react to food proteins. Heating milk proteins can cause them to become denatured, meaning to lose their 3-dimensional configuration, and thus lose allergenicity; for this reason dairy-containing baked goods may be tolerated while fresh milk triggers an allergic reaction. Management is by avoiding eating any dairy foods or foods that contain dairy ingredients. In people with rapid reactions (IgE-mediated milk allergy), the dose capable of provoking an allergic response can be as low as a few milligrams, so recommendations are to avoid dairy strictly. The declaration of the presence of trace amounts of milk or dairy in foods is not mandatory in any country, with the exception of Brazil. Milk allergy affects between 2% and 3% of babies and young children. To reduce risk, recommendations are that babies should be exclusively breastfed for at least four months, preferably six months, before introducing cow's milk. If there is a family history of dairy allergy, then soy infant formula can be considered, but about 10 to 15% of babies allergic to cow's milk will also react to soy. The majority of children outgrow milk allergy, but for about 0.4% the condition persists into adulthood. Oral immunotherapy is being researched, but it is of unclear benefit. ==Signs and symptoms== Food allergies can have rapid-onset (from minutes up to 2 hours), delayed-onset (up to 48 hours or even 1 week), or combinations of both, depending on the mechanisms involved. The difference depends on the types of white blood cells involved. B cells, a subset of white blood cells, rapidly synthesize and secrete immunoglobulin E (IgE), a class of antibody which bind to antigens, i.e., the foreign proteins. Thus, immediate reactions are described as IgE-mediated. The delayed reactions involve non-IgE-mediated immune mechanisms initiated by B cells, T cells, and other white blood cells. Unlike with IgE reactions, there are no specific biomarker molecules circulating in the blood, and so, confirmation is by removing the suspect food from the diet and see if the symptoms resolve. IgE- mediated symptoms include: rash, hives, itching of the mouth, lips, tongue, throat, eyes, skin, or other areas, swelling of the lips, tongue, eyelids, or the whole face, difficulty swallowing, runny or congested nose, hoarse voice, wheezing, shortness of breath, diarrhea, abdominal pain, lightheadedness, fainting, nausea and vomiting. Symptoms of allergies vary from person to person and may also vary from incident to incident. Serious danger regarding allergies can begin when the respiratory tract or blood circulation is affected. The former can be indicated by wheezing, a blocked airway and cyanosis, the latter by weak pulse, pale skin, and fainting. When these symptoms occur, the allergic reaction is called anaphylaxis. Anaphylaxis occurs when IgE antibodies are involved, and areas of the body that are not in direct contact with the food become affected and show severe symptoms. Untreated, this can proceed to vasodilation, a low blood pressure situation called anaphylactic shock, and very rarely, death. For milk allergy, non-IgE- mediated responses are more common than IgE-mediated. The presence of certain symptoms, such as angioedema or atopic eczema, is more likely related to IgE- mediated allergies, whereas non-IgE-mediated reactions manifest as gastrointestinal symptoms, without skin or respiratory symptoms. Within non- IgE cow's milk allergy, clinicians distinguish among food protein-induced enterocolitis syndrome (FPIES), food protein-induced allergic proctocolitis (FPIAP) and food protein-induced enteropathy (FPE). Common trigger foods for all are cow's milk and soy foods (including soy infant formula). FPIAP is considered to be at the milder end of the spectrum and is characterized by intermittent bloody stools. FPE is identified by chronic diarrhea which will resolve when the offending food is removed from the infant's diet. FPIES can be severe, characterized by persistent vomiting, 1 to 4 hours after an allergen-containing food is ingested, to the point of lethargy. Watery and sometimes bloody diarrhea can develop 5 to 10 hours after the triggering meal, to the point of dehydration and low blood pressure. Infants reacting to cow's milk may also react to soy formula, and vice versa. International consensus guidelines have been established for the diagnosis and treatment of FPIES. ==Mechanisms== Conditions caused by food allergies are classified into three groups according to the mechanism of the allergic response: # IgE-mediated (classic) – the most common type, manifesting as acute changes that occur shortly after eating, and may progress to anaphylaxis # Non-IgE mediated – characterized by an immune response not involving IgE; may occur hours to days after eating, complicating the diagnosis # IgE- and non-IgE-mediated – a hybrid of the above two types Allergic reactions are hyperactive responses of the immune system to generally innocuous substances, such as proteins in the foods we eat. Some proteins trigger allergic reactions while others do not. One theory is resistance to digestion, the thinking being that when largely intact proteins reach the small intestine the white blood cells involved in immune reactions will be activated.Food Reactions. Allergies . Foodreactions.org. Kent, England. 2005. Accessed 27 Apr 2010. The heat of cooking structurally degrades protein molecules, potentially making them less allergenic.Mayo Clinic. Causes of Food Allergies. April 2010. Allergic responses can be divided into two phases: an acute response that occurs immediately after exposure to an allergen, which can then either subside or progress into a \\"late-phase reaction,\\" prolonging the symptoms of a response and resulting in more tissue damage. In the early stages of acute allergic reaction, lymphocytes previously sensitized to a specific protein or protein fraction react by quickly producing a particular type of antibody known as secreted IgE (sIgE), which circulates in the blood and binds to IgE-specific receptors on the surface of other kinds of immune cells called mast cells and basophils. Both of these are involved in the acute inflammatory response. Activated mast cells and basophils undergo a process called degranulation, during which they release histamine and other inflammatory chemical mediators (cytokines, interleukins, leukotrienes, and prostaglandins) into the surrounding tissue causing several systemic effects, such as vasodilation, mucous secretion, nerve stimulation, and smooth muscle contraction. This results in runny nose, itchiness, shortness of breath, and potentially anaphylaxis. Depending on the individual, the allergen, and the mode of introduction, the symptoms can be system-wide (classical anaphylaxis), or localized to particular body systems; asthma is localized to the respiratory system, while eczema is localized to the skin. After the chemical mediators of the acute response subside, late-phase responses can often occur due to the migration of other white blood cells such as neutrophils, lymphocytes, eosinophils, and macrophages to the initial reaction sites. This is usually seen 2–24 hours after the original reaction. Cytokines from mast cells may also play a role in the persistence of long-term effects. Late-phase responses seen in asthma are slightly different from those seen in other allergic responses, although they are still caused by release of mediators from eosinophils. Six major allergenic proteins from cow's milk have been identified: αs1-, αs2-, β-, and κ-casein from casein proteins and α-lactalbumin and β-lactoglobulin from whey proteins. There is some cross- reactivity with soy protein, particularly in non-IgE mediated allergy. Heat can reduce allergenic potential, so dairy ingredients in baked goods may be less likely to trigger a reaction than milk or cheese. For milk allergy, non- IgE-mediated responses are more common than IgE-mediated. The former can manifest as atopic dermatitis and gastrointestinal symptoms, especially in infants and young children. Some will display both, so that a child could react to an oral food challenge with respiratory symptoms and hives (skin rash), followed a day or two later with a flare up of atopic dermatitis and gastrointestinal symptoms, including chronic diarrhea, blood in the stools, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), constipation, chronic vomiting and colic. ==Diagnosis== Skin prick testing for allergies. For a positive response, the skin will become red and raised. Diagnosis of milk allergy is based on the person's history of allergic reactions, skin prick test (SPT), patch test, and measurement of milk protein specific serum IgE. A negative IgE test does not rule out non-IgE-mediated allergy, also described as cell- mediated allergy. Confirmation is by double-blind, placebo-controlled food challenges, conducted by an allergy specialist. SPT and IgE have a sensitivity of around 88% but specificity of 68% and 48%, respectively, meaning these tests will probably detect a milk sensitivity but may also be false-positive for other allergens. Attempts have been made to identify SPT and IgE responses accurate enough to avoid the need for confirmation with an oral food challenge. A systematic review stated that in children younger than two years, cut-offs for specific IgE or SPT seem to be more homogeneous and may be proposed. For older children, the tests were less consistent. It concluded \\"None of the cut-offs proposed in the literature can be used to definitely confirm cow's milk allergy diagnosis, either to fresh pasteurized or to baked milk.\\" Differential diagnosis The symptoms of milk allergy can be confused with other disorders that present similar clinical features, such as lactose intolerance, infectious gastroenteritis, celiac disease, non-celiac gluten sensitivity, inflammatory bowel disease, eosinophilic gastroenteritis, and pancreatic insufficiency, among others. Lactose intolerance Hydrolysis of the disaccharide lactose to glucose and galactose Milk allergy is distinct from lactose intolerance, which is a nonallergic food sensitivity, due to the lack of the enzyme lactase in the small intestines to break lactose down into glucose and galactose. The unabsorbed lactose reaches the large intestine, where resident bacteria use it for fuel, releasing hydrogen, carbon dioxide and methane gases. These gases are the cause of abdominal pain and other symptoms. Lactose intolerance does not cause damage to the gastrointestinal tract. There are four types: primary, secondary, developmental, and congenital. Primary lactose intolerance is when the amount of lactase declines as people age. Secondary lactose intolerance is due to injury to the small intestine, such as from infection, celiac disease, inflammatory bowel disease, or other diseases. Developmental lactose intolerance may occur in premature babies and usually improves over a short period of time. Congenital lactose intolerance is an extremely rare genetic disorder in which little or no lactase is made from birth. ==Prevention== Research on prevention addresses the question of whether it is possible to reduce the risk of developing an allergy in the first place. Reviews concluded that there is no strong evidence to recommend changes to the diets of pregnant or nursing women as a means of preventing the development of food allergy in their infants. For mothers of infants considered at high risk of developing cow's milk allergy because of a family history, there is some evidence that the nursing mother avoiding allergens may reduce risk of the child developing eczema, but a Cochrane review concluded that more research is needed. Guidelines from various government and international organizations recommend that for the lowest allergy risk, infants be exclusively breastfed for 4–6 months. There does not appear to be any benefit to extending that period beyond six months. If a nursing mother decides to start feeding with an infant formula prior to four months the recommendation is to use a formula containing cow's milk proteins. A different consideration occurs when there is a family history – either parents or older siblings – of milk allergy. The three options to avoiding formula with intact cow's milk proteins are substituting a product containing either extensively hydrolyzed milk proteins, or a non-dairy formula, or one utilizing free amino acids. The hydrolyzation process breaks intact proteins into fragments, in theory reducing allergenic potential. In 2016, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved a label claim for hydrolyzed whey protein being hypoallergenic.Labeling of Infant Formula: Guidance for Industry U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2016) Accessed 11 December 2017. However, a meta-analysis published the same year disputed this claim, concluding that, based on dozens of clinical trials, there was insufficient evidence to support a claim that a partially hydrolyzed formula could reduce the risk of eczema. Soy formula is a common substitution, but infants with milk allergy may also have an allergic response to soy formula. Hydrolyzed rice formula is an option, as are the more expensive amino acid- based formulas. ==Treatment== The need for a dairy-free diet should be reevaluated every six months by testing milk-containing products low on the \\"milk ladder\\", such as fully cooked, i.e., baked foods, containing milk, in which the milk proteins have been denatured, and ending with fresh cheese and milk. Desensitization via oral immunotherapy is considered experimental. Treatment for accidental ingestion of milk products by allergic individuals varies depending on the sensitivity of the person. An antihistamine, such as diphenhydramine (Benadryl), may be prescribed. Sometimes prednisone will be prescribed to prevent a possible late-phase type I hypersensitivity reaction. Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis) may require treatment with an epinephrine pen, i.e., an injection device designed to be used by a non- healthcare professional when emergency treatment is warranted. A second dose is needed in 16–35% of episodes. Avoiding dairy Most people find it necessary to strictly avoid any item containing dairy ingredients. The reason is that the individual threshold dose capable of provoking an allergic reaction can be quite small, especially in infants. An estimated 5% react to less than 30 milligrams of dairy proteins, and 1% react to less than 1 milligram. A more recent review calculated that the eliciting threshold dose for an allergic reaction in 1% of people (ED01) with confirmed cow's milk allergy is 0.1 mg of cow's milk protein. Beyond the obvious (anything with milk, cheese, cream, curd, butter, ghee or yogurt in the name), in countries where allergen labeling is mandatory, the ingredient list is supposed to list all ingredients. Anyone with or caring for a person with a dairy protein allergy should always carefully read food package labels, as sometimes even a familiar brand undergoes an ingredient change. In the U.S., for all foods except meat, poultry and egg processed products and most alcoholic beverages, if an ingredient is derived from one of the required-label allergens, then it must either have the food name in parentheses, for example \\"Casein (milk),\\" or as an alternative, there must be a statement separate but adjacent to the ingredients list: \\"Contains milk\\" (and any other of the allergens with mandatory labeling). Dairy-sourced protein ingredients include casein, caseinates, whey and lactalbumin, among others. The U.S. FDA has a recall process for foods that contain undeclared allergenic ingredients. The University of Wisconsin has a list of foods that may contain dairy proteins, yet are not always obvious from the name or type of food. This list contains the following examples: * Bread, baked goods and desserts * Caramel and nougat candies * Cereals, crackers, food bars * Chewing gum * Chocolate ('milk' and 'dark') * \\"Cream of...\\" soups * Creamy pasta sauces * Creamy salad dressings * Eggnog * Flavored potato chips * Hot dogs and lunch meat * Instant mashed potatoes * Margarine * Medical food beverages * Non-dairy creamer * Sherbet * Pudding and custard There is a distinction between “Contains ___” and “May contain ___.” The first is a deliberate addition to the ingredients of a food, and is required. The second addresses unintentional possible inclusion of ingredients, in this instance dairy-sourced, during transportation, storage or at the manufacturing site, and is voluntary, and is referred to as precautionary allergen labeling (PAL). Milk from other mammalian species (goat, sheep, etc.) should not be used as a substitute for cow's milk, as milk proteins from other mammals are often cross-reactive. Nevertheless, some people with cow's milk allergy can tolerate goat's or sheep's milk, and vice versa. Milk from camels, pigs, reindeer, horses, and donkeys may also be tolerated in some cases. Probiotic products have been tested, and some found to contain milk proteins which were not always indicated on the labels. Cross-reactivity with soy Infants – either still 100% breastfeeding or on infant formula – and also young children may be prone to a combined cow's milk and soy protein allergy, referred to as \\"milk soy protein intolerance\\" (MSPI). A U.S. state government website presents the concept, including a recommendation that nursing mothers discontinue eating any foods that contain dairy or soy ingredients. In opposition to this recommendation, a published scientific review stated that there was not yet sufficient evidence in the human trial literature to conclude that maternal dietary food avoidance during lactation would prevent or treat allergic symptoms in breastfed infants. A review presented information on milk allergy, soy allergy and cross-reactivity between the two. Milk allergy was described as occurring in 2.2% to 2.8% of infants and declining with age. Soy allergy was described as occurring in zero to 0.7% of young children. According to several studies cited in the review, between 10% and 14% of infants and young children with confirmed cow's milk allergy were determined to also be sensitized to soy and in some instances have a clinical reaction after consuming a soy-containing food. The research did not address whether the cause was two separate allergies or a cross- reaction due to a similarity in protein structure, as which occurs for cow's milk and goat's milk. Recommendations are that infants diagnosed as allergic to cow's milk infant formula be switched to an extensively hydrolyzed protein formula rather than a soy whole protein formula. ==Prognosis== Milk allergy typically presents in the first year of life. The majority of children outgrow milk allergy by the age of ten years. One large clinical trial reported resolutions of 19% by age 4 years, 42% by age 8 years, 64% by age 12 years, and 79% by 16 years. Children are often better able to tolerate milk as an ingredient in baked goods relative to liquid milk. Childhood predictors for adult-persistence are anaphylaxis, high milk-specific serum IgE, robust response to the skin prick test and absence of tolerance to milk-containing baked foods. Resolution was more likely if baseline serum IgE was lower, or if IgE-mediated allergy was absent so that all that was present was cell- mediated, non-IgE allergy. People with confirmed cow's milk allergy may also demonstrate an allergic response to beef, more so to rare beef versus well- cooked beef. The offending protein appears to be bovine serum albumin. Milk allergy has consequences. In a U.S. government diet and health surveys conducted in 2007–2010, 6,189 children ages 2–17 years were assessed. For those classified as cow's milk allergic at the time of the survey, mean weight, height, and body-mass index were significantly lower than their non- allergic peers. This was not true for children with other food allergies. Diet assessment showed a significant 23% reduction of calcium intake and near- significant trends for lower vitamin D and total calorie intake. ==Epidemiology== The percentage of babies in developed countries with milk allergy is between 2% and 3%. This estimate is for antibody-based allergy; figures for allergy based on cellular immunity are unknown. The percentage declines as children get older. National survey data in the U.S. collected from 2005–2006 showed that from age six and older, the percentage with IgE- confirmed milk allergy was under 0.4%. For all age groups, a review conducted in Europe estimated 0.6% had milk allergy. ==Society and culture== Dairy allergy was one of the earliest food allergies to be recorded. An ancient Greek medical text attributed to the doctor Hippocrates ( 460 – 370 BC) notes in the context of a description of how some foods are harmful to certain individuals but not others, \\"...cheese does not harm all men alike; some can eat their fill of it without the slightest hurt, nay, those it agrees with are wonderfully strengthened thereby. Others come off badly.\\" The text attempts to explain the reaction to the cheese in terms of Hippocratic humorism, stating that some constitutions are naturally \\"hostile to cheese, and [are] roused and stirred to action under its influence.\\" With the passage of mandatory labeling laws, food allergy awareness has definitely increased, with impacts on the quality of life for children, their parents and their immediate caregivers. In the U.S., the Food Allergen Labeling and Consumer Protection Act of 2004 (FALPA) causes people to be reminded of allergy problems every time they handle a food package, and restaurants have added allergen warnings to menus. School systems have protocols about what foods can be brought into the school. Despite all these precautions, people with serious allergies are aware that accidental exposure can easily occur at other peoples' houses, at school or in restaurants. Food fear has a significant impact on quality of life. Finally, for children with allergies, their quality of life is also affected by actions of their peers. There is an increased occurrence of bullying, which can include threats or acts of deliberately being touched with foods they need to avoid, also having their allergen-free food deliberately contaminated. Regulation of labeling An example of a list of allergens in a food item In response to the risk that certain foods pose to those with food allergies, some countries have responded by instituting labeling laws that require food products to clearly inform consumers if their products contain major allergens or byproducts of major allergens among the ingredients intentionally added to foods. Nevertheless, there are no labeling laws to mandatory declare the presence of trace amounts in the final product as a consequence of cross- contamination, except in Brazil. Ingredients intentionally added In the U.S., the FALPA requires companies to disclose on the label whether a packaged food product contains a major food allergen added intentionally: cow's milk, peanuts, eggs, shellfish, fish, tree nuts, soy and wheat. This list originated in 1999 from the World Health Organisation Codex Alimentarius Commission. To meet FALCPA labeling requirements, if an ingredient is derived from one of the required-label allergens, then it must either have its \\"food sourced name\\" in parentheses, for example \\"Casein (milk),\\" or as an alternative, there must be a statement separate but adjacent to the ingredients list: \\"Contains milk\\" (and any other of the allergens with mandatory labeling). Dairy food listing is also mandatory in the European Union and more than a dozen other countries. FALCPA applies to packaged foods regulated by the FDA, which does not include poultry, most meats, certain egg products, and most alcoholic beverages. However, some meat, poultry, and egg processed products may contain allergenic ingredients, such as added milk proteins. These products are regulated by the Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS), which requires that any ingredient be declared in the labeling only by its common or usual name. Neither the identification of the source of a specific ingredient in a parenthetical statement nor the use of statements to alert for the presence of specific ingredients, like \\"Contains: milk\\", are mandatory according to FSIS. In the U.S., there is no federal mandate to address the presence of allergens in drug products. FALCPA does not apply to medicines nor to cosmetics. FALCPA also does not apply to food prepared in restaurants. Trace amounts as a result of cross-contamination The value of allergen labeling other than for intentional ingredients is controversial. This concerns labeling for ingredients present unintentionally as a consequence of cross-contact or cross-contamination at any point along the food chain (during raw material transportation, storage or handling, due to shared equipment for processing and packaging, etc.). Experts in this field propose that if allergen labeling is to be useful to consumers, and healthcare professionals who advise and treat those consumers, ideally there should be agreement on which foods require labeling, threshold quantities below which labeling may be of no purpose, and validation of allergen detection methods to test and potentially recall foods that were deliberately or inadvertently contaminated. Labeling regulations have been modified to provide for mandatory labeling of ingredients plus voluntary labeling, termed precautionary allergen labeling (PAL), also known as \\"may contain\\" statements, for possible, inadvertent, trace amount, cross-contamination during production. PAL labeling can be confusing to consumers, especially as there can be many variations on the wording of the warning. , PAL is regulated only in Switzerland, Japan, Argentina, and South Africa. Argentina decided to prohibit precautionary allergen labeling since 2010, and instead puts the onus on the manufacturer to control the manufacturing process and label only those allergenic ingredients known to be in the products. South Africa does not permit the use of PAL, except when manufacturers demonstrate the potential presence of allergen due to cross-contamination through a documented risk assessment despite adherence to Good Manufacturing Practice. In Australia and New Zealand, there is a recommendation that PAL be replaced by guidance from VITAL 2.0 (Vital Incidental Trace Allergen Labelling). A review identified \\"the eliciting dose for an allergic reaction in 1% of the population\\" as 0.01 mg for cow's milk. This threshold reference dose (and similar results for egg, peanut and other proteins) will provide food manufacturers with guidance for developing precautionary labelling and give consumers a better idea of what might be accidentally in a food product beyond \\"may contain.\\" VITAL 2.0 was developed by the Allergen Bureau, a food industry-sponsored, non-government organization.The VITAL Program Allergen Bureau, Australia and New Zealand. The EU has initiated a process to create labeling regulations for unintentional contamination but it is not expected to be published before 2024. Lack of compliance with labeling regulations is also a problem. As an example, the FDA documented failure to list milk as an ingredient in dark chocolate bars. The FDA tested 94 dark chocolate bars for the presence of milk. Only six listed milk as an ingredient, but of the remaining 88, the FDA found that 51 of them actually did contain milk proteins. Many of those did have PAL wording such as \\"may contain dairy.\\" Others claimed to be \\"dairy free\\" or \\"vegan\\" but still tested positive for cow's milk proteins. In Brazil, since April 2016, the declaration of the possibility of cross-contamination is mandatory when the product does not intentionally add any allergenic food or its derivatives, but the Good Manufacturing Practices and allergen control measures adopted are not sufficient to prevent the presence of accidental trace amounts. Milk of all species of mammalians is included among these allergenic foods. ==Research== Desensitization, which is a slow process of consuming tiny amounts of the allergenic protein until the body is able to tolerate more significant exposure, results in reduced symptoms or even remission of the allergy in some people and is being explored for treatment of milk allergy. This is called oral immunotherapy (OIT). Sublingual immunotherapy, in which the allergenic protein is held in the mouth under the tongue, has been approved for grass and ragweed allergies, but not yet for foods.http://acaai.org/allergies/allergy- treatment/allergy-immunotherapy/sublingual-immunotherapy-slit/ Sublingual Therapy (SLIT) American College of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology Oral desensitization for cow's milk allergy appears to be relatively safe and may be effective, however further studies are required to understand the overall immune response, and questions remain open about duration of the desensitization. There is research – not specific to milk allergy – on the use of probiotics, prebiotics and the combination of the two (synbiotics) as a means of treating or preventing infant and child allergies. From reviews, there appears to be a treatment benefit for eczema, but not asthma, wheezing or rhinoconjunctivitis. Several reviews concluded that the evidence is sufficient for it to be recommended in clinical practice. == See also == * Lactose intolerance * List of allergens (food and non-food) * Plant milk == References  External links == * Milk Allergy at Food Allergy Initiative Category:Milk Category:Food allergies ","title":"Milk allergy"},{"id":"5558525","text":"The Pan-Philippine Highway, also known as the Maharlika Highway (; ) is a network of roads, expressways, bridges, and ferry services that connect the islands of Luzon, Samar, Leyte, and Mindanao in the Philippines, serving as the country's principal transport backbone. It is the longest highway in the Philippines that forms the country's north–south backbone component of the National Route 1 (N1) of the Philippine highway network. The entire highway is designated as Asian Highway 26 (AH26) of the Asian Highway Network. The northern terminus of the highway is in Laoag and the southern terminus is in Zamboanga City. ==Development== The highway was proposed in 1965, and built under the administration of President Ferdinand Marcos. Government planners believed that the motorway and other connected roads would stimulate agricultural production by reducing transport costs, encourage social and economic development outside existing major urban centres such as Manila, and expand industrial production for domestic and overseas markets. Construction was supported by loans and grants from foreign aid institutions, including the World Bank. The highway was rehabilitated and improved in 1997, during the administration of President Fidel Ramos, with assistance from the Japanese government, and dubbed the \\"Philippine-Japan Friendship Highway\\". In 1998, the Department of Tourism designated 35 sections of the highway as \\"Scenic Highways\\", with developed amenities for travelers and tourists. In March 2018, Public Works and Highways Secretary Mark Villar inaugurated the arterial road that will link the North Luzon Expressway (NLEX) with the Maharlika Highway that traverses the central part of Luzon. ==Asian Highway Network== The Pan- Philippine Highway is designated as AH26 in the Asian Highway Network, a cooperative project which seeks to improve highway systems and standards across the continent. It is currently the only highway in the system that is isolated from every other highway; island-based sections of the Asian Highway Network in Japan (AH1), Sri Lanka (AH43) and Indonesia (AH2) are all linked to the mainland sections by ferries to South Korea (AH1), India (Dhanushkodi), and Singapore, respectively. ==Associated Routes== EDSA in Quezon City E2/AH26 Reassurance Marker along South Luzon Expressway in Muntinlupa Santa Cruz, Davao del Sur AH26 runs along the following thoroughfares: * 30px Manila North Road/Maharlika Highway: Laoag – Aparri * 30px Bangag-Magapit Road: Aparri – Lal-lo * 30px Cagayan Valley Road: Lal-lo – Tuguegarao * 30px Maharlika Highway: San Pablo – Ilagan – Santiago – Solano – Bayombong – San Jose City – Cabanatuan – Gapan – San Miguel – Baliuag – Pulilan – Guiguinto * 30px North Luzon Expressway: Santa Rita Interchange, Guiguinto – Balintawak Interchange, Quezon City (partially signed as AH26) * 30px EDSA (Eastern Route): Balintawak Interchange, Quezon City – Magallanes Interchange, Makati (around Metro Manila) * 30px South Luzon Expressway: Magallanes Interchange, Makati – Calamba Exit, Calamba (partially signed as AH26) ** 30px Skyway * 30px Maharlika Highway: Calamba – Santo Tomas – San Pablo – Tiaong – Candelaria – Sariaya – Lucena * 30px Lucena Diversion Road: Lucena * 30px Maharlika Highway: Lucena – Pagbilao – Gumaca - Calauag – Daet – Milaor – Naga City – Daraga – Sorsogon City – Matnog * 30px Matnog–Allen ferry line: Luzon – Visayas (via San Bernardino Strait) * 30px Maharlika Highway: Allen – Calbayog – Catbalogan – Tacloban – Palo – Mahaplag – Liloan * 30px Liloan–Lipata ferry line: Visayas – Mindanao (via Bohol Sea) * 30px Maharlika Highway: Surigao City – Kitcharao * 30px Surigao-Butuan National Highway: Kitcharao – Butuan * 30px Davao-Agusan National Highway: Butuan – Bayugan – Tagum – Davao City * 30px C.M.

In 1926 he lost his eyesight because of glaucoma.Barlow, William (1989). \\"Looking Up At Down\\": The Emergence of Blues Culture, pp. 267–268. Philadelphia: Temple University Press. .

In 1960 he was \\"rediscovered\\" and recorded by Pete Welding of Testament Records, but the recordings from this session were never released. Darby was a friend of the blues musician Peetie Wheatstraw. On December 21, 1941, Wheatstraw's 39th birthday, Darby was invited to go for a drive with Wheatstraw and two others, but Darby's wife objected, and he declined the invitation. Wheatstraw and his two companions were killed when their car struck a standing freight train.Garon, Paul (1971). The Devil's Son-in-Law: The Story of Peetie Wheatstraw and His Songs.

He worked notably in the French \\"avant-garde\\" in 1972–1974 in the Maison de la Culture of Orléans. A former professor in both Geneva (from 1975) and Neuchâtel, he pursued a tradition led by Béla Bartók, Arnold Schoenberg and Olivier Messiaen, and over time developed a personal style embracing electronics and the media, poetry, visual art (specifically that by Paul Klee), and literature in a specific spatial, timbral and philosophical inquiry on music.

Date accessed: 27 November 2011 ==Parliamentary career== In 1621 Goodwin was elected Member of Parliament for Wycombe. He was re- elected MP for Wycombe in 1624. In 1626, he was elected MP for Aylesbury. In April 1640, Goodwin was elected with his friend John Hampden as MP for Buckinghamshire in the Short Parliament. He was re-elected MP for Buckinghamshire in November 1640 for the Long Parliament. Goodwin was a strong Parliamentarian and Puritan and opposed many of the policies of Charles I of England. When open war broke out between Parliament and the King, he gave substantial sums to the Parliamentarian cause, and commanded a cavalry regiment. ==Civil war== Goodwin took part at the Battle of Edgehill and Turnham Green. However, he was primarily active on his home ground in Buckinghamshire and the surrounding counties. In August 1642, he joined Hampden and Bulstrode Whitelocke to capture the Earl of Berkshire, who had been attempting to execute a commission of array in Oxfordshire for the King. Hampden and Goodwin also captured the Earl of Northampton at Daventry that year. Goodwin was appointed Parliamentary commander-in-chief of Buckinghamshire in January 1643, and made an unsuccessful attempt to seize Brill. While harrying Prince Rupert's troops after the siege of Reading, Hampden was wounded at Chalgrove Field on 18 June 1643. Although it is often reported (by who) that Goodwin persuaded Hampden to leave the field and ride to Thame, where he died on 24 June there is no firm evidence that Goodwin even took part in the battle.

He was educated at Franckesche StiftungenFranckesche StiftungenArchiv der Franckeschen Stiftungen, AFSt/S B I 94, 575-577 in Halle starting in 1763 and in 1769 at the University of Halle. He returned to Pennsylvania in September 1770 and was ordained as a Lutheran minister. He served first in Pennsylvania and then as a pastor in New Jersey. He received a Doctor of Divinity degree from Princeton University. He served as the pastor of Holy Trinity Church in Lancaster, Pennsylvania from 1780 through 1815. In 1787, he was also made the first president of Franklin College. 1779 he retired and devoted himself to the study of botany. He is best known as a botanist. Muhlenbergia, a well-known genus of grasses, was named in his honor. His chief works are Catalogus Plantarum Americae Septentrionalis (1813) and Descriptio Uberior Graminum et Plantarum Calamariarum Americae Septentrionalis Indiginarum et Cicurum (1817). Muhlenberg discovered and identified the bog turtle while conducting a survey of plants in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania. In 1801 the turtle was named Clemmys muhlenbergii in his honor,Beolens, Bo; Watkins, Michael; Grayson, Michael (2011). The Eponym Dictionary of Reptiles.

However, the species' common name was changed to bog turtle in 1956, as the practice of naming an organism's common name after individuals became less popular. Muhlenberg is buried in Woodward Hill Cemetery in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. ==Family== Muhlenberg was the brother of Frederick and Peter Muhlenberg, father of Henry A. P.

Shapiro in 1954. ==Statement of the inequality== Suppose n is a natural number and x_1, x_2, \\\\dots, x_n are positive numbers and: * n is even and less than or equal to 12, or * n is odd and less than or equal to 23. Then the Shapiro inequality states that :\\\\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\\\frac{x_i}{x_{i+1}+x_{i+2}} \\\\geq \\\\frac{n}{2} where x_{n+1}=x_1, x_{n+2}=x_2. For greater values of n the inequality does not hold and the strict lower bound is \\\\gamma \\\\frac{n}{2} with \\\\gamma \\\\approx 0.9891\\\\dots. The initial proofs of the inequality in the pivotal cases n=12 (Godunova and Levin, 1976) and n=23 (Troesch, 1989) rely on numerical computations. In 2002, P.J. Bushell and J.B. McLeod published an analytical proof for n=12. The value of \\\\gamma was determined in 1971 by Vladimir Drinfeld. Specifically, he proved that the strict lower bound \\\\gamma is given by \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\psi(0), where the function \\\\psi is the convex hull of f(x)=e^{-x} and g(x) = \\\\frac{2}{e^x+e^{\\\\frac{x}{2}}}.

Transcription coregulators that activate gene transcription are referred to as coactivators while those that repress are known as corepressors. The mechanism of action of transcription coregulators is to modify chromatin structure and thereby make the associated DNA more or less accessible to transcription. In humans several dozen to several hundred coregulators are known, depending on the level of confidence with which the characterisation of a protein as a coregulator can be made. One class of transcription coregulators modifies chromatin structure through covalent modification of histones. A second ATP dependent class modifies the conformation of chromatin. ==Histone acetyltransferases == Nuclear DNA is normally tightly wrapped around histones rendering the DNA inaccessible to the general transcription machinery and hence this tight association prevents transcription of DNA. At physiological pH, the phosphate component of the DNA backbone is deprotonated which gives DNA a net negative charge. Histones are rich in lysine residues which at physiological pH are protonated and therefore positively charged. The electrostatic attraction between these opposite charges is largely responsible for the tight binding of DNA to histones. Many coactivator proteins have intrinsic histone acetyltransferase (HAT) catalytic activity or recruit other proteins with this activity to promoters. These HAT proteins are able to acetylate the amine group in the sidechain of histone lysine residues which makes lysine much less basic, not protonated at physiological pH, and therefore neutralizes the positive charges in the histone proteins. This charge neutralization weakens the binding of DNA to histones causing the DNA to unwind from the histone proteins and thereby significantly increases the rate of transcription of this DNA. Many corepressors can recruit histone deacetylase (HDAC) enzymes to promoters. These enzymes catalyze the hydrolysis of acetylated lysine residues restoring the positive charge to histone proteins and hence the tie between histone and DNA. PELP-1 can act as a transcriptional corepressor for transcription factors in the nuclear receptor family such as glucocorticoid receptors. Nuclear receptor coactivators Nuclear receptors bind to coactivators in a ligand- dependent manner. A common feature of nuclear receptor coactivators is that they contain one or more LXXLL binding motifs (a contiguous sequence of 5 amino acids where L = leucine and X = any amino acid) referred to as NR (nuclear receptor) boxes. The LXXLL binding motifs have been shown by X-ray crystallography to bind to a groove on the surface of ligand binding domain of nuclear receptors. Examples include: * ARA (androgen receptor associated protein) ** ARA54 () ** ARA55 () ** ARA70 () * AIRE * BCAS3 (breast carcinoma amplified sequence 3) * CREB-binding protein * CRTC (CREB regulated transcription coactivator) ** CRTC1 () ** CRTC2 () ** CRTC3 () * CARM1 (coactivator-associated arginine methyltransferase 1) * Nuclear receptor coactivator (NCOA) ** NCOA1/SRC-1 (steroid receptor coactivator-1)/ ** NCOA2/GRIP1 (glucocorticoid receptor interacting protein 1)/ TIF2 (transcriptional intermediary factor 2) ** NCOA3/AIB1 (amplified in breast) ** NCOA4/ARA70 (androgen receptor associated protein 70) ** NCOA5 () ** NCOA6 () ** NCOA7 () * p300 * PCAF (p300/CBP associating factor) * PGC1 (proliferator activated receptor gamma coactivator 1) ** PPARGC1A () ** PPARGC1B () * PNRC (proline-rich nuclear receptor coactivator 1) ** PNRC1 () ** PNRC2 () Nuclear receptor corepressors Corepressor proteins also bind to the surface of the ligand binding domain of nuclear receptors, but through a LXXXIXXX(I/L) motif of amino acids (where L = leucine, I = isoleucine and X = any amino acid).

Jindabyne was filmed entirely on location in and around the Australian country town of the same name: Jindabyne, New South Wales, situated next to the Snowy Mountains. It was one of a rush of over 16 Australian cinema releases that year.https://www.smh.com.au/news/film/jindabyne-leads-rush-of- homegrown-movies/2006/07/15/1152637924274.html Critics praised its refinement and the film is credited as a signal of Australian cinema's maturity. The screenplay was written by Beatrix Christian, and was adapted from the late American short story writer and poet Raymond Carver's 1975 title, \\"So Much Water So Close to Home\\". The short story was the basis for a segment in Robert Altman's Short Cuts (1993). Carver's story had also been retold in music by Australian artist Paul Kelly in the song \\"Everything's Turning to White\\", on his 1989 album So Much Water So Close to Home. Kelly contributed to the score of the 2006 film as well. Jindabyne had its world premiere at the 2006 Cannes Film Festival and its North American premiere at the 2006 Toronto International Film Festival. The film was released in Australia on 20 July 2006 and was released in the United States on 27 April 2007. Its production budget was reportedly $10.8 million.https://www.the- numbers.com/movie/Jindabyne#tab=summary ==Plot== On an annual fishing trip, in isolated high country, Stewart (Gabriel Byrne), Carl (John Howard), Rocco (Stelios Yiakmis) and Billy (Simon Stone) find a girl's body in the river; she has been brutally murdered by Gregory (Chris Haywood), a local electrician. The girl (Tatea Reilly) turns out subsequently to be Aboriginal. The discovery shocks and confuses the men. Only the youngest of the men, Billy, understands this is a crime scene but he is ignored. Billy later leaves the town with his partner and child. The men initially suggest hiking back the following morning as it is too late in the day to safely navigate their way to their trucks. Stewart secures the girl's body by the ankle to the riverbank, so she will not drift downstream and get lost in the rapids. However, Stewart the next day goes fishing and, after catching an especially large fish, the men decide to spend the rest of the afternoon continuing their trip before informing the police in the morning. While the men are gone, some of the men's wives (Jude and Claire) and Rocco's girlfriend (Carmel), get together socially. During their conversation, Jude (Carl's wife) reveals that their daughter died nearly two years ago, leaving them to raise their granddaughter Caylin-Calandria, who has psychological issues and towards whom Jude shows resentment. When Stewart's wife, Claire (Laura Linney) remarks that she does not think Stewart would want more children, Jude reveals that Claire had a mental breakdown after her son Tom was born and left the family for 18 months. The men return home late Sunday night. After reporting the body to the police, they each go to their respective homes. Stewart goes home to Claire and finds her sleeping on her stomach, reminiscent of the posture of the dead body. He talks to her briefly and initiates intimacy. However, he does not disclose the find, which later causes problems when Claire finds out he left the girl's body to keep fishing. The next morning, the police show up at Claire and Stewart's house to ask Stewart to answer some more questions. The men gather in the police station, where the police officer expresses his disgust that they would \\"fish over a dead body\\" instead of reporting it as soon as they could. Claire is stunned that Stewart would do such a thing and keeps trying to understand his reasons. The men come up with a story that Carl strained his ankle thus they could not walk back as early as they would have otherwise. Because the girl was Aboriginal, some believe the men neglected the dead girl out of racism. All of the men's businesses are vandalised in retaliation by Aboriginals, with painted slurs branding them racists. It becomes clear from this point that the western culture of a town that had to be abandoned and rebuilt on higher ground because of a dam and which is peopled by immigrants, is at odds with the ancient belief system of the native Aboriginals. Claire and Elissa (Billy's partner) are the only ones of the group who express any remorse and condemnation for what happened. Jude repeatedly defends her husband Carl, while Carl argues that the girl was already dead and thus it made no difference to her whether they stayed or not. The more Claire pushes Stewart and the others to make amends, the more tensions increase in the town. Prior to the fishing trip, Claire had begun throwing up repeatedly from morning sickness, which she hid from everyone. With her marriage unravelling, and haunted by her post-post-partum breakdown and abandonment of her first child, she inquires of a medical professional about how to get an abortion. However, she has still not gone through with it - nor revealed her pregnancy to Stewart - by the end of the film. Despite encountering hostility from the rest of the group, Claire continues to try to reach out to the girl's family. She gathers donations to give to the girl's family for her funeral. Claire even goes to the family's home and is rebuked. She later returns to give them the money she has gathered. Increasingly troubled that Claire continues to probe for the truth of what happened, Stewart erupts in rage one evening when Claire asks him to talk about it. The two begin fighting physically, while slinging barbs at each other about their past mistakes. The next day, after Billy and his family have left town for the coast, Stewart tells Claire - who he suspects is planning to leave him - that he will never allow her to take his son from him. Carl similarly stands up for Caylin-Calandria after Jude once again shows anger towards her, saying she cannot take her pain of losing their daughter out on their blameless granddaughter. The next day, Claire goes to the memorial service. The rest of the men and their wives, as well as the children, show up to pay their respects, too. When Stewart apologises on behalf of the men, the girl's father throws dirt on him, spits on the ground and walks away, but there are no further objections to their presence. Stewart also asks Claire to come home. Throughout the movie, the murdering electrician continuously pops up around the characters, and even attends the memorial service. He is never caught. ==Cast== *Laura Linney as Claire *Gabriel Byrne as Stewart *Deborra-Lee Furness as Jude *John Howard as Carl *Chris Haywood as Gregory *Leah Purcell as Carmel *Eva Lazzaro as Caylin-Calandria *Sean Rees- Wemyss as Tom *Alice Garner as Elissa *Stelios Yiakmis as Rocco *Simon Stone as Billy *Betty Lucas as Vanessa *Tatea Reilly as Susan *Riley von Husen as Trout ==Reception== Although Jindabyne was apparently not commercially successful, it won significant critical acclaim midst mixed reviews. The film was a limited release and was rated \\"M\\" in Australia and \\"R\\" in the U.S. for \\"disturbing images, language and some nudity.\\" Box office earnings totalled just over $6 million. The Age hailed it as \\"easily one of the most engrossing, thoughtful, adult-oriented big-screen dramas produced in Australia for 20 years.\\" However, A. O. Scott of The New York Times wrote that \\"The real flaw is that the movie's best features -- the aching clarity of its central performances - threaten to be lost in a wilderness of metaphor and mystification.\\" The film won multiple awards and many nominations both in Australia and overseas. On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 65%, based on 100 reviews, and an average rating of 5.6/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \\"Jindabynes disparate themes may not quite cohere, but the film features fine performances from Linney and Byrne.\\" ==Festivals== * 2006 – France – Cannes Film Festival * 2006 – UK – Edinburgh International Film Festival * 2006 – Canada – Toronto International Film Festival * 2006 – Spain – Valladolid International Film Festival * 2007 – Ireland – Jameson Dublin International Film Festival ==Awards and honours== Won: * 2006 Film Critics Circle of Australia Awards: Best Director, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Cinematography, Best Actress in a Supporting Role (Deborra-Lee Furness). * 2006 Valladolid International Film Festival: Best Actress (Laura Linney), Best Music. * 2006 Stockholm Film Festival: Best Manuscript (by Beatrix Christian), FIPRESCI Prize for Best Film. * 2006 Aria Fine Arts Award: Best Soundtrack (Australia) * 2006 Australian Screen Sound Guild Awards: Best Achievement in Sound for Film Sound Recording, Best Achievement in Sound for Film Sound Mixing, Feature Film Soundtrack of the Year. * 2006 Edinburgh Film Festival: Herald Angel Award Nominated: * 2006 Australian Film Institute Awards: Best Film, Best Direction, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Cinematography, Best Sound, Best Original Music Score, Best Actor in a Lead Role (Gabriel Byrne), Best Actress in a Lead Role (Laura Linney), Best Actress in a Supporting Role (Deborra-Lee Furness). * 2006 IF Awards: Best Director, Best Actress (Laura Linney), Best Actor (Gabriel Byrne), Best Cinematography. * 2006 Film Critics Circle of Australia Awards: Best Film, Best Actress in a Lead Role (Laura Linney), Best Actor in a Supporting Role (John Howard), Best Music Score. * 2006 Valladolid International Film Festival: Golden Spike (Ray Lawrence). * 2006 Australian Screen Sound Guild Awards: Best Achievement in Sound For Film Sound Recording, Best Achievement in Sound for Film Sound Design, Best Achievement in Sound for Film Sound Mixing, Feature Film Soundtrack of the Year. ==Box office== Jindabyne grossed $400,438 in Australia and $5,643,674 overseas for a total of just over $6 million.https://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=jindabyne.htm ==See also== *Cinema of Australia ==ReferencesExternal links== *Jindabyne official website * *The Director Interviews: Ray Lawrence, Jindabyne at Filmmaker Magazine *Jindabyne at the National Film and Sound Archive Category:ARIA Award-winning albums Category:Australian films Category:Australian drama films Category:Films based on short fiction Category:2006 films Category:English-language films Category:Films directed by Ray Lawrence Category:Films scored by Paul Kelly (Australian musician) Category:Sony Pictures Classics films Category:Films set in New South Wales Category:2006 drama films es:Jindabyne nl:Jindabyne ","title":"Jindabyne (film)"},{"id":"5558617","text":"The BLOSUM62 matrix In bioinformatics, the BLOSUM (BLOcks SUbstitution Matrix) matrix is a substitution matrix used for sequence alignment of proteins. BLOSUM matrices are used to score alignments between evolutionarily divergent protein sequences. They are based on local alignments. BLOSUM matrices were first introduced in a paper by Steven Henikoff and Jorja Henikoff. They scanned the BLOCKS database for very conserved regions of protein families (that do not have gaps in the sequence alignment) and then counted the relative frequencies of amino acids and their substitution probabilities. Then, they calculated a log-odds score for each of the 210 possible substitution pairs of the 20 standard amino acids. All BLOSUM matrices are based on observed alignments; they are not extrapolated from comparisons of closely related proteins like the PAM Matrices. ==Biological background== The genetic instructions of every replicating cell in a living organism are contained within its DNA. Throughout the cell's lifetime, this information is transcribed and replicated by cellular mechanisms to produce proteins or to provide instructions for daughter cells during cell division, and the possibility exists that the DNA may be altered during these processes. This is known as a mutation. At the molecular level, there are regulatory systems that correct most — but not all — of these changes to the DNA before it is replicated. The functionality of a protein is highly dependent on its structure. Changing a single amino acid in a protein may reduce its ability to carry out this function, or the mutation may even change the function that the protein carries out. Changes like these may severely impact a crucial function in a cell, potentially causing the cell — and in extreme cases, the organism — to die. Conversely, the change may allow the cell to continue functioning albeit differently, and the mutation can be passed on to the organism's offspring. If this change does not result in any significant physical disadvantage to the offspring, the possibility exists that this mutation will persist within the population. The possibility also exists that the change in function becomes advantageous. The 20 amino acids translated by the genetic code vary greatly by the physical and chemical properties of their side chains. However, these amino acids can be categorised into groups with similar physicochemical properties. Substituting an amino acid with another from the same category is more likely to have a smaller impact on the structure and function of a protein than replacement with an amino acid from a different category. Sequence alignment is a fundamental research method for modern biology. The most common sequence alignment for protein is to look for similarity between different sequences in order to infer function or establish evolutionary relationships. This helps researchers better understand the origin and function of genes through the nature of homology and conservation. Substitution matrices are utilized in algorithms to calculate the similarity of different sequences of proteins; however, the utility of Dayhoff Matrix has decreased over time due to the requirement of sequences with a similarity more than 85%. In order to fill in this gap, Henikoff and Henikoff introduced BLOSUM (BLOcks SUbstitution Matrix) matrix which led to marked improvements in alignments and in searches using queries from each of the groups of related proteins. ==Terminology== BLOSUM: Blocks Substitution Matrix, a substitution matrix used for sequence alignment of proteins. Scoring metrics (statistical versus biological): When evaluating a sequence alignment, one would like to know how meaningful it is. This requires a scoring matrix, or a table of values that describes the probability of a biologically meaningful amino-acid or nucleotide residue-pair occurring in an alignment. Scores for each position are obtained frequencies of substitutions in blocks of local alignments of protein sequences. Several sets of BLOSUM matrices exist using different alignment databases, named with numbers. BLOSUM matrices with high numbers are designed for comparing closely related sequences, while those with low numbers are designed for comparing distant related sequences. For example, BLOSUM80 is used for closely related alignments, and BLOSUM45 is used for more distantly related alignments. The matrices were created by merging (clustering) all sequences that were more similar than a given percentage into one single sequence and then comparing those sequences (that were all more divergent than the given percentage value) only; thus reducing the contribution of closely related sequences. The percentage used was appended to the name, giving BLOSUM80 for example where sequences that were more than 80% identical were clustered. BLOSUM r: the matrix built from blocks with less than r% of similarity – E.g., BLOSUM62 is the matrix built using sequences with less than 62% similarity (sequences with ≥ 62% identity were clustered) – Note: BLOSUM 62 is the default matrix for protein BLAST. Experimentation has shown that the BLOSUM-62 matrix is among the best for detecting most weak protein similarities. ==Construction of BLOSUM matrices== BLOSUM matrices are obtained by using blocks of similar amino acid sequences as data, then applying statistical methods to the data to obtain the similarity scores. Statistical Methods Steps : Eliminating Sequences Eliminate the sequences that are more than r% identical. There are two ways to eliminate the sequences. It can be done either by removing sequences from the block or just by finding similar sequences and replace them by new sequences which could represent the cluster. Elimination is done to remove protein sequences that are more similar than the specified threshold. Calculating Frequency & Probability A database storing the sequence alignments of the most conserved regions of protein families. These alignments are used to derive the BLOSUM matrices. Only the sequences with a percentage of identity lower than the threshold are used. By using the block, counting the pairs of amino acids in each column of the multiple alignment. Log odd ratio It gives the ratio of the occurrence each amino acid combination in the observed data to the expected value of occurrence of the pair. It is rounded off and used in the substitution matrix. LogOddRatio=2 \\\\log_2{\\\\left( \\\\frac{P \\\\left(O \\\\right)}{P \\\\left(E \\\\right)} \\\\right)} In which P \\\\left(O \\\\right) is the possibility of observed and P \\\\left(E \\\\right) is the possibility of expected. BLOSUM Matrices The odds for relatedness are calculated from log odd ratio, which are then rounded off to get the substitution matrices BLOSUM matrices. Score of the BLOSUM matrices A scoring matrix or a table of values is required for evaluating the significance of a sequence alignment, such as describing the probability of a biologically meaningful amino-acid or nucleotide residue-pair occurring in an alignment. Typically, when two nucleotide sequences are being compared, all that is being scored is whether or not two bases are the same at one position. All matches and mismatches are respectively given the same score (typically +1 or +5 for matches, and -1 or -4 for mismatches). But it is different for proteins. Substitution matrices for amino acids are more complicated and implicitly take into account everything that might affect the frequency with which any amino acid is substituted for another. The objective is to provide a relatively heavy penalty for aligning two residues together if they have a low probability of being homologous (correctly aligned by evolutionary descent). Two major forces drive the amino-acid substitution rates away from uniformity: substitutions occur with the different frequencies, and lessen functionally tolerated than others. Thus, substitutions are selected against. Commonly used substitution matrices include the blocks substitution (BLOSUM) and point accepted mutation (PAM) matrices. Both are based on taking sets of high-confidence alignments of many homologous proteins and assessing the frequencies of all substitutions, but they are computed using different methods. Scores within a BLOSUM are log-odds scores that measure, in an alignment, the logarithm for the ratio of the likelihood of two amino acids appearing with a biological sense and the likelihood of the same amino acids appearing by chance. The matrices are based on the minimum percentage identity of the aligned protein sequence used in calculating them.page 673 Every possible identity or substitution is assigned a score based on its observed frequencies in the alignment of related proteins.NIH \\"Scoring Systems\\" A positive score is given to the more likely substitutions while a negative score is given to the less likely substitutions. To calculate a BLOSUM matrix, the following equation is used: :S_{ij}= \\\\frac{1}{\\\\lambda} \\\\log{ \\\\frac{p_{ij}}{q_i q_j} } Here, p_{ij} is the probability of two amino acids i and j replacing each other in a homologous sequence, and q_i and q_j are the background probabilities of finding the amino acids i and j in any protein sequence. The factor \\\\lambda is a scaling factor, set such that the matrix contains easily computable integer values. ==An example - BLOSUM62== BLOSUM80: more related proteins BLOSUM62: midrange BLOSUM45: distantly related proteins An article in Nature Biotechnology revealed that the BLOSUM62 used for so many years as a standard is not exactly accurate according to the algorithm described by Henikoff and Henikoff. Surprisingly, the miscalculated BLOSUM62 improves search performance. The BLOSUM62 matrix with the amino acids in the table grouped according to the chemistry of the side chain, as in (a). Each value in the matrix is calculated by dividing the frequency of occurrence of the amino acid pair in the BLOCKS database, clustered at the 62% level, divided by the probability that the same two amino acids might align by chance. The ratio is then converted to a logarithm and expressed as a log odds score, as for PAM. BLOSUM matrices are usually scaled in half-bit units. A score of zero indicates that the frequency with which a given two amino acids were found aligned in the database was as expected by chance, while a positive score indicates that the alignment was found more often than by chance, and negative score indicates that the alignment was found less often than by chance. ==Some uses in bioinformatics== Research applications BLOSUM scores was used to predict and understand the surface gene variants among hepatitis B virus carriers and T-cell epitopes. Surface gene variants among hepatitis B virus carriers DNA sequences of HBsAg were obtained from 180 patients, in which 51 were chronic HBV carrier and 129 newly diagnosed patients, and compared with consensus sequences built with 168 HBV sequences imported from GenBank. Literature review and BLOSUM scores were used to define potentially altered antigenicity. Reliable prediction of T-cell epitopes A novel input representation has been developed consisting of a combination of sparse encoding, Blosum encoding, and input derived from hidden Markov models. this method predicts T-cell epitopes for the genome of hepatitis C virus and discuss possible applications of the prediction method to guide the process of rational vaccine design. Use in BLAST BLOSUM matrices are also used as a scoring matrix when comparing DNA sequences or protein sequences to judge the quality of the alignment. This form of scoring system is utilized by a wide range of alignment software including BLAST. Comparing PAM and BLOSUM In addition to BLOSUM matrices, a previously developed scoring matrix can be used. This is known as a PAM. The two result in the same scoring outcome, but use differing methodologies. BLOSUM looks directly at mutations in motifs of related sequences while PAM's extrapolate evolutionary information based on closely related sequences. Since both PAM and BLOSUM are different methods for showing the same scoring information, the two can be compared but due to the very different method of obtaining this score, a PAM100 does not equal a BLOSUM100. {  style=\\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto; text- align:center; width: 30%;\\" - !

The company was later headquartered in Los Gatos, California, and had offices in North America, Europe and Asia. It designed and sold security processors. It was acquired by Exar in 2009. ==History== 1996-2008: Founding and early years Hifn was founded in 1996 as a spin-out of the semiconductor company Stac, Inc. It held its initial public offering in December 1998. The company's stock was traded on the NASDAQ under the symbol HIFN. In 1998, Hifn became the first company to offer a processor with integrated encryption and compression, following this in 1999 with the fastest security processor for VPNs. In 2000, Hifn announced an \\"Intelligent Packet Processor\\": a security co-processor capable of not only performing raw algorithm processing, but also modifying the complete packet, allowing their processors to transform an IP packet into an IPSec packet in a single pass in the security processor, with only the policy and IPsec stack being required on the host CPU. In 2001, the company announced a security processor featuring the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) algorithm. In 2004 they followed on from their packet processor with an IPsec protocol processor, capable of performing IPsec and Internet Key Exchange processing with no CPU intervention. They also adapted this processor for the storage area network market, for applications such as iSCSI. A secondary offering was priced on April 12, 2004. Hifn also offered security processors for secure VoIP and WiMax applications, and marketed them for \\"application-aware\\" flow classifiers and search engines. In earlier 2004, Hifn acquired part of IBM Network Processor assets in addition to PowerNP's intellectual property license. Hifn became the sole vendor of PowerNP (IBM code: Rainier) to some telecom/datacom equipment manufacturers. Acquisition by Exar On April 3, 2009, semiconductor manufacturer Exar Corporation closed the acquisition of Hifn. The transaction included stock and about $67 million in cash. ==Products== Hifn held the patents for the Lempel–Ziv–Stac and Microsoft Point-to-Point Compression compression algorithms. ==References== Category:Manufacturing companies established in 1996 Category:Companies based in Silicon Valley Category:Fabless semiconductor companies Category:Defunct semiconductor companies of the United States ","title":"Hifn"},{"id":"5558626","text":"George Groeneveld (born 1940 or 1941) is a Canadian politician and was a Member of the Legislative Assembly of Alberta representing the constituency of Highwood as a Progressive Conservative. ==Early life== Groeneveld was born in Blackie, Alberta.

The dramedy tells the story of a suicidal young man and his stay in a Dublin psychiatric hospital where he meets new friends who greatly impact his life. ==Synopsis== Within a space of 24 hours, Jonathan Breech (Murphy) attends his father's funeral, gets high, steals a car, picks up someone else's girlfriend, dumps her on the side of the road and then drives himself off a cliff. Having suffered no more than a broken finger, he is faced with either a spell in prison or a stay in a psychiatric hospital. He puts himself into the care of Dr Figure (Rea), making it clear he's there for a holiday and not an evaluation. But as Jonathan reluctantly agrees to attend Dr Figure's therapy sessions, and comes into contact with fellow patients Rachel (Vessey) and Toby (Jackson), he begins to rethink his attitude on life. ==Plot== Jonathan Breech (Cillian Murphy) is 19 when his father drinks himself to death. After a night with a gram of cocaine, another man's girlfriend and already stolen convertible, he goes to his older brother Mikey's (Paul Hickey) house at five in the morning to get his father's ashes. With the urn in the back seat he then goes on a suicidal drive. After waking up in a hospital he is given a choice: prison for the stolen car or a mental institution. He chooses the latter. His room there is small and very near barren. Wednesdays are visiting days, when his brother can come. The recreation room has a TV, cards and velcro-tipped throwing darts. Since he is an inpatient he is forced to only wear pajamas as per the health board rules. He has three group therapy sessions a week with Dr. Figure (Stephen Rea). There, he meets Rachel (Tricia Vessey), Toby (Jonathan Jackson), Nick (Tomás Ó Súilleabháin) and Leslie (Marcella Plunkett). He voices romantic interest in Rachel but leaves the first session early. Rachel follows him to slap him for treating her patronisingly. They begin play boxing, but stop when she accidentally hits his mouth hard and draws blood. Jonathan goes to the restroom to take care of his bloody lip, and Rachel follows him and shows an attraction to blood, smearing it on to her throat and chest. Jonathan is unsettled, but intrigued. He then befriends Toby, who seems to also have a crush on Rachel. One-on-one therapy sessions with Dr. Figure are sarcastic, but he does ask patients to take a pledge not to kill themselves before New Year's Eve. Jonathan's friendship with Toby starts to gel when they sneak out to a pub together at night. After returning to his room, Jonathan is surprised to discover Rachel there waiting for him. While he is lying on top of her, Rachel pulls out a razor hidden in a cigarette box and cuts her arm, which seems to intensify her sexual excitement. When the blood drips onto Jonathan's neck, he puts a stop to things. In the following days, Jonathan has therapy sessions with Dr. Figure, and continues to flirt with Rachel, showing a more sincere interest in her. One night out with Toby, after he hot-wired a car Jonathan learns that Toby caused the death of his brother in a car accident. On bowling night, Jonathan gets into conflict that nearly turns violent, and Dr. Figure helps him see that he was reckless with his well-being but that perhaps he is glad to have made it through alive. The romantic triangle comes into sharper focus as Toby reads a new poem he wrote to Rachel and flirts timidly. Later Jonathan and Rachel chat in her room and he learns of Rachel's mother's death, and a bond between them deepens. The friends sneak out of the hospital to host a big New Year's Eve party at Rachel's father's house. Toby watches Jonathan and Rachel's energy as they dance together, and realises that he doesn't have a chance with Rachel. Soon Jonathan and Rachel are seen going upstairs. In another part of the house Toby is opening up the garage. Jonathan tries to kiss Rachel but she won't kiss back. As the count down to the New Year begins Rachel starts to kiss back and Toby gets ready in the car to be done with his pledge. At the stroke of midnight Toby drives off a cliff, killing himself. The next day, Rachel's father pulls her out of the hospital, and Jonathan is miserable and worried about her. In a therapy session he asks Dr. Figure what will happen to Rachel. Dr. Figure responds that Jonathan needs to decide to value his own life. When Jonathan steals a bike to get out of the hospital, Dr. Figure tells the guard to allow him to leave. Jonathan goes to Rachel's dad's house, then to the cliffs. He finds her there, looking over the edge. Jonathan tells Rachel that he loves her that he thinks they could still be together in a year. They walk away together. ==Reception== On Rotten Tomatoes in 2/18 On the Edge had a 63% critics rating and 79% audience rating.https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1109473_on_the_edge? ==Cast== * Cillian Murphy as Jonathan Breech * Tricia Vessey as Rachel Row * Jonathan Jackson as Toby * Stephen Rea as Dr. Figure * Paul Hickey as Mikey * Tomás Ó Súilleabháin as Nick * Marcella Plunkett as Leslie Jonathan Jackson, who is American, put on a Belfast accent for the film. ==Selected songs from the soundtrack== * \\"1979\\" – Smashing Pumpkins * \\"Start!\\" – The Jam * \\"Singin' in the Rain\\" – Gene Kelly * \\"Is She Weird?\\" – Pixies * \\"Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer\\" – Burl Ives * \\"Alright\\" – Supergrass * \\"Catch the Sun\\" – Doves * \\"Seven Day Mile\\" – The Frames * \\"Please Forgive Me\\" – David Gray * \\"He's Not That Kind of Girl\\" – Therapy? * \\"God Kicks\\" – Therapy? ==ReferencesExternal links== * RTÉ review * * On the Edge review (German) Category:2001 films Category:Irish films Category:Irish drama films Category:2001 drama films Category:Films about psychiatry Category:Universal Pictures direct-to- video films Category:Films set in Dublin (city) Category:Films about suicide Category:Films about depression Category:Films directed by John Carney ","title":"On the Edge (2001 film)"},{"id":"5558700","text":"Taipei Gida () was a Taiwanese professional baseball team that existed from 1997 to 2002. It was one of the four Taiwan Major League (TML) teams and was based in Taipei, Taiwan. Its historical sponsors included local Sampo Corporation and Macoto Bank, so the team was called \\"Taipei Sampo Gida\\" (台北聲寶太陽) or \\"Taipei Macoto Gida\\" (台北誠泰太陽). The team's history could be traced back to 1991 when Sampo Corporation's then chairman Chen Sheng-tian (陳盛沺) started to sponsor Chinese Culture University's baseball team. After these student players graduated, Chen formed the amateur baseball team Sampo Giants to host them; he tried to enter the Chinese Professional Baseball League starting 1992. Strangely, Chen's applications were repeatedly rejected, so he decided to cooperate with TVBS's then-chairman Chiu Fu-sheng to form TML and turned Sampo Giants into Taipei Gida. However, Chen finally ceased to support this team by the end of 2000 after long-time losing. Macoto Bank took it up later. The team's historical performance was not bad, winning the championship twice during TML's 6-season short history. This team is also the only TML team that never annually ranked last in the league. After TML's merger with the Chinese Professional Baseball League in early 2003, the team was absorbed by First Financial Holdings Agan and later La New Bears. == Regular Season Records == { - !Year !Win !Loss !Tie !Rank !Win-Loss% - 1997534302.552 - 1998535323.500 - 1999483331.593 - 2000523021.634 - 2001312722.534 - 2002313923.443 - Total26822511.544 } *TML Championships: twice, 1998 and 2000 == Notable former players == *Sam Horn *Takehiro Ishii *Lenin Picota *Keith Dishart == External links == *Taipei Gida in Taiwan Baseball Wiki (in Traditional Chinese) * Category:Defunct baseball teams in Taiwan Category:Baseball teams established in 1997 Category:Baseball teams disestablished in 2002 Category:Sport in Taipei Category:Companies based in Taipei Category:1997 establishments in Taiwan Category:2002 disestablishments in Taiwan ","title":"Taipei Gida"},{"id":"5558720","text":"The Australian Native Plants Society (Australia) (ANPSA) is a federation of seven state-based member organisations for people interested in Australia's native flora, both in aspects of conservation and in cultivation.

By 1958 active regional Societies had been established in six States and the ACT with the Federal Association (ASGAP) being formed in 1962 Initially the focus was on growing and learning about Australian Flora more for home and amenities plantings – members included botanists and horticulturists as well as enthusiastic laypeople. As time has gone on, there has been an increasing focus on conservation, and advocacy for conservation, of Australian Flora. The Wildflower Society in Western Australia has been particularly diligent in liaising with government bodies in that state and the New South Wales body is a member of the Nature Conservation Council of NSW. The national association changed its name to the Australian Native Plants Society (Australia) in 2008. Rare and \\"hard to find\\" Australian plants can be purchased at their plant sales, which typically occur twice a year, spring and autumn, in many regions. ==Promotion of Australian flora== Over the years, many important figures in Australian Botany and Horticulture have been members, Alex George, John Wrigley, Rodger Elliot, Angus Stewart and Ivan Holliday to name a few.

It is different from the sport known in the US and Canada as paddle tennis. Padel is typically played in doubles on an enclosed court roughly 25% smaller than the size of a tennis court. Scoring is the same as normal tennis and the balls used are similar but with a little less pressure. The main differences are that the court has walls and the balls can be played off them in a similar way as in the game of squash and that solid, stringless bats are used. The height of the ball being served must be at or below the waist level. Padel is not to be confused with platform tennis, a winter and summer sport typically played at country clubs in the US and Canada, with courts heated from below to eliminate snow and water. The court, rules and styles of play are very different. ==History== The sport was invented in Acapulco, Mexico, by Enrique Corcuera in 1969. It is currently most popular in Spain, Mexico and Andorra as well as Hispanic American countries such as Argentina, although it is now beginning to spread rapidly across Europe and other continents. Padel Pro Tour (PPT) was the professional padel circuit which was created in 2005 as a result of the agreement between a group of organizers of matches of padel and Association of Professional Players of Pádel (AJPP) and the Spanish Feminine Association of Pádel (AFEP). Nowadays, the most important padel circuit is World Padel Tour (WPT), which started in Spain though it has already reached international expansion. In 2014 WPT has traveled to Portugal, Argentina and Dubai. The sport's popularity along the Costa del Sol in southern Spain and the Algarve in southern Portugal has exposed it to a large number of British visitors, leading to an increased popularity of the sport in the UK and a launch of the UK Padel Federation in 2011. United States of America The US Padel Association was founded in Chattanooga, Tennessee in 1993, and opened two courts in the Chattanooga area. The American Paddle Association was formed in 1995 and built its first courts at a private club in Houston, Texas for exhibition games. The first public courts opened in Miami, Florida in 2009, and several clubs have opened nearby, as well as in Los Angeles, since then. Singapore In 2014, the Swiss Club in Singapore opened the first padel court in Singapore.  Egypt  In 2014, Mohamed Atef, Mohamed Saada, and Amir El Samahy introduced the sport to the country with the collaboration of technicians from Spain. The first court was built in Katameya Heights in New Cairo. More courts have been built since and the sport has gained in popularity since its introduction.  Denmark  The first Padel Court in Denmark was founded in Fredericia 2007. It has not been approved by the Danish Padel Association as the first, however generally to the public it is referred to as \\"The first\\". Several clubs still use this old- school court for both leisure and Tournaments. The local club \\"Padøl-banden\\" are the proud owners of the court record of - longest match ever played. In 2012 they played 11 hours and 52 minutes over one match. ==The court== Padel court dimensions Padel rules states that the playing field should be a rectangle wide (back wall) and long (side wall) (with a 0.5% tolerance), enclosed by walls. At the middle of the playing field there will be a net dividing the court in two, the net has a maximum height of 88 cm in the center raising to at sides (with a tolerance). The superstructure is made from connecting 3m high x 2m wide panels, with an additional 1m mesh height over the glass back walls (10m walls). This additional 1m height is continued for 2m from each corner over the side walls also. This means that the back walls and service corners are actually 4m in height, with the remaining side walls are 3m in height. Glass panels make up the back walls and service side walls (closest 2 side panels to back walls), whilst metal mesh panels occupy the sides. The service lines are placed before the back wall and there will be also another line in middle that divides the central rectangle in half. All lines have a width and should be clearly visible. The minimum height between the playing field and an obstacle (for e.g. the ceiling) is . ==Facts== Padel area at ISPO 2014 * Players: Singles use instead of . * Serves: Both first and second serves must be underhand. * Score: Scoring method is the same as in tennis. * Ball: Very similar to tennis balls.

The character is depicted as a member of the Eternals. ==Publication history== Zuras first appeared in The Eternals #5 (November 1976), and was created by Jack Kirby. Marvel Comics continuity was later retconned so that the character presented as the mythological god Jupiter, introduced in Red Raven Comics #1 (August 1940), was, in fact, Zuras. ==Fictional character biography== Zuras was born in Titanos, first city of the Eternals, and is the son of the Eternals Kronos and Daina, and brother of A'Lars (Mentor). With his wife Cybele, he has a daughter Thena. Zuras was a warrior, and vied with his brother A'lars (whom he exiled into space) for leadership of the Eternals of Titanos following Kronos' death. Zuras was the first Eternal to form a Uni-Mind by creating the first ritual of the Uni-Mind, and was therefore chosen to become leader of the Eternals of Earth.What If Vol. 1 #25 He was mistaken for the Greek god Zeus many times in the past, and ultimately forged a pact with Zeus to keep their people at peace. When Kro spread chaos in the 1940s, Zuras sent Makkari to oppose him. He also forced the Forgotten One into exile, stripped him of his name, and forbade the Eternals from communicating with him. Zuras appears to have been well- traveled, since his quarters in Olympia were decorated with a jukebox, two six-shooters and battle-axes. Zuras authorized Thena to resume her battles against the Deviants, and ordered her and Makkari to battle against Zakka in New York.Eternals Vol. 1 #5 He also aided Mr. Bradford, a government agent, in studying the Celestials. Zuras attempted to mind-probe the Celestial craft, and learned of the coming of the Fourth Celestial Host.Eternals Vol. 1 #10 He initiated the first Uni-Mind fusion of Eternals in modern times to attempt to communicate with Arishem.Eternals Vol. 1 #11-12 He ended the Uni-Mind fusion,Eternals Vol. 1 #14 and traveled to New York City and addressed the public on the subject of the Celestial host on a television broadcast.Eternals Vol. 1 #15 He explored the tomb of Dromedan the Brain-Snatcher,Eternals Vol. 1 #16 and battled Dromedan.Eternals Vol. 1 #17 He then assisted the U.S. State Department in the investigation of the Celestial threat.Eternals Vol. 1 #18 Zuras later encountered Thor.Thor #287 Zuras initiated a second Uni-Mind fusion to prove the Celestial mothership, and battled Zeus.Thor #291 Zuras then allied himself with Odin and initiated the third Uni-Mind to combat the Fourth Host of Celestials in Peru. While fused with the Eternals in the Uni- Mind formation, Zuras attacked the Fourth Celestial host. The Uni-Mind was blown apart by a cosmic blast from the Celestials Gammenon and Jemiah, causing it to disintegrate into its component Eternals, and the backlash caused Zuras's brain death.Thor #300, death revealed in Thor #301 Even then, Zuras' spirit continued to exist within his body, until his body was finally destroyed by freeing Thena from a Brain-Mine, at which point Zuras's spirit left his body.Iron Man Annual #6 Zuras's spirit still seems to exist, as it has appeared at times within Olympia, such as when Ikaris challenged Thena for the title of Prime Eternal. Reborn Sprite stated that he used the machineries of Olympia to partially \\"reactivate\\" Zuras—and then deceived Zuras into visiting the tomb of the Dreaming Celestial, forming a Uni-Mind there. This provided Sprite with the power he needed to rewrite some aspects of reality, stripping the other Eternals of their powers and memories. Sprite also stated that he considered Zuras to be the most powerful of the Eternals. In the \\"rewritten\\" world, Zuras was made into an alcoholic homeless man, with mental problems. He was, however, restored by Ajak. Ultimately, Zuras found Sprite after the events were resolved, and killed him by snapping Sprite's neck.The Eternals, written by Neil Gaiman (2006) Later when the Celestials' Final Host arrived on Earth, Zuras along with all the Eternals killed themselves after realizing the true purpose for which they were created.Avengers (vol. 8) #4 ==Powers and abilities== Zuras has achieved above average development of the normal attributes of the race of Eternals through great discipline. He possesses superhuman strength, speed, stamina, and durability, and can fly at supersonic speeds. Zuras possesses the ability to manipulate cosmic energy to augment his life force granting him great longevity and regenerative abilities, the projection of concussive force, heat and electrical energy up to a maximum range of 300 feet. He could also use cosmic energy to create force shields around himself, to levitate himself and/or others, and to psionically manipulate molecules so as to transform an object's shape. During his lifetime, Zuras was the only Eternal known capable of initiating the creation of the Uni-Mind (the collective life-form resulting from the physical and mental merging of a significant number of Eternals) by himself. Zuras is also capable of telepathy, illusion-casting, and limited teleportation. Zuras possesses extensive knowledge of ancient and arcane wisdom. ==ReferencesExternal links== *Zuras at the Marvel Universe *Zuras at the Marvel Directory *Zuras at the Marvel Database *Zuras at ImmortalThor.net Category:Characters created by Jack Kirby Category:Comics characters introduced in 1976 Category:Eternals Category:Fictional genetically engineered characters Category:Fictional kings Category:Marvel Comics characters with superhuman strength ","title":"Zuras"},{"id":"5558828","text":"Kenana ibn al-Rabi' () also known as Kenana ibn al-Rabi'a and Kenana ibn al- Rabi ibn Abu al-Huqayq, was a Jewish Arab tribal leader of seventh-century Arabia and an opponent of Muhammad. He was a son of the poet al-Rabi ibn Abu al-Huqayq. Ibn al-Rabi' was killed during early Muslim clashes with the Banu Nadir. ==Biography== He had two brothers — al-Rabi and Sallam. Kenana is said to have urged Muhammad to give up the custom during prayer of turning his face toward Mecca (\\"Qiblah\\") in favor of Jerusalem, as had been the custom in Islam at first. After the expulsion of the Banu al-Nadir, of which tribe he was a member, he and his family retired to Khaybar, where they possessed a castle called Qamus.s.v. «Khaybar», The Encyclopedia of Islam (L. Veccia Vaglieri). Ibn Ishaq writes about Kenana ibn al-Rabi:Ibn Hisham. Al-Sira al-Nabawiyya (The Life of The Prophet). English translation in Guillame (1955), pp. 145-146 > Kenana al-Rabi, who had the custody of the treasure of Banu Nadir, was > brought to the apostle who asked him about it. He denied that he knew where > it was. A Jew came (Tabari says \\"was brought\\"), to the apostle and said that > he had seen Kenana going round a certain ruin every morning early. When the > apostle said to Kenana, \\"Do you know that if we find you have it I shall > kill you?\\" He said \\"Yes\\". The apostle gave orders that the ruin was to be > excavated and some of the treasure was found. When he asked him about the > rest he refused to produce it, so the apostle gave orders to al-Zubayr Al- > Awwam, \\"Torture him until you extract what he has.\\" So he kindled a fire > with flint and steel on his chest until he was nearly dead. Then the apostle > delivered him to Muhammad b. Maslama and he struck off his head, in revenge > for his brother Mahmud In addition to Ibn Ishaq's narration Al-Tabari writes: > The Prophet gave orders concerning Kenana to Zubayr, saying, ‘Torture him > until you root out and extract what he has. So Zubayr kindled a fire on > Kenana’s chest, twirling it with his firestick until Kenana was near death. > Then the Messenger gave him to Maslamah, who beheaded him. -- Al-Tabari, > Vol. 8, p. 122 Al-Mubarakpuri maintains that al-Rabi was bound by agreements between Muhammad and Khaybar to not conceal anything from the Muslims. He was executed, al- Mubarakpuri concludes, for breaching the agreement.Mubarakpuri (1996), pg. 372 Montgomery Watt supports the view that he was executed for concealing the treasure.Watt (1956), pg. 218 Shibli Nomani, however, argues that Kenana was put to death because he had killed Mahmud, the brother of Muhammad bin Maslama. Nomani also casts doubt on the accuracy of the story due to its sources (see section below).Nomani, vol. II, pg. 173 Shortly after the death of Kenana, Muhammad took his widowed wife Safiyya bint Huyayy as his captive, prior to marrying her and granting her emancipation. Criticism of Ibn Ishaq's Account In hadith studies, ibn Isḥaq's hadith (considered separately from his prophetic biography) is generally thought to be \\"good\\" (ḥasan) (assuming an accurate and trustworthy isnad, or chain of transmission) and himself having a reputation of being \\"sincere\\" or \\"trustworthy\\" (ṣadūq). However, a general analysis of his isnads has given him the negative distinction of being a mudallis, meaning one who did not name his teacher, claiming instead to narrate directly from his teacher's teacher. Concerning his sīra, the most notable and widely discussed criticism was that of his contemporary, Malik ibn Anas, who leveled many accusations against Ibn Ishaq.See also al-Dhahabī's negative assessment of Ibn Ishaq's sīra, in Mīzān al-iʿtidāl fī naqd al-rijāl Malik rejected the stories of Muhammad and the Jews of Medina on ground that they were taken solely based on accounts by sons of Jewish converts. These same stories have also been denounced as \\"odd tales\\" later by Ibn Hajar. Malik and others also thought that Ibn Ishaq relied too heavily on the Isra'iliyat. ==See also== *Ibn Ishaq *Banu Nadir *List of battles of Muhammad ==NotesSources== *Muhammad ibn Ismail al-Bukhari.

Given the limited time to prepare the studio after OLN won the broadcasting rights of the NHL in the summer of 2005, the first set was extremely spartan. This served as the temporary home to Hockey Central until a permanent set could be built midway through the first season. The show is hosted by Bill Patrick and a rotating panel of analysts as they break down highlights of other games, show special features on NHL players, and debate key issues in the NHL. The format is similar to TNT's Inside the NBA. Sometimes, VERSUS airs a pre-game edition of the show, usually prior to a double-header. The show originally did not air after double-headers, instead it usually took place between games, but starting with the 2007–08 season, aired both in between and after doubleheaders, unless the early game goes to overtime. It is also known as the \\"Hockey Central Post Game Report\\" or just \\"Hockey Central\\". The show was sponsored by eSurance during the 2006–07 season, and is now sponsored by Bud Light.

He also was a member of the Ottawa Rough Riders in the Canadian Football League and the Chicago Winds in the World Football League. He played college football at Henderson County Junior College. ==Early years== Margene Adkins attended Kirkpatrick High School, where he practiced basketball until his junior year, when he began playing football. He played college football at Henderson County Junior College in Athens, Texas, where he participated in the Junior Rose Bowl twice. He had a brief stay at Wichita University, before dropping out of school. ==Professional career== Ottawa Rough Riders (CFL) While still a teenager, he joined the Ottawa Rough Riders of the Canadian Football League as a wide receiver. In 1969, Adkins was voted to the CFL All-Star team after setting a regular season record for the highest average gain per pass reception at 25.0 yards, a record that stood for twenty-eight years (broken by Milt Stegall). He was part of both Ottawa's Grey Cup winning teams in 1968 and 1969, catching an important TD pass in the 1968 game when the Rough Riders defeated the Calgary Stampeders 24-21. Because he signed his original contract as a 19-year-old minor, he played out his option. He played three years, registering 47, 32 and 56 receptions, while averaging 10 touchdowns per season. Dallas Cowboys Adkins was selected by the Dallas Cowboys in the second round (49th overall) of the 1970 NFL Draft. Having star wide receivers such as Lance Alworth and Bob Hayes, the team used Adkins primarily as a punt and kick returner during his two seasons, when injuries didn't limit him. In 1970, he was placed on the injured reserve list, after playing in 5 games. In 1971, he only played in three games because of injuries and was placed on the team's taxi squad. Although he wasn't on the active roster when the Cowboys won Super Bowl VI, he still received a ring and a full share of the playoff bonuses. In 1972, he asked the Cowboys to trade him, so he was sent to the New Orleans Saints in exchange for second round draft choice (#39-John Babinecz). New Orleans Saints In 1972, he was acquired after he impressed the New Orleans Saints during a 1971 preseason game, where he had 3 receptions for 138 yards and 2 touchdowns. He led the Saints in kickoff returns with 1,020 yards and a 23.7 average, even though he played through an ankle injury. On June 5, 1973, he was traded to the New York Jets along with punter Julian Fagan and an eight-round draft choice (#192-Larry Lightfoot), in exchange for quarterback Bob Davis, punter Steve O'Neal and a fourth round draft choice (#83-Clint Haslerig). New York Jets Injuries also hampered his 1973 season with the New York Jets. He started 5 games, posting 6 receptions for 109 yards. After he injured his knee during the 1974 offseason, Adkins was placed on injured reserve and eventually released before the start of the 1975 season. Chicago Winds (WFL) In 1975, he joined the Chicago Winds of the World Football League, catching 12 passes for 130 and one touchdown. The Winds folded before the season ended, finishing 1-4. Adkins was selected by the San Antonio Wings in the Chicago Winds dispersal draft, but he didn't play for the team. ==Personal life== Adkins worked as a firefighter for Lockheed Martin in his hometown of Fort Worth, Texas. ==ReferencesExternal links== *Margene Strikes it rich as a Cowboy in 'limbo' Category:1947 births Category:Living people Category:Sportspeople from Fort Worth, Texas Category:Players of American football from Texas Category:Trinity Valley Cardinals football players Category:Wichita State Shockers football players Category:American football return specialists Category:American players of Canadian football Category:Canadian football wide receivers Category:Chicago Winds players Category:Dallas Cowboys players Category:Grey Cup champions Category:New Orleans Saints players Category:New York Jets players Category:Ottawa Rough Riders players Category:Super Bowl champions ","title":"Margene Adkins"},{"id":"5558869","text":"Lucious H.

All-New Invaders\\" Issue #3 ==Fictional character biography== Origins Ikaris was born over 20,000 years ago in Polaria, in the area now known as Siberia. He is the son of the Eternals Virako and Tulayn. His real birth name is unknown. When the Second Host of the Celestials sank the Deviant Lemuria in what is known as the \\"Great Cataclysm\\", Ikaris guides a ship of humans to safety. The humans mistake Ikaris for a bird, and (per Marvel Universe history) he is memorialized as the dove that guided Noah to the Mountains of Ararat (Eternals vol. 1, #2). Early centuries Ikaris chose his name due to a tragic accident hundreds of years ago. While fighting the Deviants in ancient Greece, the man eventually known as Ikaris meets and weds a human woman. Together they bear a son named Icarus, who loves to soar with his father high above the seas and mountains of Greece. In time, the Eternal builds his son a set of mechanical wings so the boy can fly on his own. When his father disappears while fighting the Deviants, the young Icarus seeks him out using the mechanical wings. Too inexperienced to fly on his own, young Icarus soars too high, loses consciousness in the upper atmosphere, and falls to his death. Finding his son dead, the father Eternal takes the name of his son, Ikaris, in his memory. Around 1000 AD, Virako, Ikaris' father, dies in battle against the Deviant Dromedan. Ikaris is then adopted by his uncle Valkin, who reveals to him his secret Arctic home, the Pyramid of the Winds. At some point during the early centuries, Ikaris and the Eternals would come into conflict with the immortal mutant, Apocalypse. This conflict would end with Ikaris and the Eternals defeating him, and Ikaris believing Apocalypse to be dead. In 1823, as part of the Eternals' preparation for the coming of the Fourth Host of the Celestials, Zuras orders Ikaris to perfect his cosmic senses in anticipation of their coming. When they draw near, Ikaris is ordered to go to the City of the Space Gods and revive the sleeping Eternal Ajak to greet them. Modern Era When the Celestials arrive on Earth around a century and a half later, Ikaris succeeds in this mission with the aid of human archaeologist Dr. Daniel Damian and his daughter, Margo. Ikaris witnesses the arrival of the Fourth Celestial Host on Earth.Eternals Vol. 1 #1-4 He then publicly reveals himself as all Eternals do.Eternals Vol. 1 #6 He later battles a \\"cosmic Hulk\\" robot,Eternals Vol. 1 #14-16 and fights Dromedan.Eternals Vol. 1 #17 During the Fourth Host, Valkin's son Druig captures and tortures Ikaris to force him to reveal the location of the Pyramid of the Winds. Ikaris catches up with Druig and kills him, but not before Druig is able to fire a weapon at a Celestial; the Celestial, however, is unharmed.Eternals Vol. 1 #19 Later, he encountered Thor for the first time.Thor #284-289 He next participated in a battle between the Eternals and the Olympian gods defeating Ares.Thor #291-292 Not long after that, he learned of the demise of Zuras, the Prime Eternal (leader of Earth's Eternals).Thor #301 Later, it was revealed how Ikaris first encountered the Inhumans.in a canonical story in What If Vol. 1 #29 Ikaris was later captured with the other Eternals by a Deviant army. He joined with the other Eternals and Iron Man (Jim Rhodes) in defeating the Deviants.Iron Man Annual #6 After that, Ikaris battled Maelstrom alongside the other Eternals and the Avengers. After the battle, he was selected by the Uni-Mind to remain on Earth.Avengers #246-248 During his long lifetime, Ikaris also attempts to be a fair and just leader of the Eternals, but has abandoned Eternal traditions to take an active and public role in protecting the human race. He has even adopted a unique human identity by becoming a professional wrestler with the Unlimited Class Wrestling Federation as \\"Iceberg\\" Ike Harris.Eternals Vol. 2 #1 Ikaris and fellow Eternal Thena have had a strong dislike for each other for a long time, and find themselves coming to conflict when she is appointed as Prime Eternal. Questioning her worth as Prime Eternal, Ikaris faces her in the Hall of Eternal Judgment and defeats her, becoming the new Prime Eternal. Ikaris then battled Ghaur alongside the Eternals, Thor, and the West Coast Avengers. He also buried Margo Damian when she was killed by a Deviant experiment.Eternals Vol. 2 #1-12 Later, with the other Eternals, Ikaris captured the Silver Surfer on behalf of the High Evolutionary.Silver Surfer Annual #1 Some time after that, he was captured by the Deviant leader Brother Visara, and then freed by Kro. Ikaris exposed Dr. Damian as the Eternals' enemy, and battled a transformed Ajak as a result.Eternals: The Herod Factor When the eternal Sersi became sick with the Mahd Wy'ry disease, a uncurable degenerating Eternal disease, Ikaris and others eternals tried to bring her to Olympia and perform a rite of Cleansing. However Sersi rejected the idea,in the basis that the ritual was designed to kill the infected Eternal, and solicited his family to perform the Gann Josin bond between her and her lover the Black Knight. Ikaris was furious by the idea, and performed the bond without consent of the Knight.Avengers #361. (1993) Marvel Comics. In The New Eternals series, Ikaris still retains the title of Prime Eternal. Ikaris and the Eternals' ancient nemesis Apocalypse returned to detonate a nuclear warhead on Deviant Lemuria. He causes Ikaris's father Virako to return to life. Ikaris confronts, and fights Apocalypse. Although Ikaris is defeated by Apocalypse, Ikaris still manages to destroy his ship and thwart Apocalypse's plan. Virako is appalled to find the Eternals accepting Deviants such as Ransak the Reject and Karkas. Under the alias of \\"Sovereign\\", he briefly introduces the Eternals to the world as a team of super-heroes called the \\"New Breed\\".The New Eternals: Apocalypse Now #1. (2000) Marvel Comics. Eternals mini-series (2006) Ikaris is featured in the Marvel mini-series Eternals, written by Neil Gaiman and penciled by artist John Romita, Jr.. The Eternals are the victims of memory and reality manipulation by former Eternal Sprite, and thus have forgotten their true identities. Although Ikaris (calling himself Ike Harris) is captured and atomized by the Deviants Gelt and Morjak, his body reappears at the bottom of the (fictional) Antarctic city of Olympia. His body and powers fully restored by the sentient city, Ikaris regains his memories and sets out to awaken his fellow Eternals to their true identities. After a prolonged battle, he at last unites the few Eternals present. He then plans to team up with Makkari and reawaken the ninety other Eternals. Eternals – Volume 4 At the end of the last volume, Makkari has been chosen as the \\"chosen one\\" that the awakened Dreaming Celestial communicates with. This is very frustrating to Ajak because he has spent his entire existence communing with the Celestials, their language and what their showing up means. In conversations between Makkari and the Dreaming Celestial, we find out that the Celestials pick or create a planet and seed it with life forms. They then create 100 Eternals and 100 Deviants. The Celestials then keep a watchful eye on the planet and weigh which of the two races influences the life forms more. This is done in servitude of the Fulcrum. If the Deviants influence has more prominence, the Celestials send the Horde to eradicate the race and they start over. If it is the Eternals, the Celestials allow the goodness to flow back into the Fulcrum, which the Celestials seems to serve. These conversations between Makkari and the Dreaming Celestial take place on a different plane of existence and cause Makkari's body to shut down, seemingly almost dying, which Sersi is concerned with because she thinks he is addicted to this state. We also see here the origin of the Dreaming Celestial and how he came to be put to sleep by the other Celestials. Next the story picks up with Thena and Ikaris, trying to find all of the other amnesiac Eternals and reminding them of who they are. They find that a similar effort is being conducted by Druig, who is now the ruler of Vorozheika. Druig is using a secret source to find the Eternals and is winning in the contest of finding and converting more Eternals to his cause. Ikaris and Thena approach Phastos, who thinks he is an engineer in Sweden named Phillip Voss. Thena tries to trigger his memory with questions about his past under the guise that she and Ikaris are attorneys executing the will of a deceased relative of Mr. Voss'. This ploy proves to be a failure and Ikaris just wants to force the memories on the Eternals who have lost their memories, but this also causes problems as they react violently to having their world's turned upside down like this. We then see that Thena prior to her trip with Ikaris to visit Phastos, she leaves her son Joey Eliot in the care of her father: Zuras who seems a little absent-minded. Zuras begins to explore and show the different parts of the Eternals' habitat with Joey. It is here we learn that the Horde that the Dreaming Celestial has spoken of, that is coming to Earth has an agent already on Earth who is bonded to a human via a symbiotic relationship. This turns out to be Thena's son Joey. Joey is then seen going into a trance-like state when viewing new and unexplored areas of the habitat and information and transmitting that information back to the Horde. Sersi investigates and finds out about this through tracing a signal that is being sent from the habitat to the Horde and she informs Zuras of this fact. Zuras scoffs at this notion and Joey's life is terminated by the symbiote who determines that he has been detected. Makkari gets wind of Joey and his death from the Dreaming Celestial. He immediately goes to the habitat of the Eternals—Olympia. Then Ajak comes up on the scene of a \\"Burning Man\\"-like party being held at the foot of the Dreaming Celestial. He attacks and disperses the worshippers there and is approached by Iron Man's strike team called the Order. Ajak uses a \\"jedi mind trick\\" to send the Order away, and Ikaris shows up to have him go undercover inside Druig's stronghold. Ajak agrees and he soon is put to task to find Gilgamesh. Ajak finds him and convinces him that Thena, and Ikaris are possessed by the Deviants and their influence. Eventually Gilgamesh attacks Makkari and beats him violently, leaving to finish his attack against other Eternals. Ajak shows up in the aftermath of Gilgamesh's attack and atomizes Makkari, knowing that he will be given a new body and regenerated in one of the chambers in Olympus like their race has used for thousands of years. Makkari's death makes it necessary for the Dreaming Celestial, who does not have anyone to communicate with, use a failsafe that puts all humanoids asleep on the planet, except Eternals and Deviants. Gilgamesh resumes his attack when he reaches Olympus and Thena barely defeats him, but only after he destroys the reassembling chamber that Makkari needs to reconstitute. Sersi then attacks the Dreaming Celestial and is told that she was given heightened powers to care for Makkari while he assisted the Dreaming Celestial in cataloging all super-powered beings on the planet. She then uses her powers to reconstitute Makkari, which stops the need for the failsafe of the Dreaming Celestial. And surprisingly when all of the humans awaken from their sleep, so to does Joey Eliot, ending Thena's sadness at the loss of her son. The Watcher mentions to the Dreaming Celestial that the child was dead and the Dreaming Celestial revived him. The Dreaming Celestial replies that the child was asleep like the rest of the humans and simply woke up when the rest did. The Watcher objects, and then realizes that the Dreaming Celestial has done this as an act of kindness, explained away as the child being simply asleep like the rest of the humans. Death Later when the Final Host arrived on Earth, Ikaris along with all the Eternals killed themselves after realizing the true purpose for which they were created. He was the last Eternal still alive when Iron Man and Doctor Strange traveled to the Mountains of Greece, to try to get some answers from The Eternals. Before his death, he told the heroes the reason for the mass suicide.Avengers (vol. 8) #4 ==Powers and abilities== Ikaris' life force is augmented by cosmic energy and he has total mental control over his physical form and bodily processes even when he is asleep or unconscious. As a result, he is virtually immortal, immune to disease and aging, and invulnerable to conventional forms of injury. Should Ikaris be injured somehow, he could regenerate any injured or missing tissue. Cosmic energy bolsters Ikaris's metabolism so that he does not tire from any physical exertion. He can resist temperature extremes through mental concentration. Ikaris can levitate himself by mentally manipulating gravitons around himself. He can also levitate other persons and objects, even while simultaneously levitating himself. Ikaris is able to fly via self-levitation at approximately 850 miles per hour, a rate of speed most other Eternals cannot match. Ikaris has low level psychic abilities, enabling him to scan the superficial thoughts of any mind less adept than his own. He can mentally create illusions so as to disguise himself. Ikaris can also psionically manipulate atoms and molecules so as to transform an object's shape. However, Ikaris is only a second-level adept on a five level scale (the fifth level being the highest) in this discipline. He can rearrange molecules in the air so as to create a virtually impenetrable shield about himself. Ikaris can project cosmic energy in the form of beams from his eyes or beams and flashes from his hands. This cosmic energy, stored in specialized enclaves of cells in his body, can be used as force, heat, light, and possibly other forms of electromagnetic energy. Ikaris can project a maximum concussive force of at least 260 pounds per square inch. He can project heat of a maximum temperature of at least 3,000 Fahrenheit, hot enough to melt iron. It takes about one minute for him to attain this maximum temperature. Because Ikaris's heat beams can vaporize solid objects, they are often called his disintegrator beams, The maximum range for his energy beams is about 200 feet. Ikaris is a fourth level adept on a five-level scale (the fifth level being the highest) in this discipline. The expenditure of cosmic energy in this way continually for several hours will temporarily deplete Ikaris's physical strength, but not his resistance to injury, although it will temporarily increase his sensitivity to pain. He will rapidly return to normal after such lengthy energy expenditure is over. Ikaris can teleport himself psionically, but prefers not to do so, since, like other Eternals, he finds the self-teleportation process physically unpleasant. He can also teleport other people along with himself. ==Other versions== Marvel 2099 There is an alternate future version of Ikaris in the Marvel 2099 universe. He appears in 2099: Manifest Destiny. The Eternal Chuck Austen wrote The Eternal, a 2003-2004 Marvel MAX series which showed the arrival of Ikaris' parents on Earth, in this version Ikaeden and Jeska, and his plan for the story involved \\"going back in time to see Ikaris birth and development on Earth, meet his parents, and then [we] move forward into contemporary time\\". ==In other media== Television * Ikaris appears in Marvel Knights: Eternals, voiced by Trevor Devall.

The term implies being given over to total hedonism and greed. In the Tathagatagarbha sutras, some of which pay particular attention to the icchantikas, the term is frequently used of those persons who do not believe in the Buddha, his eternal Selfhood and his Dharma (Truth) or in karma; who seriously transgress against the Buddhist moral codes and vinaya; and who speak disparagingly and dismissively of the reality of the immortal Buddha-nature (Buddha-dhatu) or Tathagatagarbha present within all beings. The two shortest versions of the Mahayana Mahaparinirvana Sutra - one translated by Fa-xian, and the other a middle-length Tibetan version of the sutra - indicate that the icchantika has so totally severed all his/her roots of goodness that he/she can never attain liberation and nirvana or enightenment (Buddhahood). The full-length Dharmakshema version of the Mahayana Mahaparinirvana Sutra, in contrast, insists that even the icchantika can eventually find release into nirvana,Liu , Ming-Wood (1984). The Problem of the Icchantika in the Mahāyāna Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra, Journal of the International Association of Buddhist Studies 7 (1), 71-72 since no phenomenon is fixed (including this type of allegedly deluded person) and that change for the better and best is always a possibility. Other scriptures (such as the Lankavatara Sutra) indicate that the icchantikas will be saved through the liberational power of the Buddha - who, it is claimed, will never abandon any being.

Ajak received an entry in the original Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe #1, and in the Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Master Edition #10. ==Fictional character biography== Ajak is a member of the sub-race of Eternals known as the Polar Eternals, born in the area of Polaria, Siberia to parents Raka and Amaa, with a brother named Arex, both as adults being archeologists with advanced knowledge of archeology. Ajak fought Warlord Kro's Deviant forces in Babylon 2500 years ago, also maintaining a strong presence in Central America, where they were both worshipped as gods; Ajak by Aztecs as the god Quetzalcoatl and by the Incas as Tecumotzin, Lord of Flight. Ajak once met the Norse god Thor, and fought alongside him against Dromedan. During the Third Host of the Celestials, Ajak acted as a liaison between the Celestials and Earth and was present in Peru when they arrived.as revealed in Thor Annual #7 With Zuras, Ajak arranged the flight plan the Celestials used to leave Earth, before both placed themselves into storage as atoms within the City of the Space Gods, to await their eventual return. Under Zuras' order, Ikaris awoke Ajak when the Fourth Host of the Celestials arrived.Eternals Vol. 1 #2 Ajak befriended human archaeologist Dr. Daniel Damian, and let him live in the City of the Space Gods. Ajak was sealed with Doctor Damian behind the force barrier surrounding the site of the Fourth Host's arrival.Eternals Vol. 1 #3 Ajak was attacked by agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., who were converted to stored atoms by the Celestials after their failed escape attempt,Eternals Vol. 1 #7 and was known for battling an Incan wrestler.Eternals Vol. 1 #12 Ajak then had another encounter with Thor at the Fourth Host site in Peru.Thor #284 This time Ajak opposed him, but Thor won their battle. Ultimately, Ajak battled Zeus on the behalf of his fellow Eternals, who merely saw the Eternals as the Celestials' pawns. He was later among the Eternals captured by Brother Tode, who were later set free by Iron Man (James Rhodes).Iron ManAnnual #6 Ajak joined the space-faring Eternals Uni-Mind,Avengers #248 later returning to Earth. A maddened Dr. Damian transformed Ajak into a monster through the use of Celestial technology, sending them to kill Thena and Kro's twin children, Donald & Deborah Ritter. The monstrous Ajak killed many sets of twins along the way. After the Eternals restored Ajak to their true form, suddenly grief- stricken with the deeds that committed as a monster, Ajak committed suicide, additionally disintegrating Dr. Damian himself.Eternals: The Herod Factor #1. Marvel Comics. Sprite states that sometime later he used the machineries of Olympia to partially \\"reactivate\\" Ajak and Zuras — and then deceived them into visiting the tomb of the Dreaming Celestial, forming a Uni-Mind there. This provided Sprite with the power needed to rewrite some aspects of reality, stripping the other Eternals of their powers and memories and removing all records of them from the world. Sprite also stated that Ajak is the only Eternal able to directly speak with the Celestials. Ajak appeared, seemingly in a normal state, and revived Zuras to their own normal state.Eternals #1-5 (2006). Marvel Comics. \\"Secret Invasion\\" In the 2008 \\"Secret Invasion\\" storyline, Ajak leaves to join Hercules' \\"God Squad\\" to battle the Skrull gods, not only to defend Earth, but, to gain a greater understanding of the Skrulls, in light of their being Deviants whose native people were also transformed by the Celestials, and to acquire a means to communicate with the Dreaming Celestial, whom only Makkari can communicate with.Incredible Hercules #117 (July 2008). Marvel Comics. Thinking Hercules to be a bad leader, Ajak takes command of the God Squad from him just before they battle the Skrull Gods, causing Snowbird's death due to a lack of planning. Ajak is subsequently killed in the confrontation with the Skrull God Kly'bn.Incredible Hercules #120 (August 2008). Marvel Comics. Post-\\"Secret Invasion\\" Later, a revived Ajak and the other Eternals, continues the mission of awakening Eternals who no longer remember who they are and are living human lives, thanks to Sprite. During this time Ajak breeds resentment towards Makkari for being the Dreaming Celestial's chosen communicator, warning the other Eternals that the Dreaming Celestial is broken. While Ikaris and Druig's opposing forces race to awaken and convert as many \\"sleeping\\" Eternals as they can to their respective sides, Ajak locates the Eternal known as Gilgamesh, \\"The Forgotten One\\", in Peru, manipulating them into believing Ikaris' Eternals are actually Deviants. Ajak does not do this out of loyalty to Druig, but out of resentment towards Makkari. Gilgamesh ends up brutally killing Makkari, which Druig and Legba witness. Ajak then goes to Makkari's side and signals Sersi, telling her that it was Druig and his forces that killed Makkari. Ajak then continues to monitor the Dreaming Celestial while Ikaris and Druig's forces go to battle. Sometime during these events, Ajak helps the Eternals battle the Young Gods, who have returned from the Celestial's ship. Ajak mainly watches the battle from Olympia, reveling in the Young Gods' defeat of Makkari, but when Makkari is about to be killed, Ajak chooses to intervene, believing even an Eternal such as Makkari deserves better than death at the hands of \\"these blasphemers.\\" It is assumed Ajak has gone back to monitoring the Dreaming Celestial. Death Later when the Celestials' Final Host arrived on Earth, Ajak along with all the Eternals killed themselves after realizing the true purpose for which they were created.Avengers (vol. 8) #4. Marvel Comics. ==Powers and abilities== Ajak possesses the standard Eternal abilities of cosmic energy manipulation and complete control of one's own cellular makeup. The physical control granted gives Eternals an indefinitely prolonged lifespan and cellular regeneration along with superhuman strength and durability, in addition to cosmic powers granting them flight, teleportation and the ability to fire energy bolts. It was revealed in Gaiman's miniseries Eternals that Ajak possesses the ability to directly communicate with the Celestials when they are nearby. ==In other media== * Ajak appears in Marvel Knights: Eternals, voiced by Kirby Morrow. * Ajak will be portrayed by Salma Hayek in the 2021 film The Eternals. ==ReferencesExternal links== * * Ajak at MarvelDirectory.com * Sersi's Loft's entry on Ajak (Archived 2009-10-24) Category:Characters created by Jack Kirby Category:Comics characters introduced in 1976 Category:Marvel Comics characters who can move at superhuman speeds Category:Marvel Comics characters who can teleport Category:Marvel Comics characters with superhuman strength Category:Eternals Category:Marvel Comics superheroes ","title":"Ajak"},{"id":"5558985","text":"\\"The Hut in the Forest\\" (also The Hut in the Wood; German: Das Waldhaus) is a German fairy tale collected by the Brothers Grimm (KHM 169).

In Hindu astrology, Makara is equivalent to the Zodiac sign Capricorn. Makara appears as the vahana (vehicle) of the river goddess Ganga, Narmada and of the sea god Varuna. Makara are considered guardians of gateways and thresholds, protecting throne rooms as well as entryways to temples; it is the most commonly recurring creature in Hindu and Buddhist temple iconography, and also frequently appears as a Gargoyle or as a spout attached to a natural spring. Makara-shaped earrings called Makarakundalas are sometimes worn by the Hindu gods, for example Shiva, the Destroyer, or the Preserver-god Vishnu, the Sun god Surya, and the Mother Goddess Chandi. Makara is also the insignia of the love god Kamadeva, who has no dedicated temples and is also known as Makaradhvaja, \\"one whose flag depicts a makara\\". ==Etymology== A crocodile- like Makara as Varuna's animal vehicle Makara is a Sanskrit word which means \\"sea dragon\\" or \\"water-monster\\". It is the origin of the Hindi word for crocodile, मगर (magar), which has in turn been loaned into English as the name of the Mugger crocodile, the most common crocodile in India. Josef Friedrich Kohl of Würzburg University and several German scientists claimed that makara is based on dugong instead, based on his reading of Jain text of Sūryaprajñapti.http://www.herenow4u.net/index.php?id=83738 The South Asian river dolphin may also have contributed to the image of the makara. In Tibetan it is called the \\"chu-srin\\", and also denotes a hybrid creature. ==Appearances== It is generally depicted as half terrestrial animal in the frontal part (stag, deer or elephant) and half aquatic animal in the hind part (usually of a fish, a seal, or a snake, though sometimes a peacock or even a floral tail is depicted). Though Makara may take many different forms throughout Hindu culture, in the modern world, its form is always related to the marsh crocodile or water monitor. According to an art historian John Boardman, depictions of Makara and Chinese Dragon might have been influenced by Kētos in Greek Mythology possibly after contact with silk-road images of the Kētos. ==Vedic depictions== During the Vedic times when Indra was the God of heaven, Varuna (the Vedic water god) became the God of the seas and rode on makara, which was called \\"the water monster vehicle\\". Celadon green-blue glazed Pottery Ewer, Molded as Makara Dragon-Fish Makara has been depicted typically as half mammal and half fish. In many temples, the depiction is in the form of half fish or seal with head of an elephant. It is also shown in an anthropomorphic (abstract form) with head and jaws of a crocodile, an elephant trunk with scales of fish and a peacock tail. Lakshmi sitting on a lotus is also a depiction in which she pulls the tongue of the elephant shaped makara is meant to project Lakshmi's image as the goddess of prosperity, wealth and well being. It represents a necessary state of chaos before the emergence of a new state of order. Makara is also the emblem of Kamadeva, the god of love and desire. Kamadeva is also known as 'Makara-Ketu' which means \\"having the makara for an emblem\\". It is the tenth sign of the Zodiac, called rāśi in Sanskrit, which is equivalent to the zodiacal sign of Capricorn (goat symbol). ==Iconography== Pradyuma Makaradhvaja The Makara, as the one found on a pillar capital at the site of the Heliodorus pillar, is associated with Pradyumna. 2nd century BCE. Gwalior Museum.Visible in the back of the image entitled \\"Lion capital – Udayagiri – 5th century\\": From the 2nd century BCE, the Makara appears to have been the symbol of Pradyumna, son of Vāsudeva Krishna. One of the epithets of Pradyumna in literature, such as in Harivamsa 99, is \\"Makaradhvaja\\", meaning \\"he whose banner or standard is the crocodile\\". A pillar capital with the effigy of a Makara crocodile found at Besnagar near the Heliodorus pillar dedicated to Vasudeva, is also attributed to Pradyumna. In the Mahabarata too, the Makara is associated with Krishna's son and Kamadeva, the God of Love, suggesting they are identical. Later Hindu iconography Row of Makara in base of Chennakesava Temple at Belur, Karnataka. Note Makara standing vertical at corner. In Hindu iconography, Makara is represented as the vahana ('vehicle') of Ganga, the river goddess. A row of makara may run along the wall of a Hindu temple, act as the hand rail of a staircase, or form an arch above a doorway. The leading Hindu temple architect and builder Ganapati Sthapati describes Makara as a mythical animal with the body of a fish, trunk of an elephant, feet of a lion, eyes of a monkey, ears of a pig, and the tail of a peacock. A more succinct explanation is provided: \\"An ancient mythological symbol, the hybrid creature is formed from a number of animals such that collectively possess the nature of a crocodile. It has the lower jaw of a crocodile, the snout or trunk of an elephant, the tusks and ears of a wild boar, the darting eyes of a monkey, the scales and the flexible body of a fish, and the swirling tailing feathers of a peacock.\\" Traditionally, a makara is considered to be an aquatic mythical creature. Makara has been depicted typically as half mammal and half fish. Some traditional accounts identify it with a crocodile, specifically the Mugger because of its etymological roots. It is depicted with the forequarters of an elephant and the hindquarters as a fish tail. Crocodile was also a form which was used in the earlier days which was shown with human body. Row of Makara in base of Chennakesava Temple at Belur, Karnataka In many temples, the depiction is in the form of half fish or seal with head of an elephant. It is also shown with head and jaws resembling a crocodile, an elephant trunk with scales of fish and a peacock tail. Other accounts identify it with Gangetic dolphin having striking resemblances with the latter, now found mainly in Vikramshila Gangetic Dolphin Sanctuary. Others portray it as a fish body with an elephant's head. The tradition identifies the makara with water, the source of all existence and fertility. In the medieval era of South India, Makara was shown as a fifth stage of development, symbolized in the form of an elephant head and body with an elaborately foliated fish tail. Most myths maintain this symbolism of this stage in the evolution of life. (Note makara in fifth row of animistic carvings in temple wall at right.) The Makara Thoranam above the door of the Garbhagriha of Chennakesava Temple at Belur. Two makaras are shown on either end of the arch. In a Hindu temple, the Makara often serves as the structural bookends of a thoranam or archway around a deity. The arch emerges up from the jaws of one Makara, rises to its peak, the Kirtimukha (the 'Face of Glory'), and descends into the gaping jaws of another Makara. Varuna is also depicted as a white man sitting on the monster makara. As a marine monster, it is also shown with the head and legs of an antelope, and the body and tail of a fish. A makara made in iron shows the monster in the form of half stag and half fish.Wilkins (2004)\\", p.373 These elements are variously joined to form one of the most common recurring themes in Indian temple iconography. In Indian art, the makara finds expression in the form of many motifs, and has been portrayed in different styles. Makara figures are placed on the entry points (Toranas) of several Buddhist monuments, including the stupa of Sanchi, a world heritage site. It is found guarding the entrances to royal thrones (see Distribution below). In the Tibetan Buddhist format it evolved from the Indian form of makara. However, it is different in some ways such as, \\"display of lions fore paws, a horse's mane, the gills and tendrils of a fish, and the horns of a deer or dragon. From its once simple fishtail, sometimes feathered, now emerges as a complex spiraling floral pattern known as makara-tail design (Sanskritmakaraketu)\\". In Tibetan iconography, it is depicted in the Vajrayana as a weapon of strength and tenacity. The Vajrayan weapons which have makara symbolism are: axe, iron hook, curved knife, vajra, and ritual dagger, in all of which the theme is \\"emergence of the blade from the open mouth of the makara\\". Makara disgorging a lion-like creature on corner of a lintel on one of the towers) surrounding the central pyramid at Bakong, Roluos, Cambodia Its symbolic representation in the form of a makara head at the corner of temple roofs is as water element which also functions as a \\"rainwater spout or gargoyle\\". It is also seen as water spouts at the source of a spring. The artistic carving in stone is in the form of identical pair of makaras flanked by two Nāgas (snake gods) along with a crown of Garuda, which is called the kirtimukha face. Such depictions are also seen at the entrance of wooden doorways as the top arch and also as a torana behind Buddha's images. The Newa art of Nepal uses this depiction extensively. In Newar architecture, its depiction is; \\"as guardian of gateways, the makara image appears on the curved prongs of the vast crossed-vajra that encompasses the four gateways of the two-dimensional mandala. Of the three dimensional-mandala this crossed-vajra supports the whole structure of the mandala palace symbolizing the immovable stability of the vajra-ground on which it stands.\\" The temples of ancient Java is notable with the application of kala-makara as both decorative and symbolic elements of temple architecture. Kala is the giant head, often took place on the top of the entrance with makaras projected on either sides of kala's head flanking the portal or projecting on top corner as antefixes. Kala-makara theme also can be found on stairs railings on either sides. On upper part of stairs, the mouth of kala's head projecting makara downward. The intricate stone carving of twin makaras flanking the lower level of stairs with its bodies forming the stair's railings. These types of stairs decorations can be observed in Borobudur and Prambanan temples. Makara's trunks are often describes as handling gold ornaments or spouting jewels, while in its mouth often projected Gana dwarf figures or animals such as lions or parrots. Makaras are also a characteristic motif of the religious Khmer architecture of the Angkor region of Cambodia which was the capital of the Khmer Empire. Makaras are usually part of the decorative carving on a lintel, tympanum, or wall. Makaras are usually depicted with another symbolic animal, such as a lion, naga or serpent, emerging from its gaping open mouth. Makara are a central design motif in the beautiful lintels of the Roluos group of temples: Preah Ko, Bakong, and Lolei. At Banteay Srei, carvings of makaras disgorging other monsters were installed on many of the buildings' corners. ==Ornaments== Lord Vishnu's earrings are shown in the form of Makara; but makarakundala can also decorate Shiva's ears.The Asian Civilisations Museum A-Z Guide to its Collections. Singapore: Editions Didier Millet, 2003, p. 300. Its contemporary usage is as ornaments in the form of bracelets in hollow silver ware inlaid with jewels for eyes and ears, which is given as a wedding gift to the bride. Some traditional account also links the Makara to the Water Monitor as both has body parts (example: jaws, meat etc.) which are stated to possess aphrodisiac properties ==Distribution== Stone sculptures of the mythological Makara and its ancient place in the iconography of Hinduism and Buddhism are widely spread throughout South Asia and Southeast Asia.

Edo period, 19th century ==Sri Lankan Mythology== Dragon Balustrade at the entrance to Jaya Sri Maha Bodhi in Anuradhapura, Sir Lanka Makara is the Sinhala term for dragon, an important figure in Sinhala Buddhist culture in Sri Lanka. It is depicted on toranas in temple architecture and objects of prestige such as in kastanes. History Since ancient time, easterners believe that Makara is one of watery creatures and even from the pre-era of the field of Buddhist art, Makara has been depicted both in work of literature and stone carvings. Makara gained a distinctive position in the Sinhala Buddhist culture - a special place not given in Buddhist artwork in other countries. In Sinhalese ancient artwork Makara has been an invented creature; it is made up of body parts of six or seven animals such as the trunk of the elephant, jaws of the crocodile, ears of the mouse or ape, extruding teeth of wild swine, the tail plume of the peacock and feet of the lion. Artistic Work The Makara is widely used in Sri Lankan Buddhist architecture, often depicted on toranas. The dragon balustrade is another kind of stone carvings which portray the Makara (dragon). These artworks used to decorate the entrance of Buddhist stupas, temples and Bo trees. There are two balustrades at main entrance of Lankatilaka Viharaya in Kandy and they are sometimes called Gajasinha balustrades because of the shape of the Makara there. The guard-stone (Muragala) has given a highest place to Makara. Over the head of the gatekeeper carved in there, the figures of Makara can be seen.Karava Makara flag from Sri Lanka with elephant/fish head and peacock tail. Sinhala-buddhist artists considered Makara as the symbol of posperity and self-sufficiency so they were not hesitant in portraying the sign of Makara in the entrance arch gateway to the religious places, such as temple, stupa or bodi. Precious examples for the above are Temple of the Tooth and Lankatilaka Temple in Kandy. Examples for the arched gateway with Makara over the image of Lord Buddha can be seen in Ridi iharaya and Dambulla cave temple. A figure of Makara has been carved to the handle of a temple key of Gadaladeniya Temple built in 1344 in Diggala in Kandy District. Kurukulam clan The Makara has also been used as a clan symbol by the Karavas and Karaiyars of Sri Lanka, who both share similar origin and were collectively known as Kurukulam. Since at least 14 century AD, they have used Makara flags in their ceremonies. Clan titles such as Aditya and Varunakulasuriyan were used by them, to indicate their connection to ancient Hindu god Varuna. ==See also== * Capricorn (astrology) * Shachihoko ==References== *Dictionary of Hindu Lore and Legend () by Anna Dallapiccola *The Illustrated Book of Signs and Symbols by Miranda Bruce-Mitford ==Bibliography== * * ==External links== Category:Hindu legendary creatures Category:Legendary reptiles Category:Fish in Buddhism Category:Tibetan Buddhist practices Category:Mythic aquatic creatures Category:Non-human races in Hindu mythology Category:Mythological hybrids Category:Dragons ","title":"Makara"},{"id":"5558999","text":"Chris Steele MBE is a British medical doctor, and the resident doctor on ITV's This Morning daytime magazine show, where he has appeared weekly since the show first aired in 1988. ==Work on nicotine addiction== Steele became interested in treating his patients who smoked in the early 1970s and is now recognised as an international expert in smoking cessation and nicotine addiction. He has lectured on this subject in over 27 countries around the world, making many media appearances. ==Fight to have nicotine gum prescriptions paid by NHS== In 1984, he was faced with a dilemma regarding the prescribing of nicotine gum (Nicorette) for smokers who wanted help in giving up their cigarettes. At that time in the UK, nicotine gum was a prescription only medicine (POM). It was in fact the only POM amongst thousands that could not be prescribed at NHS expense; in other words, it was not reimbursable under the socialised medicine system that was in effect at that time in the UK. A Department of Health committee, known as the Advisory Committee on Borderline Substances, recommended that Nicorette should not be allowed on NHS prescription, because it decreed that \\"Anti smoking preparations are not regarded as drugs.\\" Dr Steele regarded that nicotine was most certainly a drug and a powerful one at that, and so prescribed nicotine gum on NHS prescriptions for those motivated smokers who wanted to give up smoking. As a result of \\"breaking the rules\\", Steele faced various disciplinary hearings, eventually having to present his case to a Tribunal of Independent Referees. At that tribunal a statement for the Secretary of State for Health read as follows: \\"Smoking is a habit it is not a disease or condition even though It may be a contributary cause of, or may aggravate, a disease or condition such as bronchitis, carcinoma of the lung, arteriosclerosis and so on.\\" The tribunal's conclusions to \\"Is tobacco dependency a disease?\\", dated 6 July 1984, which Steele's supporters regarded as a vindication, were as follows: * \\"We find it ought to be so considered.\\" * \\"We find that nicotine prescribed for this purpose has both a pharmacological and a therapeutic effect.\\" * \\"We find that this method of treatment is the most effective that has so far been evolved.\\" ==Honours== In April 2010, Steele was awarded an MBE in recognition of his services to the medical profession and broadcasting. ==Work on ITVs This Morning== Steele has appeared on ITV's daytime magazine show This Morning since its first episode in 1988 and has remained the resident health expert since then.

On October 24, 1990, the SuperSonics traded Johnson to the Denver Nuggets for a conditional pick in the 1997 NBA draft. After playing 21 games, Johnson was waived from the Nuggets in December before signing with the San Antonio Spurs on January 17, 1991. Johnson played 47 games with seven starts for the Spurs and averaged 9.4 points, 2.1 rebounds, and 5.4 assists. In the beginning of the 1991–92 season, Johnson played 20 games and averaged 5.0 points and 6.8 assists for the Spurs before being waived in December. On January 10, 1992, Johnson signed the first of several 10-day contracts with the Houston Rockets that preceded a longer- term contract. Johnson scored a then-career-high 22 points against the Minnesota Timberwolves on January 28. Signed as an unrestricted free agent, Johnson returned to the Spurs on November 19, 1992. Promoted to starter, Johnson averaged 8.7 points, 1.9 rebounds, and 7.5 assists and improved his field goal percentage to .502 in 75 games. In the playoffs, Johnson averaged 8.2 points and 8.1 assists. Johnson signed with the Golden State Warriors on October 25, 1993 and was named team captain just nine days into his signing. Starting 70 of 82 games, Johnson reached a new career high 10.9 points per game along with 5.3 assists per game. San Antonio Spurs (1994–2001) Johnson is best known for his time with the Spurs from 1994 to 2001, and particularly his integral role on the 1998–99 Spurs team that won the NBA championship against the New York Knicks. Most notably, Johnson made the go- ahead, championship-clinching shot in Game 5 on a jumper with 47 seconds remaining in the game. The Spurs retired Johnson's number 6 on December 22, 2007. He was also inducted into the San Antonio Sports Hall of Fame on February 20, 2009. After the Spurs On July 19, 2001, Johnson signed as a free agent with the Denver Nuggets. Johnson played 51 games (13 starts) with the Nuggets and averaged 9.4 points, 1.3 rebounds, and 5.1 assists. The Nuggets traded Johnson and three other players to the Dallas Mavericks on February 21, 2002. Johnson played 17 games all as a reserve with the Mavericks for the rest of the season. In the 2002–03 season, Johnson played in 48 games as a reserve for the Mavericks, averaging 9.0 minutes per game. Johnson ended his NBA career in the 2003–04 season back with the Golden State Warriors. He played 46 games with one start and averaged 4.6 points, 0.7 rebounds, and 2.4 assists. ==Post-playing career== Dallas Mavericks On October 28, 2004, Johnson retired from playing and signed as an assistant coach with the Dallas Mavericks under Don Nelson. Johnson had played under Nelson from 2001 to 2003, and it was understood from the beginning that he was being groomed to eventually succeed Nelson as head coach. His transition from assistant to head coach came five months later on March 19, 2005, after Nelson resigned. Under Johnson, the Mavericks closed out the 2004–05 season with a 16–2 run and a first-round playoff victory over the Houston Rockets, before being eliminated by the Phoenix Suns in the second round of the playoffs. Johnson was named the April 2005 NBA Coach of the Month, only one month after becoming a head coach for the first time. Johnson as the head coach of the Mavs, 2008 The 2005–06 season was even more successful for Johnson and was marked by a series of milestones. In November 2005, Johnson won his second NBA Coach of the Month award (which was also his second consecutive award, following the one he had won in April the previous season), making him the first NBA coach to win the award in his first two months as a head coach. On January 28, 2006, when the Dallas Mavericks defeated the Utah Jazz, Johnson's record as head coach improved to 50–12, making Johnson the fastest coach to reach 50 wins. In February 2006, he was chosen to coach the 2006 NBA All-Star team for the Western Conference. Although Johnson ultimately led the Mavericks to the second-best record in the Western Conference, the team entered the playoffs as the fourth seed in the West due to the structure of the 2006 NBA Playoffs seeding. In April 2006, Johnson was rewarded for his success throughout the season with the 2006 NBA Coach of the Year Award. In June 2006, after defeating the Memphis Grizzlies, the defending champion San Antonio Spurs, and the Phoenix Suns in the first three rounds of the playoffs, Johnson led the Mavericks to their first ever NBA Finals appearance. However, the Mavs were defeated in six games by the Miami Heat, losing four straight after winning the first two games. On December 31, 2006, Johnson became the fastest head coach (at the time) to win 100 games when his squad defeated the Denver Nuggets. This record was later broken by Tom Thibodeau and the Chicago Bulls. In the 2006–07 season, Johnson's Mavericks had the best record in the NBA with 67 wins and entered the playoffs as the top seed. However, his Mavericks lost to the eighth-seeded Golden State Warriors, led by former Mavericks head coach Don Nelson, in one of the biggest upsets in recent NBA history. With the Mavs' win over the Grizzlies on November 18, 2007, Johnson became the fastest coach to reach 150 wins. Following the 2007–08 season, the Mavericks under Johnson were eliminated in the first round of the playoffs for the second year in a row. A day later, on April 30, 2008, Johnson was dismissed as head coach of the Mavericks and replaced by former NBA Coach of the Year, Rick Carlisle.ESPN – Mavs, Johnson part ways after team's playoff ouster – NBAMAVERICKS: Avery Johnson dismissed as coachMAVERICKS: Official release: Mavericks relieve Avery Johnson of coaching duties First stint at ESPN On October 17, 2008, Johnson joined ESPN as a studio analyst.

New Jersey/Brooklyn Nets On June 10, 2010, Johnson was hired as head coach of the New Jersey Nets, which had just finished a dismal 2009–10 campaign with a 12–70 record. In his first year as coach of the Nets, the team improved slightly, doubling its win total from the previous season and finishing 24–58. However, the next year saw no such improvement, as his team went 22–44 in the lockout-shortened season. Johnson remained with the Nets when the team moved to Brooklyn in 2012. He was named the Eastern Conference Coach of the Month for October and November 2012 following an 11–4 start to the season. Despite that early success, the team went on to lose ten of its next 13 games, and subsequently Johnson was fired from his head coaching position on December 27, 2012.

In the context of Jain and Hindu mythology, it is believed to be a cosmic column which functions as a bond, which joins the heaven (Svarga) and the earth (Prithvi). A number of Hindu scriptures, including the Atharva Veda, have references to Stambhas. In the Atharva Veda, a celestial stambha has been described as an infinite scaffold, which supports the cosmos and material creation. A Stambha was and is also used in the context of Indian architecture. Different Stambhas serve different purpose, including the following: * Dhvaja Stambha – flagstaffs that are placed opposite the main shrine, on an axis with the main deity. * Kirti Stambha & Vijaya Stambha – erected to commemorate victories. * The most well known stambhas of India are the Ashoka Stambha (Pillars of Ashoka) erected during the reign of Ashoka, spread across the subcontinent, and which bear different types of royal edicts. * Adi Purana – a huge manastambha stands in front of the samavasarana of the tirthankaras, which causes someone entering a samavasarana to shed their pride. ==Gallery== File:Tower_of_victory.jpgVijay Stambha at Chittorgarh fort File:Hutessing Temple3 Ahmedabad.JPGKirti Stambh of Hutheesing Jain Temple File:Ashoka pillar at Vaishali, Bihar, India.jpgAshoka Pillar ==See also== * Related topics ** Hutheesing Jain Temple ** Ashoka's Major Rock Edicts ** Dhar iron pillar ** History of metallurgy in South Asia ** Iron pillar of Delhi ** Pillars of Ashoka ** Heliodorus pillar * Other similar topics ** Early Indian epigraphy ** Indian rock-cut architecture ** List of rock-cut temples in India ** Outline of ancient India ** South Indian Inscriptions ** Tagundaing ==References== *Dictionary of Hindu Lore and Legend () by Anna Dallapiccola Category:Hindu architecture Category:Hindu mythology ","title":"Stambha"},{"id":"5559058","text":"Barbarella may refer to: ==Arts and media== Music * Barbarella (band), a Dutch female pop trio * Barbarellas, Irish pop duo * Barbarella (song), a 1983 song by the Bongos. * Barbarella (festival), a Dominican electronic music festival * \\"Barbarella\\" (song), a song by Scott Weiland from 12 Bar Blues * \\"Barbarella\\", a song by Alisha's Attic from Illumina Musicals * Barbarella (musical) a 2004 musical based on the film * Barbarella: the 80's Musical, a 2015 musical Other uses in arts and media * Barbarella (character) a fictional character created by Jean-Claude Forest ** Barbarella (film) a 1968 film based on the comic book; starring Jane Fonda ==Nightclubs== * Barbarella (Portland, Oregon), U.S. * Barbarella (Växjö), Sweden * Barbarella's, a nightclub in Birmingham ==Other uses== * Barbarella (rocket), a German hybrid rocket launched from the Barbara drilling platform in the Baltic Sea * Tommy Barbarella, a musician with New Power Generation ==See also== * Barbara (given name) ","title":"Barbarella"},{"id":"5559068","text":"The Shri Guru Ravidas Mission London (originally known as Shri Guru Ravidas Sabha – East London) is a registered religious charity.

In 2019, it was announced that Angelina Jolie would be playing Thena in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, debuting in Eternals (2021). ==Publication history== Thena first appeared in The Eternals #5 (November 1976). Marvel Comics continuity was later retconned so that the character presented as the mythological god Minerva, introduced in Red Raven Comics #1 (August 1940), was, in fact, Thena. The character appeared in the ongoing series The Eternals Vol.1, written by Jack Kirby and later in a Thor storyline that ran from Thor #291-301,.Thor Annual #7 (1978) and Thor #291-301 (May 1979 - Nov. 1980) She become one of the main characters of the Eternals Vol.2 in 1985 written by Peter B.

Originally named Azura, but her father Zuras had her name changed by royal decree to resemble that of Zeus' daughter Athena (Roman name Minerva) to seal the treaty between the Olympian gods and the Eternals, in which the Eternals would act as the gods representatives on Earth, with Thena serving as Athena's personal representative. Due to this, she has often been mistaken for Athena and Minerva. The city of Athens was apparently built for her, not the goddess, although Thena later allowed it to be conquered by the Spartans in 404 B.C. Thena became a scholar and a warrior as she grew. She encountered Kro in Babylon 2,500 years ago. He had a chance to slay her, but did not; as the years passed, the two of them grew closer together. Thena and Kro made love during the Vietnam War, resulting in Thena becoming pregnant with twins. She placed them inside of Ms. Ritter, an infertile woman, who raised them as her own twin children, Donald and Deborah.revealed in Eternals: The Herod Factor #1  Modern Age  In recent times, the eternals and deviants revealed themselves to the human world. When Warlord Kro led his armies in an attack on New York City, Thena opposed him to help rescue Sersi. Thena was reunited with Kro, and publicly declared herself to be an Eternal.Eternals Vol. 1 #5 After Kro called a truce, he brought her to the Deviant city of Lemuria to try to resume his relationship with her. However Thenas was horrified with the Deviants' customs including the mass killing of undesirables. Thena meet Brother Tode, the leader of the deviants and watched a gladiator match between Deviant champions.Eternals Vol. 1 #6-7 She watched that Ransak the Reject, a genetically stable Deviant was fighting the horribly mutated but well-mannered Karkas. Thena was convinced by Karkas to grant both of them sanctuary and take them under her protection, running away from Lemuria with them. She then participated in the Uni-Mind with other Eternals to decide what to do with the Celestial crisis.Eternals Vol. 1 #8-12 With Karkas and the Reject, she battled Zakka and Tutinax.Eternals Annual #1 She met and became an ally of Thor,Thor #285-289 and then battled Athena of Olympus, during a battle between the Olympian gods and Eternals.Thor #291-292 and then battled Athena of Olympus, during a battle between the Olympian gods and Eternals.Thor #291-292 She and the rest of the Etenals were captured by the Deviants aristocracy, but were rescued by Iron Man (James Rhodes).

Thena was angry when few eternals assisted to his crowning ceremony.Eternals Vol. 2 #1 In a new conflict with the deviants, Thena meet Kro again and helped him to escape from High Priest Ghaur 's control. She thwarted the other Eternals' efforts against Kro and turned against Ikaris to help save Kro's life, but later relinquished her title to Ikaris after a ceremony, and was banished. She was captured with Kro by Ghaur, and freed from Kro's brain mine; when she learned of the Brain-Mine, she was furious with Kro.

McCollum, the winner of a $250 contest held by The Augusta Chronicle to generate the best name for the area. Today the initialism is so commonly used that the full name is not known to all residents. The region is located on and named after the Savannah River, which forms the border between the two states. The largest cities within the CSRA are Augusta, Georgia and Aiken, South Carolina.

Upon leaving Hotwells, the line ran north alongside the River Avon through two tunnels, to a halt and passing point, then to Sneyd Park Junction, where the Clifton Extension Railway joined it. Continuing north following the river is the station at , then a bridge over the River Trym. The line curved west around Horse-Shoe Bend, then went slightly inland to , then turned back north-west. At Avonmouth Dock Junction the Extension Railway diverged north, and another line diverged west for freight, while the BPRP line continued into the station at . Beyond there, the line diverged again, with one line going west to and another north to rejoin the Extension Railway. The main BPRP line continued on into its Avonmouth terminus. ==History== Formation Bristol sits on the River Avon, with its docks several miles inland. By the 19th century, ships had grown to such a size that navigating the Avon was not possible any more, and they had to dock at the head of the river at Avonmouth instead. The Bristol Port Railway and Pier company (BPRP) was founded in 1862 with the intent to build a single-track railway the from Avonmouth to the city centre, alongside the Avon. The railway's act of parliament was passed on 17 July 1862, with Benjamin Burleigh appointed as engineer. It was the first standard gauge line in Bristol. The company's headquarters was at , where the first sod was turned by the Mayoress of Bristol, Mrs S V Hare, on 19 February 1863. The railway opened on 6 March 1865, although this was not announced in advance so that the line would not be overwhelmed by more people than the single locomotive could haul, and timetables were posted at Hotwells only minutes before the first departure. Connection to the network As built, the railway was isolated from the rest of the national network, having not been intended for anything more than local traffic. However, with very little goods traffic, a connection to the main line railways was needed to develop Avonmouth as a port. An extension from Hotwells to the city's main station at Temple Meads would have required crossing a large amount of developed land, and so was prohibitively expensive. Instead, a link was proposed from the BPRP at Sneyd Park, running under Clifton Down to join the Midland Railway and Bristol and South Wales Union Railway. The connection was authorised in 1867, but the BPRP was in financial difficulties and unable to attract investors. Instead, the company joined forces with the Midland and Great Western Railways to build the Clifton Extension Railway, which opened in 1877 for freight to the newly built Avonmouth Docks. The double-track CER was not initially open to passengers, as although the Sneyd Park – section was certified for passenger use in 1878, the MR and GWR did not believe the BPRP line was in a suitable state to carry their passengers. The MR obtained parliamentary powers to install block signalling on the line at the BPRP's expense, and through trains eventually started on 1 September 1885. Buyout and legacy was built during the First World War. On 25 July 1890, Parliament approved a bill allowing the Midland and Great Western to buy out the BPRP, the BPRP effectively merging with the Clifton Extension Railway from 1 September that year. Increased traffic led to the line being doubled from Avonmouth to Shirehampton in 1903, and to Sneyd Park in 1907. The Avonmouth terminus closed to passengers in 1902 to allow construction of the Royal Edward Dock, although workers' trains continued into 1903. Traffic on the Hotwells branch peaked in 1910 at ten trains per day and six on Sundays, and in 1917 was built to handle the large number of wartime munitions workers travelling to Avonmouth. The branch was closed in 1922 to make way for construction of the A4 Portway. The line from Sneyd Park Junction to Dock Junction and the stations of Shirehampton and Sea Mills survive as part of the Severn Beach Line. Portnalls Number One Railway Tunnel, just north of Hotwells station, was used during the Second World War as an air-raid shelter by the people of Bristol. It became so popular that the City Council had to institute a pass system. The tunnel was once again used in the late twentieth century by the Bristol Gun Club, who converted a portion of it into a firing range. However, this ended following the passage of the Firearms (Amendment) (No. 2) Act 1997 which banned handguns in the United Kingdom, and the tunnel was once more abandoned. It is currently split in three parts – the firing range, a section of original tunnel, and the shelter. In the 2000s subsidence and movement in the Number Two tunnel affected the road above, Bridge Valley Road, which required major stabilization work and the waterproof tanking of the tunnel, to enable the road to be reopened. ==Services== Initial service from March 1865 was six trains per day in each direction, with four down (Hotwells to Avonmouth) and five up (Avonmouth to Hotwells) on Sundays, taking around 30 minutes for the trip. On weekdays the quickest was 26 minutes, and 20 minutes on Sundays as Shirehampton was closed due to objections from the local church, although this concession was reversed by May that year. The fare for a single between Hotwells and Avonmouth was 1s 0d, 9d and 6d for first, second and third class respectively, with returns 6d more. By January 1866 the service was reduced to three down and four up per day, with one Shirehampton-Avonmouth except on Sundays; this increased to five up and down in April that year, with one Hotwells-Shirehampton except on Sundays. By June the service was five up and down on Sundays, and six on other days. Two extra trains per day were laid on when was opened, and by summer 1887 there were ten up and down, with four each way and an Avonmouth- Shirehampton return on Sundays. By 1910 Avonmouth was no longer a resort, but instead a workplace, and so Sunday service was reduced to two trains each way, taking 19 minutes each. The Sunday service had been completely discontinued by 1920, with weekday service reduced to nine down and eight up, with journey times of 18 minutes, and the first two morning departures forsaking the Hotwells terminus for Hotwells Halt's longer platform. From September 1921, the Halt was the terminus of the BPRP line, as the Hotwells terminus was closed to allow construction of the A4 Portway. Hotwells Halt, and the line to Sneyd Park Junction, closed on 3 July 1922, with the final train running on 1 July. According to some sources, the trains were not operated by the BPRP itself, but instead were operated under a lease agreement by the Bristol and Exeter Railway. This lease was taken over by the Great Western Railway in 1871, along with the rest of the Bristol and Exeter. ==Rolling stock== The BPRP had two 0-4-2 side tank locomotives, possibly from the St Helens Railway. Coaching stock was four-wheeled; there were initially 14 carriages, rising to around 20 according to some reports, all of which were disposed of when the line was taken over. The BPRP also possessed two covered and two uncovered wagons, in a light grey livery. The coaching stock was painted yellow and white, with some later painted dark chocolate. ==See also== *Rail transport in Bristol ==References== * * * ==External links== * Category:Rail transport in Bristol Category:Transport in South Gloucestershire District Category:Railway lines opened in 1865 Category:Closed railway lines in South West England Category:Standard gauge railways in England Category:Railway lines closed in 1922 ","title":"Bristol Port Railway and Pier"},{"id":"5559110","text":"Bedara Kannappa is a 1954 Indian Kannada-language film directed by H.

The development of the Do 31 was motivated principally by heavy interest expressed by the German Air Force in the acquisition of short take-off and vertical landing aircraft (STOVL)-capable aircraft. Such ambitions received a further boost from the issuing of NATO specification NBMR-4, which called for a VTOL-capable tactical support aircraft that would be operated in conjunction with the EWR VJ 101, a West German VTOL strike aircraft designed under the NATO contract of BMR-3.Jackson 1976, p. 143. A total of three aircraft, two flight-capable and one static airframe, were constructed and used for testing. On 10 February 1967, the Do 31 performed its maiden flight; the first hovering flight of the type took place during July 1967. In addition to performing test flights, Dornier often demonstrated the Do 31 prototypes to officials and the general public, such as at the 1969 Paris Air Show. Several world records were set by the type during its limited flying career. When the high cost, technical and logistical difficulties of operating such an aircraft were realized, the German Air Force opted to cease trials involving VTOL aircraft, such as the Do 31, VJ101, and the later VFW VAK 191B. In the face of limited sales prospects and a lack of state support, the Do 31 and other VTOL projects lingered as research projects for a time prior to their manufacturers abandoning all activity. The Do 31 remains the only VTOL-capable jet-powered transport aircraft to ever fly. ==Design and development== Background During the late 1950s and 1960s, the German Air Force became increasingly concerned that, in the event of a major conflict with the Eastern Bloc, its airfields would be highly vulnerable to attack, quickly preventing the use of conventional aircraft in any such conflict. Seeking to counter this threat, the service actively researched the possibility of dispersed operations; one of the options was the use of the nation's Autobahnens, which necessitated such aircraft to possess short take- off and vertical landing aircraft (STOVL) capabilities. Due to this interest, a series of trials were conducted, which involved the modification of several German Air Force Lockheed F-104 Starfighters so that they could be rocket- launched from stationary ramps; these trials became known as the zero length launch (ZELL) programme. The Starfighters were to be recovered to short strips using aircraft carrier-type arresting gear; similarly, the later Do 31 was intended to use these same austere air strips as forward operating bases.Jackson 1976, p. 29. As early as 1959, West German aircraft manufacturer Dornier had been informally working on several VTOL-related concepts, although it would not be until 1961 that the design team would formalise what would become the Do 31.Hirschel, Prem and Madelung 2012, p. 375. Early activity centred around a series of studies on the topic of a VTOL-capable utility transport aircraft. Dornier's design team, based at the company's facility in Friedrichshafen, was headed by the aeronautical engineer Gustav Wieland. Already at this stage, Dornier was liaising with foreign companies, including British engine manufacturer Bristol Siddeley, who were independently working on their own VTOL-orientated engine already. The design of the flight control system was considered to be a critical element of any aircraft performing vertical flight, particularly in how it handled control failures.Hirschel, Prem and Madelung 2012, p. 380. To support the development programme, a purpose-built flight control test rig was constructed by Dornier, which allowed their design team to explore and evaluate different attitude control laws and flying qualities.Hirschel, Prem and Madelung 2012, p. 611.Dow 2009, pp. 237-238. To solve the differential equations necessary to model the aircraft in detail, the Dornier DO-960 hybrid computer was developed.\\"The Dornier DO-960 Analog Computer.\\" vaxman.de, Retrieved: 5 August 2019. In spite of allowances to facilitate control during vertical flight, the flight control philosophy used upon the Do 31 was more akin to a conventional aircraft than that of a helicopter.Dow 2009, p. 239. Programme launch and design Fairings at the top of a lift nacelle in the open position During February 1962, the formal launch of the Do 31 programme occurred with the issuing of a development contract from the West German government.Dow 2009, p. 233. By the start of 1964, Dornier had started building a pair of prototype aircraft; their manufacture was largely performed at the company's Oberpfaffenhofen plant.Hoffert, Fritz. \\"The Dornier DO 31 Jet-Lift Concept, A Light Military Transport with VTOL Capability.\\" SAE Technical Paper 640229, 1964.Dow 2009, p. 236. A total of three test prototypes were constructed, these being E1, E2 and E3 - the \\"E\\" indicating Experimentell (Experimental). E1 was powered only by the Pegasus engines, having been designed to test horizontal flight. E2 was a static test airframe, and did not ever fly. E3 was furnished with both Pegasus and RB162 lift engines installed, being intended to evaluate the design's vertical flight mode. The four Rolls-Royce RB162 lift engines seen from the bottom of a nacelle The design of the Do 31 was heavily reliant upon its engine configuration. Dornier had opted to incorporate the British-built Bristol PegasusBy the time of the first flight, Rolls-Royce had taken over Bristol Engines. vectored-thrust turbofan engine, an existing powerplant that was most famously used to power the Harrier Jump Jet. On the Do 31, a pair of Pegasus engines were housed in each of the two inboard nacelles; during the vertical phase of flight, additional lift was provided by an arrangement of four vertically mounted Rolls-Royce RB162 lift engines located in each of the outer nacelles.Dow 2009, pp. 233-234. Cargo area By mounting the engines in pods, the fuselage could accommodate a capacious hold for storing cargo, which was primarily accessed via a rear-facing loading ramp. Early designs of the Do 31 used more than four Rolls-Royce RB162s; the availability of more powerful versions of the Pegasus engine enabled the reduction to four supplemental lift engines.Dow 2009, p. 234. Due to the engines being placed in nacelles, as opposed to within the fuselage as on the Harrier, the Pegasus had to be specially modified for the Do 31.Dow 2009, pp. 234-235. Pitch control nozzles in the tail, fed from the Pegasus engines, two pointing up, two pointing down Beyond providing adequate lift and control, other factors influenced the propulsion system. According to Dow, noise was a considerable concern, particularly as the airframe's critical frequency was close to that which was naturally generated by the lift engines.Dow 2009, p. 246. The re-ingestion of hot exhaust gasses was another critical area, complicated by there being 16 'fountains' of gas being generated during vertical hover, 12 of which being hot. Following intense study during the flight testing phase of development, it was determined that positioning the nozzles at an angle of 85-degrees, rather than 90-degrees, was sufficient to avoid encountering any issue during takeoff, while no such issues were observed during landings at all.Dow 2009, pp. 246-247. Several different types of air intakes were also trialled, both to deter ingestion issues and the uneven start-up of the lift engines. Bleed air was also drawn from the Pegasus engines to the lift engines as a measure to address ingestion issues, while dedicated studies were performed on ground erosion effects.Dow 2009, p. 247. Into flight On 10 February 1967, the first prototype (E1) conducted its maiden flight, powered by just the two Pegasus engines. During July 1967, the third prototype (E3), which was furnished with all ten of its engines, performed the first hovering flight. During December 1967, forward-and-backward transitions between vertical and horizontal phases of flight were successfully conducted. On 28 February 1968, the first flight involving multiple transitions was performed. According to aviation author Andrew Dow, while some initial teething issues were encountered, confidence in the aircraft grew quickly.Dow 2009, pp. 246-248. As the flight envelope was explored, test pilot Drudy Wood performed several exploratory manoeuvres while flying the Do 31, on one occasion deliberately flying it backwards to prove it could be done and performing a barrel roll on another.Dow 2009, pp. 248-249. Seeking to garner publicity for its new aircraft, Dornier flew the one of the prototypes to the 1969 Paris Air Show, where it was demonstrated to the general public. The ferry flight to reach the event established multiple Fédération Aéronautique Internationale (FAI) world records for the type.\\"FAI Record ID #5536 - Speed over a recognized course, München - Paris.

Public recognition was viewed as particularly valuable in light of Dornier's long-term ambitions for the Do 31, as the company foresaw civilian uses for the aircraft as a commercial VTOL transport.Dow 2009, p. 250. At one point, Dornier was negotiating with both Douglas Aircraft and Ling-Temco-Vought (LTV) for involvement in the Do 31 programme, even rejecting one approach made by Douglas.Dow 2009, pp. 250-251. Model of the unrealised prototype Do 131 The Do 31 was the first, and so far only, vertical takeoff jet transport ever built. During April 1970, it was announced that the project had been terminated, although the Do 31 performed its final public flight on 4 May 1970 during the Internationale Luft- und Raumfahrtausstellung (ILA) in Hannover.Hirschel, Prem and Madelung 2012, pp. 375-376. One of the alleged contributing factors towards the Do 31's cancellation was the relatively large drag and weight imposed by the lift engine pods, which reduced both the useful payload and range of the type compared to conventional transport aircraft. According to Dow, the German government had been frustrated by a lack of commitment forthcoming from other NATO countries, and was unwilling to contribute alone to the high funding requirement needs for full-scale development. During a later stage of development, Dornier planned to dispense with the Do 31's outer nacelles and their engines; in their place, larger RB153 turbofan engines, each capable of generating approximately of thrust, would have been adopted once this powerplant had become available. A further development of the Do 31, referred to as the Do 131, intended to be powered by either twelve or fourteen liftjets, was also explored by Dornier; however, no prototype of this variant was ever constructed.Dornier: die Chronik des ältesten deutschen Flugzeugwerks.

He moved to the league rivals Rot-Weiss Essen in the summer of 2002 and subsequently spent two seasons with club as their first-choice goalkeeper. In 2004, Kirschstein was signed by Bundesliga side Hamburger SV to serve as understudy to Martin Pieckenhagen and Stefan Wächter. He did not play in the Bundesliga during his first season with the club, but made 12 Regionalliga Nord appearances for Hamburg's reserve team. Kirschstein eventually made his Bundesliga debut against Bayer 04 Leverkusen on 26 November 2005, following an injury to Wächter, and secured his place in the starting XI with a string of impressive performances in the second half of the season. He was initially chosen as Hamburg's first-choice goalkeeper for the 2006–07 season and also made his UEFA Champions League debut against Arsenal on 13 September 2006. However, he was sent off only 10 minutes into the game. Despite that, he remained Hamburg's first choice in the Bundesliga and made two more Champions League appearances, before eventually being replaced by Wächter in early November 2006. During the winter break of the 2006–07 season, Hamburg signed Frank Rost as their new first-choice goalkeeper and Kirschstein was eventually sent on a two-season loan to 2. Bundesliga side Greuther Fürth in the summer of 2007. At Greuther Fürth, he established himself as the first-choice goalkeeper and only missed one league match during the entire season due to a yellow-card suspension. On 4 April 2009, he signed a contract with SC Paderborn 07. On 24 June 2009, the contract was canceled and he signed a one-year contract for Rot-Weiss Ahlen.

Common connector types  8P8C, LC, SC, ST } The Ethernet physical layer is the physical layer functionality of the Ethernet family of computer network standards. The physical layer defines the electrical or optical properties of the physical connection between a device and the network or between network devices. It is complemented by the MAC layer and the logical link layer. The Ethernet physical layer has evolved over its existence starting in 1980 and encompasses multiple physical media interfaces and several orders of magnitude of speed from 1 Mbit/s to 400 Gbit/s. The physical medium ranges from bulky coaxial cable to twisted pair and optical fiber with a standardized reach of up to 40 km. In general, network protocol stack software will work similarly on all physical layers. Many Ethernet adapters and switch ports support multiple speeds by using autonegotiation to set the speed and duplex for the best values supported by both connected devices. If autonegotiation fails, some multiple-speed devices sense the speed used by their partner, but this may result in a duplex mismatch. With rare exceptions, a 100BASE-TX port (10/100) also supports 10BASE-T while a 1000BASE-T port (10/100/1000) also supports 10BASE-T and 100BASE-TX. Most 10GBASE-T ports also support 1000BASE-T, some even 100BASE-TX or 10BASE-T. While autonegotiation can practically be relied on for Ethernet over twisted pair, few optical-fiber ports support multiple speeds. In any case, even multi-rate fiber interfaces only support a single wavelength (e.g. 850 nm for 1000BASE-SX or 10GBASE-SR). 10 Gigabit Ethernet was already used in both enterprise and carrier networks by 2007, with 40 Gbit/s and 100 Gigabit Ethernet ratified. In 2017, the fastest additions to the Ethernet family were 200 and 400 Gbit/s. ==Naming conventions== Generally, layers are named by their specifications:IEEE 802.3 1.2.3 Physical layer and media notation * 10, 100, 1000, 10G, ... – the nominal, usable speed at the top of the physical layer (no suffix = megabit/s, G = gigabit/s), excluding line codes but including other physical layer overhead (preamble, SFD, IPG); some WAN PHYs (W) run at slightly reduced bitrates for compatibility reasons; encoded PHY sublayers usually run at higher bitrates * BASE, BROAD, PASS – indicates baseband, broadband, or passband signaling respectively * -T, -S, -L, -E, -Z, -C, -K, -H ... – medium (PMD): T = twisted pair, S = 850 nm short wavelength (multi-mode fiber), L = 1300 nm long wavelength (mostly single-mode fiber), E or Z = 1500 nm extra long wavelength (single-mode), B = bidirectional fiber (mostly single-mode) using WDM, P = passive optical (PON), C = copper/twinax, K = backplane, 2 or 5 or 36 = coax with 185/500/3600 m reach (obsolete), F = fiber, various wavelengths, H = plastic optical fiber * X, R – PCS encoding method (varying with the generation): X for 8b/10b block encoding (4B5B for Fast Ethernet), R for large block encoding (64b/66b) * 1, 2, 4, 10 – for LAN PHYs indicates number of lanes used per link; for WAN PHYs indicates reach in kilometers For 10 Mbit/s, no encoding is indicated as all variants use Manchester code. Most twisted pair layers use unique encoding, so most often just -T is used. The reach, especially for optical connections, is defined as the maximum achievable link length that is guaranteed to work when all channel parameters are met (modal bandwidth, attenuation, insertion losses etc). With better channel parameters, often a longer, stable link length can be achieved. Vice versa, a link with worse channel parameters can also work but only over a shorter distance. Reach and maximum distance have the same meaning. ==Physical layers== The following sections provide a brief summary of official Ethernet media types. In addition to these official standards, many vendors have implemented proprietary media types for various reasons--often to support longer distances over fiber optic cabling. Early implementations and 10 Mbit/s Early Ethernet standards used Manchester coding so that the signal was self-clocking and not adversely affected by high-pass filters. {  - !Name !Standard (Clause) !Common connectors !Link reach !Required cable !Description - ! colspan=6 style=\\"background-color: #F0F1F4\\"  Coaxial cable - Xerox experimental Ethernet Proprietary Vampire tap 1 km 75 Ω coaxial The original 2.94 Mbit/s Ethernet implementation had eight- bit addresses and other differences in frame format. - 10BASE5  (8) AUI, N, vampire tap 500 m RG-8X Original standard uses a single coaxial cable in which a connection is made by tapping into the single cable, drilling in to make contact with the core and the screen.

In 2008, Robert Metcalfe, one of the co-inventors of Ethernet, said he believed commercial applications using Terabit Ethernet may occur by 2015, though it might require new Ethernet standards. It was predicted this would be followed rapidly by a scaling to 100 Terabit, possibly as early as 2020. It is worth noting that these were theoretical predictions of technological ability, rather than estimates of when such speeds would actually become available at a practical price point. {  - !Name !Standard (Clause) !Common connectors !Description - ! colspan=4 style=\\"background-color: #F0F1F4\\"  Fiber-optical cable -  400GBASE-SR16   MPO  sixteen lanes (26.5625 Gbit/s) using individual strands of OM4/OM5 multi-mode fiber with 100 m reach or 70 m over OM3 -  400GBASE-DR4   MPO  four PAM-4 lanes (53.125 GBd) using individual strands of single-mode fiber with 500 m reach (1310 nm) -  400GBASE-FR8   SC, LC  eight PAM-4 lanes (26.5625 GBd) using eight wavelengths (CWDM) over single-mode fiber with 2 km reach -  400GBASE-LR8   SC, LC  eight PAM-4 lanes (26.5625 GBd) using eight wavelengths (DWDM) over single-mode fiber with 10 km reach -  400GBASE-FR4  rowspan=2  ''''  rowspan=2  SC, LC  four lanes/wavelengths (CWDM, 1271/1291/1311/1331 nm) over single-mode fiber with 2 km reach -  400GBASE-LR4  four lanes over single-mode fiber with 10 km reach -  400GBASE-SR8   rowspan=2  SC, LC  eight-lane using individual strands of multi-mode fiber with 100 m reach -  400GBASE-SR4.2   four-lane using individual strands of multi-mode fiber with 100 m reach -  400GBASE- ER8   SC, LC  eight-lane using eight wavelengths over single-mode fiber with 40 km reach -  400GBASE-ZR  (155 & 156)  SC, LC  at least 80 km over single-mode fiber using a single wavelength with 16QAM over a DWDM system - ! colspan=4 style=\\"background-color: #F0F1F4\\"  Other -  400GBASE-KR4  rowspan=2    four-lane over electrical backplanes supporting an insertion loss of up to 28 dB at 26.56 GBd -  400GBASE-CR4   four-lane over twin- axial copper with at least 2 m reach } 800 Gbit/s The Ethernet Technology Consortium (former 25 Gigabit Ethernet Consortium) proposed an 800 Gbit/s Ethernet PCS variant based on tightly bundled 400GBASE-R in April 2020. {  - !Name !Standard (Clause) !Common connectors !Description -  800GBASE-R    , the PCS and PMA sublayers seem to be defined, using eight lanes of 100 Gbit/s each, and connecting with the transceiver module through a C2M or C2C interface, being defined in 802.3ck. } First mile For providing Internet access service directly from providers to homes and small businesses: {  - !

For Ethernet, the bit rate at the top of the PCS is the nominal bit rate, e.g. 10 Mbit/s for classic Ethernet or 1000 Mbit/s for Gigabit Ethernet. * PMA (Physical Medium Attachment sublayer) - This sublayer performs PMA framing, octet synchronization/detection, and polynomial scrambling/descrambling. * PMD (Physical Medium Dependent sublayer) - This sublayer consists of a transceiver for the physical medium. ==Twisted-pair cable== Several varieties of Ethernet were specifically designed to run over 4-pair copper structured cabling already installed in many locations. In a departure from both 10BASE-T and 100BASE-TX, 1000BASE-T and above use all four cable pairs for simultaneous transmission in both directions through the use of echo cancellation. Using point-to-point copper cabling provides the opportunity to transmit low electrical power along with the data. This is called Power over Ethernet and there are several, incremental IEEE 802.3 standards. Combining 10BASE-T (or 100BASE-TX) with \\"Mode A\\" allows a hub or a switch to transmit both power and data over only two pairs. This was designed to leave the other two pairs free for analog telephone signals. The pins used in \\"Mode B\\" supply power over the \\"spare\\" pairs not used by 10BASE-T and 100BASE-TX. \\"4PPoE\\" defined in IEEE 802.3bt can use all four pairs to supply up to 100 W. {  + 8P8C wiring (MDI) !

Generally, faster speeds require both higher-grade cables and more sophisticated encoding. Comparison of twisted pair based ethernet technologies ==Minimum cable lengths== Fiber connections have minimum cable lengths due to level requirements on received signals. Fiber ports designed for long-haul wavelengths require a signal attenuator if used within a building. 10BASE2 installations, running on RG-58 coaxial cable, require a minimum of 0.5 m between stations tapped into the network cable, this is to minimize reflections. 10BASE-T, 100BASE-T, and 1000BASE-T installations running on twisted pair cable use a star topology. No minimum cable length is required for these networks. ==Related standards== Some networking standards are not part of the IEEE 802.3 Ethernet standard, but support the Ethernet frame format, and are capable of interoperating with it. *LattisNet—A SynOptics pre-standard twisted-pair 10 Mbit/s variant. *100BaseVG—An early contender for 100 Mbit/s Ethernet. It runs over Category 3 cabling. Uses four pairs. Commercial failure. *TIA 100BASE-SX—Promoted by the Telecommunications Industry Association. 100BASE-SX is an alternative implementation of 100 Mbit/s Ethernet over fiber; it is incompatible with the official 100BASE-FX standard. Its main feature is interoperability with 10BASE-FL, supporting autonegotiation between 10 Mbit/s and 100 Mbit/s operation – a feature lacking in the official standards due to the use of differing LED wavelengths. It is targeted at the installed base of 10 Mbit/s fiber network installations. *TIA 1000BASE-TX—Promoted by the Telecommunications Industry Association, it was a commercial failure, and no products exist. 1000BASE-TX uses a simpler protocol than the official 1000BASE-T standard so the electronics can be cheaper, but requires Category 6 cabling. *G.hn—A standard developed by ITU-T and promoted by HomeGrid Forum for high-speed (up to 1 Gbit/s) local area networks over existing home wiring (coaxial cables, power lines and phone lines). G.hn defines an Application Protocol Convergence (APC) layer that accepts Ethernet frames and encapsulates them into G.hn MSDUs. Other networking standards do not use the Ethernet frame format but can still be connected to Ethernet using MAC-based bridging. *802.11—Standards for wireless local area networks (LANs), sold with brand name Wi-Fi *802.16—Standards for wireless metropolitan area networks (MANs), sold with brand name WiMAX Other special-purpose physical layers include Avionics Full-Duplex Switched Ethernet and TTEthernet — Time-Triggered Ethernet for embedded systems. ==ReferencesExternal links== *Get IEEE 802.3 *IEEE 802.3 *How to make an Ethernet cable Category:Physical layer protocols Physical Layer es:Capa física de Ethernet ","title":"Ethernet physical layer"},{"id":"5559179","text":"\\"Monster\\" is the third UK single by Cardiff-based Welsh band The Automatic, taken from their debut album Not Accepted Anywhere. The track was released on 5 June 2006 in the UK and subsequently reached No. 4 on the UK Singles Chart. It was released in the United States under the alias of The Automatic Automatic on 14 May 2007. It is The Automatic's highest charting single to date in the United Kingdom. ==Composition== The track's music was composed by James Frost and Robin Hawkins, with the original incarnation featuring a different chorus, both musically and lyrically. However the band decided first to change the music before deciding to rewrite the chorus's lyrics. The chorus was planned to have a fairytale-esque theme to it, with keyboardist and vocalist Alex Pennie penning the idea which would become the track's famous lyric \\"What's that coming over the hill? Is it a monster? Is it a monster?\\". Originally however, the lyric was used just to fill the chorus until a more suitable lyric was found, but over time the lyric stuck and so was eventually used when the band recorded a demo of it in 2005.The Automatic in session on BBC Radio Wales, 10 December 2009, Alan Thompson - The Evening Show Automatic - Run And Hide BBC, The Evening Show Many of the lyrics used in \\"Monster\\" are metaphors for drug and drink intoxication; \\"brain fried tonight through misuse\\" and \\"without these pills you're let loose\\", with the chorus 'monster' lyric being a metaphor for the monster that comes out when people are intoxicated.The Automatic Rob Hawkins, James Frost, Alex Pennie, Iwan Griffiths music-news.com, 20 July 2006 The original demo of \\"Monster\\" featured more prominent synthesizers, with some different vocals, including more gang vocals during the chorus and distorted backing vocals during the verses and bridge. The guitar, bass and drums however stayed relatively the same when in late 2005 they rerecorded the track for their album Not Accepted Anywhere. With the line-up change in 2007, seeing Paul Mullen join, \\"Monster\\" was reworked, with Paul providing a second guitar part, with almost all synthesizer parts removed. In addition, a new section was added to the bridge of \\"Monster\\", featuring a riff from Paul Mullen's band Yourcodenameis:milo track \\"All Roads to Fault\\". ==Release== A demo of the track was released in early 2005. The single release of \\"Monster\\" was announced in April 2006; the single would precede the band's debut album, which was also announced Not Accepted Anywhere. The single was released on 5 June 2006 on vinyl, CD and through digital download, the various single formats featured various remixes of \\"Monster\\" and the B-side from recording Not Accepted Anywhere \\"Night Drive\\" which has rarely been performed live. The release of Monster was celebrated by a performance in Cardiff HMV on 5 June, with a series of HMV and Fopp instore performances over the following days. The American release of Monster came almost a year later on 14 May 2007; it was the band's only American single to- date, with their at the time American distributor Columbia Records not picking the band up in 2008 with Steve McQueen due to the record agreement between the band's main at-the-time label B-Unique Records, Polydor Records and subsequently Columbia Records.

Half of the band in 2005 believed that Not Accepted Anywhere track \\"Rats\\" would end up being a bigger hit than \\"Monster\\". > \\"We wrote a song, it did really well, I don't really see what there is to be > upset about. You get labelled \\"one hit wonders\\", but that's more hits than > most people have. And it's not like we've disappeared without a trace.

We wouldn't have been in a position to fly to LA to make a record if > it wasn't for 'Monster'.\\" > > — Robin Hawkins The track has received fairly mixed reviews, Dom Gourlay of Contact Music slated the pop track calling it \\"daft, irresponsible and unforgettably irritating\\" whilst Stephen Ackroyd of Click Music rated the track music higher, giving it 4/5. Drowned in Sound's Rachel Cawley gave the track 0 out of 10, attacking fans of the track saying; \\"If it was you who requested this to be played on the radio, you have my sympathy. Are you so stupefied that you find this ditchwater enthralling?\\" MusicOHM's Ryan Thomas reacted to the track far more positively, saying \\"Monster is an electrifying 3 minutes and 44 seconds of pop music at its finest\\" NME also praised the track \\"it's the catchiest indie hit of the summer, boasting a hook that could disembowel a whale\\" Gigwise.com however was not as positive, referring to previous singles \\"Recover\\" and \\"Raoul\\" saying \\"The Automatic's releases are getting progressively worse each time. Are they running out of good songs?\\" ==Chart performance== The track spent 16 weeks on the UK Singles Chart originally, with its highest charting position at No. 4. In 2007, when digital tracks began being counted in the UK Singles Chart, Monster re-entered the singles chart once more, at No. 34. With the self-release of third album Tear the Signs Down in 2010, the band revealed that Monster's success brought in a constant revenue to the band. ==Music video== The music video was produced and directed by Dominic Thompson-TalbotThe Automatic \\"Monster\\" Directed by Dom Thompson-Talbot Dominic Thompson-Talbot, vimeo, 15 April 2009 of production company Up the Resolution, who would go on to work with the band on their next singles \\"Raoul\\" and \\"Recover\\". The shoot took place in Black Park, London in 2006 and features Hadleigh Lomasney as 'big-foot'. The video features the band playing monster hunters in false beards and hiking gear. They travel in an old van draped with camouflage and newspaper articles that refer to monsters, UFOs and Nessie, and James Frost plays his guitar solo standing on top of the van. The characters encounter Nessie and Big Foot but remain oblivious to their finds; when they return to the van they are surrounded by monsters who are destroyed by a UFO, which then zaps the band as they exit the van. ==Track listingCharts== Weekly charts center\\" !Chart (2006) !Peak position - - !scope=\\"row\\"Europe (Eurochart Hot 100) 13 - - - - } Year-end charts {class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text- align:center\\" !Chart (2006) !Position - !scope=\\"row\\"UK Singles (Official Charts Company) 21 } ==CertificationsReferencesExternal links== * Behind the scenes video shoot photos by Peter Hill * Listen To Monster At Last.fm Category:2006 singles Category:2006 songs Category:The Automatic songs Category:Loch Ness Monster Category:Polydor Records singles Category:Songs about alcohol Category:Songs about drugs Category:Songs written by Alex Pennie Category:Songs written by Iwan Griffiths Category:Songs written by James Frost Category:Songs written by Robin Hawkins ","title":"Monster (The Automatic song)"},{"id":"5559184","text":"Bukit Raja Bukit Raja is a mukim in Petaling District, Selangor, Malaysia.http://apps.water.gov.my/jpskomuniti/dokumen/Contoh%20Laporan%20Profil%20Daerah%20(LPD).pdf It was an oil palm plantation owned by Sime Derby Plantations.

These anthropogenic plants, for the most part, have commercial value in horticulture, agriculture or forestry. Because cultigens are defined by their mode of origin and not by where they are growing, plants meeting this definition remain cultigens whether they are naturalised in the wild, deliberately planted in the wild, or growing in cultivation. Cultigens arise in the following ways: * selections of variants from the wild or cultivation including vegetative sports (aberrant growth that can be reproduced reliably in cultivation) * plants that are the result of plant breeding and selection programs * genetically modified plants (plants modified by the deliberate implantation of genetic material) * graft-chimaeras (plants grafted to produce mixed tissue, the graft material possibly from wild plants, special selections, or hybrids). ==Naming== Cultigens may be named in any of a number of ways. The traditional method of scientific naming is under the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants, and many of the most important cultigens, like maize (Zea mays) and banana (Musa acuminata), are so named. Although it is perfectly in order to give a cultigen a botanical name, in any rank desired, now or at any other time, Art. 28 \\"Note 3. Nothing precludes the use, for cultivated plants, of names published in accordance with the requirements of this Code.\\" these days it is more common for cultigens to be given names in accordance with the principles, rules and recommendations laid down in the International Code of Nomenclature for Cultivated Plants (ICNCP) which provides for the names of cultigens in three classification categories, the cultivar, the Group (formerly cultivar-group), and the grex. From that viewpoint it may be said that there is a separate discipline of cultivated plant taxonomy, which forms one of the ways to look at cultigens. The ICNCP does not recognize the use of trade designations and other marketing devices as scientifically acceptable names, but does provide advice on how they should be presented. Article 10 and Appendix 10. Not all cultigens have been given names according to the Cultivated Plant Code. Apart from ancient cultigens like those mentioned above there may be occasional anthropogenic plants such as those that are the result of breeding, selection, and tissue grafting that are of no commercial value and have therefore not been given names according to the ICNCP. == Formal definition == A cultigen is a plant whose origin or selection is primarily due to intentional human activity. == The wild/cultivated distinction == Interest in the distinction between wild and cultivated plants dates back to antiquity. Botanical historian Alan Morton notes that wild and cultivated plants (cultigens) were of intense interest to the ancient Greek botanists (partly for religious reasons) and that the distinction was discussed in some detail by Theophrastus (370–285 BCE) the \\"Father of Botany\\". Theophrastus was a pupil of both Plato and Aristotle and succeeded the latter as head of the Peripatetic School of Philosophy at the Lyceum in Athens. Theophrastus accepted the view that it was human action, not divine intervention, that produced cultivated plants (cultigens) from wild plants and he also \\"had an inkling of the limits of culturally induced (phenotypic) changes and of the importance of genetic constitution\\" (Historia Plantarum III, 2,2 and Causa Plantarum I, 9,3). He also noted that cultivated varieties of fruit trees would degenerate if cultivated from seed.Morton, A.G. 1981. History of Botanical Science. London: Academic Press. . == Origin of term == Liberty Hyde Bailey 1858–1954, who coined the word cultigen in 1918 The word cultigen was coined in 1918Bailey, L.H. 1918. The indigen and cultigen. Science ser. 2, 47:306-308 by Liberty Hyde Bailey (1858–1954) an American horticulturist, botanist and cofounder of the American Society for Horticultural Science. He was aware of the need for special categories for those cultivated plants that had arisen by intentional human activity and which would not fit neatly into the Linnaean hierarchical classification of ranks used by the International Rules of Botanical Nomenclature (which later became the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants). In his 1918 paper Bailey noted that for anyone preparing a descriptive account of the cultivated plants of a country (he was at that time preparing such an account for North America) it would be clear that there are two gentes or kinds (Latin singular, gens; plural, gentes) of plants. Firstly, those that are of known origin or nativity \\"of known habitat\\". These he referred to as indigens. The other kind was: > \\" ... a domesticated group of which the origin may be unknown or indefinite, > which has such characters as to separate it from known indigens, and which > is probably not represented by any type specimen or exact description, > having therefore no clear taxonomic beginning.\\" He called this second kind of plant a cultigen, the word derived from the conflation of the Latin cultus – cultivated, and gens – kind. In 1923Bailey, L.H. 1923. Various cultigens, and transfers in nomenclature. Gentes Herb. 1:113--136 Bailey extended his original discussion emphasising that he was dealing with plants at the rank of species and he referred to indigens as: > \\"those that are discovered in the wild\\" and cultigens as plants that: > \\"arise in some way under the hand of man\\" He then defined a cultigen as: > \\"a species, or its equivalent, that has appeared under domestication\\" == Bailey's definitions == Bailey soon altered his 1923 definition of cultigen when, in 1924, he gave a new definition in the Glossary of his Manual of Cultivated PlantsBailey, L.H. 1924. Manual of cultivated plants. Macmillan, New York as: > \\" Plant or group known only in cultivation; presumably originating under > domestication; contrast with indigen \\" This, in essence, is the definition given at the head of this piece. This definition of the cultigen permits the recognition of cultivars, unlike the 1923 definition which restricts the idea of the cultigen to plants at the rank of species. In later publications of the Liberty Hyde Bailey Hortorium, Cornell, the idea of the cultigen having the rank of species returned (e.g. Hortus Second in 1941 and Hortus Third in 1976):Bailey, L.H. 1941. Hortus second : a concise dictionary of gardening, general horticulture and cultivated plants in North America. The Macmillan Company, New York.Bailey, L.H. 1976. Hortus third : a concise dictionary of plants cultivated in the United States and Canada. Macmillan Collier Macmillan, New York. both of these publications indicate that the terms cultigen and cultivar are not synonymous and that cultigens exist at the rank of species only. > \\"A cultigen is a plant or group of apparent specific rank, known only in > cultivation, with no determined nativity, presumably having originated, in > the form in which we know it, under domestication. Compare indigen. Examples > are Cucurbita maxima, Phaseolus vulgaris, Zea mays \\". Recent usage in horticulture has, however, maintained a distinction between cultigen and cultivar while nevertheless allowing the inclusion of cultivars within the definition (see \\"Usage in horticulture\\" below). == Cultivars == Cultigen and cultivar may be confused with one another. Cultigen is a general- purpose term encompassing not only plants with cultivar names but others as well (see introductory text above), while cultivar is a formal classification category (in the ICNCP). Although in his 1923 paper Bailey used only the rank of species for the cultigen, it was clear to him that many domesticated plants were more like botanical varieties than species and so he established a new classification category for these, the cultivar. Bailey was never explicit about the etymology of the word cultivar and it has been suggested that it is a contraction of the words \\"cultigen\\" or \\"cultivated\\" and \\"variety\\".Trehane, P. 2004. 50 years of the International Code of Nomenclature for Cultivated Plants. Acta Horticulturae 634: 17-27. He defined cultivar in his 1923 paper as: > ... \\"a race subordinate to species, that has originated and persisted under > cultivation; it is not necessarily, however, referable to a recognised > botanical species. It is essentially the equivalent of the botanical variety > except in respect to its origin\\". This definition and understanding of cultivar has changed over time (see current definition in cultivar). == Usage ==  Usage in botany  In botanical literature the word cultigen is generally used to denote a plant which, like the bread wheat (Triticum aestivum) is of unknown origin, but presumed to be an ancient human selection. Plants like bread wheat have been given binomials according to the Botanical Code and therefore have names with the same form as those of plant species that occur naturally in the wild, but it is not necessary for a cultigen to have a species name, or to have the biological characteristics that distinguish a species. Cultigens can have names at any of various other ranks, including cultivar names, names in the classification categories of grex and group, variety names, forma names, or they may be plants that have been altered by humans (including genetically modified plants) but which have not been given formal names.  Usage in horticulture  The year 1953 was an important one for cultivated plant taxonomy because this was the date of publication of the first International Code of Nomenclature for Cultivated Plants in which Bailey's term cultivar was introduced. It was also the year that the eponymous journal commemorating the work of Bailey (who died in 1954), Baileya, was published. In the first volume of Baileya taxonomist and colleague of Bailey, George Lawrence, wrote a short article clarifying the distinction between the new term cultivar and the variety. In the same article he also tried to clarify the critical term taxon which had been introduced by German biologist Meyer in the 1920s but had only just been introduced and accepted in botanical circles. This brief article by Lawrence is useful for its insight into the understanding of the meaning of the word cultigen at this time. He opens the article: > In 1918, L.H. Bailey distinguished those plants originating in cultivation > from the native plants by designating the former as cultigens and the latter > as indigens (indigenous or native to the region). At the same time he > proposed the term cultivar to distinguish varieties originating in > cultivation from botanical varieties known first in the wild.Lawrence, > George H. M. 1953. \\"Cultivar, Distinguished from Variety.\\" Baileya 1: 19–20. In horticulture the definition and use of the terms cultigen and cultivar has varied. One example is the definition given in the Botanical Glossary of The New Royal Horticultural Society Dictionary of GardeningHuxley, A., Griffiths, M., and Levy, M. (eds.) 1992. The New Royal Horticultural Society Dictionary of Gardening. Macmillan, London which defines cultigen as: > \\" A plant found only in cultivation or in the wild having escaped from > cultivation; included here are many hybrids and cultivars, \\"... The use of cultigen in this sense is essentially the same as the definition of the cultigen published by Bailey in 1924. The Cultivated Plant Code, however, states that cultigens are \\"maintained as recognisable entities solely by continued propagation\\", and thus would not include plants that have evolved subsequent to escape from cultivation.  Recommended usage  Wider use of the term cultigen as defined here has been proposed for the following reasons: * supports current usage in horticulture * assists clarity in non-technical discussions about \\"wild\\" and \\"cultivated\\" plants (for example, cultivated plants as commonly understood (plants in cultivation) are not the same as the \\"cultivated plants\\" of the Cultivated Plant Code, and the distinction between \\"wild\\" and \\"cultivated\\" habitats is becoming progressively blurred) * has the potential to simplify the language and definitions used in the Articles and Recommendations of the Cultivated Plant Code * gives greater precision and clarity to the definition of the respective scope, terminology and concepts of the Botanical Code and the Cultivated Plant Code * avoids the potential for confusion within the Cultivated Plant Code over its scope, that is, whether it is concerned with: ** where plants are growing (in the wild or in cultivation) ** how they originated (whether they are the result of intentional human activity or not) ** whether it simply provides a mechanism for regulating the names of those cultigens requiring special classification categories that are not part of the Linnaean hierarchy of the Botanical Code i.e. cultivar and Group namesSpencer, R.D. 1999. Cultivated plants and the codes of nomenclature – towards the resolution of a demarcation dispute. pp.171—181 in: S. Andrews, A.C. Leslie and C. Alexander (eds). Taxonomy of Cultivated Plants: Third Symposium. Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew. == Critique of definition == Potential misunderstandings and questions arising from the definition of cultigen given here have been discussed in the literature and are summarised below. * Natural and artificial selection :The selection process is termed \\"artificial\\" when human preferences or influences have a significant effect on the evolution of a particular population or species (see artificial selection). Note: artificial selection is a part of the overall selection process – it does not imply that humans are not part of nature, it is simply useful sometimes to distinguish when there has been human influence on selection (as with cultigens). * What exactly does altered mean? :There are cases that do not seem to comply with the definition. For example, we can presume that the entire global flora is changing as a result of human-induced climate change. Does this mean that all plants are cultigens? :In cases like this the definition refers to \\"deliberate\\" selection and this would be of particular plant characteristics that are not exhibited by a plant's wild counterparts (but see Selections from the wild). * What exactly does deliberately selected mean? :From the moment a plant is taken from the wild it is subject to human selection pressure – from the selection of the original propagation material to the purchase of the plant in a nursery. Surely this form of selection is not deliberate? Again, the early human selection of crops 7,000-10,000 years ago is thought to have occurred quite unintentionally. Variants useful to horticulture often arise spontaneously, they are not deliberate products. Are these cases of unintentional, accidental, or unconscious selection? :There certainly appear to be cases where origin or selection of a plant is not \\"deliberate\\". However, the long term propagation of plants that have some utility, usually economic or ornamental, can hardly be regarded as unintentional and these plants will, almost without exception, have characteristic(s) that distinguish them from their wild counterparts. * What about plants selected from the wild? :Plants like Quercus robur, Pedunculate or English Oak, Liquidambar styraciflua, Sweetgum and Eucalyptus globulus, Blue Gum grown in parks and gardens are essentially the same as their wild counterparts and are therefore not cultigens. However, occasionally within natural plant variation there occur characters that are of value to horticulture but of little interest to botany. For example a plant might have flowers of several different colours but these may not have been given formal botanical names. It is customary in horticulture to introduce such variants to commerce and to give them cultivar names. Technically these plants have not been deliberately altered in any way from plants growing (or once growing) in the wild but as they are deliberately selected and named it seems permissible to refer to them as cultigens. These occurrences are very few. The definition could be (clumsily) extended by mentioning that selection can be for \\"desirable variation that is not recognised in botanical nomenclature\\". * What about gene flow between populations? :Occasionally cultigens escape from cultivation into the wild where they breed with indigenous plants. Selections may be made from the progeny in the wild and brought back into cultivation where they are used for breeding and the results of the breeding again escape into the wild to breed with indigenous plants. Lantana has behaved much like this. The genetic material of a cultigen may become part of the gene pool of a population where, over time, it may be largely or completely swamped. In cases like this what plants are to be called cultigens? :Whether a plant is a cultigen or not does not depend on where it is growing. If it complies with the definition then it is a cultigen. Cases like this have always been difficult for botanical nomenclature. Unnamed progeny in the wild might be given a name like Lantana aff. camara (aff. = having affinities with) or may remain unnamed. Its cultigenic origin may or may not be recognised by the allocation of a cultivar name. * Plants of unknown origin :Occasionally plants will occur whose origin is unknown. Plants growing in cultivation that are unknown in the wild may be determined as cultigenic as a result of scientific investigation, but may remain a mystery. * Difficult cases :It may happen that a hybrid cross that has occurred in nature is also performed deliberately in cultivation and that the progeny appear identical. How do we know which plants are cultigens? :If the cross in cultivation is followed by deliberate selection and naming then this will indicate a cultigen. However in a case like this it may not be possible to tell. == See also == * Domestication of plants * Human impact on the environment * Indigen * Liberty Hyde Bailey * Artificial selection * Binomial nomenclature * Cultivar * Cultivated plant taxonomy == References ==  Footnotes  == Further reading == * * == External links == * Proposal of the term cultigen at the V International Symposium on the Taxonomy of Cultivated Plants 2008 * International Society for Horticultural Science (includes links to the Botanical Code, Cultivated Plant Code and web sites of International Cultivar Registration Authorities).

The character is depicted as a member of the Eternals, a race of superhumans in the Marvel Universe. He first appeared in the 1976–78 comic book series The Eternals, where the name was spelled Makarri. He was also a member of the First Line and Monster Hunters. Lauren Ridloff will play a female deaf version of Makkari in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, debuting in Eternals (2021). ==Publication history== Originally, Makkari was a character in Jack Kirby's The Eternals. Mark Gruenwald later reintroduced Makkari as a long-running supporting character in the Quasar series. Hurricane reappears as a member of the Monster Hunters in Marvel Universe #4 (September 1998),Marvel Universe #4 (September 1998) in a story set in the 1950s. By the end of this three-issue story, it turns out the monsters they are hunting are actually Deviants and Hurricane is revealed to be Makkari.Marvel Universe #7 (December 1998) Marvel Comics continuity was later retconned so that the character presented as the mythological god Mercury, introduced as a Marvel protagonist in Red Raven Comics #1 (August 1940), was, in fact, Makkari. Mercury was only seen in that one story, in which he worked to thwart the machinations of Pluto. Makkari is featured as one of the main character in the Marvel limited series Eternals, written by Neil Gaiman and penciled by artist John Romita Jr. ==Fictional character biography== Makkari is the son of Verona and Mara, born in Olympia, capital city of the Eternals of Earth. He is a member of the Eternals' Technologist's Guild and is skilled at designing and building high-speed vehicles. Makkari has involved himself in Earth's affairs more often than most Eternals. Under the name Thoth, he taught writing to the Egyptians.Marvel Mystery Handbook 70th Anniversary Special #1 He was taught philosophy by Plato.Quasar #28 He rescued Sersi from Nero's Fire. He spent some time as the charioteer of Darius I of Persia. He witnessed the Trojan War, the reign of Vlad the Impaler, and the Alamo. In the 1940s, he worked on Earth, per Zuras' request, under the aliases \\"Hurricane\\" and \\"Mercury\\" (an example of retcon, these Golden Age characters were not originally supposed to be related), and fought Warlord Kro and Deviant Mutates alongside the Monster Hunters, a team he formed using his identity as National Security Agent Jake Curtiss. Later on, he taught Elvis Presley a few guitar tricks. Following the disbanding of the Monster Hunters, Makkari was convinced by Pixie to join the First Line as \\"Major Mercury\\".Between Marvel: The Lost Generation #4 and #5 He and First Line fought against the original Skrull invasion of Earth, and, along with Yeti and Pixie, was one of the few members of First Line to survive the conflict.Marvel: The Lost Generation #12 Makkari accompanied Thena to New York City to help rescue Sersi and repulse the Deviant invasion. He was with the Eternals who introduced themselves to the students at City College during the Fourth Host of the Celestials.Eternals Vol. 1 #5-6 He then returned to Olympia with Ikaris and Margo Damian, where he encountered Sprite.Eternals Vol. 1 #9 He also participated in the Uni-Mind ritual.Eternals Vol. 1 #11-13 Alongside Ikaris and Sersi, he battled the Hulk robot.Eternals Vol. 1 #14-15 Makkari then battled Ikaris, who was under the mental influence of Dromedan.Eternals Vol. 1 #16 Makkari later battled Hermes of Olympus.Thor #291 He battled Maelstrom alongside the Avengers. Makkari elected to remain while the majority of Eternals departed Earth.Avengers #247-248 Makkari accompanied Ikaris on his mission to assemble the Eternals to wage war against the Deviants.Eternals Vol. 2 #3-4 Makkari then encountered Lord Ghaur.Eternals Vol. 2 #7 Makkari accompanied the other Eternals to Lemuria to battle the Deviants.Eternals Vol. 2 #10 Makkari battled Ghaur alongside the Eternals, Thor, and the West Coast Avengers, and participated in the defeat of Ghaur.Eternals Vol. 2 #12 Some time later, alongside the Eternals, Makkari fought the Super-Skrull, and encountered the Silver Surfer.Silver Surfer Annual #1 Makkari was later rescued by Quasar when he began running rampant, literally.Quasar #11 He revealed that he had traded his other Eternal abilities for greater speed and endurance. He became friends with Quasar when he enlisted Quasar to go to Lemuria to help him save Master Elo, who was tutoring Makkari in how to channel his cosmic energy into more speed.Quasar #12 He then accompanied Quasar to the Stranger's laboratory world. There, he encountered the Star- Dancer, and battled Trikon, the Whizzer, and Gorr.Quasar #17 Makkari later worked in Quasar's office under the alias \\"Mike Khary.\\" He participated in a marathon to the Moon sponsored by the Runner, one of the Elders of the Universe, and nearly won; he bested Quicksilver, Captain Marvel, Whizzer, Speed Demon, Black Racer, and Super Sabre, only to lose the race in the last moments by an amnesiac, dimensions-spanning human being. Makkari then became Quasar's roommate.Quasar #19 He was killed when his heart was stopped by Maelstrom,Quasar #21 but returned to life,Quasar #25 as part of an agreement struck between Eternity, Death, Infinity and Oblivion. Maelstrom later attempted to seize more power by draining the kinetic energy from Makkari, but Maelstrom was ultimately defeated by the other Eternals. However, he soon found he had become so fast that he could no longer move in synch with the rest of the universe.Quasar #58 In the 2006 Eternals limited series, the Eternals are the victims of memory and reality manipulation by Sprite, and have thus forgotten their true identities. Makkari believes himself to be a medicine student named Mark Curry, and is the first Eternal shown in the series. He meets Ikaris, and causes his capture by the Deviants. By issues #2 and #3, he finally begins to experience his powers of super-speed, and uses it to stop terrorists attacking a party. However, after telling him what has happened Sprite tricks Curry into opening a passageway to the long-dormant Celestial underneath San Francisco, and in doing so incapacitates Curry. During this time the Dreaming Celestial and Makkari began to talk in his dreams, firstly in the form of Sersi, and told him that it personally made him. By the end of the series he has become the Dreaming Celestial's prophet. Later when the Celestials' Final Host arrived on Earth, Makari along with all the Eternals killed themselves after realizing the true purpose for which they were created.Avengers (vol. 8) #4 ==Powers and abilities== Makkari is a member of the race of superhumans known as Eternals. He possesses superhuman strength, speed, and reflexes. He can create cyclones by running in circles, and can run up walls and across water. Makkari's body eventually accumulates fatigue poisons and is susceptible to injury. Although in most of his appearances Makkari has the typical powers of an Eternal, his obsession with speed, starting in the Quasar series, causes him to focus most of his body's Cosmic Energy into enhancing his running speed. As a result, he lost his ability to fly and many of his other powers have been weakened in the process. Makkari possesses none of the psionic powers of the average Eternal (levitation, ocular force projection, and molecular rearrangement), having purposefully readapted all his specialized cell enclaves to speed and running- related attributes. At present, he can run at near light speed for extended periods, but his physical strength (while still far greater than human) has been reduced by half, and he seemingly cannot project energy or manipulate matter. Makkari sometimes wears a protective crash helmet, though he does not truly need it. He wears synthetic stretch fabric, specially treated to resist the rigors of high velocity movement. Makkari has great mechanical aptitude, and the ability to pilot most land and air vehicles. He has moderate experience at hand-to-hand combat; his fighting style incorporates his superhuman speed. He has finished the standard Eternal higher education, and underwent special tutoring in the applications of speed. ==In other media== Television * Makkari appears in Marvel Knights: Eternals, voiced by Sebastian Spence.

Finally, Rajkumar on insisting Gowda that money not be wasted, the filming resumed in black-and-white. The story Kasturi Nivasam written by G. Balasubramanium had been bought by film producer Noor for 25,000 wanting to make a film in Tamil with Sivaji Ganesan However, Ganesan was reluctant after hearing the story, considering that the film had a tragic ending with the protagonist dying. In the early part of 1971, Kannada script writer Chi. Udayashankar and Rajkumar’s younger brother S.P. Varadaraj chanced upon the project. Eventually, they coaxed B. Dorai Raj and S.K. Bhagavan, to listen to the story. Upon hearing the story, Dorai-Bhagavan, were interested in making the film with Rajkumar under their banner Anupam Movies. But they were not sure if Rajkumar would accept the role. Rajkumar was then convinced by his brother Varadappa, following which the rights were brought from Noor by director Dorai Raj and S. K. Bhagavan for 38,000. Filming done in Mysore and Kanteerava Studios in Bangalore, was completed in 19 and a half days, having spent 3.75 lakh. The dove bird used in the film was bought for 500 from outside the erstwhile Mysore State. Rajkumar received a remuneration of 15,000. Learning of film’s success Shivaji Productions purchased the rights of the film for 2 lakh. Shivaji Ganeshan was all praise for Rajkumar’s performance. The Tamil version of Kasturi Nivasa, directed by K. Shankar hit the screen as Avandhan Manithan (1975). == Soundtrack == The music for the film and soundtracks were composed by G. K. Venkatesh. The album consists of six tracks, sung by P. Susheela, P. B. Sreenivas, G.K. Venkatesh and L. R. Eswari. The songs \\"Aadisidaata\\" and \\"Aadisi Nodu Beelisi Nodu\\" were written by Chi. Udaya Shankar, who also wrote the film's screenplay. On the final day of the re-recording, while scoring the background music for the climax, L. Vaidyanathan, assistant to music director G.K. Venkatesh, felt free verse would enhance the mood and add additional depth to the situation. Immediately lyricist Chi. Udayashankar was called and made to listen to the tune on violin, he then wrote the lyrics for song Aadisidaata which G.K. Venkatesh himself sang. The song Nee Bandu Nintaaga was loosely inspired by the song Yeh Dil Diwana Hai from the 1970 Hindi movie Ishq Par Zor Nahin.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ap9UZoeUHW8 {  !No. !Title !Lyrics !Singers !Picturization !Length - 01 \\"Nee Bandu Nintaga\\" R.

However, the movie picked up soon and went on to complete 175 days at several centres across Karnataka with a 100 week run at 16 centres in Mysore. The movie is considered to be a landmark both in the career of Dr Rajkumar and in the Kannada cinema. Today the movie is included in the list of best Kannada movies of all time and in the list of best Rajkumar movies with Bangarada Manushya, Sampathige Saval, Babruvahana and Mayura being the other recurring names.http://www.sandalwoodking.rocks/threads/100days-movies-of-kannada-stars- in-main-theatre.4867/page-6https://itsmeadarsh.wordpress.com/tag/kasturi- nivasa/ == Legacy == The movie is considered to be a gem in Kannada film industry. The role of Ravi Varma, the protagonist played by Rajkumar is a character who upholds the values of life even it means his destruction; a person who is keen on retaining his character's purity and those morals he has cherished. The character became an inspiration for the protagonist, Siddhartha of the 2017 blockbuster Raajakumara which had Dr Rajkumar's own son Puneeth Rajkumar in the lead. \\"Every character played by Dr Rajkumar........ Some roles like that of Rajeeva's character in Bangarada Manushya and the one in Kasturi Nivasa, have attained greatness due to this. They are considered to be the topmost films in Dr Rajkumar's career. This is also one of the reasons why recently the released-film Raajakumara featuring Puneeth Rajkumar, has great similarities of those selfless acts of Annavru in Kasturi Nivasa and this instantly connected with the audience\\", said film historian Srinivas. == Colourisation == A comparison between the original (above) and colourised versions Kasturi Nivasa was Rajkumar's second film to be colourised and then theatrically released, after Satya Harishchandra (1965), a colourised version of which was released in 2008. The project to colourise Kasturi Nivasa was taken up by its producer K. C. N. Gowda. With parts of the film's negatives damaged, the first step in colourisation involved procuring the archival print from the Karnataka film archives. Bits of the negatives were then procured from other sources and spliced together to restore the original quality of the film (in black-and-white). The colourisation work was carried out by 60 personnel for a period of 20 months, who coloured each of the 215,000 frames of the original film. The music of the film was also recreated. The audio of the film stored digitally was converted to 5.1 surround sound. With the work 70 percent completed, Gowda died in October 2012. Following his death, his son K. C. N. Mohan took over the project. Speaking of colourising the dresses in film's frames, he said, \\"We had to take into consideration the costumes of the 1970s. We used a software which gave us the nearest-matching colour.\\" The black-and-white film was first saved in digital format before removing the scratches, dots and rainy lines from it. Based on the grey scales, colours were then added using a digital enhancement technique for the first time for an Indian film. The colourised film has a frame rate of 24 per second. The project was completed at a cost of . The colourised film released on 7 November 2014, in over 100 prints in Karnataka. Upon the theatrical re- release, the film opened to a good response from the audience. It opened to packed audiences in the initial weeks of its release, performing well in both single screens and multiplexes. Competing against other films that released during the time of its release, the film performed well and trade analysts speculated a 2 crore revenue in its first week of re-release. Film critic Shyam Prasad S. of Bangalore Mirror remarked that the coloured version \\"colouring retains the charm of the old world films.\\" He added, \\"The colouring was not a restoration work. It has made the classic even better.\\" Following a good response at the domestic box-office, reports in late November 2014 the film was screened in six cities in the United States. == References  External links == * Category:1970s Kannada-language films Category:Indian films Category:1971 films Category:1971 drama films Category:Indian drama films Category:Indian black-and-white films Category:Kannada films remade in other languages Category:Kannada film scores by G.

Beagle and published in 1968, by Viking Press in the U.S. and The Bodley Head in the U.K. It follows the tale of a unicorn, who believes she is the last of her kind in the world and undertakes a quest to discover what has happened to the others. It has sold more than five million copies worldwide since its original publication, and has been translated into at least twenty languages (prior to the 2007 edition). In 1987, Locus ranked The Last Unicorn number five among the 33 \\"All-Time Best Fantasy Novels\\", based on a poll of subscribers. • See also \\"1987 Locus Poll Award\\". ISFDB. Retrieved 2012-04-25. The 1998 rendition of the poll ranked The Last Unicorn number 18. The Locus Online website links multiple pages providing the results of several polls and a little other information. ==Plot== The story begins with a group of human hunters passing through a forest in search of game. After days of coming up empty-handed, they begin to believe they are passing through a Unicorn's forest, where animals are kept safe by a magical aura. They resign themselves to hunting somewhere else; but, before they leave, one of the hunters calls out a warning to the Unicorn that she may be the last of her kind. This revelation disturbs the Unicorn, and though she initially dismisses it, eventually doubt and worry drive her to leave her forest. She travels through the land and discovers that humans no longer even recognize her; instead they see a pretty white mare. She encounters a talking butterfly who speaks in riddles and songs and initially dodges her questions about the other unicorns. Eventually, the butterfly issues a warning that her kind have been herded to a far away land by a creature known as the Red Bull. She continues to search for other unicorns. During her journey, she is taken captive by a traveling carnival led by witch Mommy Fortuna, who uses magical spells to create the illusion that regular animals are in fact creatures of myth and legend. The Unicorn finds herself the only true legendary creature among the group, save for the harpy, Celaeno. Schmendrick, a magician traveling with the carnival, sees the Unicorn for what she is, and he frees her in the middle of the night. The Unicorn frees the other creatures including Celaeno, who kills Mommy Fortuna and Rukh, her hunchbacked assistant. The Unicorn and Schmendrick continue traveling in an attempt to reach the castle of King Haggard, where the Red Bull resides. When Schmendrick is captured by bandits, the Unicorn comes to his rescue and attracts the attention of Molly Grue, the bandit leader's wife. Together, the three continue their journey and arrive at Hagsgate, a town under Haggard's rule and the first one he had conquered when he claimed his kingdom. A resident of Hagsgate named Drinn informs them of a curse that stated that their town would continue to share in Haggard's fortune until such a time that someone from Hagsgate would bring Haggard's castle down. Drinn goes on to claim that he discovered a baby boy in the town's marketplace one night in winter. He knew that the child was the one the prophecy spoke of, but he left the baby where he found it, not wanting the prophecy to come true. King Haggard found the baby later that evening and adopted it. Molly, Schmendrick and the Unicorn leave Hagsgate and continue toward Haggard's castle, but on their way they are attacked by the Red Bull. The Unicorn runs, but is unable to escape the bull. In an effort to aid her, Schmendrick unwittingly turns the Unicorn into a human woman. Confused by the change, the Red Bull gives up the pursuit and disappears. The change has disastrous consequences on the Unicorn, who suffers tremendous shock at the sudden feeling of mortality in her human body. Schmendrick tells the unicorn that he is immortal and that he cannot make real magic unless he is mortal, and encourages her to continue her quest. The three continue to Haggard's castle, where Schmendrick introduces the Unicorn as \\"Lady Amalthea\\" to throw off Haggard's suspicions. They manage to convince Haggard to allow them to serve him in his court, with the hopes of gathering clues as to the location of the other unicorns. During their stay, Amalthea is romanced by Haggard's adopted son, Prince Lír. Haggard eventually reveals to Amalthea that the unicorns are trapped in the sea for his own benefit, because the unicorns are the only things that make him happy. He then openly accuses Amalthea of coming to his kingdom to save the unicorns and says that he knows who she really is, but Amalthea has seemingly forgotten about her true nature and her desire to save the other unicorns. Following clues given to them by a cat, Molly, Schmendrick, and Amalthea find the entrance to the Red Bull's lair. Haggard and his men-at-arms attempt to stop them, but they manage to enter the bull's lair and are joined by Lír. When the Red Bull attacks them, Schmendrick changes Amalthea back to her original form. At this moment, Schmendrick joyfully becomes mortal. In an effort to save the Unicorn, Lír jumps into the bull's path and is trampled. Fueled by anger and sorrow, the Unicorn drives the bull into the sea. The other unicorns are freed, and they run back to their homes, with Haggard's castle falling in their wake. As the castle falls, its wreckage dissolves into mist before it even hits the ground, and nothing remains to indicate that a castle had ever been there. The Unicorn revives Lír with the healing touch of her horn. Now king after Haggard's death, he attempts to follow the Unicorn despite Schmendrick advising against it. As they pass through the now-ruined town of Hagsgate, they learn that Drinn is actually Lír's father, and that he had abandoned him in the marketplace on purpose to fulfill the prophecy. Realizing that he has new responsibilities as king after seeing the state of Hagsgate, Lír returns to rebuild it after accompanying Schmendrick and Molly to the outskirts of his kingdom. The Unicorn returns to her forest. She tells Schmendrick that she is different from all the other unicorns now, because she knows what it's like to feel love and regret. Schmendrick and Molly later come across a princess in trouble and he tells her to go to Lír because he is the hero to save her. Schmendrick and Molly leave this story into another as they sing a love song together. ==Characters== *The Unicorn is the protagonist of the story. She leaves the safety of her forest upon learning that she is the last unicorn in the world, with information about the Red Bull as her only clue. When she first encounters the Red Bull, Schmendrick manages to inadvertently change the Unicorn into a human female to confuse the Red Bull and force its withdrawal. Schmendrick calls her \\"Lady Amalthea\\" so as not to arouse King Haggard's suspicions. Beagle notes that he took the name \\"Amalthea\\" from a Greek deity with the same name. *The butterfly is an eccentric character who happens upon the Unicorn at the beginning of the story. While speaking in riddles and songs, he manages to give the Unicorn some vital information about the other unicorns' whereabouts. Beagle stated that the butterfly's dialogue is drawn from things that amused him and his childhood friend, Phil Sigunick, during a trip to Berkshire Hills where Beagle began writing the novel. *Mommy Fortuna is a wicked old witch, who uses her dark magic to run a sideshow carnival for profit. The carnival features what appear to be mythical creatures, but are actually just normal animals that have been enchanted, with the exception of the harpy, Celaeno. According to Beagle, the name \\"Fortuna\\" was taken from the Roman goddess of fortune, and German mythical hero Fortunatus. *Schmendrick is a bumbling magician who travels with Mommy Fortuna's traveling carnival out of pure necessity. Reduced to entertaining the sightseers who come to the carnival, Schmendrick wants nothing more than to become a true, powerful magician who does not rely on card tricks and cheap illusions. He sees Mommy Fortuna as an opportunity to gain experience, but when he sees the captured Unicorn for what she is, he decides to free her and join her on her quest. Schmendrick was a character Beagle had initially made up for his children's bedtime stories, and was called \\"the world's worst magician\\". The name \\"Schmendrick the Magician\\" is a parody of the character \\"Mandrake the Magician\\", and is also drawn from a Yiddish word that Beagle defines as \\"somebody out of his depth, the boy sent to do a man's job, someone who has expanded to the limits of his incapacity.\\" *Captain Cully is the leader of a second-rate band of outlaws in direct opposition to King Haggard. Although he attempts to be dashing and hospitable, Cully falls victim to his own jealousy of famous mythical outlaws such as Robin Hood, an illusion of whom Schmendrick inadvertently conjures. According to Beagle, Captain Cully's name is drawn from an old English slang word for \\"buddy\\". *Molly Grue is Captain Cully's common-law wife. As a young woman she had eloped with him, naively attracted to the romance of loving a woodland fugitive and sharing his life. Unfortunately, this turned into years of serving Cully's ragged vagrants as their camp cook. She seeks a different reality from the one fate decided for her, and when she discovers Schmendrick leaving with the unicorn, she decides to follow them and do whatever she can to help the unicorn in her quest. Molly Grue's name is drawn from a French word meaning \\"crane\\". While never initially making the connection, Beagle notes that it is possible that the name was also inspired by Molly Epstein, his \\"favorite writing teacher in high school\\". *The Red Bull is a magical creature, blind but powerful, which is sensitive to the presence of any unicorn and tries to intimidate it into submission, thence driving it into the sea. Neither the Red Bull's affiliation with King Haggard nor its pattern of behaviour is explained, but these both end when finally the Last Unicorn stands up to it. *King Haggard is a miserable and cruel King who cares for no one, not even his adopted son Prince Lír. His loneliness and misery is only alleviated by the sight of unicorns, and this drove him to capture all of them for his own pleasure. He commands the powerful Red Bull, who has driven all the unicorns into the sea underneath of his castle by his own decree. The name \\"Haggard\\" is based on the actual word. Beagle stated that \\"on the one hand, it is a particular look, but on the other it's also a falconer's term. It's what you call an undomesticated hawk, a bird that knows the rudiments but is not reliable. If you fly a haggard, you might never see it again, it might go back to the wild.\\" He also went on to say that he has \\"never really been able to see [Haggard] as a villain\\", explaining that he saw much of his own character in Haggard to the point that he \\"felt sorry for him\\". * Prince Lír is a skilled hero who was adopted by King Haggard, who found him in the town of Hagsgate. Despite living with Haggard, Prince Lír is the opposite of his adopted father, living his life with valor, honor, and compassion for others. He falls in love with Lady Amalthea, not realizing what she is until the very end. For all of her arrogance towards humankind, the Unicorn falls in love with Lír. Beagle stated that he \\"knew that the prince's name had to be one syllable\\", and that he made a long list of one-syllable names to choose from. He chose \\"Lír\\" because he liked the sound of it, but later on noted that he had borrowed the name of a Celtic sea god, Llyr, and that the fact that Lír became \\"King Lír\\" after succeeding his adoptive father \\"echoed Shakespeare\\". ==Conception and creation== It took Beagle \\"close to two years\\" to write The Last Unicorn, and he states that \\"it was hard every step of the way\\". Beagle came up with the idea for the novel in 1962 while on an \\"artistic retreat\\" in Berkshire Hills after Viking Press rejected his novel The Mirror Kingdom. He stated that though the idea for the novel was \\"just suddenly there\\", he also said that he had \\"read tons of fantasy and mythology\\" from childhood, and that his mother told him that he had shared a story about unicorns during a visit to one of the elementary school classes she taught. He also mentioned that he loved the book The Colt from Moon Mountain by Dorothy Lathrop (a story about a unicorn in Kansas) as a child, and that Spanish artist Marcial Rodriguez had given him a painting of unicorns fighting bulls when he was seventeen. Once he had the idea, he did research on unicorns at the Pittsfield Library.Deluxe Edition, pp. 247–280. The 85-page manuscript that Beagle first wrote differs greatly from the current version of the book. Though the unicorn \\"is much the same\\", the story is set in modern times, and the unicorn is accompanied by a two-headed demon named Webster and Azazel. This original version was published as a limited edition hardcover by Subterranean Press titled The Last Unicorn: The Lost Version in 2006. Beagle stopped working on this initial manuscript in 1963, stating that \\"[i]t was a dead end\\", but picked the project up again in 1965. Beagle dedicated the novel to Olfert Dapper, a reference to whom Beagle had come across during his research, as well as Robert Nathan, whose novel One More Spring influenced Beagle's A Fine and Private Place. In 2012, Beagle published a novelet, Olfert Dapper's Day, a fictional tale of Dapper's travels. ==Publication history== In English There have been many print editions of The Last Unicorn. A corrected, definitive English-language text was prepared for the 2007 Deluxe Edition and used also in the trade paperback 40th Anniversary Edition (Roc Books, 2008). The Deluxe Edition was available for purchase only from Barnes & Noble, with co-publishers Roc imprint and Barnes & Noble (OCLC 243775547).. Retrieved 2012-04-26. Beside the corrected text of the novel it included an edition of the sequel and new material including cover illustration by the prominent fantasy and children's book illustrators Leo and Diane Dillon. Audiobook In 2004, Beagle recorded an unabridged audiobook of his novel for Conlan Press. The audiobook was sold in three formats with varying prices: as downloadable MP3 files (released in 2005), an MP3 CD, and as an eight-CD collector's set containing the audiobook on seven audio CDs and an exclusive interview with Beagle on the eighth.

At the end of December 2008, Peter S. Beagle announced that he had written several new stories which were directly or indirectly linked to The Last Unicorn. These included three unicorn stories (\\"The Story of Kao Yu\\" about a Chinese ki-lin, \\"My Son Heydari and the Karkadann\\", and \\"Olfert Dapper's Day\\", a fictional account of the Dutch physician and writer's encounter with a unicorn in the Maine woods) and two Schmendrick stories (\\"The Green-Eyed Boy\\" and \\"Schmendrick Alone\\"). In 2017, these stories were gathered in a short story collection titled The Overneath. \\"The Green-Eyed Boy\\", which earlier appeared in the September/October 2016 issue of Fantasy and Science Fiction magazine, describes the early days of Schmendrick's apprenticeship under Nikos. A third completed Schmendrick story was also mentioned by Beagle in December 2008. IDW Publishing published a six-issue comic book adaptation of The Last Unicorn beginning April 2010. It will be followed by an adaptation of A Fine and Private Place.\\"Wondercon Special Guests\\" Comic-Con magazine; Winter 2010; Page 18. The short story collection Sleight of Hand from 2011 contains a Schmendrick story titled \\"The Woman Who Married the Man in the Moon\\", and \\"Oakland Dragon Blues\\", a story concerning the fate of the dragon from Beagle's abandoned early version of The Last Unicorn (circa 1962). 2017 saw the publication of a novella titled In Calabria, in which the appearance of a unicorn on a quiet Italian farm leads to upheaval, violence and death. ==Adaptations== Rankin/Bass In 1982 the novel was made into an animated film of the same name directed and produced by Rankin/Bass for ITC Entertainment, with a screenplay written by Beagle himself and animated by Topcraft (predecessor of Studio Ghibli). The music was composed and written by Jimmy Webb and performed by America. The voice actors include Christopher Lee, Angela Lansbury, Alan Arkin, Jeff Bridges, and Mia Farrow. The first DVD release of the film by Lionsgate was of poor quality, but a \\"25th Anniversary Edition\\" DVD with superior quality was released in February 2007. Continent Films In addition, a live-action adaptation of the original book has been announced as in development for several years, but it is not clear what progress (if any) has been made towards production. In February 2006, Continent Films unveiled a new official website for the project which made clear that the film was still in development. It was not yet funded, did not have a shooting script, and had not been cast. In the new website, all actor names but Christopher Lee's had been removed; and even Lee's involvement was revealed to be nothing more than a promise to appear in the film if he was available and if terms could be worked out with his agent. Lee passed away in 2015 and the website was changed in April of 2016 to promote the 2015 film, Angels in Notting Hill, which was Lee's final appearance on screen. The website was changed back in August to The Last Unicorn and is still under construction as of January 2020. Stage adaptation In 1988, a stage adaptation of the novel was presented by the Intiman Playhouse in Seattle. Peter S. Beagle wrote the script, which was a musical presented in collaboration with Pacific Northwest Ballet. The production was directed by Elizabeth Huddle. In fall 2009, a new stage adaptation was presented in Chicago by Promethean Theatre Ensemble.Trailer, The Last Unicorn, Promethean Theatre Ensemble ==Reception== Cliff Ramshaw reviewed The Last Unicorn for Arcane magazine, rating it a 10 out of 10 overall.

The zoo contained 89 species of mammals, 49 species of reptiles and 175 species of birds, with a total of over 2,500 animals. The institution's goals are to conserve species, produce research and to educate the public. In June 2016 the city formed a bias about the zoo's cruelty. They had to close the 140-year-old zoo and relocate most of the animals to nature reserves, including Temaikèn. The zoo property will be converted into an ecopark. ==History== The entrance of the zoo in the corner of Avenida Sarmiento and Avenida del Libertador, circa 1890s. President Domingo Sarmiento was responsible for the laying out of the Parque Tres de Febrero in land previously owned by Juan Manuel de Rosas. The project was begun in 1874; the park was opened on November 11, 1875, and included a small section dedicated for animals. This area was owned by the Federal Government until 1888 when it was transferred to the City of Buenos Aires. In that year, Mayor Antonio Crespo created the Buenos Aires Zoo, and separated it from the rest of the park. Its first director Eduardo Ladislao Holmberg was appointed in 1888 and stayed in that position for 15 years. He was the major designer of the zoo. Holmberg completed the assignment of the different parks, lakes and avenues, and began the exhibition of the 650 animals that the zoo had at that time. In that period zoos around the world did not have the same function as they do today; their main goal was recreational, and they had less space for animals and a large recreational area for visitors. Clemente Onelli was the director from 1904 to 1924 and promoted the Zoo Gardens. Onelli added pony, elephant and camel rides to the zoo and increased the number of visitors (from 1,500 to 15,000) during his first year of office. He is also responsible for most of the Romanesque buildings at the zoo. Don Adolfo Holmberg, nephew of the first director, took over as directory in 1924 and headed the zoo until 1944, after which a succession of political appointees let the zoo deteriorate. In 1991 the zoo was privatized, and the program to get the animals out from behind bars and into more naturalistic habitats began. The zoo's last polar bear, Winner, died of fever in 2012. In December 2014, a Buenos Aires court ruled that a 29-year-old female Sumatran orangutan named Sandra living at the zoo was a \\"non-human person\\" who was entitled to some basic rights and could be liberated from her enclosure. In May 2020 Elephant Mara, who had been living in the zoo since 1995, was moved and released to the Mato Grosso Elephant Sanctuary in Brazil. ==Animals and exhibits== The \\"Palace of the Elephants\\", inspired by a Hindu temple architecture, as seen in 1904. The grassy areas of the park are full of native birds and rodents, which came to the zoo for the food thrown to the animals by visitor. Nutria, rabbits, and peacock roam the park's grounds freely. A variety of monkeys and small mammals inhabited the zoo. Although some were in cages, others are located on the islands in the zoo's many ponds, or roam free. At the Farm of the Zoo (La Granja Del Zoo), visitors used to pet and feed ponies, donkeys, sheep, and goats. This part of the zoo was also home to turkeys, chickens, roosters, pigs, rabbits, cows, and horses. At the Aquarium, visitors could see many penguins, as well as fresh water fish including piranha and sea dwellers such as striped bream, grouper, black sea bass, sea catfish, and many tropical fish. The aquarium also had a seal and sea lion show. The Reptile house was home to most of the zoo's reptiles. The Tropical Rainforest did not house many animals. It was a two- story building displaying tropical plant life and contained an indoor waterfall. A large iguana was kept on the grounds outside the exit from this exhibit. Big cats at the zoo included white tigers, pumas, cheetahs, jaguars, and lions. The lions were housed in a castle complex with its own moat. Four white tiger cubs, two males and two females, recently born (January 14, 2013) from Cleo a Bengal white tiger, were on display at the zoo for the public to visit until the zoo's closure. Other animals at the zoo included red panda, camels, llamas, giraffes, bison, hippos, and elephants. Camels were exhibited amidst Moroccan-style architecture. The flamingoes were in a lake near the entrance near Byzantine \\"ruins\\" and kangaroos were surrounded by aboriginal paintings. The elephant house was built to look like the ruins of an Indian temple. ==Gallery== File:Porton-zoologico-buenos-aires.JPGArc in the entrance on Las Heras Avenue File:Zoo de Buenos Aires2.jpgHindu temple for the llamas and vicuñas (1903) File:Zoo de Buenos Aires3.jpgThe Swan Lake File:Zoo de Buenos Aires4.jpgEntrance on the corner of Sarmiento and Del Libertador Avenues File:Lake at the Zoológico de Buenos Aires.jpgByzantine ruins brought from Trieste by Eduardo Schiaffino File:Templo hindu zoo ba.jpgPalace of the Elephants File:Couple at the Buenos Aires Zoo in 1911.pngA couple at the zoo in 1911 ==ReferencesExternal links== *Buenos Aires Eco-park (former zoo) * *History of the Zoo Zoo Category:Buildings and structures in Buenos Aires Category:Zoos in Argentina Category:National Historic Monuments of Argentina Category:Zoos established in 1875 Category:Zoos disestablished in 2016 ","title":"Buenos Aires Eco-Park (formerly Zoo)"},{"id":"5559303","text":"StarFire is a wide-area differential GPS developed by John Deere's NavCom and precision farming groups. StarFire broadcasts additional \\"correction information\\" over satellite L-band frequencies around the world, allowing a StarFire-equipped receiver to produce position measurements accurate to well under one meter, with typical accuracy over a 24-hour period being under 4.5 cm. StarFire is similar to the FAA's differential GPS Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS), but considerably more accurate due to a number of techniques that improve its receiver-end processing. ==Background== Two Navcom SF-2040G Receivers StarFire came about after a meeting in 1994 among John Deere engineers who were attempting to chart a course for future developments. At the time, a number of smaller companies were attempting to introduce yield- mapping systems combining a GPS receiver with a grain counter, which produced maps of a field showing its yield. The engineers felt this was one of the most interesting developments in the industry, but the accuracy of GPS, then still using Selective Availability, was simply too low to produce a useful map. The various providers went bankrupt over the next few years. In 1997, a team was formed to solve the problem of providing a more accurate GPS fix. Along with members of John Deere's engineering team, a small project at Stanford University also took part, along with NASA engineers at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. They decided to produce a dGPS system that differed fairly dramatically from similar systems like WAAS. ==Addressing GPS Inaccuracy== In theory the GPS signal with Selective Availability turned off offers accuracy on the order of 3 m. In practice, typical accuracy is about 15 m. Of this 12 m, about 5 m is due to distortion from \\"billows\\" in the ionosphere, which introduce propagation delays that makes the satellite appear farther away than it really is. Another 3 to 4 m is accounted for by errors in the satellite ephemeris data, which is used to calculate the positions of the GPS satellites, and by clock drift in the satellite's internal atomic clocks. dGPS correct for these errors by comparing the position measured using GPS with a known highly accurate ground reference, and then calculating the difference and broadcasting it to users. Some of these corrections apply to any location - the corrections to the clocks and ephemeris data for instance. In contrast, the billows cover only a certain portion of the sky, so a correction measured at any one ground station is only really useful for receivers located nearby. To make the corrections accurate over a large area, one would need to deploy many ground reference stations and broadcast a considerable amount of data for finely divided locations. For instance, WAAS uses twenty-five stations in the continental US, developing a grid spaced 5x5 degrees. StarFire instead uses an advanced receiver to correct for ionospheric effects internally. To do this, it captures the P(Y) signal that is broadcast on two frequencies, L1 and L2, and compares the effects of the ionosphere on the propagation time of the two. Using this information, the ionospheric effects can be calculated to a very high degree of accuracy, meaning the StarFire dGPS can compensate for variations in propagation delay. The second P(Y) signal is encrypted and cannot be used by civilian receivers directly, but StarFire doesn't use the data contained in the signal; it only compares the phase of the two signals instead. This is expensive in terms of electronics, requiring a second tuner and excellent signal stability to be useful, which is why the StarFire-like solution is not more widely used (at least when it was being created). With the ionospheric correction handled internally, the StarFire dGPS signal is greatly reduced in the amount of information it needs to carry, which consists of a set of correction signals for the satellite data alone. Since these corrections are globally valid, and there are only 24 satellites in operation at any time, the total amount of information is quite limited. StarFire broadcasts this data at 300 bits per second, repeating once a second. The corrections are generally valid for about 20 minutes. In addition to ephemeris and clock corrections, the signal also contains information on the health of each satellite, offering quality-of-service data in near real-time, with about a 3-second delay in updating the signals from the ground station. ==Versions== StarFire has developed through two versions. The first, retroactively known as SF1, offered 1-sigma accuracy of about 1 m. Its error was about 15 to 30 cm, meaning that while the displayed position (absolute accuracy) might be off by about 1 m, it could return you to within centimeters of a previously measured spot (relative accuracy). This was enough for the intended role, field surveying. This system was first offered in 1998, and since its replacement the SF1 signal is apparently now offered for free. Survey crew using the pole- mounted Navcom SF-2040G receiver The newer system, SF2, was introduced in 2004. It dramatically improves accuracy, with a 1-sigma absolute accuracy of about 4.5 cm. In other words, StarFire will leave you within 4.5 cm of a particular geographical point 65% of the time, and be accurate to under 10 cm around 95% of the time (2-sigma). The relative accuracy is likewise improved, to about 2.5 cm. Even if the StarFire correction signal is lost for more than 20 minutes, the internal ionospheric corrections alone result in accuracy of about 3 m. StarFire receivers also receive WAAS signals, ignoring their ionospheric data and using their (less detailed) ephemeris and clock adjustment data to provide about 50 cm accuracy. In comparison, \\"normal\\" GPS receivers generally offer about 15 m accuracy, and ones using WAAS improve this to about 3 m. ==Reference Stations== When initially deployed, StarFire used seven reference stations in the continental US. The corrections generated at these stations are sent to two redundant processing stations (one co- located with a reference/monitor site), and then the resulting signal is uplinked from an east-coast US station. All of the stations are linked over the internet, with dedicated ISDN lines and VSAT links as backups. The resulting signals were broadcast from an Inmarsat III channel. Additional StarFire networks were later set up in South America, Australia and Europe, each run from their own reference stations and sending data to their own satellites. As use of the system grew, the decision was made to link the various \\"local area\\" networks into a single global one. Today the StarFire network uses twenty-five stations worldwide, calculating and uplinking data from the US stations as before. The data collected at these stations is not location-dependent, in contrast to most dGPS, and the large number of sites is used primarily for redundancy. ==Variants== John Deere also sells a Real Time Kinematic dGPS, StarFire RTK. RTK consists of a small tripod-mounted GPS receiver that uses StarFire signals to perform its own dGPS calculations relative to a point, normally the corner of a field. The unit then broadcasts these corrections over a radio link to the equipment-mounted receivers. RTK offers absolute accuracy of about 2 cm, and relative accuracy in the millimeters. This sort of accuracy is used for fully automated equipment with autodrive systems. ==See also== * GNSS Augmentation * GPS signals ==ReferencesExternal links== *John Deere’s StarFire System: WADGPS for Precision Agriculture *Nothing Runs Like a Precision Farming System Category:Global Positioning System Category:John Deere ","title":"StarFire (navigation system)"},{"id":"5559312","text":"Salām bin Abī 'l-Huqayq or Abu Rafi () was a Jewish poet of early 7th century Arabia who financed and assisted the Pagan tribes who were fighting the prophet Muhammad. He was killed in the Expedition of 'Abdullah ibn 'Atik.Killing of Salam bin Abi Al-Huqaiq, Witness-Pioneer.com The foundation of the community By Ṭabarī, pg 100 He composed satirical verse (hija') about Muhammad and other early Muslim leaders. When men of the Banu Aus assassinated Ka'b ibn al-Ashraf, some Khazraj tribesman including Abdullah ibn Unays went to Muhammad and received his permission to kill Sallam. Muhammad ibn Jarir al- Tabari describes the assassination thus: :When they got to Khaybar they went to Sallam’s house by night, having locked every door in the settlement on the inhabitants. Now he was in an upper chamber of his to which a ladder led up. They mounted this until they came to the door and asked to be allowed to come in. His wife came out and asked who they were and they told her that they were Arabs in search of supplies. She told them that their man was here and that they could come in. When we entered we bolted the door of the room on her and ourselves fearing lest something should come between us and him. His wife shrieked and warned him of us, so we ran at him with our swords as he was on his bed . . . . When we had smitten him with our swords Abdullah bin Unays bore down with his sword into his belly until it went right through him.

Common names include elder, elderberry, black elder, European elder, European elderberry, and European black elderberry. It grows in a variety of conditions including both wet and dry fertile soils, primarily in sunny locations. Elder is cited as a poisonous plant for mammals, and as a weed in certain habitats. The plant is a very common feature of hedgerows and scrubland in Britain and northern Europe, but also is widely grown as an ornamental shrub or small tree. Both the flowers and the berries have a long tradition of culinary use, primarily for cordial and wine. The Latin specific epithet nigra means \\"black\\", and refers to the deeply dark colour of the berries. Although elderberry is commonly used in dietary supplements and traditional medicine, there is no scientific evidence that it provides any benefit for maintaining health or treating diseases. ==Description== Fruit cluster Flowers Elderberry is a deciduous shrub or small tree growing to tall and wide, rarely reaching tall. The bark, light grey when young, changes to a coarse grey outer bark with lengthwise furrowing, lenticels prominent.Clapham, A.R., Tutin, T.G. and Warburg, E.F. 1968 Excursion Flora of the British Isles Second Edition Cambridge. The leaves are arranged in opposite pairs, 10–30 cm long, pinnate with five to seven (rarely nine) leaflets, the leaflets 5–12 cm long and 3–5 cm broad, with a serrated margin. The young stems are hollow.Vedel, H. and Lange, J. 1971. Trees and Bushes in Wood and Hedgerow. p.196. Methuen and Co. Ltd. The English term for the tree is not believed to come from the word \\"old\\", but from the Anglo Saxon æld, meaning fire, because the hollow stems of the branches were used as bellows to blow air into a fire. The hermaphroditic flowers have five stamens,Parnell, J. and Curtis, T. 2012. Webb's An Irish Flora. Cork University Press. which are borne in large, flat corymbs 10–25 cm diameter in late spring to mid-summer, the individual flowers are ivory white, 5–6 mm diameter, with five petals; they are pollinated by flies. The fruit is a glossy, dark purple to black berry 3–5 mm diameter, produced in drooping clusters in late autumn; they are an important food for many fruit-eating birds, notably blackcaps. Range of European Sambucus nigra Natural range of North American Sambucus nigra subspecies Subspecies There are several other closely related species, native to Asia and North America, which are similar, and sometimes treated as subspecies of Sambucus nigra. The blue or Mexican elderberry, Sambucus mexicana, is now generally treated as one or two subspecies of Sambucus nigra subsp. canadensis and Sambucus nigra subsp. caerulea. ==Habitat== Hedges, waste-ground roadsides, and woods are the typical habitats for the species. S. nigra is recorded as very common in Ireland in hedges as scrub in woods.Hackney, P. 1992. Stewarts and Corry's Flora of the North-east of Ireland. Institute of Irish Studies The Queen's University of Belfast. (HB)Webb, D.A., Parnell, J. and Doogue, D. 1996. An Irish Flora. Dundalgan Press Ltd, Dundalk. ==Cultivation== Some selections and cultivars have variegated or coloured leaves and other distinctive qualities, and are grown as ornamental plants. The following cultivars have gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit: *S. nigra f. porphyrophylla ‘Eva’ *S. nigra f. laciniata *S. nigra f. porphyrophylla 'Gerda' (syn. 'Black Beauty') ==Culinary uses== Elderberry jam The dark blue or purple berries are mildly poisonous in their raw state.Professor Julia Morton, University of Miami Unripe berries, the seeds of the fruit, and all green parts of the plant are poisonous, containing cyanogenic glycosides (Vedel & Lange 1960). The berries are edible after cooking and may be used to make jam, jelly, chutney, and Pontack sauce. In Scandinavia and Germany, soup made from the elderberry (e.g. the German Fliederbeersuppe) is a traditional meal. Commonly, the flowerheads are used in infusions, giving a drink in Northern Europe and the Balkans. These drinks are sold commercially as elderflower cordial.Kikbracken, J. 1995. Easy way guide Trees. Larousse. In Europe, the flowers are made into a syrup or cordial (in Romanian: Socată, in Swedish: fläder(blom)saft, in Danish: hyldeblomstsaft / hyldedrik), which is diluted with water before drinking. The popularity of this traditional drink recently has encouraged some commercial soft drink producers to introduce elderflower-flavoured drinks (Fanta Shokata, Freaky Fläder). The flowers also may be dipped into a light batter and then fried to make elderflower fritters. Both flowers and berries may be made into elderberry wine. In Hungary, an elderberry brandy is made that requires 50 kg of fruit to produce 1 litre of brandy. In south-western Sweden, it is traditional to make a snaps liqueur flavoured with elderflower. Elderflowers are used in liqueurs such as St- Germain, and in a mildly alcoholic sparkling elderflower 'champagne', although a more alcoholic home-made version can be made. In Beerse, Belgium, a variety of jenever called beers vlierke is made from the berries. ==Traditional medicine== Sambuci flos: dried sambucus nigra flowers as used in herbal tea jelly ear fungus may be found on elder trees This plant is used in traditional medicine by native peoples and herbalists. Extracts of the flowers and fruits are used for cold and flu symptoms, although there is no high- quality clinical evidence that it is effective for treating any disease. Potential for poisoning Consumption of raw elderberries, leaves, bark, and stems, if not properly prepared, may cause nausea, vomiting, and severe diarrhea through the toxic effects of cyanogenic glycosides. Elderberry plant constituents or products should not be consumed during pregnancy or by people with allergies or gastrointestinal diseases. Elderberry products may cause adverse effects when used with prescription drugs. ==Diseases== Elder whitewash fungus (Hyphodontia sambuci) Like other elderberries, Sambucus nigra is subject to elder whitewash fungus and jelly ear fungus. ==Wildlife value== An elder growing as an epiphyte on a sycamore Elder rates as fair to good forage for animals such as mule deer, elk, sheep, and small birds. It is classified as nesting habitat for many birds, including hummingbirds, warblers, and vireos. Ripe elderberries are a favorite food for migrating band-tailed pigeons in northern California, which may sometimes strip an entire bush in a short time. It is also a larval host to the spring azure.The Xerces Society (2016), Gardening for Butterflies: How You Can Attract and Protect Beautiful, Beneficial Insects, Timber Press. It is good habitat for large and small mammals. Poisonous to mammals Except for the flowers and ripe berries (but including the ripe seeds), all parts of the plant are poisonous to mammals, containing the cyanogenic glycoside sambunigrin (C14H17NO6, CAS number 99-19-4). The bark contains calcium oxalate crystals. ==Other uses== The strong-smelling foliage was used in the past, tied to a horse's mane, to keep flies away while riding. ==ReferencesFurther reading== * *Rushforth, K.

It is Aarne-Thompson type 442. Arthur Rackham, 1917 ==Synopsis== A beautiful but poor servant girl traveled with the family she worked for when robbers attacked them. She hid behind a tree, but no one else survived. She lamented her fate, and a dove came to her with a golden key. It told her to unlock a tree and she found food there. In the evening, it brought her one to a tree with a bed. She lived like this for many days. When the dove asked her to do something for it, she agreed. It told her to go to a house and go in. An old woman would greet her, but she should not answer. She should open an inner door, which will reveal a room full of splendid rings, but she should take a plain one. The old woman was quite angry, but the girl did not heed her. Then, when she could not see the plain ring, she saw the old woman trying to carry off a bird cage. She took it away from her. It held a bird, which held the ring in its beak, so she took it outside and waited against a tree. Two branches turned into arms about her as the tree turned into a handsome man who kissed her. He told her that the old woman was a witch who had turned him into a tree, and for two hours a day, he became a dove, and she had freed him. All his attendants turned back from trees to humans as well. With the prince being a king's son, they went to his father's kingdom and got married. ==In popular culture== \\"The Old Woman in the Wood\\" is featured in Grimm's Fairy Tale Classics, with several changes. The talking dove is an owl, his tree form only appears at the end, and in his owl form he has more direct interactions with the servant girl, here named Lisbeth. The witch attacks the family with a horde of goblins instead of a band of robbers. The tasks that Lisbeth faces are slightly different to the original ones: she must go inside the house when the witch isn't home; look for a specific magical key in the witch's treasury, one whose handle is shaped like a human head; use it on a specific door (which turns out to be the nose of a skull placed on top of a rotating shelf); then find a gold ring and bring it to the owl. In addition, she cannot talk or even scream while she is in the house. ==See also== * The Hut in the Forest * Jorinde and Joringel ==External links== * * The Old Woman in the Wood Category:Fictional servants Category:Grimms' Fairy Tales Category:Female characters in fairy tales Category:Fiction about shapeshifting Category:Witchcraft in fairy tales ","title":"The Old Woman in the Wood"},{"id":"5559346","text":"Marion Fresenius Fooshee (July 27, 1888 – January 4, 1956) was an American architect active in the Dallas, Texas (USA) area. The architect's name has also been spelled as Marion Fooshe.Fooshe&f;=false Marion Fooshee was Francis Marion and Margaret Christine (Fresenius) Fooshee's only child. Marion was born in Weatherford, Texas and spent his early years in Corpus Christi, Texas. At age seven, Marion's father died while the family was living in Corpus Christi. In 1898 he and his mother moved north to Dallas, where his mother established a boarding house at Live Oak Street and Haskell Avenue, in the current Bryan Place neighborhood. Fooshee spent the remainder of his youth there and attended Bryan High School, but did not go to college.. By Duncan T. Fulton III. Retrieved 14 June 2006. In 1911, Marion Fooshee was hired by H. B. Thompson to help design eclectic homes for the Dallas elite. Much of his designs are seen on Swiss Avenue and in the Munger Place historic district in east Dallas. Some of his important designs include the Aldredge House at 5500 Swiss Avenue, built in 1917, and homes for Charles Sanger and Judge George C. Greer. Fooshee was a tall Southern gentleman who was friendly and easygoing-- his demeanor fitted Thompson's clientele very well, and several projects, including the palatial Orville Throp residence in Highland Park, 4908 Lakeside, built 1915, are generally credited to Thompson and Fooshee. At the outbreak of World War I, Fooshee entered officers' training camp and was sent to the Bethlehem Ship Yards in San Francisco where he performed architectural work for the Navy. In 1918 he was discharged and he began an independent architectural practice in Dallas. James B. Cheek, who Fooshee met in Thompson's office around 1914, joined Fooshee's practice soon after. In one point, the practice was apparently located in Wichita Falls. In Dallas, Fooshee and Cheek solidified their reputation for designing large homes for the very wealthy. They typically worked independently on their residential commissions; Fooshee is credited with 3606 Cornell in Highland Park (ca. 1923). They also built apartment buildings and duplexes, including much of the 4400 block of Westway in Dallas, where both Fooshee and Cheek lived. In 1920, Fooshee was appointed architect for the Dallas Park Board, and the firm's practice expanded into civic and commercial structures. Among the projects built were Highland Park Village (ca. 1930-1935), the first self-contained shopping center in the nation, though the project is generally credited to Cheek. Fooshee and Cheek was one of eleven architectural firms involved in the construction and design of the Hall of State at the Texas Centennial Exposition in Fair Park. They were also involved in the designing of the aquarium, and Cheek designed the United States Federal Exhibits Building. They also designed many gas stations, motels, and several of the state's first radio and television stations. Fooshee is credited with designing the Grand Court Tourisst Lodge in 1931 and a Magnolia Service Station in Dallas. His firm was noted for their Spanish Colonial designs. Also, mausoleums were considered a specialty of the firm. In June 1927, Fooshee married Annie Linda Atkins of St. Louis. The two had a daughter, but Annie died in 1931. Fooshee then married Peggy Montague Neale in June 1940, and the two also had a daughter. Fooshee was a member of the Dallas Country Club and president of the Idlewild Club. He also helped organize St. Michael and All Angels Episcopal Church and designed its first building. He was also a member of the Dallas City Plan Commission, the American Institute of Architects, the Junior Chamber of Commerce, and he played a key role in an attempt to remodel the historic Union Station in Dallas. Fooshee continued in his architectural practice until he suffered a heart attack and died on 4 January 1956. He is buried in Hillcrest Memorial Park in Dallas, the site of his first noted mausoleum. == References == Category:1888 births Category:1956 deaths Category:Architects from Texas Category:People from Dallas Category:History of Dallas ","title":"Marion Fresenius Fooshee"},{"id":"5559359","text":"The is a DC electric multiple unit (EMU) commuter train type introduced in 1985 by Japanese National Railways (JNR), and currently operated by East Japan Railway Company (JR East), West Japan Railway Company (JR West) and Kereta Commuter Indonesia in Indonesia. ==Operations== JR East (in alphabetical order) * Musashino Line: 8-car 205–0 series sets (some sets are powered by 205-5000 intermediate motor car units modified from 205–0 with AC motors) * Nambu Branch Line: 2-car 205–1000 series sets (x3) (from 2002) (rebuilt by JR East from former 205–0 series sets) * Nikkō Line: Refurbished 4-car 205–600 series sets with toilets (x4) (from March 2013) * Sagami Line: 4-car 205–500 series sets (x13) (from 1991) * Senseki Line: 4-car 205–3100 series sets (from 2004) (rebuilt by JR East from former 205–0 series sets with passenger- operated door controls, toilets, and passenger seating which can be arranged in either transverse or longitudinal) * Tsurumi Line: 3-car 205–1100 series sets (x9) (from 25 August 2004) (rebuilt from former 205-0 sets) * Utsunomiya Line: Refurbished 4-car sets with toilets (x8) (from March 2013) JR West (in alphabetical order) * Nara Line: 4-car JR West 205-0 and 205–1000 series sets (transferred from Hanwa line services) Kereta Commuter Indonesia (in alphabetical order) * Duri-Tangerang Line:12-car 205 series sets since 2018. * Jakarta Kota-Bogor Line: 8-car, 10-car (since 2014) and 12-car (since 2015) 205 series sets. * Jakarta Kota-Cikarang Line: 8-car (since 2014), 10-car (since 2015), and 12-car (since 2015) 205 series sets. * Jatinegara-Bogor Line: 8-car (since 2014), 10-car (since 2016) 205 series sets. * Rangkasbitung Line: 10-car (since 2016), 12-car (since 2020, plan) 205 series sets ==Former operations== Interior of a former Yamanote Line 205 series 6-door car in April 2002 Interior of a Keiyo Line 205–0 series 4-door car in June 2008 Interior of 205 set 29 (formerly set M15) in June 2018 * Chuo-Sobu Line: 10-car 205–0 series sets (from 1989 until 2001) * Hachikō Line: 4-car 205–3000 series sets (x5) (from 2003 until 15 July 2018) (former 205-0 sets modified by JR-East to form shorter trainsets for use in outer suburban services) (have passenger- operated door controls) * Hanwa Line: 4-car 205-1000 (built by JR-West) series sets (from 1988), 6- and 8-car 205–0 series sets (from 2006 until 2010; March 2013 until 16 March 2018) (formerly operated on JR-West Tokaido-Sanyo Local services as 7-car sets) * Kawagoe Line: 4-car 205–3000 series sets (x5) (from 2003 until 15 July 2018) (rebuilt by JR East from former 205–0 series sets, with passenger-operated door controls) / 10-car 205–0 series sets (from July 1989 until October 2016) * Keihin-Tohoku Line: 10-car 205–0 series sets (from 1989 until 1996) * Keiyō Line: 10-car 205–0 series sets (from 1990 until 2011) * Musashino Line: 8-car 205-5000 series sets (x36) and 8-car 205-0 series sets (x6) (from 1991 until October 2019 (205-0 series sets) and from 2002 until October 2020 (205-5000 series sets)) * Nambu Line: 6-car 205-0 (x31) (including 4 sets with 205-1200 driving trailers which were converted from 205–0 series intermediate trailers) (from 1989 until 9 January 2016) * Saikyo Line: 10-car 205–0 series set (from July 1989 until October 2016) (through service to Rinkai Line) * Tokaido-Sanyō Local service (Biwako, Kyoto, Kobe, Fukuchiyama lines): 7-car 205–0 series sets (from 1986 until 2006) * Tokaido Local Service (Kyoto, Kobe lines): 7-car 205–0 series sets (from 2011 until March 2013) (formerly operated on JR-West Hanwa Line as 6- and 8-car sets) * Yamanote Line: 11-car 205–0 series sets (from 1985 until 2005) (initially 10-car sets) * Yokohama Line: 8-car 205–0 series sets (x28) (from 1988 until 23 August 2014, initially 7-car sets) == Design variants == There have been many variations of the design of the 205 series trains. * 205-0 series: 6, 7, and 8-car sets used on the JR West Tokaido Line, and Hanwa Line. 6, 7, 8, 10, and 11-car sets used on the JR East Chuo-Sobu Line, Keihin-Tohoku Line, Keiyo Line, Nambu Line, Musashino Line, Saikyo Line, Yamanote Line, and Yokohama Line. * 205-500 series: 4-car sets used on the Sagami Line * 205-600 series: 4-car sets for use on the Nikko Line and Utsunomiya Line from 16 March 2013 * 205-1000 series: 4-car JR-West sets that formerly ran on Hanwa Line.

The first set entered service on the Yamanote Line on 1985, and has remained a staple of the JR fleet network ever since. It was originally built with resistor-controlled traction systems, as they were cheaper to produce than thyristor chopper-controlled motors or something similar to that, but this was somewhat dated technology due to the advent of the variable frequency drive. It uses a traditional design with an unpainted stainless steel body very much like most trains of the period. Each set has a different color scheme to indicate which area the sets serve. The 205 series is currently used on both JR East and JR West lines, and the 205–0 series will be finally ended operation in JR East on 2020 since 524 of 205–0 series vehicles had been shipped to Jakarta, Indonesia from 2013 to 2020 to continue their operation overseas replacing aging commuter trains and mass improvement of public transportation in Greater Jakarta by train, and there are still 205–0 series operational in JR West lines. It was manufactured from 1984 to 1991 and initially built 10-car trainsets for test-run conducted in 1984 for JNR Yamanote Line. It was manufactured by Tokyu Car Corporation, Hitachi for technical components, Nippon Sharyo, Kinki Sharyo, and Kawasaki Heavy Industries. The basic structure is similar to that of the subsequently manufactured vehicles like the 201 series & the 203 series, but the difference is that the window shape is a two-pane window panels with the upper stage descending and the lower stage rising. All four manufacturers were introduced to the Yamanote line in March 1985, and in 1991, like the other trains, the Saha 204-0 was introduced as a 6-door intermediate carriage for Yamanote Line to be assigned as new Car No. 10 to be coupled and form 11-car Yamanote Line trainsets from December 1991. In 2005, the Saha 204 intermediate carriages, were also transferred to the Saikyo line upon retirement from Yamanote Line, and also some of the existing Yamanote Line 205 series were transferred to the Keiyo line to continue their train operation until they ended on 2011. The trip number indicator of each leading car was initially introduced as a traditional roller-binding display as commonly used by other JNR rolling stocks, but in 1985, it was newly installed for the first time with the LCD type trip number indicator display and also later replaced along with the 0-subseries mass-produced vehicles. *JR East 205–0 series gallery File:Yamanote Line 205 series set 30 Tabata Station 20030202.JPGYamanote Line 205–0 series set 30 in February 2003 File:Keihin-Tohoku 205 Nishi-Nippori 199202.jpgA Keihin-Tohoku Line 205–0 series in February 1992 File:Model 205 -Saikyō Line- of JR East.jpgA Saikyo Line 205–0 series in November 2007 File:JR205-yokohama-line.JPGA Yokohama Line 205–0 series in April 2008 File:JRE-205EMU-Musashino-KeiyoLine.jpgMusashino Line (left) and Keiyo Line (right) 205–0 series trains in May 2006 File:Nanbu line 205kei Rapid.JPGA Nambu Line 205–0 series in April 2011 File:JRE 205-KeiyouLine Commuter Special Rapid.jpgA Keiyo Line 205–0 series (later design) in May 2008 *JR West 205–0 series gallery File:JNR-205-0EC.JPGA JR-West 205–0 series in original livery in February 2006.

The cars have folding seats to increase the number of standing spaces, increasing capacity in the morning when the busiest time is reached. The seats can be locked automatically by the train driver. The time when seats are available varies depending on the line section. On the Yamanote Line, Saikyo Line, and Rinkai Line, they are unlocked at 10:00. On the Yokohama Line the seats are unlocked at 9:00. In the same line area, the conductor unlocks at the same time. When the lock is released, a lamp installed at the end of the seat is turned on, and passengers can manually pull the seats out use the them (this is a manual type for safety). As for storage, it is automatically stored (using springs and gas dampers) at the push of a button after entering the depot without passengers. There is a sticker inside the car to indicate that you cannot use your seat until the cancellation time. Therefore, depending on the train, there were those that could be used near the unloading station and those that had seats that passengers did not pull out. Also, to prevent tampering, the seat once pulled out by the passenger is locked and cannot be manually stored. The body uses a panel structure developed by Kinki Vehicle to reduce costs and improve performance.Kinki Vehicle \\"Kinki Vehicle Ayumi 70th Anniversary 93P・125P article. This is a panel made of a reinforcing material called dimple board. The specifications were reviewed, and the height of each entrance was changed from 1,800 mm to 1,850 mm, one vertical window was placed between the doors, and the side windows were changed from the vertical dimension of 880 mm to 1,050 mm. This is also for the purpose of improving the physique of modern people and reducing the feeling of pressure in the car during rush hours. In addition to the panel-type structure, the gas damper-type balancer mechanism unit-type descending window to the side window and the customer door using Honeycomb structure have been a motivation to incorporate the technologies unique to Kinki vehicles. Unlike the conventional conical laminated rubber type, the bogie uses the roll rubber type axle box support type TR241B adopted in 651 series. In addition, the towing device has been changed from the link type to the Z link type (this cart system is only in the 900s and 0s).

The vehicle shown in the photograph uses a conical laminated rubber method instead of the roll rubber method. Due to the structure of the seat, the heating device cannot be installed under the seat as in the past, so floor heating, which is rarely used in railway cars, is adopted.Rail Magazine May 1990 issue \\"Neko PublishingSince the number of seats in a 6-door car decreases, the number of heaters installed underneath it naturally decreases. In order to improve this, it is not possible to increase the capacity of each seat heater because the heat generation is too large and the passengers may be burned. For this reason floor heating was adopted. In addition, a small sheathed heater is installed under the seat as before. This is an ancillary, the heater only works when the seat is occupied. The air conditioner uses the AU717 type (50,000 kcal/h・58.0 kW), which has a capacity of about 20% compared to the conventional model because the door opening is large. The control method is an inverter method that uses 600 V DC as the power source (conventionally, an operation rate control method that uses a three-phase AC source. The 100 series will be described later). On the ceiling, auxiliary blowers (line delia) are added from 4 to 6, and circulator is installed at the top of each door (12 places). In the car, the number of grab handles has been significantly increased from 98 (4 door intermediate car before expansion) to 150, and 5 stanchion poles with a protector wound in the central passageway. The installed position is not in the center of the former entrance plaza, but in front (between) of the storage seats. It was installed because the seats were retractable and there was no place to grab near the door. Since there are six doors in the car, the number of seats is 30, which is less than the number of ordinary 4-door vehicles (54 seats). However, the seat width for one person has been expanded to 450 mm. In addition, due to the peculiarity of the auxiliary seat that cannot be used due to the above time period, the 205 series does not have a priority seat. On the other hand, it is compatible with barrier-free by installing wheelchair space here by utilizing the end of the vehicle. The emergency door opener of each door is installed on the top of the door covered with glass, and the 0.900 series says \\"How to use, you can open the door by pulling the handle in this glass toward you\\" It is written as \\".\\", but since the 100s are in the same style as 209 series, \\"The door can be opened by hand by pulling the handle inside.\\" Has been done. In Yamanote Line cars,\\"Railway fan August 1990 issue\\" from Kyouyusha an information service using an in- vehicle display monitor has been started on a trial basis. This is intended for JR East to provide information in a timely manner in consideration of improving passenger services. As for the in-vehicle display monitor, the Saha 204-901 uses a 5-inch liquid crystal display, and the Saha 204-902 uses a 6-inch CRT type thin display, which is located above each door. There were 12 inspection lids on each side, 12 on each side, and 24 were installed for each. Broadcast contents include news, weather forecast, commercials by text broadcasting, PR information of JR East and environmental videos including sports information. It is something to flush. This is officially adopted in mass-produced vehicles. There is a receiving antenna in the ventilator on the roof, a tuner, a controller for control,, and these are displayed on the in- vehicle monitor via these. After that, since there is no support equipment for information provision equipment other than the same line, when E231-500 series was introduced, when Saikyo Line or Yokohama Line the liquid crystal display and the receiving antenna were removed. Only this vehicle did not have a destination indicator, but the Saikyo Line transfer car has some windows modified and installed with LED type. As mentioned above, with the replacement of the E231 series 500 series, operation on the Yamanote line ended on April 17, 2005, and 900 series 2 out of 2 900 series and 51 0 series operated on the same line From 2001 to 2008, both cars and 0-series cars were converted to at the Kawagoe Rolling Stock Center and operated on the Saikyo Line and Rinkai Line, and the remaining one was in 2003 in Kamakura. It was converted to the general rolling stock depot (currently Kamakura Rolling Stock Center) and operated with the 100 series newly placed on the same line on the Yokohama Line, but with the replacement of the E233-6000 series and -7000 series. As of February 2014, operations on the Saikyo and Rinkai lines and on the Yokohama Line have ended on August 23 of the same year.  Saha 204 type 900 series  On 27 February 1990 a new 6-door prototype car was produced, and two of which were manufactured. The 900 series (901/902) has been added, making it the only prototype car series division in this series. Originally located in the Yamate Electric Railway ward (currently Tokyo General Rolling Stock Center), it was connected to No. 9 and No. 2 cars of set Yate 42 (10 cars less than Kuha 205-42) in the same year March 10 it commenced commercial operation after the timetable revision. It is also being implemented to change the connecting position to cars 8 and 9 for testing the congestion situation. The size of the monitor screen in the car is different from that of the mass- produced car. In addition, there is a selective opening/closing function during quiet times (all 6 doors open/select only 4 out of 6 doors open), and the deadline is 2 open doors (2nd and 5th doors) The lamps that indicate were installed on both sides of the door outside the vehicle and next to the emergency door cock above the interior door. In addition, the shape of the luggage rack is a pipe type similar to the 100s, which is slightly higher than the mass-produced vehicle (height 1,950 mm). Other facilities are the same as the mass-produced cars. After various tests, mass production modification was installed from October to November 1990 when the mass production car was not completed, and the monitor screen inside the car was changed to the same 9-inch liquid crystal display as the mass production car. Replacement, removal of selective opening and closing functions, installation of auxiliary power supply device for own vehicle (described in the next 0 series), etc. are being implemented. Even after the 0's were connected, the two prototype cars were divided into one and connected (901 connected to set Yate 42, 902 connected to set Yate 60), and the connection formation was replaced several times. On 5 February 1996, with the addition of set Yate 42 when it moved to the Kawagoe train area (current Kawagoe rolling stock center), the 902 that was incorporated into the set Yate 49 at that time was discontinued. It was replaced with Saha 204–42 in the 0s, which had been treated, and then 902 became a reserved car. After that, the 902 was reassigned for the Saikyo Line from 30 June 2001, and the 901 was relocated to the same location from 5 December 2003. After being transferred to the Saikyo Line, 902 was incorporated into 8 flies and 901 was incorporated into 18 flies, and they were running on the same line. ==205-500 series== The 205–500 series of JR East operates 4-car sets used on the Sagami Line services since 1991, replacing the all Diesel railcars like the KiHa 30, KiHa 35 & KiHa 36 since it was newly introduced after electrification on the same year. Also have the newest look and among the last batch of 205 series made. ==205-600 series== The 205-600 subseries was created in 2013, when cars from former Keiyo Line and Saikyo Line ten-car sets were reformed between 2012 and 2013 to create twelve four-car sets for use on Nikko Line and Utsunomiya Line services, entering service from 16 March 2013, replacing ageing 107 series and 211 series sets. The four Nikko Line sets are finished in a livery with \\"classic ruby brown\\", \\"gold\\", and \\"cream\\" bodyside stripes. The Utsunomiya Line sets are finished in a livery with Shonan green and orange bodyside stripes.

Lane played college basketball for the University of Pittsburgh, where he was an All-American and led the NCAA in rebounding as a sophomore. ==High school career== Born in Akron, Ohio, Lane played shooting guard for Saint Vincent-Saint Mary High School and appeared in the McDonald's All-American Game. ==College career== He joined the Pittsburgh Panthers in 1985–86 as a 170-pound freshman. By his junior season, the 6'6\\" forward was 60 pounds heavier.

From 1907 to 1950 he served as regent for the claims of his two older disabled brothers. ==Early life== Elias was born at Biarritz, the youngest son of the deposed Duke Robert I of Parma and his first wife Princess Maria Pia of Bourbon-Two Sicilies (daughter of King Ferdinand II of the Two Sicilies). Elias with his mother, Maria Pia Despite the loss of the throne, His father Robert enjoyed considerable wealth. They owned castles at Schwarzau am Steinfeld near Vienna in Austria, Villa Pianore, between Pietrasanta and Viareggio in Italy, and the magnificent Château de Chambord in France (up until its confiscation in World War I). ==Marriage and family== On 25 May 1903 at Vienna, Elias married Archduchess Maria Anna of Austria (1882–1940), daughter of Archduke Friedrich, Duke of Teschen, and a niece of Queen Maria Cristina of Spain. Elias and Maria Anna had eight children, but only one of them did marry and had issue: *Princess Elisabetta of Bourbon- Parma (17 March 1904 – 13 June 1983); she died unmarried. *Prince Carlo Luigi of Bourbon-Parma (22 September 1905 – 26 September 1912); he died of poliomyelitis. *Princess Maria Francesca of Bourbon-Parma (5 September 1906 – 20 February 1994); she died unmarried. *Robert Hugo, Duke of Parma (7 August 1909 – 15 November 1974); he died unmarried. *Prince Francesco Alfonso of Bourbon-Parma (14 June 1913 – 29 May 1939); he died unmarried. *Princess Giovanna Isabella of Bourbon-Parma (8 July 1916 – 1 November 1949); she never married and was killed in a shooting accident in La Toledana, Spain. *Princess Alicia of Bourbon-Parma (13 November 1917 – 28 March 2017); she married Infante Alfonso, Duke of Calabria, and had issue. *Princess Maria Christina of Bourbon-Parma (7 June 1925 – 1 September 2009); she died unmarried. Through his fourth daughter, Princess Alicia, he is great-grandfather of Prince Pedro, Duke of Calabria, one of two claimants to the thone of the Two Sicilies. ==Regent for his brothers== In 1907 Elias' father Robert died and was succeeded in his ducal claims of Parma by his son Enrico who was mentally disabled. Less than four months later the Grand Marshal of the Austrian court declared Enrico and five of his siblings legally incompetent. Elias became regent for Enrico's claims and guardian for his disabled siblings. In 1907 Elias was made a knight of the Order of the Golden Fleece by the Emperor Franz Joseph of Austria. In 1910 Elias came to an agreement with his half-siblings, his father's children by his second wife, about the division of their father's estate. Elias was to have half of the estate in order to support his rank as head of the family; this half included the château de Chambord. In 1915 Chambord was sequestered by the French government as alien property, since Elias held a commission in the Austro-Hungarian Army.\\"Demands Seizure of Bourbon Estate\\", The New York Times ( 21 April 1915): 1; \\"France Takes Chambord\\", The New York Times ( 25 April 1915): 3. Liquidation proceedings were started in 1919 in application of the Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye, which gave the Allies the right to keep such property. Elias' half-brothers, Sixtus and Xavier took Elias to court to obtain a greater share of their father's estate. They claimed that the 1910 family agreement violated the French law which mandated equal division between siblings. In 1925 the French courts determined that Sixtus and Xavier should have a larger share, but in 1928 this judgement was overturned on appeal. In 1932 the court of cassation upheld the appeal on the grounds that there was a valid agreement between the siblings to an unequal division. Elias' rights to the château de Chambord were thereby recognised - but the wartime confiscation was upheld and Elias was financially compensated with 11 million francs. In 1939 Enrico died and was succeeded in his ducal claims of Parma by his brother Giuseppe who also was mentally disabled. Elias continued to act as regent. In 1950 Giuseppe died and Elias succeeded as pretender of Parma. Elias died at Friedberg, Styria in 1959. He and his wife are buried in the nearby village of Mönichkirchen. ==AncestryNotes== Category:1880 births Category:1959 deaths Category:People from Biarritz Category:House of Bourbon-Parma Category:Pretenders to the throne of Parma Category:Princes of Bourbon-Parma Category:Princes of Parma and Piacenza Category:Austro-Hungarian military personnel of World War I Category:Knights of the Golden Fleece of Austria ","title":"Elias, Duke of Parma"},{"id":"5559387","text":"Cover for a French edition of Les Habits Noirs.

In 1862, Féval founded the magazine Jean Diable, named after his eponymous Habits Noirs novel, and Émile Gaboriau, future creator of the police detective Monsieur Lecoq, a hero seemingly unrelated to the villainous Lecoq of the Habits Noirs, was his assistant. ==Novels== * Les Mystères de Londres (Gentlemen of the Night, serialized in Le Courrier Français, 1843–44; rep.

His family was in possession of the fort Qamus, situated near Khaybar. Like most of the Medina Jews, he took part in the quarrels between the two Arab tribes of that town, and was present at the battle of Bu'ath, 617, which took place in the territory of the Banu Qurayza. Al-Rabi was a poet of note. He had a contest at capping verses with the famous Arabic poet, al-Nabighah, the latter reciting one hemistich, while Al-Rabi had to supply the next, keeping to the same meter and finding a rhyme. He has been credited with the authorship of other poems, but upon dubious authority. One of these poems used to be recited by Abun, the son of the Caliph Uthman. From its contents, however (it criticizes the folly of his own people), it seems more likely to have been written by one of Abun's sons, who bore the same name as Al-Rabi. It might, then, have been composed after the submission of the Banu Qurayza. Al-Rabi's three sons (Al-Rabi ibn al-Rabi, Kinana ibn al-Rabi and Sallam ibn al-Rabi) were among Muhammad's most bitter opponents. An account of Al-Rabi can be found in vol. xxi. of the Kitab al-Aghani, ed. Brünnow, p. 91\\\\. He is cited among the Arabic Jewish poets by Moses ibn Ezra in his Kitab al-Muhadharah (Rev. Ét.

The table was used by monarchs from the 13th century onward for coronation feasts and state banquets. Edward I, the king who took the Stone of Scone from Scotland, was the first English monarch recorded to have used it. The mid 13th-century style of carving means that the table could date back to Henry III. Henry VIII used the table for feasts after his marriages to Catherine of Aragon and Anne Boleyn. The table was originally constructed with Purbeck marble, sourced from Dorset, and repaired over a 300 year period with the first major change occurring in 1307. The King's Table was broken into pieces by Oliver Cromwell following the English Civil War and buried under the Palace of Westminster. A new table was created during the English Restoration. The broken pieces of the original were placed in the foundations of a dais built in the 17th century in Westminster Hall, which was used by James II of England at his coronation banquet. The first piece of the table was rediscovered in the 1960s beneath the floor of Westminster Hall.

In NMR, nuclear magnetic moments are used to measure specific physical and chemical properties of materials. Relaxation of the nuclear spin system is crucial for all NMR applications. The relaxation rate depends strongly on the mobility (fluctuations, diffusion) of the microscopic environment and the strength of the applied magnetic field. As a rule of thumb, strong magnetic fields lead to increased sensitivity on fast dynamics while low fields lead to increased sensitivity on slow dynamics. Thus, the relaxation rate as a function of the magnetic field strength is a fingerprint of the microscopic dynamics. == Equipment== Apparatus and technological support of the method is constantly developed. An NMR relaxometer is a device for relaxation time measuring. Laboratory NMR relaxometers for NMR signal registration are available in small sizes. In NMR relaxometry (NMRR) only one specific NMRR parameter is measured, not the whole spectrum (which is not always needed). This helps to save time and resources and makes it possible to use an NMR relaxometer as a portable express analyzer in different branches of industry, science and technology, environmental protection, etc. ==ReferencesExternal links== * Field- cycling NMR relaxometry Category:Nuclear magnetic resonance ","title":"Relaxometry"},{"id":"5559460","text":"The hat tax, or hat duty, was a tax levied by the British Government from 1784 to 1811 on men's hats. The tax was introduced during the first ministry of Pitt the Younger and was designed to be a simple way of raising revenue for the government in a rough accordance with each person's relative wealth. It was supposed that the rich would have a large number of expensive hats, whereas the poor might have one cheap hat or none at all. The hat tax required hat retailers to buy a licence and to display the sign Dealer in Hats by Retail. The cost of the retail licence was two pounds for London and five shillings elsewhere. Each man's hat was required to have a revenue stamp pasted inside on its lining. The cost of the duty depended on the cost of the hat. For hats costing under four shillings, a duty of threepence was paid. For hats costing between four and seven shillings, sixpence was levied, and a shilling for those between seven and twelve shillings. For expensive hats over twelve shillings, the duty was two shillings. Heavy fines were given to anyone, milliner or hat wearer, who failed to pay the hat tax. However, the death penalty was reserved for forgers of hat-tax revenue stamps. The hat tax was not the only duty raised by the government on household items. The best known such tax was the window tax, which was implemented in 1697, and was not repealed until 1851. Other similar taxes were the dice duty (1711–1862), almanac tax (1711–1834), wallpaper tax (1712–1836), brick tax (1784–1850), glove tax (1785–94), hair-powder tax (1786–1869) and perfume tax (1786–1800). Although, these twenty-seven years saw rapid inflation, a shilling of that period had the purchasing power of about £3.40 today.

Those buried there are descendants of Huguenots who fled persecution in France following the revocation of the Edict of Nantes which had guaranteed religious freedom. They were encouraged to come to Ireland by James Butler, 1st Duke of Ormonde, who had spent twelve years in exile in France, after the Irish and Royalist forces were defeated by those of Oliver Cromwell. Ormonde's return to Ireland as Viceroy in 1662 coincided with the consolidation of power by Louis XIV, which put extra pressure on the Huguenots in France. Ormonde had come into contact with Huguenots in Paris and Normandy, and hoped that their skills and capital could help stimulate the Irish economy and introduce new industries.Raymond Hylton.

His parents were Taresh Chandra and Binodini Devi. The couple had six children. The eldest, Meghamala was married to the famous Professor of Algebra, K.P. Basu, both connected with the revolutionary movement. Their son Jitendranath Basu, along with Atul and his youngest brother Amar, was blacklisted, too, for participation in seditious activities. After his primary classes at Kumarkhali, Atul passed brilliantly his Matriculation in 1909 from the Kolkata Hindu School, to join the Scottish Churches College for Intermediate, and the Krishnath College at Berhampur for B.Sc. While preparing for his final M.Sc. examination at Presidency College, Kolkata, Atul had to interrupt his studies for his political commitment. The College and its hostel were humming with his radical associates, all future celebrities mostly in scientific research, like Satyendra Nath Bose, Megh Nad Saha, Jnan Ghosh, Jnan Mukherjee, Sishir Mitra, Sushil Acharya, Sailen Ghosh, Harish Simha, Jatin Sheth, Hiralal Ray.Ghose, Atulkrishna in Dictionary of National Biography,[abbrev. DNB], Edited by S.P. Sen, Volume II, Calcutta, 1974 ==Political background== Since 1906, with his cousin Nolinikanta Kar, Atul had been frequenting Jatindranath Mukherjee (Bagha Jatin) who was their neighbour in Kushtia Sub-division. They both entered the local Anushilan Samiti. W. Sealy in his Report will note \\"Atul Ghosh and Nolini Kanta Kar, two dangerous and important absconders of the gun- running conspiracy.\\" (p23).Terrorism in Bengal,[abbrev. Terrorism], Government of West Bengal, Volume V, 1995, p23 At Kolkata, thanks to Jatin, they both came very close to Sri Aurobindo. Whereas Nolini practised wrestling with Kikkar Singh, Atul became an expert trainer in self-defence at the Pataldanga branch of the Anushilan Samiti: Atul Krishna Ghosh & Jatindranath Mukherjee founded PATHURIAGHATA BYAM SAMITY which was an important centre of armed revolution of Indian National Movement. Here he came across a number of revolutionaries, including Sachin Sanyal’s Benares group and Biren Datta Gupta whom he recommended to Jatindranath. Biren received from the latter, in January 1910, the mandate to assassinate Samsul Alam, Deputy Superintendent of Police, who was man-handling the under-trial prisoners of the Alipore Bomb case.Notes given by Atulkrishna Ghosh and Nalinikanta Kar in sadhak-biplabi jatindranath, [abbrev. jatindranath], by Dr Prithwindra Mukherjee, West Bengal State Book Board, 1990, several references In connection with Biren’s successful mission, Jatindranath with forty-six associates were placed on trial in the Howrah conspiracy case. Inside the prison, Jatindranath learnt from his emissaries abroad that Germany was preparing for war against Great Britain. After his release in 1911, Jatindranath suspended all extremist activities, left Kolkata under the responsibility of Atul, himself forging a grand federation of regional units in the districts. A relentless organiser, Atul sheltered revolutionaries from various units as much in his parents’ house at Jaduboyra, as at the Kolkata residence of Meghamala and K.P. Basu, at 11 Mahendra Gossain's Lane, where there was a free dormitory with homely meals. Even leaders of rival parties like Pratul Ganguli of Dhaka admit having enjoyed this hospitality, at great expense and risk on Atul's side: \\"We became great friends with Atulkrishna and had confidence in him. I have very often been to his Darjipara residence and spent nights there. He had grown intimate with several of our members, almost close friends. We considered him to be, somewhat, our own colleague and he sincerely hoped to unite our parties so that we could all work together. Frankly speaking, it was thanks to his wish that I met Jatin Mukherjee…\\".biplabir jiban darshan, by Pratulchandra Ganguli, Calcutta, 1976, p23 Disappointed by the duplicity of the Dhaka branch, \\"some of its important workers, however, like Sachin Sanyal and Nagen (Girija) Datta, severed their connection with it and, introduced by Atulkrishna, worked with Rasbehari Bose in Upper India.\\" Atul's elder brother Aghorenath, a civil surgeon, often looked after the bullet wounds received by the patriots.DNB, II/p37 ==Jatin Mukherjee's right-hand man== According to Nixon's Report, probably in about 1913, or perhaps a little before, certain of the old members of the Kolkata Anushilan Samiti who, in the meantime, had been members of various athletic clubs, formed themselves into a branch of the Seva Samiti under Atulkrishna Ghosh: \\"The ostensible object of this samiti was a benevolent one. The first centre was at the house of Atul Ghosh. During the Burdwan floods, in 1913, many members of this samiti went there for the purpose of affording relief to the afflicted people.\\".Nixon's Report in Terrorism, Volume II, p590 Atul's efficiency and generosity as a leader became evident during this relief. Nixon further informs that the headquarters of the samiti were later shifted to the house of Jibantara Haldar, and later still to No. 83 Hari Ghosh's Street. \\"Of this organisation Amar Ghosh, the brother of Atul, was an important figure,\\" mentioned Nixon. \\"It was this samiti which formed the nucleus of the combined party which operated in Bengal in 1915. Purna Das of Madaripur brought some of his more audacious spirits along to it and later Pulin Mukherji alias Thakur, previously a member of the Dacca Anushilan Samiti, joined it and took a prominent part in the commission of outrages. Other members of the Dacca Anushilan Samiti severed their connection with that society and joined the party of Atul Ghosh. Bipin Behari Ganguli was in close connection with it and also the members of the Northern Bengal party. Jatindranath Mukherjee seems to have been in touch with the members of this samiti from the time of its formation, and immediately he came into Calcutta, the Seva Samiti acknowledged his leadership and became the real West Bengal party of 1915.\\".Nixon's Report, Terrorism, Vol. II, p590. During the Alipore Bomb prosecutions, though Rasbehari Bose had settled in North India with the help of Shashibhushan Raychaudhury, he maintained his contact with Bengal through Atul. Amarendra Chatterjee and Atul supplied him bombs for actions in up-country and, even, the one thrown on Viceroy Hardinge. Informed by Atul, Rasbehari could participate in the flood relief and the significant meetings of leaders. It was Atul, again, in September 1914, who was contacted by Gurudit Singh and other Komagata Maru patriots, coming from Vancouver with recommendation from Taraknath Das : he and Satish Chakravarti arranged with various regional units of the Jugantar to shelter them, before sending them to destinations in North India, fixed by Rasbehari. Furious to hear about the death of a jute-mill worker at Jagaddal, caused by the kick from a booted leg of an English supervisor, Atul was desperately looking for arms to avenge this atrocity. ==In need of arms== \\"The outbreak of war revivified the vague ideas of revolution which had been floating about in the mind of young Bengal for the last ten years and the hopes of those who had throughout been waiting for the opportunity, and the possibility of a successful revolt seemed imminent,\\" wrote Nixon. \\"It was probably some time in September 1914 that Jatin Mukherjee came to Calcutta in order to take such steps as England’s participation in a war with Germany seemed to call for in this direction.\\".Terrorism, Vol. II, p627 Judging the time ripe for them to make full preparations for a revolution, Jatin's men undertook taxi-cab robberies to provide funds for this purpose, as described in the Rowlatt Report. Hence, on 26 August 1914, Shrish Chandra Mitra (Habu), one of his loyal associates, smuggled fifty Mauser pistols and forty-six thousand cartridges from the Rodda (arms dealers) in Kolkata, handed them over to Atul, before disappearing for good. Jatin Mukherjee distributed these dreadful arms to various units. Conceived by Jatin, as does a skilful stage manager, Atul chalked out a series of daring overt acts under the immediate leadership of Naren Bhattacharya alias M.N. Roy: these are all duly catalogued in the Rowlatt Report. Successive emissaries returned from Europe and America with the good news of the arrival of arms obtained from German authorities by the Berlin Committee. Balasore was chosen by Germany to land a shipment. Jatin with a handful of associates took shelter there. Then Atul dispatched Harikumar Chakravarti, Dr Jatin Ghoshal, Satish Chakravarti and a batch of workers with boats, rifles and other requisites to the other selected port at Raymangal in the Sundarbans. When information came that the Police had discovered Jatin's hideout in Balasore, Naren Ghose Chaudhury proposed spontaneously to rush to the spot for a showdown; Jadugopal Mukherjee objected: \\"Dada is big enough to look after himself. Let us disperse.\\" Atul was stunned by this cynical order. After the failure of the Indo-German conspiracy and after Jatin's untimely death, disheartened Atul and other Jugantar leaders went underground in 1915, remaining so for about seven years. Even then, for several years, the revolutionaries entertained the hope of smuggling arms for an insurrection. In June 1916, Atul sent through Ananta Haldar a letter for Bhavabhushan Mitra at Deoghar, \\"who was one of the trusted men of the party. Both Ananta and Bhava Bhushan were dealt with under the Defence Rules and interned in Bengal.\\" (Sealy, p24). In the teeth of sporadic Police attempts to arrest them, once, in Chandernagore, while nursing Charu Ghose, Atul with the ailing co-worker on his shoulders, scaled the hospital wall. Dr Govindin, the Civil Surgeon, narrated this to Bhupendrakumar Datta. According to Nixon: \\"Jatin Mukherjee had at this time gone to Balasore, and Atul Ghosh was a big figure in the arrangement for these outrages.\\" In July 1916, \\"Atul Ghosh was still the prompting spirit of all these gangs, and in the Barisal party, too, he seems to have wielded some influence.\\".Terrorism, Vol. II, p610 ==The last phase== After the end of the War, Surendranath Banerjee, followed by Barin Ghose and Motilal Roy, successfully negotiated the withdrawal of warrants against the fugitives accused of the Indo-German plot. Atul was adamant in obtaining a promise on these points : (a) there would be no question of surrendering arms; (b) no questions would be raised on their past activities; (c) no parole would be demanded concerning their future conducts. Atul came out in 1921. But his Dada's (Jatin Mukherjee's) heroic death, \\"had knocked out his revolutionary ardour and he gave up active politics.\\" Yet, in January 1924, when Gopinath Saha killed an Englishman, mistaking him to be Tegart, the much-hated Commissioner of Kolkata Police (reputed to have shot Jatin Mukherjee dead), Atul was made a state-prisoner, to be released in 1926. The same year he married Menokarani Rakshit of Majilpur and took to business, dissociating himself completely from politics. They had no issues. In an interview with Prithwindra Mukherjee (Bagha Jatin's grandson), on 27 October 1963 - shortly before his death -, Atul sighed: \\"Dada was a magnet; we all, iron scraps, received our energy from him. When he was no more, we all became iron scraps. I still do not know whether my first allegiance went to Dada, or to the Motherland.\\" Asked about the source of Jatindranath's tremendous force, Atul replied: \\"He was a very well trained wrestler and an all-round sportsman. But what characterised him was his soul force and his power of concentration. He could pin-point all his energy to a single part of his body, for instance his fist. A single blow from that fist was equivalent to an electric charge of God knows how many volts!\\"jatindranath Atul died peacefully in his Kolkata residence, on 4 May 1966. ==A tribute== Bhupendrakumar Datta, his young associate, recalled: \\"Instinctively liberal in idea, Atulkrishna hated caste and religious distinction. Democracy in the political sphere and justice in the social sphere were what he cherished most. During the last years he turned to spiritual life.\\"DNB, Vol. II, p37 ==ReferencesBibliography== *Biplabi atulkrishna ghosh, by Bhupendrakumar Datta, Shri Sarasvati Library, Kolkata, 1966 (abbr.

He was appointed Governor and Comandante General pro tem of Alta California from 1846 to 1847, and defended California against the Americans during the Mexican–American War. ==Mexican–American War== Captain José María Flores arrived in California in 1842. He was a secretary for Governor Manuel Micheltorena. He was a captain in Comandante General José Castro's military army. In August, 1846, Castro sent Flores to deliver a message to Stockton stating that Castro was willing to accede to the wishes of the United States. Stockton did not recognize Castro’s authority and rejected it. Castro, seeing no alternative, fled California. Governor Pío Pico followed shortly thereafter. Flores and other military officers were left behind in Los Angeles. Stockton placed Lieutenant Archibald H. Gillespie in charge of Los Angeles. Gillespie exerted tyrannical control of the populace. Californios, upset by Gillespie’s iron grip, assembled a force to retake Los Angeles. Captain José María Flores, one of the officers, was chosen to act as comandante general. Captain José Antonio Carrillo was made second in command, while Captain Andrés Pico, as comandante de escuadrón, ranked third. Battle of Chino Flores's troops outnumbered Gillespie's. Flores demanded that the Americans leave. In September, 1846, Gillespie agreed to leave Los Angeles. Gillespie sent for Benjamin Wilson in the San Bernardino area to bring a force of American sympathizers to aid in securing Los Angeles. Word reached José del Carmen Lugo that Wilson was looking for Lugo in order to arrest him. Lugo put together a Californio militia and went after Wilson. The two forces met at the Battle of Chino. Afterward Lugo took forty prisoners and turned them over to Flores. Flores asked Lugo to join forces with him, but Lugo declined. Flores wanted to send the prisoners to Mexico City, but many people opposed the idea. Benjamin Wilson sent a message to Gillespie asking him to leave California completely. On October 4, 1846 Gillespie left San Pedro. A few Chino prisoners were exchanged for Californio prisoners. Flores began reclaiming California. Flores dispatched Manuel Garfias to retake Santa Barbara. Garfias accomplished his mission without a fight. Manuel Castro was sent to secure the north. He occupied San Luis Obispo. Francisco Rico was sent south to retake San Diego. He did not make it there, because he was recalled back to Los Angeles. Rico sent a few Californios to watch over San Diego and to keep the Americans at bay. Flores now had control of California from Santa Luis Obispo to San Diego, but his army had few arms and little ammunition. All male inhabitants of Southern California were asked to become soldiers. However, only about 200 men were kept in active service. On October 6, 1846, 420 Americans, including 203 United States Marines, led by Captain William Mervine landed at San Pedro. Flores dispatched José Antonio Carrillo with fifty Californio Lancers to meet the advancing American forces, while remaining regular military forces remained to secure Los Angeles. Battle of Dominguez Rancho On October 7, 1846, the American forces advanced to the Spanish adobe buildings of the Dominguez Rancho. Flores and some of his troops joined Carrillo's forces, mostly local Californio cattle ranchers, to engage Mervine's forces. On October 8 they defeated the marines in a one-hour battle, killing four while suffering zero casualties, and driving the Americans back to San Pedro Bay. This was the Battle of Dominguez Rancho, and in history, one of the few times US Marines have ever been defeated in battle. This victory was also a high-water mark for the Californios' control of their territory. Comandante general On October 26, 1846 Flores called the Departmental Assembly of California into session and reorganized the remaining California government. On November 1 Flores became the temporary governor and comandante general. On December 3, Francisco Rico and José Antonio Carrillo revolted against Flores. Flores was placed under arrest for his alleged scheme against the Chino prisoners and for allegedly stealing war funds. Flores decided not to send the Chino prisoners to Mexico City and no evidence was found in regards to the missing funds. On December 5 he was restored to power. Rico and Carrillo were jailed for the revolt, but released shortly afterward. Battle of San Pasqual Flores needed help from the national Mexican government. He sent Captain Antonio Coronel and a few men to Sonora to get reinforcements. En route the men learned of General Stephen W. Kearny’s advance. A messenger was sent to Flores. Flores sent Andrés Pico to encounter the Americans. The Battle of San Pasqual soon followed. After the victorious battle, Flores requested that Pico return to Los Angeles, but to leave men in the south to watch the American movements. After the battle a few Californios were killed at the Pauma Massacre. Flores sent José del Carmen Lugo and his militia to Temecula to avenge the killings. The Temecula Massacre soon followed. By January 4, 1847 Stockton and Kearny had joined forces (totalling 660 men) and were marching towards the Los Angeles area. In the north, John Charles Fremont was advancing with 320 men south towards Los Angeles. Flores sent messengers requesting a truce lasting until eventual word from Mexico City about an end to the war. It was a delay tactic. Stockton refused. He requested unconditional surrender. He stated that all would be given amnesty except Flores, who would be shot or taken prisoner. Battle of Rio San Gabriel On January 8, 1847 Stockton's army encountered Flores's Californios at the Battle of Rio San Gabriel. The Americans won a hard fought battle and Flores regrouped. Battle of La Mesa On January 9, 1847 Flores's troops encountered Stockton’s forces one last time at the Battle of La Mesa. By January 12, Flores's troops offered a flag of truce. On January 10, 1847, Flores left Los Angeles and stayed at Los Verdugos. He held a final council, in which he decided to leave California. He transferred command to Andrés Pico and departed that night, the 11th, for Sonora. Before leaving Los Angeles he released all of the prisoners. ==References== * * Category:Californios Category:Governors of Mexican California Category:Mexican military personnel of the Mexican–American War Category:People of the Conquest of California Category:1818 births Category:1866 deaths Category:19th-century Mexican people Category:19th-century American politicians ","title":"José María Flores"},{"id":"5559590","text":"North Wootton is a village, civil parish and electoral ward near the town of King's Lynn in Norfolk, England.

For the purposes of local government, it falls within the district of King's Lynn and West Norfolk. It is close to the Norfolk coast and is slightly smaller than the nearby South Wootton. North Wootton is near the village of Castle Rising and both were owned by the Howard family who are patrons of both parish churches. Former marshland links the village to the coast. Predominantly a farming village, the village is now experiencing a period of growth owing to new developments, holiday retreats for Londoners being the most recent of these. The old part is located around the small village green consisting of a few houses, an old schoolhouse and a former post office (now closed). With the arrival of the railway, a station (now disused) was built in the west of the village towards the marsh. The railway linked King's Lynn with Hunstanton. The old station waiting room is still extant though now part of a private house. The signal box was used by the local scout group for many years, but has now been removed for future use on a heritage railway outside the local area. The station would have been familiar to the Royal family being only away across the River Babingley from Wolferton station which served the nearby Sandringham Estate. The old Red Cat Hotel still stands. It is in the heart of North Wootton near the old railway. The Red Cat hotel is a traditional Norfolk Inn. West Norfolk Rugby Club is based there and was founded in 1925 around the time when there were only a small selection of clubs in Norfolk. The club itself was originally based in Swaffham but was later moved during the early 1930s to the Dukes Head in King’s Lynn until WW2. At the end of the war the club reformed and moved to North Wootton where it used the stables at the Red Cat hotel for changing facilities.

A fossil catfish has been identified as Hoplosternum sp. from the middle Miocene in the La Venta formation, Magdalena River basin, Colombia. ==Taxonomy== The name Hoplosternum is derived from the Greek hoplon (weapon) and sternon (chest). == Species == There are currently three described species in this genus: * Hoplosternum littorale (Hancock, 1828) (Atipa) * Hoplosternum magdalenae C. H. Eigenmann, 1913 (Striped hoplo) * Hoplosternum punctatum Meek & Hildebrand, 1916 ==Distribution== Hoplosternum species are found in tropical Central and South America especially in Guyana. It is called \\"Hassa\\" by the locals. ==Ecology== Hoplosternum is normally found in large schools on the muddy bottoms of slow- moving rivers, pools, drainage ditches, and swampy areas. In water with low oxygen content, the fish are capable of utilizing atmospheric air by taking in a gulp of air at the surface of the water and passing it back to the hind gut. The walls of the gut are lined with tiny blood vessels into which the oxygen from the air can pass, similar to the function of true lungs. The remaining gasses pass out through the anus. When there is a severe drought, these air breathers are able to traverse short stretches of land seeking better conditions. The fish is also capable of making sounds; both grunts and squeaks. Like other callichthyines, Hoplosternum species build bubble nests. Among callichthyines, H. littorale has the most complex nest structure. ==Reproduction== Hoplosternum is a builder of bubblenests from plant parts, some bottom materials, and bubbles formed by a mouth secretion and air. The male forms a mass of bubbles about 20 cm (8 in.) in diameter and 10 cm (4 in) high. During the time of construction, the female is actively chased away or ignored. When the nest construction is complete, the male will accept the female. The eggs (up to several hundred) are deposited into the nest and the male or the pair will actively protect the nest for about four weeks until the fry come out of the nest at the size of 2.5 cm (1 in). ==Cuisine== Hoplosternum is also known by the nickname \\"Hassa\\" in Guyana and other parts of South America. It is called \\"Cascadoux\\" in Trinidad and Tobago. It is normally served curried with rice or pigeon peas. ==References== * Category:Callichthyidae Category:Fish of South America Category:Freshwater fish genera Category:Catfish genera Category:Taxa named by Theodore Gill ","title":"Hoplosternum"},{"id":"5559601","text":"L.

It is a continuation of Upper Merrion Street and the place where Lower Baggot Street and Merrion Row meet. Both the latter and Hume Street link it to St Stephen's Green. ==History== Henry Loftus, 1st Earl of Ely and his wife, née Frances Monroe. The street was laid out in 1768. The first few houses on the street (2-4, the North end) are neo-Georgian and were built in the 1970s. The first house to be built on the street was Ely House (now No. 7/8). Nos. 7, 9 and 10 now stand where its garden and carriage entrance used to be. Built in 1771 by Gustavus Hume, it was occupied in 1776 by John La Touche, of the banking family. The Dublin stuccadore Michael Stapleton (1747–1801) worked this house - Stapleton's designs were for \\"Mrs. La Touche's Eating Parlour\\" and \\"Mrs. La Touche's Dining Parlour\\". It later became the residence of the Countess of Ely (Frances Monroe, wife of Henry Loftus, 1st Earl of Ely, both originally from Fermanagh). On the death of Lord Ely, Lady Ely lived here for a further 40 years. At one time it belonged to Sir William Thornley Stoker, brother of Bram Stoker, whom Oliver St. John Gogarty used to visit when he lived on the street.Brendan Lehane, The Companion Guide to Ireland, p. 17 The Knights of Saint Columbanus bought this house in 1922 and made it their headquarters.Knights of St. Columbanus Ely House, entrance to No. 7 on left, entrance to No. 8 in centre Next door, at No.6, lived the Countess of Clare (Anne Whaley, wife of Lord Chancellor of Ireland John Fitzgibbon (1749–1802), died at Ely Place), who also employed Stapleton. Both ladies were known for their grand houses and their lavish entertainments therein. Both houses are richly decorated with elaborate plasterwork. The two houses at Nos.5 and 6 were taken into Government service in 1859, when they became the Offices of the General Valuation and Boundary Survey of Ireland under Sir Richard Griffith, Bart. It was here that Sir Richard completed his magisterial work on the land and tenement valuation of Ireland, which over time became known as the \\"Griffith Valuation\\". These buildings retained their grandeur through the next century until in 1998, the Valuation Office moved away from Ely Place after a tenancy of 138 years. The building is now occupied by the advertising agency Ogilvy & Mather. A neighbour on this street was John Philpot Curran (1750–1817), the lawyer and wit who defended the United Irishmen and whose daughter became enamoured of Robert Emmet. ==Ely Place Upper== George Moore's house Ely Place Upper is a continuation on the south end of Ely Place. It consists of a terrace of five houses built in 1828. No. 3 Ely Place Upper was the residence in the 1890s of Frederick and Annie Dick, and it became the meeting place of the Theosophical Society. W. B. Yeats, Maud Gonne and George Russell were visitors. The writer George Moore lived in No. 4 at the start of the 20th century. He got into a row with his neighbours over the colour of his hall door. On the other side of the street lived the writer, surgeon and wit Oliver St. John Gogarty (1878–1957). The Royal Hibernian Academy later took over the house. ==Developments== Around 1970 the property developer Matt Gallagher intended to build a grand new gallery, to be called the \\"Gallagher Gallery\\", for the Royal Hibernian Academy. His offer was accepted with gratitude by the RHA, and work started in 1972. The academy's old headquarters, a Victorian house which had once been the property of Oliver St. John Gogarty was demolished and it was expected that the modern building, designed by Raymond McGrath, formerly Principal Architect with the OPW, would be ready for its first exhibition in 1975. RHA building Matt Gallagher died unexpectedly in January 1974. His son Patrick Gallagher inherited the business, and within a few months all work on the site stopped. For many years the building site was used as a storage yard for various Gallagher projects around the city centre. Around 2002 the old building was renovated and assumed its present shape.Frank McDonald, The Destruction of Dublin, Dublin, Gill and Macmillan, 1985. . p. 222 Many of the buildings on the street are used for offices and the Irish National Parks and Wildlife Service department have their office in this street. ==See also== *List of streets and squares in Dublin ==References== Category:Streets in Dublin (city) ","title":"Ely Place, Dublin"},{"id":"5559629","text":"\\"ID; Peace B\\" is BoA's Japanese debut single. \\"ID; Peace B\\" was originally song in Korean for her debut Korean album of the same name. ==Meaning== In an interview BoA explained \\"ID; Peace B\\" stands for her ID name, which is BoA. ==Music video== Korean music video The video starts off with BoA vocalizing, rehearsing the ID; Peace B dance and filming ID; Peace B.

Joey and Rachel are still in the bedroom and Ross knocks on their door, Rachel tells Joey to hide and turns around looking for a good spot, as Chandler opens the back door and takes Joey out of the room. Rachel turns around again and looks for Joey, not aware that the others were listening. Ross comes into the room telling Rachel what happened with Charlie, at the same time she looks for Joey in the room, wondering where he is. At the same time Joey is listening with the rest what Ross says. Once Rachel is alone again everyone goes into the bedroom and convinces Joey to tell Ross about him and Rachel. The next day, Monica goes to the salon and gets a new hairstyle, cornrows with shellfish at the tips, Chandler affirms that he can see her scalp, but Monica is really excited about the new cut and won't take them off. On the plane, Joey is worried about sitting with Charlie after breaking up and Ross offers to sit next to her, Chandler is reluctant to sit next to Monica because of her new haircut, but he does it anyway. After some teasing, Mike tells Phoebe that he had in fact been dating another girl for three months, saying that he'll break up with her that night. Rachel and Ross decide to trade seats so Ross and Joey can talk. Ross tells Joey everything about him and Charlie and Joey stays cool with it since he couldn't be mad, because he kissed Rachel. When he is about to tell Ross what happened with him and Rachel, Ross interrupts Joey saying how much of a great friend he is, that he may even think of Joey as his best friend instead of Chandler, which makes Joey excited about taking Chandler out of the equation. Ross and Rachel cross paths once more and Rachel realizes Joey didn't tell Ross, because of Ross' insinuations of having \\"dirty dreams about this\\" referring to him and Charlie, and Rachel agrees with Joey that she'll tell Ross. When they land, Monica is still excited about the cornrows, and says that she'll show everyone at work the next day. Chandler uses this opportunity to tell her that he hates the cornrows, mentioning a few comments the other friends had about it, except Joey's because he never realized Monica changed her hairstyle. At Ross' place Rachel arrives with Emma with the intention of telling Ross. But when she's about to tell him, he complains and curses that there were a few bottles of shampoo that exploded inside his bag which ruins Rachel's attempt. At Mike's place, Phoebe meets with his girlfriend, Precious (a name that Phoebe says she can't say, calling her \\"Suzie\\" instead), and tells her about Mike's proposal, convincing Precious that Mike's not worth it. The moment Mike enters the apartment Precious slaps him hoping that \\"he rots in hell\\", and leaves at once. Rachel and Joey decide who's going to try to tell Ross, but they end up kissing at the same time Ross comes into the room. ==Reception== In the original broadcast, the episode was viewed by 24.54 million viewers.

As a result, Savran will be the primary host for Penguins and Pirates pregame shows and also will continue to be the host of the Mike Tomlin Press Conference and The Mike Tomlin Show. A special 2 hour series finale of Sportsbeat aired on Monday July 13, 2009. Savran on Sportsbeat was considered a lifeline to Pittsburgh natives who had scattered throughout the country – a way to touch base and get the news and opinions regarding Pittsburgh sports. The show had a regular run of guests, including Mr. Monday Night, Former Steelers tackle Tunch Ilkin, Steelers defensive back Ike Taylor, Pittsburgh Penguins forward Max Talbot and fantasy football expert Duane Cahill. From 2001 to 2006, Savran was heard 3–6 pm weekdays on Fox Sports Radio 970, WBGG (AM). His radio show was canceled on July 7, 2006, due to a station format change.

Its mascot is the Grizzly bear. ==History== The school was founded in 1975 as a five-year high school (grades 8-12 inclusive), and was originally known as Mount Boucherie Secondary School (MBSS). The school is located at the foot of the north side of Mount Boucherie,which stands between the school and Okanagan Lake. Prior to the construction of MBSS, the sole high school on the west side of the lake was George Pringle Secondary School in Westbank. As the former orchard lands of the west side were converted into subdivisions (in particular, \\"Lakeview Heights\\") subsequent to the construction of Okanagan Lake Floating Bridge (1955) linking the west side to Kelowna by car, a growing population of students was required to travel either to Westbank, or to Kelowna Secondary School downtown. MBSS opened in 1975 and relieved the crowding at George Pringle in particular, where from 1973 classes had been divided into two \\"shifts\\" to accommodate overflow. The original school has been extensively renovated and expanded. In 1975, the buildings were organized around a central grass courtyard. They included a trades or \\"shops\\" building with woodwork, metal work, automotive mechanics, and drafting rooms; a gymnasium with a mezzanine for weights and mat training and rock climbing; a multipurpose room with a stage which opened either to the interior of the multipurpose room or to an open-air amphitheatre, a music room adjoining the gym; and a two-storey academic building containing liberal arts and humanities classrooms, library and administration on the upper floor and science laboratories on the lower. The first principal of MBSS was Cecil \\"Cec\\" Plotnikoff. The first vice-principal was Granger Evans. In the school's early years, MBSS as a new \\"single A\\" (denoting smaller size) school went through the normal development and \\"newness\\" of academic programs, team sports, and club and social activities, being measured or competing against larger and better established schools such as KSS with limited success. However, even in the mid to late 1970s there were notable achievements which ranked the school near the top of the local or provincial heap in several areas. These included the volleyball program, which was consistently competitive at a provincial level (under the guidance of Barry Kingsley), and the debating program (organized by Colin Castle) which produced top-level debaters from the school's beginnings. ==Notable alumni== *Matt Carter, CFL player *Danny Watkins, NFL player *Justin Schultz, National Hockey League (NHL) player ==References== Category:High schools in British Columbia Category:West Kelowna Category:Schools in the Okanagan Category:Educational institutions established in 1975 Category:1975 establishments in British Columbia ","title":"Mount Boucherie Senior Secondary School"},{"id":"5559699","text":"Lake City Secondary School is a public Middle school in Williams Lake in the Canadian province of British Columbia.

It is of Aarne-Thompson type 554 (\\"The Grateful Animals\\"). ==Synopsis== Two sons of a king went out to seek their fortunes, but fell into disorderly ways. The third and youngest son, Simpleton, went out to find them, but they mocked him. They traveled on, and Simpleton prevented his brothers from destroying an ant hill, killing some ducks, and suffocating a bee hive with smoke. Then they came to a castle with stone horses in the stable, and no sign of anyone. They hunted through the castle and found a room with a little gray man, who showed them to dinner. In the morning, he showed the oldest son a stone table, on which were written three tasks. Whoever performed them would free the castle. The first task was to collect the princess's thousand pearls, scattered in the woods. Whoever tried and failed would be turned to stone. Each of the older brothers tried and failed, and they were turned to stone. For the youngest, however, the ants collected the pearls. The second task was to fetch the key to the princess's bedchamber from the lake, which the ducks did for him. The third task was to pick out the youngest princess from the three sleeping princesses who looked exactly alike; the only difference was that the oldest had eaten a bit of sugar before she slept, the second a little syrup, and the youngest some honey. The queen bee picked out the youngest. This woke the castle, and restored those who had been turned to stone. The youngest son married the youngest princess, and his two brothers, the other princesses. ==Variants== The tale The Enchanted Princess by Ludwig Bechstein is quite similar to this one. Unlike in Grimm's tale there's only two brothers instead of three, called the eldest Hellmerich and the youngest Hans, who are the sons of a leather craftsman instead of a king. In the castle the person who tells them the tasks they need to accomplish to break the spell is not a dwarf but an old woman. Instead of three enchantes princesses, there's only one, that the brothers have to identify among three figures covered in veils. The other two figures are dragons working for the sorcerer that enchanted the princess Bechstein, Ludwig Deutsches Märchenbuch Leipzig: Verlag von Georg Wigand 1847 pp. 28-34.. In a literary treatment of a Languedoc variant, by Samuel Jacques Brun (How young Anglas became a Marquis, or the Story of the Ducks, the Ants, and the Flies), a young peasant named Anglas arrives in Paris after a multitude of young men that have been in the city in the past month to recover the key to the king's treasury, in exchange for marrying the princess. Anglas succeeds thanks to a duck's assistance after he promised not to hurt her ducklings.

It first aired on the NBC network in the United States on October 9, 2003. ==Plot== After Ross sees Monica's tan, which Chandler reveals she got at a tanning salon, he decides to get a spray-on tan. After hearing seemingly straightforward instructions, he gets confused and accidentally gets a double dose on the front of his body and nothing on his back. Through a series of mishaps he gets more spray tan on his front until he is incredibly dark. A visit to another tanning salon does not help remedy the issue, as the experience is even more confusing and results in a octuple dose of spray tan only on the front, which Chandler takes a photo of after tricking him into opening the door. During their first date as a couple, Rachel and Joey attempt to take their relationship to the next level but Rachel keeps accidentally slapping Joey, while Joey cannot get Rachel out of her clothes, unable to unhook her bra. After talking to Monica, who reminds her of when she first started going out with Ross and started moving past the awkwardness, Rachel decides she and Joey should power through. However, when she tries to have rough sex with him on the barcalounger, she accidentally knees him in the crotch, preventing him from performing. After talking to Chandler about their difficulties, they ask if things felt wrong when he and Monica first had sex; he affirms that they felt right and he felt it was meant to be. After reflecting on their friendship, Joey and Rachel concur their friendship is too strong for them to take things any further, and ultimately decide to stay friends. Monica and Phoebe are annoyed when an obnoxious old friend from the building, Amanda Buffamonteezi (Jennifer Coolidge), visits from England. They decide to \\"cut her\\" out, by ignoring her calls and dodging her until she leaves them alone. They first start out by not picking up the phone, which backfires when Chandler picks up the phone, resulting in Monica arranging a meeting at Central Perk. Once Amanda arrives there, she brings up memories of the time when Phoebe tried to \\"cut out\\" Monica many years before. Monica is mad at Phoebe, who reveals that it happened after they lived together: Monica was driving her crazy because of her shrillness and compulsiveness. However, Phoebe came to realize what a kind and generous person Monica is and is glad that she did not follow through with cutting her out. The two make up and decide to give Amanda another chance, but quickly leave when they see her giving Chandler a strange dance. ==Reception== In the original broadcast, the episode was viewed by 21.87 million viewers.

The line was completed in 1974 by the former Japanese National Railways (JNR) to provide faster access from the Kansai region to the Hokuriku region. It originates at Yamashina Station in Yamashina-ku, Kyoto and ends at Ōmi-Shiotsu Station in Nagahama, Shiga. Its name means \\"the line to the west of the lake,\\" indicating that it approximately parallels the western shore of Biwako. Trains continue from Yamashina to Kyoto Station on the Tōkaidō Main Line for convenient transfer to lines serving the Kansai as well as the Tōkaidō Shinkansen. In addition to local, Rapid and Special Rapid services, limited express trains such as the Thunderbird, as well as freight trains are frequently operated on the line. Some of limited express trains stop at Ōtsukyō or Katata and others skip all stations on the line. ==History== A direct Tsuruga - Kyoto line was included in the 1922 Railway Construction Act. In the meantime, the Kojaku Railway Co. opened a line from Hamaotsu on the Keihan Ishiyama Sakamoto Line 51 km to Omi- Imazu between 1923 and 1929. Between 1947 and 1965 there was a connection between Zeze on the Tokaido Main Line and Hamaotsu, allowing direct connection to the Tokaido Line. The line was purchase by JNR and closed in 1969 so the Kosei line could be constructed over parts of the alignment, with the entire new line opening in 1974 as a dual track electrified line with CTC signalling. The section from Nagahara to Ōmi-Shiotsu, originally electrified with 20 kV AC, was re-electrified to 1,500 V DC on September 24, 2006 enabling DC-only EMUs used in Osaka-Kyoto region to operate, and the Special Rapid through train service from JR Kyoto Line (Tokaido Main Line) was extended beyond Ōmi- Shiotsu to Tsuruga on the Hokuriku Main Line. ==Services and stations== Legends: *● : All trains stop *○ : Only \\"Kosei Leisure (湖西レジャー)\\" extra service makes stop at Shiga * : All trains skip Local (普通) trains stop at all stations, but they do not operate through services to the JR Kyoto Line.

The earliest peoples had migrated from northern areas of North America after leaving Siberia via the Bering Land Bridge. Artifacts and architecture demonstrate ancient complex cultures in this region. The first written records of the region were made by the Spanish conquistadors, who encountered Native American pueblos when they explored the area in the 16th century. Since that time, the Spanish Empire, Mexico, and the United States (since 1848) have claimed control of the area. The area was governed as New Mexico Territory until 1912, when it was admitted as a state. The relatively isolated state had an economy dependent on mining. Its residents and government suffered from a reputation for corruption and extreme traditionalism. New Mexico introduced the atomic age in 1945, as the first nuclear weapons were developed by the federal government in the research center it established at Los Alamos. Ethnically the state has historically included Native American, Hispanic and Anglo elements in earlier years. ==Native American settlements== Human occupation of New Mexico stretches back at least 11,000 years to the hunter-gatherer Clovis culture. Fagan, Brian M. (1987) \\"The Clovis People and Their Forebearers\\" The Great Journey: The People of Ancient America Thames and Hudson, New York, p. 177 ff., They left evidence of their campsites and stone tools. After the invention of agriculture, the land was inhabited by the Ancestral Puebloans, who built houses out of stone or adobe bricks. They experienced a Golden Age around AD 1000, but climate change led to migration and cultural evolution. From those people arose the historic Pueblo peoples who lived primarily along the few major rivers. The most important rivers are the Rio Grande, the Pecos, the Canadian, the San Juan, and the Gila. {  PREHISTORIC NEW MEXICANS - ! CULTURE OR GROUP ! TIME ! LOCATION FOUND !

By 1050 AD, they had developed planned villages composed of large terraced buildings, each with many rooms. These apartment-house villages were often constructed on defensive sites- on ledges of massive rock, on flat summits, or on steep-sided mesas, locations that would afford the Anasazi protection from their Northern enemies. The largest of these villages, Pueblo Bonito, in the Chaco Canyon of New Mexico, contained around 700 rooms in five stories and may have housed as many as 1000 persons.Nash, Gary B. Red, White and Black: The Peoples of Early North America Los Angeles 2015. Chapter 1, pg. 4 No larger apartment-house type construction would be seen on the continent until 19th century Chicago and New York. Then, around 1150, Chaco Anasazi society began to unravel. Long before the Spanish arrival, descendants of the Anasazi were using irrigation canals, check dams and hillside terracing as techniques for bringing water to what had for centuries been an arid, agriculturally marginal area. At the same time, the ceramics became more elaborate, cotton replaced yucca fiber as the main clothing material and basket weaving became more artistic.Nash, Gary B. Red, White and Black: The Peoples of Early North America Los Angeles 2015. Chapter 1, pg. 5 The Spanish encountered Pueblo civilization and elements of the Athabaskans in the 16th century. Cabeza de Vaca in 1535, one of only four survivors of the Panfilo de Narvaez expedition of 1527, tells of hearing Indians talk about fabulous cities somewhere in New Mexico. Fray Marcos de Niza enthusiastically identified these as the fabulously rich Seven Cities of Cíbola, the mythical seven cities of gold. Francisco Vásquez de Coronado led a massive expedition to find these cities in 1540–1542. Coronado camped near an excavated pueblo today preserved as Coronado National Memorial in 1541. The Spanish maltreatment of the Pueblo and Athabaskan people that started with their explorations of the upper Rio Grande valley led to hostility between the indigenous peoples and the Spanish which lasted for centuries.Herbert Eugene Bolton, Coronado: Knight of Pueblos and Plains (1949) online The three largest pueblos of New Mexico are Zuñi, Santo Domingo, and Laguna. There are three different languages spoken by the pueblos. ==Athabaskans-Apachean== The Navajo and Apache peoples are members of the large Athabaskan language family, which includes peoples in Alaska and Canada, and along the Pacific Coast. The historic peoples encountered by the Europeans did not make up unified tribes in the modern sense, as they were highly decentralized, operating in bands of a size adapted to their semi-nomadic cultures. From the 16th to the 19th centuries, the European explorers, missionaries, traders and settlers referred to the different groups of Apache and Navajo by various names, often associated with distinctions of language or geography. These Athabaskan peoples identified themselves as Diné, which means \\"the people\\". The Navajo and Apache made up the largest non-Pueblo Indian group in the Southwest. These two tribes led nomadic lifestyles and spoke the same language.R. M. Underhill, The Navahos (1956)James J. Hester, Early Navajo Migrations and Acculturation in the Southwest. (1961) online Some experts estimate that the semi-nomadic Apache were active in New Mexico in the 13th century. Spanish records indicated that they traded with the Pueblo. Various bands or tribes participated in the Southwestern Revolt against the Spanish in the 1680s. By the early 18th century the Spanish had built a series of over 25 forts to protect themselves and subjugated populations from the traditional raiding parties of the Athabaskan.Lynda A. Sanchez, Apache Legends & Lore of Southern New Mexico (2014) The Navajo Nation, with more than 300,000 citizens the largest federally recognized tribe in the United States, is concentrated in present-day northwestern New Mexico and northeastern Arizona. The Mescalero Apache live east of the Rio Grande. The Jicarilla Apache live west of the Rio Grande. The Chiricahua Apache lived in southwestern New Mexico and southeastern https://www.britannica.com/topic/Chiricahua Arizona until the late 19th century. ==Colonial period== Spanish exploration and colonization Jean Nicolas Du Tralage and Vincenzo Coronelli's 1687 map of New Mexico José Rafael Aragón, Crucifix, ca. 1795–1862, Brooklyn Museum, From about 1750, Catholic churches in Spanish New Mexico were increasingly decorated with the work of native craftspeople rather than with paintings, sculpture, and furniture imported from Europe. This small santo (saint's image) is typical of the locally produced objects. It is made of indigenous pine and painted with water-based pigments used by native artisans. Francisco Vásquez de Coronado assembled an enormous expedition at Compostela, Mexico in 1540–1542 to explore and find the mythical Seven Golden Cities of Cibola, as described by Álvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca, who had just arrived from his eight- year ordeal of survival. He traveled mostly overland from Florida to Mexico. Cabeza de Vaca and three companions were the only survivors of the Pánfilo de Narváez expedition of June 17, 1527 to Florida, losing 80 horses and several hundred explorers. These four survivors had spent eight arduous years getting to Sinaloa, Mexico on the Pacific coast and had visited many Indian tribes. Coronado and his supporters sank a fortune in this ill-fated enterprise. They took 1300 horses and mules for riding and packing, and hundreds of head of sheep and cattle as a portable food supply. Coronado's men found several adobe pueblos (towns) in 1541 but no rich cities of gold. Further widespread expeditions found no fabulous cities anywhere in the Southwest or Great Plains. A dispirited and now poor Coronado and his men began their journey back to Mexico, leaving New Mexico behind. it is likely that some of Coronado's horses escaped, to be captured and adopted for use by Plains Indians. Over the next two centuries, they made horses at the center of their nomadic cultures. Only two of Coronado's horses were mares.Haines, Francis. \\"The Northward Spread of Horses among the Plains Indians\\". American Anthropologist, Vol 40, No. 3 (1988) More than 50 years after Coronado, Juan de Oñate came north from the Valley of Mexico with 500 Spanish settlers and soldiers and 7,000 head of livestock, founding the first Spanish settlement in New Mexico on July 11, 1598.Simmons, Marc, The Last Conquistador Norman: U of OK Press, 1992, pp.96, 111 The governor named the settlement San Juan de los Caballeros. This means \\"Saint John of the Knights\\". San Juan was in a small valley. Nearby the Chama River flows into the Rio Grande. Oñate pioneered El Camino Real de Tierra Adentro, \\"The Interior Royal Road of,\\" a 700-mile (1,100 km) trail from the rest of New Spain to his remote colony. Oñate was appointed as the first governor of the new province of Santa Fe de Nuevo México. Although he Intended to achieve the total subjugation of the Natives, Oñate noted in 1599 that the Pueblo \\"live very much the same as [the Spanish] do, in houses with two and three terraces.\\" > The Native Americans at Acoma revolted against this Spanish encroachment but > faced severe suppression. In battles with the Acomas, Oñate lost 11 soldiers > and two servants, killed hundreds of Indians, and punished every man over 25 > years of age by the amputation of their left foot. The Franciscans found the > pueblo people increasingly unwilling to consent to baptism by newcomers who > continued to demand food, clothing and labor. Acoma is also known as the > oldest continually inhabited city in the United States. Oñate's capital of San Juan proved to be vulnerable to \\"Apache\\" (probably Navajo) attacks. Governor Pedro de Peralta moved the capital and established the settlement of Santa Fe in 1610 at the foot of the Sangre de Cristo Mountains.McNitt, Frank. Navajo Wars: Military Campaigns, Slave Raids, and Reprisals. Albuquerque: U of NM Press, 1972, pp. 10-11 Santa Fe is the oldest capital city in the United States. Peralta built the Palace of the Governors in 1610. Although the colony failed to prosper, some missions survived. Spanish settlers arrived at the site of Albuquerque in the mid-17th century. Missionaries attempted to convert the natives to Christianity, but had little success. Contemporary scholars believe that the objective of Spanish rule of New Mexico (and all other northern lands) was the full exploitation of the native population and resources. As Frank McNitt writes, > Governors were a greedy and rapacious lot whose single-minded interest was > to wring as much personal wealth from the province as their terms allowed. > They exploited Indian labor for transport, sold Indian slaves in New Spain, > and sold Indian products ... and other goods manufactured by Indian slave > labor.McNitt, Frank. Navajo Wars: Military Campaigns, Slave Raids, and > Reprisals. Albuquerque: U of NM Press, 1972, p. 13 The exploitative nature of Spanish rule resulted in their conducting nearly continuous raids and reprisals against the nomadic Indian tribes on the borders, especially the Apache, Navajo, and Comanche. Franciscan missionaries accompanied Oñate to New Mexico; afterward there was a continuing struggle between secular and religious authorities. Both colonists and the Franciscans depended upon Indian labor, mostly the Pueblo, and competed with each other to control a decreasing Indian population. They suffered high mortality because of infectious diseases unknowingly brought by the Spaniards, to which they had no immunity, and the exploitation that disrupted their societies. The struggle between the Franciscans and the civil government came to a head in the late 1650s. Governor Bernardo Lopez de Mendizabal and his subordinate Nicolas de Aguilar forbade the Franciscans to punish Indians or employ them without pay. They granted the Pueblo permission to practice their traditional dances and religious ceremonies. After the Franciscans protested, Lopez and Aguilar were arrested, turned over to the Inquisition, and tried in Mexico City. Thereafter, the Franciscans reigned supreme in the province. Pueblo dissatisfaction with the rule of the clerics was the main cause of the Pueblo revolt.Sanchez, Joseph P. \\"Nicolas de Aguilar and the Jurisdiction of Salinas in the Province of New Mexico, 1659-1662,\\" Revista Compultense de Historia de America Vol. 22, Servicio de Publicaciones, UCM, Madrid, 1996 The Spanish in New Mexico were never able to gain dominance over the Indian peoples, who lived among and surrounded them. The isolated colony of New Mexico was characterized by \\"elaborate webs of ethnic tension, friendship, conflict, and kinship\\" among Indian groups and Spanish colonists. Because of the weakness of New Mexico, \\"rank-and-file settlers in outlying areas had to learn to coexist with Indian neighbors without being able to keep them subordinate.\\"James F. Brooks, Captives and Cousins: Slavery, Kindship, and Community in the Southwest Borderlands. (U of North Carolina Press, 2002), p. 32 The Pueblo Indians were the first group to challenge Spanish rule significantly. Later the nomadic Indians, especially the Comanche, mounted attacks that weakened the Spanish. ==Pueblo Revolt of 1680== Many of the Pueblo people harbored hostility toward the Spanish, due to their oppression of the Indians and prohibition of their practice of traditional religion. The economies of the pueblos were disrupted, as the people were forced to labor on the encomiendas of the colonists. The Spanish introduced new farming implements which the Pueblo adopted and provided some measure of security against Navajo and Apache raiding parties. The Pueblo lived in relative peace with the Spanish from the founding of the Northern New Mexican colony in 1598.Andrew L. Knaut, The Pueblo Revolt of 1680 (1995) In the 1670s, drought swept the region, causing famine among the Pueblo, and attracting increased attacks from neighboring nomadic tribes trying to gain food supplies. Spanish soldiers were unable to defend the settlements adequately. At the same time, European-introduced diseases caused high mortality among the natives, decimating their communities. Dissatisfied with the protective powers of the Spanish crown and its god of the Catholic Church, the Pueblo returned to their old gods. This provoked a wave of repression on the part of Franciscan missionaries. Following his arrest on a charge of witchcraft and subsequent release, Popé (or Po-pay) planned and orchestrated the Pueblo Revolt. After being freed, Popé moved to Taos and planned a Pueblo war against the Spaniards. He dispatched runners to all the Pueblos carrying knotted cords, the knots signifying the number of days remaining until the appointed day for them to rise together against the Spaniards. Hearing that the Spaniards had learned of these plans, Popé ordered the attacks advanced to August 13. The Spanish were driven from all but the southern portion of New Mexico. They set up a temporary capital at El Paso while making preparations to reconquer the rest of the province.Pedro Ponce, \\"Trouble for the Spanish, the Pueblo Revolt of 1680\\" Humanities, November/December 2002, Volume 23/Number 6 The retreat of the Spaniards left New Mexico controlled by the Indians. Popé ordered the Indians, under penalty of death, to burn or destroy crosses and other Catholic religious imagery, as well as any other vestige of the Spanish culture. He also wanted to destroy Spanish livestock and fruit trees. Kivas (rooms for religious rituals) were reopened, and Popé ordered all Indians to bathe in soap made of yucca root. He forbade the planting of Spanish crops of wheat and barley. Popé ordered those Indians married by the rites of the Catholic Church to dismiss their wives, and take others under their traditional ways. He took control of the Governor's Palace as ruler of the Pueblo, and collected tribute from each Pueblo until his death in 1688. Following their success, the different Pueblo tribes, separated by hundreds of miles and six different languages, quarreled as to who would occupy Santa Fe and rule over the territory. These power struggles, combined with raids from nomadic tribes and a seven-year drought, weakened the Pueblo strength. In July 1692, Diego de Vargas led Spanish forces that surrounded Santa Fe, where he called on the Indians to surrender, promising clemency if they would swear allegiance to the King of Spain and return to the Christian faith. The Indian leaders gathered in Santa Fe, met with De Vargas, and agreed to peace.Knaut, The Pueblo Revolt of 1680 (1995) While developing Santa Fe as a trade center, the returning settlers founded Albuquerque in 1706, naming for the viceroy of New Spain, the Duke of Albuquerque. Prior to its founding, Albuquerque consisted of several haciendas and communities along the lower Rio Grande. The settlers constructed the Iglesia de San Felipe Neri (1706). Development of ranching and some farming in the 18th century were the basis for the culture of many of the state's still-flourishing Hispanics. While the Pueblo achieved a short-lived independence from the Spaniards, they gained a measure of freedom from future Spanish efforts to impose their culture and religion following the reconquest. The Spanish issued substantial land grants to each Pueblo, and appointed a public defender to protect the rights of the Indians and argue their legal cases in the Spanish courts. ==Spanish relations with nomadic Indians== From the date of the founding of New Mexico, the Pueblo Indians and Spanish settlers were plagued by hostile relationships with nomadic and semi-nomadic Navajo, Apache, Ute, and Comanche Indians.Charles F. Kenner, A History of New Mexican-Plains Indians Relations. (U of Oklahoma Press, 1969), p. 18 These tribes raided the more sedentary peoples for livestock, food supplies and stores, and captives to ransom or use as slaves. The southwestern Indians developed a horse culture, raiding Spanish ranches and missions for their horses, and ultimately breeding and raising their own herds. The Indian horse culture quickly spread throughout western America. Navajo and Apache raids for horses on Spanish and Pueblo settlements began in the 1650s or earlier.McNitt, 11 Through the Pueblo Revolt of 1680, the Indians acquired many horses. By the 1750s the Plains Indians horse culture was well established from Texas to Alberta, Canada. The Navajo, in addition to being among the first mounted Indians in the U.S., were unique in developing a pastoral culture based on sheep stolen from the Spanish. By the early 18th century, the Navajo households typically owned herds of sheep.McNitt, 23 Comancheria Comancheria prior to 1850. After the Pueblo revolt, the Comanche posed the most serious threat to the Spanish settlers. Scholar Hämäläinen (2008) argues that from the 1750s to the 1850s, the Comanche were the dominant group in the Southwest, and they ruled a domain known as Comancheria. Hämäläinen calls it an empire. Confronted with Spanish, Mexican, French, and American outposts on their periphery in New Mexico, Texas, Louisiana, and Mexico, they worked to increase their own safety, prosperity and power. The Comanche used their military power to obtain supplies and labor from the Americans, Mexicans, and Indians through cunning, tribute, and kidnappings. The Comanche empire was primarily an economic construction, rooted in an extensive commercial network that facilitated long-distance trade. Dealing with subordinate Indians, the Comanche spread their language and culture across the region. In terms of governance, the Comanche created a decentralized political system, based on a raiding, hunting and pastoral economy. They created a hierarchical social organization in which young men could advance through their success in war.Pekka Hämäläinen, The Comanche Empire (2008) p. 2 In 1706, colonists in New Mexico first recorded the Comanche; by 1719 they were raiding the colony as well as the other Indian tribes. The other tribes had primarily raided for plunder, but the Comanche introduced a new level of violence to the conflict. They preyed on other Indians. The Comanche were pure nomads, well mounted by the 1730s.\\"Frank McLynn, on The Comanche Empire by Pekka Hamalainen.\\" Literary Review. literaryreview.co.uk/mclynn_06_08.html, accessed 16 Nov 2011 They were more elusive and mobile than the semi-nomadic Apache and Navajo, who were dependent upon agriculture or herding for part of their livelihoods.Kenner, 32 The Comanche both raided and traded with the New Mexicans. They were especially prominent at the annual Taos trade fair, where they peacefully exchanged hides, meat and captive, often before or after raiding other settlements. They endangered the survival of colonial New Mexico, stripping the settlements of horses, forcing the abandonment of many settlements, and in 1778 killing 127 Spanish settlers and Pueblo Indians.Kenner, 49 Punitive expeditions by the Spanish and their Indian allies against the Comanche were usually ineffective. In 1779 a Spanish and Pueblo Indian force of 560 men, led by Juan Bautista de Anza, surprised a Comanche village near Pueblo, Colorado and killed Cuerno Verde (Green Horn), the most prominent of the Comanche war leaders.John, Elizabeth A. H. Storms Brewed in Other Men's Worlds. Lincoln: U of NE Press, 1975, pp. 584–592 The Comanche subsequently sued for peace with New Mexico, joined the New Mexicans in expedition against their common enemy, the Apache, and turned their attention to raiding Spanish settlements in Texas and northern Mexico. The New Mexicans on their part took care not to re- antagonize the Comanche and lavished gifts on them. The peace between New Mexico and the Comanche endured until the United States conquest of the province in 1846 during the Mexican–American War.John, pp. 662–676; Kenner pp. 53–77 Peace with the Comanche stimulated a growth in the population of New Mexico; settlements expanded eastward on to the Great Plains. The inhabitants of these new settlements were mostly genizaros, Indians and the descendants of Indians who had been ransomed from the Comanche.Kenner 63–64 Navajo and Apache raids continued to affect the territory. The Navajo were defeated in 1864 by Kit Carson, but the Apache leader Geronimo did not surrender until 1886. The Ute had earlier allied with the New Mexicans for mutual protection against the Comanche. The Comanche empire collapsed after their villages were repeatedly decimated by epidemics of smallpox and cholera, especially in 1849; their population plunged from about 20,000 in the 18th century to 1,500 by 1875, when they surrendered to the U.S. Government. The Comanche no longer had the manpower to deal with the U.S. Army and the wave of white settlers who encroached on their region in the decades after the Mexican–American War ended in 1848. ==U.S. exploration== Following Lewis and Clark many men started exploring and trapping in the western parts of the United States. Sent out in 1806, Lt. Zebulon Pike's orders were to find the headwaters of the Arkansas and Red rivers. He was to explore the southwestern part of the Louisiana Purchase. In 1807, when Pike and his men crossed into the San Luis Valley of northern New Mexico they were arrested and taken to Santa Fe, and then sent south to Chihuahua where they appeared before the Commandant General Salcedo. After four months of diplomatic negotiations, Pike and his men were returned to the United States, under protest, across the Red River at Natchitoches.For Zebulon Pike's route, see Gerlach, Arch C.

In 1810 catholic priest Miguel Hidalgo instigated a war for independence in central Mexico, a struggle that quickly took on the character of a class war. The following year, military captain Las Casas instigated a coup within the Imperial regime. Sympathizing with the poor underclass, Las Casas opened up a line of dialogue with the revolutionaries. This caused the Spanish elite to instigate its own counter coup and executed Las Casas. For years afterward the regime failed to regain coherency and the mandate to administer. These ideological struggles affected peripheral New Mexico much less than they did the national center, but it resulted in a sense of alienation with central authority. Furthermore, in 1818 a longstanding peace between the settled communities of New Mexico and the neighboring nomadic Indian tribes broke down. Just a month after swearing loyalty to the new Mexican government in 1821, governor Melgares led a raid into Navajo country. Isolated from other settled regions and surrounded on all sides by nomadic Indian tribes, New Mexicans developed a communal sense of peril and the need put security above all other concerns. For these reasons it is highly surprising that the transition from Spanish to Mexican rule occurred as peacefully as it did. In New Mexico the event passed with few shows of enthusiasm or partisanship. Festivals were largely a lackluster affair and held only at the behest of the revolutionary government which expressed that they should be held, \\"in all the form and with the magnificence that the oaths of allegiance to the Kings have previously been read\\". But there was no renewed civil war and the provisional government was given the grudging support of most of society. Trade along the Santa Fe Trail was opened following Mexican independence. With this trade came a new influx of citizens from the United States. Prior to independence, the estranjeros (foreigners) were not allowed to participate in receiving land grants, but now, along with the open trade, a few would become participating owners of these merceds (grants).Malcolm Ebright, Land Grants and Lawsuits in Northern New Mexico University of New Mexico Press (1994) Federalist stage In 1824 a new constitution was drafted, that established Mexico as a federalist republic. A generally liberal-minded atmosphere that had pervaded Mexico since independence led to generous grants of local autonomy and limited central power. New Mexico in particular was able to take advantage and to carve out significant privileges in this new system. Classified as a territory rather than a state, it had reduced representation in the national government but broad local autonomy. Because of the advanced age of New Mexican society and its relative sophistication, it was uniquely placed to take advantage of its position as a frontier but still effecting influence in the rest of the country. New Mexico when it belonged to Mexico in 1824 One of the defining features of the Mexican period in the history of New Mexico was the attempt to instill a nationalist sentiment. This was a tremendous challenge considering the nature of identity in Mexico during the Spanish empire. Under the official dictates of the empire, subjects were classified in terms of ethnicity, class and position in society. These legal distinctions kept groups separate, and movement between groups was regulated. Ethnic Europeans made up the upper crust of this system, with Peninsulars—those born in Spain itself—comprising the true elite, while Mexican-born Europeans, the creoles, were ranked just below them. At the bottom were the masses of Indians and Mestizos, who had few legal rights and protections against the abuse of their superiors. In contrast, the new 'Mexican' elite attempted to create a common identity among all classes and ethnicities. Embracing a wide range of peoples and cultures, from nomadic Indians to the high society of Mexico City, this ambitious undertaking met with mixed success. In New Mexico, there was already a highly structured and differentiated society at the time of independence, which was unique along the Mexican frontier. At the top were ethnic Europeans who then merged with a large community of Hispanics. The more Indian blood you possessed, the lower on the social scale you tended to reside until the bottom was made of settled Pueblo communities and the nomadic Indians who existed outside of the polity. Nationalists attempted to establish equality, if only legally, between these disparate groups. The local autonomy New Mexicans had established inhibited these endeavors and throughout the Mexican period the elite continued to maintain their privileges. Nevertheless, the inhabitants of New Mexico were able to adapt their old identity as Spanish subjects to Mexican nationals. Instead of a purely modern liberal sense of identity, this adapted Spanish feudalism to a geographic area. The evidence of this success in nationalism can be seen in the Pueblo myth of Montezuma. This held that the original Aztec homeland lay in New Mexico, and the original king of the Aztecs was a Pueblo. This creates a symbolic, and completely artificial, connection between the Mexican center and an isolated frontier society. Centralist stage and collapse The federalist and liberal atmosphere that pervaded Mexican thought since independence fell apart in the mid-1830s. Across the political spectrum there was the perception that the previous system had failed and needed readjustment. This led to the dissolution of the 1824 constitution and the drafting of a new one based on centralist lines. As Mexico drifted farther and farther toward despotism, the national project began to fail and the nation fell into a crisis. Along the frontier, formerly autonomous societies reacted aggressively to a newly assertive central government. The most independent province, Texas, declared its independence in 1835, triggering the sequence of events that led directly to Mexico's collapse. The Revolt of 1837 in New Mexico itself overthrew and executed the centrally appointed governor and demanded increased regional authority. This revolt was defeated within New Mexican society itself by Manuel Armijo. This was motivated not by nationalist sentiment but by the class antagonism within New Mexican society. When central rule was reestablished, it was done so on Armijo's lines (he became governor) and he ruled the province with even greater autonomy than any other time during the Mexican period. As the situation within central Mexico fell further and further into confusion, New Mexico began to draw closer economically to the United States. This was epitomized in the growth in traffic and prominence of the Santa Fe Trail as a means of communication and trade. In the mid-1830s New Mexico began to function as a trading hub between the United States, central Mexico and Mexican California. Merchants making their way over the Great Plains would stop in Santa Fe, where they would meet with their counterparts from Los Angeles and Mexico City. The result was that as central Mexico fell into turmoil, New Mexico grew economically and trade ties strengthened with the United States. In 1845 the governorship of Armijo was interrupted when the regime of Antonio López de Santa Anna replaced him as governor with political outsider Mariano Martínez de Lejanza. In the growing threat of war with the United States, the national center sought to bring the frontier under tight control as it is there that any war would be fought. Most New Mexicans distrusted the central government by now but that soon turned to fury when, one year into his reign, Martinez sparked a needless war with a neighboring Indian tribe out of incompetence and naïveté. To prevent revolution, Martinez was swiftly removed and Armijo reinstated, but any confidence the central government still enjoyed was completely destroyed. The following year rumors arrived in New Mexico that the Mexican government was planning on selling the territory to the United States. There was so little trust in the central government by this point that instead of investigating these rumors (which were completely false) leading members of New Mexican society drafted a threat of secession to the government. This stated that if any such actions were taken then New Mexico would declare independence as La República Mexicana del Norte. It was not until invading American troops reached New Mexico in August 1846 that they learned of war with the United States. Texas The Republic of Texas seceded from Mexico in 1836 and claimed but never controlled territory as far south and west as the Rio Grande. While most of the northwestern territory was then the Comancheria, it would have included Santa Fe and divided New Mexico. The only attempt to realize the claim was Texian President Mirabeau Lamar's Santa Fe Expedition, which failed spectacularly. The wagon train, supplied for a journey of about half the actual distance between Austin and Santa Fe, followed the wrong river, back-tracked, and arrived in New Mexico to find the Mexican governor restored and hostile. Surrendering peaceably upon a pledge to be allowed to return the way they came, the Texians found themselves bound at gunpoint and their execution put to a vote of the garrison. By one vote, they were spared and marched south to Chihuahua and then Mexico City. ==United States control== Tierra O Muerte – Land or Death. Some New Mexicans express dissatisfaction over land grant issues which date back to the Mexican War. Mexican–American War In 1846, during the Mexican–American War, American General Stephen W. Kearny marched down the Santa Fe Trail and entered Santa Fe without opposition to establish a joint civil and military government. Kearny's invasion force consisted of his army of 300 cavalry men of the First Dragoons, about 1600 Missouri volunteers in the First and Second Regiments of Fort Leavenworth, Missouri Mounted Cavalry, and the 500 man Mormon Battalion. Kearny appointed Charles Bent, a Santa Fe trail trader living in Taos, as acting civil governor. He then divided his forces into four commands: one, under Colonel Sterling Price, appointed military governor, was to occupy and maintain order in New Mexico with his approximately 800 men; a second group under Colonel Alexander William Doniphan, with a little over 800 men was ordered to capture El Paso, in the state of Chihuahua, Mexico and then join up with General Wool;Joseph G. Dawson III, Doniphan's Epic March, The 1st Missouri Volunteers in the Mexican War the third, of about 300 dragoons mounted on mules, Kearny led under his command to California. The Mormon Battalion, mostly marching on foot under Lt. Col. Philip St. George Cooke, was directed to follow Kearny with wagons to establish a new southern route to California. Gen. Kearny's annexation of New Mexico, August 15, 1846 When Kearny encountered Kit Carson, traveling East and bearing messages that California had already been subdued, he sent nearly 200 of his dragoons back to New Mexico. In California about 400 men of the California Battalion under John C. Fremont and another 400 men under Commodore Robert Stockton of the U.S. Navy and Marines had taken control of the approximately 7,000 Californios from San Diego to Sacramento. New Mexico territory, which then included present-day Arizona, was under undisputed United States control, but the exact boundary with Texas was uncertain. Texas initially claimed all land North of the Rio Grande; but later agreed to the present boundaries. Kearny protected citizens in the new US territories under a form of martial law called the Kearny Code; it was essentially Kearny and the U.S. Army's promise that the US would respect existing religious and legal claims, and maintain law and order. The Kearny Code became one of the bases of New Mexico's legal code during its territorial period, which was one of the longest in United States history. Many of the provisions remain substantially unchanged today. Kearny's arrival in New Mexico was almost without conflict; the governor surrendered without battle. The Mexican authorities took the money they could find and retreated south into Mexico. Nonetheless the U.S. occupation was resented by the New Mexicans. Provisional governor Charles Bent, a longtime resident of New Mexico, implored U.S. army officers to \\"respect the rights of the inhabitants\\" and predicted \\"serious consequences\\" if measures were not taken to prevent abuses.Lavender, David. Bent's Fort. Garden City, NY: Doubleday and Company, p. 273 His warning was prophetic, as New Mexican and Pueblo Indian rebels were soon to begin the Taos Revolt. On January 19, 1847 rebels attacked and killed acting Governor Bent and about ten other American officials. The wives of Bent and Kit Carson, however, managed to escape. Reacting quickly, a U.S. detachment under Colonel Sterling Price marched on Taos and attacked. The rebels retreated to a thick-walled adobe church. U.S. forces breached a wall and directed concentrated cannon fire into the church. About 150 of the rebels were killed, and 400 captured, following close fighting. During one trial, six rebels were arraigned and tried, of whom five were convicted of murder and one of treason. All six were hanged in April, 1847. A young traveler and later author, Lewis Hector Garrard, wrote the only eyewitness account of this trial and hanging. He criticized, \\"It certainly did appear to be a great assumption on the part of the Americans to conquer a country, and then arraign the revolting inhabitants for treason ... Treason, indeed! What did the poor devil know about his new allegiance? But so it was; and, as the jail was overstocked with others awaiting trial, it was deemed expedient to hasten the execution ... I left the room, sick at heart. Justice! out upon the word, when its distorted meaning is the warrant for murdering those who defend to the last their country and their homes.\\"Garrard, Lewis H.Wah-to-yah and the Taos Trail. H. W. Derby & Co., A. S. Barnes & Co. (1850) p. 197–198 Additional executions followed to total at least 28. Price fought three more engagements with the rebels, which included many Pueblo Indians, who wanted to push the Americans from the territory. By mid-February he had the revolt well under control. President James K. Polk promoted Price to a brevet rank of Brigadier General for his service. Total fatalities amounted to more than 300 New Mexican native rebels and about 30 Anglos, as non-Latino whites are commonly called in the southwest to this day. Provisional government Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo Under the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo of 1848, Mexico ceded much of its mostly unsettled northern holdings, today known as the American Southwest and California, to the United States of America in exchange for an end to hostilities, and the American evacuation of Mexico City and many other areas under its control. Under this treaty, Mexico recognized Texas as a part of the United States. Mexico also received $15 million cash, plus the assumption of slightly more than $3 million in outstanding Mexican debts. New Mexico, the new name for the region between Texas and California, became a US territory. The Senate struck out Article X of the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, which said that vast land grants in New Mexico (nearly always gifts by the local authorities to their friends) would all be recognized. The treaty promised to protect the ownership rights of the heirs of the land grants. The decision to strike down Article X eventually led to court cases in which the US removed millions of acres of land, timber, and water from Mexican-issued land grants and placed them back in the public domain.Richard Griswold del Castillo, The Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo: A Legacy of Conflict (1992) But, Correia points out that the lands involved had typically never been occupied or controlled by the men who had the grants; most were in Indian-controlled areas.David Correia, Properties of Violence: Law and Land Grant Struggle in Northern New Mexico (2013) The residents could choose whether they remain and receive United States citizenship or remove to Mexico and retain (or gain) Mexican citizenship. All but 1000 or so settlers—who were mostly Mexican government officials—chose American citizenship, which included full voting rights.Linda C. Noel, \\"'I am an American': Anglos, Mexicans, Nativos, and the National Debate over Arizona and New Mexico Statehood,\\" Pacific Historical Review, (Aug 2011) 80#3 pp 430-467, at p 436 Because at the time only white men could vote in most states, the Mexicans were considered white under the law. In later decades, as discrimination by whites increased in numerous areas in relation to growth in the number of Mexican immigrants, some states tried to classify Hispanics as black or colored, and thus exclude them from voting because of barriers to voter registration. These practices were challenged in the mid-20th century and resolved in a case that reached the US Supreme Court. American Territory Proposals for Texas northwestern boundary New Mexico proposed boundary before Compromise of 1850The Congressional Compromise of 1850 halted a bid for statehood under a proposed antislavery constitution. Texas transferred eastern New Mexico to the federal government, settling a lengthy boundary dispute. Under the compromise, the American government established the New Mexico Territory on September 9, 1850. The territory, which included all of Arizona, New Mexico and parts of Colorado, officially established its capital at Santa Fe in 1851. The U.S. territorial New Mexico census of 1850 found 61,547 people living in all the territory of New Mexico. The people of New Mexico would determine whether to permit slavery under a proposed constitution at statehood, but the status of slavery during the territorial period provoked considerable debate. The granting of statehood was up to a Congress sharply divided on the slavery issue. Some (including Stephen A. Douglas) maintained that the territory could not restrict slavery, as under the earlier Missouri Compromise, while others (including Abraham Lincoln) insisted that older Mexican legal traditions, which forbade slavery, took precedence. Regardless of its official status, black slavery was rarely seen in New Mexico although Indian slavery was common. Statehood was finally granted to New Mexico on January 6, 1912. Navajo and Apache raids and plundering led Kit Carson to abandon his intent to retire to a sheep ranch near Taos after the Mexican–American War. Carson accepted an 1853 appointment as U.S. Indian agent with a headquarters at Taos, and fought the Indians with notable success. The United States acquired the southwestern boot heel of the state and southern Arizona below the Gila river in the mostly desert Gadsden Purchase of 1853. This purchase was desired when it was found that a much easier route for a proposed transcontinental railroad was located slightly south of the Gila river. This territory had not been explored or mapped when the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo was negotiated in 1848. The ever-present Santa Anna was in power again in 1853 and needed the money from the Gadsden Purchase to fill his coffers and to pay the Mexican Army for that year. The Southern Pacific built the second transcontinental railroad though this purchased land in 1881. In the United States House of Representatives the Committee of Thirty-Three on January 14, 1861 reported that it had reached majority agreement on a constitutional amendment to protect slavery where it existed and the immediate admission of New Mexico Territory as a slave state. This latter proposal would result in a de facto extension of the Missouri Compromise line for all existing territories below the line.Klein, Maury. Days of Defiance: Sumter, Secession, and the Coming of the Civil War. (1997) . pg.405-410 After the Peace Conference of 1861, a bill for New Mexico statehood was tabled by a vote of 115 to 71 with opposition coming from both Southerners and Republicans. Media The first newspaper in New Mexico was El Crepusculo de la Libertad (\\"The Dawn of Liberty\\"), a Spanish-language paper founded in 1834 at Taos. The Santa Fe Republican, founded in 1847, was the first English-language newspaper. By 2000 the state had 18 daily newspapers, 13 Sunday newspapers, and 25 weekly newspapers. Today's daily papers include the Albuquerque Journal, the Santa Fe New Mexican (founded in 1849), the Las Cruces Sun-News, the Roswell Record, the Farmington Daily Times, and the Deming Headlight. The most widely broadcast radio station since its founding in 1922 has been KKOB (AM) in Albuquerque. With 50,000 watts of transmitter power on a clear channel it reaches audiences in most of New Mexico and parts of neighboring states.Paul L. Hain et al., New Mexico Government (1994) p. 257 There are at least five television stations, based in Albuquerque, representing ABC, NBC, CBS, PBS, and Fox. Civil War During the American Civil War, Confederate troops from Texas commanded by Gen. Henry Sibley briefly occupied southern New Mexico in July 1861, pushing up the Rio Grande valley as far as Santa Fe by February 1862. Defeated in the Battle of Glorieta Pass, they were forced to withdraw south. Union troops from California under Gen. James Carleton re-captured the territory in August 1862. As Union troops were withdrawn to fight elsewhere, Kit Carson helped to organize and command the 1st New Mexican Volunteers to engage in campaigns against the Apache, Navajo, and Comanche in New Mexico and Texas as well as participating in the Battle of Valverde against the Confederates. Confederate troops withdrew after the Battle of Glorieta Pass where Union regulars, Colorado Volunteers (The Pikes Peakers), and New Mexican Volunteers defeated them. The Arizona Territory was split off as a separate territory in 1863. 1867 map Indians Centuries of continued conflict with the Apache and the Navajo continued to plague New Mexico. In 1864, the U.S. Army trapped and captured the main Navajo forces, forcing them onto a small reservation in eastern New Mexico in what is called the Long Walk of the Navajo, also called the Long Walk to Bosque Redondo. This put an end to their livestock raids on New Mexican farms, ranches, and Indian pueblos. After several years of severe hardships, during which many Navajos died, they were allowed in 1868 to return to most of their lands. Sporadic Apache small-scale raiding continued until Apache chief Geronimo finally was captured and imprisoned in 1886.Thompson, Gerald Thompson, The Army and the Navajo: The Bosque Redondo Reservation Experiment 1863–1868 (1976) After the Civil War, the Army set up a chain of forts to protect the people and the caravans of commerce. Most tribes were relocated on reservations near the forts, where they were given food and supplies by the federal government. Often supplies and annuities were late, or food spoiled. The new legal system and the legal profession In the first half of the 19th century, Mexico set up a judicial system for its northernmost districts, in present-day New Mexico and California. There were no professionally trained lawyers or judges. Instead, there were numerous low- ranking legal roles such as notario, escribano, asesor, auditor de Querra, justicia mayor, procurador, and juez receptor. With the annexation by the United States in 1848, Congress set up an entirely new territorial legal systems, one that used the English language and American laws, forms, and procedures. Practically all the lawyers and judges were new arrivals from the United States, as there was no place in the new system for the old Hispanic roles.Joseph Webb McKnight, \\"Law Without Lawyers on the Hispano-Mexican Frontier\\" West Texas Historical Association (1990), Vol. 66, pp 51-65. Elfego Baca (1865 – 1945) was an outlaw-turned-lawman, lawyer, and politician in New Mexico in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. In 1888, after serving as a County Sheriff, Baca became a U.S. Marshal. He served for two years and then began studying law. In December 1894, he was admitted to the bar and practice law in New Mexico until 1904. he held numerous local political offices, and when New Mexico became a state in 1912, he was the unsuccessful Republican candidate for Congress. In the late 1950s, Walt Disney turned Baca into the first Hispanic popular culture hero in the United States, on 10 television shows, in six comic books, in a feature film, and in related merchandising. However, Disney deliberately avoided ethnic tension by presenting Baca as a generalized Western hero, portraying a standard hero similar to Davy Crockett, in Hispanic dress.Ferenc Morton Szasz, \\"A New Mexican\\" Davy Crockett\\": Walt Disney's version of the Life and Legend of Elfego Baca.\\" Journal of the Southwest (2006) 48#3: 261-274. excerpt Las Gorras Blancas After the Mexican–American War, Anglo Americans began migrating in large numbers to all of the newly acquired territory. Anglos began taking lands from both Native Americans and Nuevomexicanos by different means, most notably by squatting. Squatters often then sold these lands to land speculators for huge profits, especially after the passage of the 1862 Homestead Act encouraging development in the West. Nuevomexicanos demanded the return of their lands, but the governments did not respond favorably. For example, the Surveyor of General Claims Office on New Mexico would at times take up to fifty years to process a claim, meanwhile, the lands were being grabbed up by the newcomers. The first Surveyor General, William Pelham, had two translators assisting him: David Miller and David Whiting. But these two men seemingly did not cut into the fifty years needed to translate. While the Santa Fe, Atchison, and Topeka railroad was built in the 1890s, speculators known as the Santa Fe Ring, orchestrated schemes to dislodge natives from their lands. In response, Nuevomexicanos gathered to reclaim lands taken by Anglos.Rosales, F. Arturo. Chicano: The History of the Mexican American Civil Rights Movement (Houston, TX: Arte Publico Press, 1997) p. 7-9 Hoping to scare off the new immigrants, they eventually used intimidation and raids to accomplish their goals. They sought to develop a class-based consciousness among local people through the everyday tactics of resistance to the economic and social order confronting common property land grant communities. They called themselves Las Gorras Blancas, a name referring to the white head coverings many wore. Gilded Age Bronze statue of Archbishop Lamy in front of St. Francis Cathedral In 1851 the Vatican appointed Jean-Baptiste Lamy (1814–1888), a French cleric, as bishop of the diocese of Sante Fe. There were only nine priests at first; Lamy brought in many more. In 1875 it was upgraded to the status of archdiocese, with supervision over Catholic affairs in New Mexico and Arizona. Lamy had St. Francis Cathedral built in a French style; the work was conducted between 1869 and 1886.Paul Horgan, Lamy of Santa Fe (2003) To provide the forts and reservations with food, the federal government contracted for thousands of head of cattle, and Texas cattlemen began entering New Mexico with their herds. Rancher Charles Goodnight blazed the first cattle trail through New Mexico in 1866, extending from the Pecos River northward into Colorado and Wyoming. Over it more than 250,000 head of cattle trailed to market. John Chisum also brought his herds up the Pecos. As employer of the desperado Billy the Kid, he figured prominently in the Lincoln County War of 1878–1880. This was one of the many struggles between cattle herders and territorial officials, among rival cattle barons, and between sheep ranchers and cattle ranchers during this period. The Butterfield Trail, the longest of the cattle trails, had its first important stop in New Mexico at Fort Fillmore. It began operations in 1858 and was superseded by railroad operations in 1881. The Santa Fe Railroad reached New Mexico in 1878, with the first locomotive crossing Raton Pass that December. It reached Lamy, New Mexico, 16 miles (26 km) from Santa Fe in 1879 and Santa Fe itself in 1880, and Deming in 1881, thereby replacing the storied Santa Fe Trail as a way to ship cattle to market. The new town of Albuquerque, platted in 1880 as the Santa Fe Railroad extended westward, quickly enveloped the old town. The rival Southern Pacific was completed between the Rio Grande valley and the Arizona border in 1881. From 1880 to 1910 the territory grew rapidly. With the coming of the railroad, many homesteaders moved to New Mexico. In 1886 the New Mexico Education Association of school teachers was organized; in 1889 small state colleges were established at Albuquerque, Las Cruces, and Socorro; and in 1891 the first effective public school law was passed. An irrigation project in the Pecos River valley in 1889 marked the first of many such projects to irrigate farms in the dry state. Discovery of artesian waters at Roswell in 1890 gave both farming and mining a boost. The power of the cattle barons faded as much land was fenced in at the expense of the open range. The cattle ranchers and sheep ranchers also learned to tolerate one other, and both the cattle and sheep industries expanded. Mining became even more important, especially gold and silver. Coal mining developed during the 1890s, primarily to supply the railroads, and oil was discovered in Eddy County in 1909. The population of New Mexico reached 195,000 in 1910. Conflicting land claims led to bitter quarrels among the original Spanish inhabitants, cattle ranchers, and newer homesteaders. Despite destructive overgrazing, ranching survived as a mainstay of the New Mexican economy. ==Statehood== On January 6, 1912, after years of debate on whether the population of New Mexico was fully assimilated into American culture, or too immersed in corruption, President William Howard Taft twisted arms in Congress and it approved admission of New Mexico as the 47th state of the Union.David V. Holtby, Forty-Seventh Star: New Mexico's Struggle for Statehood (2013) The admission of neighboring Arizona on February 14, 1912 completed the contiguous 48 states. Thousands of Mexicans fled north during the extremely bloody civil war that broke out in Mexico in 1911. In 1916 Mexican military leader Pancho Villa led an invasion across the border into Columbus, New Mexico, where they burned some homes and killed several Americans. New Mexico contributed some 17,000 men to the armed services during World War I. Thousands more from the state fought for the Allies during World War II. Artists and writers When the mainline of the railroad bypassed Santa Fe, the city lost businesses and population. In the 20th century, American and British artists and writers, and retirees were attracted to the cultural richness of the area, the beauty of the landscapes, and dry warm climate. Local leaders took the opportunity to promote the city's heritage making it a tourist attraction. The city sponsored bold architectural restoration projects and erected new buildings according to traditional techniques and styles, thus creating the \\"Santa Fe style.\\" Edgar L. Hewett, founder and first director of the School of American Research and the Museum of New Mexico in Santa Fe, was a leading promoter. He began the Santa Fe Fiesta in 1919 and the Southwest Indian Fair in 1922 (now known as the Indian Market). When he tried to attract a summer program for Texas women, many artists rebelled saying the city should not promote artificial tourism at the expense of its artistic culture. The writers and artists formed the Old Santa Fe Association and defeated the plan. The old \\"mud city\\" - which short-sighted modernizers laughed at for its adobe houses - was transformed into a city proud of its peculiarities and its blend of tradition and modernity.Carter Jones Meyer, \\"The Battle between 'Art' and 'Progress': Edgar L. Hewett and the Politics of Region in the Early-Twentieth-Century Southwest,\\" Montana: The Magazine of Western History, September 2006, Vol. 56 Issue 3, pp 47-61 Nuevomexicanos In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the Anglos tried to regulate the Hispanics living in New Mexico to second-class social status, due to xenophobia and prejudice. Some of these Anglos were ethnocentric, deprecating Hispanic/Mexican culture and disputing the rights of the original inhabitants. Richard Nostrand strongly disputes claims that this treatment caused the Hispanics to construct a \\"Spanish American\\" identity in response, in an early instance of expressing being American through ethnic identity. World War I gave the Hispanics the opportunity to demonstrate American citizenship by participating in the war effort. Like the \\"new immigrants\\" in northeastern cities, who also constructed dual identities, members of the Nuevomexicano middle class exuberantly participated in the war effort. They melded images of their heritage with patriotic symbols of America, especially in the Spanish-language press. Nuevomexicano politicians and community leaders recruited the rural masses into the war cause overseas and on the home front, including the struggle for woman suffrage. Support from New Mexico's Anglo establishment aided their efforts. Their wartime contributions improved the conditions of minority citizenship for Nuevomexicanos but did not entirely eliminate social inequality. For example, no Hispanics —not even the son of a politician— were allowed to be a member of a fraternity at the state university.Phillip Gonzales and Ann Massmann, \\"Loyalty Questioned: Nuevomexicanos in the Great War.\\" Pacific Historical Review, November 2006, Vol. 75 Issue 4, pp 629-666Phillip B.

Around 1920, the term \\"Spanish- American\\" replaced \\"Mexican\\" in polite society and in political debate. The new term served both the interests of both groups. For Spanish speakers, it evoked Spain, not Mexico, recalling images of a romantic colonial past and suggesting a future of equality in Anglo-dominated America. For Anglos, on the other hand, it was a useful term that upgraded the state's image, for the old image as a \\"Mexican\\" land suggested the violence and disorder associated with that country's civil war in the early 20th century. This had discouraged capital investment and set back the statehood campaign. The new term gave the impression that \\"Spanish Americans\\" belonged to a true \\"American\\" political culture, making the established order appear all the more democratic.Charles Montgomery, \\"Becoming 'Spanish-American': Race and Rhetoric in New Mexico Politics, 1880–1928\\", Journal of American Ethnic History, Summer 2001, Vol. 20 Issue 4, pp. 59-84; via JSTOR; accessed 18 July 2016 New arrivals Serving food in Pie Town, New Mexico, 1940 In the 20th century immigrants and migrants brought new skills, outlooks and values, modernizing the highly traditional culture of the state. They included Midwestern farmers who tried to cultivate humid-area crops to the desert climate, Texas oilmen, tuberculosis patients who sought healing in the dry air (before an appropriate antibiotic was discovered),Nancy Owen Lewis, \\"High and Dry in New Mexico: Tuberculosis and the Politics of Health,\\" New Mexico Historical Review, 87 (Spring 2012), 129–66. artists who made Taos a national cultural center, New Dealers who sought to modernize the state as fast as possible and improve infrastructure, soldiers and airmen from all over who came for training at the many military bases, noted scientists who came to Los Alamos to build a super weapon, and stayed on, and retirees from colder climes. They brought money and new ideas. The state residents gradually adopted more of a standard national culture, losing some of its unique qualities.Michael Welsh, \\"New Mexico at Seventy Five: A Historical Commentary,\\" New Mexico Historical Review, Fall 1987, Vol. 62 Issue 4, pp 387-396 The building for the State Supreme Court was constructed during the Great Depression as a WPA project, completed in 1937. It's an example of the numerous projects which the Democratic administration of President Franklin D. Roosevelt collaborated on with states in order to improve infrastructure, invest in facilities, and put people to work. Prior to that project, the Supreme Court met in the basement of the state capitol. Women's suffrage The suffrage movement in the state worked hard to get women the vote but were stymied by the conservatism of politicians and the Catholic Church. New Mexico's legislature was one of the last in 1920 to ratify the 19th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. After it passed, there was quickly a dramatic increase in political participation by both Anglo and Hispanic women, as well as strong mobilization efforts by the major parties to gain the support of the female voters.Joan Jensen, \\"Disfranchisement is a Disgrace\\": Women and Politics in New Mexico, 1900–1940,\\" New Mexico Historical Review, Winter 1981, Vol. 56 Issue 1, pp 5-35 World War II New Mexico proportionately suffered the loss of more servicemen than any other state in the nation. The state led in the national war bond drive and had fifty federal installations, including glider and bombardier training schools. The state rapidly modernized during the war, as 65,000 young men (and 700 young women) joined the services, where they received a wide range of technical training and saw the outside world, many for the first time. Federal spending brought wartime prosperity, along with high wages, jobs for everyone, rationing and shortages. Federal facilities have continued to be major contributors to the state's economy in the postwar years.Ferenc M. Szasz and George E. Webb, \\"The New Mexican Response to the End of the Second World War,\\" New Mexico Historical Review, Winter 2008, Vol. 83 Issue 1, pp 1-37 The top secret remote Los Alamos Research Center was developed in the mountains of New Mexico as a research facility, opening in 1943 for the purpose of developing the world's first atomic bomb. Teams of scientists and engineers were recruited to work on this project. The first test at Trinity Site in the desert of the Alamogordo Bombing and Gunnery Range, now known as White Sands Missile Range, 28 miles southeast of San Antonio, New Mexico, on July 16, 1945 ushered in the atomic age. New Mexico had become a center of world-class science. High-altitude balloon experiments from Holloman Air Force Base caused debris found near Roswell, New Mexico (The Roswell Incident) in 1947. This reputedly led to the persistent (but unproven) claims by a few individuals that the government had captured and concealed extraterrestrial corpses and equipment. Albuquerque expanded rapidly after the war. The state quickly emerged as a leader in nuclear, solar, and geothermal energy research and development. The Sandia National Laboratories, founded in 1949, carried out nuclear research and special weapons development at Kirtland Air Force Base south of Albuquerque and at Livermore, California. Environmentalism Since the late 19th century, New Mexico and other arid Western states have sought to assert sovereign control over water allocation policies within their boundaries. In the 1990s the legislature debated H.R. 128, the proposed State Water Sovereignty Protection Act. Since the passage of the Newlands Act in 1902, Western states have benefited from federal water projects. In spite of these projects, water allocation remained a politically charged issue throughout the 20th century. Most states have sought to limit federal control over water distribution, preferring instead to allocate water under the discredited doctrine of prior appropriation.Hana Samek Norton, \\"'Fantastical Assumptions': A Centennial Overview of Water Use in New Mexico,\\" New Mexico Historical Review, Fall 1998, Vol. 73 Issue 4, pp 371-387 As a state dependent on both smokestack industry and scenic tourism, New Mexico was at the center of the debates over clean air legislation, particularly the Clean Air Act of 1967 and its amendments in 1970 and 1977. The Kennecott Copper Corporation, which operated a large smelter at Hurley, New Mexico, generating as a byproduct thick clouds of air pollution, led the opposition to the environmentalists, represented by the New Mexico Citizens for Clean Air and Water. Eventually the company was forced to comply with fairly strict federal standards. They often delayed the compliance process for years by threatening economic repercussions, such as plant closings and unemployment, if forced to comply with standards. Christopher J.

Signaling and operation on the Washington Metro system involves train control, station identification, train signaling, signage, and train length. As with any working railroad, communication between train operators, dispatchers, station personnel and passengers is critical. Failures will result in delays, accidents, and even fatalities. It is therefore important that a comprehensive signal system operated by a central authority be in place. This gives individual train and station operators the information they need to safely and efficiently perform their tasks. == Train control == Metro was designed to use an Automatic Train Control (ATC) system, which comprises three sub-systems. Automatic Train Protection (ATP) protects trains by separating them so as to avoid collision. Automatic Train Supervision (ATS) routes trains and assists in maintaining adherence to schedule. Together, these two sub-systems provide input to the train's cab signals and to a third sub-system, Automatic Train Operation (ATO), which can control the trains directly. Since a train collision in 2009 caused by an ATC malfunction, Metro did not use the ATC system following the accident until it was temporarily re-introduced on the Red Line in September 2014 as a test program. The Automatic Train Protection sub-system uses coded track circuit technology originally supplied by Rochester, New York-based General Railway Signal when the line was constructed in the 1970s. It is a life-critical system that provides a continuous stream of information to the train regarding the maximum safe speed via the running rails. Speed commands are designed to ensure trains maintain a safe stopping distance from any obstruction and do not exceed the speed limit for any segment of track. The system stops trains in advance of any other train traffic, and before stop signals at interlockings. The cab signalling system relies on track circuits to detect track occupancy, and thus send the appropriate speed code.. Although the ATP system was designed to be fail-safe, the track circuit control equipment on which it relies has been prone to parasitic oscillations which can cause the system intermittently to fail to detect the presence of a train. This resulted in the 2009 collision, after which Metro began to operate all trains manually. In September 2014, Metro began reintroducing its computerized control system after taking a number of measures to avoid accidents similar to the 2009 accident. The Automatic Train Supervision sub-system provides for headway management and proper interleaving of trains at junctions by speeding up or slowing down trains.. The system works via a series of track mounted balises, which function as information beacons transmitting a speed code to the train as it passes overhead. Its designers intended its function to be non-vital, and for this reason, the design is not fail-safe. At no point can the ATC system override the maximum speed limit enforced by the cab signal system. Automatic Train Operation controls trains so that, between stations, they will move at the speed specified by the automatic train protection and automatic train supervision sub-systems. All Metro trains are manned by train operators who work the doors, make station announcements, and supervise the train. The train operator also can control whether the train operates in automatic mode or manual mode. From November 17, 1995 until January 6, 1996, Metro management required its employees to use the automatic mode at all times. During the Blizzard of 1996, however, there was a collision on January 6 that occurred when the ATS system failed to pick up proper instructions from the wayside communication system during a snowstorm, and defaulted to the highest speed. This speed would have been safe during dry weather, but because of ice or snow, trains required additional stopping distance, which was not provided for by the ATC system. From the June 2009 collision until 2015, Metrorail operators operated the trains exclusively in manual mode; the ATC system was restored to the Red Line in 2015. The automatic train protection system still limits the maximum speed of every train that is in revenue service. An automated announcement system is equipped on the 7000-series rolling stock and is planned to be added to the 6000-series rolling stock once rehabilitation of those train cars is complete. Non-revenue tracks (storage tracks, tail tracks, yard tracks) are not equipped with ATC. Green signs with letters reading \\"START ATC\\" and \\"END ATC\\" mark the beginning and ending respectively of ATC territory. A train services the station from the center track, due to single-tracking west of the station. == Station identification == The system's rail lines run on eleven lettered \\"routes\\". Within these routes, each station is also identified by a letter and number system based on the route letter and the station number in ascending order from the system's geographic center. This is known as the Remote Terminal Unit (RTU) number. The RTU number identifies the station and nearby track controlled by the station's wayside control room to Metro's Central Control. , , , and have two RTU numbers: one for each level. Metro's lettered routes are as follows: * A Route: Metro Center to (Red) * B Route: Metro Center to (Red) * C Route: Metro Center to via (Orange, Blue, Yellow and Silver) * D Route: Metro Center to (Orange, Blue and Silver) * E Route: Gallery Place to (Yellow and Green) * F Route: Gallery Place to (Yellow and Green) * G Route: D&G; Junction east of to (Blue and Silver) * J Route: C&J; Junction south of to (Blue) * K Route: C&K; Junction south of to (Orange and Silver) * L Route: F&L; Junction south of L'Enfant Plaza to C&L; Junction north of via Fenwick Bridge (Yellow) * N Route: K&N; Junction east of to , eventually to (Silver) There are no H, I, M, or O Routes. The originally- intended H Route ultimately became the present J Route, and \\"I\\" and \\"O\\" are not allowed to be used as route letters. The M Route would likely be assigned to a future route to Lincolnia, branching off from the C Route south of Pentagon station. == Signaling == Interlocking and signal for the D Route pocket track (D98). The D&G; junction is in the background. The track was to be used to turn Silver Line trains, however, safety concerns raised in December 2012 necessitated the Silver Line to be extended to Largo Town Center. Fixed signals are only present at interlockings, and consist of three lamps: two red and one lunar. They show a red over red aspect for \\"stop and stay,\\" a lunar (white) aspect for \\"proceed,\\" and a flashing lunar aspect for \\"proceed on diverging route\\" (only present on newer interlockings; older interlockings are being updated with signals that show this aspect). Tracks are divided into block sections, which can only be occupied by one train at a time, a method to protect against collisions used by most railway systems worldwide, but there are generally no fixed signals to protect block sections (signals tend to be only at beginning/end of route and just before track switches). Virtual signal aspects are transmitted to the train by a cab signaling system and displayed to the operator in the cab, as well as transmitted to the ATC system. Entry into an occupied block is prevented by an automatic train protection system (ATP), which supervises both manual and ATC operation and stops the train well before it would enter an occupied block. At switches entering into pocket tracks in a direction reverse to the normal operating direction, there is a \\"P Signal\\". The P Signal is a single lunar signal that displays the letter \\"P\\" and is found at the entrance to some but not all pocket tracks and other selected main line interlockings in the reverse direction of the normal flow of traffic. Below the P signal on the same post is a punch box to allow the train operator to manually set the switch to the diverting direction (reverse) when the P Signal is lit. The P signal is only lit when a train occupies the two track circuit approaching the P Signal and all possible routes into the interlocking are not occupied. Similar signals are also in place on the Baltimore Metro SubwayLink, the PATCO Speedline, and the Miami Metrorail. == Signage == Two trackside signs exist: The \\"S\\"-Sign is posted at revenue tracks and indicates to the operator that a station is ahead. It is located at a distance no greater than 1200 feet (365.75 m) before a station platform. The \\"TB\\"-Sign is posted to indicate to the operator that an eight-car train (the longest used in the system) is clear of an interlocking (\\"turnback\\") when the train front is flush with the sign, and that the train can turn back in the direction from which it came on the opposite track. == Train length == Vienna station. When it first opened, Metro ran a mix of four- and six-car trains; however, there have not been any four-car trains used in the system (except for the money train) since the mid-2000s. The most common train length is eight cars due to the fact that the 7000 series railcars can only be operated this way. During peak hours, a mix of six- and eight-car trainsets are used, while during off-peak and weekend hours almost all trains are only six cars in length. In 2008, Metro began planning to acquire sufficient quantities of the new 7000-Series cars to run 100% eight-car trains.Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority, \\"100% 8-Car Train-- Rail Cars (7000 Series),\\" Project Number 068, September 2008. Metro also tested eight-car trains on the Yellow and Blue lines in preparation for increased service during the 2009 inauguration of Barack Obama. However, by early 2010 riders began to lose faith in WMATA's \\"promise\\" to implement 100% eight-car trains.Robert Thompson, \\"Metro Riders Quickly Lose Faith in Promise for 8-Car Trains,\\" the Washington Post, January 24, 2010. In December 2010 those fears were confirmed and Metro delayed the plans indefinitely.Kytja Weir, \\"Metro: Longer, Less Crowded Trains Will Have to Wait,\\" Washington Examiner, December 5, 2010. , during peak hour service the Red Line runs 51% eight-car trains, the Orange Line runs 40%, and the Green Line runs 50%, while the Blue and Yellow Lines run only six-car trains, for a total of 43 of 129 trains running at full length, or 33%.Matt Johnson, \\"How Many Railcars Does it Take to Run Metro?\\" Greater Greater Washington, May 24, 2012. ==References== Signaling and operation ","title":"Washington Metro signaling and operation"},{"id":"5559794","text":"Bardejov District in the Prešov Region of Slovakia 7: Prešov Region Komárov (Hungarian since 1907: Felsőkomaróc) is a village and municipality in Bardejov, Prešov, Slovakia. ==History== In historical records, the village was first mentioned in 1355.

Cellulosomes are associated with the cell surface and mediate cell attachment to insoluble substrates and degrade them to soluble products which are then absorbed. Cellulosome complexes are intricate, multi-enzyme machines, produced by many cellulolytic microorganisms. They are produced by microorganisms for efficient degradation of plant cell wall polysaccharides, notably cellulose, the most abundant organic polymer on Earth. The multiple subunits of cellulosomes are composed of numerous functional domains that interact with each other and with the cellulosic substrate. One of these subunits, a large glycoprotein \\"scaffoldin\\", is a distinctive class of non-catalytic scaffolding polypeptides. The scaffoldin subunit selectively integrates the various cellulases and xylanase subunits into the cohesive complex, by combining its cohesin domains with a typical dockerin domain present on each of the subunit enzymes. The scaffoldin of some cellulosomes, an example being that of Clostridium thermocellum, contains a carbohydrate-binding module that adheres cellulose to the cellulosomal complex. == Structure == Cellulosomes exist as extracellular complexes that are either attached to the cell wall of bacteria or free in solution, where the insoluble substrate can be broken down into soluble products and taken up by the cell. The large size and heterogeneity of cellulosomes from the best-characterized organisms (i.e., C. thermocellum, C. cellulolyticum, and C. cellulovorans) have greatly complicated efforts to probe cellulosome structure and function. Other cellulosome systems (such as those from Acetivibrio cellulolyticus and Ruminococcus flavefaciens) appear to be even more intricate. The cellulosome consists of a multi-functional, integrating scaffoldin subunit, responsible for organizing the various cellulolytic subunits (e.g., the enzymes) into the complex. Within a cellulosome, multiple endoglucanases, cellobiohydrolases, xylanases and other degradative enzymes work synergistically to attack heterogeneous, insoluble cellulose substrates. This is accomplished by the interaction of two complementary classes of module, located on the two separate types of interacting subunits, i.e., a cohesin module on the scaffoldin and a dockerin module on each enzymatic subunit. The high-affinity cohesin-dockerin interaction defines the cellulosome structure. Attachment of the cellulosome to its substrate is mediated by a scaffoldin-borne cellulose-binding module (CBM) that comprises part of the scaffoldin subunit. Much of our understanding of its catalytic components, architecture, and mechanisms of attachment to the bacterial cell and to cellulose, has been derived from the study of Clostridium thermocellum.Bayer EA, Belaich JP, Shoham Y, and Lamed R.

PubMed ID:15197390 ==History of discovery== In the early 1980s, Raphael Lamed and Ed Bayer met at Tel Aviv University, Israel and commenced their work that led to the discovery of the cellulosome concept. At the time, they weren’t looking for enzymes or cellulosomes at all. They simply sought a ‘cellulose-binding factor’ or ‘CBF’ on the cell surface of the anaerobic thermophilic bacterium, C. thermocellum, which they inferred would account for the observation that the bacterium attaches strongly to the insoluble cellulose substrate prior to its degradation. They employed a then unconventional experimental approach, in which they isolated an adherence- defective mutant of the bacterium and prepared a specific polyclonal antibody for detection of the functional component. Surprisingly, they isolated a very large multi-sub-unit supra-molecular complex, instead of a small protein. A combination of biochemical, biophysical, immun-ochemical and ultra-structural techniques, followed by molecular biological verification, led to the definition and proof of the cellulosome concept.

She was the co-presenter of Geoff Lloyd with Annabel Port on Absolute Radio from 2008 until the show ended on 12 April 2017. Previously, she has worked on The Geoff Show and read travel reports on the Pete and Geoff Breakfast Show which she hosted along with Lloyd and Pete Mitchell before the latter's departure in December 2005. On 9 May 2011 she won a Gold Sony Radio Award for Best On-Air Contributor. ==Early life and career== Annabel Port was educated at Westcliff High School for Girls and Oxford Brookes University. Prior to working in radio, she taught English to Poles and Mexicans for three years, spent six months doing data input, one week cleaning an old people's home and to her knowledge holds the national record for the 6 years she held a paper round (until the unusually mature age of 18). Port is a former presenter of Whipps Cross Hospital Radio. ==Broadcasting career== Virgin Radio On 14 January 2001 she came to Virgin Radio on a work experience placement and was spotted by Lloyd. Since then she has auditioned to be Michael Hutchence's replacement in INXS and has been to circus school. In a show broadcast on 9 September 2005, Sir Paul McCartney assisted her in completing a song about beef tomatoes. Port worked on the late night show The Geoff Show from its inception in January 2006 until it ended in September 2008, and devised and presented a number of radio features, including \\"Porting Controversy\\", as well as a velvety broadcast voice on the infamous \\"Dirty Book At Bedtime\\". Before 'The Geoff Show', Port also presented features on the Virgin Radio Breakfast Show, which included \\"Annabel's Animals\\" where Geoff was asked to guess the identity of animals brought to the studio by local zoos. A more regular feature was \\"Annabel's Friday Song\\". This is where the aforementioned tomato song with Sir Paul McCartney was aired. This feature is now occasionally resurrected on 'The Geoff Show' when the show does a podcast only show, albeit a \\"bawdy\\" song not fit for broadcast on UK radio. \\"Annabel's Friday Song\\" was usually a short, comical song introducing the coming weekend, with varying topical verses played live by Annabel. The song was introduced as coming \\"From the golden throat of miss Annabel Port\\". Chorus Oh what does it mean when the pubs are all packed at five-thirty? Oh what does it mean when we're all having fish for our tea? Oh what does it mean when Top of the Pops is on the telly? Oh yes, the weekend's nearly here; So sing along with meeee-ee hee hee...

On 9 May 2011 she won a Gold Sony Radio Award for Best On-Air Contributor, beating, among others, Moira Stuart and Mark Kermode. Annabel Port is the author of the music and lyrics of the Dead Dog Memorial Song. The song arose out of a show feature dedicated to listeners' dead dogs; Annabel was set the task of writing a memorial to those dogs. On 15 July 2013 Annabel revealed to the world the Dead Dog Memorial Song on Geoff Lloyd's Hometime Show. The song was then recorded by the band The Boy Least Likely To and released on The Hometime Show on 18 July 2013. Profits from the Dead Dog Memorial Song go the Dogs Trust charity. ==Other work== In August 2017, Annabel began co-hosting a podcast with her former Absolute Radio co-host Geoff Lloyd called Adrift. In April 2018, her first book, Annabel vs. The Internet, was published.

It was operated by the Richmond School District. In the school year 2007-08 it combined with nearby Charles E. London Secondary School to form Steveston-London Secondary School (SLSS). The combined school is on the site of the former London Secondary, with the Steveston Secondary building out of use and demolished. ==History== Steveston Secondary was opened in 1956 originally for students from the Steveston fishing village in southwestern Richmond. Initially, it was a junior high school teaching grades 7-9, then became a combined junior-secondary school, and then it became a Senior Secondary with only Grades 11 and 12. In 1996, it was expanded back again to include the full grades 8-12. New additions to school were completed over the years to account for its burgeoning size. In 1966, an Industrial Education wing was added, in 1970 the library expanded, two new classrooms and home economics labs were added, in 1971 the gym was altered, in 1974 the student lounge was built and in 1978 a Social Studies wing was added. The year 1981 saw the biggest renovation yet, a million-dollar project for Steveston’s Silver Jubilee. The Steveston High School Alumni Association (SHSAA) was established in 1987 by the graduates of 1962 who were celebrating their 25-year reunion. SHSAA was the first public high school alumni association in Canada.Steveston Secondary Website, accessed April 2, 2009 In 1988, the school opened one of the first in-house Fish Hatcheries at a public school in British Columbia. Fish were raised at the school and released into local streams. After the school's 2007-08 merger with Charles E. London Secondary School, the Steveston secondary building has remained vacant. On occasion, the building appeared to be used for the training the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP), possibly in preparation for the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver. As of 2013, the land which the school resides on was purchased by Polygon Homes. The school building was stripped of asbestos in 2015, followed by demolition, which was completed in the summer of 2016 due to remaining traces of asbestos. Subsequently, construction began for Kingsley Estates, a collection of prestigious, 2- and 3-level four-bedroom executive townhomes bordering a 5-acre park. Residents of the new development will also enjoy exclusive access to a private clubhouse and a resident concierge.New Richmond Townhomes  Kingsley Estates  Polygon, accessed December 12, 2015 ==Special Events and Projects== Over the years, there are numerous events that became proud traditions at the school. The Halloween Dance, the Purple and Gold basketball tournament, home opener basketball games, and the home coming dance. Ever since the mid-1970s, Steveston hosted the classic Purple and Gold basketball tournament each year. It consisted of 16 teams from different schools throughout the province. Beginning in 1983, Steveston became a sponsor of the privately run Casa Guatemala Orphanage in Guatemala. The students would spend much of the school year fundraising to help donate to the orphanage, and starting from 1990, the school would send a select group of students to visit and volunteer at the orphanage each year. In 1994-1995, Steveston sponsored Guillermo Perez, a student from Guatemala to spend a year studying at the school. Breakfast with Santa was held annually on the last day of school before the Christmas Holidays. Classes would sing Christmas carols in different languages and staff would be called up to sing \\"The 12 Days of Christmas\\" much to the humour and delight of the students. This event usually raised over $1000 for the Richmond Food Bank. In 1992, the PAC and Dry-Grad committee put on Steveston's first \\"dry grad\\" celebration for Steveston’s graduating students. ==ReferencesExternal links== *School website *Steveston Alumni site Category:High schools in Richmond, British Columbia Category:Educational institutions established in 1956 Category:Educational institutions disestablished in 2007 Category:1956 establishments in British Columbia Category:2007 disestablishments in British Columbia ","title":"Steveston Secondary School"},{"id":"5559822","text":"Baggot Street () is a street in Dublin, Ireland.

Boon Island Light has the distinction of being the tallest lighthouse in both Maine and New England at . The lighthouse has a focal plane at above mean high water. The light's beacon flashes white every 5 seconds. ==History== Talk of building a lighthouse on Boon Island dates back as early as 1710 when the ship Nottingham Galley ran aground on the barren outcrop that makes up the island. The crew of the Galley were forced to resort to cannibalism before being rescued. In 1799 the first day marker and a 50 foot wooden tower were established on the island, but it was washed away in the first 5 years. A stone day beacon was established in its place. In 1811 the station was converted to a full light station and a granite tower was constructed. This first tower was washed away in a storm in 1832. The current 133 foot cylindrical brown granite tower was constructed in 1855 and originally had a second order Fresnel lens installed. At the time, it was the tallest lighthouse in New England (base to tip, but not the highest light above sea level). A new keeper's dwelling was also built at this time. Boon Island Light suffered extensive damage in a blizzard in 1978. Several stones that make up the tower itself were washed into the sea as were all of the keepers dwellings and other outbuildings that had been on the island. As a result, the station was automated in 1980 and a solar powered beacon was installed by the United States Coast Guard. The station is currently active and controlled by the Coast Guard while the lighthouse itself is on lease to the American Lighthouse Foundation. The lighthouse was listed on the National Register of Historic Places as Boon Island Light Station on March 14, 1988, reference number 88000153.https://web.archive.org/web/20170501202418/http://www.uscg.mil/history/weblighthouses/LHME.asp Historical information from Coast Guard web site: President James Madison authorized the building of Boon Island Lighthouse during the War of 1812. A new lighthouse tower was erected near the old tower in 1855, consisting of a gray granite conical tower, 133 feet above the water, off the coast of Maine. As Boon Island is a very flat piece of land, well surrounded by ledges, the tower appears at times to be springing up from the sea from a submerged ledge, especially when low clouds are flying. One of the most isolated stations off the Maine coast, it is also one of the most dangerous. One story is told of how the keepers were once marooned on the island for several weeks because of storms and rough weather. Their food supplies were low and starvation seemed to be staring them in the face. Just at the point of desperation a boat appeared and they signaled for help. The keeper's message in a bottle was picked up by the passing schooner which hove to and anchored until the sea went down. Then the crew packed some food in a mackerel barrel and set it afloat. It drifted right into a little cove on the island and then the sea caught it and bounced it well up on the bank, out of the way of the surf. The hunger of the keepers was appeased until they were able to go ashore and get supplies at the village of York. The lighthouse was purchased from the General Services Administration in 2014 for $78,000, by Art Girard, a resident of Portland, Maine. ==Legends and lore== During the 19th century a keeper died while on the island leaving his wife alone to tend to the station. She did so until she went insane and was found wandering the island by members of a rescue ship. ==Viewing== Boon Island Light is not open to the public. The only way to view the tower is by boat or aircraft. ==Keepers== *David Oliver (c. 1811) *Thomas Hanna (c. 1811-1816) *Eliphalet Grover (1816–1839) *Mark Dennet (1840–1841) *John Thompson (1841–1843) *Morgan Trafton (1842 assistant keeper, lost in boating accident) *John Kennard (1843–1846) *Nathaniel Baker (1849) *John Thompson (1846–1849) *Hiram Tobey (1853) *Caleb S.

The film, distributed by RKO, dramatised the work of RAF Coastal Command. Coastal Command is a documentary-style account of the Short Sunderland and Consolidated PBY Catalina flying boats during the Battle of the Atlantic. The film includes real footage of attacks on a major enemy ship by Hudson and Beaufort bombers based in Iceland. ==Plot== In 1942, a Sunderland flying boat including in its crew Roger Hunter and Flight Sergeant Charles Norman Lewis, set out on a patrol, flying out of their Scottish air base. During the routine sea patrol, in which a convoy is spotted, the crew encounters and bombs a German U-boat. The Sunderland's crew returns to England, mission accomplished, but with a wounded crew member aboard, who is in stable condition. After a visit to the hospital, the Sunderland crew is informed they will be re-deployed to West Africa, to begin a new mission. ==Cast== * Jonny Hyde as Flight Lieutenant Campbell * Roger Hunter as himself * Charles Norman Lewis as himself ==Production== Coastal Command was made under the supervision of Ian Dalrymple, with the full cooperation of the Royal Air Force and the Royal Navy in the Second world War. The participants in the film were active RAF officers, NCOs and aircrew, and RN officers. The film featured Wing Commander Johnny Hyde (RAF officer) DFC in the lead role, pilot Roger Hunter, and Flight Sergeant Charles Norman Lewis. Johnny Hyde (RAF officer) was killed in action over Norway on 29 April 1942. On 25 August 1942, Lewis was killed on a flight that Prince George, Duke of Kent was undertaking as a morale-boosting mission to Iceland.\\"Sgt Charles Norman Lewis.\\" Find A Grave, 13 December 2011.

Coastal Command is notable for its score by Ralph Vaughan Williams. A production scene from Coastal Command. Sergeant Holland (NCOIC Ops Room Clerk) discusses a point with Plotter Assistant Section Officer Bewkey. ==Reviews== The performances in Coastal Command were generally well received as they were real-life depictions of a coastal command unit in wartime. After the release of Coastal Command in the United States on 18 April 1944, Bosley Crowther, film reviewer for The New York Times wrote that it suffered in comparison with the similar Memphis Belle documentary. He did write, however, that: \\"Many of the individual glimpses in this film are intriguing to the eye, and the whole conveys an academic notion of the personal and organizational problems of the Coastal Command. But the obvious studio-staging of much of the action in which personnel is involved and the scattered arrangement of continuity drain the film of sharp immediacy and drive. Because it jumps its scenes from one plane to another, from shore to plane — and even a few times to the Nazi ship—without adequate definition, the spectator is forced to an objective point of view. A sense of artificial construction is plainly inevitable. Thus suspense and excitement are lacking. The mood becomes fitful and blasé.\\"Crowther, Bosley. \\"The screen: 'Coastal Command' (1943); Wings over water.\\" The New York Times, 19 April 1944. ==References== Notes Citations Bibliography * Manvell, Roger.

Athletic organizations within the school are known as the Thomas Haney Thunder. ==Information== Thomas Haney Secondary School (THSS) follows the self-directed model and is currently part of The Canadian Coalition for Self-Directed Learning. At Thomas Haney, courses are split into \\"Learning Guides\\" that are based upon the Ministry of Education's Prescribed Learning Outcomes. Students may negotiate with their teachers to develop their own pathways to demonstrating these outcomes, or they may follow the specific guide activities. THSS attracts global attention and many schools opt to emulate its delivery model. Provincial exam marks at Thomas Haney are consistently above provincial and district averages, and THSS has a higher than average graduation rate compared to other schools in the province; in the 2011-2012 school year the graduation rate at THSS was 93% compared to a provincial average of 81.8%. Over the years, there have been a host of distinct programs made available to Thomas Haney Secondary students. One such program, known as Connections, incorporates Social Studies 11, English 11, Biology 11, and Law 12, in order to give students a \\"real world\\" approach to these subjects and allow them to obtain credit across multiple courses with one assignment. Thomas Haney offers a 4 course, 16 credit Equestrian Academy to both THSS students and students from other schools. Students who complete this program receive a certificate of Equestrian Studies. The Equestrian Academy offers both on-campus and online instruction. With support from professionals in the equestrian community from throughout the province, students learn about a variety of topics from guest speakers such as breeding, training, and coaching. Students also participate in many field trips throughout the program, visiting horse shows, training facilities, and colleges. THSS is also home to the Sightlines Theatre Company and the Raving Thespians Theatresports Team. The school's theatre department produces a mainstage show each year, a director's festival, and often a children's production made available to local elementary audiences. Productions have included: The Diary of Anne Frank, Romeo and Juliet, A Midsummer Night's Dream, The Tempest, 1984, Blithe Spirit, The Crucible, and many others. The Sightlines Theatre has included alumni Cameron Labine (independent film maker and director), Kevin Kraussler (Bard on the Beach), as well as JD, Johnathan and Drew Scott (Property Brothers). Many students have moved onto varying areas of post-secondary study, or pursued careers in performing arts/entertainment industry. == Clubs == School clubs include the Model United Nations Club, an ice hockey program, the Student Council, the Gardening Club and the eSports team. These clubs all have made significant donations to charities. The Model United Nations club allows students to partake in numerous United Nations simulations across the year. Several Thomas Haney students were award winners. In support of the Humboldt, Sask. team tragedy, the Thomas Haney Hockey team raised over $1,000 for the team through school donations. The eSports team is run by Mark Biggar and Todd Goodman. The two teachers, along with an arsenal of students, host a LARP (Live Action Role Play) at the school annually. Student Council at this school has been active for 26 years, their motto is \\"For the Students, By the Students.\\" This student run club's main goal is to bring the community together through events and raise money for local charities. Popular events include: The Wake-a-thon, The Winter Formal, and the Student Council Bottle Drive. This club supports many local charities, including MS Health Canada and Covenant House. Upcoming clubs include an Aviation Club which will explore participating students interest in aviation and a place for students to talk about the subject.  Science Labs  The Science Labs are also large cross grade work spaces that provide students with the opportunity to complete lab work as well as smaller side rooms for small seminars and classroom teaching areas. A \\"science kiosk\\" functions as a dispensary for materials required to complete labs. The Social Studies Great Hall The socials great hall, also known as the McIlroy Room (in honour of a retired educator) provides students with a multi grade work space in which to receive teacher support, to work in small groups, or individually.

It functions under the umbrella of the Kerala State Council for Science, Technology and Environment (KSCSTE), Government of Kerala. The Royal Botanic Gardens (RBG), Kew played an exemplary and significant role in shaping and designing the lay out of the JNTBGRI garden in its formative stages. The Institute undertakes research in conservation biology, Biotechnology, plant taxonomy, microbiology, phytochemistry, ethnomedicine and ethnophamacology, which are the main areas considered to have immediate relevance to the development of the garden. While taxonomists prepared a flora of the garden documenting the native plant wealth before mass introduction and face lift which subsequently followed, the bio-technologists mass multiplied plants of commercial importance, especially orchids for cultivation and distribution to the public. JNTBGRI makes a comprehensive survey of the economic plant wealth of Kerala, to conserve, preserve and sustainably utilize the plant wealth. The institute carries out botanical, horticultural and chemical research for plant improvement and utilization; and offers facilities for the improvement of ornamental plants and propagation in the larger context of the establishment of nursery and flower trade. The cultivation and culturing of plants of India/other countries with comparable climatic condition for the economic benefit of Kerala/India is also taken care. Activities to help botanical teaching and to create public understanding of the value of plant research is initiated by JNTBGRI. JNTBGRI gardens medicinal plants, ornamental plants and various introduced plants of economic or aesthetic value. JNTBGRI also serves as a source of supply of improved plants which are not readily available from other agencies.

For example, a device transmitting a sine wave produces a single peak in the frequency spectrum; however, if the device abruptly starts or stops transmitting this sine wave, it will emit noise at frequencies other than the frequency of the sine wave. This noise is known as spectral splatter. When the signal is represented in the time domain, an abrupt change may not be visually apparent; in the frequency domain, however, the abrupt change causes the appearance of spikes at various frequencies. A sharper change in the time domain usually results in more spikes or stronger spikes in the frequency domain. Spectral splatter can thus be reduced by making the change more smooth. Controlling the power ramp shape (i.e. the way in which the signal increases (\\"power-on ramp\\") or falls off (\\"power-down ramp\\")) can help reduce the splatter. In some cases one can use a filter to remove unwanted emissions. Note that a completely abrupt change (in the mathematical sense) is not possible in physical reality; the change is always somewhat smoothed naturally, for example due to the capacitance (in electronics) or inertia (in acoustics) of the components involved. In radio electronics, the need to minimize spectral splatter arises because signals are usually required by government regulations to be contained in a particular frequency band, defined by a spectral mask. Spectral splatter can cause emissions that violate this mask. == See also == * Gibbs phenomenon Category:Radio electronics Category:Acoustics ","title":"Spectral splatter"},{"id":"5559894","text":"The Metro Transit Police Department (MTPD) is the policing agency of the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA), created by the WMATA Compact on June 4, 1976. The MTPD is unique in U.S. law enforcement as it is the only U.S. police agency that has police authority in relation to the metro system in three different jurisdictions: Maryland, Virginia, and the District of Columbia The department has an authorized strength of 490 sworn officers, 170 Special Police Officers, and more than 100 civilian personnel. New sworn officers complete 23 weeks of initial training at the Northern Virginia Criminal Justice Training Academy, followed by 15 weeks of training at the Metro Transit Police Academy, which includes training in Maryland and District of Columbia law, then 10 weeks of field training with a field training officer. Upon completion of training, all sworn officers are fully accredited police officers within the State of Maryland, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Virginia, and have the same police authority as the local police departments located within the boundaries of the Metro service area. The MTPD is accredited by the Commission on Accreditation for Law Enforcement Agencies. ==Patrols== Former patch of the MTPD, used from the 1990s to 2016. A Ford Crown Victoria Police Interceptor of the MTPD at the Wheaton station in October 2009. Uniformed and plainclothes Transit Police officers patrol the Metrorail and Metrobus systems on foot, bicycles, motorcycles, and marked and unmarked police cars. Transit Police detectives provide investigative support. Transit Police officers have jurisdiction and arrest powers throughout the Metro service area for crimes and traffic infractions that occur on Transit Authority facilities, within of a Metrobus stop, or that endanger Metro property or patrons. Transit Police are actively involved in protecting Metro passengers and infrastructure from terrorist threats. After the September 11, 2001 attacks, the 2004 Madrid train bombings, and the July 7, 2005 London subway bombings, and periodically since, members of the Metro Transit Police Special Response Team conduct security sweeps of the rail system while armed with special weapons systems, H&K; MP5 submachine guns and supported by explosive ordnance detection K-9 teams. Additionally, the department has a dedicated explosive disposal team. Metro Police cars are issued standard District of Columbia passenger license plates same as civilian vehicles, but to make it more difficult for impostors to impersonate a transit police car, Metro installs its own police license plates on its cars. Officers are currently issued the SIG Sauer P320 Carry 9mm which is used as the standard issue sidearm. Prior to this, officers carried a SIG Sauer P226 or P229, chambered for .40 S&W.; Officers are also trained and certified to carry pepperball launchers and shotguns. Fallen officers Since the establishment of the Metro Transit Police Department, two officers have been killed in the line of duty. Officer Harry Davis, Jr., was shot and killed in Landover, Maryland, while investigating a stolen vehicle parked at a Metro facility near the Landover station on December 20, 1993. Officer Marlon Morales was shot in the District of Columbia by a fare evasion suspect at the U Street Metro station on June 10, 2001. Morales succumbed to his wounds and died on June 13, 2001. The suspects in both murders were identified, captured, tried, and convicted. Davis' killer was convicted of first degree murder, and Morales' killer was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole on July 30, 2004. ==Policies== Eating and drinking Local ordinances strictly forbid riders from eating or drinking while on board a Metrobus, Metrorail train, or inside stations.Prince George's County (Md.) Code, § 20A-102 Officers are required to take police action when they observe any criminal activity, but arrests for these minor violations are rare. One exception was on October 23, 2000, when a 12-year-old girl was arrested, searched, and handcuffed for refusing to stop eating french fries while in the Tenleytown–AU Metro station. She was taken to a police juvenile processing area where she was booked, fingerprinted, and detained until her mother arrived to pick her up.Hedgepeth v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 386 F.3d 1148 (D.C. Cir. 2004) At the time of the incident, the officer had no legal authority to take any formal action against a juvenile other than make an arrest. This policy has since been changed and MTPD officers may now issue written warnings to juvenile offenders. Another widely noted case occurred on July 16, 2004, when an EPA employee entered the Metro Center station with a PayDay candy bar. Before passing through the fare gates, patrolling police officers told her to finish eating before she could enter the paid area. Instead, she popped the last bite of the bar into her mouth, continuing to chew it while in the station. She was subsequently arrested after refusing to cooperate with the issuance of a citation for the offense. Doug Berman, creator producer of NPR shows Car Talk and Wait Wait...Don't Tell Me!, was often credited on the former by the nickname \\"Subway Fugitive\\", supposedly dating to an incident where he was being ticketed for consuming coffee in a Metro station, but slipped onto a train, escaping the citation. While sometimes seen as excessive, Metro's zero-tolerance policy, when it comes to crime, including eating, drinking, littering, and other forms of disorder, embodies the broken windows philosophy of crime reduction. According to criminal justice author Nancy G. La Vigne, Metro's attempts to reduce crime, combined with how the station environments were designed with crime prevention in mind, has contributed to the fact that Washington Metro was regarded to be among the safest and cleanest subway systems in the United States in 1996. This has recently been challenged in the media and community after several safety incidents including a full day shutdown on March 15, 2016. Restrooms The broken windows philosophy also extends to use of station restroom facilities. Metro's long-standing policy restricts use of restrooms to only employees in order to prevent undesirable activity such as graffiti. One widely publicized example of this was when a pregnant woman was denied access to the bathroom by a station manager at the Shady Grove station in June 2016. Metro now allows the use of restrooms by passengers who gain a station manager's permission, except during periods of heightened terror alerts. Random bag searches On October 27, 2008, the Metro Transit Police announced plans to immediately begin random searches of backpacks, purses, and other bags. Transit police would search riders at random before boarding a bus or entering a station. It also explained its intent to stop anyone acting suspiciously. Metro claims that \\"Legal authority to inspect packages brought into the Metro system has been established by the court system on similar types of inspections in mass transit properties, airports, military facilities and courthouses.\\" Metro Transit Police Chief Michael Taborn stated that, if someone were to turn around and simply enter the system through another escalator or elevator, Metro has \\"a plan to address suspicious behavior\\". Security expert Bruce Schneier characterized the plan as \\"security theater against a movie plot threat\\" and does not believe random bag searches actually improve security. The Metro Riders' Advisory Council recommended to WMATA's board of directors that Metro hold at least one public meeting regarding the search program. , Metro had not conducted a single bag search. In 2010 Metro once again announced that it would implement random bag searches, and conducted the first such searches on December 21, 2010. The searches consist of swabbing bags and packages for explosive residue, and X-raying or opening any packages which turned up positive. On the first day of searches, at least one false positive for explosives was produced, which Metro officials indicated could occur for a variety of reasons including if a passenger had recently been in contact with firearms or been to a firing range. The D.C. Bill of Rights Coalition and the Montgomery County Civil Rights Coalition circulated a petition against random bag searches, taking the position that the practice violates the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution and would not improve security. On January 3, 2011, Metro held a public forum for the searches at a Metro Riders' Advisory Council meeting, at which more than 50 riders spoke out, most of them in opposition to the searches. However, at the meeting, Metro officials called random bag inspections a \\"success\\" and claimed that few riders had complained.

In Pope Clement VIII's Missal of 1604, it was given the newly invented rank of Greater Double. In Pope John XXIII's 1960 calendar, it became a Third-Class Feast.General Roman Calendar of 1960 This 1960 calendar, included in the 1962 edition of the Roman Missal, is the calendar whose continued use privately and, under certain conditions, publicly is authorized by the motu proprio Summorum Pontificum. Nine years later, the celebration became an optional memorial. The feast commemorates the dedication by Pope Sixtus III of the rebuilt Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore just after the First Council of Ephesus. This major basilica, located on the summit of the Esquiline Hill in Rome, is called the Basilica of Santa Maria Maggiore () because it is the largest church in Rome dedicated to the Blessed Virgin Mary. The original church, which was replaced by that of Pope Sixtus III, was built during the pontificate of Pope Liberius (352–366), and is thus sometimes known as the Basilica Liberii or Basilica Liberiana. == Legend == \\"Our Lady of the Snows\\", Mathis Gothart Grünewald Until 1969 the feast was known as Dedicatio Sanctae Mariae ad Nives (Dedication of the Church of Our Lady of the Snows), a name that had become popular for the Basilica in the 14th century in connection with a legend about its origin that the Catholic Encyclopedia summarizes: (in the middle of the 4th century) \\"During the pontificate of Liberius, the Roman patrician John and his wife, who were without heirs, made a vow to donate their possessions to the Virgin Mary. They prayed that she might make known to them how they were to dispose of their property in her honour. On 5 August, at the height of the Roman summer, snow fell during the night on the summit of the Esquiline Hill. In obedience to a vision of the Virgin Mary that they had the same night, the couple built a basilica in honour of Mary on the very spot that was covered with snow. From the fact that no mention whatever is made of this alleged miracle until a few hundred years later, not even by Sixtus III in his eight-line dedicatory inscription ... it would seem that the legend has no historical basis.\\" In fact there is no reference to the legend before the year 1000.American Catholic, \\"Dedication of St. Mary Major Basilica\\" The popularity of the legend in the 15th century is shown in the painting of the Miracle of the Snow by Masolino da Panicale of around 1423, now in the Museo di Capodimonte, Naples, in which the miracle is depicted as witnessed by a crowd of men and women, with Jesus and the Virgin Mary observing from above, and by the building in that century and the immediately following centuries of many churches dedicated to Our Lady of the Snows, of which 152 still exist in Italy.:it:Madonna della Neve A more critical attitude began to prevail in the 18th century, as evidenced by the proposal that a congregation set up by Pope Benedict XIV presented to him in 1741 that the reading of the legend be removed from the Roman Breviary and that the original name, \\"Dedicatio Sanctae Mariae\\", be restored. This recommendation was implemented only in 1969, 228 years later. ==Legacy of the legend== On 5 August each year, during the celebration of the liturgical feast of the Dedication of the Basilica of St. Mary Major, a custom that commemorates the story of the miraculous snowfall is still maintained: at the conclusion of the Solemn Mass in the basilica, a shower of white rose petals is dropped from the dome of the Chapel of Our Lady.Mauriello, Matthew R. \\"Our Lady of the Snows\\", Fairfield County Catholic, January 1996 At sunset on the same day, an artificial \\"snowfall\\" is staged as a tourist attraction in the square outside the basilica.Normanno Ross, \\"The Miracle of the Snow\\" Apart from the above-mentioned many shrines of the Madonna della Neve in Italy, the United States has a \\"National Shrine of Our Lady of the Snows\\" in Belleville, Illinois, and parishes dedicated to \\"Our Lady of the Snows\\" are located in Reno, Nevada; Floral Park, New York,Our Lady of the Snows Church, Floral Park, New York Milford, MichiganSt. Mary, Our Lady of the Snows and Woodstock, Vermont.Our Lady of the Snows Roman Catholic Church, Woodstock, Vermont, St. Mary's Our Lady of The Snows, Milford, Michigan In Croatia, Bol on the island of Brač as well as the parish church in Mamre on the island of Pag are dedicated to the Lady of the Snows.

Construction of a new two-room schoolhouse began in 1916.Prince George Star: 10 & 20 Oct 1916, & 21 Nov 1916 Opened in 1917, the school comprised both elementary and high school grades. However, many students boarded in main centres elsewhere to attend larger high schools. The McBride school went to grade 11. Addressing a need, grade 12Prince George Citizen, 27 Jul 1939 was introduced using correspondence course material for 1939–1940.Prince George Citizen, 25 Jul 1940. Assumedly in subsequent years, the more traditional methodology was used. The elementary grades relocated to the Legion Hall, but in 1942, swapped with the secondary students to better utilize the respective spaces.Prince George Citizen, 30 Jul 1942. The 1946 implementation of the 1945 Cameron Report into BC school financing and administration, which ushered in centralized larger school districts, included the creation of School District #58 (McBride) (SD58). When the new high school building opened in 1948, the immediate need was housing the elementary grades, whose building had recently been destroyed by fire.Prince George Citizen, 25 Mar 1948 Consequently, the high school returned to the Legion Hall, and a room at the rear of Woodley's Garage, and the elementary students occupied the new four-room building. In 1950, a dormitory opened to board students from a catchment area stretching from Dome Creek to Valemount. For two decades, until the highway north was completed, student boarders would arrive each term by passenger rail, or boat during railway strikes.Prince George Citizen, 19 Sep 1966. In 1953, the new junior high building opened,Prince George Citizen, 19 Feb 1953 and the various temporary classroom accommodation was no longer needed. Added were four classrooms in 1955, and a comparable space in 1969. Prior to 1963, the elementary and secondary schools shared a principal. In 1970, SD 58 merged into School District 57 Prince George, and the SD 58 board was dissolved. The new enlarged school district matches the boundaries of the Regional District of Fraser-Fort George.Prince George Citizen, 18 Jun 1970 The redundant McBride dormitory became an art and music facility. A rebuilt school opened in 1990, with a theatre and full-size gym. In the past, grades 11 and 12 have not always been offered. Enrolment for 1950 was 95, 1960 was 165, 1970 was 177, 1980 was 162, 1990 was 110, 2000 was 127, 2010 was 106, and 2020 was 60. Technology has snowballed distance education. Courses have been completed on school grounds, or at home, which avoids taking an often long, arduous school bus ride. This choice has further reduced the McBride Secondary population, which in turn has increased the gap between the range of programs available at a city high school and a small rural one like McBride.Prince George Citizen, 4 Feb 2011 The growth of independent schools has also been a factor. The board has considered combining the secondary and elementary schools. However, the plan was shelved, because each plays a prominent role in the community, and the unfunded costs to retrofit the high school were prohibitive.Prince George Citizen, 3 Nov 2016 In 2016, a $270,000 upgrade of the school boiler increased energy efficiency.Prince George Citizen: 1 & 29 Sep 2016 Academic achievements In 2010, Amy von der Gonna received the $2,500 Prince of Wales Scholarship, the most prestigious award in SD 57.Prince George Citizen, 29 Jun 2010 Sports achievements The wrestling team placed third at the BC Summer Games, and sixth at the BC Provincial Championships.

Westminster Abbey served as its cathedral. ==History== The diocese was one of six founded by Henry VIII in 1539–40, with the churches of dissolved abbeys serving as their cathedrals. The others were Bristol, Chester, Gloucester, Oxford and Peterborough. It was created from part of the Diocese of London, and comprised Westminster (which was raised to the dignity of a city), and the county of Middlesex, with the exception of Fulham. Fulham was excluded as it was the site of Fulham Palace, residence of the Bishop of London. Henry established the new diocese by letters patent of 17 December 1540, which reconstituted the former monastery of St Peter, Westminster, (today generally known simply as \\"Westminster Abbey\\") as a cathedral, with a bishop, dean and twelve canons. Thomas Thirlby was appointed as the bishop and William Benson or Boston, who had been abbot of Westminster before the Dissolution, became dean; the Middlesex archdeaconry moved into the jurisdiction of the new diocese and bishop. In 1550 the diocese of Westminster was reunited with that of London. Thirlby surrendered the diocese on 30 March and was made Bishop of Norwich, while Nicholas Ridley became Bishop of London and Westminster. In 1552 an act of parliament of confirmed the status of Westminster as a \\"cathedral church and episcopal see to the bishop of London\\". Westminster Abbey finally lost its cathedral status in 1556, during the reign of Queen Mary, when the chapter was abolished and the monastery restored.

An appeal to launch this grouping took place on 13 June 2006. Despite bearing many of the hallmarks of a platform within the SSP, United Left did not view themselves as such, and described themselves as a network rather than a platform. Within the wider SSP however they were widely regarded as a platform. The grouping was formed following a crisis within the party associated with the Tommy Sheridan defamation case and publication of an open letter by former SSP convener Tommy Sheridan, distributed to members which alleged a long-standing slander campaign conducted against him by senior party figures, MSPs and some grassroots activists. Against a backdrop of rising tension, the group's formation was widely seen as an early indication of an impending purge and possible split within the party. However, that analysis ran counter to the content of the group's appeal, which confirmed the signatories' commitment to uniting and building the SSP as a radical socialist party capable of challenging the capitalist system. The group's founding statement was initially distributed in the name of Pam Currie, SSP LGBT spokesperson, and three rank-and-file members. Other signatories include three SSP MSPs, Frances Curran, Rosie Kane, and Carolyn Leckie, co-chair Morag Balfour, the editor of the SSP's weekly paper Joanne Harvie, and both SSP councillors, Keith Baldassara and Jim Bollan. In response to the formation of the United Left faction within the SSP, supporters of Sheridan formed a grouping they termed \\"SSP Majority\\", and issued an Open Letter to SSP members, calling for signatories and supporters. Many of the signatories to the Majority statement subsequently left the party when Tommy Sheridan formed his own party, Solidarity on 3 September 2006. The United Left dissolved on 20 January 2007, considering that the grouping had served its purpose, with its members becoming non-platform members of the SSP once again. ==External links== * Scottish Socialist Party Website Category:Factions of the Scottish Socialist Party Category:Political parties established in 2006 Category:Political parties disestablished in 2007 ","title":"Scottish Socialist Party United Left"},{"id":"5560112","text":"Valemount Secondary is a public high school in Valemount, British Columbia part of School District 57 Prince George.

In this formalism, infinite- dimensional vector spaces are not dualizable, since the dual vector space V∗ doesn't satisfy the axioms. Often, an object is dualizable only when it satisfies some finiteness or compactness property. A category in which each object has a dual is called autonomous or rigid. The category of finite- dimensional vector spaces with the standard tensor product is rigid, while the category of all vector spaces is not. ==Motivation== Let V be a finite- dimensional vector space over some field K. The standard notion of a dual vector space V∗ has the following property: for any K-vector spaces U and W there is an adjunction HomK(U ⊗ V,W) = HomK(U, V∗ ⊗ W), and this characterizes V∗ up to a unique isomorphism. This expression makes sense in any category with an appropriate replacement for the tensor product of vector spaces. For any monoidal category (C, ⊗) one may attempt to define a dual of an object V to be an object V∗ ∈ C with a natural isomorphism of bifunctors :HomC((–)1 ⊗ V, (–)2) → HomC((–)1, V∗ ⊗ (–)2) For a well-behaved notion of duality, this map should be not only natural in the sense of category theory, but also respect the monoidal structure in some way. An actual definition of a dual object is thus more complicated. In a closed monoidal category C, i.e. a monoidal category with an internal Hom functor, an alternative approach is to simulate the standard definition of a dual vector space as a space of functionals. For an object V ∈ C define V∗ to be \\\\underline{\\\\mathrm{Hom}}_C(V, \\\\mathbb{1}_C), where 1C is the monoidal identity. In some cases, this object will be a dual object to V in a sense above, but in general it leads to a different theory. ==Definition== Consider an object X in a monoidal category (\\\\mathbf{C},\\\\otimes, I, \\\\alpha, \\\\lambda, \\\\rho). The object X^* is called a left dual of X if there exist two morphisms :\\\\eta:I\\\\to X\\\\otimes X^*, called the coevaluation, and \\\\varepsilon:X^*\\\\otimes X\\\\to I, called the evaluation, such that the following two diagrams commute: {  350px  width=\\"100pt\\"  center;\\"  and  350px } The object X is called the right dual of X^*. This definition is due to . Left duals are canonically isomorphic when they exist, as are right duals. When C is braided (or symmetric), every left dual is also a right dual, and vice versa. If we consider a monoidal category as a bicategory with one object, a dual pair is exactly an adjoint pair. ==Examples== * Consider a monoidal category (VectK, ⊗K) of vector spaces over a field K with the standard tensor product. A space V is dualizable if and only if it is finite-dimensional, and in this case the dual object V∗ coincides with the standard notion of a dual vector space. * Consider a monoidal category (ModR, ⊗R) of modules over a commutative ring R with the standard tensor product. A module M is dualizable if and only if it is a finitely generated projective module. In that case the dual object M∗ is also given by the module of homomorphisms HomR(M, R). * Consider a homotopy category of pointed spectra Ho(Sp) with the smash product as the monoidal structure. If M is a compact neighborhood retract in \\\\mathbb{R}^n (for example, a compact smooth manifold), then the corresponding pointed spectrum Σ∞(M+) is dualizable. This is a consequence of Spanier–Whitehead duality, which implies in particular Poincaré duality for compact manifolds. * The category \\\\mathrm{End}(\\\\mathbf{C}) of endofunctors of a category \\\\mathbf{C} is a monoidal category under composition of functors. A functor F is a left dual of a functor G iff F is left adjoint to G.See for example exercise 2.10.4 in Pavel Etingof \\"Tensor Categories\\". == Categories with duals == A monoidal category where every object has a left (respectively right) dual is sometimes called a left (respectively right) autonomous category. Algebraic geometers call it a left (respectively right) rigid category. A monoidal category where every object has both a left and a right dual is called an autonomous category. An autonomous category that is also symmetric is called a compact closed category. ==Traces== Any endomorphism f of a dualizable object admits a trace, which is a certain endomorphism of the monoidal unit of C. This notion includes, as very special cases, the trace in linear algebra and the Euler characteristic of a chain complex. ==See also== * Dualizing object == References == * * * Category:Monoidal categories ","title":"Dual object"},{"id":"5560200","text":"Football is by far the most popular sport in Paraguay to the point that it is part of the nation's culture. ==History== Football arrived to Paraguay in the late 1800s. There are differing versions as to how this happened. The most commonly held account is that of William Paats. This account has much primary source documentation (newspaper articles) As this version goes, football was first introduced in Paraguay by Dutchman William Paats, who moved from the Netherlands to Asunción (the capital of Paraguay) in 1888. During a trip to Buenos Aires Paats bought a football and brought it back to Asunción in order to teach the sport, which was unknown among Paraguayans.Cien Años de Historia: Sudor, Lagrimas, Sangre, y Victoria At first, football was only practiced by the \\"elite\\" (upper class) but it soon became very popular and spread quickly throughout the whole country to people of all social classes. Another version brings the genesis of football in Paraguay a bit further back, to 1886 and in the area around Borja. Miguel Angel Bestard, in his authoritative volume \\"Paraguay: One Century of Football\\" recounts a story about how English railroad workers organized games against the local Paraguayans. The English team was named \\"Everton\\", as a clear homage to the club from Liverpool, England. In 1900, small tournaments were held at the Plaza de Armas, a plaza located in downtown Asunción. Because of the huge success of the tournaments and the large attendances for the games, Paats decided to found the first Paraguayan football club, which he named Olimpia Football Club (later renamed Club Olimpia) in 1902. By 1906 the number of football clubs in Paraguay had increased and the Paraguayan Football Association (governing body of football in Paraguay) was founded. In 1910, Paraguay formed its first national squad to play against the squad from Corrientes, Argentina, but it would have to wait till 1919 for the Argentine national team to take a boat upriver on the Parana River and visit Asuncion for the first official international games Paraguay would ever play. The Paraguayan Football Association joined CONMEBOL in 1921, and FIFA in 1925. Football has grown enormously since then, and there are over 1600 teams spread throughout Paraguay participating in bla leagues. Each of those teams try to make their way to the first division by clearing the different levels of lower divisions. The growth and evolution of Paraguayan football can be seen in the achievements made in the club level and by the Paraguayan national football team. The national team has participated in eight FIFA World Cups, won two Copa América tournaments, and earned a silver medal at the Olympic Games in 2004. All these accomplishments established Paraguay as the fourth most successful football nation in South America behind Argentina, Brazil and Uruguay. At the club level, Olimpia Asunción has won a total of eight international tournaments, including three Copa Libertadores and one Intercontinental Cup. Among the most important and successful football players in Paraguayan history are Arsenio Erico, Aurelio González, Romerito and José Luis Chilavert. ==Television and Media== English coverage of Paraguayan football was accessible online until 2015 by football writer and Guinness World Records Latin American representative Ralph Hannah.https://tribuna.com/en/fcbarcelona/news/b7ebfccc-353f-45f0-95bc-d484219b666e/https://thesefootballtimes.co/2014/12/17/a-tale- of-one-city-asuncion/http://lowlimitfutbol.com/low-limit-futbol- episode-275-ralph-hannah/https://www.linkedin.com/in/ralph-hannah-gwr ==League system== Paraguay's Football League System consists of Four Divisions, plus a 'Primera de Ascenso' from Regional leagues which the top two teams from each league will join the regionalized Fourth Division. ==Clubs== The majority of clubs count with the categories of: * First–Team * Reserve–Team * U20 * U19 * U18 * U17 * U16 * U15 * School of Football ==See also== * Paraguayan football league system * Primera División Paraguaya * División Intermedia * Paraguayan Tercera División * Paraguayan Primera División B * Primera División B Nacional * Paraguayan Cuarta División * Campeonato Nacional de Interligas * Unión del Fútbol del Interior * Paraguayan women's football championship * Football Federation of the 1st Department Concepción * Football Federation of the 2nd Department San Pedro * Football Federation of the 3rd Department Cordillera * Football Federation of the 4th Department Guairá * Football Federation of the 5th Department Caaguazú * Football Federation of the 6th Department Caazapá * Football Federation of the 7th Department Itapúa * Football Federation of the 8th Department Misiones * Football Federation of the 9th Department Paraguarí * Football Federation of the 10th Department Alto Paraná * Football Federation of the 11th Department Central * Football Federation of the 12th Department Ñeembucú * Football Federation of the 13th Department Amambay * Football Federation of the 14th Department Canindeyú * Football Federation of the 15th Department Presidente Hayes * Football Federation of the 16th Department Alto Paraguay * Football Federation of the 17th Department Boquerón ==ReferencesExternal links== *Paraguayan football association website *Paraguayan football history (in Spanish) ","title":"Football in Paraguay"},{"id":"5560212","text":"The Tsentralnyi Rynok (; ) is a station on Kharkiv Metro's Kholodnohirsko–Zavodska Line. The station was opened on August 23, 1975. It is located in the central part of Kharkiv, near the №2 bus station and the Tsentralny Rynok, literally Central Market, for which the station is named. In the beginning, a station named Kommynalnyi Rynok was planned to be built in the Blagoveschenskyi Raion. But during the examining pre-construction stage, the hydro-geological circumstances proved to be too poor for the construction of the station. As a result, the station was planned to be located some way to one side. The station is lain shallow underground and is a single-vault design with a rounded ceiling. The station itself was designed by V.A. Spivachuk, and engineered by P.D Pashkov and Y.V. Lysenko. The partitions tracks have been held by grey marble, which has been introduced in traditional Ukrainian folk relief designs. The floor has been paved with multi-coloured polished granite, which is reminiscent of a carpet-like design. Wide stairs which lead passengers to a station vestibule are located on both ends of the station, which gives the station an open feeling. The walls of the vestibule are decorated with light-grey and light-rose coloured marble. The Tsentralny Rynok station is unique because it has a rounded ceiling which is held up with numerous rose marble columns. These columns were added in 1996 after serious deterioration of the ceiling caused by high levels of precipitation due to heavy rain fall in the summer of that year. However, during the column additions to the station, a task which lasted about a year, the station continued to be in full operation. Tsentralny Rynok Station is located near Dim Trohivli (a four-story department store), Avto Vokzal 2 (a bus terminal) and the Kharkiv Yeshiva Ketana (a Jewish religious school for boys). ==External links== * Tsentralny Rynok on Gortransport Kharkiv site Category:Kharkiv Metro stations Category:Railway stations opened in 1975 ","title":"Tsentralnyi Rynok (Kharkiv Metro)"},{"id":"5560214","text":"FC Ameri Tbilisi was a Georgian football club based in the district of Gldani in Tbilisi.

The dialects have been variously classified as the northeastern varieties of Galician,Alonso Zamora Vicente, Dialectología Española, Biblioteca Románica Hispánica, Editorial Gredos. Madrid, (1960), p. 85 as a linguistic group of its own,Alonso y Fernández de las Redondas, Damaso, complete Works, Gredos (1971), vol. I, p. 391 or as a dialect of transition between Galician and Asturian.García Arias, former president of ALLA, {ger}, Sprachgeschichte, /asturiano: evolución lingüística externa\\", G. Holtus M. Metzelzin E. Ch. Schmitt (eds.), Lexikon der Roamnistischen Linguistik vol .VI, 1 Tubingen, Max Niemayer, 1992, p. 681 The area where the dialects are spoken includes the Asturian municipalities of Boal, Castropol, Coaña, Eilao, El Franco, Grandas de Salime, Pezós, San Martín de Ozcos, Santalla de Ozcos, Santiso de Abres, Tapia de Casariego, Taramundi, A Veiga, Vilanova de Ozcos, and partially those of Navia, Ibias, Villayón, and Allande. Other terms used include gallego–asturiano, the official term in Asturias, Used in the \\"Disposición additional\\" (Addenda) of the Ley 1/98, de 23 de marzo, de uso y promoción del bable/asturiano (Law 1/98 of use and promotion of Asturian language) meaning \\"Galician–Asturian language\\", a fala (\\"the speech\\", not to be confused with the Fala language of Extremadura) and Galego de Asturias (\\"Galician language of Asturias\\"). The term Eonaviego was first used by the linguist Xavier Frías Conde, who translated it as Eonavian in English, Éonavien in French, and Eonavienc in Catalan. In 2007, the Academy of the Asturian Language accepted the term Eonavian to refer to the dialect. The set of dialects was traditionally included by linguists as Galician- Portuguese or Galician, with some characteristics of the Astur-Leonese group. That was the opinion of such linguists as Menéndez Pidal, Menéndez Pidal, R (1906): \\"El dialecto Leonés\\", Revista de Archivos, Bibliotecas y Museos, 2-3:130-131 Eugenio Coseriu, Luís Lindley Cintra, Lindley Cintra, Luís F. Nova proposta de classificação dos dialectos Galego-Portugueses Boletim de Filologia, Lisboa, Centro de Estudos Filológicos, 1971, p. 16-17 Dámaso Alonso, and more recent ones such as Francisco Xavier Frías Conde Frías Conde, F. X. (2002): O galego exterior ás fronteiras administrativas. Gijón:VTP and Xoán Babarro. Babarro, X. (2003): Galego de Asturias. Fundación Pedro Barrié de la Maza Now, however, there is a political-linguistic conflict on the identity of the language between those who prioritise the mixed identity and those that continue to prioritise the Galician substratum. Supporters of the former, mostly in Asturias, identify Eonavian as a dialect continuum between the Asturian and Galician languages or even a third language belonging to Portuguese-Galician group spoken only in that area (Ruth González Rodríguez, Ricardo Saavedra Fernández-Combarro and Xoxé Miguel Suárez). See the points of view of Suárez Fernández La Nueva España newspaper and Ruth González and Ricardo Saavedra Un estudio concluye que la fala es una lengua con entidad propia , Supporters of the latter, mostly in Galicia, identify it as Galician and want the same protection as Galician in Castile and Leon, which protects the dialects of El Bierzo in cooperation with the Galician government. ==Classification== Linguistic areas of Asturias, attending only to scientific criteria. In green, Asturogalician languages and in purple, Asturoleonese languages From a philological point of view, the origin of the language is surely in the Galician-Portuguese language family, the dominant language in the northwest of the Iberian peninsula in the Middle Ages. That follows from an examination of the more than six hundred parchments preserved in the monastery of Villanueva de Oscos. An examination of the documents of the monastery, written from the late 12th to early 14th centuries, show a certain identity between this language and the Galician-Portuguese language. See Alvárez Castrillón, Xose A. Colección diplomática del monasterio de Santa María de Villanueva de Oscos (1139-1300), Ridea, 2011 For the early stage, there are only documented translations of copies of ancient Latin deeds that were beginning to be unintelligible to the common people, (v. AHN sec. clergy, carp. 1617, AHN, Sec Clergy, carp. No. 1617. 15, no. 2, Sec AHN clergy carp. 1621 No 15 etc.), and there would not be until the mid-13th century that the first original deeds were written in the Galician-Portuguese language. In the early 14th century, the oddness of this language with the rest of the galacoifonía, was noticed. The most of these developments were the result of the Castilian language advancement in the urban centres of the River Eo: Revoredo, Ribadeo and Castropol, such influence was more significant in the writings of the bishops' notaries of Oviedo in these villages, but if the influence of Castilian was growing in the urban centres, the manuscripts of the monastery notaries still kept the original features of this language, and others were added that then appeared. The cartulary of Oscos is an essential landmark for understanding the evolution of the Galician-Portuguese language, but the monastery's influence was ended with the arrival of the Castillian congregation in 1511. That started another period of great economic and social growth of the monastery around the iron industries, but the installation of the reformed order ended the written language, until its re-emergence in the late 19th century. ==Comparative table== {  - !width=\\"10%\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"Latin !width=\\"30%\\" colspan=\\"3\\"  Galician !width=\\"10%\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Eonavian !width=\\"10%\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Galician- portuguese !width=\\"10%\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Portuguese !width=\\"10%\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Western Asturian !width=\\"8%\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Spanish !width=\\"8%\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  English - !

Here are the vowels obtained by García García in the El Franco village (GG, 1976) and Fernández Vior in Vegadeo (FV ,1997): ::• ä Open central unrounded vowel: f1 =700 y f2 =1350 hz (FV); f1 =750 y f2 =1500 hz (GG) ::: – a: Long open central unrounded vowel: f1 =870 y f2 =1463 hz (FV); f1 =800 y f2 =1537 hz (GG) ::: – Open front unrounded vowel: f1 =700 y f2 =1300 hz (FV); f1 =715 hz y f2 =1400 hz (GG) ::: – ɑ Open back unrounded vowel): ::• e Close-mid front unrounded vowel: f1 =450 hz y f2 =1900 hz (FV) ::: – e Close-mid front unrounded vowel affected by front sound: f1 =475 hz y f2 =1700 hz (GG) ::: – e Close-mid front unrounded vowel affected by back sound: f1 =525 hz y f2 =1800 hz (GG) ::• ɛ Open-mid front unrounded vowel: f1 =700 hz y f2 =1800 hz (FV) ::• o Close-mid back rounded vowel: f1 =490 y f2 =1015 (FV); f1 =500 y f2=1075 (GG) ::• ɔ Open-mid back rounded vowel: f1 =555 hz y f2 =1100 (FV): f1 =600 hz y f2 =1100 hz (GG) ::• i Close front unrounded vowel: f1 =337 y f2 =2300 (FV); f1 =400 y f2 =2600 hz (GG) ::• u Close back rounded vowel: f1 =350 y f1 =1185 (FV); f1 =400 y f2 =925 hz (GG) As it was indicated by García García regarding unstressed vowels, \\"Unlike other areas of Galician phonetics, there are no relevant differences between open and closed -e- and -o- and the sound of variant pairs can be considered, each with their own archiphonemes, keeping the following system: -i-, E-, a,-O-, u. See García García, José,He speaks of theFranco, pp. 119. Unstressed vowels in final position There are three unstressed vowels in final position: -e-,-o-and-a -. See García García, José, El habla de El Franco, p. 73 There is the loss of the -o endings -ene and -inu, ‘sen’, ‘fren’, ‘centen’, 'allén', ‘padrín’, ‘camín’..., an overall conservation \\"-e\\" syllables end, after ‘-ete’ and ‘ite’ headquarters, 'rede', 'vide', 'parede', etc... It is clearer still in place names ‘San Mamede’, ‘Nonide’, ‘Taladride’. It is also normal to conserve \\"-e\\" after \\"θ\\" like in ‘couce, 'fouce', etc. On the other hand, under the influence of Castilian, ‘salú’, ‘verdá’, ‘enfermedá’, it has been lost The paragogic vowel -e- after liquids consonant appear very residually, Acevedo y Huelves cites ‘carcele’. Final vowel -o- has disappeared in suffix -elo, in toponyms: ‘Tol’, ‘Castropol’, ‘Boal’, etc. Until the 19th century, nasal vowels were a fairly common phenomenon throughout Eonaviego but today are very unusual. Damaso Alonso was the first in confirming the phenomenon, widespread in the nearby Ancares Mountains. M. Menéndez García finds nasality remains in Freixulfe and points in Villallón Village, y Celso Muñiz in the Valledor region, in the frontier with the Asturo-Leonese languages. These remnants of nasal vowels in Eonavian explain that the syllables ended in nasal coda are always opened, the necessary consequence of velarization, the stage prior to the formation of the nasal. See Fernández Fernández, Marcelino, El Franco y su concejo, p. 51, Dámaso Alonso y García Yebra «Cuadernos de estudios gallegos, XVI», Santiago de Compostela 1.961 pp. 43-79, see too by the language Ancares Mountains «El gallego-leonés de los Ancarés y su interés para la dialectología portuguesa», in II Coloquio de Estudios Luso Brasileiro, Lisboa p. 331. A change in unstressed vowels when absolute enclitic position has labial consonant and vowel assimilation. See García García, José, El habla de El Franco, p. 83. Regarding the unstressed vowels, as pointed out by García García, \\"Unlike other areas of the Galaicofonía, the relevant differences between open e-y-o and closed sounds can be considered such as variants of two separate couples archiphoneme, keeping to the following system-i-, E-, a,-O-, u. See García García, José, El habla de El Franco, p. 119. As is clearly evident by García García, the nasalization of vowels preceding tonic or atonic to ensure –n- in coda \\"tamen\\", or situated between nasal consonants \\"mañá\\". Vowel lengthening occurs as a result by contractions: \\"vou à casa\\" or by compensation as a result of the loss of intervocalic nasal \\"machacan a 'llá/lá\\", \\"Que mañá' nos traiga un bó día de solín\\". See García García, José, El habla de El Franco, p. 34. The extension is also in the case of concomitant vowels, like in the proverb \\"A terra que da á ortiga\\". ==Diphthongs== * Falling diphthong: 'couto', 'souto', 'cantou', 'deitou', 'cantei'... * Anticipation of the \\"yod\\", like: 'naide', 'coiro', 'agoiro', 'cadeira'... * No nasal diphthong at the end, as noted by Menendez Garcia as one of the benchmark isoglosses the speeches and Asturleonesas Galaicas. See Menéndez García, \\"Algunos límites dialectales para el occidente de Asturias\\", IDEA 1.951 nº 14 Semivowels * Unlike Galician-Portuguese and Portuguese, Eonavian, like Galician, tends to the abolition of semiconsonants, but it has evolved its own way, linked to treatment of nasality, such as the relative articles ‘condo’, ‘contó’ or the toponyms 'Sayane' (Saint John) and the names 'Xan'(John, 'Xanón' (Big John) etc… * In Eonaviego, as in the rest of the Galaicofonía, is a tendency to anticipatory assimilation, but today, both Eonaviego and Gallego have a strong influence from Castilian. In both cases, the process does not extend beyond the influence by it: 'naide', 'beizo', 'coiro', 'caldeiro', 'ribeira', etc... Nasal consonants Map about Galician-Portuguese speaking areas taking into account principally the nasality factor. Map based on Fernández Rei's outline, \\"Dialectoloxía da lingua galega\\". * Intervocalic vowels are lost. That fact is the argument of greater weight to those opposed to the theory of Astur-Galician, precisely because there is the curious fact that the phenomenon is accentuated in the municipalities close to the probable Eonaviegos West following a north-south trend is started in Portugal. The fact is manifested in the formation of plurals, on increases in the training of women, but especially in the loss of the nasal-palatal. See Porto Dapena, fonología velar gallega. * The velarization of nasal vowels and deformation from n-falling. Dámaso Alonso, «Engañar, volar, casos y resultados de velariación de –n- en el dominio Gallego». See Damaso Alonso, Engañar, volar, casos y resultados de velariación de –n- en el dominio Gallego. Homenaje a Fr. Krüger, Mendoza II, 1952, pp 210 y ss. * The evolution of group Latin nn > n. * The retention of -mb-. * The group m’l y m’n changes to m * The loss of nasal-palatals, in diminutive feminine, vaquía, cousía, roupía, etc. and some masculines foucío, campío, en el sufijo -ieiro/a: cocieira, dieiro, mulieiro, etc. Lateral consonants * The retention of intervocalic lateral consonants: except in the most western counties, the trend is the maintenance of intervocalic -l, except in the cartulary of Villanueva de Oscos Monastery the tendency to the disappearance of the intervocalic -l- is like the rest of the Galician-Portuguese languages. * The palatalization of the initial lateral and degemination absence of Latin \\"-ll-\\". Now, it occurs inonly half the territory, but the examination of the Cartulary de Oscos confirm that this phenomenon was widespread in all Galician and Asturian counties from the River Eo and the Navia River. (See García Leal, \\"En los Albores del Asturiano (II). «La palatización de la -l- inicial en la documentación latina altomedieval del Reino Astur-leonés», (718-1037). * The velarization of \\"B'D\\" (cold, Dold, etc.), is now a very rare a phenomenon and absent from Huelves Acevedo García, who reported \\"coldo\\" and \\"codo\\", but it was widespread in the Oscos. See Suárez Fernández, Xose Luis, Vocabulario de Mántaras (Tapia) \\"Aportaciois al Lexico Galego-Asturiano\\", Xeira, La Caridad, 1997 Evolution of the Latin groups * The evolution -cl-, -pl- y -fl- to palatal dull sound is agreed about in western Bable and Galician since \\"che vaqueira\\" tends to be more fricative (š) than affricate (ć). * The group -lt-, -ct- and -sc- evolved to it and ix. * The gj, gi, j, nj, li, gl were palatised. * The ss evolved to a palatal, dull fricative. * The gy, -dy-, -sc- evolved to a palatal dull fricative. * Liquid consonants after occlusives changed to vocalic sounds: oculu > òyo, vetulu > vèyo, apicula > abeya, tegula > tèya, flagrare > cheirar, agru > eiro, cathedra > cadèira. Other phenomena * Fricative occlusives became sharper than Asturian, even more than in Galician: 'louxa', 'vixo', 'dexobado', 'xardía', 'broxa', 'xebrar', 'xastre', 'ameixola', 'èixola'. * Palatalization to letter x. * Distinction between palatals, fricatives and laterals. García García proposes the following oppositions: 'callo' ('callar' verb), cayo ('caer' verb), rayo (meteorological phenomenon), rallo ('rallar' verb), etc. * Neutralization of liquid pool, but that phenomenon is on the verge of disappearance. * Retention of Latin -f-. * Geminate ss evolved to a fricative: Latin passaru > Eonavian páxaro, Latin bassare > Eonavian baxar, etc. == Morphology == Verbs * Verbal tenses: indicative present, imperfect, perfect, pluperfect simple, conditional future; subjunctive present and imperfect; Imperative, infinitive simple and conjugate, participle and gerund. * The synthetic future the construction of the future tense is with the phrase verb 'haber' + pronoun + tense infinitive: \\"eiyes atizar\\" u otras \\"eivos dar\\", \\"y'a poñer\\", which are similar to others used in Galician-Portuguese to prioritise the personal pronoun to the desinence ending: atizaryes-ei, darvos-ei, poñerlle-a.This type of construction, although less frequent, can be seen in Old Castilian as well, for example the book of the Cifar Knight, (approx. 1300) «bien se que vos pesa, pero conoçerle-hedes esta vegada mejoría\\". Separable times are documented in Castilian to the 18th century and are still preserved in Judeo- Sephardic; see, for example, Hanssen, Gramática histórica de la lengua castellana, (1913), Paris 1966, § 62. * The conjugated infinitive is used subordinate constructions if the infinitive ends or is part of a prepositional phrase; processes have different subjects and aims to avoid ambiguity. * Like the rest of the family Galician-Portuguese, there is a strong dependence of original vocalism in Latin, and in Galician-Asturian, it is even more conservative. The verbal inflection of Eonavian is conditioned by the loss of the distinction between open and closed vowels in Vulgar Latin. The disappearance of the distinction between unstressed vowels made the mobility of stressed vowels within the verbal root make morpheme prevail over the root in most cases, distinguishing between open and closed position as tonic when it was combined. Thus, the vowels acquired certain metaphonic connotations, to incorporate the distinction into verbal inflection and ignore the etymological origin of the words. The strong personal forms (the three person singular and third plural present indicative, subjunctive and all of the second imperative) are always distinguished by speakers between vowel -e- and open-o and between the strong and weak of forms other than monosyllabic verbs if the stressed vowel of the root morpheme and the match, except for the verbs given duty and irregular in Galician-Asturian. These are the main features of the verb forms in the language: The –des is in the second person plural of every conjugation. García García confirms that although the ending is maintained stably in the second and third conjugations, in the first conjugation, it is giving way to the influence of Castilian -ais and -aides. See, for example, García García, El habla del El Franco, p. 188 The perfect past –che has in the first person singular, ‘veño’, ‘teño’, ‘vexo’. There is a vocal deformation by the rizotónic effect. Infinitive ending in -r- join with pronomes. There is a disappearance of –s- in the first person plural to join ‘nos’ enclitic. The -n- paragogic is in the first person singular perfect in all strong and bending double –er, -ir, dixen-, puxen, fun, salin, còmín. Endings in -i often take -n paragójica: tomein, falein, subirein, falarein, hein, sein. The open -e forms in the first person plural past (coyèmos, dixèmos) or the open o- in second and third person plural (fòmos, fòron). The infinitive in –er- in many verbs in Castillian is in -ir: ‘morrer’, ‘encher’, ‘ferver’, ‘render’, etc., less frequently, the form hesitates: ‘valir’/’valer’ y ‘tosir’/’toser’. An alternation occurs -e- open and closed in verbs with-e-open rizotónica for which the -e- radical of the singular and the third person plural. Foe verbs ending in in-cer, the first person singular present indicative and subjunctive present are treated as ces: ce lluzo, lluce, lluza, lluzas, lluza. There is an alternation between open and closed in the thematic vowel tonic of most verbs in -er. Closed -e- is typical for all persons in the plural of the perfect, six of pluperfect simple, all the imperfect subjunctive in the two series, and forms of the gerund and the first person future, in the first and second person plural present, the plural of the imperative of the first and second person plural of the future, both as in the hypothetical future-e. Verbs (medir and sentir) show an alternation i/e in the root vowel: with -i-in the strong forms (forms in the singular and the third plural of the present, the singular imperative and all of the subjunctive) and -e-in the weak vowels. Western Asturian occurs accentuates the first and second persons of the plural present subjunctive. * Garcia Garcia and Celso Muñiz admit the existence of composite shapes with verb ‘ter’ as an assistant. However, that is more from such an approach particular of the authors on the morphosyntax of the compound forms than as the existence of their own specialty in Eonavian. Nouns * The gender and the number are o/a, os/as. These forms are altered the loss of intervolcalic -n-: ratois (mice), caxois (drawers). * The instability of nasal consonants alters also augmentatives and diminutives: casúa (big house), pedrúa (big stones), casía (small house), pedría (small stone), etc. * It is also characteristic of Eonavian to change gender to specify a group or an unknown number of things: \\"el anada\\", \\"el herba\\", (\\"a herba\\" a blade of grass, \\"el hierba\\", a grass farod) and in adverbial locutions to \\"da feito\\" (in fact), \\"da remoyo\\" (soacking), etc. * Although the forms of gender-neutral are widespread, highlighted by Frías Conde, the use of the forms is from the influence of Castilian, and the forms used to be unknown in Eonavian («Los derivados de \\"ille\\" e \\"illum\\" en el gallego de Asturias», Revista de Filología Románica, nº 10, 1993, pp. 241–252), so it is strange that it is precisely the neutral \\"lo\\", the only article that begins in a consonant, it is beyond question it is that no analyst records the existence of contractions with -lo', something unacceptable in Galician and Asturian. ==Syntax== Pronouns * The Latin vocalism of the first-person pronoun, albeit with different embodiments, is retained: èu/èo. * There is a general extension of prepositional contractions of a similar nature. Contractions of unstressed pronouns, accusative dative are used more: mo, ma, mas, cho, cha, chas, yo, yos, yas. * The accusative and the dative in the personal pronouns are distinguished: the second person is te/che, the third person ye/lo/la. Pronominal form «min» is always a complement with a preposition: a min, por min, de min, etc. * Use of an interest dative: ‘’Eso nun che me gusta nada, vouchéme fer un traxe, llevábachebos un traxe, éche grande, vaiye cansao’’: the pronomes \\"che\\"- and –\\"ye\\"- have a sympathetic or interest value to highlight the attention of the recipient of the action. However, the indirect object lost the condition when it is preceded by the reflexive indirect object. * The lack of reflexive complement.is replaced by different forms: ‘’ye: yo, ya, yos, yas, así: deoyo, llevayo’’, etc. Partitives * Retention of prepositional syntagma partitives (accusative partial) in restrictive clauses or specification of content with transitive verbs. See too «Informe sobre a fala ou gallego asturiano», publicado por la Academia de la Lengua Asturiana en 2006, p. 31; Bechara, Evanildo, Moderna Gramática Portuguesa, 36ª edición, 2003, p. 161; Cidrás Escáneo, Francisco (1998): \\"Marcaxe preposicional do obxecto en galego. Emerxencia e vicisitudes dun proceso de gramaticalización sintáctica\\", in Dieter Kremer (ed.): Homenaxe a Ramón Lorenzo. Vigo: Galaxia, vol II: 569-580). Usually, the phenomenon is caused by simple ellipsis of the nominal forms.

It is very interesting its conservation by the massive information provided a community so small as the Villanueva de Oscos Abbey. The documents show us the vitality of this language in the Middle Ages and give very important information on Romance languages in the northwest of Iberian Peninsula. The Chartulary preserves 616 parchments about the Middle Ages: 32 from the 12th century, 261 from the 13th century, 224 from the 14th century and 99 from the 15th century.Alvárez Castrillón, José Antonio, Colección Diplomática del Monasterio de Santa María de Villanueva de Oscos, Ridea, 2011, p. 33 The first scholar who dealt with its study was Aureliano Fernández-Guerra in 1865, in the very important article «Speech about the Carther of Aviles». He used extracts of 19 documents from 1256 to 1316. In 1868, Martín Sangrador y Vitores included in his work about the Asturias administration a copy in Galician of the royal prerogative given away by Fernando II to the Abbey. The next edition of the documents about monastery had to wait until the mid-20th century, when the Royal Institute of Asturian Studies (RIDEA) edited the article «El convento benedictino de Villanueva de Ozcos»«El convento benedictino de Villanueva de Ozcos» BIDEA nº 22, 1954 by Marcos G. Martínez, a rather poor edition. Only in 1981, Pedro Floriano Llorente publishes in RIDEA «Colección dipolomática de Villanueva de Ozcos», Vid. Floriano LLorente, Pedro, «Colección dipolomática de Villanueva de Ozcos» 1st serial, BIDEA 102, Oviedo, 1981, p. 127-190. which implies an important improvement concerning the previous, both by perfection technical, as by the personal and toponymic references. Nonetheless, the edition dealt with the issue only as far as 1200. In 1994, the Britonia journal published the second serial of the monastery's parchments, edited by Floriano Llorente, covering until the first half of the 13th century. The edition, however, failed to meet the editors' expectations.because no documents were produced in Romance so Britonia published a second version, less known, to covers until 1300, more interesting for the study of the question. The works served as a basis to publish another set of documents by Professor Alvárez Castrillón in his book Los Ozcos en los siglos X-XIII, un modelo de organización social del espacio en la Asturias medieval, (2001), but the work addresses only the historic aspects and not the linguistics. In the following years, Professor Sanz Fuentes has published also four other documents with regard to Buron Hospital. Finally, Alvárez Castrillón, edited, in 2008, 605 more parchments as attachments to the book «La Comarca de los Oscos en la Edad Media, poblamiento, economía y poder», and in 2011, he edited 293 more documents from 1139 to 1300, Colección Diplomática del Monasterio de Santa María de Villanueva de Oscos, (1139-1300). The documents of the chartulary give important information for knowledge of the language spoken in the western Asturias in the Middle Ages. They show the origin and the evolution of this language, but the serial of parchments finishes with the arrival the Congregation of Castile in 1511 at Monastery, the end of a cycle and will be the beginning of a new one, the big economic growth around the iron industry.

He was the author of four songs of moral satire, known as (cántigas de escarnio y maldecir). One of the cántigas relates, in ancient Galician-Portuguese language, to the \\"costumes\\" (manners) and \\"feituras\\" (facts) of the \\"Cavalon\\" (old horse), which tells the adventures of a nobleman who lived in Seville, and had come from Oscos Region in \\"Esturas\\" (Asturias) on the border with Galicia. The verses are included in a \\"cántiga\\" that is within the theme of \\"escarnio\\" (ridicule) and \\"maldecir\\" (cursing) but with the impersonation which is typical of the \\"Cántiga de amigo\\" (friend song). Anyway, it seems that the reference to the knight of Oscos presents allegorical connotations to the origin of the Asturian knight that might be related with the type of speech used in the cantiga. Beltran, Vicenç; Tipos y temas trovadorescos XIII. Fernan Soarez de Quinhones; pp. 394-397. Beltran, Vicenç; La Corte de Babel. Los problemas de Fernán Soarez de Quiñones; pp. 212 After the arrival of the Castillian Congregation at the [monastery of Santa María de Villanueva de Oscos in 1511, the written record of the language ended until its resurgence in the late 19th century. In the early years of the 20th century was an identification with Galician, reflected in authors like Cotarelo Valledor and Antolin Santos Ferraria, who wrote entirely in Galician. Fernandez and Fernandez and Bernardo Acevedo Huelves were the first authors who are aware of the peculiarities of this language. The latest one is usually attributed the first sonnet in this language: \\"Vusté era un gran señor, Eu era un gran probe\\"(You was a great lord, I was a large poor man). A poet contemporary of them was Ramón García González, (1870-1938), who showedthe influence of the modernist spirit, prevailing in the early 20th century. His best-known work is a long poem entitled \\"El xardín\\". Another poet in that time was Villar Conrado Loza (Taramundi 1873-Tapia 1962), who focused on themes around migration, recurring theme in folk literature on the early 20th century. After the Spanish Civil War was a decline of the literature in Asturian Galician, which lost the identity features that were beginning to appear. Folk literature was mixing Galician and Castilian and tended to be anecdotic rather than purely literary. In the 1970s, thanks to the work of authors such as Damaso Alonso, writers of the western end of Asturia began to reaffirm the identity of their language, such as Manuel Garcia Sanchez, known Manolo Galano, particularly concerned about the popular culture of the region and published, in 1994, with Jacinto López Díaz \\"Vocabulario da Roda\\" and had published in 1984: \\"Cuentos Parzamiques\\". He was a frequent contributor to the magazine Entrambasauguas and published, in 2005, a recast of twenty written contributions to the magazine in the book \\"Vento d'outono\\". Beside them are some more recent authors as Xose Miguel Suarez (Mantaras, Tapia, 1965) and Xavier Frias Conde. The writers started their literary careers, from the philological study of the language albeit from very different perspectives. The difficulty of publishing books for an audience so small makes it most remarkable of all that the literature projects through various magazines of the region. The oldest magazine is \\"A Freita\\", which appeared in eleven numbers, a general magazine that started to being published in 1992. Among its contributors were writers like Benigno Fernandez Braña, Xan Castañeira, Xosé Maximo Fernandez Muniz, Adela Valledor Conde, etc. In 1995, the magazine attached a literary supplement, published to makes noticed to the authors of Eonavia in other formats, through a kind of less formal book. See, for example, Frías Conde, FJ; «Nos confíns da literatura galega: escritores asturianos en galego»; Revista de lenguas y literaturas catalana, gallega y vasca, number 5, 1996‑1997 pp. 223-240 Since 1996, the Department of Linguistics of Eo Navia has published the magazine \\"Entrabasauguas\\". Among the writers often to collaborating are Veiguela Crisanto (Vegadeo 1959), Alejandro Blanco Antunez, (Navia 1933), Teresa Lopez, (Boal 1950), Xoxe Carlos Alvarez Blanco, Xavier Vilareyo (Mieres 1967), Fredo de Carbexe (El Franco 1967), etc. In theatre, there is some tradition like in Villar and Manuel Galano. Lately, old plays have been recovered: \\"Condo el cariño è de Verdá\\", a comedy released in 1936 by Association Armal, and \\"El tratto de FF Arias\\", premiered in Figueras in 1926. ==Associations== In the dialectal area are associations supporting each side, such as Asociación Abertal (defending the Galician theory) and Xeira or Fala Viva (defending the Asturian theory). Its protection and language policy are the responsibility of the Asturian government and the Secretaría Llingüística del Navia-Eo, a division of the Academia de la Llingua Asturiana responsible for the area. There are two different orthographies for Eonavian, the official one (more Asturian-like) as well as one made by the Mesa prá Defensa del Galego de Asturias (more Galician-like). ==See also== *Iberian languages ==NotesExternal links== * Eonavian grammar (Galician theory) * Mesa for the defense of Gallego de Asturias (defending the Galician theory) * Xeira (defending the Asturian theory) Category:Galician language Category:Asturian language ","title":"Galician-Asturian"},{"id":"5560266","text":"Michael Bruce McKenzie (born 3 July 1967) is an Australian former long- distance freestyle swimmer who represented Australia at the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul, South Korea.

Illustrated Interviews: No. IV – Mr. W. S. Gilbert\\", The Strand Magazine, Vol. 2, October 1891, pp. 330–41, reprinted at The Gilbert and Sullivan Archive, 20 November 2011 is the name of a house and estate in Harrow Weald, in northwest London, England. The house was built from 1870 to 1872 by Richard Norman Shaw for painter Frederick Goodall and named after the nearby prehistoric earthwork known as Grim's Ditch. It was converted into a hotel, Grim's Dyke Hotel, in 1970 The house is best known as the home of the dramatist W. S. Gilbert, of the opera partnership Gilbert and Sullivan, who lived and farmed there for the last two decades of his life. He died while attempting to save a girl from drowning in his lake. Lady Gilbert and the Gilberts' ward, Nancy McIntosh, lived there until her death in 1936. The statue of Charles II now found in Soho Square stood on the property from about 1880 to 1938. The house was then used as a rehabilitation centre until 1963. From 1963, the house was used mainly as a location for films and television, including Futtocks End and The Avengers. Since its conversion into a hotel, the house continues to be used as a film location. The hotel leases 30 of the original 110 acres of land that Gilbert purchased with the house. ==History== Grim's Dyke from the dyke in 1881 The house was designed in 1870 by Richard Norman Shaw for the Victorian era painter Frederick Goodall, who had purchased of landAinger, p. 320 at Harrow Weald in 1856, but he did not begin to build until a lease on the property expired. Shaw's design for the house included aspects of Gothic revivalism, added to a late-Elizabethan style, which included high red-tiled gables, tall clustered chimneys and leaded lights. To the north of the house, Shaw built a small lodge, a walled garden and various outhouses and a stable block, later converted into garages by W. S. Gilbert for his collection of motorcars.Goodman (Grim's Dyke), p. 6 Over the dyke (now a duck pond) Shaw built two stone bridges, which incorporated flint from the ruined church at Stanmore.Coincidentally, Gilbert's ashes were buried in the churchyard of this church after his death in 1911. Construction on the house was completed in 1872. Goodall's ground-floor studio was built on a north-south axis in order to catch the light. Goodall sold the property in 1880 to Robert Herriot of Hambros Bank, who added a billiard room in 1883.Goodman (Grim's Dyke), p. 7 Windsor Castle is visible from the house. Gilbert in his library in 1891 W. S. Gilbert purchased the property in August 1890 for £4,000.Stedman, p. 278. He made various additions and alterations to the property, including an elaborate fireplace of Cornish alabaster in Goodall's studio, which became Gilbert's drawing/music room. At the house, Gilbert wrote his last ten works from an armchair in his library overlooking the croquet lawn.Goodman (Grim's Dyke), p. 12 Gilbert also had an observatory for stargazing. Arthur Sullivan visited Grim's Dyke with his nephew, Herbert, on 27 May 1893.Wolfson, John. Final Curtain: The Last Gilbert and Sullivan Operas, Chappell in association with A. Deutsch, London (1976) p. 28 They stayed at the house for three days while Sullivan worked with Gilbert to finalise Utopia, Limited.Goodman (Grim's Dyke), p. 17 At the house, Gilbert had a vinery, apiary, orchards and a farm, with Jersey cattle, horses, pigs and fowl. He also kept a variety of exotic animals including monkeys, lemurs, a lynx and many others.McIntosh, Nancy. \\"The Late Sir W. S. Gilbert's Pets\\", Country Life, 3 June 1911, reprinted in W. S.

The house was acquired jointly by the Middlesex County Council and the London County Council, who leased it to the North West Regional Hospital Board from 1937 to 1962, at first as a rehabilitation centre for women suffering from tuberculosis (the house was used by the services during the World War II).Goodman, Andrew. History, Grimsdyke.com, accessed 26 March 2014 Following the war, both sexes were admitted,Goodman, Andrew. Gilbert and Sullivan's London, Hippocrene Books (1988) and from 1948 only male patients were admitted. From 1963, the house was used primarily as a location for films and television, including Futtock's End with Ronnie Barker. It was converted into a hotel in 1970. It was featured in John Betjeman's acclaimed television documentary Metro-Land (1973). The hotel was seen in an off set episode of EastEnders in 2003. The house and its gatehouse are both listed buildings. Harrow Council owns the building and the remaining 30 acres of the estate and has leased them to the hotel since 1970. The hotel and estate were refurbished in 1996 at a cost of £3 million. Presentations of Gilbert and Sullivan operas and other entertainments are regularly held. The remainder of the lands have been separated from the hotel and were sold by Harrow Council as \\"Grimsdyke Farm\\".\\"Gilbert and Sullivan estate up for grabs\\", Reed Business Information Ltd, 20 January 2010 The name Grim's Dyke is sometimes used to refer to a nearby earthwork known as Grim's Ditch which runs from Pinner Hill to Bentley Priory. ==Statue of Charles II== The statue of Charles II in the lake in 1891 A statue of Charles II was carved by Danish sculptor Caius Gabriel Cibber in 1681 and placed at the centre of Soho Square in London. By the early 19th century, the statue was described as being 'in a most wretched mutilated state; and the inscriptions on the base of the pedestal quite illegible'.\\"Soho Square Area: Portland Estate: Soho Square Garden\\" in Survey of London volumes 33 and 34 (1966) St Anne Soho, pp. 51-53. Date accessed: 12 January 2008. In 1875, the statue was removed during alterations in the square by T. Blackwell, of Crosse and Blackwell, the venerable canned and bottled foodstuffs firm, who gave it for safekeeping to his friend, Goodall, with the intention that it might be restored. Goodall placed the statue on an island in his lake at Grim's Dyke, where it remained while Gilbert owned the property. In her will, Lady Gilbert directed that the statue be returned, and it was restored to Soho Square in 1938.Minogue, Tim. Soho farewell then\\" . SBAP.org, 2009, accessed 2 June 2011 ==Gilbert's lake and death== The lake, which is some way from the house, beyond the ornamental gardens, was considerably extended by Gilbert during his time at Grim's Dyke. Work on digging out the lake began in 1899, with Gilbert himself assisting in the task. Eventually it covered about one and a half acres, with an island in the middle, a punt house and changing hut, and an artificial waterfall that was ceremonially turned on in December 1899. The lake was drained and refilled each year, to keep the water clear, and was stocked with trout.Goodman (Grim's Dyke), p. 14 In 1905 the lake was extended again to a roughly rectangular shape, measuring 170 yards by 50 yards. When Gilbert lived at Grim's Dyke he swam in the lake every day from March to September. Gilbert's Lake in 1899 On 29 May 1911 Gilbert had arranged to give a swimming lesson in the lake to two local girls,Crowther, Andrew. The Life of W. S.

In 1923, Winifred Isabel Emery related to Gilbert's biographers her recollection of what happened on that day: > Sir William Gilbert was teaching me to swim, and he invited me and a pupil > of mine [Ruby Preece] to Grim's Dyke on May 29th. We met him at Harrow > Station and motored to Grim's Dyke and went straight to the bathing pool. My > pupil and I were in the water before Sir William had made an appearance. It > was a very hot day, but the water struck very cold. My pupil was a much > better swimmer than I, and soon outdistanced me. We were both unaware that > the lake was very deep further out, and presently she shrieked out \\"Oh, Miss > Emery, I am drowning!\\" I called Sir William, who was on the steps, and he > called out to her not to be frightened, and that he was coming. He swam out > to her very quickly, and I heard him say: \\"Put your hands on my shoulder and > don't struggle.\\" This she did, but almost immediately she called out that he > had sunk under her and had not come up. We both called to him, but got no > answer. I tried to reach them, but got out of my depth and could do nothing > but call for help. My pupil managed to struggle to the bank, and presently > the gardener came and got out a boat, but it seemed a long time before they > recovered the body. The lake, seen on 29 May 2011 At the coroner's inquest, Preece stated, \\"I found that I could not stand and called out and Sir William swam to me. I put my hand on his shoulder and I felt him suddenly sink. I thought he would come up again. My feet were on the mud then. Miss Emery called for help and the gardeners came with the boat.\\" Gilbert had \\"died instantly of the heart attack\\".Stedman, p. 346 Once his body was recovered, it was laid out in the billiard room (now the hotel's restaurant) at Grim's Dyke.Eden, D. J., W.S. Gilbert – Appearance and Reality, Sir Arthur Sullivan Society (2003), p. 111 The family doctor, W.W. Shackleton, and Daniel Wilson of Bushey Heath Cottage Hospital, later certified that Gilbert had died at about 4.20 pm that afternoon of syncope (heart failure) brought on by excessive exertion. The coroner's jury, also meeting in the billiard room at Grim's Dyke two days later, on 31 May 1911, recorded a verdict of accidental death. Shortly thereafter, Lady Gilbert had the lake closed off and largely drained.Goodman (Grim's Dyke), pp. 17–18 The incident is described in the documentary Metro- Land. Over the century since then, silt has built up in the mostly drained lake and trees and other vegetation have grown, dividing the lake into smaller ponds.

At the age of 15 he joined the army, serving first in Italy until 1567, and then moving to Flanders. In 1580 he was called back to Madrid by his official duties. King Philip II, seeing his military record, awarded him a knighthood in the Order of Santiago and sent him on a campaign against Portugal. However, at that time news arrived from Chile, where the Arauco War continued and reinforcements were needed. The king subsequently decided to name Sotomayor governor of the district and send him there with a large contingent of soldiers to resolve the situation. ==Governor of Chile== Sotomayor arrived in Chile in 1583 and found himself required to play the role of judge, hearing innumerable accusations against the previous governor Martín Ruiz de Gamboa. This previous governor had become extremely unpopular for a tax regime, the Tasa de Gamboa, which prohibited the payment of taxes by the Indians in the form of labor. Sotomayor was forced to arrest and imprison Gamboa in the government house at Santiago, from which he was released only after providing a bond. However, Sotomayor later absolved Gamboa and freed him entirely. With these antecedents, Sotomayor's first decision was reestablishing the old system of labor levies, abolishing the Tasa de Gamboa and reinstituting the previous Tasa de Santillán, albeit with provisions to humanize the old system, with the goal of avoiding the excesses of the encomenderos against the Indians. The Arauco war Sotomayor wanted to extend the conquest of Chile in the style of Pedro de Valdivia, which is to say, by building a series of forts which would protect each other and the cities. However, carrying out this project required a professional army, and requests for such were turned down by the Spanish authorities, due to the general scarcity of resources in the area and of the Crown. Ruiz de Gamboa, Bravo de Saravia and Sotomayor Instead he launched a number of campaigns against the resisting Mapuche Indians. He succeeded in capturing the mestizo Alonso Díaz, who had been a resistance leader for many years. Sotomayor sent his brother Luis to fight a campaign in the area around Valdivia, and succeeded in defeating the Mapuches in a surprise attack at Angol on January 16, 1585. Sotomayor also put in action his plan of fortifications with the few men that he had. In 1584, he founded the fort of San Fabián de Conueo in Coelemu. In 1585 he ordered the construction of the fort Santo Arbol de la Cruz where the Guaqui River enters the Bio Bio River. He ordered the construction of a fort on each side of the Bio Bio River, the forts Espíritu Santo and Santísima Trinidad and another at a place in Catirai called San Jerónimo de Millapoa and raised another fort at Purén, where he also placed a small detachment. He raised these forts with the goal of cutting communications among the Mapuches and hoped to quickly establish towns in each of these places, which would attract enough people to bring reinforcements to Chile persuaded that this was the best method of reducing the tribes for the definitive conquest. The Mapuche Toquis Nongoniel, Cadeguala and Guanoalca opposed the establishment of these forts, eventually forcing the abandonment of Purén in 1586. In 1589 Sotomayor reoccupied and expanded the fort of Puren and built a fort near the sea on the heights of Marihueñu and in 1590 he moved Arauco to its current location close to the sea. However, his actions did not really weaken the Mapuches. The capture of Diaz didn't change the situation, and the establishment of the forts did not have any of their intended consequences. Instead, the Aracanians were every day better aqainted with the Spanish horses and weapons. The arquebus was their only problem, as they did not know how to use it and in any case did not have any source of gunpowder. Problems of the government Amidst these problems with the insurgency, Sotomayor also had to confront the attacks of English pirates, most notably Thomas Cavendish, who anchored in Quintero on April 9, 1587. There he was defeated by the Spanish, losing 10 men. Additionally, he had to deal with revolts by soldiers in the south, motivated by the poverty that they suffered on account of not being paid in either gold or encomienda rights. Alarmed by the situation and by the lack of reinforcements, Sotomayor went to Peru on July 30, 1592 to petition the viceroy there for more men. He left the old and circumspect lawyer Pedro de Viscarra, who had arrived from Spain two years earlier with the title of lieutenant governor of Chile. ==Governor of Panama== In August, Sotomayor disembarked in Callao, where he learned that the king had named a new governor of Chile, Martín García Óñez de Loyola. He returned to Chile to testify about and defend his actions, a tribunal from which he emerged triumphant. He then headed towards Spain, but was detained on the road by the Viceroy of Peru, who asked him to take charge of the province of Panama, then menaced by English invasion. ==Later life== Upon his return to Spain he was again named governor of Chile in 1604. However, due to his bitter frustrations there he declined the post. He joined the Council of the Indies and in 1609 and was charged with the expulsion of the Moriscos from Spain. ==Additional information== Sources *Pedro Mariño de Lobera.

The term is also used as a place where logs were collected into booms, as at the mouth of a river. With several firms driving on the same stream, it was necessary to direct the logs to their owner's respective booms, with each log identified by its own patented timber mark. One of the most well known logbooms was in Williamsport, Pennsylvania, along the Susquehanna River. The development and completion of that specific log boom in 1851 made Williamsport the \\"Lumber Capital of the World\\". As the logs proceeded downstream, they encountered these booms in a manner that allowed log drivers to control their progress, eventually guiding them to the river mouth or sawmills. Most importantly, the booms could be towed across lakes, like rafts, or anchored while individual logs awaited their turn to go through the mill. Booms prevented the escape into open waters of these valuable assets. Log boom foundations were commonly constructed of piles or large stones placed into cribs in a river to form small islands. The booms were themselves large floating logs linked together end to end, like a large floating chain connecting the foundations while strategically guiding the transported logs along their path. Large blocks of ice commonly threaten booms, pushing free-flowing logs over the structures. Significantly large chunks of ice can even gain enough power so as to break through the boom altogether, freeing the logs and endangering unsuspecting people and wildlife located downstream. Moreover, flooding and the changing of the seasons fluctuate water levels, occasionally causing jams that can extend for miles on end.Professor Jason Hall, \\"Rivers, International Conflicts and Cooperation\\", Rivers in World History lecture, St. Thomas University, 7 May 2015. Log booms were used in the United States and British North America throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries. During the largely bloodless Aroostook War that centred on the disputed border between Maine and New Brunswick, hastily built booms proved pricy for local governments. The 1,300-foot-long Aroostook Boom, made of confiscated timber and containing seven piers, cost the state of Maine more than $15,000 to construct. Licensed loggers commonly sent their wood in easily manageable raft units, but illegal lumbermen cunningly sent loose timber, complicating the sorting process and angering officials. Booms often caused friction between the disputing governments; when political tensions intensified, loggers and soldiers targeted enemy booms with arms and explosives.Richard and Patricia Judd, \\"Forging an International Economy: The Aroostook War and Its Aftermath\\", in Aroostook: A Century of Logging in Northern Maine (Orono: University of Maine Press, 1988),33-35. ==See also== * Boom (navigational barrier) * Timber rafting == References External links== *Moving Logs on Big River Category:Log transport ru:Бон (техника) ","title":"Log boom"},{"id":"5560362","text":"The Coal Question; An Inquiry Concerning the Progress of the Nation, and the Probable Exhaustion of Our Coal Mines is a book that economist William Stanley Jevons wrote in 1865 to explore the implications of Britain's reliance on coal.See via Google BooksSee via Google Books Given that coal was a finite, non-renewable energy resource, Jevons raised the question of sustainability. \\"Are we wise,\\" he asked rhetorically, \\"in allowing the commerce of this country to rise beyond the point at which we can long maintain it?\\" His central thesis was that the supremacy of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland over global affairs was transitory, given the finite nature of its primary energy resource. In propounding this thesis, Jevons covered a range of issues central to sustainability, including limits to growth, overpopulation, overshoot, energy return on energy input (EROEI), taxation of energy resources, renewable energy alternatives, and resource peakinga subject widely discussed today under the rubric of peak oil. ==The significance of coal== Jevons introduces the first chapter of The Coal Question with a succinct description of coal's wonders and of society's insatiable appetite for it: > \\"Coal in truth stands not beside but entirely above all other commodities. > It is the material energy of the country — the universal aid — the factor in > everything we do. With coal almost any feat is possible or easy; without it > we are thrown back into the laborious poverty of early times. With such > facts familiarly before us, it can be no matter of surprise that year by > year we make larger draughts upon a material of such myriad qualities — of > such miraculous powers.\\" > \\"...new applications of coal are of an unlimited character. In the command > of force, molecular and mechanical, we have the key to all the infinite > varieties of change in place or kind of which nature is capable. No chemical > or mechanical operation, perhaps, is quite impossible to us, and invention > consists in discovering those which are useful and commercially > practicable....\\" Jevons further argues that coal is the source of the UK's prosperity and global dominance. ==Limits to growth and resource peaking== Jevons' graph extrapolating to 1970 the exponential growth of coal production. Because coal was not unlimited, because its access became more difficult with time, and because the demand grew exponentially, Jevons argued that limits or boundaries to prosperity would appear sooner than was generally realized: > \\"I must point out the painful fact that such a rate of growth will before > long render our consumption of coal comparable with the total supply. In the > increasing depth and difficulty of coal mining we shall meet that vague, but > inevitable boundary that will stop our progress.\\" In Jevons' day, British geologists were estimating that the country had coal reserves of 90 billion tons. Jevons believed that extraction of much of this amount would prove to be uneconomical. But, even if the entire quantity could be extracted, Jevons argued, exponential economic growth could not continue unabated. Using historical production estimates, Jevons showed that for the previous 80 years production had grown at a relatively consistent rate of 3.5% per year, or 41% per decade. If this growth rate were to continue, production would grow from approximately 100 million tons in 1865 to more than 2.6 billion tons in 100 years. Jevons then calculated that, in that case, the country would produce approximately 100 billion tons within that period.\\\\int_{0}^{110} 82.17 (1.035)^t\\\\, dt In short, resources were not sufficient for even 100 years, and long before the 100 years point, the growth rate, which was the measure of prosperity, would have to decline. At some point, production would simply hit a peak, which itself meant dire consequences: > \\"Suppose our progress to be checked within half a century, yet by that time > our consumption will probably be three or four times what it now is; there > is nothing impossible or improbable in this; it is a moderate supposition, > considering that our consumption has increased eight-fold in the last sixty > years. But how shortened and darkened will the prospects of the country > appear, with mines already deep, fuel dear, and yet a high rate of > consumption to keep up if we are not to retrograde.\\" Even before the peak was reached, high extraction costs could cause the UK to lose the competitive advantage it currently enjoyed in manufacturing and shipping. British coal production did in fact peak in 1913, but at 292 million tons, about half the amount Jevons' extrapolation suggested. Just under a third of this was exported. Since then, production has dropped to less than 20 million tons. Current UK resources are estimated at about 400 million tons.2007 Annual Report of the UK Coal Authority. ==Population and the \\"Malthus Doctrine\\"== According to Jevons, coal depletion had serious ramifications for population growth. The population of the UK had increased by more than 10% each decade for the prior 70 years, not surprising given that coal production was growing at 40% per decade, meaning that the per capita wealth was growing. > \\"For the present our cheap supplies of coal, and our skill in its > employment, and the freedom of our commerce with other wide lands, render us > independent of the limited agricultural area of these islands, and take us > out of the scope of Malthus' doctrine. We are growing rich and numerous upon > a source of wealth of which the fertility does not yet apparently decrease > with our demands upon it. Hence the uniform and extraordinary rate of growth > which this country presents. We are like settlers spreading in a rich new > country of which the boundaries are yet unknown and unfelt.\\" However, as the growth in coal production slowed, the population growth might easily surpass the production growth, leading to a drop in living conditions: > \\"Now population, when it grows, moves with a certain uniform impetus, like a > body in motion; and uniform progress of population, as I have fully > explained before, is multiplication in a uniform ratio. But long-continued > progress in such a manner is altogether impossible — it must outstrip all > physical conditions and bounds; and the longer it continues, the more > severely must the ultimate check be felt. I do not hesitate to say, > therefore, that the rapid growth of our great towns, gratifying as it is in > the present, is a matter of very serious concern as regards the future.\\" In contrast to Malthus's view that resource growth was linear, Jevons took resource growth as being exponential, like population. This modification of Malthus's theory did not alter the conclusion that unrestrained population growth would inevitably surpass the nation's ability to expand its resources. Prosperity, in terms of per capita consumption, would therefore fall. Moreover, because the primary resource was non-renewable, the fall would be more dramatic than Malthus envisioned: > A farm, however far pushed, will under proper cultivation continue to yield > forever a constant crop. But in a mine there is no reproduction, and the > produce once pushed to the utmost will soon begin to fail and sink towards > zero. So far then as our wealth and progress depend upon the superior > command of coal we must not only stop—we must go back. ==The Jevons Paradox== Given that energy depletion posed long-term dangers for society, Jevons analyzed possible mitigation measures. In so doing, he considered the phenomenon that has come to be known as Jevons paradox. As he wrote: > \\" It is wholly a confusion of ideas to suppose that the economical use of > fuel is equivalent to a diminished consumption. The very contrary is the > truth.\\" Jevons described the historical development of engine technology and argued that the great increase in the UK's consumption of coal was due to the efficiency (or \\"economy\\") brought about by technological innovations, with particular credit going to James Watt's 1776 invention of the steam engine. Like many innovations that followed, such as improved methods for smelting iron, greater economy broadened usage and led to increased energy consumption. > \\"Whatever, therefore, conduces to increase the efficiency of coal, and to > diminish the cost of its use, directly tends to augment the value of the > steam-engine, and to enlarge the field of its operations.\\" Jevons also considered and rejected other measures that might reduce consumption, such as coal taxes and export restrictions. Similarly, although he deplored the wasteful practice of burning away low quality coal at the mine site, he did not support conservation legislation. An alternative that he did consider practical was tightened government fiscal policy, based on using tax revenue to reduce the national debt. Tightened fiscal policy would have the effect of slowing economic growth, thereby slowing coal consumption, at least until the debt was erased. Still, Jevons admitted that the overall impact of such a measure, even if it were implemented, would be minimal. In short, the prospect that society would voluntarily reduce consumption was dim. ==Energy alternatives== Jevons considered the feasibility of alternative energy sources, foreshadowing modern debates on the subject. Regarding wind and tidal forces, he explained that such sources of intermittent power could be made more useful if the energy were stored, for example by pumping water to a height for subsequent use as hydro power. He reviewed biomass, namely timber, and commented that forests covering all of the UK could not supply energy equal to the current coal production. He also mentioned possibilities for geothermal and solar power, pointing out that if these sources did become useful, the UK would lose its competitive advantages in global industry. He was not aware of the future importance of natural gas or petroleum as prime energy sources since they were developed after his book was published. Regarding electricity, which he pointed out was not an energy source but a means of energy distribution, Jevons noted that hydroelectric power was feasible but that reservoirs would face the problem of silt build-up. He discounted hydrogen generation as a means of electricity storage and distribution, calculating that the energy density of hydrogen would never make it practical. He predicted that steam would remain the most efficient means of generating electricity. ==Social responsibility in time of prosperity== Jevons held that despite the desirability of reducing coal consumption, the outlook for implementing significant constraints was dim. Still, the UK's prosperity should at least be seen as imposing responsibilities on the current generation. In particular, Jevons proposed applying the current wealth to righting social ills and to creating a more just society: > \\"We must begin to allow that we can do today what we cannot so well do > tomorrow.... > \\"Reflection will show that we ought not to think of interfering with the > free use of the material wealth which Providence has placed at our disposal, > but that our duties wholly consist in the earnest and wise application of > it. We may spend it on the one hand in increased luxury and ostentation and > corruption, and we shall be blamed. We may spend it on the other hand in > raising the social and moral condition of the people, and in reducing the > burdens of future generations. Even if our successors be less happily placed > than ourselves they will not then blame us.\\"Jevons, W. Stanley, The Coal > Question, 2nd revised edition, 1866, Macmillan and Co., page xxv Jevons also articulated several social ills that particularly concerned him: > \\"The ignorance, improvidence, and brutish drunkenness of our lower working > classes must be dispelled by a general system of education, which may effect > for a future generation what is hopeless for the present generation. One > preparatory and indispensable measure, however, is a far more general > restriction on the employment of children in manufacture. At present it may > almost be said to be profitable to breed little slaves and put them to > labour early, so as to get earnings out of them before they have a will of > their own. A worse premium upon improvidence and future wretchedness could > not be imagined.\\" ==Global developments after Jevons== As Jevons predicted, coal production could not grow exponentially forever. UK production peaked in 1913, and the country lost its global superiority to a new giant of energy production, the United States, a turn of events that was also predicted by Jevons. The UK had by then developed oil resources in the Middle East and increasingly used the fuel for power generation. Although UK production could not continue to grow at the annual rate of 3.5%, the world's fossil fuel consumption did grow at this rate until about 1970. According to Jevons, UK coal production in 1865 was estimated as being equal to production in the rest of the world, giving a rough world estimate of 200 million tons. According to the US Department of Energy, global fossil fuel consumption in 1970 was 200 Quad BTU, or 7.2 billion tons coal equivalent.World Primary Energy Production by Source, 1970-2004 Thus, consumption grew by a factor of 36, representing average annual exponential growth over 105 years of about 3.4%.\\\\sqrt[105]{36}-1=3.4\\\\% In the 34 subsequent years, to 2004, consumption grew by a factor of 2.1, or 2.2% per year, an indication, according to organizations such as ASPO that global energy resources are thinning.\\\\sqrt[34]{2.1}-1=2.2\\\\% The quantity of the world's remaining energy resources is a matter of dispute and serious concern. Between 2005 and 2007, despite the trebling of oil prices, oil production remained relatively flat,December 2007 International Petroleum Monthly a sign according to many that oil production has peaked.see http://www.simmonsco-intl.com/files/AnotherNailintheCoffin.pdf Studies by Dave Rutledge of the California Institute of Technology, and by the Energy Watch Group of GermanyEnergy Watch Group Reports indicate that global coal production will also peak within the current generation, perhaps as soon as 2030. A parallel study by the Energy Watch Group also indicates the limited supply of uranium; this report states that like UK coal production 200 years ago, the production of uranium has first targeted high quality ores, and remaining sources are less dense and more difficult to access. Fetter states that at least 230 years of proven uranium reserves are available at present worldwide rates of consumption, and using uranium extraction from seawater, up to 60,000 years of uranium are available. Further, using advanced breeder reactors and nuclear reprocessing, the 230 years of proven uranium reserves may be extended up to 30,000 years; similar gains are achievable from the 60,000 years of uranium reserves from seawater. ==See also== * Coal phase out * Thomas Malthus * The Limits to Growth *UK environmental law *UK enterprise law ==ReferencesSources== * Malthus, An Essay On The Principle Of Population (1798 1st edition) with A Summary View (1830), and Introduction by Professor Antony Flew.

Drug houses shelter drug users and provide a place to deal to them (making the house a trap house, where the term \\"trap\\" refers to a place to deal drugs). Drug houses are also used as laboratories to synthesize (cook) drugs, as caches of precursors and products, and to conceal illegal cultivation. Drug houses have been a subject widely used in hip hop and trap music. ==United States== In the 1980s, US inner city neighborhoods were subject to a number of forces and withdrawal of city services such as garbage collection. Police and fire protection of the housing stock in these areas dwindled both in size and quality. In areas such as West Baltimore, South Baltimore, North Philadelphia, West Philadelphia, the South Bronx, Brownsville, Brooklyn, South Jamaica, Queens and Flushing, Queens, thousands of fires left entire blocks blighted. City agencies picked these same neighborhoods as sites for drug rehabilitation centers, homeless shelters, and public housing, leading to an increase in the proportion of poor and needy people in areas with dwindling middle-class populations. The strongest industry in some neighborhoods became the illegal drug trade, much to the chagrin of the few remaining community organizations. Abandoned buildings ravaged by arson or neglect formed perfect outposts for drug dealers since they were free, obscure, secluded and there would be no paper trail in the form of rent receipts. The sale of illegal drugs drew other kinds of violent crime to these neighborhoods, further exacerbating the exodus of residents. In some cases enraged citizens have burned crack houses to the ground, in hopes that by destroying the sites for drug operations they might also drive the problematic illegal industries from their neighborhoods. Many major American inner cities contain crack houses. ==United Kingdom== Strong legislation in England and Wales provides a mechanism for police and local authorities to close crack houses which have been associated with disorder or serious nuisance.Anti-Social Behaviour Act 2003, s.2(3)(b)Cumbria Constabulary v Wright (2006) EWHC 3574 (Admin); [2007] 1 WLR 1407 Often, these crack houses have been found in social housing, which has been taken over by drug dealers and users. Laws such as the crack house closure order were designed to disrupt Class A drug dealing and anecdotal evidence suggests that it mainly affects socially housed tenants. The effect is that once an order is made, the premises are boarded up, and no one may enter the premises, initially for a period of three months, but this can be extended to six months on the application of the police. ==Popular culture== * Crack House *Spike Lee's film Jungle Fever (the Taj Mahal sequence) * Various trap houses can be seen in the Breaking Bad TV show.

These can form a plaque that can lead to atherosclerosis and trigger heart attacks and stroke. Foam cells are fat-laden M2 macrophages containing low density lipoproteins (LDL). They can only be truly detected by examining a fatty plaque under a microscope after it is removed from the body. They are named because the lipoproteins give the cell a foamy appearance. Despite the connection with cardiovascular diseases they are not inherently dangerous. ==Formation== Foam cell formation is triggered by a number of factors including the uncontrolled uptake of modified low density lipoproteins (LDL), the upregulation of cholesterol esterification and the impairment of mechanisms associated with cholesterol release. Foam cells are formed when circulating monocyte-derived cells are recruited to the atherosclerotic lesion site or fat deposits in the blood vessel walls. Recruitment is facilitated by the molecules P-selectin and E-selectin, intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) and vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1). Monocytes are then able to penetrate the arterial wall as a result of impaired endothelial integrity which increases permeability. Once in the sub endothelium space, inflammation processes induce the differentiation of monocytes into mature macrophages. Macrophages are then able to internalize modified lipoproteins like βVLDL (beta very low density lipoprotein), AcLDL (acetylated low density lipoprotein) and OxLDL (oxidized low density lipoprotein) through their binding to the scavenger receptors (SRs) such as CD36 and SR-A on the macrophage surface. These scavenger receptors act as \\"Pattern recognition receptors\\" (PRR's) on macrophages and are responsible for recognizing and binding to oxLDL, which in turn promotes the formation of foam cells through internalization of these lipoproteins. Coated-pit endocytosis, phagocytosis and pinocytosis are also responsible for lipoprotein internalization. Once internalized, scavenged lipoproteins are transported to endosomes or lysosomes for degradation, whereby the cholesteryl esters (CE) are hydrolyzed to unesterified free cholesterol (FC) by lysosomal acid lipase (LPL). Free cholesterol is transported to the endoplasmic reticulum where it is re- esterified by ACAT1 (acyl-CoA: cholesterol acyltransferase 1) and subsequently stored as cytoplasmic liquid droplets. These droplets are responsible for the foamy appearance of the macrophage and thus the name of foam cells. At this point, foam cells can either be degraded though the de-esterification and secretion of cholesterol, or can further promote foam cell development and plaque formation – a process that is dependent on the balance of free cholesterol and esterified cholesterol. ==Composition== Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (LDL-C — also known as “bad” cholesterol) and particularly modified forms of LDL cholesterol such as oxidized, glycated, or acetylated LDL, is contained by a foam cell - a marker of atherosclerosis. The uptake of LDL-C alone does not cause foam cell formation; however, the co- internalization of LDL-C with modified LDL in macrophages can result in foam cell development. Modified LDL affects the intracellular trafficking and metabolism of native LDL, such that not all LDL need to be modified for foam cell formation when LDL levels are high. The maintenance of foam cells and the subsequent progression of plaque build-up is caused by the secretion of chemokines and cytokines from macrophages and foam cells. Foam cells secrete pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukins: IL-1, IL-6; tumour necrosis factor (TNF); chemokines: chemokines ligand 2, CCL5, CXC-chemokine ligand 1 (CXCL1); as well as macrophage retention factors. Macrophages within the atherosclerotic legion area have a decreased ability to migrate, which further promotes plaque formation as they are able to secrete cytokines, chemokines, reactive oxygen species (ROS) and growth factors that stimulate modified lipoprotein uptake and vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) proliferation. VSMC can also accumulate cholesteryl esters. In chronic hyperlipidemia, lipoproteins aggregate within the intima of blood vessels and become oxidized by the action of oxygen free radicals generated either by macrophages or endothelial cells. The macrophages engulf oxidized low-density lipoproteins (LDLs) by endocytosis via scavenger receptors, which are distinct from LDL receptors. The oxidized LDL accumulates in the macrophages and other phagocytes, which are then known as foam cells.Kumar, Abbas; Fausto, Aster (2010). \\"11\\". Robbins and Cotran: Pathologic Basis of Disease (Eighth Edition International ed.). Philadelphia: Saunders Elsevier. pp. 500–501. . Foam cells form the fatty streaks of the plaques of atheroma in the tunica intima of arteries. Foam cells are not dangerous as such, but can become a problem when they accumulate at particular foci thus creating a necrotic centre of atherosclerosis. If the fibrous cap that prevents the necrotic centre from spilling into the lumen of a vessel ruptures, a thrombus can form which can lead to emboli occluding smaller vessels. The occlusion of small vessels results in ischemia, and contributes to stroke and myocardial infarction, two of the leading causes of cardiovascular-related death. Foam cells are very small in size and can only be truly detected by examining a fatty plaque under a microscope after it is removed from the body, or more specifically from the heart. Detection usually involves the staining of sections of aortic sinus or artery with Oil Red O (ORO) followed by computer imaging and analysis; or from Nile Red Staining. In addition, fluorescent microscopy or flow cytometry can be used to detect OxLDL uptake when OxLDL has been labeled with 1,1′-dioctadecyl-3,3,3′3′-tetra-methylindocyanide percholorate (DiL-OxLDL). Autoimmunity occurs when the body starts attacking itself. The link between atherosclerosis and autoimmunity is plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs). PDCs contribute to the early stages of the formation of atherosclerotic lesions in the blood vessels by releasing large quantities of type 1 interferons (INF). Stimulation of pDCs leads to an increase of macrophages present in plaques. However, during later stages of lesion progression, pDCs have been shown to have a protective effect by activating T cells and Treg function; leading to disease suppression. ==Degradation== Foam cell degradation or more specifically the breakdown of esterified cholesterols, is facilitated by a number of efflux receptors and pathways. Esterified cholesterol from cytoplasmic liquid droplets are once again hydrolyzed to free cholesterol by acid cholesterol esterase. Free cholesterol can then be secreted from the macrophage by the efflux to ApoA1 and ApoE discs via the ABCA1 receptor. This pathway is usually used by modified or pathological lipoproteins like AcLDL, OxLDL and βVLDL. FC can also be transported to a recycling compartment through the efflux to ApoA1 containing HDLs (high density lipoproteins) via aqueous diffusion or transport through the SR-B1 or ABCG1 receptors. While this pathway can also be used by modified lipoproteins, LDL derived cholesterol can only use this pathway to excrete FC. The differences in excretory pathways between types of lipoproteins is mainly a result of the cholesterol being segregated into different areas.Linton MF, Yancey PG, Davies SS, et al. The Role of Lipids and Lipoproteins in Atherosclerosis. [Updated 2015 Dec 24]. In: De Groot LJ, Chrousos G, Dungan K, et al., editors. Endotext [Internet]. South Dartmouth (MA): MDText.com, Inc.; 2000-. Available from: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK343489 ==Infectious diseases== Foamy macrophages are also found in diseases caused by pathogens that persist in the body, such as Chlamydia, Toxoplasma, or Mycobacterium tuberculosis. In tuberculosis (TB), bacterial lipids disable macrophages from pumping out excess LDL, causing them to turn into foam cells around the TB granulomas in the lung. The cholesterol forms a rich food source for the bacteria. As the macrophages die, the mass of cholesterol in the center of the granuloma becomes a cheesy substance called caseum. ==Other conditions== Foam cells may form around leaked silicone from breast implants. Lipid-laden alveolar macrophages, also known as pulmonary foam cells, are seen in bronchoalveolar lavage specimens in some respiratory diseases. ==References== Category:Macrophages ","title":"Foam cell"},{"id":"5560410","text":"Pine Dock is a small fishing community by Lake Winnipeg in Manitoba, Canada.

Declarations take various forms in different legal systems. ==Canon law== In the canon law of the Catholic Church, a declaration of nullity, (commonly called an annulment and less commonly a decree of nullity)Annulment/Decree of Nullity, EWTN.com, accessed 9/11/2015 is authoritative judgment on the part of an ecclesiastical tribunal juridically establishing the fact that a marriage was invalidly contracted or, less frequently, a judgment juridically establishing the fact that an ordination was invalidly conferred. It does not dissolve a valid bond of marriage, but it is merely a factual declaration of the nullity of the bond. ==Common law== In common law, a declaration ordinarily refers to a judgment of the court or an award of an arbitration tribunal that is a binding adjudication of the rights or other legal relations of the parties which does not provide for or order enforcement. Where the declaration is made by a court, it is usually referred to as a declaratory judgment. Less commonly, where declaratory relief is awarded by an arbitrator, it is normally called a declaratory award. Declaratory relief is most commonly seen in two particular circumstances: # applications for declarations of legitimacy, in family and probate legal proceedings; and # under insurance policies, for a determination of whether a peril is covered by a particular policy. ==European Union law== Applications for declaratory relief in other areas have become more widespread, particularly in Europe. A key feature in relation to this development has been the Brussels and Lugano Conventions on civil jurisdiction and judgments relating to members of the European Economic Area (EEA). In certain circumstances, jurisdiction is awarded under the conventions to the courts first seised of the matter. This has led to a rise in defendants taking pre-emptive action by seeking \\"declarations of non-liability\\" in a race to the courthouse to ensure that they choose the court first seised rather than waiting for the claimant to do so. ==Declaratory legislation== An act of parliament or other statute is declaratory if it purports to state authoritatively what is the current state of affairs. By contrast, most statutes are positive law, purporting to order a future state of affairs. In lingustic terms, declaratory legislation is indicative whereas positive law is performative. Two acts of the Parliament of Great Britain asserting its right to legislate for other jurisdictions are commonly called \\"the Declaratory Act\\": one in 1719 relating to the Kingdom of Ireland, and another in 1766 relating to the Thirteen Colonies. The \\"Declaratory Articles\\" of the Church of Scotland likewise mean to define a status that already existed. ==Other legal uses== Declaration is used (sometimes rendered as a verb) in other ways in certain legal systems. *In some legal systems, a declaration is similar to an affidavit. *In relation to companies, declaration is the first step in relation to distribution and payment of dividends. *In trust law, a settlor who declares that he holds certain property on trust is said to make a declaration of trust. *Dying declarations are an exception to the rule against hearsay in many legal systems. *Declarations against interest are also an exception to the rule against hearsay in many legal systems. *A formal declaration of default is required to enforce creditors' security rights in some legal systems. *An interpretative declaration is a formal note made by a state upon ratifying a treaty clarifying the state's interpretation of the treaty. ==External linksReferences== Category:Civil procedure Category:Evidence law Category:Judicial legal terminology ","title":"Declaration (law)"},{"id":"5560456","text":"234 (two hundred [and] thirty-four) is the integer following 233 and preceding 235. 234 is a practical number.

Smodem refers to a bidirectional protocol for file transfer used between modems and the DOS program in which the protocol is implemented, both of which were developed by a Finnish company named Arisoft. It was mainly used in bulletin board systems because it could transfer files in both directions at the same time and allowed users to chat with each other with AriSoft's GroupChat software. Other popular bidirectional protocols such as BiModem, HS/Link and HydraCom also offered a chat option with the operator, but not with the system's other users. == Smodem protocol overview == Unlike ZMODEM and other older protocols, SMODEM has a separate low-level multiplexed transfer layer (MSLP) and a high-level file transfer layer. This simplifies the protocol design and provides a very high efficiency of 99.5%. The multiplexing makes it possible to send one or more files in a continuous stream without any breaks between the files, boosting the throughput dramatically when transferring multiple files. The multiplexing also made possible to add a full-screen ANSI terminal emulator with a local full- featured line editor and colored scroll-back buffer of 'unlimited' size. The locally buffered terminal emulation allowed users to chat during full-speed bidirectional file transfers. The protocol is symmetrical and can connect with itself in loop-back mode. Files can be simultaneously transmitted and received without noticeable performance loss. SMODEM detects DESQview and DPMI (Windows, OS/2) and releases all unused processor capacity to the host system. It is written in the C language and compiled with Microsoft Visual C++ v1.0 compiler, optimized for an 80286 CPU. It needs at least 200 kB free memory to function properly and more to allow shelling from the program. Files can not be transferred while the shell is being used. == Multiplexed Serial Link Protocol (MSLP) == MSLP has the capability to simultaneously manage 32 independent channels. Every single channel uses a traditional two-phase type sub protocol. Maximum efficiency is achieved by simultaneously using multiple parallel channels to keep the transmitter busy. The maximum packet size floats between 16 and 1024 bytes. Transfer errors reduce the packet size depending on error frequency. The transmitter window size (the total size of transmitted packets pending acknowledgment) can be limited to get a faster response. The packet frame contains one byte for the channel number and two bytes for a 16-bit CCITT(ITU)-CRC, using the same algorithm as in error correcting modems. The acknowledgements and inquiries are included in the packet frame when needed. The packet separators contain two bytes, which if found in transferred data, one additional byte is inserted for encapsulation of control data. The probability of the packet separator sequence appearing in random data is so small, that it does not affect protocol efficiency like old style one byte separators do. The maximum efficiency in one-direction error-free transfers will be: \\\\frac{max\\\\ packetsize}{max\\\\ packetsize\\\\ +\\\\ frame\\\\ size} = \\\\frac{1024}{1024+5} = 0.9951 = 99.5\\\\% If the packet size is limited to 256 bytes, the efficiency is 98.1%, which is still better than original Zmodem. If the data link can not transfer some special characters, then the traditional character encapsulation mode can be activated. In this mode the selected character codes are encapsulated, which reduces the performance by about 0.4% + additional 0.4% for every selected character code. In case the data link is limited to seven data bits, a special bit collection mode can be activated. The highest bits for every seven bytes are collected to one byte (which is eight bits under normal conditions). This collection reduces the performance about 12.4% and doubles the character encapsulation capacity. The maximum transfer line correction mode of MSLP uses five characters to transmit four characters that use only printable 7-bit ASCII codes (Ascii85). This mode should work on almost every non-transparent transmission line. The maximum correction mode reduces the performance by 20%. It should only be used for test purposes if the default settings do not work or if the limitations of transfer line are unknown or too complex to handle with separate adjustments. ==References== * The Smodem Techinfo.doc * HydraCom ==External links== * Arisoft Oy Category:BBS file transfer protocols Category:Communication software Category:Terminal emulators ","title":"SMODEM"},{"id":"5560489","text":"In this example of retrofitting, a set of modern door opening buttons have been retrofitted to this British Rail Class 483 Electric multiple unit, which was derived from 1938 tube stock. Retrofitting refers to the addition of new technology or features to older systems, for example: * power plant retrofit, improving power plant efficiency / increasing output / reducing emissions * home energy retrofit, the improving of existing buildings with energy efficiency equipment * seismic retrofit, the process of strengthening older buildings in order to make them earthquake-resistant * Naval vessels often undergo retrofitting in dry dock to incorporate new technologies, change their operational designation, or compensate for perceived weaknesses in their design or gun plan. ==Benefits of a retrofit== * Saving on capital expenditure while benefiting from new technologies * Optimization of existing plant components * Adaptation of the plant for new or changed products * Increase in piece number and cycle time * Guaranteed spare parts availabilityarticle on retrofit, retrieved on 4 June 2010 * Reduced maintenance costs and increased reliability ==Manufacturing== Principally retrofitting describes the measures taken in the manufacturing industry to allow new or updated parts to be fitted to old or outdated assemblies (like blades to wind turbines). The production of retrofit parts is necessary in manufacture when the design of a large assembly is changed or revised. If, after the changes have been implemented, a customer (with an old version of the product) wishes to purchase a replacement part then retrofit parts and assembling techniques will have to be used so that the revised parts will fit suitably onto the older assembly. Retrofitting is an important process used for valves and actuators to ensure optimal operation of an industrial plant. One example is retrofitting a 3-way valve into a 2-way valve, which results in closing one of the three openings to continue using the valve for certain industrial systems. Retrofitting can improve a machine or system's overall functionality by using advanced and updated equipment and technology—such as integrating Human Machine Interfaces into older factories. Another example of this is car customizing, where older vehicles are fitted with new technologies: power windows, cruise control, remote keyless systems, electric fuel pumps, driverless systems,George Hotz is giving away the code behind his self-driving car project etc. Trucks and agricultural machines can also be given retrofits to make them driverless. ==Environmental management== The term is also used in the field of environmental engineering, particularly to describe construction or renovation projects on previously built sites, to improve water quality in nearby streams, rivers or lakes. The concept has also been applied to changing the output mix of energy from power plants to cogeneration in urban areas with a potential for district heating. Sites with extensive impervious surfaces (such as parking lots and rooftops) can generate high levels of stormwater runoff during rainstorms, and this can damage nearby water bodies. These problems can often be addressed by installing new stormwater management features on the site, a process that practitioners refer to as stormwater retrofitting. Stormwater management practices used in retrofit projects include rain gardens, permeable paving and green roofs.Center for Watershed Protection. Ellicott City, MD (2007). \\"Urban Stormwater Retrofit Practices.\\" (See also stream restoration.) ==Naval vessels== Many naval vessels have undergone retrofitting and refitting, sometimes entire classes at once. For instance, the New Threat Upgrade program of the US Navy saw many vessels retrofitted for improved anti-air capability. Naval vessels are often retrofit for one of three reasons: to incorporate new technology, to compensate for performance gaps or weaknesses in design, or to change the ship's classification. Militaries of the world are often ardent adopters of the latest technology, and many technological advances have been spurred by warfare, especially in fields such as radar and radio communications. Because of this, and the significant investment that a ship hull represents, it is common for retrofitting to be performed whenever new systems are developed. This may be as small as replacing one type of radio with another, or replacing out-dated cryptography equipment with more secure methods of communication, or as major as replacing entire guns and turrets, adding armor plate, or new propulsion systems. Other ships are retrofit to compensate for weaknesses perceived in their operational capabilities. This was the secondary purpose of the US Navy's New Threat Upgrade program, for instance. Major changes in doctrine or the art of warfare also necessitate changes, such as the anti-aircraft upgrades performed on many World War Two-era vessels as air power became a dominant part of naval strategy and tactics. Additionally, because of the investment a hull represents, few navies scrap front-line warships. Many times smaller ships are retrofitted for patrol, coast guard, or specialized roles when they are no longer fit for duty as part of a warfleet. The Japanese Momi class from the interwar period, for example, was converted from destroyers to patrol boats in 1939, as they were no longer capable enough to serve in the role of destroyer. Other times classes are retrofit because they are no longer needed in warfare, due to changes in tactics. For instance, the was an aircraft carrier converted from a collier (coal-carrying ship to supply coal- fired steamships with fuel) of the Jupiter-class. Because of the heavy use of retrofitting and refitting fictional navies also include the concept. As an example, in the Star Trek MMORPG Star Trek Online players can purchase retrofitted ships of famous Star Trek ship classes such as those manned by the protagonists of the Star Trek TV series. This is done to allow players to pilot iconic ships of the series from old series of the show that wouldn't naturally be latest-and-greatest ships due to their obsolescence or size but are retrofit to be suitable for a maximum-level player-character admiral. ==See also== * Automotive aftermarket * Diesel particulate filter (DPF) * Electric vehicle conversion * Green retrofit * Patch (computing) * Reindustrialization * Scrappage program * Software backporting ==ReferencesExternal links== * Diesel Retrofit in Europe. * Diesel retrofit glossary * Diesel Retrofits Help Clean Regions' Air – Maryland Department of Environment * Diesel Emission Control Strategies Verification – California Air Resources Board Category:Electric vehicle conversion Category:Environmental engineering Category:Production and manufacturing Category:Vehicle modifications Category:Water pollution ","title":"Retrofitting"},{"id":"5560502","text":"Millie's Cookies logo Millies shop sign Millie's Cookies is a chain of retail bakeries based in the United Kingdom, specializing in cookies, muffins, hot drinks and gifts.

He was President of the Institution of Civil Engineers for 1882-3. He was born in Kelso in the Scottish Borders in 1816. ==Early life== Brunlees was the son of John Brunlees, the gardener of the Duke of Roxburghe's agent, and Margaret Rutherford. As a youth he assisted the surveyor Alexander Adie in surveying the roads on the Duke's estates and decided to be a civil engineer. He studied at Edinburgh University then worked on the Bolton and Preston Railway under Adie before working on various railways in Scotland and Northern England in a staff of engineers. ==Londonderry and Coleraine Railway== In 1850, Brunlees worked on the Londonderry and Coleraine Railway. For this job he was obliged to build an embankment over Rosse’s Bay on the River Foyle, surmounting great difficulties. ==Railway across Morecambe Bay== Brunlees was the Construction Engineer for the Ulverston and Lancaster Railway. This was a short but difficult and important railway to link the Furness Railway network to the Lancaster and Carlisle Railway line and thence to all points further south in the British network. The route was planned by McClean and Stileman at 19 miles in length of which ten miles comprised embankments and viaducts across tidal water. Much of this was sand running to a depth of 30 to 70 feet. This made it very challenging to build. In business terms the Manchester-based railway contractors John Brogden and Sons were the prime movers of this railway. The Ulverstone and Lancaster Railway Act received the Royal Assent on 24 July 1851 but work was not in full progress until September 1853 because workers and accommodation for them were not readily available. McClean and Stileman had resigned as engineers in the previous February so another engineer had to supervise construction. Brunlees was chosen because of his success with the River Foyle project. The line was opened on 26 August 1857. Brunlees wrote a paper on this project for the Institution of Civil Engineers in which he described the design profile of the embankments and a novel design of drawbridge for the viaducts to withstand the winds and waves. His work on the U&L; earned him praise from men like Locke and Hawkshaw. Viaducts were built across the estuaries of the rivers Kent and Leven and these were designed and built by W & J Galloway & Sons of Manchester using a novel piling system involving waterjets. Later on, they worked together on Southport Pier using a similar system. ==Railway across the Solway Firth== James Brunlees was the engineer of the Solway Junction Railway. This involved a cast-iron girder viaduct between Bowness-on-Solway and Annan across the Solway Firth in Scotland. It had 193 spans with 2,892 tons of cast iron for the piles and 1,807 tons of wrought iron. The Act of Parliament was passed in 1864 and the railway was opened in 1869. Unfortunately in 1875 and 1881 the viaduct was damaged by ice. In 1881 the damage was severe and there was a Board of Trade Inquiry. The inspecting officer said that because of the thickness of ice, the size of the ice-floes, and the absence of wind, it was not surprising that the cast-iron columns had not withstood the shock. This method of construction should be avoided in estuaries where the climate was subject to sudden changes in temperature and to blows from floating ice. He had no objection to rebuilding the viaduct but recommended modifications to prevent a repetition. He did not criticise anyone however, perhaps because this type of engineering was new and everyone was learning. page 28 ==São Paulo, Brazil== Brunlees became engineer of the São Paulo Railway in 1856, with D. M. Fox as assistant. They used cable haulage on a 5-foot 3 inch gauge railway. They used four inclined planes at a gradient of 1 in 9.75 to surmount a 2,650 foot escarpment. The line was completed in 1867. In 1873, he was awarded the order of the Order of the Rose. ==Other work== Brunlees' grave in Brookwood Cemetery Brunlees served as a railway engineer in the construction of the Mersey Railway, connecting Liverpool and Birkenhead. He also worked in maritime engineering and was responsible for the construction of the docks at Avonmouth and Whitehaven as well as the piers at Southport and Southend. He was the engineer of the 3 ft gauge Gorseddau Tramway at Portmadoc.Captain Henry Whatley Tyler; On the Festiniog Railway for Passengers: as a 2-feet gauge, with sharp curves, and worked by locomotive engines; Institution of Civil Engineers; 11 April 1865 - post-presentation discussion Brunlees was engineer, as well as one of the leading shareholders and directors, of the Mont Cenis Pass Railway, active mainly during planning and construction, 1864-1868. There is evidence that Brunlees also worked with the Brogdens on their New Zealand projects.A search for Brunlees in the Index of New Zealand National Archives gives: \\"5 September 1877 - Notice of assignment to J Brunlees and J Brogden of contracts between the Governor of New Zealand and Messrs Brogden and Sons\\" Search made 9 March 2008Also Appendices to the Journals of the NZ House of Representatives and NZ Papers Past contain clear references to work by Brunlees or his associates in New Zealand. Some of these involve Brogdens and some do not. He served as president of the Institution of Civil Engineers between December 1882 and December 1883. He was knighted in 1886.Mike Chrimes, 'Brunlees, Sir James (1816–1892)', Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, Sept 2004; online edn, Jan 2008 accessed 13 Sept 2009 He died at Argyle Lodge in Wimbledon, London on 2 June 1892 and was buried in Brookwood Cemetery. ==Family== He married Elizabeth Kirkman in 1845. == References == Category:1816 births Category:1892 deaths Category:Scottish civil engineers Category:British railway pioneers Category:Presidents of the Institution of Civil Engineers Category:Presidents of the Smeatonian Society of Civil Engineers Category:Recipients of the Order of the Rose Category:People from Kelso, Scottish Borders Category:Fellows of the Royal Society of Edinburgh Category:Alumni of the University of Edinburgh Category:Burials at Brookwood Cemetery ","title":"James Brunlees"},{"id":"5560505","text":"Bridget Harrison (born 22 February 1971) is a freelance journalist and Contributing Editor at the Times Magazine.

He is the patron saint of adopted children. ==Life== Practically most that is known of William comes from the Nova Legenda Anglie, and that is little. He was born in Perth, at that time one of the principal towns of Scotland. In youth, he had been somewhat wild, but on reaching manhood he devoted himself wholly to the service of God. A baker by trade (some sources say he was a fisherman), he was accustomed to setting aside every tenth loaf for the poor. He went to Mass daily, and one morning, before it was light, found on the threshold of the church an abandoned child, whom he adopted and to whom he taught his trade. Later he took a vow to visit the Holy Places, and, having received the consecrated wallet and staff as a Palmer, set out with his adopted son, whose name is given as \\"Cockermay Doucri\\", which is said to be Scots for \\"David the Foundling\\". They stayed three days at Rochester, and purposed to proceed next day to Canterbury (and perhaps thence to Jerusalem), but instead David wilfully misled his benefactor on a short-cut and, with robbery in view, felled him with a blow on the head and cut his throat. The body was discovered by a mad woman, who plaited a garland of honeysuckle and placed it first on the head of the corpse and then her own, whereupon the madness left her. On learning her tale the monks of Rochester carried the body to the cathedral and there buried it. He was honoured as a martyr because he was on a pilgrimage to holy places. As a result of the miracle involving the madwoman as well as other miracles wrought at his intercession after death, he was acclaimed a saint by the people. ==Veneration== In 1256 Lawrence of St Martin, Bishop of Rochester, obtained the canonisation of William from Pope Alexander IV. A beginning was at once made with his shrine, which was situated first in the crypt, then in the northeast transept, and attracted crowds of pilgrims. At the same time a small chapel was built at the place of the murder, which was thereafter called Palmersdene. Remains of this chapel are still to be seen near the present St William's Hospital, on the road leading by Horsted Farm to Maidstone. The shrine of St William of Perth became a place of pilgrimage second only to Canterbury's shrine of Saint Thomas Becket, bringing many thousands of medieval pilgrims to the cathedral.Father Gagnier's Jubilee Year Pilgrimage : Rochester, England: Castle,Cathedral & R.C. Church Their footsteps wore down the original stone Pilgrim Steps, and nowadays they are covered with wooden steps.The Cathedral Margaret Darcy, of Essex, in her will, expressed the wish that her servant, Margaret Staunford, should go on a pilgrimage to \\"Seint Willyam of Rowchester\\". PROB 11/8/289 On 18 and 19 February 1300, King Edward I gave two donations of seven shillings to the shrine. Offerings at the shrine were also recorded for Queen Philippa (1352). On 29 November 1399, Pope Boniface IX granted an indulgence to those who visited and gave alms to the shrine on certain specified days. The local people continued to make bequests through the 15th and 16th centuries. The coat of arms of the Bishop of Rochester consists of Saint Andrew's cross with a scallop shell in its centre, which is said to represent William; Andrew being the patron saint of Scotland and scallops being the symbol of pilgrimage. St. William is represented in a wall-painting, which was discovered in 1883 in Frindsbury church, near Rochester, which is supposed to have been painted about 1256–1266. His official feast day is 23 May, though there is another feast day celebrated on 22 April. He is the patron saint of adopted children. In the film St. Vincent, St William is featured in a school report by one of the main characters, Oliver, who finds him interesting primarily because he himself is adopted. St William of Perth Primary School, Rochester, is named after him. ==See also== * Saint William of Perth, patron saint archive == References External links== * William of Perth at the Catholic Encyclopedia * Saint of the Day, May 23 * Saint William of Rochester * Rochester Cathedral Category:1201 deaths Category:Medway Category:People from Perth, Scotland Category:Perth, Scotland Category:Burials at Rochester Cathedral Category:British bakers Category:13th-century Roman Catholic martyrs Category:Medieval Scottish saints Category:Medieval English saints Category:Year of birth unknown ","title":"William of Perth"},{"id":"5560530","text":"Temple, Texas The Temple Daily Telegram is the daily newspaper of Temple, Texas, serving Central Texas since 1907.

It holds a 77% approval rating on review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, based on 52 reviews, with an average rating of 6.78/10. The critical consensus reads: \\"First-timer Duplass offers a realistic and thoughtful romantic comedy.\\" On Metacritic, the film holds a rating of 73 out of 100 based on 17 critics, indicating \\"Generally favorable reviews. Scott Founders of Variety gave the film a positive review writing : \\"The delicate art of reupholstery, as it applies to furniture and human relationships, gives weight to the comic machinations of “The Puffy Chair,” the smart and painfully funny debut feature by filmmaker brothers Jay and Mark Duplass. [It] is an unusually human comedy of manners that, even when it falters, feels like a breath of fresh air pumped into an asphyxiating genre. Warm Sundance reception suggests dirt-cheap pic could develop a strong word-of-mouth following, particularly among college auds(sic).\\" Nick Schager of SlantMagazine.com gave the film 2.5/4 writing : \\"the film never quite strikes a comfortable or graceful balance between silliness and solemnity, so that when the informal story eventually transforms into a sobering portrait of a crumbling relationship, the effect—compounded by the often-unlikable self-involvement of its characters—is more off-putting than appealing.\\" ==ReferencesExternal links== * * *Wired magazine: Netflix Presents Category:2005 films Category:American films Category:Camcorder films Category:2000s road comedy- drama films Category:2005 romantic comedy-drama films Category:American road comedy-drama films Category:American independent films Category:American romantic comedy-drama films Category:Duplass Brothers Productions films Category:Mumblecore films Category:2005 directorial debut films Category:2005 comedy films Category:2005 drama films Category:2005 independent films ","title":"The Puffy Chair"},{"id":"5560597","text":"Leeds city centre is the central business district of Leeds, West Yorkshire. England. It is roughly bounded by the Inner Ring Road to the north and the River Aire to the south and can be divided into several quarters. == Central districts == Arena Quarter Leeds Arena The Arena Quarter is a mixed-use area best known for being the home of the First Direct Arena. Its location is directly north of Merrion Street. The Inner Ring Road borders the district on both the east and north boundary, with Woodhouse Lane acting as the district's western boundary. It is mainly made up of high-rise residential properties and developments, including Sky Plaza and Opal 3. Altus House is the tallest building in Yorkshire. Other major institutions are located within the Quarter, including the Yorkshire Bank HQ and also the Merrion Centre. Queen Square is also found here. The Calls The Calls is close to the River Aire. It is directly south of the Retail Quarter and to the west of Crown Point Road. The area's decline began in the early 20th century when industry moved away from the centre out towards Hunslet, Holbeck, Armley and Kirkstall. From 1985 to 1995 Leeds Corporation carried out a major regeneration with a careful conversion of listed building warehouses and new build in sympathetic style for a mixed-use area. Many of the area's old industrial buildings have now been converted into modern flats and commercial buildings. The western part of the area is centred on Lower Briggate, where Leeds' LGBT nightlife is focused. Civic Quarter Leeds Town Hall The Civic Quarter is the area roughly north-west of The Headrow and west of the Arena Quarter. It is home to a number of grand Victorian buildings that are important in the civic life of the city. Prominent landmarks include Leeds Magistrates' and Crown Courts, the City Library, City Art Gallery and Leeds Town Hall, which was completed in 1858 and opened by Queen Victoria. The city's largest hospital, the Leeds General Infirmary, has been operating here since 1869. Behind Leeds Town Hall are Millennium Square and Leeds Civic Hall. Millennium Square was a flagship project to mark the year 2000 and hosts regular concerts, with past performers including the Kaiser Chiefs, Bridewell Taxis, HARD-Fi, Fall Out Boy and Embrace. Leeds Civic Hall was opened in 1933 by King George V and is home to the Lord Mayor's Room and the council chambers. Many barristers' chambers and solicitors' offices are found here because of the close proximity to the courts. Also nearby are Leeds Metropolitan University, the University of Leeds, Leeds College of Art and the Park Lane and Technology campuses of Leeds City College. Cultural Quarter Inside the Royal Armouries main stairwell The Cultural Quarter is in the east of the city centre on Quarry Hill. Landmarks here include the BBC building, which moved from Woodhouse Lane in August 2004; the Leeds Playhouse, which opened in March 1990; Leeds College of Music, which moved to its current location in 1997; and Northern Ballet which moved to the area in 2010. Leeds City College also has a large campus here. Leeds Dock also lies to the south of the Cultural Quarter and is where the Royal Armouries Museum can be found. The building, designed by architect Derek Walker, was built at a cost of £42.5 million and completed in two years, and has since become one of the city's major tourist attractions Financial Quarter Infirmary Street in the heart of financial quarter. Park Square in the financial quarter Bank House, the Bank of England offices on King Street in Leeds. The Financial Quarter is bounded by Park Row to the East, Leeds Inner Ring Road to the west, The Headrow to the north and Wellington Street to the south. It is centred on the Georgian Park Square, one of the green spaces in Leeds city centre. The City Centre Loop passes through the quarter, using City Square, Quebec Street, King Street and East Parade. Leeds Law School is at Cloth Hall Court. Major names can be found in the financial quarter such as Aviva and The Bank of England. The district has grown out towards the west of the city. The Wellington Place development and the wider Wellington Gardens area of the city contain a number of international corporations. Wellington Place is currently under construction. Holbeck Urban Village Historically, Holbeck Urban Village was Holbeck's closest area to the centre of Leeds. Due to the expansion of the city, it is now considered part of the city centre and was rezoned as Holbeck Urban Village, following the completion of a number of developments. is the name given by local government and planning agencies to a mixed-use urban renewal area south of Leeds railway station. Bridgewater Place and also Granary Wharf are within Holbeck Urban Village. The new High Speed 2 station will border this area of Leeds, which is why much of the area is considered prime location for development. Shopping Quarter Victoria Quarter The Shopping Quarter, extends south from the Headrow and includes Leeds' major shopping locations. It is considered the retail core of Leeds, containing Corn Exchange, Leeds Kirkgate Market, Trinity Leeds and also both Victoria Gate and Victoria Quarter. Kirkgate and Briggate are the oldest streets in Leeds, from which the city grew. The Shopping Quarter can be subdivided into several areas including Victoria, a high-end shopping district home to one of the UK's only Harvey Nichols stores. Development of the area has seen two new additional indoor malls, Victoria Gate and Trinity Leeds. Trinity Leeds opening day Opened 21 March 2013, Trinity Leeds shopping centre had a surge of 130,000 people enter its doors on the first day of opening. Costing £350m, and creating 3,000 jobs, this was a major development for Leeds. It was the only major retail development to open in the UK in 2013. It covers 1,000,000 sq ft (92,900 sq m) with key anchor stores being Topman and M&S.; Other stores in the centre include Apple, River Island, Next, Hollister, H&M;, Primark, Everyman, Conran Restaurants and Mango. It has a capacity for 120 shops and numerous pop-up shops. Victoria Gate's construction was completed in 2016 and won numerous awards as one of the best malls in the world. It houses the city centre's John Lewis department store, along with many other flagship stores of premium brands. Older parts of the Victorian District include department stores in Leeds which have historically included Lewis's, which became Allders in 1996 and latterly closed in 2005, Schofields which was taken over by House of Fraser in 1988 and closed in 1996, the Co-op which closed in the mid 1990s, Littlewoods which closed in the late 1990s and is now occupied by Zara and H&M;, C&A; which closed in 2001 and is currently occupied by Next Clearance (until demolition for construction of the Trinity Quarter) and Marshall & Snelgrove which became part of Debenhams and closed in the 1970s and lies of the site of Lloyds TSB on Park Row have disappeared but currently department stores include Debenhams (historically known as Matthias Robinson), Harvey Nichols (which when opened in 1996 became the first branch outside London), Marks and Spencer, BHS and House of Fraser (formerly a Woolworths, it temporarily became premises for Schofields and latterly became Rackhams before becoming House of Fraser in 1996). King Edward street Most streets in the District are connected to Briggate, one of the main shopping streets, home to several national and international food chains, like McDonald's, Burger King and Nando's, and international shopping chains, including Zara. Off Briggate are several of Leeds' famous shopping arcades, such as Thornton's Arcade and the Victoria Quarter. Briggate was fully pedestrianised in 1996 and connected the two previously pedestrian areas either side of it. Other shopping attractions include the Corn Exchange, Leeds Kirkgate Market, Granary Wharfe, Leeds Shopping Plaza, Headrow Shopping Centre, The Light, the St John's Centre,and Crown Point Retail park which lies half a mile away from the retail core. ==Major corporations== Within the Financial Quarter *The Bank of England *Aviva *Zurich Financial Services *Leeds Building Society *Lloyds TSB Elsewhere in the city centre *KPMG *Direct Line *Yorkshire Bank Outside of the city centre, First Direct have their headquarters at Stourton, while HBOS have major offices in Lovell Park. == Leeds Lights == Each Christmas the streets of Leeds city centre are decorated with a variety of Christmas lights. The widely publicised ‘switch-on' ceremony is in early November, when a celebrity flicks the switch to illuminate the decorations at Victoria Gardens and usually attracts tens-of-thousands of people to the turning on ceremony. When Leeds Lights were first established in 1983, the switch on was held on the 4th Thursday of November, however it has since been brought forward. The illuminations are renowned as being the largest display in the United Kingdom, spanning over 13 miles of city centre streets and using over 2 million low energy light bulbs. Leeds is notable for designing, manufacturing and maintaining its own Christmas Light motifs. Its workshop began as a place to provide people with disabilities some employment opportunities. Its workshop has had several locations, beginning in a temporary location near Chapeltown Road, then to the old disused Whitbread Brewery site at Kirkstall and from 1993 to the present Seacroft location. Leeds City Council was the only local authority to do this for some years but now a small number have followed Leeds Lights example in preparing their own displays where as most other councils buy in their lights and services. The lights are repaired and pressure cleaned annually at the Leeds Lights workshop in Seacroft throughout the year. 80,000 coloured lamps are stored at the workshop, and 2000m of coloured rope light are used. A team of 14 works all year round producing the display. From October–January, a team of 9 works to erect the lights ready for the switch on in early November, before removing the lights after Christmas. Commercial advertising has been permitted on some of the lights, such as The Headrow's champagne bottle lights.

The station is one of 20 in Great Britain to be managed by Network Rail. It is the busiest English station outside London, and the UK's second busiest station outside London after Glasgow Central.http://www.rail- reg.gov.uk/upload/xls/station-usage-2006-07.xls The station serves national, regional and suburban railway services. Air The city centre is served by Leeds Bradford Airport. This is situated in Yeadon approximately seven miles North West of the city centre. The city centre is linked to the airport by the 757 Yorkshire Tiger bus service. The airport serves major European destinations as well as many further afield. Road Traffic passing past Leeds city centre is diverted away from the main areas by the Leeds Inner Ring Road, an urban motorway passing the East, North and West of the city centre. Much of the Inner Ring Road is in tunnels so not visible to passing pedestrians. All major routes into Leeds head towards the city centre. The city centre is served by the M621 motorway. Buses The most notable bus service within central Leeds is the LeedsCityBus service operated by First Leeds and funded by West Yorkshire Metro. This service runs every few minutes in a clockwise direction around the city centre. It serves major transport interchanges and both universities as well as the main shopping and financial districts. There have been calls for a second FreeCityBus to serve emerging business, leisure and residential districts in the southern part of central Leeds. Leeds city centre has its main bus station in the east of the city. However, as a rule only buses heading out of the City of Leeds and National Express services use it. Local First Leeds buses use stops on the city streets, or a number of smaller bus stations, referred to as bus points, at Bond Street, Infirmary Street, Leeds railway station and the Corn Exchange.

Johnson, 243 Ky. 533, 49 S.W.2d 347 (1932). In Ludwig, a statute prohibiting a non-paying passenger from suing the operator for negligence was found unconstitutional. The doctrine has been upheld several times since then, but remains the subject of criticism that it is a judicial fiction. The doctrine was reaffirmed in Williams v. Wilson, 972 S.W.2d 260 (Ky. 1998), where the court invalidated a statute requiring a finding of intent for punitive damages to be available. The court reasoned that punitive damages were available for gross negligence in 1891 (when the Constitution took effect), and that the malice requirement of the statute in question effectively banned a cause of action based on negligence.

All in all published and staged in 34 countries, among them Great Britain, USA, Canada, Germany, France, Spain, Poland, Turkey, Pakistan, Egypt, Russia, China and Japan. ==Biography== Dalager was born in Copenhagen in the post-war period of the 1950s, a time of painful remembrances of the Second World War, continued economic restrictions, and a growing optimism about the future. His parents were grocers throughout the 1950s and 1960s, until his father was struck by Parkinson's disease. He describes his radically changing family structure as he and his two younger brothers moved with their parents to the provincial town of Herning in Jutland, near to where his father had been raised. There he graduated from high school, after which he attended the University of Århus, where he received his master's degree and a Ph.D. in comparative literature. It was there also where he became involved in the student movement of the 1970s. With his then fiancée, Anne Marie Mai, he wrote several books on literature, including a two-volume study of Danish women writers from the Middle Ages to contemporary times, \\"Danske kvindelige forfattere 1-2\\". In 1982 Dalager left the University of Copenhagen to live as a writer, which he has continued to do since. He has written poetry, fiction (prose), drama, filmscripts and essays. Several of his poems and novels have been translated into other languages, and he has seen his plays staged in Moscow, New York City, Berlin, and other cities around the world. Dalager's work concentrates on the existential conditions of both ordinary people and contemporary and historical known persons, with moments of psychological soul-searching expressed within a multitude of differing conditions. Dalager's diverse gallery of characters ranges from the woman of his Sarajevo monologue, I Count the Hours, to Danish storyteller Hans Christian Andersen in the play Lord and Shadow and the novel \\"Journey in blue\\"; from the dissident Count Claus Stauffenberg and Adolf Hitler in his novel To dage i juli (Two Days in July)to dr. Simon Wiesenthal in his novel \\"Labyrinten\\" (\\"The Labyrinth\\"). the 11th of sept. The poetry cycle Århus-elegi (Aarhus eulogy) of 1986 represents his poetic breakthrough. His most recent collection, Den tynde væg (The thin Wall), was published in 2016. Dalager writes of his own poetry: \\"For me poetry gives room for a more intimate and personal reflection in an attempt to 'answer' some of the changes of our times. What has particularly been of interest for me as a poet is to try to find the words for the vanitas of things in the midst of our modern living. Having two daughters, 9 and 11 years of age, I have more and more come to see the emotions of love as the most important source of my writing.\\" Three of his latest prose-works were the novels Journey in blue(about H.C. Andersen) published in 2004 (English 2006), The Labyrinth in 2006 and Land of shadows(about 9/11 in New York) in 2007. Dalager's 2017 novel Kvinde i et århundrede (Woman in a Century) about the first female philospher in Europe, Elisabeth of Bohemia, and his 2020 Kaos og verden (Chaos and The World) about Trumps America and AI are his most recent to have been published. ==Prose== *Hærværksforeningen og andre noveller, 1980 *Bergomi, novel, 1984 *Jon, novel, 1986 *Glemsel og erindring, novel, 1992. *Davids bog (David's Book), novel, 1995.

He has written over a thousand articles about Montreal for a variety of magazines and newspapers, starting with a weekly column in the Westmount Examiner which he wrote at age 16, between stints spent manning his father's parking lot next to the old Forum, behind the “Texan” restaurant. He has since written a variety of news stories for magazines ranging from Canadian Business to Saturday Night as well as his popular Montreal history and news site Coolopolis. Gravenor spent several years writing news and city columns for the Montreal Mirror where his articles shed light on often sensational yet little- known stories about Montreal, including one on a trial of three women accused of beating rock star Serge Fiori and the ongoing tragedy of the Duplessis Orphans. In the late-1990s Gravenor was returning via motorboat from Laval following a Frankie Goes to Hollywood reunion concert when his anchor snagged a fiber optic cable on the bed of the Rivière des Prairies, thus disrupting Internet services to an estimated 1.28 million users in the Greater Montreal region. Among those worst impacted was the incipient PornHub website, which at the time was being developed by MafiaBoy in the attic of the Orange Julep on Décarie. Bell Canada Enterprises was subsequently held responsible for not properly identifying the cable and failing to issue an appropriate notice to mariners; as a result, Gravenor was awarded $350,000 in damages that he used to start 8675310 Quebec Inc., which Gravenor joked was \\"one better than Tommy Tutone's LLC.\\" 8675310 Quebec Inc. acquired an extensive inventory of media- related real estate holdings across the island of Montreal, including a newsstand on the southeast corner of Saint-Laurent and des Pins, the Metropolitan News Agency building on Cypress, the Amusements 2000 building on Sainte-Catherine, and Condomania on Crescent. 8675310 Quebec Inc. had also considered a friendly backflip takeover of Maison de la Presse Internationale at the time that MdlPI had expanded to more than 35 outlets; however, Gravenor was quoted as saying \\"Print is not the future\\" as early as 1999, and the takeover was never attempted. In 2017, Gravenor authored the ambitious Montreal: 375 Tales of Eating Drinking, Living and Loving which chronicles the history of Montreal's most prominent bars, restaurants, venues and stores, as well as other subjects such as sports, transportation and oddball stories. In 2002 he co-authored with his brother John David Gravenor the Montreal guidebook Montreal: The Unknown City. He has also written articles about real estate, of which he has considerable experience as well as the country of Azerbaijan, a country he has visited and studied. In 2014 he was the subject of intense scrutiny in the Azeri media when, during a visit to the mud volcanoes of Qobustan, he encountered the Russian girl band Serebro beside their broken down Lada Niva after the group's driver had attempted to walk 10 miles to the nearest village in search of assistance. Gravenor was able to provide the band with coats, food, and beverages, and drove them back into Baku, where the band invited him to be their guest of honor during that night's concert at the Heydar Aliyev Center. The media reported that the lead singer of Serebro, Olga Seryabkina, had spontaneously penned a song especially for Gravenor entitled You Saved Me from My Grave (nor), which the band performed as their encore musical act. A bootleg recording of the song appeared under the literal translation You Disentombed Me (nyet) and briefly achieved near-viral status on WorldStarHipHop before being removed by Columbia Records due to alleged copyright infringement. The lyrics of the song were criticized by the Baku daily Azerbaycan as being \\"too risqué for prime-time,\\" but some fans praised the fact that Serebro's \\"emotions were high.\\" During the same visit, Gravenor was credited with advancing discussions on a common market in the Caucasus, proposing a unified investment framework with strategic harmonization of equity-based derivatives of state-owned enterprises, leveraging the area's natural resource wealth in order to accelerate regional economic growth. Gravenor has also argued against dollar- denominated debt, reasoning that the imposition of such liabilities by international financial institutions unnecessarily limits the ability of developing countries such as Azerbaijan to freely implement their own monetary policy and address fiscal imbalances. In 2015 Gravenor was one of the only Western journalists to report on an idiot savant living in Turkmenbashi, Turkmenistan, whom Gravenor visited via motorboat from Baku. The man had claimed to be able to recite from memory the UPC codes of over 25,000 different consumer items, but Gravenor was unable to confirm the authenticity of the man's claims beyond his ability to recite the UPC codes of about two dozen packaged items lying around his house, which seemed to have been planted. Consequently, Gravenor decided not to report on the man's Savant syndrome. Instead, Gravenor recorded a since-deleted podcast about the man's claims that he had engaged in unprotected coitus with over 1,000 different prostitutes without ever having contracted a sexually-transmitted disease. The man asserted that his immunity was the result of a faithful adherence to urinating immediately before and after intercourse. Turkmen pharmaceutical executives, alerted to the man's claims by Gravenor's podcast, ordered an analysis of the man's urine in order to further the development of a pre- exposure prophylaxis, but as of 2018 there had been no published medical literature on the topic. Gravenor was identified as a possible Good Samaritan in the March, 2013 helicopter escape from Saint-Jérôme Prison. At the time of the escape, Gravenor's numbered company, 8675310 Quebec Inc., had been holding a St. Patrick's Day party at the former Iraqi Consulate property located at 120 rue Sommerville in the Ahuntsic-Cartierville borough of Montreal, which was reportedly attended by several A-llst Quebec celebrities including JoJo Savard, Julie Masse, and Corey Hart, as well as rapper D Natural and Muriel DeMarco, the executive producer of TQS' Bleu Nuit series. As Corey Hart was about to begin performing an acoustic version of Sunglasses at Night, speaker feedback from Gravenor's police scanner and Flightradar24 uncensored airspace apps alerted the crowd to the fact that the helicopter carrying the two fugitives from the Saint-Jérôme detention facility was flying south toward the Riviére des Prairies. Because the consulate property had its own private dock accessible via right-of-way on the opposite side of the street, Gravenor was able to board his motorboat and promptly travel in the direction of the Hydro Québec Rivière des Prairies generating station. Once the helicopter entered the airspace above the dam, Gravenor reportedly used a laser pointer to shine a beam of light in the eyes of the helicopter pilot. According to sources familiar with the investigation who were subsequently interviewed on CJWI-AM radio, the pilot admitted to authorities that he had been \\"dazzled\\" in the area of southeast Laval and that this may have been a contributing factor in his decision to circle back and land a few minutes later in Chertsey prior to being captured. Gravenor briefly recounted elements of the story during an appearance on MAtv in May 2017, although he strongly disputed the interviewer's claim that he had in any way been \\"heroic.\\" His children are Tyra, Livia, Annika and Owen Gravenor. ==Early life and education== He is the son of Colin Gravenor and Patricia Roberts. Gravenor has a BA from McGill University and an MA from Concordia University where he specialized in studying the rise of fascism in Europe. ==ReferencesExternal links== *Coolopolis Category:Anglophone Quebec people Category:Living people Category:McGill University alumni Category:Concordia University alumni Category:Journalists from Montreal Category:Writers from Montreal Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Kristian Gravenor"},{"id":"5560652","text":"Antonín Kubálek (November 8, 1935January 18, 2011) was a Czech-Canadian classical pianist. ==Life and career== Kubálek was born in Libkovice, Most District, Czechoslovakia and studied in Prague with Czech pianist František Maxián. He emigrated to Canada in 1968 and settled in Toronto. During his time in Canada, Kubálek performed in solo, chamber and orchestral concerts. Antonin Kubálek's artistry and musicianship commanded respect and admiration from audiences and critics internationally. He received three standing ovations following his performance in the Rudolfinum at the 2002 Prague Spring Festival. In November 2002, Kubálek was recognized by the Czech Music Council with a UNESCO honorary award. His exceptionally wide repertoire contained Czech and Canadian music, including contemporary pieces; but also romantic works by Chopin, Schumann, and especially Brahms, for which he is considered to be one of the foremost performers of recent times. A respected educator, Kubálek served on the faculties of The Royal Conservatory of Music, University of Toronto, York University, the Prague Conservatory and the Prague Academy of Performing Arts. He chaired the Fred Gaviller Memorial Foundation, a Toronto organization whose mission was to sponsor debut recitals of young artists. Kubálek also served as chair of the Advisory Committee of the Kapralova Society in Toronto and participated in the first Canadian documentary on Vítězslava Kaprálová for the CBC Radio 2 in 2001. In 2003 he established an annual festival in Zlaté Hory in the Czech Republic, The International Kubalek Piano Courses, for young pianists. Among his most important pupils of that time were Richard Pohl and Birute Bizeviciute. Kubálek was twice nominated for the Juno Award in Canada. He died in Prague after surgery for a brain tumour.CBC News, 23 January 2011 ==Discography== Kubálek was a best-selling international recording artist, having over a dozen CDs available at the time of his death and two dozen LP titles to his credit. His award-winning CD recordings on the Dorian Recordings label won him praise in such publications as the American Record Guide, Fanfare Magazine, CD Review, and Gramophone Magazine. Glenn Gould made a unique contribution to this Canadian artist's career. Gould's only foray into the role of producer was inspired by Kubálek's playing: the Second Piano Sonata by Erich Wolfgang Korngold was the fruit of this singular musical union. == Notes References== * Tomáš Knopp: Děti neklidné Evropy (Children of restless Europe), 2003, . == External links == * Official page * * Biography in Czech * International Festival - Kubalek Piano Courses * Category:1935 births Category:2011 deaths Category:People from Most District Category:Canadian pianists Category:Canadian classical pianists Category:Male classical pianists Category:Czech pianists Category:The Royal Conservatory of Music faculty Category:Czechoslovak emigrants to Canada Category:Academics of the Prague Conservatory Category:20th-century classical pianists Category:20th-century Canadian pianists Category:20th-century male musicians ","title":"Antonín Kubálek"},{"id":"5560666","text":"Protein A is a 42 kDa surface protein originally found in the cell wall of the bacteria Staphylococcus aureus. It is encoded by the spa gene and its regulation is controlled by DNA topology, cellular osmolarity, and a two- component system called ArlS-ArlR. It has found use in biochemical research because of its ability to bind immunoglobulins. It is composed of five homologous Ig-binding domains that fold into a three-helix bundle. Each domain is able to bind proteins from many mammalian species, most notably IgGs. It binds the heavy chain within the Fc region of most immunoglobulins and also within the Fab region in the case of the human VH3 family. Through these interactions in serum, where IgG molecules are bound in the wrong orientation (in relation to normal antibody function), the bacteria disrupts opsonization and phagocytosis. ==History== As a by-product of his work on type-specific staphylococcus antigens, Verwey reported in 1940 that a protein fraction prepared from extracts of these bacteria non-specifically precipitated rabbit antisera raised against different staphylococcus types. In 1958, Jensen confirmed Verwey’s finding and showed that rabbit pre-immunization sera as well as normal human sera bound to the active component in the staphylococcus extract; he designated this component Antigen A (because it was found in fraction A of the extract) but thought it was a polysaccharide. The misclassification of the protein was the result of faulty tests but it was not long thereafter (1962) that Löfkvist and Sjöquist corrected the error and confirmed that Antigen A was in fact a surface protein on the bacterial wall of certain strains of S. aureus. The Bergen group from Norway named the protein \\"Protein A\\" after the antigen fraction isolated by Jensen. ==Protein A antibody binding== It has been shown via crystallographic refinement that the primary binding site for protein A is on the Fc region, between the CH2 and CH3 domains. In addition, protein A has been shown to bind human IgG molecules containing IgG F(ab')2 fragments from the human VH3 gene family. Protein A can bind with strong affinity to the Fc portion of immunoglobulin of certain species as shown in the below table. {  !Species !Subclass !Binding - Human IgA variable -  IgD weak or none -  IgE weak or none -  IgG1 strong -  IgG2 strong -  IgG3 weak or none -  IgG4 strong -  IgM variable - Avian egg yolk IgY weak or none - Bovine  medium - Canine  medium - Goat  weak or none - Guinea pig IgG1 strong - Hamster  weak - Horse  medium - Koala  weak or none - Llama  weak or none - Monkey (rhesus)  strong - Murine IgG1 weak -  IgG2a strong -  IgG2 medium to strong -  IgG3 medium -  IgM variable - Pig  medium to strong - Rabbit  strong - Rat IgG1 weak or none -  IgG2a weak or none -  IgG2b weak or none -  IgG3 weak - Sheep  weak or none } ==Other antibody binding proteins== In addition to protein A, other immunoglobulin-binding bacterial proteins such as Protein G, Protein A/G and Protein L are all commonly used to purify, immobilize or detect immunoglobulins. ==Role in pathogenesis== As a pathogen, Staphylococcus aureus utilizes protein A, along with a host of other proteins and surface factors, to aid its survival and virulence. To this end, protein A plays a multifaceted role: # By binding the Fc portion of antibodies, protein A renders them inaccessible to the opsonins, thus impairing phagocytosis of the bacteria via immune cell attack. # Protein A facilitates the adherence of S. aureus to human von Willebrand factor (vWF)-coated surfaces, thus increasing the bacteria's infectiousness at the site of skin penetration. # Protein A can inflame lung tissue by binding to tumor necrosis factor 1(TNFR-1) receptors. This interaction has been shown to play a key role in the pathogenesis of staphylococcal pneumonia. # Protein A has been shown to cripple humoral (antibody-mediated) immunity which in turn means that individuals can be repeatedly infected with S. aureus since they cannot mount a strong antibody response. # Protein A has been shown to promote the formation of biofilms both when the protein is covalently linked to the bacterial cell wall as well as in solution. Protein A helps inhibit phagocytic engulfment and acts as an immunological disguise. Higher levels of protein A in different strains of S. aureus have been associated with nasal carriage of this bacteria. Mutants of S. aureus lacking protein A are more efficiently phagocytosed in vitro, and mutants in infection models have diminished virulence. == Production == Protein A is produced and purified in industrial fermentation for use in immunology, biological research and industrial applications (see below). Natural (or native) protein A can be cultured in Staphylococcus aureus and contains the five homologous antibody binding regions described above and a C-terminal region for cell wall attachment. Today, protein A is more commonly produced recombinantly in Escherichia coli. (Brevibacillus has also been shown to be an effective host.) Recombinant versions of protein A also contain the five homologous antibody binding domains but may vary in other parts of the structure in order to facilitate coupling to porous substrates Engineered versions of the protein are also available, the first of which was rProtein A, B4, C-CYS. Engineered versions are multimers (typically tetramers, pentamers or hexamers) of a single domain which has been modified to improve usability in industrial applications. ==Research== Protein A is often coupled to other molecules such as a fluorescent dye, enzymes, biotin, colloidal gold or radioactive iodine without affecting the antibody binding site. Examples including protein A–gold (PAG) stain is used in immunogold labelling, fluorophore coupled protein A for immunofluorescence, and DNA docking strand coupled protein A for DNA-PAINT imaging. It is also widely utilized coupled to magnetic, latex and agarose beads. Protein A is often immobilized onto a solid support and used as reliable method for purifying total IgG from crude protein mixtures such as serum or ascites fluid, or coupled with one of the above markers to detect the presence of antibodies. The first example of protein A being coupled to a porous bead for purification of IgG was published in 1972. Immunoprecipitation studies with protein A conjugated to beads are also commonly used to purify proteins or protein complexes indirectly through antibodies against the protein or protein complex of interest. == Role in industrial purification of antibodies == This process flow diagram shows how monoclonal antibodies are typically purified at industrial scale. The first reference in the literature to a commercially available protein A chromatography resin appeared in 1976. Today, chromatographic separation using protein A immobilized on porous substrates is the most widely established method for purifying monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) from harvest cell culture supernatant. The choice of protein A as the preferred method is due to the high purity and yield which are easily and reliably achieved. This forms the basis for a general antibody purification \\"platform\\" which simplifies manufacturing operations and reduces the time and effort required to develop purification processes. A typical mAb purification process is shown at right. Albeit the long history of protein A chromatography for the production of antibodies, the process is still being improved today. Continuous chromatography, more precisely periodic counter-current chromatography, enormously increases the productivity of the purification step. == References == Category:Proteins Category:Staphylococcaceae ","title":"Protein A"},{"id":"5560677","text":"Scarborough Sixth Form College is located on the outskirts of Scarborough, North Yorkshire, England. ==Background== The Sixth form college offers a variety of study courses to around 1,000 mostly 16- to 19-year-olds.

The program debuted January 11, 1997, when WRAL-TV was a CBS affiliate. It currently airs at 11 a.m. on Saturdays, and the current host is former WRAL traffic reporter Mark Roberts. Early programs were hosted by WRAL weathercaster Greg Fishel. ==Rules== Each Brain Game show is contested by three teams of three players each. Teams may buzz in and attempt to answer at any time while the question is being read. Team members may confer with one another prior to answering. Academic-based questions in the games come from the standard North Carolina curriculum for ninth and tenth graders. Prior to fall 2008, the teams with the nine best scores advanced to a playoff of three semifinal games, with the winners advancing to a championship game. Teams could advance to the semifinals without winning their regular season games - only the score accumulated during the regular season game determined the playoff teams. In the fall of 2008, the rules were changed so that the winners of each game would automatically advance to the playoffs. The best non-winning high score qualified a team as a \\"wild card\\" in the playoffs. The format used in Brain Game differs from other quiz bowl formats in some ways: *Brain Game allows three players to compete at a time, other formats permit four players *Regardless of who buzzes in on a team, anyone on the team may answer the question *Three teams compete at a time, other formats have two teams compete at a time *Brain game includes audio or visual clues via monitors visible to contestants Starting in 2009, regular-season matches were played with three teams competing. The top 6 teams advance to the playoffs, which have two teams competing. The winners of the three head-to-head matches in the first round advance to the second round, along with the highest scoring losing team, leaving four teams. At this point, a champion is chosen based on single- elimination rules. ==Format and Segments== Brain Game shows consist of the following segments: *Pop-Up Culture **10 questions about pop culture, worth twenty points up or down *Headliners **10 questions about current events, worth twenty points up or down *Word Power **teams buzz in to fill in a crossword puzzle based on clues, worth twenty points up or down *Arts and Crafts **ten questions about art, culture, literature, and music, worth twenty points up or down *Name Game **each team gets thirty seconds to answer five questions (directed to one team at a time), worth ten points up or down. If a team gets all five questions correct, they receive a twenty-point bonus *Crunching Numbers **five math questions, worth twenty points up or down *Rocket Science **ten questions about science, worth twenty points up or down *Globetrotting **ten questions about an area of the world that varies from show to show, worth twenty points up or down. On the last question of this category, all teams will wager 1-100 points and write down their answers. Each team will gain or lose the number of points they wagered based on whether or not they answer correctly. *Note that the players know beforehand what areas of the world and of the United States will be covered in the Globetrotting round. ==Participants and Winners== Most teams that participate in Brain Game come from the WRAL-TV viewing area.

Claudiosaurus is the most basal neodiapsid. Claudiosarus are found to be a sister group of the Neodiapsida. The pattern of the vertebrate, girle, and limbs indicates that Claudiosaurus and Thadeosaurus share a common ancestor. == History and discovery == Claudiosaurus is known from the Sakamena Formation of Madagascar. Originally claudiosaurs were found from the Late Permian, but they have been recently also found in Early Triassic deposits of Madagascar. == Biology and description == Life restoration of Claudiosaurus germaini Claudiosaurus was one of the first members of the Neodiapsida, a group of reptiles containing diapsids more derived than the primitive Araeoscelidia. It had a relatively long body and neck, reaching on overall length of about . It is presumed to have been partially oceanic, living its life in a way similar to the modern marine iguana. The main reason for this theory is that the skeleton included substantial amounts cartilage, instead of bone, indicating it had trouble supporting its weight on land. In particular, the sternum was poorly developed, which would have made walking difficult out of water. Instead, it probably swam by undulating its body and tail, and holding its legs close to the body to increase streamlining. A more recent study however indicates that its vertebral column tail and leg proportions are closer to those of terrestrial reptiles, though it is noted that marine iguanas similarly only differ from terrestrial counterparts very subtly.Pablo Nuñez Demarco et al. Was Mesosaurus a Fully Aquatic Reptile? Front. Ecol. Evol, published online July 27, 2018; doi: 10.3389/fevo.2018.00109 The mean vertebral is approximately twice of Hovasaurus. Claudiosaurus have a more slender tail than Hovasaurus. The frontal contributes the dorsal orbital margin. This prevents the prefrontal from contacting the post frontal. The post frontal is ventrally expanded posteriorly and contributes to the orbital rim. The anterior process of the pterygoid is straight. The closest skull comparison can be with the genus Anarosaurus. Claudiosaurus differs from Acerosodontosaurus and Hovasaurus in the presence of a proportionately long neck. == Behavior ==  Locomotion  It is theorized that Claudiosaurus was semi-aquatic. The discovery of pachyostotic thickening of the limb bones and vertebrae supports this theory. The margins of contact in the carpals are poorly defined and therefore retained a lot of cartilage, providing a greater ‘ degree of flexibility’ that would be beneficial for swimming.  Feeding ecology  There is evidence of aquatic feeding habits. Supporting this is the small size of the skull, nature of the palate and marginal dentition and the long neck. == Classification == Claudiosaurus is recovered as a relative of turtles by Li et al. (2018), forming a clade with the basal neodiapsid Acerosodontosaurus.Chun Li; Nicholas C. Fraser; Olivier Rieppel; Xiao-Chun Wu (2018). \\"A Triassic stem turtle with an edentulous beak\\".

Its portfolio comprises townships, eco- sanctuaries, luxury enclaves, high-rise residences, commercial and retail as well as integrated mixed developments. Since its inception, S P Setia Berhad has become one of the established property development companies based in Malaysia. The group started out in 1974 as a construction company which was later led by a well-known property development figure, Liew Kee Sin. in 1990 and was eventually listed on Bursa Malaysia in 1993. In 1996, S P Setia refocused its core business to property development with supporting businesses in construction and wood-based manufacturing. In 2011/2012, Permodalan Nasional Berhad (PNB), Malaysia's state asset manager which was then under Tun Ahmad Sarji Abdul Hamid, took over S P Setia, joining the foray of acquisitions led by the government-linked companies in private property sector. Tan Sri Liew Kee Sin stepped down as the president and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of S P Setia Berhad in 2014 and joined Eco World Development Group Bhd as a non-independent & non-executive director. S P Setia currently has a presence in the three key economic regions of Malaysia, namely Klang Valley, Johor and Penang, as well as in Kota Kinabalu, Sabah. Internationally, S P Setia’s projects are present in Vietnam, Australia, Singapore, the United Kingdom, China and the most recent one being in Japan. The employees of S P Setia are commonly referred to by the organisation as Team Setia which currently stands at approximately 2,000 people. S P Setia’s charitable trust, Setia Foundation, was established in 2000 with the objective of lending a helping hand to underprivileged individuals and charities in the areas of education, general welfare, and medical assistance. In the year 2015, S P Setia Foundation embarked on a mission to adopt schools housing underprivileged students in rural areas. To date, S P Setia Foundation has successfully adopted nine schools located in Selangor, Penang and Johor. ==List of Projects== Local Central Region * Setia Alam * Setia City Residences * Setia EcoHill * Setia EcoHill 2 * Setia Mayuri * Setia Eco Park * Setia Eco Templer * Setia Safiro * Setia Eco Glades * Setia Sky Seputeh * Setia Seraya Residences * Setia Alaman * TRIO by Setia * KL Eco City * Bandar Kinrara * Temasya Glenmarie * Alam Impian * Bandar Baru Seri Petaling * Setia Alamsari * Kota Bayuemas * Alam Damai * Alam Sutera Northern Region * Setia Pearl Island * Setia Greens * Setia SPICE (Setia Subterranean Penang International Convention & Exhibition Centre) * Setia Sky Vista * Setia Sky Ville * Setia Fontaines * Setia V Residences * 11 Brook Residences Southern Region * Setia Eco Cascadia * Setia Tropika * Setia Indah * Setia Eco Gardens * Bukit Indah Johor * Setia Sky 88 * Setia Business Park II * Taman Perling * Taman Rinting * Taman Pelangi * Taman Pelangi Indah * Taman Industri Jaya Eastern Region * Aeropod, Kota Kinabalu International United Kingdom * Battersea Power Station China * Qinzhou Industrial Park Japan * Izumisano City Centre, Osaka Vietnam * EcoLakes, My Phuoc * EcoXuan, Lai Thieu Singapore * Daintree Residence * Eco Sanctuary * 18 Woodsville Australia * Sapphire by the Gardens, Melbourne * UNO, Melbourne * MAISON, Carnegie * MARQUE Residences, Prahran ==Awards & Recognition== FIABCI Malaysia Property Award Office Category Winner 2019 - KL Eco City by S P Setia Best Purpose-Built/ Specialised Project 2018 - Setia SPICE, Penang 2011 - Eco Greens, Setia Eco Gardens, Johor Master Plan Gold award 2017 - Setia Eco Glades, Cyberjaya Best Affordable Housing 2017 - Seri Kasturi Apartment, Setia Alam Best Sustainable Development 2015 - S P Setia Corporate Headquarters, Selangor Best Retail Development 2013 – Setia City Mall, Selangor Best Master Plan Development 2012 - Setia Alam, Selangor 2008 - Setia Eco Gardens, Johor 2006 - Setia Eco Park, Selangor Best Residential (Low-Rise) Development 2010 - Setia Eco Park, Selangor 2006 - Duta Nusantara, Kuala Lumpur FIABCI World Prix d'Excellence Awards FIABCI World Gold Award in the Office Category 2020 - KL Eco City by S P Setia FIABCI World Gold Award in the Purpose-Built Category 2019 - Setia SPICE, Penang World Silver Awards in the Residential High-Rise Category 2019 - Parque, Melbourne World Silver Awards in the Residential Mid-Rise Category 2019 - Circus West Village, Battersea Power Station, London World Gold Winner of FIABCI World Prix d’ Excellence Award 2018 Affordable Housing Category 2018 - Seri Kasturi Apartment, Setia Alam, Selangor Master Plan Category 2018 - Setia Eco Glades, Cyberjaya Sustainable Development Category 2018 - Eco Sanctuary, Singapore Gold Winner of Sustainable Development Category 2016 - S P Setia Corporate Headquarters Best Retail Development 2014 - Setia City Mall, Selangor Best Master Plan Development 2013 - Setia Alam, Selangor 2009 - Setia Eco Gardens, Johor 2007 - Setia Eco Park, Selangor Best Purpose-Built/Specialised Project 2012 - Eco Greens, Setia Eco Gardens, Johor Best Residential (Low-Rise) Development 2011 - Setia Eco Park, Selangor Runner-up Best Master Plan Development 2010 - EcoLakes, Vietnam AON Best Employers Malaysia Award Best Employer in Malaysia (2018, 2017, 2016, 2015) Special Recognition for Commitment to Engagement Award (2016) Best of the Best Employer in Malaysia (2013) Overall Best Employer in Malaysia and one of the Best Employers in Asia Pacific (2011) Top 10 Best Employers in Malaysia (2009, 2005, 2003) Ranked No.1 for the 10th time (2018, 2017, 2016, 2013, 2012, 2011, 2010, 2008, 2007, 2006, 2005) The Edge Malaysia Top Property Developers Awards Best Qualitative Attributes Category (2018, 2013, 2012) Best Quantitative Attributes Category (2018) The Edge Malaysia Outstanding Property CEO Award 2017 - Dato' Khor Chap Jen Affordable Urban Housing Excellence Award 2017 - Seri Mutiara Apartment, Selangor 2016 - Seri Kasturi Apartment, Selangor Notable Property Achievement 2015 - Setia Eco Park, Selangor PAM Green Excellence Awards 2015 - Setia Corporate HQ, Selangor 2013 - Setia City Mall The Edge-PEPS Value Creation Excellence Awards 2013 - Setia Walk, Selangor ==Board of Directors== 1\\\\.

No Fate... But What We Make for Ourselves (2004)  The band released the album No Fate... But What We Make for Ourselves in June 2004 on Ottawa's Pop Culture Records and they went directly on three weeks of the Vans Warped Tour 2004 in support of it. The band also toured to promote the record extensively throughout the east coast Provinces of Canada, Quebec and Southern Ontario. The record was also later released in Japan on Bullion Records.  Don't Get Lost In A Movement (2005-2006)  The Fully Down signed to Fearless Records (Culver City, California) in August 2005. Their Fearless Records debut, Don't Get Lost In A Movement was released throughout North America on November 22, 2005. The band headed directly to the United States for a countrywide tour in support of the record with Four Year Strong (Worcester, Massachusetts) and Maida. The following spring, the band headed out across Canada on the Tour and Loathing headlined by Protest The Hero and including A Wilhelm Scream, Bayside and The Spill Canvas. The tour ended halfway through April, and they began touring with Boy Sets Fire (Newark, Delaware) and Versus the Mirror until the end of May. The summer of 2006 was spent back on the Vans Warped Tour; as the band played all 50 dates on the Smartpunk stage. In late 2006, the band appeared on the Radio Rebellion Tour in support of Norma Jean (Douglasville, Georgia), Between the Buried and Me, Fear Before the March of Flames and Misery Signals. In December they flew to Japan in support of Bodyjar, Bigwig and FACT (Ibaraki Prefecture, Japan) starting in Osaka and finishing up in Tokyo. In December 2006, vocalist Gab Bouchard announced that he was leaving the band. He played his last show on December 27, at The Salt Lounge in London, Ontario. The Fully Down announced Justin Camarena, of Tough Call (Detroit, MI) would be taking on Lead Vocals after a six-month hiatus. Camarena was a founding member of the punk rock band Tough Call, which had a loyal following from their inception in 2003 until they disbanded following Justin's departure to join The Fully Down. During that time they recorded over forty songs for their next record of which a few demos where posted on Myspace and Purevolume. Breakup and final concert On July 30, 2008 the band posted a blog entry on their Myspace page announcing that they were breaking up, with their final show occurring at Zaphod Beeblebrox in Ottawa on August 23, 2008. 2008-present Since then, a few of the band members have started other projects. Dan Hay (guitar) joined Ottawa band Amos the Transparent, Alex Newman (bass) moved to London, Ontario to start his new band, The Bad Ideas but has since moved back to Ottawa, Ontario. ==Lineup== Richard Latour - drums Alex Newman - bass George Hadji - guitar Dan Hay - guitar Kris Parks - guitar Justin Camarena - vocals ==Former members== Gab Bouchard - vocals (2003–2006) Joe Brownrigg - vocals, guitar (1999–2002) Dustin Wenzel - drums, backup vocals (1999-2002) Aaron Libbey - vocals (2002) ==Discography== {  !

It was split from area code 412 on February 1, 1998. Originally, Bell Atlantic wanted to implement 724 as an overlay of 412. However, overlays were still a new concept at the time, and met with some resistance due to the requirement for ten-digit dialing. For this reason, 724 was implemented as a split, with nearly all of the old 412 territory outside Allegheny County getting the new area code, making it one of the six pairs of \\"doughnut area codes\\" in the numbering plan. Within only two years, both 724 and 412 were on the verge of exhaustion due to the Pittsburgh area's rapid growth and the proliferation of cell phones and pagers. By this time, overlays had gained more acceptance, and area code 878 was implemented as an overlay for both the 412 and 724 territories on August 17, 2001. Since that date, ten-digit dialing has been mandatory in southwestern Pennsylvania. Number conserving practices allowed for 724 and 412 area code usage to be extended until April, 2013. The first 878 numbers were issued in April 2013, after 724 was exhausted. 412 has yet to be exhausted.

It simultaneously overlays the region's two existing area codes, 412 and 724, making ten-digit dialing mandatory in the Pittsburgh area. 412 had served southwestern Pennsylvania for 41 years before 724 was created for most of the old 412 territory outside of Pittsburgh in 1998. Bell Atlantic (now part of Verizon), the main telephone provider in the area, wanted to implement 724 as an overlay to spare residents and businesses the burden of changing their numbers. However, overlays were still a new concept at the time, and met with considerable resistance due to the need for ten-digit dialing. Thus, the proposal was changed to a geographic split. Within two years, however, both 412 and 724 were on the verge of exhaustion. Overlays had gained more acceptance by then, so 878 was implemented as an overlay. It came into effect on August 17, 2001. Although ten-digit dialing has been mandatory in southwestern Pennsylvania since 2001, no 878 numbers were assigned for more than a decade due to number-conservation procedures implemented in both Pittsburgh itself and the suburbs. On February 15, 2013, the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission announced it would start to issue 878 numbers in the 724 territory sometime within the next year, as 724 was nearly exhausted.

Produced to sustain the group during a period of mismanagement, it was their first album with German producer Thomas Fehlmann, as well as their last with input from Kris Weston, who appears in a much diminished role as engineer. The chaotic Pomme Fritz moved the group away from their melodic, ambient sound towards a more abstract, experimental style, incorporating instances of noise, sampling, fragmented rhythms, industrial textures, indecipherable voices, and sound collage techniques. Island Records \\"hated\\" the album and \\"didn't understand it at all\\", according to group leader Alex Paterson. Upon its release, Pomme Fritz reached number six on the UK Albums Chart, but divided fans and critics, with some panning it as \\"doodling\\" and noting its absence of focus. However, Rolling Stone described it as an \\"aural feast\\" despite its \\"lack of cohesion\\" and direction. The album has seen more acclaim in recent times, and Paterson has described it as one of his favourite Orb albums. ==Background and production== Pomme Fritz was the Orb's (pictured 2005) first album with Thomas Fehlmann (right). In the early 1990s, The Orb pioneered the style ambient house, fusing dub basslines and house beats with atmospheric, psychedelic soundscapes. Their Top 30-charting debut album The Orb's Adventures Beyond the Ultraworld (1991) received critical acclaim, and this continued with their second album U.F.Orb (1992), which also saw the group's commercial zenith, reaching number one in the UK Albums Chart. Despite wishing to continue being prolific in 1993, the Orb's record label Big Life Records went against their wishes by re-releasing their early singles, and the group refused to released any new material until the cease and desist promise from the label and began looking to seek a new record contract. The Orb were subsequently signed to major label Island Records by their management. A stop- gap live album, Live 93, reached number 23 in the Albums Chart later that year. Having recorded the 39-minute single \\"Blue Room\\", the Orb wanted to record a 41-minute album as their first studio record for Island. Their plan was to record one track and then \\"mix it down into six very different versions.\\" Recorded in London and Berlin from 1993 to 1994 using an expensive budget on behalf of Island, Pomme Fritz was produced with ADAT (Alesis Digital Audio Tape), and group lader Alex Paterson also believes it to be the first Orb album to use ProTools, which was operated on a Mac. He later told PopMatters that the album was recorded when the Orb were being \\"used and abused by bad management\\" and his goal was to \\"keep the Orb's dream alive.\\" Pomme Fritz was the Orb's first album with German techno producer Thomas Felhmann, who has remained a part-time member of the group. Kris Weston's role in the Orb, meanwhile, became greatly diminished, as he is credited only as an engineer. ==Composition== Pomme Fritz sees the Orb abandon their melodic, ambient dub sound and accessible dance beats in favour of a more aggressive sound, pursuing a more experimental, industrial direction with more upfront percussion and beats, although the album is largely beat-free. It is characterised by lithe, fragmented rhythms, airy sounds, usage of sampling, industrial textures, unfocused noises and an absence of easily discernible melodies, with many of the tracks incorporating ambient techno characteristics, scrambled voices, noise, clattering metal sounds and \\"short- circuiting machines.\\" Techno elements also appear courtesy of Fehlmann's contributions. A calmly intoned found vocal sample referring to a \\"heavy session of electroshock therapy\\" that wipes the listeners' \\"childhood traumas\\" at the expense of \\"most of your personality\\" appears three times throughout the album, an example of the group's black humour that also reflects the album's \\"often soothing chaos and ambient disorganisation.\\" Opening track \\"Pomme Fritz (Meat 'N Veg)\\" is reminiscent of krautrock and is constructed around chimes with overlapping elliptical guitar and low frequency bass figures. Snippets of Steve Reich's Music for Mallet Instruments are believed to be sampled on the song. The following tracks are more abstract and closer to noise, with the second and third tracks \\"More Gills Less Fischake\\" and \\"We're Pastie to Be Grill You\\" being the Orb's most experimental works to date, with unintelligible vocal samples and 'wheezing' synthesiser lines. The latter track is a musique concrète, multi-speed voice collage that uses only treated and cut-up vocals and features no instrumentation or beats. \\"Bang 'er 'N' Chips\\" features shuffling beats, surrealist 'sound bytes' and \\"calliope keyboards,\\" curating what one critic described as a \\"sinister carnival romp.\\" \\"Alles Ist Schoen\\" features ambient grooves, while the closing track \\"His Immortal Long- ness\\" is a simplistic, childlike tune that displays the group's \\"optimistic edge\\" within its organ motif, which surfaces in synth parts during \\"teeming noise pastiches.\\" ==Release== According to Paterson, the Orb locked Island's A&R; staff member in their studio with an acid tab to listen to Pomme Fritz after its completion. He reflected: \\"An hour later he came out and said, 'This is godlike – I have to have it', and this was his first release for Island.\\" Paterson nonetheless recalled that the rest of Island Records \\"hated\\" the album and \\"didn't understand it at all,\\" being confused by its lack of single material, and even after the release of Live 93 and Pomme Fritz, the label complained that the Orb had yet delivered them a sufficient album. Writer Sean O'Neal reflected in 2001: \\"It always blew my mind that Island, a major label, released Pomme Fritz.\\" Prior to release, Stuart Maconie wrote that, due to the Orb being one of the \\"shaping influences of their times,\\" Pomme Fritz – the Orb's first release of new material for two years – became eagerly awaited. As is evident by its subtitle The Orb's Little Album, The Orb were keen to point out that Pomme Fritz was not their comeback album proper, and due to it being a \\"little album,\\" it retailed at a cheap price below the standard for full-length CDs. The electroshock-centred vocal sample from the album was written out and used at the centre of the album's advertisements in the music press, along with a tagline that referred to the album's tracks as \\"ambient soundscapes.\\" Although no singles were released from the album, it debuted and peaked at number 6 in the UK Albums Chart, making it one of the group's highest charting albums, although it only stayed on the chart for six weeks, a slight decline upon the nine-week chart run of the chart-topping U.F.Orb. On 24 June 2008, a \\"Remastered and Expanded\\" edition of the album was released by Universal Music, containing a bonus disc of five bonus remixes. According to one writer: \\"The remixes here, including a typically fluid reinterpretation by Thomas Fehlmann, provide further genetic mutations of Pomme Fritz's strange lifeforms.\\" ==Critical reception== Pomme Fritz challenged the Orb's fan base, and similarly perplexed critics. Stuart Maconie of Select was moderately favourable. He called the album an \\"interesting half hour plus\\" and felt it was something of \\"an aural teaser ad\\" to subsequent material. He highlighted \\"Pomme Fritz (Meat 'N Veg)\\" as the album's finest track, and felt the other tracks were an \\"amorphous series of variations\\" upon it. Jon Wiederhorn of Rolling Stone described the album as an \\"aural feast,\\" and felt that the Orb \\"inspire awe by splashing a profusion of unfocused noises and samples across a grid of billowing, textured synth lines,\\" instead of \\"[engendering] hypnosis through minimalism and repetition\\" like other ambient groups. He did however note a \\"lack of cohesion\\" which makes the album feel incomplete. Pomme Fritz was picked as a \\"Staff Selection\\" in Spin, where Joe Stowe noted the \\"creepier\\" direction, \\"futzing and splooging everything from (what sounds like) Hindi ululations to the Nuremberg rally across six soundscapes to the extremely fugged of head.\\" Among retrospective reviews; Derek Walmsley of The Quietus felt the album was one of the Orb's \\"greatest achievements,\\" describing it as a \\"concise yet bewilderingly multi-layered statement.\\" In The Rough Guide to Rock, Daniel Jacobs and David Wren chose Pomme Fritz as one of the Orb's best albums, calling it their \\"least ambient\\" record. James Ferguson of Trouser Press, who felt the album seemed \\"vaguely angry\\" and bore an \\"impenetrable gloom,\\" wrote that it was \\"glaringly obvious that Paterson had grown weary of the music that he helped to codify,\\" while Resident Advisor felt the album \\"[tested] the boundaries of electronica.\\" An editor in the Rolling Stone Album Guide feels the album \\"[doodles] amiably\\" and is largely short on ideas but praises the \\"charming\\" title track. Audio felt the album, with its \\"bleak industrial tones,\\" pinpointed where Paterson began to \\"lose his way.\\" John Bush of AllMusic similarly felt that the album provided the first hint \\"that the Orb might have taken their work a bit too far,\\" and considered \\"Alles Ist Schoen\\", with its \\"beautiful ambient grooves\\", to be the album's highlight. ==Legacy and aftermath== Critics dispirited by Paterson's direction on Pomme Fritz began to unfavourably compare him to \\"acid casualty\\" Syd Barrett of Pink Floyd, and the album ultimately became the first of several \\"perplexing and difficult\\" albums that challenged the Orb's closest fans, followed shortly by the accompanying side-project album FFWD (1994), which continued to split fans between those enjoying their new direction and those who \\"cried over the loss of old Orb,\\" according to the Spin Alternative Record Guide. FFWD, a collaboration between Paterson, Weston and Fehlmann of the Orb and guitarist Robert Fripp, saw Weston briefly return to a musician's role within the Orb, before he left the group to focus on his solo material. Rob Young of The Wire described Pomme Fritz as one of the Orb's lesser known and more experimental records. Ambient producer Robert Rich is a fan of Pomme Fritz and cited it as one of several Orb albums where Paterson \\"breaks his own recipe.\\" In an interview with The Wire, Richard Norris of Psychic TV compared \\"We're Pastie to Be Grill You\\" to Brian Eno and the Residents, and its intro to Joe Meek's \\"I Hear a New World\\". Paterson would later refer to Pomme Fritz as a personal favourite, \\"an album for real Orb fans\\" and as \\"the forgotten Orb album.\\" In an interview with Paterson, Sean O'Neil of Philadelphia City Paper felt that the album was \\"amazing\\" and \\"extraordinarily ahead of its time,\\" while Paterson himself concurred it was \\"about five years too early.\\" Reflecting upon the album to Jonny Mugwump of The Quietus, who called the album \\"really out-there processed noise,\\" Paterson said: ==Track listing== Side one #\\"Pomme Fritz (Meat 'N Veg)\\" – 9:04 #\\"More Gills Less Fishcakes\\" – 8:05 #\\"We're Pastie To Be Grill You\\" – 7:15 Side two #\\"Bang 'Er 'N Chips\\" – 7:47 #\\"Alles Ist Schoen\\" – 7:17 #\\"His Immortal Logness\\" – 2:03 ==ReferencesExternal links== * Category:The Orb albums Category:1994 EPs Category:Island Records EPs ","title":"Pomme Fritz"},{"id":"5560752","text":"Anthony Avent (born October 18, 1969) is a retired American professional basketball player who was selected by the Atlanta Hawks in the first round (15th pick overall) of the 1991 NBA Draft.

In 1991, the full LP was issued by RPM Records. In 1998, The Wire listed the album as one of \\"100 Records that Set the World on Fire (When No One Was Listening)\\". ==Production== The Blue Men were originally the West Five, a skiffle group from Ealing in London. In addition to I Hear a New World, they also recorded under the name of Rodd, Ken and the Cavaliers for Meek. The tracks were recorded at his Holland Park flat and at Lansdowne Studios. The album was Meek's pet project. He was fascinated by the space programme, and believed that life existed elsewhere in the solar system. This album was his attempt \\"to create a picture in music of what could be up there in outer space\\", he explained. \\"At first I was going to record it with music that was completely out of this world but realized that it would have very little entertainment value so I kept the construction of the music down to earth\\". He achieved this as a sound engineer by blending the Blue Men's skiffle/rock-and-roll style with a range of sound effects created by such kitchen-sink methods as blowing bubbles in water with a straw, draining water out of a sink, shorting out an electrical circuit and banging partly filled milk bottles with spoons; however, one must listen carefully to detect these prosaic origins in the finished product. Another feature of the recordings is the early use of stereophonic sound. The first, eponymous track on the album is the only one to feature conventional vocals. Most of the others are instrumentals; however, some feature high-frequency vocals in the style of The Chipmunks, Pinky and Perky and The Nutty Squirrels. Meek also wrote liner notes for each track to set the scene for each piece; for instance, the notes for \\"Magnetic Field\\" read, \\"This is a stretch of the Moon where there is a strange lack of gravity forcing everything to float three feet above the crust, which with a different magnetic field from the surface sets any article in some sections in vigorous motion, and at times everything is in rhythm\\". ==Release history== The LP was scheduled to be released by Joe Meek's Triumph Records label in May 1960, but only a 4-track 7-inch EP (part 1) was released with only 99 copies circulating. Only a few demo/preview copies of the LP are known to exist. The re-releases are dubbed from these discs. A second EP was planned, but never appeared; only the sleeve was printed. This (and the cancellation of the album) was due to financial problems at the label, which resulted in Meek's leaving Triumph. The band, too, drifted away and returned to the live circuit. Four compositions from I Hear a New World were also used on the 1961 album Dream of the West by The Outlaws. The songs were retitled to fit to the theme of the album: \\"Orbit Around the Moon\\" became \\"Husky Team\\"; \\"Entry of the Globbots\\" became \\"Tune for Short Cowboys\\"; \\"The Bublight\\" became \\"The Outlaws\\" and \\"Valley of the Saroos\\" became \\"Spring is Near\\". ==Legacy== It was described as having a \\"profound influence on artists as diverse as Steven Stapleton and Saint Etienne\\".discogs.com/lists 100 Records That Set The World on Fire (When No One Was Listening) The title song was covered by the Television Personalities, Mark Sultan and They Might Be Giants in 2004. ==Personnel== ;The Blue Men * Rod Freeman (group leader) – guitar, vocals * Ken Harvey – tenor sax, vocals * Roger Fiola – Hawaiian guitar * Chris White – guitar * Doug Collins – bass * Dave Golding – drums ==Track listing== 1960 original ;Side 1 #Magnetic Field #Around the Moon ;Side 2 #Entry of the Globbots #Valley of the Saroos 1991 reissue ;Side 1 #\\"I Hear a New World\\" 2:44 #\\"Globb Waterfall\\" 3:15 #\\"Entry of the Globbots\\" 3:09 #\\"Valley of the Saroos\\" 2:50 #\\"Magnetic Field\\" 3:10 #\\"Orbit Around The Moon\\" 2:49 ;Side 2 #\\"The Bublight\\" 2:43 #\\"March of the Dribcots\\" 2:07 #\\"Love Dance of the Saroos\\" 2:33 #\\"The Dribcots' Space Boat\\" 2:16 #\\"Disc Dance of the Globbots\\" 2:15 #\\"Valley of No Return\\" 3:07 ==Releases== *The Blue Men, directed by Rod Freeman: I Hear A New World – Part 1 (EP, Triumph Records RGX-ST5000, March 1960) \\"Entry of the Globbots\\", \\"Valley of the Saroos\\", \\"Orbit Around the Moon\\", \\"Magnetic Field\\" *The Blue Men, directed by Rod Freeman: I Hear A New World – Part 2 (EP, Triumph Records RGX-ST5001, unreleased) \\"Globb Waterfall\\", \\"The Dribcots' Space Boat\\", \\"Love Dance Of the Saroos\\", \\"The Bublight\\" * LP, Triumph Records TRX-ST9000 scheduled for May 1960) * CD (RPM Records RPM502) Joe Meek – \\"I Hear a New World\\" (the front cover credits Meek, and the back credits Rod Freeman and the Blue Men; also includes audio and film clips of interviews with Meek) ==ReferencesBibliography== * == Further reading == *Barry Cleveland, Creative Music Production: Joe Meek's Bold Techniques (Vallejo, California: MixBooks, 2001) *Barry Cleveland, Joe Meek's Bold Techniques, Second Edition (Redwood City, California: ElevenEleven, 2013) *Barry Cleveland, Joe Meek's Bold Techniques, Second Edition (electronic) (Redwood City, California: ElevenEleven, 2013) *R.

Schoeps GmbH, known as Schoeps Mikrofone, is a German manufacturer of professional studio condenser microphones for recording and broadcast. The privately owned company is based in Karlsruhe, south-west Germany, and was founded in 1948. ==Microphones== All microphones made by Schoeps employ traditional (i.e. externally polarized, not electret) condenser transducers, and use small-diaphragm, single-diaphragm capsules, even in microphones which offer two or three different directional patterns. All models introduced since 1973, as well as some models from even earlier, have featured transformerless output circuitry. Colette The Schoeps \\"Colette\\" (CMC) series of microphones is a series of four amplifiers, for different powering schemes, and about 20 capsules, for different directional patterns and/or frequency response characteristics; any capsule of the series is compatible with any of the amplifiers. This was the first type of microphone to let the user separate the capsule from the amplifier (body) of the microphone, via \\"active\\" accessories, e.g. thin, flexible cables, or \\"goosenecks\\", for the sake of a less obtrusive microphone setup. In this type of arrangement, the initial amplification stage of the microphone is located in the accessory, at the point where the capsule is connected; this helps to prevent interference or signal losses. Most capsules of the CMC series are also available as one-piece compact microphones (\\"CCM series\\"). The circuitry is miniaturized so that each complete microphone is only a few millimeters longer than the corresponding \\"Colette\\" capsule would be. This simplifies installation and reduces the risk of interference in situations which would ordinarily require the use of Colette active accessories. However, since these microphones lack the modular construction of the CMC series, their capsules are not interchangeable. Historical microphones In the vacuum-tube era, Schoeps M 221-series microphones, especially the model M 221 B, were widely used in studios and for live orchestral recording. Their circuitry is based on the Telefunken AC 701k vacuum tube. They were introduced in 1954 and manufactured until the 1970s; many are still in use today. One particular model of Schoeps microphone created for French radio (the CMT 20 series, 1964) has the historical distinction of being the first phantom-powered condenser microphone on the studio market. ==See also== *List of microphone manufacturers ==ReferencesExternal links== *Schoeps Mikrofone Category:Audio equipment manufacturers of Germany Category:Companies based in Baden-Württemberg Category:Companies based in Karlsruhe Category:Microphone manufacturers Category:Manufacturing companies established in 1948 Category:German brands ","title":"Schoeps"},{"id":"5560792","text":"Pinocchio 3000 (or P3K, Pinocchio the Robot) is a 2004 computer-animated science fantasy film distributed by Christal Films. Like A.I. Artificial Intelligence (2001), it is a futuristic science fiction interpretation of the classic 1883 novel The Adventures of Pinocchio by Carlo Collodi. In this film Pinocchio is a robot brought to life by tapping into a city's power surge, rather than a puppet animated by magic. The film centers on the basic story of Pinocchio attempting to fit into living with humans, having difficulties, becoming frustrated with them, and eventually overcoming them. Most of the base elements and characters have been used, in different forms in other adaptations of Pinocchio. The story takes place in the town of Scamboville, a futuristic city constantly under development under the reign of its namesake, Scamboli. ==Plot== An old inventor named Geppetto creates a robot, named Pinocchio, as his son. Meanwhile, an evil mayor named Scamboli is building a technological city called \\"Scamboville\\" to get rid of nature. He also hates all children, except for his beloved daughter, Marlene. When Marlene expresses concerns to Scamboli about there being no space for children to have fun, he sets out to make a kids-only theme park called \\"Scamboland\\". That night, Geppetto and Spencer the Penguin are preparing to make Pinocchio come to life. But Scamboli has seized control of the city mains to light up his theme park for the Grand Opening, so, Geppetto has no choice but to steal his electricity. Suddenly, Scamboland has a power outage and the children leave. After Pinocchio comes to life, much to his family's delight, Cyberina the fairy appears. She decides to grant Geppetto's wish to turn Pinocchio into a real boy if he learns about right and wrong. The next morning, Pinocchio is walking his way to school with Spencer when he meets up with Zach, Cynthia and Marlene. Marlene challenges Pinocchio to an Imagination game, hosted by Cyberina. Marlene wins the game, but Pinocchio, who believes he's done better than Marlene, snatches the medal from her. As he runs away, he comes across Scamboli's robotic henchmen, Cabby and Rodo, who take Pinocchio to see Scamboli. While they talk to each other, Pinocchio says, \\"Life would be great if kids were more like us\\", sparking an idea in Scamboli's diabolical brain. With the true opening of Scamboland, he makes Pinocchio into an attraction, but when Geppetto gets word of this, he tries to convince him to come home. While Pinocchio performs at a concert, Scamboli kidnaps Geppetto. Afterward, all the children board a roller coaster ride called \\"A Whale of a Change\\", which transforms all of them into \\"Scambobots\\". Meanwhile, Pinocchio gives Marlene her medal back and befriends her, and they spend the night together at Marlene's private garden. As they awaken the next morning, Marlene is crestfallen to find that Scambobots have destroyed her garden. Hearing Pinocchio laughing at her dismay, she gives the medal to him and revokes her vow of friendship. But Pinocchio, realizing that he had accidentally helped Scamboli, leaves to find his Dad. He returns home, but finds that his father isn't there, but Spencer is. He tells Pinocchio that he went off to get him, so they head off to find him, only to find Scamboli turned Geppetto into a robot to kill Pinocchio. After Spencer blinds Scamboli with his camera and steals the remote that controls Geppetto and the other Scanbobots, Pinocchio and Spencer hide out in the \\"Tunnel of Danger\\" ride, where Scamboli manages to trap them. Marlene arrives and helps Pinocchio to avoid the tunnel's many dangers. However, Scamboli incapacitates Marlene, so he can kill Pinocchio with a laser gun. Pinocchio uses the medal to shield himself from the laser, causing the beam to reflect back at Scamboli and destroy his weapon. Meanwhile, Cabby accidentally gave Geppetto the remote that controls all Scambobots, getting them fired. Geppetto then commands the robots to get Scamboli. Scamboli attempts to escape in Cabby's shuttle, but is caught by a Scambocop. It tosses Scamboli inside a shuttle and flies down to the Whale ride. Pinocchio, Geppetto, Marlene and Spencer go to turn the robots back into children. Soon it's Geppetto's turn, but Scamboli presses a button to stop the machines. Pinocchio goes inside the whale and tries to fix it. Pinocchio finds the out-of-reach button. But Scamboli starts to attack him. So he begins to tell lies about how great Scamboli's personality is. This causes Pinocchio's nose to reach long enough to hit the button, causing the carts to start moving again and Scamboli gets caught in the ride. Pinocchio then realizes that everything was his fault. Cyberina appears, Pinocchio tells her that he has learned about Right and Wrong and turns Pinocchio into a real boy and Geppetto back into a human. Suddenly, Scamboli, turned into a robot, appears and Marlene is shocked. Cyberina borrows Cynthia's \\"Funbrella\\" to make sunshine and bring back all the plants Scamboli has destroyed. It ends with Spencer taking a picture of Pinocchio, Geppetto and Marlene. ==Characters== ;Geppetto family * Pinocchio, voiced by Sonja Ball, is an artificial intelligence designed by Geppetto. In this, his nose doesn't so much grow and retract, a feature installed by Cyberina. While initially entertaining the idea of becoming human, after being discriminated against he defensively adopts a position of (possibly righteous) superiority to humans, as he has a faster processing brain and more extensive imagination circuits. When he is cheated out of his victory in an imagination contest with Marlene, he snatches the trophy medal from her. This object becomes a strong component in the story later. :Despite his robot pride, he gains an appreciation for life and humans through his father and in befriending Marlene, and possesses a desire to be accepted by children, even if it means co-operating with the evil Scamboli. * Geppetto, voiced by Howard Ryshpan, is a robot scientist who builds a robot named Pinocchio. He is the father of Pinocchio and is overprotective of Pinocchio. He caused a blackout at the opening of Scamboland for enough electricity to power his robot son Pinocchio. He gets annoyed with Spencer the Cyber Penguin for talking about his Penguin relatives and tells him to zip it. He lives inside the automated house with computers. He also tries to rescue Pinocchio from the Scamboland theme park. * Spencer, voiced by Howie Mandel, is a robotic talking penguin who accompanies Pinocchio on his adventure for some of the time, attempting to help him make moral decisions, guide him through the city, and avoid danger. He wears a suit and monocle like Disney's interpretation of Jiminy Cricket, and is obviously meant to fill the said characters role. Unlike in the Disney tale, he is not employed by Cyberina (the Blue Fairy interpretation) and does not play as strong a role in the story. He is a bit clumsy and laid-back, and is shown to be Geppetto's assistant. * House, voiced by Ellen David is Geppetto's house has an artificial intelligence which can control the doors, windows, and other appliances. This is a build upon the concept of intelligent homes already in progress with technological habitation designs. ;Scamboli Family * Mayor Scamboli or Combinard voiced by Malcolm McDowell, is the main antagonist of the movie. He is the mayor of the city, a widower who raises his little girl alone. He has ambitions to transform the city, removing all signs of nature and replacing it with aesthetic metal and technology. He does greatly love his daughter and is very protective of her. He is controlling, and sees children and life as a random factor he cannot account for, motivating him to transform both into something he understands: metal. * Marlene or Marlène, voiced by Helena Evangeliou is Scamboli's daughter, and initially is portrayed as a stereotypical spoiled rich girl. It is eventually revealed that she is a more complex character, interested in ecological preservation and semi- technophobic. This may be the root of her initial disdain for Pinocchio. She is also revealed to be Pinocchio's romantic interest. She is torn between her love for her father and the environment, as he refuses to stop attacking it. She wears her hair in pigtails, kept back with a series of coloured hooplike hair bands. * Cab, voiced by Matt Holland, and Rodo, voiced by Jack Daniel Wells, are Scamboli's robots are under both his and his daughter Marlene's command, and the lack of seniority in command structure is later evidenced when they zoom back and forth confused under conflicting commands from the two of them. They appear and are stupid, probably responsible for Marlene's stereotyping of robots, and a source of physical humour in the movie. Cab is a tall and lanky yellow robot, Rodo is a short red robot that resembles a porcupine. Pinocchio initially feels kinship with these two and begins to espouse how much more intelligent robots are with them, but then discovers that he is rather a unique case. Are based on the Fox and the Cat. ;Miscellaneous characters * Cyberina, voiced by Whoopi Goldberg, is the robotic fairy of the city. Her name is a play on the name Sabrina, with the word Cyber inputted, or possibly an extension of the word Cyber similar to Ballet and Ballerina, implying she is one who is proficient with cybernetics. She is based on the character the Blue Fairy from the original story. :Whether or not she has real magical powers is unknown, as she doesn't actively use them. She does however have a large grasp over various technologies and the ability to implement them. She promises to help Pinocchio figure out how to be a real boy, saying he must learn the difference between right and wrong to do so. She plays a stronger role in the story than in most interpretations, and with a large amount of comic relief, influenced by her voice actress, Whoopi Goldberg's personality and appearance. :She wears eccentric glasses, and has a mermaid-like lower body through which she can fly, and sparking circuits coming from the top of her head, reminiscent of Whoopi's hair, albeit standing straight up, as if charged with static electricity. * Zack, voiced by Bobby Edner, and Cynthia, voiced by Gabrielle Elfassy, playing a minor role, representing other children, these children are introduced as the example of average kids living in Scamboville. They appear throughout the story, and seem to be friends of Marlene. * Scambocop, voiced by Terrence Scammell, is a robot policeman who patrols the skyways in a flying police car in Scamboville. He is also a number 12. He is a strict police officer who tries to keep the skyways safe. He tells Zack who jumped to another building saving the flower he is trespassing in a restricted zone. He also chases after Pinocchio in the flying taxi bus. And end chases too Scamboli in the flying taxi bus but his flying police car it was broken. ==Music== The musical score, by James Gelfand, is quite varied, ranging from pop to soft kid's music. It has been designed with a modern appeal to kids, but pleasant enough for adults. In one instance, Pinocchio sings onstage. The movie's theme song is What's the Difference? expressing Pinocchio's feelings regarding his life as a robot. ==See also== *List of animated feature films ==External links== * Category:2004 films Category:2004 computer-animated films Category:2000s fantasy films Category:2004 science fiction films Category:2000s French animated films Category:Canadian films Category:English-language films Category:Canadian animated fantasy films Category:Canadian animated science fiction films Category:Pinocchio films Category:2000s children's fantasy films Category:French animated fantasy films Category:French animated science fiction films Category:German animated fantasy films Category:German animated science fiction films Category:Spanish animated fantasy films Category:Spanish animated science fiction films Category:Animated films based on children's books Category:Animated films about robots Category:Environmental films ","title":"Pinocchio 3000"},{"id":"5560800","text":"Map of area code 734 in Michigan. 734 is an area code in the North American Numbering Plan.

He was the eldest son and successor of Landulf the Old. Like his father, he supported Siconulf against Radelchis in the civil war dividing the Principality of Benevento in the 840s. It was Lando who, in early 849, solicited the Emperor Louis II to arbitrate the claims of the two claimants and resolve the ongoing war which had brought Saracen mercenaries to the Mezzogiorno. In Louis's partition, Capua was made part of the Principality of Salerno, but Lando did not long obey Siconulf his overlord. Instead he allied with Duke Sergius I of Naples. To cement the alliance, Lando married his second-eldest son Landulf, the gastald of Suessola, to Sergius' daughter. During the minorities of Princes Sico and Adhemar, Lando dominated Salerno. The Salernitans took exception to rising Capuan influence and Adhemar called upon Guy I of Spoleto to intervene on his behalf. Lando responded by allying the Prefect Marinus of Amalfi to his side. He even married his brother Pando to Marinus' daughter. In the subsequent war, Guy ravaged the lands and conquered some of the territory of Landenulf, gastald of Teano, Lando's brother, but Lando himself came out unharmed. In May 859, a massive joint expedition of Salerno, Naples, Amalfi, and Suessola marched on Lando. Lando was in a paralysis at that time and his son Lando II took up arms to defend the city of Capua. He defeated the forces sent against them at the bridge of Teodemondo over the Volturno. Lando did not long survive this great victory. One of his last acts was another marital alliance, this time with Guaifer, a Salernitan nobleman who had found shelter in Capua during the reign of Adhemar. Guaifer married Lando's daughter Landelaica and, upon returning to Capua, seized power with the support of the people. Lando had moved—against his wishes—the site of Capua definitively from its old location to the new hill of Triflisco in 856. He built a monastery at Teano and died probably in 861 (possibly in 860). He left by his wife Aloara five sons: Lando (II), Landulf (of Suessola), Landenulf, Pando, and Peter; and left a daughter, Landelaica, who married Guaifer of Salerno. ==Sources== *Erchempert.

He was the second of three sons born to Emily Ellsworth (née Fowler) Ford (1826–1893) and Gordon Lester Ford (1823–1891), a lawyer who owned a library comprising 100,000 books and 60,000 manuscripts, dealing mainly with colonial and revolutionary American history. His two brothers were noted historian Worthington Chauncey Ford and novelist and biographer Paul Leicester Ford, who suffered a spinal injury in early youth that prevented him from attending school. Through his maternal grandmother, the former Harriet Webster (wife of scholar William Chauncey Fowler), Malcolm was a great-grandson of lexicographer and textbook pioneer Noah Webster, who was a lifelong friend of Emily Dickinson. ==Career== In his heyday during the 1880s, he was three times the American National Champion as \\"All Around Athlete\\", a competition which was the equivalent of today's decathlon. The event consisted of ten events (three of which are different from those which are run today). He also excelled in individual events. In 1885 and 1886 he was the winner at the National Championships of the long jump and 100 and 200 yard dash, a \\"triple\\" which was not accomplished again until Carl Lewis did it in 1983. Ford's father and the Ford family strongly opposed his participation in athletics and he was disinherited because of his refusal to give up competition. He also twice endured scandals for competing as a professional and was banned from amateur competition. During his marriage, Malcolm was employed as a business executive. At other times he worked as a journalist (his articles on track and field events were published in Outing magazine). He launched his own publications twice, but both were failures.Dubois, Paul Z., Paul Leicester Ford: an American man of letters 1865-1902, New York: B.

Neighbouring communities Herbstein borders in the north on the community of Lautertal and the community of Wartenberg, in the east on the communities of Großenlüder and Hosenfeld (both in Fulda district), in the south on the community of Grebenhain, and in the west on the town of Schotten. Constituent communities The town consists of the main town of Herbstein and also the outlying centres of Altenschlirf, Lanzenhain, Schlechtenwegen, Steinfurt, Rixfeld, Schadges and Stockhausen. The last named community, Stockhausen, is particularly old, having had its first documentary mention in 882 when it was identified as a fief of the Fulda Abbey. It is believed, however, to date back much further than that. ==History== Herbstein had its first documentary mention in 1011 in a donation document from the monastery at Fulda. In 1262, Herbstein was granted town rights. Until 1802 the town belonged to the Princely Abbey (Fürstabtei) of Fulda. There followed a short time of changing leadership until the town passed to the Grand Duchy of Hesse in 1810. As part of Hesse's municipal reforms, the formerly independent municipalities of Altenschlirf, Lanzenhain, Schlechtenwegen and Steinfurt were amalgamated into the town of Herbstein with effect on 31 December 1971. Rixfeld, Schadges and Stockhausen followed on 1 August 1972. ==Politics== Town council The municipal elections on 11 March 2011 yielded the following results: * CDU 9 seats * SPD 7 seats * FW (citizens' coalition) 7 seats Coat of arms Herbstein's civic coat of arms in its present form seems to have originated in the 17th century. Before that, the arms were a simple cross from the arms of the Fulda Abbey. The figure in the arms is Saint James the Elder, and the two crossed staffs on the inescutcheon are symbols associated with him – he was beaten to death with clubs. The arms were conferred on Herbstein in 1952. Partnerships The town of Herbstein maintains partnerships with the following places: * Oelegem (part of Ranst) near Antwerp, Belgium, since 1968 * Hévíz, Hungary, since 1995. ==Economy and infrastructure== Ever since a thermal spring was bored in 1976, the town has been increasingly gearing its activities towards running a spa. In 1980, a thermal orthopaedic bath (of a kind known in German as a Bewegungsbad – \\"movement bath\\") opened in Herbstein and in 1994 the Kurmittelhaus – a place offering treatments for various complaints – was dedicated. In 2000 these efforts were at last crowned when the town had the title \\"Heilbad\\" – \\"Healing Bath\\" – bestowed upon it. ==Sundry== Within Herbstein's bounds lay the geographical centre point of the old West Germany. ==References== Category:Vogelsbergkreis Category:Grand Duchy of Hesse ","title":"Herbstein"},{"id":"5560884","text":"Lycia Naff (born August 29, 1962) is an American dancer, actress, and journalist.

Marshall Radar Observatory (or MRO) is a McGill University facility in Sainte-Anne-de-Bellevue, Quebec, Canada housing several weather radars and other meteorological sensors, many of them running around the clock. It is one of the components of the McGill Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences department where students in remote sensing perform their research. Furthermore, the main radar is part of the Canadian weather radar network, was on a contract with the Meteorological Service of Canada, as well as a research device, up to October 3, 2018. ==Purpose== The main focus of the MRO is teaching and research. The group upgrades and designs radars, develops new ways to process the radar signals and use the resulting data, and performs research on the physics of weather events and their prediction. Results of the research are published in scientific journals and transferred for use by the weather office. ==History== In 1862, a first Weather Observatory was built by McGill University. The instruments were donated by Dr. Charles Smallwood (MD), who had personally taken weather data with them since 1840. This station became one of the first in the weather station network set up after the telegraph became ubiquitous. In 1943, \\"Project Stormy Weather\\" was assigned to J.S. Marshall by the Department of National Defence. The aim was to find a use for noise in radar echoes that had proved to be from weather. Marshall and his doctoral student Walter Palmer later received recognition for their work on the drop size distribution in mid-latitude rain that led to the rain rate relation to radar reflectivity (Z-R relation). Following World War II, Marshall and R.H. Douglas formed the \\"Stormy Weather Group\\" at McGill University and continued their work. Different radars were used by the Stormy Weather Group to research the characteristics of precipitation at Dawson College, continuing the tradition of meteorology at McGill. It was decided to build a new facility in 1968 in Sainte-Anne-de-Bellevue, on the western tip of Montreal Island and to transfer research activity from Dawson College to this facility. This new observatory was later renamed the J.S. Marshall Radar Observatory in honor of its founder. ==Main instrument== CWMN tower and radome A 10 cm wavelength Doppler and dual-polarization radar built in 1968 and used for weather surveillance around the Montreal, Quebec area. It was part of the Canadian weather radar network, used by the local weather office to monitor weather in real time for a variety of applications, from severe weather detection to sewer flow forecasting. It was replaced by a new S-Band radar, owned by the Meteorological Service of Canada and situated in Blainville, Quebec, on October 1, 2018. The radar in McGill has been only available occasionally for research purpose thereafter. Characteristics: * Its ICAO calling identifier is CWMN. * Its coordinates are , at 50 m above sea level. * It has a large diameter antenna transmitting impulses from a klystron. * Its tower is 25 m high. * It scans the atmosphere on 24 angles from 0.5 to 34.4 degrees above the horizon in 5 minutes. * It was originally recording only reflectivities, giving position and intensity of precipitation. In 1992, it was upgraded to treat Doppler data and thus estimate the motion of the drops. It was upgraded again in 1999 with a dual polarization capability which allows direct identification of the type of precipitation (rain, snow, hail, etc...). As it is a research as well as an operational radar, the large amount of data accumulated is studied for further development in radar hardware and software capabilities. The data are correlated with the other instruments in related research. ==Other instruments== Many other devices are operated by the MRO at the site or in other locations. These varies according to the research interests pursued. Some of them are or have been: * UHF Wind profiler * Bistatic radars * X-band (3 centimeter wavelength) vertical pointing radar * Ceilometer ==ReferencesExternal links== * J.S.

They are also called specialty or topical search engines. The vertical content area may be based on topicality, media type, or genre of content. Common verticals include shopping, the automotive industry, legal information, medical information, scholarly literature, job search and travel. Examples of vertical search engines include the Library of Congress, Mocavo, Nuroa, Trulia and Yelp. In contrast to general web search engines, which attempt to index large portions of the World Wide Web using a web crawler, vertical search engines typically use a focused crawler which attempts to index only relevant web pages to a pre-defined topic or set of topics. Some vertical search sites focus on individual verticals, while other sites include multiple vertical searches within one search engine. ==Benefits== Vertical search offers several potential benefits over general search engines: * Greater precision due to limited scope, * Leverage domain knowledge including taxonomies and ontologies, * Support of specific unique user tasks. Vertical search can be viewed as similar to enterprise search where the domain of focus is the enterprise, such as a company, government or other organization. In 2013, consumer price comparison websites with integrated vertical search engines such as FindTheBest drew large rounds of venture capital funding, indicating a growth trend for these applications of vertical search technology. == Domain- specific search == Domain-specific verticals focus on a specific topic. John Battelle describes this in his book The Search (2005): > Domain-specific search solutions focus on one area of knowledge, creating > customized search experiences, that because of the domain's limited corpus > and clear relationships between concepts, provide extremely relevant results > for searchers. In the domain-specific setting one can combine the tf-idf approach implemented via an inverse index with semantic approaches of semantic headers and semantic skeletons. Instead of most frequent keywords, a set of entities is extracted from a portion of text to be matched against a potential question. This allows much more flexibility due to real-time reasoning capabilities while matching questions and answers in the form of semantic headers. Any general search engine would be indexing all the pages and searches in a breadth-first manner to collect documents. The spidering in domain-specific search engines more efficiently searches a small subset of documents by focusing on a particular set. Spidering accomplished with a reinforcement-learning framework has been found to be three times more efficient than breadth-first search. ==References== Category:Internet search engines ","title":"Vertical search"},{"id":"5560996","text":"Shamiram may refer to: * Shamiram, Armenia * Shamiram (legend), a legendary Assyrian queen * Shamiram Urshan (1938-2011), Iranian singer ","title":"Shamiram"},{"id":"5561000","text":"Shamiran may refer to: *Semiramis, legendary Assyrian queen *Shamiran, Iran, a village in Mazandaran Province *Shamiran, Kerman, a village in Kerman Province *Shamiram, Armenia, also called Shamiran ","title":"Shamiran"},{"id":"5561003","text":"The Lion Has Wings is a 1939 British, black-and-white, documentary-style, propaganda war film that was directed by Adrian Brunel, Brian Desmond Hurst, Alexander Korda and Michael Powell.\\"The Lion Has Wings.\\" allmovie.com.

The Lion Has Wings was made at the outbreak of World War II and was released to cinemas very quickly. It helped convince the British government of film's value for disseminating both propaganda and information. ==Plot== The Lion Has Wings is recounted in various 'chapters' with a linking story revolving around a senior Royal Air Force (RAF) officer, played by Ralph Richardson, his wife and his family. A RAF Vickers Wellington bomber sets off on an attack on the Kiel shipyards in Germany, a pivotal event in the film The film opens with a newsreel-style documentary comparing life in Britain to life in Nazi Germany, narrated by E.V.H. Emmett in the upbeat and patriotic narrative style common to such newsreels in Britain. This mainly uses existing newsreel footage with some additional footage shot especially for the film. It includes scenes from Fire Over England with Queen Elizabeth I giving her speech to the troops at Tilbury about repelling invaders. It also compares the relaxed lifestyles and openness of the British Royal Family and the British people with the militarism of Nazi Germany by including footage from the Nazi propaganda documentary Triumph of the Will (). The second chapter shows an early bombing raid on German warships in the Kiel Canal. Although it was mainly recreated in the studio, and with special effects, it also includes some footage of the real bombers and their crews returning from the raid.Johnston and Carter 2002, p. 141. The third chapter shows an attack by Luftwaffe bombers, and how it is repelled by the RAF, with assistance from the Observer Corps and barrage balloons. The epilogue has Mr. and Mrs. Richardson taking a break from their duties, enjoying an afternoon by the river. She gives a stirring speech about how the women of Britain have in the past given their sons and lovers to the land and to the sea, and must now give them to the air. They will do so willingly to defend all that is fair and kind about the British way of life. But Wing Commander Richardson is so tired he falls asleep part way through her speech. ==Cast== *Merle Oberon as Mrs. Richardson *Ralph Richardson as Wing Commander Richardson *June Duprez as June *Flora Robson as Queen Elizabeth I (Footage taken from Fire Over England) *Robert Douglas as Briefing officer *Anthony Bushell as Pilot *Brian Worth as Bobby *Austin Trevor as Schulemburg *Ivan Brandt as officer *G.H.

Emmett as Narrator, UK (voice) *Lowell Thomas as Narrator, US (voice) ==Production== At the outbreak of war, there were fears that all film production would be halted and cinemas closed, as they were during World War I. Alexander Korda was close friends with Winston Churchill, and was very aware of current events. As soon as war was declared, Korda pulled staff from other productions to fulfill his promise to Churchill that he would have a feature propaganda film ready within one month of the outbreak of war. Since The Lion Has Wings was made before the attacks on Britain had begun, the film had to rely on existing stock footage, including sequences lifted from the air raid featurette, The Gap. Contemporary aircraft, many of which were obsolete by 1939, are a noticeable jarring element. The footage of a German bomber taking off is actually a German airliner (Focke-Wulf Fw 200); at least, it has the correct markings, but most of the biplane aircraft featured in the RAF air show were obsoletefighters. The addition of footage that was shot at operational bases, RAF Hornchurch, Hornchurch, Essex, and RAF Mildenhall, Suffolk, England, combined with studio work at Denham Studio, Denham, Buckinghamshire, UK, lent an air of authenticity to the production.Powell 1986, pp. 330, 338. To ensure rapid progress, the film had three directors, and was shot simultaneously in various locations. Michael Powell was assigned the task of recreating the RAF bomber raids, and his taut and well-structured section stands up the best, while Brian Desmond Hurst's sequences include Merle Oberon and Ralph Richardson which brought 'the undoubted stardust he managed to sprinkle with the help of his leading actors' Theirs is the Glory.

Powell later remarked that the project was 'all shop- made, edited, and directed in less than a month'.Powell 1986, p. 335. ==Reception== The speed of production and the multiple directors shows in the final result, but it is an effective 'message' film. It was all shot in 12 days, and completed in about four weeks, at a cost of just £30,000, a notable achievement in those times. Within days of its release, copies had been shipped to 60 countries. Although it is difficult to determine its actual impact on the public, The Lion Has Wings was considered a significant factor in persuading the British government to allow the film industry to continue to work, and the film was regarded as a model of how filmmakers could be an asset to the war effort.\\"The Lion Has Wings.\\" IMDb. Retrieved: 25 January 2011. Like many propaganda films, The Lion Has Wings does not tell the whole truth, but there are many elements of truth in it. The use of radar as a defensive measure was not mentioned, since it was still a secret. However, the bombing raids were shown first being reported by spies then confirmed by the Observer Corps, a tactic that was actually occurring as part of Britain's defensive measures. The film also shows Luftwaffe bombers trying to attack London, but being completely turned back by barrage balloons, which in reality had little effect on the raids. The use of RAF fighters intercepting and attacking enemy bombers at night was not feasible at that point. These errors or misinterpretations added to other lofty claims that Britain had sufficient aircraft in production and was quite ready to fight to counter the overwhelming numbers of Luftwaffe raiders; all purposeful exaggerations were intended to bolster morale. Public reaction was generally reserved, as British audiences saw The Lion Has Wings as patently simplistic and patronising; yet, it was a commercial success. Powell later derided the project as 'an outrageous piece of propaganda, full of half-truths and half-lies, with some stagey episodes which were rather embarrassing and with actual facts which were highly distorted...' Author of The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich, William Shirer recounts in his Berlin Diary on 10 June 1940 that he thought the film 'very bad, supercilious, and silly'. He was shown the film at the German Propaganda ministry while working as a CBS Radio news reporter. ==Home video== This film is available on DVD from: * DD Home Entertainment coded for Region 2 (UK & Europe) * Magna Pacific coded for Region 4 (Australasia) * Criterion as an extra included on their release of The Thief of Bagdad coded for Region 1. ==Books== Theirs is the Glory: Arnhem, Hurst and Conflict on Film takes Hurst's Battle of Arnhem epic as its centrepiece and then chronicles Hurst's life and experiences during the First World War and profiles each of his other nine films on conflict, including The Lion Has Wings..

The station is owned by Woods Communications Corporation, as part of a duopoly with Montgomery-licensed Fox affiliate WCOV-TV (channel 20); it is also sister to Montgomery-licensed low-powered Justice Network affiliate WALE- LD (channel 17). The three stations share studios on WCOV Avenue in the Normandale section of Montgomery; WIYC's transmitter is located on County Road 37 in rural Bullock County. ==History== WRJM's logo as a MyNetworkTV affiliate, used from 2006 to 2009 The station came on the air on November 24, 2000 as WRJM-TV, an affiliate of the United Paramount Network (UPN). Following the announcement of the merger between UPN and The WB to form The CW, WRJM signed an affiliation agreement with News Corporation's new upstart programming service, MyNetworkTV. The station made the switch between affiliations on MyNetworkTV's first day of broadcast, September 5, 2006. In addition to MyNetworkTV programming, WRJM-TV showed traditional syndicated fare, local programming, and sports, including Troy University and high school sports. In February 2008, the station went into receivership after defaulting on a $2.9 million loan to Citizens Bank. WRJM received an extension of time to construct its previously approved digital facilities, through November 19, 2008. Bankruptcy receiver Walter P. Lunsford filed with the FCC that the station is being offered for sale. He noted that any new owner would be responsible for construction of WRJM's digital facilities, since no construction has taken place due to the station's financial condition. On January 16, 2009, Southern Venture Capital Group began operating WRJM via a local marketing agreement; on April 20, SVCG entered an agreement to purchase the station outright for $3 million.http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/209417-Deals.php?rssid=20065&q;=Deals In August 2009 SVCG assigned the LMA and purchase agreement to Artists and Fans Network, Inc. In April 2009, the station ceased to carry MyNetworkTV programming; at the time, the station cited satellite problems and a need to reconfigure the station's equipment for its digital transition (though the station has also since dropped all syndicated programming, in favor of The Country Network (TCN), a subchannel featuring country music videos and performances). That May, WRJM suffered a lightning strike, forcing the station to end analog transmission; the station then ordered equipment to convert to digital. It would not be until 2014 when MyNetworkTV found another affiliate, low-powered WDSF-LD, which serves the immediate Montgomery area. Since WRJM's disaffiliation, most area cable systems carried WABM from the adjacent Birmingham market. The station changed its call letters to WIYC in November 2009. In 2011, WIYC dropped TCN in favor of WeatherNation, a weather information network similar to The Weather Channel.,http://montgomerytvandradio.com/2011/10/06/wiyc-48-drops-the-country- network/ It then changed affiliates again in 2013, this time affiliating with Cozi TV. On November 15, 2017, Neal Ardman filed to sell WIYC to Woods Communications Corporation for $1 million. The sale would create a duopoly with Fox affiliate WCOV-TV (channel 20); as Montgomery does not have enough television stations to permit a legal duopoly, Woods sought a failing station waiver for the purchase. The sale was completed on April 3, 2018. ==Digital channels== The station's digital signal is multiplexed: {  - ! Channel ! Video ! Aspect ! PSIP Short Name !

Sax (April 14, 1904 - March 12, 1974) was the chairman of the board of Exchange International Corporation and Chicago's former Exchange National Bank (now part of LaSalle Bank). He was president of Sax Enterprises, Inc and was a business entrepreneur who owned the Saxony Hotel, the first luxury hotel to be built in Miami Beach. ==Biography== Sax was born and raised in Peoria, Illinois. He graduated from Brown's Business College (now Midstate College) in Peoria. In 1944, Sax took over Halsted Exchange National Bank after purchasing a controlling share. He renamed the bank The Exchange National Bank of Chicago and moved it to downtown Chicago. Sax is credited with the innovation of several banking practices that have since been adopted worldwide - drive- through banking and instant loans. Later in his banking career, Sax devised such practices as open credit accounts. The Exchange National Bank had 10 teller windows and was the first in the Loop to feature show windows. The Sax family maintained control of Exchange for over thirty years. After World War II, Sax was involved in another business venture - the building of the Saxony Hotel. The Saxony was the very first luxury hotel built in Miami Beach and was the first hotel to have central air-conditioning. Among the most lavish resorts in the country, the Saxony was frequently used by heads of state and featured rooms with glorious views, air conditioning, and complementary meals. His granddaughter, Anita Sax, is a children's book author.Anita Sax was born in Chicago, Illinois and raised in Mexico City, Mexico. Her passion for writing began at a young age after a school project led her to write her first short story. She has been writing ever since. ==Accolades== In 1965, Sax received the Horatio Alger Award, an honor given to those who have achieved the American dream through hard work and adversity. Other notable Horatio Alger Award winners include former U.S. Presidents Dwight D. Eisenhower, Gerald R. Ford, and Ronald Reagan, McDonald's founder Ray Kroc and former astronaut Buzz Aldrin. == External links and references == * The Horatio Alger Association of Distinguished Americans: George D.

Flood bypasses, sometimes called floodways, often have man-made diversion works, such as diversion weirs and spillways, at their head or point of origin. The main body of a flood bypass is often a natural flood plain. Many flood bypasses are designed to carry enough water such that combined flows down the original river or stream and flood bypass will not exceed the expected maximum flood flow of the river or stream. Flood bypasses are typically used only during major floods and act in a similar nature to a detention basin. Since the area of a flood bypass is significantly larger than the cross-sectional area of the original river or stream channel from which water is diverted, the velocity of water in a flood bypass will be significantly lower than the velocity of the flood water in the original system. These low velocities often cause increased sediment deposition in the flood bypass, thus it is important to incorporate a mantaince program for the entire flood bypass system when it is not being actively used during a flood operation. When not being used to convey water, flood bypasses are sometimes used for agricultural or environmental purposes. The land is often owned by a public authority and then rented to farmers or ranchers, who in turn plant crops or herd livestock that feed off the flood plain. Since the flood bypass is subjected to sedimentation during flood events, the land is often very productive and even a loss of crops due to flooding can sometimes be recovered due to the high yield of the land during the non-flood periods. ==Examples== * Bonnet Carré Spillway * Eastside Bypass * Yolo Bypass Category:Hydraulic engineering Category:Hydrology Category:Flood control ","title":"Flood bypass"},{"id":"5561110","text":"Wilderness is the debut studio album by the art rock band Wilderness.

This album initially attracted no interest from major record companies, so the band pressed a limited run of 3,000, hand-stamped their logo on the cardboard sleeve and signed them all. After unqualified endorsement from BBC Radio 1 presenter Simon Bates and others, media interest resulted in a recording contract with Arista Records, who re-released the album under the same title. After that they released Ready, Itchy Feet and Brand Loyalty albums and regularly toured through Europe. They briefly disbanded after recording a live album Bye Bye Blues (1983), but reformed soon afterwards. In the new millennium they recorded albums such as Stepping Out (2002) and Thank You Brother Ray (2004), which paid tribute to Ray Charles. Now in their thirty-ninth year as a band, they still perform across Europe with the same line-up. ==Discography== Albums * The Official Blues Band Bootleg Album (1980). #40 UK * Ready (1980). #36 UK * Itchy Feet (1981). #60 UK * Brand Loyalty (1982) * Bye-Bye Blues (1983) * These Kind of Blues (1986) * Back for More (1989) * Fat City (1991) * Homage (1993) * Wire Less (1995) * Live at the BBC (1996) * 18 Years Old and Alive (1996) * The Best of The Blues Band (1999) US only * Brassed Up (1999) * Scratching on my Screen (2001) * Green Stuff (2001) * Stepping Out (2002) * Be My Guest (2003) (Best of guest appearances) * Thank You Brother Ray (2005) * Few Short Lines (2011) * The Rooster Crowed (2018) Compilation Albums *Live At Kent Custom Bike Show (1988) Cassette only Chart EP * \\"Maggie's Farm\\"/\\"Ain't It Tuff\\"/\\"Diddy Wah Diddy\\"/\\"Back Door Man\\" (1980) No. 68 - UK Singles * \\"Come On In\\" / \\"The Blues Band Song\\" (1980) * \\"Find Yourself Another Fool\\" / \\"SUS Blues\\" (1980) * \\"Nadine\\" / \\"That's All Right\\" (1980) (Two live tracks issued free with early copies of Ready) * \\"Who's Right, Who's Wrong?\\" / \\"Itchy Feet\\" (1981) * \\"Come On\\" / \\"Green Stuff\\" (1981) * \\"Take Me Home\\" / \\"So Bad\\" (1982) * \\"Hey Hey Little Girl\\" / \\"SUS Blues\\" (1982) (Limited edition live single) * \\"Seemed Like a Good Idea\\" / \\"Rolling Log\\" (1982) * \\"Blue Collar\\" / \\"Duisburg Blues\\" (1989) (Promo for Back for More) DVDs * Across Borders - Live (2004) * The Blues Band in Concert : Steppin' Out On Main (2004) * The Blues Band:Bungay Jumpin' Live (2009) * The Blues Band:Official Blues Band Bootleg DVD-DeLIVEred (2009) ==ReferencesExternal links== *The Blues Band official website * Category:English blues rock musical groups Category:Musical groups established in 1979 Category:English blues musical groups ","title":"The Blues Band"},{"id":"5561133","text":"Elmore Spencer (born December 6, 1969) is an American retired professional basketball player who was selected by the Los Angeles Clippers in the 1st round (25th overall) of the 1992 NBA Draft.

Formerly the junction of the Union Pacific and Central Pacific Railroads, its name reflects the common appellation of train stations whose tracks and facilities are shared by railway companies. No longer a railway hub, the building remains a cultural hub: it houses the Utah State Railroad Museum, the Spencer S. Eccles Rail Center, the John M. Browning Firearms Museum, Utah Cowboy and Western Heritage Museum and the Browning- Kimball Classic Car Museum. An art gallery local and regional artists every month. The Myra Powell Gallery features traveling exhibits and the Station's permanent art collection. Union Station Research Library has an extensive collection of historic Ogden photographs and documents available to the public. The last long-distance passenger train to use Union Station was Amtrak's Pioneer in May 1997. The adjacent Ogden Intermodal Transit Center serves the Utah Transit Authority's (UTA) FrontRunner commuter rail line. ==History== On March 8, 1869, Union Pacific laid tracks through Ogden on its way to Promontory Summit to meet the Central Pacific and complete the transcontinental rail line. Four cities near this location, Corinne, Promontory, Uintah, and Ogden, competed with each other for the opportunity to house the train station that would be the junction for railroad travel in the Intermountain West. Promontory and Uintah lacked the necessary resources to house the Station. Corinne and Ogden competed for many years for the \\"Junction City\\" title, until Brigham Young donated several hundred acres of land to the two railroads on the condition that they build the yards and station in west Ogden. 1891 illustration of the first station The first station was built in 1869, a two-story wooden frame building on a mud flat on the banks of the Weber River. The building served the narrow gauge Utah Central Railroad (later Oregon Short Line) and the narrow gauge Rio Grande Western (later Denver & Rio Grande Western). Local newspapers complained about, among other things, the need to walk a quarter-mile of wood boardwalk over swampy ground to reach the station. So the Union Pacific and Central Pacific launched a joint venture, Ogden Union Railway & Depot Co. (OUR&D;), to oversee the construction and management of a new Union Station. Completed in 1889, this new structure was designed in the Romanesque Revival style, with a large clock tower in the center. Considerably larger than the old and constructed of brick, it held 33 hotel rooms, a restaurant, barbershop, and other conveniences for travelers. In 1923, a fire that began in a hotel room destroyed the station's interior and left the walls and clock tower in a fragile state. No deaths or injuries were reported, and work continued inside the first floor to some extent, but construction on a new building did not start until a stone from the clock tower fell and struck a railroad clerk, killing him instantly. Originally, the OUR&D; planned to rebuild the station to its original design, but the accident reversed this decision and a new design was proposed by John and Donald Parkinson, architects of the Caliente Depot in Nevada and the Kelso Depot in California. Station building trackside The construction of the current building was completed in 1924 in the Spanish Colonial Revival (also known as Early Christian/Byzantine) style and is built on the foundation of the earlier building. It was dedicated on November 22 of that year, with a series of publicity shots being taken. One of these shots, showing 13 young women pulling the first train to arrive at the station by ribbons, made its way into the La Domenica del Corriere, an Italian newspaper, with the headline \\"Curious American Custom\\". The ceiling of the Grand Lobby, taking up the center portion of the building, has a height of 56 feet and extends to the roof. The trusses were originally painted in bright colors with geometric designs, but have since been painted over with a faux wood grain. Murals of the construction of the Transcontinental Railroad were painted on the north and south end of the lobby. The second floors of the north and south wing were occupied by Southern Pacific, Ogden Union Railway & Depot Co., and Union Pacific Telegraph Department offices. Of special note are the two drinking fountains on either end of the Grand Lobby. These fountains, surrounded by colored mosaics, were the favorite resting spot of Ogden Union Railway & Depot Co. Superintendent Hubert Lloyd Bell. At Bell's passing in 1927 the OUR&D; placed a bronze plaque, bearing his likeness, over the fountain on the north end. The plaque reads \\"In Memory of Hubert Lloyd Bell SUPT. O.U.RY. AND D. Co., 1918–1927, A Just Man, A Friend Who Will Be Remembered\\". Plans to turn the station into a museum were first brought forward during the centennial celebration of the driving of the golden spike in 1969. It was not until 1971 when Amtrak formally took over passenger operations through Ogden that these plans were taken seriously. The station building was turned over to Ogden City on a 50-year lease in 1977 and renovations were begun to house the planned museums. At the dedication ceremony in 1978, Union Pacific ran their famous UP 8444 (now number 844) at the head of a special passenger train from Cheyenne, Wyoming, to the new museum. They also donated a steam derrick (built by Industrial Works) and a steam rotary snow plow (built by ALCO in 1912), which were the last pieces of steam-powered equipment in use on the Union Pacific System. In 1988, the State of Utah designated the Union Station as the Utah State Railroad Museum to handle the railroad artifacts. This spurred a series of donations by the Union Pacific through the years, including UP 6916, a DD40AX \\"Centennial\\" (one of the largest locomotives ever built), and D&RGW; 5371, the only SD40-T2 \\"Tunnel Motor\\" in its original Denver & Rio Grande Western paint scheme. Railroad equipment was brought in from other places, like UP 833, an FEF-2 class steam locomotive and the largest to be moved by truck, which was moved from Salt Lake City's Pioneer Park. The station building now houses the Utah State Railroad Museum, John M. Browning Firearms Museum, The Browning-Kimball Classic Car Museum, the Western Heritage and Utah Cowboy Museum, and a library and archives. It plays host to various conventions and events, including the annual Hostlers Model Railroad Festival, weddings, Ogden Marathon Expo, craft and bridal fairs. ==Features== Railway post office/mail terminal annex This building was constructed in 1929 to serve the needs of the United States Postal Department. It is located directly north of the Union Station building. In 1950 a flat-roofed addition was constructed on the east and was used to sort mail. The Railway Post office closed in the 1970s. Following the conversion of the station complex to a museum, an addition was constructed in between the station and the annex, connecting the two buildings and allowing year-round indoor access to the facilities in the annex. Currently the Mail Terminal Annex houses the Browning Theatre and the Browning-Kimball Classic Car Museum. Trainmen's building Trainmen's building The Trainmen's Building is the northernmost structure on the Union Station grounds. It was constructed of red brick some time between 1903 and 1923 and predates the current station building. It served as the Railway Post Office (used for sorting mail) until 1929 when the Mail Terminal Annex was constructed to the south, then was used as a crew locker room for the Ogden Union Railway & Depot Co., owner of the Union Station and in turn jointly owned by Union Pacific and Southern Pacific. Space in the building was taken up with lockers, a changing room and a lunch room. In 2006, Ogden City installed fluorescent lighting and an alarm system to the building, which up to that time had been vacant. The building is now used as a shop for the restoration of D&RGW; 223, a narrow gauge steam locomotive. Restoration is being done by the Golden Spike Chapter of the Railway & Locomotive Historical Society. Butterfly canopy Butterfly canopy, 2010 The passenger shelter along tracks 1 and 2 is the only remaining canopy of a series of five. The other four canopies were demolished in April 1969. It was built in 1928 to Southern Pacific plans and is similar to canopies at the Sacramento Station in California, and is 23 feet wide. During the peak of passenger train travel in 1927, a tunnel was built under the eleven tracks with stairways to the surface at each platform. Called the passenger subway, this tunnel allowed pedestrians to access all eleven tracks from the Grand Lobby, bypassing those tracks that were occupied by trains. When passenger service ended the tunnel was filled in for safety purposes, although when the platform was repaved in 2008 a portion of the tunnel was uncovered. Plans are to place a glass over the uncovered portion for visitors to see. Similar canopies are used at the adjacent Ogden Central Station as a reference to Ogden's railroading past. The Butterfly Canopy and platforms are host to Union Pacific's Steam Team during their east–west trips over the Transcontinental Railroad route and the former Rio Grande Soldier Summit route. The operating water column at the north end, which is connected to the Ogden City water line, allows the steam locomotives to be serviced conveniently. Laundry building The laundry operations at Union Station date to 1906, when they were carried out in the commissary building (now demolished, on the site of the current Spencer S. & Dolores Dore’ Eccles Rail Center). Soiled linens and cloth from sleeper and diner cars were removed from the trains and washed during their stop in Ogden. In 1951, Union Pacific constructed a 100 by 180 foot brick building for the express purpose of washing laundry; prior to this time excess laundry that was not able to be handled in the commissary building was sent out to commercial facilities. The building was constructed to centralize the Union Pacific's laundry operations and to cut costs by an estimated fifty percent. It was the only laundry facility constructed by the Union Pacific and was expected to pay for itself within three years. Laundry was sent to Ogden from all ends of the Union Pacific Lines, and even took in laundry from Sun Valley, Idaho; West Yellowstone Lodge; Bryce Canyon National Park; Zion National Park; and Grand Canyon National Park, as well as other resorts and hotels. The use of the latest equipment, such as nine Troy Electromatic washers; 42 individual pressers; and seven diesel powered Vapor-Clarkson steam generators, as well as 105 employees, gave the building a capacity to process 110,000 individual pieces of laundry during an eight-hour shift, or about 13,333 individual pieces per hour. The laundry facility was closed in 1970 and donated to the City of Ogden in 1986. It is currently vacant. Spencer S. & Dolores Doré Eccles Rail Center  The Spencer S. & Dolores Doré Eccles Rail Center (also known as the Spencer S. Eccles Rail Center) is a collection of prototype equipment from various railroads in the west, most notably Union Pacific. It occupies the spot where the Ogden Union Railway & Depot Co. (OUR&D;) Commissary Building once stood. It houses several locomotives, as well as passenger cars, freight cars, cabooses, and railroad maintenance equipment.(1) (2) (3) Locomotives ;CRGX 6751: Cargill 6751 is a General Motors' (GM) Electro-Motive Corporation (later part of GM's Electro-Motive Division (EMD)) SW1 diesel-electric switcher locomotive assembled in 1940 with construction number 1111, was one of the first SW1s that Electro-Motive built. After acquisition, the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad (B&O;) initially numbered the locomotive as No. 213, but subsequently changed the number to 8413. Leased by the Washington and Old Dominion Railroad (W&OD;) in 1968, it was one of the last locomotives to operate on the W&OD; before the railroad closed during the same year. At Google Books. After several transfers of ownership, the locomotive was acquired by Cargill, becoming Cargill No. 6751. Cargill moved the locomotive to Ogden in 1993 for use in the company's Globe Mill. Following Cargill's donation of the locomotive in 2010, the Utah Central Railway and the Union Pacific Railroad delivered it to the Utah State Railroad Museum on May 21, 2011. ;D&RGW; 223: Denver & Rio Grande Western 223 is a class C-16 Consolidation type steam locomotive built in 1881 by the Grant Locomotive Works.

It was retired in 2009 and moved into the Rail Center in 2010. ;SP 3769: Southern Pacific 3769 is a GM Electro- Motive Division GP-9 diesel-electric switcher locomotive, built in February 1957 as 5733. In the mid 1970’s it was rebuilt as a GP9R, and renumbered to 3769. ;SP 7457: Southern Pacific 7457 is the first GM Electro-Motive Division SD45 diesel-electric switcher locomotive to be built for the Southern Pacific railroad in August 1966, originally numbered 8800. It was rebuilt as an SD45R in September 1982, and renumbered to 7457. It last saw service on Donner Pass. It was donated to the Utah State Railroad Museum in 2002. ;UCRY 1237: Utah Central Railway 1237 is a 44-ton General Electric diesel-electric switcher, originally built for the U.S. Air Force with the same number in 1953. It was donated to the Utah State Railroad Museum, and subsequently leased to the Utah Central Railway where it got its current paint scheme. It has since been returned to the Museum. ;UP 833: Union Pacific 833 is an FEF-2 class steam locomotive, built by the American Locomotive Company (ALCO) in 1939. It was originally donated to the Salt Lake City in 1972, and when transferred to Ogden in 1999 it obtained the distinction of being the largest locomotive in the United States to be moved by truck. ;UP 4436: Union Pacific 4436 is an 0-6-0 steam switcher built by Baldwin Locomotive Works in 1918. It was last used in Cheyenne, Wyoming. It was donated to the City of Ogden in 1958, and moved to the Utah State Railroad Museum upon its establishment. ;UP 6916: Union Pacific 6916 is a DD40AX \\"Centennial\\" diesel-electric locomotive that GM's Electro-Motive Division (EMD) built in 1969, one of only 47 built. Retired in 1985 and donated to the Utah State Railroad Museum in 1986. ;UP X-26: Union Pacific X-26 is one of the Union Pacific gas turbine-electric locomotives (GTELs) that General Electric built in 1961. It was advertised as the \\"most powerful locomotive in the world\\". Popularly known as \\"Big Blows\\", it is one of only two that survived. ;U.S. Army 1216: USAX 1216 is a 44-ton Davenport Locomotive Works switcher that was originally used at the Tooele Army Depot in Tooele, Utah. ==Future== While the future of the Union Station will mostly involve the museums contained therein, there exists a chance of resumed Amtrak service. As recently as 2009 Amtrak was involved in feasibility studies regarding the restoration of some previously discontinued routes, including the Pioneer. As part of the study, four routes for the Pioneer were considered. While two bypass Salt Lake City, all would be routed via Ogden. With the development of nearby Ogden Intermodal Transit Center, it is most likely any future Amtrak service would connect at the Transit Center instead of the Union Station. ==See also== * National Register of Historic Places in Weber County, Utah * List of Amtrak stations * List of museums in Utah * Union Station (disambiguation) ==ReferencesExternal links== *Utah State Railroad Museum *Utah State Railroad Museum prototype equipment, from the Golden Spike Chapter R&LHS; website *Historic Union Station & Ogden 25th Street at the Utah Office of Tourism's Utah.com website.

He was the eldest son and successor of Lando I. In May 859, a massive joint expedition of Salerno, Naples, Amalfi, and Suessola marched on Capua. Lando I was in a paralysis at that time and his son Lando II took up arms to defend the city. He defeated the forces sent against them, led by Caesar and Gregory, sons of Sergius I of Naples, at the bridge of Teodemondo over the Volturno. Caesar was captured and led back to Capua in triumph. Erchempert places the battle on 8 May, the day of Michael the Archangel, whose cult was popular among the Lombards. It is therefore significant to Erchempert (a Lombard) that the Lombard Lando should defeat a largely Greek army on such a day. Lando did succeed his father when he died, but he was expelled shortly thereafter by his uncle Pando. Lando was compensated with Caiazzo, but desired to restore himself to the countship. He married a niece of Athanasius of Naples, but with this ally, he never regained the throne. ==Sources== *Erchempert.

After Simirumi's murder at the hands of Assassins in 1122, he passed to the hands of sultan, who entrusted his education to certain emir Nasr. After Mahmud's death, he attained to the post of governor of Arran under sultan Ghiyath ad-Din Mas'ud (1134–1152), who also gave late sultan Toghrul II's widow Momine Khatun and appointed Eldigüz to be atabeg of Arslanshah (son of Toghrul). His rise as the most powerful peripheral emirs of the Seljuq empire was aided by the necessity of having a large army against the frequent incursions from the neighboring Kingdom of Georgia. == Rise to power == His dynasty's powerbase was centered around Nakhchivan, from where he would direct attention to Georgia. Expanding to Arran, he gained control from Baylaqan to Shamkhor. He made himself virtually independent ruler of Azerbaijan by 1146. His marriage with Mu'mine Khatun afforded him to intervene in the dynastic strife which erupted upon Mas'ud's death in 1152. His power in Azerbaijan grew stronger when Khass Beg b. Palangari was killed on the orders of sultan Muhammad II in 1153. Eldiguz, in alliance with Ahmadili atabeg Arslan Aba waged a war against sultan and kept this alliance till 1156. Eldiguz also obtained execution of Chaghrishah, son of Mahmud II in 1155, Ganja. Alliance soon came to a conclusion when Muhammad II defeated Eldiguz in 1156 and granted Azerbaijan to Arslan Aba. Tides turned when sultan himself died in 1159 and was replaced by Suleiman Shah by Ïnanch Sonqur. He succeeded, in 1160, in deposing and possibly murdering Sulayman Shah and installing his stepson Arslanshah b. Toghrul (1160–1175) as sultan. Conferred with the rank of atabeg, Ildeniz now became a chief protector of the sultan's authority. Ildeniz then arranged a marriage between his son Pahlawan and the daughter of Inanch, amir of Rey, in order to secure the allegiance of this powerful dynasty. == Wars against Ahmadilis and Inanch == Arslanshah's reign was not accepted in Maragha and Ray, whose rulers Inanch and Ahmadilis became rivals of Eldeguzids. Inanch marched against Hamadan, in order to place his brother Muhammad on the throne in 3 August 1161 but Arslan and Eldigüz defeated him in battle, forcing Ïnanch to flee. Inanch again marched on Eldugizids in 1165, this time by aid of Bavandid ruler Hasan I (who also became Inanch's son-in- law) and Khwarazmshah Il-Arslan. Eldiguz managed Inanch's assassination in 1169 and capture of Rey, which was granted to Muhammad Jahan Pahlavan as an iqta. Although never subjugated, Ahmadilis continued rivalry with Eldiguzids until Qizil Arslan's reign. == Consolidation of power == Ildeniz then marched to Isfahan and forced the Salghurid atabeg of Fars, Zangi b. Mawdud, into submission. He also annexed Ardabil, which was ruled by atabeg Nasir al-Din Aq Qush until his own death on 30 September 1165. His son Jamal ad-Din Muhammad was granted Borujerd in return. Tabriz was also gained from Ahmadilis in 1174. He restored Arslan Shah II to his rule in Kerman in 1174 who took it from his brother Bahram Shah. Eldiguz consolidated his power to entire Iran with the exception of Mazandaran and Ahmadili controlled Maragheh. == Georgian campaign == Soon he proceeded northward to recover the city of Dvin from the Georgian attack in 1162. A coalition of Muslim rulers - Shah-Armen Seyfettin Beytemür, Ahmadili Arslan-Aba, Arzen emir Fakhr ul-Din and Saltuk II, led by Ildeniz took the fortress of Gagi, laid waste as far as the region of Gagi and Gegharkunik, seized prisoners and booty, and then moved to Ani capturing and granting it to Shaddadid emir Shahanshah ibn Mahmud. The Muslim rulers were jubilant, and they prepared for a new campaign. However, this time they were forestalled by George III, who marched into Arran at the beginning of 1166, occupied a region extending to Ganja, devastated the land and turn back with prisoners and booty. The Shaddadids ruled Ani for about 10 years as vassals of Eldgiz, but in 1174 George III took the Shahanshah as a prisoner and occupied Ani once again, appointing Ivane Orbeli as governor. == Khwarazmian affairs == Back at Hamadan, he had to deal with another invasion – this time by the Khwarezmians who planned to annex Khorasan. It's governor Muayyad Ay-Aba submitted to Eldugiz since 1157, even captured Bistam and Damghan from Khwarazmshah and defeated Shah Ghazi Rustam. However, Muayyad soon switched sides and submitted to Khwarazmshah in 1167. It was not, however, until the death of the Khwarazmshah Il-Arslan in 1172, when the threats on this sector were finally eliminated. == Death and legacy == By the time of his death around October–November 1175, Ildeniz was arguably the undisputed de facto master of many parts of the already fragmentized Great Seljuq Empire, centered on Iraq. He was buried at Hamadan, at a madrasa which he had founded. He was succeeded by his sons Muhammad Jahan Pahlavan and Qizil Arslan. Armenian author Vardan Areveltsi considered him to be benevolent towards Christians. == Family == He was married to Momine Khatun, widow of Toghrul II in 1135.

As the manager is about to be taken away, he hits Keaton over the head and knocks him out before escaping. Next we see Keaton being awoken by two angels at the foot of a large stairway which he ascends all the way to Heaven. He asks Saint Peter to be let in but is denied and is sent all the way down to Hell. However, this is all revealed to be a dream sequence as Keaton regains consciousness in the house seconds later. ==Cast== * Buster Keaton as Bank Clerk * Virginia Fox as Bank President's Daughter * Joe Roberts as Bank Cashier * Edward F.

As such it doesn't work too well today...(but) it has a certain amount of naive charm.

(1994). Collins Scottish Clan & Family Encyclopedia. (Foreword by The Rt Hon. The Earl of Elgin KT, Convenor, The Standing Council of Scottish Chiefs). pp. 120 - 121. The surname is rendered \\"Druimeanach\\" in modern Scottish Gaelic.Urquhart, Libby. (1997). The Drummonds. Published by Lang Syne Publishers Ltd. . ==History== Origins of the clan Traditional origins West of Stirling is the parish of Drymen and its name appears to have been derived from the Scottish Gaelic, dromainn which means a ridge or high ground. There is a traditional legend that states that the first nobleman to settle in Drymen was a Hungarian prince called George who accompanied Edgar Ætheling, an Anglo-Saxon prince, on his escape from William the Conqueror and the Norman conquest of England. These royal fugitives were warmly welcomed by Malcolm III of Scotland, who married one of the royal sisters, Margaret, later Saint Margaret of Scotland. Recorded origins The first chief of Clan Drummond to appear in written records was Malcolm Beg, Chamberlain of Lennox, who married a daughter of the Earl of Lennox, named Ada, before 1260. Gilbert de Drumund of Dumbarton appears on the Ragman Rolls of 1296 swearing fealty to Edward I of England. Wars of Scottish Independence Malcolm de Drummond also swore fealty to Edward I of England, however despite this, during the Wars of Scottish Independence the Clan Drummond strongly supported the cause of Scottish Independence. Malcolm Drummond fought at the Battle of Bannockburn in 1314. He is credited with the deployment of caltrops, tetrahedral iron spikes which when thrown onto the ground land with one spike uppermost to injure horses and unseat cavalry; they were highly destructive against the English cavalry. After the battle the clan was given lands in Perthshire by Robert the Bruce. Malcolm's great-granddaughter, Annabella became the mother of King James I of Scotland in 1394. The Clan Drummond gained more land in 1345 when chief John Drummond married an heiress of the Montfichets and became John Drummond of Stobhall. John's sister Margaret Drummond married David II of Scotland but they had no children. In 1357, John's daughter Annabella Drummond married John Stewart, Earl of Carrick, the future High Steward of Scotland then King as Robert III of Scotland. 15th century and clan conflicts Stobhall Castle and its chapel Sir Malcolm, the eldest great-grandson of the aforementioned Malcolm, obtained the clan home, Stobhall Castle, from his aunt Queen Margaret Drummond, David II of Scotland's wife. Chief Sir Malcolm Drummond married Isabel Douglas the Countess of Mar. He obtained the lands of Stobhall from his aunt Queen Margaret, who had first obtained it from King David II of Scotland. Sir Malcolm was murdered in 1403 by a band of Highland marauders, said to have been the Clan Stewart of Appin led by Alexander Stewart, the son of the Wolf of Badenoch. A son of Sir John Drummond and wife Elizabeth Sinclair, John Drummond, went to the Madeira Islands, where he had issue. Though quickly extinguished in male line, the surname has survived there and in Brazil, in one or another form.\\"Grande Enciclopédia Portuguesa e Brasileira\\", Vários, Editorial Enciclopédia, Lisboa, Vol. 9, pg. 308\\"Ascendência e descendência de Nicolau de Bettencourt\\", Vasco de Bettencourt de Faria Machado e Sampaio, Edição do Autor, 1.ª Edição, Lisboa 1991, Table 8 Malcolm was succeeded by his brother John, whose great-grandson, also called John, was judiciary of Scotland, a Privy Councillor, constable of Stirling Castle, and became a Lord of Parliament on 29 January 1487 as the first Lord Drummond One year of his life was spent in confinement within Blackness Castle after he assaulted the Lord Lyon, King of Arms. He had a daughter, Margaret, said to have been secretly married to King James IV, who died after a meal, together with two of her sisters. Although some say it was murder, others claim their deaths were due to food poisoning. The Battle of Knockmary was fought in 1490 by Clan Murray against the Clan Drummond and Clan Campbell, which had been engaged in a long feud. David Drummond was later executed for burning of a group of Murrays in a church. 16th century and clan conflicts romanticised Victorian-era illustration of a Drummond clansman by R. R. McIan from The Clans of the Scottish Highlands published in 1845. In 1589, Patrick, 3rd Lord Drummond, appointed his deputy kinsmen, John Drummond of Drummond-Ernoch, Royal Forester of Glenartney. It was in this post that he cut off the ears of some of the Clan MacGregor whom he had caught poaching. In revenge a party of MacGregors, aided by their cohorts the Macdonalds, attacked Drummond and cut off his head. They then proceeded to John's sister Margaret's residence, Ardvorlich Castle on the banks of Loch Earn. Her husband Alexander Stewart, the Laird of Ardvorlich, was away from home at the time the McGregors and the Macdonalds burst in, demanding bread and cheese. The MacGregors unwrapped John's bloodied head and crammed its mouth full, placing it on a platter in the middle of the dinner table for their hostess to find when she returned with food and drink for them. On seeing her beloved brother's severed head, Margaret, who was in advanced pregnancy, almost lost her reason. She fled into the woods beneath Ben Vorlich and gave birth to her son James Stewart. He grew up to be the notable Major James Stewart of the Covenanting Wars, of whom Sir Walter Scott wrote in the book, A Legend of Montrose, telling of his exploits. He vowed vengeance on the McGregors and played a major role in having the Clan proscribed. 17th century and Civil War In 1610 James Drummond, 1st Lord Madderty built Innerpeffray Castle. James Drummond, descendant of John, Margaret's father, became the first Earl of Perth in 1605,. His brother John became his successor on his death in 1611, and his sons became Earls of Perth like their father before them. Lord Drummond led his forces in support of the Covanenters against the Royalists at the Battle of Tippermuir in 1644. The chief of Clan Drummond, third Earl of Perth joined James Graham, 1st Marquis of Montrose in August 1645 and was taken prisoner at the Battle of Philiphaugh the following month. In about 1660 the grandson of James Drummond 1st Lord Madderty established a library in St Mary's chapel, the burial place of Drummonds. Later in 1751 on the same site, Robert Hay Drummond opened Scotland's first public lending library. During the battles that followed in the decades after the Civil War the Clan Drummond fought at the Battle of Killiecrankie in 1689. 18th century and Jacobite risings Jacobite rising of 1715 When James VII came to the throne in 1685, James Drummond, 4th Earl of Perth (later 1st Duke of Perth), had converted to the Catholic Faith, as did his brother, the 1st Earl of Melfort. Therefore, during the Jacobite risings, the Clan Drummond were largely supporters of the Jacobite cause and the House of Stuart. Chief James Drummond, 2nd Duke of Perth joined the Jacobites during the Jacobite rising of 1715 and fought at the Battle of Sheriffmuir. He later fled in exile to France, and his estates were forfeited. Jacobite rising of 1745 James Drummond, 3rd Duke of Perth was born in France but returned to Scotland in 1734 to live at Drummond Castle with his mother. He was one of Charles Edward Stuart's closest commanders and he was involved in the Siege of Carlisle during the Jacobite rising of 1745. Clan Drummond fought as Jacobites at the Battle of Falkirk (1746) and the Battle of Culloden in 1746. At the Battle of Culloden James Drummond, 3rd Duke of Perth was shot and later died of his wounds, he was buried at sea from a boat which was escaping to France. His brother, Lord John Drummond, went into exile in France. While their cousin, William Drummond, 4th Viscount Strathallan, was killed during the battle. For their support of the Jacobite Stewarts through the risings of 1715 and 1745 the property and titles of the Drummonds were twice forfeited. It was not until 1853, through an Act of Parliament, that the title of Earl of Perth and other forfeited titles were restored to George Drummond, who was also in the French peerage as a Baron. Adam Drummond was captured commanding Drummond's Edinburgh Volunteers Regiment that fought on the side of the British government at the Battle of Prestonpans in 1745. 20th century James Eric Drummond (1876–1951), 16th Earl of Perth, served as the first secretary-general of the League of Nations. Lord Perth, a Catholic, was also British ambassador to Rome, from 1933 to 1939, and was chief advisor on foreign publicity at the Ministry of Information during World War II. His successor, John David Drummond, was able to buy back the family home, Stobhall Castle, which has recently been sold again and its furniture auctioned. ==Clan Castles== Drummond Castle, historic seat of the chiefs of Clan Drummond *Stobhall Castle, seven miles north of Perth is a sixteenth century castle that is ranged around a courtyard. It is in the form of L-plan block with a conical roof and it houses a chapel dating from the fourteenth century that has a painted ceiling from 1630–40. The castle was held by the Drummonds from 1360 and it was the main stronghold of the Drummonds until they moved to Drummond Castle in the fifteenth century. Stobhall Castle is now once again the seat of the chiefs of Clan Drummond. *Drummond Castle, about a mile south- west of Crieff, in Perthshire stands on a rocky outcrop and dates from the fifteenth century. The castle includes a five-story tower as well as later and lower extensions. Sir Malcolm Drummond distinguished himself at the Battle of Bannockburn in 1314 and was given lands there that were originally known as Concraig. However the castle was begun by John Drummond, 1st Lord Drummond in the fifteenth century. In the 1650s the castle was badly damaged by Oliver Cromwell, after James Drummond, 3rd Earl of Perth had been active with James Graham, 1st Marquess of Montrose, and James Drummond was captured after the Battle of Philiphaugh in 1645. The castle was slighted by government troops who occupied it during the Jacobite rising of 1715. The Drummonds were forfeited for taking part in the Jacobite rising of 1745 but they recovered the Earldom of Perth in 1822, and the Drummond Earls of Perth now live at Stobhall Castle. *Newton Castle, slightly north-west of Blairgowrie in Perthshire dates from the sixteenth century but was built on the site of an older stronghold. The castle is a Z-plan tower house and was held by the Drummonds who feuded with the nearby Blairs of Ardblair. It was sacked in 1644 by James Graham, 1st Marquess of Montrose and was torched by Oliver Cromwell in 1650, however the defenders are said to have survived in the vaults while the castle burned around them. George Drummond, who was Lord Provost of Edinburgh came from the Drummond of Newton family and was responsible for the first building of New Town, Edinburgh. *Balmoral Castle was held by the Drummonds in 1390 but later passed to the Gordons and others. In 1852 it was purchased by Prince Albert, husband of Queen Victoria. *Megginch Castle was home of Cherry Drummond, 16th Baroness StrangeMegginch Castle, Perthshire rampantscotland.com.

He had little contact with his father. Instead he was raised in Southern Florida by his grandmother, and now lives in Atlanta, Georgia. As a child he listened to his father's records, but also to more popular fare such as The Jackson Five. He came to music later in life, having first worked as a teacher after earning a bachelor's degree in English from Tuskegee University and another in Communications from Auburn University. He did not begin playing music seriously until after his father's death in 1983, and then spent six years studying guitar. A well-received performance with Lonnie Mack at Atlanta's Center Stage convinced Morganfield that his career move was a good one, but dissatisfied with his craft, he returned to studying traditional blues forms and songwriting while continuing work as a teacher. He got his first break in 1996 when he and his band (\\"The Stone Cold Blues Band\\" 1996-1998) played at the Blue Angel Cafe in Chattanooga Tn. The band consisted of professional Atlanta based musicians that helped launch his career. In 1998 he then began to play the east coast that led to bigger shows like \\"The Stan Rogers Folk Fest\\" and \\"Montreal Jazz fest\\" . His first independent album,\\"Rising Son\\", was released in 1999 by Blind Pig Records. The album was recorded in Chicago, and featured Paul Oscher, Willie \\"Big Eyes\\" Smith, and Pinetop Perkins. In 2000, he won the W.C. Handy Award for Best New Blues Artist. The title cut was featured in the 2004 film A Love Song for Bobby Long. (In 1997 Taxium Records released a demo-intended recording of Big Bill Morganfield called \\"Nineteen Years Old\\" without the consent of Big Bill Morganfield. American laws do not apply as this recording was taken to Germany for release.) In 1999, Morganfield appeared at the San Francisco Blues Festival. Ramblin' Mind, Morganfield's next album, included Taj Mahal on two songs, plus his song \\"Strong Man Holler\\". Billy Branch played harmonica on the album. In 2009, Morganfield released the album Born Lover, produced by Bob Margolin and Brian Bisesi. In concert, Morganfield performs his own material with an occasional number from his father's work. He also performed at a Kennedy Center Honors tribute to his father. During the 2000s, Morganfield headlined many festivals and performed at venues around the world. ==Album discography== Big Bill Morganfield leading his band at the Red Bank Jazz & Blues Festival, June 2007 *1997 - Nineteen Years Old *1999 - Rising Son *2001 - Ramblin' Mind *2003 - Blues in the Blood *2009 - Born Lover *2013 - Blues With a Mood *2016 - Bloodstains on the Wall ==See also== *List of Auburn University people *List of guitarists by genre ==ReferencesExternal links== *Official website Category:1956 births Category:Living people Category:Singers from Chicago Category:African-American musicians Category:Tuskegee University alumni Category:Auburn University alumni Category:American blues guitarists Category:American male guitarists Category:American blues singers Category:American blues singer-songwriters Category:American male singers Category:Songwriters from Illinois Category:Blues musicians from Illinois Category:Guitarists from Chicago Category:20th-century American guitarists Category:20th-century American male musicians Category:Blind Pig Records artists ","title":"Big Bill Morganfield"},{"id":"5561503","text":"Regina Maria Roche (1764–1845) is considered today to be a minor Gothic novelist who wrote in the shadow of Ann Radcliffe. She was, however, a best seller in her own time. The popularity of her third novel, The Children of the Abbey, rivaled that of Ann Radcliffe’s The Mysteries of Udolpho. The Children of the Abbey was one of the period’s most popular novels, a sentimental Gothic Romance. Her book, Clermont, was Roche’s only real attempt at writing a truly Gothic novel, and is decidedly darker in tone than anything else she wrote. Both novels went through several editions and were translated into both French and Spanish. Clermont was one of the Northanger Horrid Novels satirized by Jane Austen in her novel Northanger Abbey. She was born in Waterford in 1764, moving to Dublin as a child and then to England in 1794 after her marriage. Her first two novels were published under her maiden name (Dalton) before the success of The Children of the Abbey and Clermont. Both were translated into French and Spanish and went through several editions. However, after her fifth novel, The Nocturnal Visit, was published in 1800, Roche suffered financial difficulties after falling afoul of a duplicitous solicitor and did not write again until 1807, after she received aid from the Royal Literary Fund. She wrote 11 more novels, most set in the rural Ireland she returned to in the 1820s, but none matched her earlier successes. After suffering bouts of depression, she died in relative obscurity in the town of her birth at the age of 81.Maria Regina Roche, The Corvey Project at Sheffield Hallam University.

He was a son of Landenulf, gastald of Teano, and grandson of Landulf I of Capua. In 879, when Landulf II died, Lando seized Calino and Caiazzo and made his son, Landulf, only an adolescent, bishop of Capua. Pandenulf, however, seized Capua and appointed his brother Landenulf as bishop. Pandenulf recognised Lando in Caiazzo, but a schism began in the Capuan church over the rightful bishop. Pope John VIII decided in favour of Landenulf, but made Landulf bishop of \\"Old\\" Capua, Santa Maria Capuavetere. Lando began building a coalition against Pandenulf. He brought on his cousins the deposed Lando II and Landulf of Suessola and the prince of Salerno, Guaifer. Pandenulf recruited to his side Gaideris, Prince of Benevento, and the Byzantine strategos Gregory. Athanasius of Naples allied with Pandenulf, but after seizing desired land in Liburia, he abandoned the count. Lando and his allies sued for peace, but treacherously seized Capua and exiled Pandenulf and Landenulf, replacing them respectively with Lando and his son. Lando warred successfully with Lando II, who had hoped to revive his own rule, and Athanasius, who was desirous of more gains in the Capua province. Lando also allied with Guy III of Spoleto against Atenulf, his own brother, the gastald of the Marsi. Erchempert here gives an indication of Lando's character, describing him as too indolent to even take action against his brother, who was then befriending his worst enemy. Lando died in 885 of natural causes. He had married a daughter of Radelgar of Benevento. He was succeeded by his brother Landenulf. ==Sources== *Erchempert.

In 1986, he was named the best footballer in the USSR and Ukraine and the 6th best footballer in Europe according to France Football. Zavarov is widely regarded to be among the greatest footballers in the history of the USSR and Ukraine, and in 2000 he was included in the Ukrainian Team of The Century according to a poll by the Ukrainsky Futbol weekly. In 2015, he refused to join the Ukrainian army in the Donbass conflict, as he did not want to see war where he grew up.http://www.gazeta.ru/sport/news/2015/02/15/n_6927205.shtml ==Club career== Zavarov started off his career in his home city of Zorya Luhansk. He played in the USSR Premier League for Zorya Luhansk (1977–79, 1982), and also SKA Rostov (1980–81). In 1983–88, he played for the Soviet-Ukrainian giants, Dynamo Kyiv, with whom he won the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup in 1985–86, scoring in the final itself. Zavarov later played for Juventus between 1988 and 1990, becoming the first Soviet player to play in Serie A; he won the Coppa Italia and the UEFA Cup under manager Dino Zoff in 1990, and also wore the iconic number 10 shirt in his first season with the team, which had formerly belonged to club legend Michel Platini, although he later switched to the number 9 shirt, and the number 10 shirt was given to Giancarlo Marocchi the following season. Although much was initially expected of Zavarov at the Turin-based club, his time with Juventus was considered to be less successful, despite his two title victories; in spite of the arrival of compatriot Sergei Aleinikov in his second season with the team, Zavarov also had difficulties settling in at the club, due to his strenuous relationship with the club's manager, Dino Zoff, and also as he struggled to learn Italian. He subsequently transferred to Nancy in 1990, where he remained for five seasons, before finally moving to Saint-Dizier in 1995, retiring after three seasons, in 1998. ==International career== Zavarov had 41 caps for the USSR, scoring six goals including two in the World Cup finals in 1986 and 1990. He also played in the Euro 1988 in which the USSR team were runners-up. ==Style of play== A creative, quick, agile and skilful midfielder, Zavarov was primarily known for his excellent technical ability, two-footedness, stamina, and tactical intelligence, and was usually deployed as an attacking midfielder or as a supporting striker, although he was also capable of playing as a deep-lying playmaker, due to his versatility, vision, and long passing accuracy. Zavarov played a key role in Valeri Lobanovski's successes with Dynamo Kyiv, and his dribbling skills and playmaking ability led his Dynamo Kyiv coach to compare him to Diego Maradona. Despite the talent he demonstrated and the success he had both with Ukrainian club Dynamo Kyiv and the Soviet national team at Euro 1988, which earned him a reputation as one of the greatest players to ever come out of the Soviet Union, his time in Italy with Juventus was less successful, and he failed to live up to initial expectations in Serie A. Due to his inconsistent displays and his lack of accuracy in front of goal, he drew criticism from the press, who also singled out his surprisingly poor work-rate and movement off the ball; he was also accused of lacking confidence, and of not being an effective assist-provider for the team. Because of his timid character, it was also argued that he lacked the necessary leadership skills to carry the team, and fill the void left by Michel Platini in the advanced midfield playmaking role during the post-Trapattoni crisis. ==Managerial career== Zavarov began his coaching career with Saint Dizier CO as a player-coach. He had a short spell as a head coach of FC Wil in 2003–04, however because he lacked the necessary UEFA licence, he was given the position of director of football with the club. He is currently manager of Ukrainian team Arsenal Kyiv. == Career statistics ==  International goals  {  style=\\"font-size:95%;\\" ! # !! Date !! Venue !! Opponent !! Score !! Result !!

He spent most of his career with Zaragoza, appearing in 327 official games and scoring 11 goals. ==Club career== Zaragoza Zapater was born in Ejea de los Caballeros, Province of Zaragoza. In 2004, he was first touted as a promising player after scoring 12 goals for hometown's Real Zaragoza in the youth leagues. The first-team manager, former Spanish international Víctor Muñoz, was impressed enough, allowing Zapater to join the first team in pre-season training. He was given his official debut on Zaragoza's first game of 2004–05, against Valencia CF in the Spanish Supercup: although the Aragonese ended up losing 0–1 he put up a solid performance overall, confirmed in the 3–1 second leg away win. At just 19, Zapater went on to feature in 31 La Liga matches during the league campaign, netting in a 2 March 2005 defeat at Real Sociedad where he was also sent off. In the following season, he helped the club finish as runners-up in the Copa del Rey – losing the final to RCD Espanyol – while also only missing three league matches; his strong tackling and the amount of fouls he committed earned him the nickname of 'The Bull', given by Diego Maradona. In the following two seasons, after renewing his contract until June 2010, Zapater remained an undisputed starter, only missing four contests combined while experiencing qualification honours to the UEFA Cup in 2006–07, and relegation the following year. Abroad In late July 2009, after being instrumental in Zaragoza's return to the top division, and already playing pre-season football with the Maños, Zapater left for Genoa C.F.C. for around €4.5 million, as the Spaniards were also immerse in a deep financial crisis. He held an emotional press conference before parting ways with his boyhood team, whilst fans paid tribute to the player dedicating a song to him. On 17 September 2009, Zapater had the distinction of scoring the first ever goal in the Europa League proper, with a fourth-minute strike against SK Slavia Prague. He started throughout most of his debut season in Serie A – his maiden appearance in the competition being marked with a goal and an assist, in a 3–2 home win over A.S. Roma– as Genoa finished in mid-table; before the end of the campaign and during the subsequent off-season he was linked with a move to several clubs, but nothing ever materialized. On 30 July 2010, Zapater was sold to Sporting CP as Miguel Veloso moved in the opposite direction. Used intermittently in his only season he did appear in 34 official games for the Lions, scoring four times. On 3 August 2011, Zapater moved to Russian side FC Lokomotiv Moscow on a free transfer, signing a five-year contract. He made his first Premier League appearance on 11 September, setting up Manuel da Costa's goal in a 4–2 win over FC Zenit Saint Petersburg; in an interview with a newspaper from his native region (El Periódico de Aragón) in late 2012, he spoke of his development in the new reality and his efforts to learn the Russian language. Return home On 19 June 2016, Zapater returned to Zaragoza after agreeing to a two-year deal. ==International career== Zapater took part in the 2005 FIFA World Youth Championship, in a Spanish team that also featured future senior internationals Cesc Fàbregas, Fernando Llorente and David Silva. He scored his first and the only goal in a 3–1 defeat to Argentina in the quarter-finals. After that, Zapater immediately established himself as an under-21 regular. ==Club statistics== {  style=\\"font-size:90%; text-align: center;\\" - !rowspan=\\"2\\"Club !rowspan=\\"2\\"Season !colspan=\\"2\\"League !colspan=\\"2\\"Cup !colspan=\\"2\\"League Cup !colspan=\\"2\\"Europe !colspan=\\"2\\"OtherIncludes Supercopa de España !colspan=\\"2\\"Total - !Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals -  rowspan=\\"6\\" style=\\"vertical-align:center;\\"Zaragoza 2004–05 31 1 1 1 - - 8 0 2 0 42 2 - center;\\" 2005–06 35 0 9 0 - - - - - - 44 0 - style=\\"text- align:center;\\" 2006–07 36 0 3 0 - - - - - - 39 0 - center;\\" 2007–08 36 2 4 0 - - 2 0 - - 42 2 - center;\\" 2008–09 39 2 1 0 - - - - - - 40 2 - style=\\"background:lemonchiffon\\" !

Kennedy sang for the band Anthrax in its formative stages when they were merely a garage band. He was a freshman in high school and was friends with a school mate of Scott Ian's then girlfriend Marge Ginsberg. Persuaded to sing with the band after hearing him mimic Ronnie James Dio it lasted a few months. Heavy Metal Albums He was never a full member of the band. In 1985 he answered an ad in \\"The Music Paper\\" and became the lead vocalist for the band Hittman. They released two albums through SPV/Steamhammer records \\"Hittman\\" in 1989 and \\"Vivas Machina\\" in 1993. Both albums were critically acclaimed. The band were featured on the covers of Kerrang! (getting a near perfect KKKK 1/2) and many other international rock magazines herald them as the next force in Hard rock. After the 1993/94 tour for \\"Vivas Machina\\" the band went into hiatus. Never officially disbanding Hittman, Dirk retreated into his home studio to explore other sides of his voice and music. Dirk is a lifelong vegetarian and animal rights advocate. Kennedy resides in New York City and has been working for years on his solo album \\"Life is Now\\", to be officially released on July 12, 2011. The album had been fully completed for some time but its release delayed. The intentional delay is from his ongoing insecurities of where his music fits in today's changing musical landscape. A fan of artists like \\"Kate Bush, Peter Gabriel and Queen\\" Dirk has long worried that an album artist in the current disposable pop market might get overlooked or worse, ignored. Reports on the album describe it as a multi-layered work of varying styles and complex harmony. A somewhat reclusive character, he reportedly left the music business out of frustration with industry politics. On April 25, 2009 Dirk was to perform with the reunited original line-up of Hittman, as co-headliners at the Keep It True Festival in Lauda-Konigshoefen Germany. The appearance was cancelled due to a personal matter involving one of Hittman's band members. In August 2009 Dirk began rehearsals with his new band, working out the live show that will coincide with the release of \\"Life Is Now\\". On May 22, 2010 Dirk played an unpublicized \\"Secret Show\\" at the Vernon Rocks Festival. The 45 minute set included eight songs from \\"Life Is Now\\". His band consists of Jai Es (drums), Khalid Superstar (lead guitars), Russ Tyler (bass), Xino Siu (guitar), Ivo Antanasov (keyboards), Kelly Ingrim (backup vocals). The Album \\"Life Is Now\\" was officially released worldwide on July 12, 2011. The \\"Life Is Now\\" official album release concert was performed to a sold-out crowd on July 15, 2011 at the Foundry, Long Island City, New York.

This edition was heavily revised and rewritten by Cyril Pocknee. The Parson's Handbook is a book by Percy Dearmer, first published in 1899, that was fundamental to the development of liturgy in the Church of England and throughout the Anglican Communion. The 19th-century Oxford Movement brought the high church within the Church of England into a place of confident leadership of the mainstream of the church. By the end of that century, many were struggling to find suitable forms of worship that were at once obedient to the letter of the Book of Common Prayer (if not its intention) and reflected the desire to a return to more Catholic forms of ritual and ceremonial. Some in the church took on board much of the ritual of the Tridentine Mass. Dearmer and other members of the Alcuin Club decried this wholesale adaptation of Italianate forms, and they campaigned for a revived English Catholicism that was rooted in pre-Reformation ritual, especially in the Sarum Use – something they termed the Anglican Use or English Use. The Parson's Handbook is Dearmer's brotherly advice to fellow churchmen about the correct way to conduct proper and fitting English worship. Dearmer's writing style is strong: he disparages customs he finds quaint or misguided, and makes good use of his subtle wit. Although Deamer's directions would have originally been considered high church, the popularity of the handbook has made them normative. This norm has been influential throughout those portions of the Anglican Communion that have been open to the development of a more Catholic ritual. Although the handbook now appears somewhat dated, and many Anglican provinces have adopted more modern liturgies than the single Book of Common Prayer of Dearmer's age, his work remains surprisingly useful in the modern context. The handbook was first published by Grant Richards in 1899. Oxford University Press published their first edition in 1907. The twelfth edition was published in 1932, four years before Dearmer's death.

He was also a member of the United States national team at the 1971 Pan American Games and 1972 Summer Olympics. ==Early life== Messing was born in The Bronx, New York, grew up in Roslyn, New York, and is Jewish. His mother, the daughter of a Russian furniture maker and his Latvian wife, taught physical education at Nassau Community College, his father was a lawyer who worked in Manhattan, and his paternal grandfather was from Riga, Latvia. Messing, along with his brother Roy, attended high school at The Wheatley School in Old Westbury, New York. ==Playing career== High school and college Messing attended Wheatley High School, where he started playing soccer. He began his collegiate soccer career at New York University where he played soccer, and then Nassau Community College. He graduated from Harvard University in 1972 after playing on the school's men's soccer team. He was a two-time second team All-American. National and Olympic teams He joined the U.S. national team that played in the 1971 Pan American Games in Cali, Colombia. He went on to play with the U.S. team at 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich. The U.S. went 0-2-1 in group play and failed to qualify for the second round. Messing manned the net in the U.S.'s third game of the games, a 7-0 loss to West Germany. The Munich Massacre took place 30 yards from his room. Messing was protected along with 12 other Jewish members of the US Olympic delegation. He said: \\"It really forged a greater Jewish identity for myself at that moment than I ever had before... That was a turning point in my life as an athlete – and as a Jew. Words really can’t describe it.... two German soldiers there with machine guys, saying come with them.... We have to get the athletes to safety. Then I realized that they were rounding up the Jewish athletes.\\" After the Olympics, Messing received offers from teams in Mexico and Germany, but was invited to play for the New York Cosmos of the North American Soccer League (NASL), where his teammates would eventually include Pelé, Franz Beckenbauer and Giorgio Chinaglia. NASL He made his debut with the Cosmos in a May 20, 1974 exhibition game with Irish club Finn Harps. Messing attracted attention by posing in the nude for a photo spread in the December 1974 issue of Viva magazine, for which he was paid $5,000 ($ in current dollar terms). He joked that these photos gave the New York Cosmos more \\"exposure\\" than they'd ever received from the media up to that time. The Cosmos management was not pleased, and cut Messing from the team on the grounds that he had violated a morals clause in his contract. He moved to the Boston Minutemen for a season and a half and led the league in goalkeeping with a 1.24 GAA. Halfway through the 1976 season, Boston owner John Sterge began selling his players when he began to fear he would go bankrupt. The Minutemen sold Messing to the Cosmos who needed him after starter Bob Rigby was injured. Messing then played the 1977 season with the Cosmos before moving to the Oakland Stompers. When he signed with the Stompers for $100,000 ($ in current dollar terms) per year, he became the highest paid American in the NASL. The Stompers lasted only a single season, following which Messing moved to the Rochester Lancers. MISL When the Major Indoor Soccer League began its first season in 1978-1979, the New York Arrows were essentially the Rochester Lancers in different uniforms. As such, Messing became the starting Arrows goalkeeper through the team's six years of existence. Messing became the league's dominant keeper, being named to the MISL All Star team in 1979, 1980 and 1981. He was the championship MVP in 1979. When the Arrows fired coach Don Popovic in February 1983, the team named Messing, who was sidelined with an injury, as the interim coach. After his retirement, Messing was briefly part-owner of the ill-fated New York Express, which played the first half of the 1986-1987 MISL season before folding. ==Awards and honors== Club ;New York Cosmos *Soccer Bowl (1): 1977 ;New York Arrows *Major Indoor Soccer League Championship (4): 1978–79, 1979–80, 1981–82, 1982–83,  Individual  *Major Indoor Soccer League Championship MVP (1): 1978–79 * First Team All MISL (2): 1978–79, 1979–80 * New York Sports Hall of Fame * National Jewish Sports Hall of Fame * Nassau County Sports Hall of Fame ==Broadcaster== Messing has been a soccer broadcaster for sixteen years. He began as an analyst for the Major Indoor Soccer League games on ESPN. He broadcast the 1986 FIFA World Cup from Mexico, the 2002 FIFA World Cup from South Korea/Japan and the 2006 FIFA World Cup in Germany for ESPN. He has also been the main analyst for the MetroStars and the re-branded New York Red Bulls of Major League Soccer, working both on radio and television since 2001. He served as a color commentator for ESPN Radio covering the 2014 FIFA World Cup. Despite his role as a broadcaster/analyst for MLS and other soccer matches, he is the player agent for U.S. under-20 and former D.C. United midfielder Danny Szetela. This has led to some, including Washington Post soccer reporter Steven Goff, to question his objectivity in his work as an analyst. He is a member of the New York Sports Hall of Fame and the National Jewish Sports Hall of Fame, and the author of a book on soccer, while appearing in several films on the sport. In 2006, he was inducted into the Nassau County Sports Hall of Fame. Messing has been the color analyst for Madison Square Garden for twelve years broadcasting the New York Red Bulls games in Major League Soccer. He has also been the color analyst for the 2002, 2006 and 2010 FIFA World Cups for ESPN. Messing served as an analyst for NBC Sports coverage of Soccer at the 2008 and 2012 Summer Olympics.Medium Well: Your NBC Olympics lineup - A blog on sports media, news and networks - baltimoresun.com Currently, Messing is a color commentator for soccer on the MSG Network and ONE World Sports. ==Autobiography== Messing wrote an autobiography entitled The Education of an American Soccer Player which was published in hardcover in 1978 by Dodd, Mead and in paperback in 1979 by Bantam Books. ==Other Media Appearances== Messing appeared as a centerfold in a 1974 issue of Viva magazine.. ==See also== *List of select Jewish football (association; soccer) players ==References== * Color Commentary ==External links== * Michael Lewis: Shep Messing and the 1972 Olympic soccer adventure that turned into tragedy, The Guardian, 6 October 2015. *Noah Davis: \\"Everyone Loves Shep Messing\\" February 26, 2013, SB Nation * Jewish Sports Hall of Fame listing Category:1949 births Category:Living people Category:American people of Latvian-Jewish descent Category:American soccer coaches Category:American soccer players Category:Association football commentators Category:Boston Minutemen players Category:Association football goalkeepers Category:Footballers at the 1971 Pan American Games Category:Footballers at the 1972 Summer Olympics Category:Harvard Crimson men's soccer players Category:NYU Violets athletes Category:Jewish American sportspeople Category:Major Indoor Soccer League (1978–1992) coaches Category:Major Indoor Soccer League (1978–1992) players Category:Nassau Community College alumni Category:New York Arrows players Category:New York Cosmos players Category:New York Cosmos (MISL) players Category:New York Express players Category:North American Soccer League (1968–1984) coaches Category:North American Soccer League (1968–1984) players Category:North American Soccer League (1968–1984) indoor players Category:Oakland Stompers players Category:Olympic soccer players of the United States Category:Sportspeople from the Bronx Category:Pan American Games competitors for the United States Category:Pittsburgh Spirit players Category:Rochester Lancers (1967–1980) players Category:Soccer players from New York (state) Category:People from Old Westbury, New York Category:People from Roslyn, New York Category:Major Indoor Soccer League (1978–1992) commentators ","title":"Shep Messing"},{"id":"5561556","text":"Charles Louis de Fourcroy (1766–1824Paulo Nogueira Santiago (ed.) Ollada sobre a Galiza de 1807 de Charles-Louis de Fourcroy (1770-1824), Toxosoutos (Colección Anais), 2008.) was a French mathematician, scholar and director of fortifications, known from his 1782 treatise, entitled \\"Essai d’une table poléométrique\\"Friendly, Michael, and Daniel J. Denis. \\"Milestones in the history of thematic cartography, statistical graphics, and data visualization.\\" Seeing Science: Today American Association for the Advancement of Science (2008). ==Biography== De Fourcroy was born in the French countryside. He is the author of Essai d'une table poléométrique, a treatise on engineering and civil construction, published in 1782, which is remarkable for its period in its use of graphs to list the achievements of civil engineers of bridges and roads from 1740 to 1780 and its cross-sectional and mathematical analysis of the growth of urban areas. He was awarded the title Chevalier de la Légion d'honneur by Napoleon and the Arch Chancellor of France, the Prince in 1810, while Consul in Cologne. He was also awarded a crest with three argent crescents upon a blue background, intersected by a golden peak above the symbol of the Légion d'honneur on a gules background. The Harrow School Archives have the grant of arms to the Chevalier, Charles de Fourcroy, signed by Napoleon. == Work ==  Essai d’une table poléométrique, 1782  In 1782 De Fourcroy published his \\"Essai d'une Table Poléométrique, ou amusement d'un Amateur de Plans fur les grandeurs de quelques Villes; Avec une carte, ou Tableau qui offre la comparaison de ces Villes par un même échelle.\\" This book gives an analysis of the urban growth of European cities, which are graphically compared in a diagram, called Table Poléométrique or Poleometric Table. Tableau Poléometrique, 1782 In his work De Fourcroy (1782) explained: :\\"If we have the surfaces (i.e., areas) of all the cities/villages in the table, or the proportions representing these cities, transformed into cross-sections, each of equal extension, and each on the same scale; then if we successively put one on the other, from the largest to the smallest, and joined all by one of their angles; these squares would overlap relative to their size, and the whole would form a kind of table that visually represents an idea of the actual proportion that can be found between the surfaces of these different cities. We could as well find in this table two cities of equal size, cut their squares diagonally, and have the table represent only half of each; which essentially means the same. Such is the attached figure, which requires no further explanation.\\"De Fourcroy (1782), cited in: Gilles Palsky (1996): Des Chiffres et des Cartes, p.51-52; Translated by Daniel J. Denis. \\"Des Cartes Generates Aux Cartes Spectates\\" at euclid.psych.yorku.ca, April 7, 2002. A 1782 review of this work by Élie Catherine Fréron mentioned, that the Table Poléométrique explained in the work is plausible for at least 230 cities, foreign and domestic.Élie Catherine Fréron (1782) L'année littéraire ou Suite des lettres sur quelques écrits de ce temps, Vol. 5-6. p. 71 More recently Jacques Bertin in his Semiology of Graphics (1983) further explained the work, which was first published anonymously. In the French National library the work is still listed by its publisher.See also: worldcat.org, and google books accessed 14.01.2015. Bertin wrote :\\"The 'Poleometric Table' (see figure), published in 1782 by Dupain-Triel, is one of the oldest proportional representations of human phenomena which is currently known. François de Dainville has demonstrated... that the author was Charles de Fourcroy, a Director of Fortification. :[in the diagram] each city is represented by a square whose area is proportional to the geographic area occupied by the city (and for the smallest cities, by a half square only, divided by the diagonal line. :When superimposed, the squares are classed automatically. This results in visual groupings which lead the author to propose an 'urban classification.' This example allows us to appreciate the evolution of graphic representation and the efficiency of more recent solutions, based on the standard construction.\\"Jacques Bertin. Semiology of Graphics, 1983. p. 203 De Fourcroy's map is similar to the comparison diagram the German economist and statistician August Friedrich Wilhelm Crome published in 1785, entitled \\"Groessen Karte von Europa.\\" This map made a comparison of European states, instead of a comparison of cities in the Poleometric Table. Palsky (1996) concluded, that \\"the Table established by Fourcroy signals a fundamental moment in the evolution of the graphical method. We see the passage to the abstract, to fictitious features. By these proportional triangles, the author constructs an image that does not return/relate to its original existence.\\"Gilles Palsky (1996): Des Chiffres et des Cartes, p.51-52; Translated by Daniel J.

St. Joseph High School is accredited by the North Central Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools and approved by the Illinois State Board of Education. St. Joe's is a member of the National Catholic Educational Association and the Christian Brothers Educational Association. The school is also a member of the Illinois High School Association (IHSA) and the [Chicago Catholic League] (CCL). ==Admission== Students come from more than 100 elementary schools from the western suburbs and the City of Chicago. The students are accepted for admission based on the entrance exam, grade school records, and teachers’ recommendations for freshman year. Transfer students are accepted based on their academic records, discipline reports, and recommendations. ==History== Samuel Stritch, Cardinal Archbishop of Chicago, invited the Christian Brothers to start a new high school in Westchester, Illinois. Though classes began at the new school in September 1960, work on the building continued through early 1961. The school was dedicated on September 16, 1961 by Cardinal Stritch's successor, Cardinal Albert Gregory Meyer.History of St. Joseph The school earned national attention in the 1994 documentary film Hoop Dreams. The subjects of the film, William Gates and Arthur Agee, were both students at the school, and both played on the basketball team under head coach Gene Pingatore. In 2004, the school became the first Catholic high school in the state of Illinois to enter an all wireless, all laptop learning campus. Every student and teacher receives an IBM/Lenovo laptop computer which they either purchase or lease from the school.Financial information, including info on laptop purchase and lease St. Joseph was an all-male institution until 2005, when Francis George, O.M.I., Cardinal Archbishop of Chicago, permitted the school to become coed in light of the closing of Immaculate Heart of Mary High School, the neighboring all-female institution.St. Joseph goes coed Prior to the opening of school in 2006, St. Joseph's purchased the former grounds and building of the Immaculate Heart of Mary High School, and started the second semester of the 2006-07 school year by moving classes into the building. The original St. Joseph High School building is now used primarily for athletic facilities.IHM becomes the \\"new\\" St. Joseph Since 2008, enrollment has steadily declined, from a peak of near 800 to, now 237. ==Great Seal== In the center is the crest of the De La Salle Christian Brothers, also known as the Brothers of the Christian Schools, the Catholic congregation who sponsors St. Joseph High School. At the top of the crest is the Latin phrase Signum Fidei, which means \\"Sign of the Faith\\", and is the motto of the Brothers. Below the Brothers’ crest is the broken shield, the family emblem of St. John Baptist De La Salle, the 17th-century French saint who founded the Christian Brothers. Below it hangs the star of Bethlehem, a symbol used by Lasallian schools around the world. On one side of the star of faith is the symbol of the atomic age which depicts the school's dedication to learning and technology. On the other side is the hammer and chisel representing the school's patron saint, St. Joseph the Worker, who was noted for his simple, but hard work as a carpenter and as the foster father of Christ. The entire crest is surrounded by plumes and a knight’s helmet, representing the English tradition of the Village of Westchester. Finally, at the top of the great seal of St. Joseph High School is the school motto, “Vincit Qui Laborat,” which means “He conquers, who labors.” Directly below the school seal is a cross to indicate Roman Catholic Church. ==Academics== There are three academic programs in which students pursue coursework: Honors, College Prep (A), and College Prep (B).General Academic Information Coursework is broken down into three divisions: * Applied Sciences: Mathematics, Science, Computer/Technology, Physical Education * Language Arts: English, Fine Arts, Foreign Language * Social Sciences: Religious Studies, Business, Social Studies The school offers the following AP courses: Calculus,Applied Sciencec course offerings English Literature, Studio Art, Spanish Language,Language Arts course offerings and European HistorySocial Sciences course offerings In addition, students have the opportunity to take certain business courses online through Triton College.Social Science course offerings Every spring, St. Joseph High School hosts ChargerFest and (since 1995) sponsors its US$10,000 Super Raffle, which are the school’s biggest fundraisers. ChargerFest features a buffet, door prizes, additional raffles, games, and music. In December 2005, St. Joseph High School hosted an event entitled “Becoming a True Leader,” which featured prominent leaders of today sharing leadership experiences and advice with the entire St. Joe's student body and visitors. Cardinal George began the program by blessing the St. Joseph community and the school’s past heritage and new initiatives. ==Athletics== St. Joseph is a member of the Chicago Catholic League. The school won the 1998 --99 Illinois High School Association boys' basketball championship. St. Joe's Head Basketball Coach Gene Pingatore and alumnus Isiah Thomas were both members of the first class of the East Suburban Catholic Conference’s Hall of Fame in 2006. The school won the 2014–15 Illinois High School Association boys' basketball championship. 2016-17 St. Joseph Football Team had its best season in school history going 7–3, winning Conference for the first time ever on a varsity level and qualifying for the IHSA State Playoffs for the first time. ==Notable alumni== * Andy Frederick (class of 1973) was an offensive tackle in the National Football League (1977–85) and was a member of the Super Bowl XII champion Dallas Cowboys and the Super Bowl XX champion Chicago Bears.Andy Frederick, @databasefootball.com; accessed 4 October 2008 * William Gates (class of 1991) basketball player; subject of the documentary film Hoop DreamsAthletic Hall of Fame * Steven Harris is a professional actor. * Wood Harris is a professional actor and younger brother of Steve Harris.Chaney, Kathy; Actor Wood Harris returns home; 27 May 2009; Chicago Defender online; accessed 16 June 2009 *Demetri McCamey (class of 2007) was a basketball guard for the Illinois Fighting Illini men's basketball team; he currently plays professionally in Japanhttp://www.stltoday.com/stltoday/sports/stories.nsf/illini/story/87EBAEF35589967E862576C60017DDD1?OpenDocument Durando, Stu; 10 February 2010; \\"Illinois Fighting Illini's Demetri McCamey does it again\\" * Amal McCaskill was a professional basketball player, playing in the NBA (1996–97, 2001–04). *Cameron Meredith (class of 2010) is an American football wide receiver for the New Orleans Saints of the NFL * Isiah Thomas (class of 1979) NBA player, coach, executive, member of the 50 Greatest Players in NBA History team *Evan Turner (class of 2007) is a former All- American, 2010 John Wooden Award winner and National Player of the Year at Ohio State (2007-2010); he currently plays guard/forward for the Portland Trail Blazers *Glynn Watson (class of 2015) is a college basketball player for the University of Nebraska-Lincoln and the younger brother of Demetri McCamey *Pierre Walters, former NFL player for the Kansas City Chiefs and current Mixed Martial Artist ==References== Category:Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Chicago Category:Catholic secondary schools in Illinois Category:Lasallian schools in the United States Category:Educational institutions established in 1960 Category:Private high schools in Cook County, Illinois Category:1960 establishments in Illinois ","title":"St. Joseph High School (Westchester, Illinois)"},{"id":"5561609","text":"The 1972 trail 90 was the last year without factory installed turn signals. A 1968 Honda CT90 A 1976 Honda CT90 The Honda CT90 was a small step-through motorcycle manufactured by Honda from 1966 to 1979. It was offered in two models: Trail or X with the main variations being gear ratios and tyre style. ==Predecessors and early models== The CT90 Trail 90 was preceded by the CT200 Trail 90 (1964–1966), which featured a similar design, and was itself preceded by dealer-level modifications to the 49cc Super Cub and the C105T Trail 55. The CT200 had an 87 cc iron-head pushrod OHV engine, instead of the CT90's 89 cc alloy head OHC, with a carburetor to match. Except for the engine change, the 1966 models of CT200 and CT90 were the same—the change in model number reflected a new Honda policy that model numbers would indicate engine-size class. The CT200 and 1966 CT90 had a dual rear sprocket, which created a lower gear range for heavy weight or steep terrain. To shift to the low range, the operator had to stop and clip a short additional section onto the chain, which then would allow it to go around the larger rear sprocket. Starting in August 1967, this cumbersome arrangement was replaced by a two-range sub- transmission, which could be set far more easily by simply moving a small lever while the bike was in neutral and idling. ==1969–1970 Design Updates== While the earlier Honda Trail series had been slightly modified versions of the Super Cub, 1969 and 1970 brought an evolution to the CT90 which tailored it more to the needs of the off-road rider. Now, the Trail 90 was a unique and separate platform, not merely a variation on the city-commuter theme. The greatest change was in 1969, when Honda replaced the Super-Cub-style cantilever-toggle front end with telescoping-tube similar to those found on most motorcycles. This increased travel (and shock absorption) on the front wheel. The large, chrome rear cargo rack which had been an option now became a standard item. No longer being attached to the small, stamped-steel rack inherited from the Super Cub, the new rack had its own dedicated mounting system, which was strong enough to use for lifting the motorcycle. The other obvious change in the 1969 model was the addition of a hard plastic downtube cover, designed specifically for the CT90. Earlier models had retained the Super Cub's air filter box, located on the downtube, and with the removal of the wide shield of the street model, a fabric cover had been used. The new cover would run from the head tube to the bottom of the downtube, providing protection to the carburetor, and the air filter was now located in a plastic box attached to the side of the frame. In 1970, a lever was added to the front end, which made it easy and simple to rotate the handlebars. This feature made it more convenient to store the motorcycle, or to carry it in a rack, truck bed, or even the back of a station wagon. Fold-down handlebars had been introduced on the Honda Z50A Mini Trail in 1968, and had proven popular among owners with space constraints. Though this feature would eventually be dropped from the Mini Trail, the easy-swivel handlebars would be one of the definitive features of the full-size Honda Trail series throughout the rest of production. These were the last major changes made to the \\"Trail 90,\\" and the only other noteworthy change to the Honda Trail bikes came with the change to the 110cc engine in 1980. ==Market== Honda targeted hunters, fishermen, commuters, and outdoorsmen with the Trail 90. Early ads often had these bikes in wilderness settings. They were well suited to narrow trails, being small and lightweight (around 188 pounds) and with a forgiving suspension. The bike was ideal for climbing and carrying packs. The four-stroke engine was quiet and almost all models were equipped with spark-arrestor exhausts. While targeted at off-road users, this was not a dirt bike in the conventional sense. It could be registered for road use, having a top speed in high-ratio road gear of around . Fuel economy was excellent, often around and above 100mpg. In local commuter traffic, it was extremely maneuverable, although it was poorly suited for highway travel because of limited power, off-road-biased tyres, and top speed. Trail 90s were also modified, by aftermarket vendor Suitcase Cycle, for quick breakdown and compact transport via general aviation aircraft. ==Design== The CT90 in its classic form was an 89 cc 4-stroke air- cooled single with a four-speed transmission and a semi-automatic clutch, coupled with a 1.867:1 ratio reduction box that was manually switched into operation using a small lever under the transmission case. The cylinder was nearly horizontal in the step-through tube/stamping frame. The fork was originally a leading link suspension, replaced in 1969 with conventional telescoping-tube suspension. ==Successor== The CT90 ended production in 1979, replaced the following year by the CT110. The CT110 was the same machine but bored out to 105 cc and weighs slightly more. The 1980 CT110 lacked the reduction box; however, it returned in following years. The 2020 Honda CT125 Hunter Cub is a spiritual successor.https://www.autoblog.com/2020/03/27/honda- hunter-cub-ct125-trail-motorbike-motorcycle == Modern day availability and interest == With online sources of used and compatible new parts, and a growing number of social media groups on sites like Facebook offering a wealth of knowledge and advice, more and more CT90s are being dragged out of barns and garages and brought back to life. As a true testament to Honda's original design, that often turns out to be less work than anticipated and these able bikes can be seen more and more around town and on the trail. A quick look on most craiglist regions show a selection of various years and conditions ranging from barn finds to fully restored bikes looking like they just rolled off the factory floor. The 90cc engine offers enough power to be safe around town even in modern traffic, and the low range configuration allows it to handle the same trails as modern bikes and ATVs, albeit at a more moderate pace. ==See also== *Honda CT series bikes: Trail Cub/Hunter Cub ==Notes== CT90 Category:Motorcycles introduced in 1966 ","title":"Honda CT90"},{"id":"5561622","text":"St. Michael Island is an island on the southeast side of the Norton Sound in Alaska.

Such headshunts are typically installed at a terminal station to allow the locomotive of an arriving train to move to the opposite end of (in railway parlance, 'run around') its train, so that it can then haul the same train out of the station in the other direction (assuming, of course, that it is a locomotive equipped to run in either direction; for older, one-way equipment such as steam locomotives and cab unit locomotives, a wye or turntable needs to be provided to physically turn the engine around, as well as a run-around track). ==Reversing headshunt== Melbourne University tram stop has three reversing headshunts in succession, between the two running lines. Found primarily on metro systems, rapid transit light rail networks, and tramways, a 'reversing headshunt' allows certain trains or trams to change direction, even on lines with high traffic flow, whilst others continue through the station. Typically there will be two running lines, one for each direction of travel, and the headshunt will be positioned between the two running lines, linked to both by points. Although most trains will pass through the station and continue in the same direction, an individual train may be directed into the reversing headshunt, before exiting onto the other running line, in the opposite direction of travel. This procedure allows a greater frequency of trains on a city-centre section of the line, and reduced frequency on the suburban sections, by allowing certain trains to shuttle back and forth only on the city centre part, using the reversing headshunts to change direction within the flow of trains. ==Shunting neck== The term headshunt may also refer to shunting neck or 'shunt spur': a short length of track laid parallel to the main line for the purpose of allowing a train to shunt back into a siding or rail yard without occupying the main running-line. ==Run round== Diagram of a headshunt and run round loop A run round loop (or run-around loop) is a track arrangement that enables a locomotive to attach to the opposite end of the train. It is commonly used to haul wagons onto a siding, or at a terminal station to prepare for a return journey. This process is known as \\"running round a train\\". Although a common procedure for passenger trains when the majority of them were locomotive-hauled, the maneuver is now becoming rarer on public service railways. Increased use of multiple unit and push-pull passenger services avoids the requirement for dedicated track and the need for railway staff to detach and reattach the locomotive at track level. However, on heritage railways run-round loops are still usually more or less necessary at each end of the running line, partly because train services are usually locomotive-hauled, and partly because the run-round operation gives added interest to visitors. This practice is still very common on Intercity services in Victoria, Australia.  Examples  Stations which used to have run- rounds include: * UK ** St Ives railway station ** Matlock Riverside railway station, now closed * Australia ** Murwillumbah railway station, now closed ** Toronto railway station, New South Wales, now closed ** Cronulla railway station, had run-round, but never had locomotives ** Newcastle railway station, New South Wales, now closed; run-round on Platform 1&2, not on Platform 3&4 Stations which still have run-rounds include: * UK ** Weymouth railway station ** Fort William railway station ** Morecambe railway station ** Rowsley South railway station ** Mallaig railway station * Germany ** Hagen Hauptbahnhof * Australia (all in regular loco-hauled passenger use unless otherwise indicated) ** Central railway station, Sydney ** Albury railway station ** Canberra railway station (run-around not in regular use) ** Southern Cross railway station (Melbourne) ** Shepparton railway station ** Bairnsdale railway station ** Geelong railway station ** South Geelong railway station ** Marshall railway station ** Warrnambool railway station ** Swan Hill railway station ** Seymour railway station ** Roma Street railway station (Brisbane) (not sure if run-around in use) ** Toowoomba railway station ** Charleville railway station ** Rockhampton railway station ** Longreach railway station ** Townsville railway station ** Mount Isa railway station ** Cairns railway station ** Kuranda railway station ** Adelaide Parklands Terminal ** Public Transport Centre (East Perth terminal) ** Darwin railway station == No loop == If a terminal station has or no longer has a run-round loop, trains are restricted to multiple units or Top and Tail trains. == Relay engines == Sometimes a terminal station has no run-round loops, the absence of which is overcome by coupling a relay engine to the rear to power the next out bound trip. The original engine of the arriving train shunts to the relay engine siding where it awaits the arrival of the second train, and so on. Examples in steam days include Fenchurch Street and Kingsgrove. == References == Category:Railway sidings ","title":"Headshunt"},{"id":"5561639","text":"Campus Corner is a college-oriented commercial district in Norman, Oklahoma located directly north of the University of Oklahoma campus. The area is bounded by White Street, University Boulevard, Boyd Street, and Asp Avenue. The district is home to four blocks of unique retail shopping and mixed-use development, including restaurants, bars, clothing stores, OU memorabilia, personal care, and other businesses and professional organizations. Established in 1917, the area around Boyd Street and Asp Avenue has long been a focal for OU pep rallies and other displays of school spirit. ==History== Campus Corner near Boyd and Asp, circa 1920 Campus Corner was developed during the early 1900s to serve the needs of the faculty and students working at and living nearby the University of Oklahoma. Nearly all student housing was located in the Campus Corner area and at the time students were not permitted to drive. This caused the area to grow rapidly, becoming a thriving business district by 1920. Restaurants, clothing stores, laundry facilities, pharmacies, and beauty salons soon opened for business. One of the early developers in Campus Corner was the Whistler Family, responsible for additions to the area such as the 575 University building which ultimately housed a bookstore, supply shop, restaurant, and a dance floor. In 1929 a tragic fire destroyed most of the then-existing Campus Corner; however, within a few years the area was rebuilt and the fire ultimately led to further expansion. Throughout the 1930s the area continued to grow with the addition of new restaurants, cleaners, and a department store. In 1947 the Boomer Theater was constructed at 765 Asp Avenue. Originally a movie theater, in its later years the Boomer Theater became a concert venue before finally being remodeled for use as a department store/office space during the 1980s. Boomer Theater in Campus Corner During the 1950s enrollment at the university was swelling and as a result Campus Corner was booming. Because of the close proximity between merchants and students, a unique relationship was formed. Many activities were held in Campus Corner. Some of those included RUF/NEKS (a university pep squad) ceremonies, the public shaving of beards to signal the end of Engineers Week, tobacco spitting contests, and numerous bonfires celebrating football games. By the early 1960s enrollment was growing greater than the university's ability to house its students and as a result the decision was made to build new housing on the south end of campus. With the new residence towers completed in the mid-1960s, the popularity of Campus Corner waned. More students were living further from campus as dorms and Greek houses changed locations and more students began to drive. In the 1970s retailers began to build malls and strip centers further west of campus with better access to Norman's primary highway, Interstate 35. What must never be forgotten is that Campus Corner was a beacon of diversity and a cauldron of creativity in the 80's and 90's. Kids and young adults of all walks of life congregated in the area to gather at the myriad stores, restaurants, and bars, all of which were independently owned and privately run. The majority of these are gone now, being forced out by corporate interests. Due to the diversity of cultures, and the changes in the political, social, and even musical landscape of the times, Campus Corner became a bastion of alternative lifestyles and American subcultures. Where acceptance for being different was rare in Oklahoma, it seemed that anyone was welcome on Campus Corner. Punks, Goths, Gays, Emos, Nerds, Geeks, and Club Kids all found a home there when no one else cared. This in turn gave birth to the Norman music scene of the time. Chainsaw Kittens, Flaming Lips, The Buttmen, Ancient Chinese Penis, Gash Wagon, Hinder, The Nixons, The Deathro Bodeans, Defenestration, Blemish, The Starlight Mints, The Mimsies, and Klipspringer are all bands from the era with ties to Norman, and Campus Corner specifically. Local kids and aspiring musicians would grab a slice at Bob's Hole in the Wall, so named for the hole in the wall of the pizza shop that led into Shock Therapy, a local pool hall. People regularly frequented Shadowplay, the areas strongest independent record store where many musicians worked. The Deli, which is one of the only businesses to survive the corporate takeover of Campus Corner has been showcasing local and live talent for decades. The Quarterhouse, a combination bar/grill/pool hall/arcade, was a hub of activity in the 90's after Bob's and Shock Therapy closed down. Also amongst the businesses that fostered this generation was Tina's Guitars, Cafe Expresso, Vito's Pizza, Town Tavern, The Sunshine Store, New York Pizza, Othello's, The Lovelight, Toto's, and Liberty D's. Very few of which remain today. With nowhere to go, and no place to play, the vivid scene on Campus Corner gave way to mainstream businesses and clientele. Local resident, W.B. Humphrey was quoted as saying, \\"That was when the heart and soul of Campus Corner was sold to the devil for a few McRestaurants and iPubs in the name of \\"civic improvements\\". As a result of civic improvements and private funding, the area began to re-emerge as a shopping and social destination in the early-2000s. In recent years the city has improved the infrastructure in the area including new utility lines, lights, security systems, landscaping, parking meters with one-hour limits, curbs, sidewalks, and traffic controls. Campus Corner property owners have also consolidated their properties and organized with one another to deal with long-standing challenges in the area. Owners and tenants have renovated the century-old buildings, having demolished interior walls, re-wired, and re-plumbed much of the area to meet modern city codes. In 2003, head OU football coach Bob Stoops became part owner of a new sports bar in Campus Corner that started a wave of new restaurant openings. Since that time many new businesses have been established in the area, its growth continuing into the 2010s. Harold's In 1935 high school student Harold Powell began working for McCall's department store in Campus Corner; several years later, in 1948, McCall's left the area and Powell opened his own store at the same location. Called Harold's, the department store initially focused on traditional clothing for the many college students in the area. In the 1970s Harold's expanded with new locations in Oklahoma City, Tulsa, and Memphis, Tennessee. Throughout the 1970s and 1980s Harold's went on to become a successful regional chain of traditional, high-end men's and women's clothing stores with its headquarters in Dallas. The Campus Corner location remained open until 2008 when the chain filed for bankruptcy, liquidating all of its assets and closing all store locations. ==Campus Corner today== Campus Corner near Boyd and Asp Today, Campus Corner is home to many businesses including bars, restaurants, banks, computer/technology retail, coffee shops, a newspaper, hair salons, gift shops, accessories boutiques, churches, professional organizations, a bridal shop, and several professional offices. ==References External links == *Campus Corner *City of Norman Category:University of Oklahoma Category:Geography of Cleveland County, Oklahoma Category:Entertainment districts in the United States Category:Buildings and structures in Norman, Oklahoma ","title":"Campus Corner"},{"id":"5561646","text":"Francisco Javier de Lizana y Beaumont (1750 in Arnedo, La Rioja, Spain – March 6, 1815 in Mexico City) was bishop of Mexico and, from July 19, 1809 to May 8, 1810, viceroy of New Spain. ==Ecclesiastical career== Lizana did his religious studies at Calatayud and Zaragoza, where in 1771 he received his doctorate in canon and civil law. In 1772 he was teaching at the University of Alcalá de Henares. In 1795 he was designated bishop in partibus of Taumasia, and in 1801, bishop of Teruel. In 1802 he was named archbishop of Mexico, where he arrived in January 1803. His ecclesiastical administration was characterized by works of social welfare, which he pursued with diligence and honor. He expanded and furnished the Hospital of San Lázaro and endowed the Hospicio de Pobres (poorhouse) and the Casa de Niños Expósitos (foundling home). In the University he founded the chair of ecclesiastical discipline. ==Political career== He was among those who asked Marshal Pedro de Garibay to assume the position of viceroy after the coup that deposed José de Iturrigaray. Garibay did so, but when the Junta de Aranjuez became aware of his advanced age and the fact that he was a puppet of the rich merchants and the Real Audiencia, they named Archbishop Lizana to replace him on an interim basis (February 1809). The archbishop was chosen because the Junta was aware that Catholics did not support Napoleon after the imprisonment of Pope Pius VII in 1809. Lizana named his cousin, Inquisitor Juan Sáenz de Alfaro, to handle his ecclesiastical duties so that Lizana himself could concentrate on his political duties. Sáenz de Alfaro was not a popular choice. He formed new units of provincial militia, and imported arms from Britain. He confiscated the property in New Spain of the Marqués de Branciforte and the Duque de Terranova, nobles in Spain who had declared for King Joseph I (Joseph Bonaparte). He obtained a loan of 3 million pesos in gold on the property. From this and other sources, Lizana was able to remit 9 million pesos to Spain. As a personal contribution to the war effort in Spain, he accepted no salary. Like Garibay, he encountered opposition from the pro-independence party. New Spain had been transformed by the events in the mother country. Anonymous political tracts and clandestine lampoons circulated. Political juntas were formed to seek independence. The Audiencia came in for much criticism for its coup against Iturrigaray. This was felt to be the final closure of the legal route for political change. The only way remaining was direct action. The viceroy was informed of these events, but took no action against them. For this reason the Spaniards in the Audiencia accused him of being a partisan of the Criollos. A pro-independence conspiracy was discovered in Vallodalid (Morelia, Michoacán). This was headed by Lieutenant José Mariano Michelena and Father Vicente de Santa María. They were arrested, and Lizana ordered them brought to Mexico City so that he could speak to them. The conspirators proposed to the viceroy (as related by Michelena) to form a junta to govern New Spain in the name of King Ferdinand VII and to take all possible measures to extend the reign of this \\"august\\" sovereign. Lizana found no criminal offense in the conspirators, and ordered them set free, to the great disgust of the pro-Spanish party. ==After leaving the viceroyalty== Because of this and other failings, and also in consideration of his advanced age, the regency in Aranjuez removed the archbishop from the viceroyalty. They ordered the Real Audiencia to fill in until the arrival of the next viceroy, Francisco Javier Venegas. Lizana continued as archbishop. He was awarded the Cross of Carlos III. He died on March 6, 1815 in Mexico City. ==References== * \\"Lizana y Beaumont, Francisco Javier,\\" Enciclopedia de México, v. 8.

Ronnie Williams began his career as an actor, but struggled for recognition, making an isolated television appearance in The Wednesday Play in 1966 as a newsreader, which by then he was; the episode, \\"Where the Buffalo Roam\\", was written by Dennis Potter and starred Hywel Bennett. He worked as a bus conductor before finding fame with his appearances on Welsh language television, working as a continuity announcer and newsreader for BBC Wales. In 1970, he created a double act with Ryan Davies; their comedy series, Ryan & Ronnie, was broadcast first on BBC Wales and later, in English, on BBC1. Broadcaster Hywel Gwynfryn, in his 2014 biography of the two comedians, describes the contrast between their appearance and character, enhanced by the fact that Williams was a baritone who could hold his own in duets with Davies's tenor. For a while, Gwynfryn lodged with Williams and his wife Einir, who lived in Rhiwbina, Cardiff. One of the scriptwriters on Ryan and Ronnie, Meic Povey, later wrote a play about their career.

(1992). Film Noir: An Encyclopedic Reference to the American Style (3rd ed.). Woodstock, New York: The Overlook Press. crime thriller film written and directed by Walter Hill. It stars Ryan O'Neal, Bruce Dern and Isabelle Adjani. O'Neal stars as The Driver, a getaway driver for robberies, whose exceptional talent has prevented him from being caught. After another escape from the police, a detective (Dern) tries to catch the driver by promising pardons to a gang if they help to convict him in a set-up robbery. The Driver seeks help from The Player to mislead the detective. 20th Century Fox released The Driver on July 28, 1978. The film was a box office disappointment in the United States but performed better overseas. It initially received negative reviews but has become one of Hill's most popular films. Film directors like Quentin Tarantino, Nicolas Winding Refn and Edgar Wright have cited The Driver as a major influence on their films. ==Plot== The Driver is a quiet, enigmatic man who steals cars to use as getaway vehicles in robberies around Los Angeles. He is known among fellow criminals for his high price, commensurate with his skill. He has also gained notoriety among police, particularly the volatile Detective, who has become obsessed with capturing The Driver, who he refers to as \\"Cowboy\\". The Driver pulls a job at a casino, but his co-conspirators are late to reach him, causing him to be seen by several bystanders, including The Player. She is brought in by The Detective to identify him, but is paid off to deny seeing him. The Driver meets The Player at her apartment to pay her, but they are interrupted by The Detective, who threatens her and alludes to her criminal history. Frustrated at failing to capture The Driver, The Detective sets up an illegal sting. He offers two captured criminals – Glasses and Teeth – a deal: pull a bank heist, hire The Driver, and deliver him to the police. In return, they will not be arrested for either crime. The two seek out The Driver via The Connection, his middleman and fence. The Driver initially refuses to work with the men due to his dislike of guns, but agrees to meet with them. When his driving prowess is questioned, he systematically wrecks the criminals' car, then fights with Teeth, defeating him. Unable to convince The Driver to pull the job, The Detective confronts The Driver at his rented room, taunting him and challenging him to a 'game' between them. The Driver agrees to take part in the job on the condition that his fee is doubled, and that Teeth does not take part. During the heist, Glasses kills his partner and successfully escapes with The Driver. However, Glasses does not bring him to The Detective – instead, he plans to kill The Driver and make off with the money. The Driver surprises him with a gun, killing him and taking the money. The Driver stashes the money in a locker at Union Station. He meets with The Connection, who agrees to launder the dirty money. He then meets with The Player, enlisting her to help with retrieving the clean money. Meanwhile, Teeth, who has discovered Glasses dead, interrogates The Connection at gunpoint, killing her once she reveals The Driver's plans. The Player heads to the train station, meeting with the Exchange Man. He stashes the clean money in an empty locker, then boards a train with the dirty money. Unbeknownst to them, the station is being watched by the police. The Exchange Man is followed on board by The Detective, who kills him in a shootout. Meanwhile, Teeth confronts The Player, stealing her purse containing the key to the locker containing the clean money. Teeth and his driver are chased by The Driver and The Player. The chase culminates in a warehouse, where The Driver drives directly at Teeth's car, causing them to swerve out of the way and flip the car. The Driver tells Teeth to surrender, killing him when he refuses. Teeth's driver returns the purse and is allowed to leave. The Driver returns to the train station with The Player and retrieves the bag from the locker. He is met by The Detective and several police officers waiting to arrest him, but reveals that the bag is empty, having been ripped off by the Exchange Man. Upon seeing the empty bag, The Player leaves. The Driver leaves The Detective literally 'holding the bag', and each man departs from the station. ==Cast== *Ryan O'Neal as The Driver *Bruce Dern as The Detective *Isabelle Adjani as The Player *Ronee Blakley as The Connection *Matt Clark as Red Plainclothesman *Felice Orlandi as Gold Plainclothesman * Joseph Walsh as Glasses * Rudy Ramos as Teeth * Denny Macko as Exchange Man * Frank Bruno as The Kid * Will Walker as Fingers * Sandy Brown Wyeth as Split * Tara King as Frizzy * Richard Carey as Floorman * Fidel Corona as Card Player * Victor Gilmour as Boardman *Nick Dimitri as Blue Mask *Bob Minor as Green Mask ==Production== The Driver writer-director Walter Hill, pictured in 2014 Development The Driver is the second film Walter Hill wrote and directed after Hard Times (1975), which starred Charles Bronson. Hill and producer Larry Gordon had just finished Hard Times when Gordon suggested to Hill that they make a film about a getaway driver, to which Hill agreed. Hill then wrote an original screenplay over the summer of 1975, in between the period when Hard Times was made and when it was released (there was a delay because the studio was waiting for other Bronson films to come out). Hill says he was interested to see how \\"pure\\" a film he could make: a genre film that did not conform itself in conventional, Hollywood ways. He said he wrote it as a \\"very tight script.\\" \\"I knew when I was getting ready to do the movie that I was taking a chance\\", said Hill. \\"This was not meant to be an everyday action movie. I was trying to do something a little more, or a little less, but I was trying to do something else.\\" The script was written in a sparse, minimalist style, which Hill had first employed on Hard Times: \\"I thought that approach made people read with greater intention. It's spare in detail but written to dramatic effect. You could maybe capture the mind of the reader a little better.\\" Hill sent a copy of the original draft of the script to Raoul Walsh, who gave it his approval. Pre-production In the late 1970s, Britain's EMI Films came under the stewardship of Michael Deeley and Barry Spikings. They began co-financing movies shot in Hollywood in association with major US studios that were aimed at the international market, such as Convoy, The Deer Hunter and The Driver. They were interested in financing The Driver provided a suitable star could be found for the lead. According to Hill, the script was unable to bring in talents for \\"about a year and a half.\\" The role of the Driver was originally intended for Steve McQueen, who had starred in the Hill-scripted The Getaway (1972). McQueen turned down the role because, as Hill stated, he refused to star in another film that revolved substantially around cars. The studio then went to Bronson, but he was unhappy with Hill. \\"He thought I had edited Hard Times in a way that had not favoured [Bronson's wife and co-star] Jill Ireland\\", said Hill, who added he \\"never thought\\" casting Bronson \\"was a good idea. And I never thought he'd do it.\\" Hill was contacted by Ryan O'Neal's agent and agreed to meet the star. \\"We talked about the role and talked about the minimalist approach I wanted to try\\", said Hill. \\"He felt he could do it and we just got comfortable with each other.\\" Although considered primarily a comedy and romantic star at the time, O'Neal's casting enabled the filmmakers to secure financing. O'Neal complimented the filmmaker as \\"a force to be reckoned with\\", as well as \\"a first rate writer and an even better director. And he's fast. Most young directors today think they are David Lean; they spend over a year on a film and we get robots that talk.\\" Several actors were considered for the female lead, including Julie Christie and Charlotte Rampling. Eventually, it went to Isabelle Adjani, who had gained an international reputation with The Story of Adele H (1975). This was Adjani's first Hollywood role; she had previously turned down the chance to star in The Other Side of Midnight (1977), but agreed to make The Driver because she was an admirer of Hard Times. Of Hill, Adjani commented: > I think he is wonderful, very much in the tradition of Howard Hawks, lean > and spare. The story is contemporary but also very stylized, and the roles > that Ryan and I play are like Bogart and Bacall. We are both gamblers in our > souls and we do not show our emotions or say a lot. For us, talk is cheap. I > am really quite a mysterious girl in this film, with no name and no > background. And I must say that it is restful not to have a life behind me; > this way, I don't have to dig deep to play the part. All I know is that life > for me is gambling and I am a loser. I have what people call a poker face. The studio recommended Robert Mitchum for the role of the Detective. Hill liked the idea and met with Mitchum to discuss the part but the actor turned it down. Hill ended up casting Bruce Dern. \\"I wanted Bruce's personality\\", he said. \\"Audiences get nervous about movies that don't have a lot of dialogue. [...] They like a balance. I wanted Bruce to very much offset the distance of The Driver.\\" Filming The film featured several car chase sequences. Hill says he felt the first chase was \\"kind of a failure\\" because it \\"was meant to lead up to a much more spectacular finish\\" but he was unable to film it properly: it was done on the last night of shooting and an electrician fell off the roof and was badly injured; Hill could not get all the shots he wanted and had to \\"cobble together\\" the end result. However, he felt the sequence with the Mercedes Benz in the garage and the final chase were \\"as fully realised as I could get them to be.\\" Hill wanted to film chase scenes at night, which he felt had not been done many times in films before. In order to expedite this, Hill shot the dramatic scenes first during the day, then the chase scenes at night. Hill said the night shooting was draining: \\"It's like you're swimming underwater or hypnotised. And I'm a person that stays up late and wakes up early. But staying up night after night after night really threw me out. You make decisions you cannot explain. You just intuit.\\" Hill says the major visual influence on the film was the works of artist Edward Hopper. He was also influenced by his work as a second assistant director on Bullitt (1968), which featured a famous car chase. What fascinated Hill on Bullitt was the abundance of shots captured from inside the cars, which compelled him to film the same amount on The Driver. Production wrapped on the film April 1978. ==Reception== Critical Contemporary reviews were extremely poor. Hill later said, \\"I remember the studio had this huge sheaf of Xeroxed reviews they’d handed me — you could stop a fucking .45 slug with this stack, it was so thick. And of all the reviews in this six-inch thick pile, there was only one good one.\\" Kevin Thomas of the Los Angeles Times called the film \\"ultraviolent trash that wipes out Ryan O'Neal, Bruce Dern and Isabella Adjani... plays like a bad imitation of a French gangster picture which in turn is a bad imitation of an American gangster picture.\\" Vincent Canby of the New York Times wrote \\"It is Awful Movie. It is Pretentious Movie. It is Silly Movie. It talks just like this.\\" Roger Ebert gave The Driver 2.5 stars out of 4, writing: \\"It's a movie about people who are not real because they are symbols, and it's a damned good thing there are great chase scenes or the movie would sink altogether.\\"http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/the-driver-1978 Saying it's \\"probably advisable for film noir aficionados only\\", film critic Duncan Shepherd of the San Diego Reader gave it five out of five stars. \\"The whole show, in fact, is something like a coded message passed from the moviemaker to the devotees of the genre, in full view of, but beyond the full understanding of, the rest of the audience\\", according to Shepherd.Review of The Driver in the Reader. As of September 2018, the film holds an approval rating of 73% on Rotten Tomatoes based on 22 reviews.http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/driver Box office The movie was a commercial disappointment in the United States although it performed better overseas. Hill says \\"I don't think you could say the film did commercially well anywhere except Japan, where I believe it did reasonable business.\\" The film opened in 642 theatres in the United States, grossing $2 million for the weekend. The film grossed a total of 1,102,183 admissions in France. It was the 33rd most popular film of the year. Producer Larry Gordon later reflected on the film's poor critical and box office response in the US: > If we'd had Clint Eastwood in the film, we'd have been forgiven everything > and they'd have said, 'It's another Eastwood film about driving cars'.\\" If > we'd had Steve McQueen, we'd have been compared to Bullitt or The Getaway. > We were treated as an art film rather than an action film. We took a unique > approach to standard material. We'd go the same way again, but with a > different cast we might have attracted an audience. I believe in returning > investors' money – and if I could make The Driver again I'd try to rectify > it for a commercial market. When you're writing this kind of script... > naturally you think of an action lead like Bronson or Eastwood... and > certainly Fox wanted a name. But when we got Ryan, I suggested we make > changes to suit his character. This is always the director's prerogative. Isabelle Adjani later complained she felt the film hurt her career. \\"Afterwards the only American offers I got were bad ones\\", she said. \\"I did it, really because after The Story of Adele H everyone urged me to make a Hollywood film. I turned down several, and felt I couldn't continue to do that. And I liked Walter Hill. Only later did I realize I'd made a terrible mistake.\\" Walter Hill recalled, \\"Had I not been shooting The Warriors at the time, I don't think my career would have survived. They loved it overseas, but in those days, that didn't matter that much. It made exactly zero dollars in the United States. \\"I think Ryan gave a very good performance\\", added Hill. \\"I was always very happy with what he did.\\" He said, \\"I was very disappointed that people didn't particularly give him any credit for what he did. To me, he's the best he's ever been. I cannot imagine another actor. When you don't get who you want, sometimes you really do get lucky.\\" EMI Films had announced plans to make another film with Hill, a Western called The Last Gun, but this did not eventuate. ==Legacy== The film has gone on to become more popular, and it often the first film shown during retrospectives of Hill's work. The Reflections Interactive video game Driver (1999) uses several unmistakable thematic inspirations from this movie. Both Quentin Tarantino's Pulp Fiction (1994) and Kill Bill: Volume 2 (2004) refer to this film: a shot and setup of Vincent Vega skidding out into the road with an overdosed Mia Wallace in the passenger seat in Pulp Fiction is copied from the opening chase of The Driver; and Beatrix Kiddo being described as \\"the cowgirl [who] ain't never been caught\\" in Kill Bill: Volume 2 is copied from Ryan O'Neal's character description in The Driver as \\"the cowboy who could not be caught\\". According to Wensley Clarkson's book, Tarantino – The Man, the Myths and His Movies, Tarantino lists The Driver as one of the \\"coolest movies of all time.\\"Tarantino – The Man, the Myths and His Movies by Wensley Clarkson. John Blake, Publisher, 2007. The film also influenced Drive (2011), directed by Nicolas Winding Refn. \\"It's a very different movie\\", said Hill of this. \\"It has certain things, as Nic has told me, that are homage and that's fine. It's very complimentary. I bear him no animosity or anything. I think he's a remarkably talented guy and quite like him.\\" Baby Driver (2017), directed by Edgar Wright, was also influenced by The Driver. Wright commented on Hill's film: \\"Its influence on video games is very clear and in movies its style has echoed throughout the work of Michael Mann, James Cameron, Quentin Tarantino, Nicolas Refn and now me with my new film (ahem), Baby Driver.\\" ==See also== *Drive *Baby Driver ==ReferencesExternal links== * * *Copy of screenplay plus analysis at Cinephilia Beyond Category:1978 films Category:1970s action thriller films Category:1970s crime thriller films Category:20th Century Fox films Category:American films Category:American action thriller films Category:American crime drama films Category:American crime thriller films Category:American heist films Category:American chase films Category:English- language films Category:Films about automobiles Category:Films directed by Walter Hill Category:Films set in Los Angeles Category:Films shot in Los Angeles Category:American neo-noir films Category:American road movies Category:1970s road movies Category:Films scored by Michael Small Category:Films with screenplays by Walter Hill Category:EMI Films films ","title":"The Driver"},{"id":"5561798","text":"The Central Professional Hockey League was a minor professional ice hockey league that operated in the United States from 1963 to 1984. Named the Central Hockey League for the 1968–69 season and forward, it was owned and operated by the National Hockey League and served as a successor to the Eastern Professional Hockey League, which had folded after the 1962–63 season. Four of the CHL's initial franchises were, in fact, relocations of the previous year's EPHL teams, while the fifth came from the International Hockey League. Its founding president was Jack Adams, who served in the role until his death in 1968. The CHL's championship trophy was called the Adams Cup in his honor. ==History== In the league's first season, all five teams were affiliated with an NHL club. The CHL initially consisted of the Indianapolis Capitals (Detroit Red Wings), Minneapolis Bruins (Boston Bruins), Omaha Knights (Montreal Canadiens), St. Louis Braves (Chicago Black Hawks) and the St. Paul Rangers (New York Rangers). The only NHL team without a CHL affiliate that year, the Toronto Maple Leafs, joined the league through its affiliation with the Tulsa Oilers in the CHL's second season. After Adams's death, Emory Jones served as interim president until the appointment of lawyer Joe Kane in August 1968. Kane announced the league was changing its name on September 26, 1968, dropping Professional from the title. He served one year as president, retiring in June 1969. Kane was succeeded by Jones, who held the job until retiring in 1974. Max McNab served as league president from 1974 until becoming general manager of the Washington Capitals during his second season. Ray Miron was hired as president in August 1976, but resigned less than three weeks later to accept the job as general manager of the Colorado Rockies. Before the end of the month, Bud Poile became league president and would hold the job until the CHL folded in 1984. For the 1974–75 season, the CHL absorbed three teams, the Denver Spurs, Salt Lake Golden Eagles, and Seattle Totems, from the folding Western Hockey League. Salt Lake would stay in the league until the end and would continue in the International Hockey League for the 1984–85 season, after the CHL ceased operations. Denver and Seattle were admitted to the CHL as a stepping stone for their eventual admission to the NHL in 1976; however, the league never followed through on the expansion, and both teams folded after 1975. For 1979–80, the CHL added the Cincinnati Stingers and Birmingham Bulls, the two teams from the World Hockey Association that were not admitted to the NHL that year. Also during the 1979–80 season, the United States Olympic hockey team played games against each team in the CHL that counted in the standings. The team went on to win the gold medal at the 1980 Winter Olympics. In the 1983–84 season, both the U.S. and Canadian Olympic hockey teams played games in the CHL. The CHL's final champions, the Tulsa Oilers, were left without a home during their championship 1983–84 season when the team owners went into receivership. The league stepped in to keep the team operating, and the Oilers played all their games on the road from mid-February through the end of the playoffs. Their Cup-winning game on April 27, 1984 was the last game played in the CHL. The league folded the following month. ==TeamsAdams Cup champions== ‡ Oilers team was left without a home after its owners in Tulsa went into receivership; played the last two months of the season and all playoff games as a road team, with salaries and expenses paid by the league. ==Annual awards== *Adams Cup – Awarded to the CHL Championship team *Tommy Ivan Trophy – Most Valuable Player *Phil Esposito Trophy – Leading Scorer during the Regular Season *Bobby Orr Trophy – Most Valuable Defenseman *Bob Gassoff Trophy – Most Improved Defenseman *Terry Sawchuk Trophy – Top Goaltender(s) on the Best Defensive Team (lowest GAA) *Ken McKenzie Trophy – Rookie of the Year *Don Ashby Memorial Trophy – Iron Man Award *Max McNab Trophy – Most Valuable Player in the Adams Cup playoffs *Jake Milford Trophy – Coach of the Year *Clarence Campbell Trophy – CHL franchise that best exemplifies professionalism in hockey ==ReferencesExternal links== *C.H.L.

It is a tributary of the Hampton River, a tidal inlet of the Atlantic Ocean. Approximately two miles of the Taylor River are tidal. The river rises on the border between Hampton Falls and Kensington, New Hampshire. It follows a winding course north, then east, then southeast through the rolling lowlands of Hampton Falls, reaching tidewater at a dam and fish ladder where Interstate 95 crosses the river. For the lower four miles of the river, it forms the boundary between Hampton Falls and Hampton, New Hampshire. The freshwater portion of the river is an active recreation area for summer fishing, kayaking and canoeing. Ice fishing and cross country skiing are also pastimes here. The dam was built in the 1950s in order to construct Interstate 95 and is owned by the New Hampshire Department of Transportation. ==History== The Taylor River was named for Anthony Taylor, one of the founders of Hampton, New Hampshire. Born in England between 1607 and 1611, he arrived in America, with his wife Phillipa, on the Anne and Elizabeth in 1635. Thereafter a lifelong resident of Hampton, he “became a valuable and leading man” by virtue of his heavy involvement with local government. Taylor was a feltmaker but was also a tavern keeper, constable, and performed many other functions in the Hampton area. Anthony Taylor died in Hampton on November 4, 1687, at the age of 80. He was preceded in death by his Phillipa who also died in Hampton on September 20, 1683. Anthony and Phillipa are thought to be the oldest known Taylors in America and have descendants spread across the North and South American continents.Family History of Anthony Taylor and Some of His Descendants 1635 - 1935. ==See also== *List of rivers of New Hampshire ==References== Category:Rivers of New Hampshire Category:Rivers of Rockingham County, New Hampshire ","title":"Taylor River (New Hampshire)"},{"id":"5561813","text":"Siarhiej Alehavič Kaścicyn (; born 20 March 1987), better known as Sergei Kostitsyn (), is a Belarusian professional ice hockey winger who is currently an unrestricted free agent. He most recently played for Dinamo Minsk of the Kontinental Hockey League (KHL). He has previously played with the Montreal Canadiens and the Nashville Predators of the National Hockey League (NHL) alongside his older brother Andrei. ==Playing career== Junior hockey Like his older brother, Sergei excelled in the Belarusian junior hockey program. Sergei played for HK Gomel in Belarus in 2004–05 (14 points in 40 games) and was drafted in the Canadian Hockey League (CHL) Import Draft by the Ontario Hockey League (OHL)'s London Knights. Sergei was also drafted in the seventh round, 200th overall in the 2005 NHL Entry Draft by the Montreal Canadiens, the team that also had drafted Andrei in the first round (10th overall) in the 2003 NHL Entry Draft. He was traded to the Nashville Predators on 29 June 2010. Kostitsyn moved to North America in 2005–06 to play with the Knights and recorded 26 goals, 52 assists and 78 points, leading all OHL rookies in scoring during the 2005–06 season. The 19-year-old was the second runner-up for the Emms Family Award, as OHL Rookie of the Year, behind Logan Couture of the Ottawa 67's and 15-year-old winner John Tavares of the Oshawa Generals. Sergei was instrumental in the London Knights' 2006 playoff run, which saw them lose to the Peterborough Petes in the OHL final. In his first ever OHL playoff game against the Sault Ste. Marie Greyhounds, Sergei had six points, a goal and five assists, in a 6–1 London win. In the semi-finals, Kostitsyn scored the series-clinching goal against the Guelph Storm, a power play goal in the first overtime of game five. In addition to being named team rookie of the year, the Knights named him the playoff performer of the year, finishing the post-season with 37 points in 19 games. Joining the Canadiens' 2006–07 training camp, Kostitsyn was returned to London for a second OHL season. He was placed on a line with young superstars Patrick Kane and Sam Gagner and was named an alternate captain. Kostitsyn finished third in OHL and CHL scoring behind teammate Patrick Kane and Oshawa's John Tavares, tallying 40 goals and 131 points in only 59 games. His 91 assists led the CHL and broke the London Knights franchise record of 89 set in 1972–73 by Dennis Ververgaert. Montreal Canadiens On 2 May 2007, Sergei Kostitsyn signed an amateur tryout contract with the Canadiens' AHL team, the Hamilton Bulldogs. However, after not being inserted in the lineup, he returned home to see his family. On 25 May, Kostitsyn signed with the Canadiens to a 3-year, entry-level contract. Kostitsyn began the 2007–08 season with the Bulldogs. On 13 December 2007, while leading the Bulldogs in scoring, Kostitsyn was called up by the Canadiens. He played his first career NHL game against the Philadelphia Flyers on 13 December and played on the top-line with captain Saku Koivu and Chris Higgins. Sergei recorded his first career NHL point, an assist, in the next game, a 4–1 win against the Toronto Maple Leafs on 15 December. Five days later, in his fourth game on 20 December, Sergei scored his first career NHL goal, a power play marker in a 5–2 win against the Washington Capitals. He finished his rookie season with 27 points in 51 games and added eight points in 12 playoff games. The following season, Kostitsyn was reassigned to Hamilton on 19 February 2009. He was called back up a little over a month later on 22 March. Prior to the 2009–10 season, Kostitsyn was cut from the lineup and assigned to Hamilton. On 30 September, he announced that he would not report to Hamilton and even asked to be traded. He was then suspended by the team. A few days later, Kostitsyn agreed to report to the Bulldogs in time for the start of the 2009–10 season. After four points in the first five games of the season, however, he left the team on 21 October and was consequently suspended a second time by the Canadiens. He finally decided to report once again to the Hamilton Bulldogs and after recording 13 points in 16 games with the Bulldogs, he was recalled by the Canadiens.http://www.rds.ca/canadien/chroniques/284647.html On 7 May, Sergei was effectively cut from the Canadiens when Jacques Martin told the player to stay off the ice for the morning practice. Nashville Predators On 29 June 2010, Kostitsyn was sent to the Nashville Predators for goaltender Dan Ellis and forward Dustin Boyd in a trade involving future considerations. On 6 July, Kostitsyn signed a one-year deal with the Predators worth $550,000 that ran through the 2010–11 season. In the 2011–12 season, his second with the Predators, Kostitsyn scored his first career hat-trick on 1 January 2012. On 4 July 2013, Kostitsyn was placed on waivers for the condition of a mutual termination of his contract with the Predators. On 6 July 2013, he signed a three-year contract to return to Avangard Omsk of the Kontinental Hockey League (KHL), his club during the 2012 NHL lockout. KHL In June 2014, Avangard Omsk traded Kostitsyn to Ak Bars Kazan in exchange for Konstantin Barulin. In the 2015–16 season, he played for Torpedo Nizhny Novgorod before joining Dinamo Minsk for the 2016–17 season and then returned to Torpedo for the 2017–18 season. On 3 May 2018, Kostitsyn signed a two-year contract as a free agent to return to his native Belarus, for a second stint with Dinamo Minsk of the KHL. ==International play== As a junior, Kostitsyn has participated in four World Under-17 tournaments, three World Junior Under-18 Championships, and two World Junior Championships, one of which was with his brother Andrei. In the 2006 World Junior Championships, he was named best forward in Division I B, leading Belarus to a promotion to the top-tier. Playing in pool A in 2007, he scored a goal and two assists in the first game of the tournament, a 4–2 upset victory against Finland. He finished the tournament with 5 points in 6 games. After his rookie season with the Canadiens, Kostitsyn competed in the 2008 IIHF World Championship with Belarus. He played in four games, recording one assist.

In 1916/17 he studied drawing and painting with the well known Swiss painter Janet in Colombier, Switzerland. He continued his education as an artist at the school of arts in Basle, Switzerland. His parents decided that he should become a business man in order to take over his father's wine business which he did in 1929. This job, however, did not satisfy him and, after marrying in 1936 he and his wife decided to embark on a full-time artistic career. He now also engaged in his hobby, archaeology and he became well known for his discoveries and descriptions of Germanic, Roman, Celtic and Neolithic stations in Northwestern Switzerland. For his merits he became a member of the commission of antiquities of the Canton of Baselland. During World War II he was a soldier in the Swiss army and was ordered by his superiors to record with pencil and paint brush special historical events. Thus, fascinating and historically valuable sketches and paintings of wartime events along the Swiss border were generated. Paintings of the Red Cross organized transfer of French children to neutral Switzerland, of the arrival of French and American troops at the Swiss border and sketches of the erroneous bombardment of Basle in 1945 are especially singled out. From 1945 to 1972 - interrupted by various voyages to France, Italy, Spain and Holland - Fritz Pümpin has painted in his beloved Jura area of Northwestern Switzerland. His main subjects were landscapes and villages. He has succeeded in over fifty years of work to capture his homeland with convincing strokes of his paintbrush in his post-impressionist style. Portraits, \\"nature morts\\", drawings and paintings from his voyages abroad, from his military service and from his archaeological excavations enrich his work. == Literature ==  Painter  * Suter,P., Jenne,M., Frey M., \\"Fritz Pümpin\\".

April 15, 2008. Accessed June 11, 2011 who was sentenced to a 130-year prison sentence without the possibility of parole in Montana after being convicted of kidnapping, aggravated assault, and sexual assault of various children.Great Falls Tribune, \\"Judge to hear testimony on Bar-Jonah's request for new trial,\\" June 13, 2006 He was born in Worcester, Massachusetts. ==Early life== In late July 1964, seven-year-old Bar-Jonah lured a five-year-old neighbor into his basement, telling her that he had received a Ouija board for his birthday that could predict the future. Once in his basement, Bar-Jonah attempted to strangle the girl, but her screams attracted the attention of his mother, who came to her rescue.Espy, John C.: Eat the Evidence: A Journey Through The Dark Boroughs Of A Paedophilic Cannibal's Mind. Karnac Books, 2014 In January 1970, at the age of twelve, Bar-Jonah managed to lure another neighbor, a six-year-old boy, to a nearby hill, claiming he wanted to go \\"sledding\\" with him. Once they arrived, however, Bar-Jonah sexually assaulted the boy. A few years later, Bar-Jonah attempted to lure two boys riding their bicycles down his street to a nearby cemetery, where he intended to murder them, but one of the boys grew suspicious and persuaded his friend not to go. ==Crimes== In late March 1975, Bar-Jonah, impersonating a police officer, abducted eight-year-old Richard O'Conner while he was on his way to school, then proceeded to sexually assault and strangle him. A neighbor, looking out of her window, observed the abduction and notified authorities, who began searching for the boy. A patrol car later observed a car matching that used in the abduction parked far away from others in a parking lot, and after calling for backup, ordered Bar-Jonah out of the car. O'Conner was found in the car bloodied, having defecated and urinated on himself from the sexual assault, and near the point of death. A few days before his high school graduation, Bar-Jonah drove to nearby Hartford, Connecticut, and, again impersonating a police officer, abducted a nine-year-old girl, whom he savagely assaulted in the car. After the child began vomiting and convulsing from the assault, he drove up to a sidewalk and threw the girl out of the car. A nearby witness saw the incident and got Bar- Jonah's license plate, leading to his arrest. This assault never got back to Bar-Jonah's probation officer, and he was released from parole in May 1976 for his earlier abduction and sexual assault of O'Conner. When Bar-Jonah's probationary period was over, he received a letter thanking him for his \\"cooperation.\\" On September 24, 1977, Bar-Jonah, claiming to be an undercover FBI agent, convinced two boys coming out of the White City Cinemas in Shrewsbury, Massachusetts to enter his vehicle. Bar-Jonah then transported the boys to a secluded area, where he handcuffed then proceeded to strangle and flick cigarette ashes upon them. After jumping repeatedly on the chest of one of the boys, the Bar-Jonah believed he had killed him, then drove off with the other still alive in his trunk. However, the first boy regained consciousness and managed to find help, leading shortly thereafter to Bar-Jonah's arrest; the other boy was found, still alive, in his trunk. For this crime, he was convicted of attempted murder and received the maximum sentence of eighteen to twenty years in prison. While in prison he was transferred to the Bridgewater State Hospital. On March 22, 1984, he changed his name to Nathaniel Benjamin Levi Bar-Jonah. He gave several reasons for changing his name: he told friends and relatives that he wanted to know what it was like to be discriminated against and persecuted as a Jew.\\"Cannibalism and the Strange Case of Nathaniel Bar-Jonah\\", TruTV. Accessed June 11, 2011 During a later interview with Dr. Michael Stone for the television show Most Evil, he claimed he was Jewish and wanted his name to reflect that. Later in the same year, Superior Court Judge Walter E. Steele ruled that Massachusetts had failed to prove that Bar-Jonah was dangerous and he was released before moving to Great Falls, Montana. During this time, Bar-Jonah confided in his psychiatrists that he fantasized about abducting, murdering, and cannibalizing children. On August 9, 1991, just a month after being released from Bridgewater State Hospital, Bar-Jonah observed a seven-year-old boy sitting alone in a car outside of a post office in Oxford, Massachusetts. Bar-Jonah, who weighed at the time, entered the vehicle and sat on the boy, thrusting his mass atop the boy's fragile chest. Some witnesses, along with the boy's mother, observed the event and ran to the boy's rescue, causing Bar-Jonah to flee. An officer recognized Bar-Jonah's description from over fifteen years earlier, and he was later arrested for the attack. At first, Bar-Jonah claimed that he entered the car to get out of the rain, but later admitted that he intended to kill the boy. For the attack, Bar-Jonah was sentenced to probation in Montana. Disappearance of Zach Ramsay On February 6, 1996, 10-year old Zach Ramsay left his apartment at around 7:34 a.m. to attend school, taking his usual school route through an alleyway near the 400 block of 4th Street N. Ramsay was wearing a blue denim jacket with green sleeves, a blue football jersey with his last name imprinted on the back in gold letters, stonewashed jeans, and black high-top sneakers. A family of three who lived in an apartment in the alleyway reported seeing Ramsay there that morning, and also reported seeing an off-white, four-door car nearly run him over. Another witness reported seeing Ramsay standing in the alleyway and that he appeared to be \\"waiting for someone.\\" Yet another witness, who lived near the end of the alleyway, reported seeing Ramsay distressed with an obese adult male following him a few feet behind at about 7:45 a.m. A witness reported seeing Bar-Jonah standing beside a dumpster in the alleyway at 7:15 a.m. while taking out the trash; he was wearing a navy- blue \\"police-like\\" jacket. The same witness also reported seeing Ramsay enter the alleyway later and that Bar-Jonah was still standing beside the dumpster. Somewhere between where the alleyway cuts into 6th Street and comes out at 7th, Ramsay disappeared; he has never been seen or heard from since. Despite the objections of Ramsay's mother, a judge declared him legally dead in 2011. Police investigations conducted years after Ramsay went missing determined that Bar-Jonah had access to his mother's off-white, four-door 1978 Toyota Corolla the day the boy disappeared, and that his mother and brother were out of town for a funeral. It was moreover determined that Bar-Jonah did not work on February 6 of 1996, nor on the days immediately preceding. While searching Bar-Jonah's apartment, detectives found a list of boys' names which included previous victims and a \\"Zackery Ramsey,\\" followed by the word \\"DIED.\\" Furthermore, dozens of newspaper clippings were found in Bar-Jonah's apartment following the Ramsay case. A former roommate of Bar-Jonah described finding clothes in his apartment which appeared to match those Ramsay was wearing the day he disappeared, in addition to bloody gloves. Another roommate and others claimed that Bar-Jonah sometimes spontaneously brought up the boy in conversations. Investigators also found notebooks with seemingly arbitrary characters which were believed to be coded writing. With the help of the FBI, and after months of effort, the writing was decoded; in the notebooks, Bar- Jonah described torturing and eating children; there were also macabre recipes involving children's body parts. When detectives sprayed Bar-Jonah's garage with a phosphorus chemical while investigating his involvement in the Ramsay disappearance, the word \\"Tita\\" appeared, which led authorities to believe that Bar-Jonah may have been responsible for the abduction of James Teta, a Massachusetts boy who was kidnapped on August 23, 1973. Teta's body was discovered on August 25, 1973 in Rindge, New Hampshire, off of Route 119; an autopsy revealed that he had been raped and strangled. ==Arrest, trial and imprisonment== Bar-Jonah was arrested again in 1999, initially for impersonating a police officer. After searching his home and finding, among other things, many pictures of young children cut out of magazines and a bone that was identified as belonging to an unknown young male, Montana police charged Bar-Jonah with kidnapping and sexual assault,Most Evil on Discovery ChannelDiscovery Channel Most Evil as well as the kidnapping and sexual assault of three other boys. Bar-Jonah was prosecuted for the abduction and molestation of three boys and convicted of kidnapping, aggravated assault, and sexual assault, including charges that he had tortured one of the boys and hung him from the ceiling. During Bar-Jonah's trial, 36-year-old Mary Patrone recognized him as the man who had abducted and assaulted her by dressing as a police officer in 1974. However, the statute of limitations had expired, and Bar-Jonah could not be charged with the crime. Investigators also suspected Bar-Jonah in the disappearance of seven-year-old Janice Pockett 10 months earlier.http://articles.courant.com/2001-01-21/news/0101212027_1_abducted- montana-officials-nathaniel-bar-jonah Bar-Jonah was sentenced to 130 years in prison. He maintained his innocence up until his death.New York Times, \\"Charges Dropped In Child Killing,\\" October 3, 2002 Montana authorities were unaware of Bar-Jonah's criminal record in Massachusetts, a fact that was cited by activists campaigning to force former sex offenders to register. In December 2004, the Montana Supreme Court turned down Bar-Jonah's appeals and upheld the conviction and 130-year prison sentence. ==Death== Bar-Jonah was found unresponsive in his prison cell on the morning of April 13, 2008. He had been in poor health. His post mortem found significant levels of LDL in his arteries and myocardial infarction was the determined cause of death. ==Allegations of cannibalism== Bar-Jonah's earliest interest in the taste of human flesh can be traced to his childhood. Beginning at about the age of six, he would pick at his scabs until his skin was festering, then proceed to suck on the blood from the wound. His teachers at Webster Elementary School would call his mother numerous times to notify her that her son's habit was upsetting to the teachers and students. When he was incarcerated in Montana State Prison, many of the guards observed him perform the same habit. One guard reported that once Bar-Jonah had the scab in his mouth that he \\"appeared to be having sex.\\" While incarcerated at Bridgewater State Hospital, Bar-Jonah confided in his psychiatrists about his murderous and cannibalistic ideations. One of his therapists noted, \\"Brown's sexual fantasies, bizarre in nature, outline methods of torture [and] extend… to dissection and cannibalism\\" and again \\"express a curiosity about the taste of human flesh.\\"http://truecrimecases.blogspot.com/2012/08/annibalism-and-strange-case- of.html Although Bar-Jonah was known to be a voracious eater who weighed in excess of , financial records indicated that he had not made any significant grocery store purchases for nearly a month after Ramsay disappeared. However, he could have also paid for any groceries using cash or have been well-stocked on food and meat. After Ramsay's disappearance, Bar-Jonah also began to hold cookouts in which he was reported to serve burgers, spaghetti, chili, meat pies, casseroles, and the like to guests. At many of these cookouts, a number of persons told Bar-Jonah that the meat had a peculiar taste to it; Bar- Jonah's response was that he had gone deer hunting and used deer meat in the dishes. However, Bar-Jonah did not own a rifle or a hunting license, nor had he been deer hunting at any time. To one woman, who told Bar-Jonah that she found the taste of his meat to be repulsive, he replied that he had personally \\"hunted, killed, butchered and wrapped the meat\\" of the deer. He would later be accused of molesting this woman's son. In Bar-Jonah's apartment, detectives also found a number of recipes using children's body parts with contemptuous titles such as \\"little boy pot pie,\\" \\"french fried kid,\\" and phrases such as \\"lunch is served on the patio with roasted child.\\" In the decoded journals, Bar-Jonah also referenced serving these recipes to neighbors. Also, hair was found inside a meat grinder in his apartment; when the hair was tested for DNA, it was found to belong to an African-American male, but did not belong to Ramsay. The DNA of the hair was also different from the child bone fragments found in Bar-Jonah's garage, which also did not belong to Ramsay. ==Other possible victims== On the morning of October 13, 1997, fourteen year old Amanda Gallion left her home on bicycle en route to school at approximately 7:15 a.m., disappearing along the way. Gallion was often mistaken for a boy in her Gillette, Wyoming, neighborhood. Bar-Jonah arrived in Gillette on the night of October 12, 1997, where he stayed at a small motel on the outskirts of town, and was back in his Montana residence by the following night. Gallion's bicycle was subsequently discovered along the side of the road off I-90. Gallion's social security number has not been used since her disappearance. ==References== Category:1957 births Category:2008 deaths Category:American people who died in prison custody Category:American cannibals Category:American kidnappers Category:American rapists Category:American sex offenders Category:American people convicted of attempted murder Category:American people convicted of child sexual abuse Category:People from Worcester, Massachusetts Category:Prisoners and detainees of Massachusetts Category:Prisoners who died in Montana detention Category:20th-century American criminals Category:American male criminals Category:American serial killers ","title":"Nathaniel Bar-Jonah"},{"id":"5561860","text":"Power Hockey is a competitive, fast-paced hockey game based on the use of a power wheelchair. The foundation of the sport derives from ice hockey and floor hockey, but with adapted rules to enable people with disabilities, who use a power wheelchair, to play and be active in a competitive team setting. The sport is also referred to as Electric Wheelchair Hockey or Electric Wheelchair Floorball in various parts of the world. ==History of power hockey== In the 1970s, some public schools began providing sports lessons for pupils with disabilities. The majority of the children had physical disabilities that greatly hindered their movement (muscular dystrophy, cerebral palsy) and were not capable of participating in mainstream sports. This type of sport was great for adaptation because it could be played by solely utilizing the maneuverability of the wheelchair, and not focus on gross motor movement and muscle power. There are similarities with floorball. Power Hockey is also referred to as “Electric Wheelchair Hockey”, and the name has some history behind it. With its great similarity to ice hockey, it was initially just called “Wheelchair Hockey”, but later in order indicate the use of an electric wheelchair, the word “electric” was added. Power Hockey (Electric Wheelchair Hockey) began to receive public interest in the late 1980s, when tournaments were established in Germany and Netherlands. However, it wasn’t until the 1990s that power hockey began to receive international attention. In 1998, the first ever World Games for Power Hockey were held in Utrecht, Netherlands. In 2001, a big international Power Hockey tournament took place in Minneapolis. In the following years, World Championships, European Championships, and more tournaments were formed in other European countries such as Belgium, Finland, and Italy (“History”). ==Positions== The number of players on a specific team can change, but at any given time there are five players on the floor. There is usually one head coach and one assistant coach to direct the movements of the team members. * One center * One goaltender * Two winger positions (left and right) * One defenceman position ==Rule changes== * A basketball court is used instead of ice. * A plastic ball is used instead of a hockey puck. * The hockey stick that is used is made entirely from plastic. * Players with excessive limited range and movement can play with a T-stick. * Due to the goalies' limited ability to move, they do not freeze the ball. Instead, the official blows the whistle to stop play when the ball is underneath the goaltender's wheelchair, and play restarts with a keeperball. * “Each playoff game will consist of three fifteen minute non-stop time periods. The last two minutes of the third period will be played on a stop-time basis” (“CEWHA Official Tournament Rules and Regulations”). If the score is tied at the end of the game, teams will play for additional five minutes, and whichever team that scores first will win (“CEWHA Official Tournament Rules and Regulations”). == Equipment == * “All players must use a power wheelchair. Manual wheelchairs and electric scooters are not permitted” (“CEWHA Official Tournament Rules and Regulations”). * All players are required to wear their team sweaters that are distinct from the other teams’ at all times (“CEWHA Official Tournament Rules and Regulations”). * All players need to be fully equipped with a protective eyewear and a seat belt (“CEWHA Official Tournament Rules and Regulations”). ==Events World Rankings == Below is the world rankings for power hockey provided by International Wheelchair & Amputee Sports Federation. It has been updated after the EC2016 that was held in De Rijp, Netherlands, and published on the IPCH website on 31 August 2016. 1 Netherlands 2 Italy 3 Germany 4 Belgium 5 Denmark 6 Switzerland 7 Finland 8 Australia 9 Slovenia 10 Spain 11 Czech Republic == Variations of Hockey == There are many variations of hockey besides power hockey. These variations of hockey differ in rules, settings, and materials (Mittal 19-20). * Ball hockey * Box hockey * Broomball * Deck hockey * Floor hockey * Floorball * Foot hockey * Gym hockey * Indoor field hockey * Mini hockey * Nok hockey * Pond hockey * Rossall hockey * Shinny * Skater hockey * Spongee * Table hockey * Underwater hockey * Unicycle hockey  Sponsorships/Partnerships  There are many different corporate partners and corporate sponsors for the Power Hockey League. Opportunities are available for companies and businesses to sponsor the league and support the disabled as they enjoy a sport dear to their heart. Companies have taken these opportunities since the league was first created to have their brand associated with the league. There are currently over a dozen sponsors. ==See also== *Wheelchair Sports, USA *Sledge hockey ==External links== *IPCH - IWAS PowerChair Hockey - *U.S Electric Wheelchair Hockey Association *Toronto Power Wheelchair Hockey League *Canadian Electric Wheelchair Hockey Association *Wheelchair Hockey League (WCHL - Michigan) *Disabled Sports USA *North Carolina Electric Wheelchair Hockey Association *National Sports Center for the Disabled *FIWH *Gruppo Sportivo ViterSport *M-Team Electric Gladiators (Finnish power hockey club) *Manitoba Power Wheelchair Hockey Association *CEWHA Official Tournament Rules and Regulations *IWAS Committee Electric Wheelchair Hockey - History *PowerHockey.com - Leagues *HOCKEY : RULES AND REGULATIONS *World Rankings Category:Variations of ice hockey Category:Variations of hockey Hockey Category:Team sports == References == ","title":"Power hockey"},{"id":"5561861","text":"Official logo of the Olympiad Official mascot of the Olympiad The 33rd Chess Olympiad, organized by FIDE and comprising an openAlthough commonly referred to as the men's division, this section is open to both male and female players. and a women's tournament, took place between September 26 and October 13, 1998, in Elista, Kalmykia, Russia. There were 110 teams in the open event and 72 in the women's event. The Olympiad was the first international chess event to be held at Chess City. Construction of the complex was not complete by the start of the tournament, and some FIDE members were concerned that the facilities would not be ready in time, including the airport, telephone system, player housing, and the \\"Chess Palace\\" to be used as the main playing hall. Reported human rights abuses by FIDE and Kalmykia president Kirsan Ilyumzhinov led to calls for a boycott from Valery Borshchev, a member of the Duma. The British government did not call for a boycott but confirmed \\"reliable reports of human rights problems\\" and suggested that Kalmykian authorities might use publicity from Olympiad participation by foreign teams for its own purposes. Three nations were signed up but chose to stay away: Denmark, Norway, and Slovakia. The opening ceremony took place as scheduled, but the Chess Palace was still covered in scaffolding and was missing many windows. The first round was delayed, one free day was eliminated, and the tournament was shortened to 13 rounds from the planned 14. The organizers worked around the clock and playing conditions improved as the tournament progressed, although the main playing hall was not properly heated. Living conditions, food and drink, and telephone service were generally reported to be acceptable. Both tournament sections were officiated by International Arbiter Geurt Gijssen (Netherlands). Teams were paired across the 13 rounds of competition according to the Swiss system. The open division was played over four boards per round, whilst the women's was played over three. In the event of a draw, the tie-break was decided by 1. the Buchholz system; and 2. match points. The time control for each game permitted each player 100 minutes to make the first 40 of his or her moves, then an additional 50 minutes to make the next 20 moves, and then 10 minutes to finish the game, with an additional 30 seconds devolving on each player after each move, beginning with the first. In addition to the overall medal winners, the teams were divided into seeding groups, with the top finishers in each group receiving special prizes. ==Open event== The open division was contested by 110 teams representing 106 nations. Russia, as hosts, fielded an unprecedented four teams (Russia \\"C\\" was referred to as \\"Team Kalmykia\\" and Russia \\"D\\" was a youth team), whilst the International Braille Chess Association provided one squad. Even without their strongest players, the \\"Three Ks\\" (PCA world champion Garry Kasparov, FIDE champion Anatoly Karpov and Vladimir Kramnik), Russia were still favourites, and the team did win their fourth consecutive title. The United States improved another spot from the previous Olympiad and finished second, and Ukraine took the bronze medals, beating Israel on tiebreak. :{  + Open event ! # !! Country !! Players !!

He attended two local private schools, Northumberland Academy and Rappahannock Academy, before attending Dickinson College in Carlisle, Pennsylvania. He studied law and graduated from the University of Virginia in 1837. Two years later, he was admitted to the bar and established a law practice at Hague, Virginia. Beale was elected as a Democrat to the Thirtieth Congress (March 4, 1847 - March 3, 1849). However, he declined to be a candidate for renomination in 1848. He served as a member of the Virginia constitutional reform convention in 1850-51 where he opposed constitutional reform as a member of the ruling Richmond Junta, and he was elected to the State senate from 1858 to 1860. ==Civil War== Upon the secession of Virginia in 1861, Beale accepted a commission in the cavalry as a lieutenant in the 9th Virginia Cavalry. He was soon promoted to captain and then major, and placed in command of Camp Lee, near his hometown of Hague, on the lower Potomac River. Being commended for his intelligence and excellent judgment, he subsequently served under Col. W. H. F. \\"Rooney\\" Lee in the 9th Virginia Cavalry in what became the Army of Northern Virginia. When Lee was promoted to brigadier general, Beale was advanced to the rank of colonel on September 15, 1862 and given command of the regiment, which included his sons. In December 1862, he led a bold expedition throughout the countryside near the Rappahannock River, capturing the Federal garrison at Leeds without losing a man. Beale's service in 1863 earned him several written commendations and praises. On April 16, he won the praise of Maj. Gen. J.E.B. Stuart for repelling the threatened raid of Maj. Gen. George Stoneman's Federal cavalry division, capturing several prisoners during a week of nearly continual fighting. During the Gettysburg Campaign, Beale led the 9th Virginia in a charge on Fleetwood Hill at the Battle of Brandy Station in June. He participated in Stuart's subsequent ride around the Army of the Potomac and the raid through Maryland and Pennsylvania. He participated in hard fighting at Gettysburg's East Cavalry Field in early July and during the army's retreat to Virginia. He briefly assumed command of Rooney Lee's brigade during fighting at Culpeper Court House and participated in the Bristoe and Mine Run Campaigns. In March 1864, he made a forced march to intercept Union Col. Ulric Dahlgren and his raiders. A detachment of his 9th Virginia Cavalry successfully ambushed the Federals, and, with other units, captured about 175 men and killed Dahlgren. The papers found upon Dahlgren's person, revealing a design to burn Richmond and kill President Jefferson Davis and his Cabinet, were forwarded through Maj. Gen. Fitzhugh Lee to the Confederate government. These controversial papers discovered by Beale's troopers may have been a factor that influenced John Wilkes Booth in his decision to assassinate Abraham Lincoln. Beale led his regiment during the Overland Campaign, and captured two Union flags at the Second Battle of Ream's Station during the Siege of Petersburg. In August, upon the death of John R. Chambliss, Beale was assigned to command of Chambliss's brigade, although still with the rank of colonel. It was not until February 6, 1865, that he was finally promoted to brigadier general. He led the brigade through the end of the war. He was wounded and captured at Appomattox Station on April 9, 1865, and was paroled on April 27 at Ashland. ==Postbellum activities== After the war, Beale resumed his political career during Reconstruction. He was elected to the Forty-fifth Congress to fill the vacancy caused by the death of Beverly B. Douglas. He was reelected and served in the Forty-sixth Congress from January 23, 1879 to March 3, 1881. Finally retiring from public service, Beale resumed the practice of law. He also wrote A History of the Ninth Virginia Cavalry in the War Between the States. Beale died near Hague, Virginia, and was buried there at Hickory Hill Cemetery. ==Elections== *1847; Beale was first elected to the U.S. House of Representatives from Virginia's 8th District with 51.86% of the vote, defeating Whig Willoughby Newton. *1855; Beale lost election to the U.S. House of Representatives from Virginia's 1st District, defeated by Democrat Thomas Henry Bayly. *1878; Beale was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives from Virginia's 1st District with 48.32% of the vote, defeating Republican George C. Round and Independent Democrat John Critcher. *1879; Beale won a special election with 75.84% of the vote, defeating Republican U.W. Douglas and Independents George C. Round and John W. Parker. ==Bibliography== * ==See also== *List of American Civil War generals (Confederate) ==NotesReferences== * Eicher, John H., and David J. Eicher, Civil War High Commands.

The series featured the first-half West Division champion Los Angeles Dodgers and the second-half East Division champion Montreal Expos. The Dodgers won the series three games to two over the Expos, thanks to a ninth-inning home run in Game 5 by Rick Monday in what has ever since been referred to as \\"Blue Monday\\" by Expos fans. The Dodgers would go on to defeat the New York Yankees in the World Series. == Background == Due to the 1981 Major League Baseball strike, a team had to win two postseason series in order to go to the World Series. Teams that finished first in their division in the first and second halves of the season advanced to the postseason. This was the first year the baseball postseason had three rounds, an arrangement that would permanently return beginning with the 1995 season. The Expos advanced to the NLCS after defeating the defending world champion Philadelphia Phillies in the NL Division Series three games to two, and the Dodgers made their way to the NLCS after beating the Houston Astros three games to two in the NLDS. This was also the first NLCS since 1973 that did not feature either the Philadelphia Phillies or their cross-state rival Pittsburgh Pirates, and only the third since the NLCS was first played in . == Summary ==  Montreal Expos vs. Los Angeles Dodgers  == Game summaries ==  Game 1  Tuesday, October 13, 1981, at Dodger Stadium in Los Angeles, California The Dodgers took the first game of the series behind the strong pitching of starter Burt Hooton. For the first seven innings the game stayed close, with the only scoring coming in the second inning when the Dodgers got two runs on an RBI double by Ron Cey and a squeeze bunt by Bill Russell. Hooton and reliever Bob Welch made the 2–0 lead stand up until the eighth when the Dodgers broke the game open with three more runs on back-to-back homers by Pedro Guerrero and Mike Scioscia. The Expos got one run back in the ninth when Larry Parrish doubled home Gary Carter. But reliever Steve Howe came on for the Dodgers and got the final three outs to preserve Los Angeles' victory.  Game 2  Wednesday, October 14, 1981, at Dodger Stadium in Los Angeles, California Montreal's Ray Burris helped even the series with a masterful complete game shutout in Game 2. The Dodgers managed only five singles against Burris, and their only real threats, in the sixth and ninth, were foiled by double plays. Typically in what would be a very low-scoring series, the Expos didn't do much more hitting against Dodger starter Fernando Valenzuela. But Montreal did manage to push across two runs in the second on RBI hits by Warren Cromartie and Tim Raines. Montreal added another run in the sixth, aided by Dusty Baker's error in left. Burris did the rest to notch his 3–0 victory.  Game 3  Friday, October 16, 1981, at Olympic Stadium in Montreal, Quebec Montreal got another superb pitching performance in Game 3, this time from Steve Rogers, to take a 2–1 lead in the series. Rogers allowed only a single run on a Ron Cey groundout after singles by Dusty Baker and Steve Garvey in the fourth. For a while it looked like Dodger starter Jerry Reuss might make that 1–0 score hold up. But Montreal finally rallied for four runs in the sixth on a run-scoring single by Larry Parrish and a three-run homer by Jerry White. Rogers easily preserved the 4–1 lead over the final three innings, and Montreal was now only one victory away from the World Series.  Game 4  Saturday, October 17, 1981, at Olympic Stadium in Montreal, Quebec For the first seven innings Game 4 followed the usual pattern of the series, with dominant performances from both starting pitchers. Montreal's Bill Gullickson allowed an unearned run in the third, after Bill Russell reached on Larry Parrish's error and scored on Dusty Baker's double. Los Angeles' Burt Hooton gave up the game-tying run in the fourth on another unearned tally, when Gary Carter reached on Ron Cey's error and scored on a single by Warren Cromartie. The starters yielded nothing more until the eighth, when Steve Garvey's two-run homer put the Dodgers up 3–1 and chased Gullickson. The Dodgers blew the game open with four more runs in the ninth, highlighted by Baker's two-run single. Hooton finally tired in the eighth but the Dodger bullpen got the last five outs and the series was even.  Game 5  Monday, October 19, 1981, at Olympic Stadium in Montreal, Quebec After a rainout (actually a snow/cold out) on Sunday, October 18, Olympic Stadium was only two-thirds full for Game 5 on a cold and drizzly Monday afternoon, which turned out to be the series' most dramatic contest. As usual in the series, the starting pitchers dominated, with the Dodgers' Fernando Valenzuela and the Expos' Ray Burris. Montreal broke on top with a single run in the first when Tim Raines led off with a double and eventually scored on a double play. The Dodgers tied the game in the fifth after Rick Monday singled, went to third on a Pedro Guerrero single, and scored on a groundout. Burris finally left the game in the eighth when the Expos pinch-hit for him. Montreal brought on their ace Steve Rogers to pitch the ninth, and with two out in the inning, he gave up a homer to Monday on a 3–1 count to put the Dodgers up 2–1. The Expos got a couple of two-out walks in the bottom of the ninth off Valenzuela, but Bob Welch came on to get the final out and send the Dodgers to the World Series. It would be the final postseason game played in Montreal and it would take another 31 seasons until the franchise returned to the postseason again as the Washington Nationals. The date came to be known as \\"Blue Monday\\" by Expos' fans.CBC: 2004NBC: 2004. Monday, October 19, 1981. It was cold, it was damp — and it was the end of the Expos' most successful season. In Montreal, everybody just calls it Blue Monday. Expos' broadcaster Dave Van Horne described the loss as one of the lowest points in team history.Cowan: 2011. \\"Everybody who followed the Expos will remember the National League Championship Series of 1981 when they lost out on Blue Monday to the Los Angeles Dodgers,\\" Van Horne said. \\"That was a low point for all of us because the team had reached an elevated stature within the National League and we were within one game of going to the World Series.\\" ==Composite box== 1981 NLCS (3–2): Los Angeles Dodgers over Montreal Expos ==Aftermath== The Dodgers went on to defeat the New York Yankees four games to two in the 1981 World Series.

However, WKBS was on stronger financial footing than WPHL and WIBF, and quickly established itself as the leading independent in Philadelphia, retaining the top spot for almost a decade.

In addition, WKBS aired shows produced by other Kaiser stations, such as The Lou Gordon Program from WKBD. In a controversial 1972 episode, then-Philadelphia mayor Frank Rizzo, frustrated with Gordon's line of questioning, walked out of the interview.Frank Rizzo appearance on The Lou Gordon Program, 1972. YouTube. Retrieved 2013-03-07. In the mid-1970s, WKBS also aired ABC shows that WPVI- TV (channel 6) preempted in favor of local programming, and during the 1976-77 season, it aired NBC shows preempted by KYW-TV (channel 3). In 1977, Kaiser left the television business and sold its share of the stations, including WKBS-TV, to Field.\\"FCC approves Field purchase, cites benefit to UHF medium.\\" Broadcasting, June 27, 1977, pp. 29-30. For most of the next few years, WKBS waged a spirited battle with WTAF for first place among the city's independents. However, by the early 1980s, WTAF was the entrenched top independent in Philadelphia. News operation WKBS-TV operated a small news department during its early years, producing a newscast at the station's morning sign-on time, and providing news updates during the course of the broadcast day. Among channel 48's first on-air reporters was Jim Vance, who started his television career with WKBS in 1968 before moving to WRC-TV in Washington, D.C., in 1969. In the 1970s, WKBS-TV attempted a 10 p.m. newscast. However, the experiment failed, apparently because the Philadelphia market was not ready for a prime-time newscast. From the late 1970s until the station went dark, channel 48 would air news updates anchored by Pat Farnack. Starting in 1982, the station aired a news simulcast of CNN2 (now HLN) with local news inserts at 10 p.m. on weekdays. Marty Jacobs also hosted a public affairs program. Closure In 1982, a nasty dispute over the operation of Field Communications between brothers Marshall Field V and Frederick W. Field resulted in the liquidation of their company, including their broadcasting interests.It Sounded Like Dallas, Not Chicago, as Two Half Brothers Broke Up the Field Family Empire, by Barbara Kleban Mills and Susan Deutsch. People Magazine, Vol. 20, No. 24, 12 December 1983. Retrieved on 3 August 2014. By June 1983 three of Field's stations had already been sold, leaving the company with its Philadelphia and Detroit outlets. While many larger broadcast groups were interested in the station, none were willing to pay Field's asking price. The Providence Journal Company, owners of WPHL-TV, offered to buy WKBS, sell WPHL's channel 17 broadcast license to a religious broadcaster and merge WPHL and WKBS' stronger programming under WKBS' license and channel allocation. However, Journal's offer was still well below Field's asking price. WKBS employees tried to obtain financing to buy the station themselves, but also could not meet the asking price. Finally, with no acceptable takers for either station and facing a deadline to close down the company, Field announced on July 15, 1983, that it would shut down WKBS-TV at the end of August. Field held onto WKBD in Detroit for a few more weeks before selling it to Cox Enterprises that fall (the sale was finally consummated in February 1984). Most of channel 48's programming (except for shows provided by syndication firm Viacom) and some production equipment were sold to WPHL-TV, while the station's license was returned to the FCC.\\"Field to dismantle its Philadelphia station, WKBS-TV.\\" Broadcasting, July 25, 1983, pg. 89. On August 30, 1983, following the telecast of a college football game, WKBS-TV signed off for the final time. The sign-off sequence, usually a film of The Star-Spangled Banner, was instead replaced by a video of the employees saying farewell accompanied by Simon and Garfunkel's \\"The Sound of Silence\\". The sequence began with an editorial by the station's final general manager, Vincent F. Baressi: ==Epilogue== After channel 48 went off the air, the Philadelphia market was left with two independents. The first station to make a serious attempt to replace WKBS as the market's third indie outlet was WRBV-TV (channel 65, now WUVP), based in Vineland, New Jersey in June 1985. A short time later, WRBV was sold to the broadcasting arm of the Asbury Park Press, which changed its calls to WSJT. This station never nearly matched what had been offered on WKBS, and was also hampered by an inadequate signal which leaned to the southeast. Then, in October 1985, former subscription television outlet WWSG- TV (channel 57, now WPSG) became a full-service independent and changed its calls to WGBS-TV. WSJT briefly attempted to wage a ratings battle with WGBS, but this was over before it even started due to WSJT's aforementioned weak signal. Within a few months, WGBS established itself as the third independent in Philadelphia. Despite financial problems within the station's ownership, WGBS gave WTAF-TV a serious challenge for the top spot among Philadelphia's independent outlets. In January 1984, just months after WKBS left the air, the FCC put a new channel 48 construction permit up for auction. Among those bidding on it were the Baltimore-based Sinclair Broadcast Group; Dorothy Brunson, an African-American radio station owner from Baltimore; and Cornerstone Television, a Christian television network based in the Pittsburgh suburbs.\\"For the record.\\" Broadcasting, January 16, 1984, pg. 147\\"For the record.\\" Broadcasting, January 30, 1984, pg. 101: Burlington 48 Inc., applicant for facilities, was principally owned by Julian Sinclair Smith, founder of Sinclair Broadcast Group. After a two-year process, the auction ended with Brunson winning the permit.\\"Washington Watch: Burlington TV.\\" Broadcasting, February 17, 1986, pp. 62-63. Cornerstone had, during the interim, purchased channel 48's transmitter, moved it to Altoona and used it to sign on a new station in 1985 on channel 47, ironically enough under the WKBS-TV call letters. Brunson signed her station on as WGTW-TV on August 15, 1992. The station carried on as an independent for more than a decade before being sold to the Trinity Broadcasting Network in 2004. The two stations are not related; although WGTW originally shared the same city of license (Burlington; WGTW moved its license to Millville in 2017) and the same channel allocation as the old WKBS-TV, it operates under a separate license. WKBS' license expired on October 4, 1983 and was returned to the FCC, while WGTW's construction permit was issued on July 14, 1988. licensing.fcc.govwww.fcc.gov ==Out of market cable carriage== In its final years, channel 48, along with rivals WPHL and WTAF, was carried on cable systems throughout the New York City market portion of Northern and Central New Jersey, as well as parts of the Baltimore and Harrisburg markets. When the announcement was made that the station was going dark, the systems began to gradually remove the station from their lineups. ==On-air staff== Notable former on-air staff *Marty Jacobs, Mgr News/Public Affairs (1972 to the end) first Nationally run News For Children (Mini-News), award-winning community affairs, became one of the first 12 hosts at the start of QVC. *Pat Farnack - part-time news anchor for 1980 attempt to create 10p newscast, now midday anchor at WCBS radio in New York).

M. Nandakumar and produced by Rajalakshmi Kalaikudam. The film features Prashanth, Meera Chopra and Meghna Naidu in the leading roles, while Vivek, Vijayan and Vijayakumar play other pivotal roles. Featuring music composed by Bharadwaj, the film released in 8 September 2006 to below average reviews. ==Plot== The movie is about Velan (Prashanth), a responsible son of a village landlord (Vijayakumar). Adored by the villagers for his good deeds, Velan gets a shock when the landlord informs him that he is his foster son. A shocked Velan sets out on a mission to learn about his past. He reaches Chennai and comes to know that his family members were killed by a dreaded gangster Deva (Vijayan). He then vowed to kill him and his gang. In the name of Jambhavan, he starts to kill rowdies in society. Suffering a head injury, Velan loses his memory and is later adopted by the landlord. He comes to know that his job was just half-done. The remainder of the movie is how he puts an end to Deva and his men. ==Cast== *Prashanth as Velan *Nila as Ezhil *Meghna Naidu as Anu *Vijayan as Deva *Vijayakumar as Velan's foster father *Vivek as Subhash *Madhan Bob as Doctor *Y.

Directed by Nandakumar who earlier directed Vijayakanth starrer Thennavan (2003), it was reported that actor Prashanth would sport three different appearances in the movie and a special make-up man and physical instructors were brought in from Mumbai for the movie. Nila and Meghna Naidu were signed to portray the film's lead heroines, while Carnatic vocalist T. N. Seshagopalan was also selected to play a pivotal role, in his second film. A third leading female role was considered, but later dropped after actresses had refused the offer. The team then began shoot with a thirty-day schedule in Tenkasi in Southern Tamil Nadu. The making of the film was disrupted in January 2006, when actress Nila walked out of the film after falling out with the producers. It was revealed that for a bathing scene in Courtallam she had asked for the tub to be filled with mineral water and when the team could not satisfy that demand, she had a difference of opinion with the producers. Nila revealed that she was an asthma sufferer and was unable to get into the tub of water that the team had provided. During a press meet in late March 2006, Nila announced that she re-joined the team and shot for scenes in Taramani, Chennai and had put aside her differences after the producers apologised. The team then also went on to film song sequences in Thailand with the lead pair. ==Release== The film opened on 8 September 2006 alongside Krishna's Sillunu Oru Kaadhal and Thirumurugan's Emmtan-Magan, and received predominantly negative reviews. A critic from Sify.com noted \\"this film is a slapdash enterprise that will make you groan\\", adding \\"it caters strictly to B and C class audiences and leaves you cold\\". Another reviewer noted the similarity to Baashha (1995) adding \\"the quality of these remakes has ranged from entertaining to outright bad and Prashanth's Jaambavan unfortunately comes in at the lower end of that scale.\\"http://www.reocities.com/bbreviews/2006/jaambavaan.html Indiaglitz.com also noted the similarity adding \\"director Nandakumar has taken cue from a few 'mass films', but just has not managed to cobble them with any sense of purpose.\\" ==Soundtrack== The film score and the soundtrack were composed by film composer Bharadwaj.

The national broadcaster Vietnam Television (VTV) was established in Hanoi with technical assistance and training from Cuba in September 1970. VTV now is the largest television network in the nation, broadcast in nine FTA channels and available internationally via satellite. VTV also operates the largest cable network (VTVCab) and a DTH satellite service. These carry the nine FTA VTV channels: VTV1, VTV2, VTV3, VTV4, VTV5, VTV6, VTV7, VTV8, VTV9 ; twenty-three Vietnamese subscription channels: VTVCab1 (VIE Giải Trí), VTVCab2 (Phim Việt), VTVCab3 (Thể Thao TV), VTVCab4 (Văn Hoá/LOVE), VTVCab5 (E Channel), VTVCab6 (Hay TV), VTVCab7 (O2TV), VTVCab8 (BiBi), VTVCab9 (Info TV), VTVCab10 (VIE Dramas), VTVCab11 (TV Shopping, now Northern VGS SHOP), VTVCab12 (Style TV), VTVCab14 (Lotte Đất Việt Homeshopping, now VShopping), VTVCab15 (UM Channel), VTVCab16 (Bóng Đá TV), VTVCab17 (Yeah1 TV), VTVCab 18 (Thể Thao TV HD Tin tức), VTVCab19 (FilmTV), VTVCab20 (V Family), VTVCab 21 (BiBi+), VTVCab 22 (Life TV), VTVCab 23 (Golf TV) and about 45 local & international channels. 293x293px Vietnam Multimedia Corporation (VTC) VTC operates five national channels and is the first provider of digital terrestrial television (DTT) in Vietnam.

Prior to 1945, Vietnamese people were banned from owning radio receivers, and broadcasting was under control of the French colonial government, which established the first radio station in Vietnam, Radio Saigon, in the late 1920s. Vietnam's national radio station, now called the Voice of Vietnam, started broadcasting from Hanoi just a week after the declaration of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. During the Vietnam War, Radio Hanoi operated as a propaganda tool of the Democratic Republic of Viet Nam. South Vietnam set up its own network in Saigon in 1955. Following Reunification, all of the radio stations were combined into the Voice of Vietnam, which became the national radio station in 1978. Today, VOV strives to offer diverse, high-quality programming and in every aspect of mass media. It broadcasts on many channels, repeated on Medium wave (MW) AM, FM and shortwave (SW) AM bands throughout Vietnam and the rest of the world: * VOV1 (MW, SW and FM) - news, current affairs and music * VOV2 (MW, SW and FM) - cultural and social programs * VOV3 (MW, SW and FM) - music & entertainment * VOV4 (MW and SW) - ethnic minority language programming * VOV5 (MW, SW and FM) - world service broadcasts in 11 foreign languages * VOV6 (MW, SW and FM) - artistic-oriented programs, currently a block on VOV2 * VOV Transportation (FM) - updating information during rush hours to help people travel smoothly through traffic jams. * VOV English 24/7 (FM) - English-language programs * VOV 89 (FM) - health and safety consumering * VOV News - a website containing news and other aspects * VOVTV (Television Channel)- nationally broadcast which currently aimed at cultural and tourism programs * VOV newspaper 'the Voice of Vietnam'- a printed version with more in-depth contents of VOVnews website As of 2004, it was estimated that VOV's programs reached more than 90% of all households in Vietnam.

The measure has had the effect of almost doubling the numbers of newspapers and magazines since 1996. The first Vietnamese-language newspaper was the French-sponsored Gia Định Bao, established in Saigon in 1869. In the years that followed, both the nationalistic and the colonial sides relied on newspapers as a propaganda tool. During the final period of French colonialism many reporters were arrested and imprisoned and several newspaper offices closed by the authorities. For Ho Chi Minh's revolutionary side, Vietnamese journalists covered the First Indochina War. After the war, presses were set up in Hanoi and the basis for the country's newspaper industry as it exists today was formed, with the main Communist Party organ, Nhan Dan (The People), established in 1951. Current large Vietnamese-language newspapers include Tuoi Tre (Youth, published in Ho Chi Minh City, described as a \\"reformist\\" newspaper), Thanh Nien (Youth), Người Lao Động (Labour or The Worker), Tien Phong (Vanguard), Sai Gon Giai Phong (Liberated Saigon), and Hànộimới (New Hanoi). Prominent French language newspapers included Saigon Eco, the only that currently is published is Le Courrier du Vietnam. There are other, smaller provincial newspapers such as the Ba Ria Vung Tau Daily Newspaper. The largest online newspapers are Zing.vn, VnExpress, VietNamNet, Tuổi Trẻ, Thanh Niên, Dân Trí, VTC News, and VietnamPlus.

Growing up he was involved with the St. George Greek Orthodox Cathedral community in Greenville, and the American Hellenic Educational Progressive Association (AHEPA). Theodore attended the University of Georgia and graduated in 1952 from Furman University with a Bachelors in Business. He spent a total of 24 years serving in the South Carolina state legislature before being elected in 1986 to the office of lieutenant governor having beaten Republican Congressman Thomas F. Hartnett to the position. He served two full terms in that post under Republican Governor Carroll Campbell. Ironically, it was fellow Greenville resident Campbell who, in 1978, had defeated Theodore in an election to the United States House of Representatives from South Carolina's 4th congressional district, one of famed political strategist Lee Atwater's first major triumphs. Despite this history, and the differences in their political philosophies and party affiliations, Campbell and Theodore worked together quite effectively during their two terms in office, and remained friendly with each other. At the conclusion of Campbell's two terms in office, Theodore ran for governor in 1994, defeating Charleston Mayor Joseph P. Riley, Jr. to secure the Democratic nomination. Theodore lost to Campbell's protégé David Beasley, however, in the general election. Four years later in 1998 he tried to regain his former post as lieutenant governor but lost in the general election to incumbent Bob Peeler (R). In 2002, Theodore came out of a quasi-retirement to accept an interim appointment to the South Carolina Public Service Commission, ending in 2004. In 2006, his son, Drew Theodore, became the Democratic nominee for the statewide office of Comptroller General. == Bibliography == * Trials and Triumphs: South Carolina's Evolution, 1962-2014: Political Memoirs and Personal Memories of Nick Theodore (Faith Printing Company, Taylors, SC: 2014). == External links == * Nick A.

Print devices without this capability can only print on a single side of paper, sometimes called single-sided printing or simplex printing. Consumer and low-to-medium volume office printers use a duplexing unit that reverses a piece of paper after the first side has been printed. Duplex multifunction printers that also support duplex scanning have a reversing automatic document feeder (RADF) for scanning both sides. Higher volume printers may effectively have two print engines in a single device, and are able to print both sides of the paper in a single pass. ==Overview== Duplex print devices, depending on options, software, and printer settings, can print single-sided page to single-sided page (1:1) or double-sided page to double-sided page (2:2). Many can also combine single-sided pages into a double-sided page format (1:2). Double-sided booklet formats (2:2 with a center fold) are also available, depending on optional outputs from the printer. Duplexed documents can be printed to be bound on either the short edge or the long edge. This functionality is mostly available on printers that come with a duplexer. Long edge binding in portrait mode allows pages to be turned side-to-side like a book. Short-edge binding allows the pages to be oriented correctly if they are flipped vertically, as in a notepad. This second form of printing/binding is sometimes known as \\"tumble.\\" If the printing is done in landscape mode, these concepts are transposed since the print direction is different. Single-sided printers can print both sides of the paper by manually removing and turning over a stack of sheets after one side is printed; however, the user has to manually turn the print job over and re-initialize the printing of the document, with care to ensure that the order and orientation is correct. In commercial printing (books, magazines, newspapers, etc.), the term applied to imparting an image to both sides of the substrate at the same time is 'perfecting' and is commonly achieved—especially in lithography—by passing the substrate through a perfecting drum, thus turning the sheet over after the first side is printed. The turned sheet then continues its way through the press, being gripped at the opposite edge whilst the second side is printed. This in effect tumbles the job; therefore, accurate sheet sizing is necessary to ensure accurate backing up of the job. Some printers only support duplexing if an optional attachment is fitted. ==References== Category:Printing terminology Category:Computer printers fr:Imprimante#Recto-Verso ","title":"Duplex printing"},{"id":"5561989","text":"Martha Thomas may refer to: *M.

The alliance was created as part of a joint- cooperative effort that would strengthen and modernize the failing Ottoman military, as well as provide Germany safe passage into neighboring British colonies.Frank G. Weber, Eagles on the Crescent: Germany, Austria, and the diplomacy of the Turkish alliance, 1914-1918 (Cornell University Press, 1970).. ==Background== On the eve of the First World War, the Ottoman Empire was in ruinous shape. As a result of successive wars fought in this period, many of its territories were lost, its economy was in shambles and its subjects were demoralized and tired. The Empire needed time to recover and to carry out reforms, but the world was sliding into war and the Empire didn't have time. After the Italo-Turkish War and Balkan Wars, the Empire's resources were completely drained. Since remaining neutral and focusing on recovery wasn't going to be possible due to the First World War, the Empire had to ally with one or the other camp. There were not adequate quantities of weaponry and machinery left; and neither did the Empire have the financial means to purchase new ones. The only option for the Sublime Porte was to establish an alliance with a European power, though it did not really matter which one. As Talat Paşa, the Minister of Interior, wrote in his memoirs: “Turkey needed to join one of the country groups so that it could organize its domestic administration, strengthen and maintain its commerce and industry, expand its railroads, in short, to survive and to preserve its existence.”Alan Woods, The First World War: A Marxist Analysis of the Great Slaughter (2019) ch. 8. Negotiating alliances Most European powers were not interested in joining an alliance with the ailing Ottoman Empire. Already at the beginning of the Turco-Italian War in Northern Africa, the Grand Vizier Sait Halim Paşa had expressed the government’s desire, and the Turkish ambassadors were asked to find out whether the European capitals would be interested. Only Russia seemed to have an interest – however, under conditions that would have amounted a Russian protectorate on the Ottoman lands. It was impossible to reconcile an alliance with the French: as France’s main ally was Russia, the long-time enemy of the Ottoman Empire since the War of 1828. Great Britain declined an Ottoman request. Strachan, The First World War: Volume I: To Arms. Vol. 1 (2003) pp 644-93. The Ottoman Sultan Mehmed V specifically wanted the Empire to remain a non-belligerent nation. However, he was more of a figurehead and did not control the government. Pressure from some of Mehmed’s senior advisors led the Empire to enter an alliance with Germany and the Central Powers. Germany had harbored imperial ambitions since 1890. Germany's imperial ambitions had not borne fruit and by 1909 it became clear that Germans would not prevail in the naval arms race. Even with technological superiority, Germany's energy infrastructure would be unable to support battleships in distant waters. Germany was weak relative to the other European colonial powers and sought a strategic alliance with the Ottoman Empire. The Baghdad Railway would have advanced Germany's imperial ambitions, including the settlement of Germans in Anatolia, and would have given Germans greater flexibility in transporting their troops to the Persian gulf and on to British-occupied India. Germany needed the Ottoman Empire on its side. The Orient Express had run directly to Constantinople since 1889, and prior to the First World War the Sultan had consented to a plan to extend it through Anatolia to Baghdad under German auspices. This would strengthen the Ottoman Empire's link with industrialized Europe, while also giving Germany easier access to its African colonies and to trade markets in India. To keep the Ottoman Empire from joining the Triple Entente, Germany encouraged Romania and Bulgaria to join the Central Powers. Hew Strachan, The First World War: Volume I: To Arms. Vol. 1 (2003) pp 644-93. ==Treaty with Germany== A secret treaty was concluded between the Ottoman Empire and the German Empire on August 2, 1914. The Ottoman Empire was to enter the war on the side of the Central Powers one day after the German Empire declared war on Russia.. The alliance was ratified on 2 August by many high-ranking Ottoman officials, including Grand Vizier Said Halim Pasha, the Minister of War Enver Pasha, the Interior Minister Talat Pasha, and Head of Parliament Halil Bey. Gerard E. Silberstein, \\"The Central Powers and the Second Turkish Alliance, 1915.\\" Slavic Review 24.1 (1965): 77-89. in JSTOR Austria-Hungary adhered to the Ottoman–German treaty on 5 August. However, not all members of the Ottoman government accepted the Alliance. There was no signature from the Sultan Mehmed V, who was nominally in charge of the army but had little power. The third member of the cabinet of the Three Pashas Djemal Pasha also did not sign the treaty as he had tried to form an alliance with France. . Berlin grew annoyed as the Ottomans stalled, but offered two ships and a large loan. On the 29 October 1914, the Ottoman Empire entered the war after its fleet bombarded Russian ports on orders from Enver Pasha. F.W.

It is a topic of growing interest within literary studies since the 1980s. Migrants are people who have left their homes and cultural settings and who started a new life in another setting that is, in most cases, initially strange to them. ==Settings== Although any experience of migration would qualify an author to be classed under migrant literature, the main focus of recent research has been on the principal channels of mass-migration in the twentieth century. These include: European migration to North America or Australia; migration from former colonies to Europe (Black British literature, British-Asian literature, French Beur literature); situations of ethnic cleansing such as the mass migration of people from India to Pakistan and vice versa at the time of the partition of India; guest worker programs (Turks, Italians or Greeks in Germany and Holland); exile situations, such as that of exiled German dissidents during the Nazi period. ==Themes== Migrant literature often focuses on the social contexts in the migrants' country of origin which prompt them to leave, on the experience of migration itself, on the mixed reception which they may receive in the country of arrival, on experiences of racism and hostility, and on the sense of rootlessness and the search for identity which can result from displacement and cultural diversity. ==Relationship to post-colonial literature== Colonialism often creates a setting which results in the migration of large numbers of people, either within the colonies or from them to the \\"imperial centre\\" (Britain, France etc.). Consequently, migrant literature and postcolonial literature show some considerable overlap. However, not all migration takes place in a colonial setting, and not all postcolonial literature deals with migration. A question of current debate is the extent to which postcolonial theory also speaks to migration literature of non-colonial settings. The presence in central Europe of Gastarbeiter communities, for example, is not a result of colonialism, yet their literature does have much in common with, say, British-Asian literature. ==Categories== A number of categories have been developed for discussing migrant literature. Some of these are the standard categories of post-colonial theory, while others have been worked out precisely to cope with non-colonial settings. Displacement Displacement is a key term in post-colonial theory which applies to all migrant situations. It refers both to physical displacement and a sense of being socially or culturally \\"out of place\\". Guest and host communities Picking up on the term Gastarbeiter and using it affirmatively, Rafik Schami has used the terminology of guest and host to express some of the dynamics of migrant situations. Emigrant versus immigrant perspectives It is possible to distinguish the \\"emigrant perspective\\" of the migrant whose main focus is backwards to the country of origin from the \\"immigrant perspective\\" of the migrant who is reconciled with the prospect of permanent residence in the country of arrival.Terminology first proposed in Graeme Dunphy, \\"Migrant, Emigrant, Immigrant: Recent Developments in Turkish-Dutch Literature\\", Neophilologus, 85 (2001) 1-23. Primary and secondary migration In relation to work migration, it is common for one member of a family, typically the father, to travel in search of work, the rest of the family following later. In the context of migration and family ties, \\"secondary migration\\" refers to the emigration of relatives to join the primary migrant. (Alternatively, in other context related to migration, the expression \\"secondary migration\\" is also used to refer to the migration of an immigrant from their country of residence that is not their country of birth to yet another country. Sometimes it is also used to refer to the internal migration of an immigrant, that is, the migration of an immigrant to another state within the country of residence.) First and second generation migrants First generation migrants are those who, as adults, themselves made the move from one country to another. Second generation migrants are the children of migrants, who were either very young at the time of migration or were born in the country of arrival. The perspectives across the generations can differ enormously. Some critics have even used the term \\"third generation migrants\\", though it is highly questionable whether this is meaningful: if a third generation is still culturally distinct it is probably more useful to speak of an established ethnic minority. Between cultures In literature of second generation migrants, a location \\"between\\" two cultures, sometimes called an \\"interstitial\\" space, is often mentioned as a way of expressing a sense of belonging in neither the guest nor the host community. Those whose experience has been more positive may reject the notion of \\"between\\" and feel that they live, rather, in the cultural overlap, not a void but a place of particular richness. Hybridity Hybridity is another catch-phrase from post-colonial theory which applies also in many non-colonial migrant situations. It refers to the migrant's culturally mixed identity as the opposed forces of assimilation and the search for roots force a middle way. (In post-colonial theory, the term hybridity is also used in non-migrant situations to refer to the impact of the culture of the colonisers on the culture of the colonised.) Bilingual theory Bilingualism is an essential component of hybridity. Results of socio-linguistic research are therefore of importance to work on migrant literature. ==See also== * Creolisation * Postcolonialism * Postmodernism * Edward Said * Homi K.

FIFA has defended its policies by pointing out that all of its profits from the World Cup are invested back into worldwide football. ==Examples of sponsorship== As sporting events have become increasingly commercialized, a wide variety of sponsorship opportunities have emerged - or been created - and the 2006 FIFA World Cup was no different. Hyundai Motor Company supplied team buses for each of the thirty-two finalists, and held a contest to decide the team bus slogans. Adidas supplied fifteen personalized match balls for every match of the tournament. Each \\"Teamgeist\\" ball has the name of the stadium, the national teams, the date of the match and the kickoff time are printed. The balls used for the final match were gold, rather than the normal white. Casio acted as the official timekeeper and provided giant countdown clocks in 8 cities across Germany to promote the oncoming tournament. The tournament itself also had a myriad of 'official' items including an official video game (2006 FIFA World Cup) and song (\\"The Time of Our Lives\\", sung by Il Divo and Toni Braxton). The fifteen official partners of the 2006 World Cup were: Adidas, Budweiser, Avaya, Coca-Cola, Continental, Deutsche Telekom, Emirates, Fujifilm, Gillette, Hyundai, MasterCard, McDonald's, Philips, Toshiba, and Yahoo!. As companies who are not sponsors are not allowed to have their names overly associated with the World Cup, FIFA temporarily renamed seven of the twelve stadiums to \\"FIFA World Cup Stadium, [Name of City].\\" ==Revenue== FIFA raised €1.9bn in marketing revenue and €700m from sponsorship from the 2006 World Cup. The 2006 FIFA World Cup has fifteen \\"Official Partners,\\" each thought to have paid €40 million for the privilege. It has a further six \\"National Partners,\\" who paid €13m each for local advertising rights. ==Sponsor controversies== There has been some controversy about several of FIFA’s sponsors. FIFA has been criticized for taking on McDonald's as a sponsor because many feel the chain’s unhealthy food should not be connected to a sporting event. Budweiser also has endured criticism for being the official beer of the World Cup in a country where, because it contains rice and fails the German Reinheitsgebot, it cannot be sold as a beer. Because of a longstanding copyright dispute with Czech brewery Budweiser Budvar it can also not be sold under the name of Budweiser in Germany. Anheuser-Busch signed its sponsorship deal with FIFA before the 2006 World Cup’s host country was chosen, and opted to advertise the brand as Bud 百威, combining the first three letters of its English brand name with its Chinese brand name. Budweiser is the only sponsor with non English writing on its billboards. During the first round match between the Netherlands and Ivory Coast, over 1,000 Dutch fans who arrived at the stadium wearing orange lederhosen were forced to remove their trousers because the lederhosen had the logo of Dutch brewery Bavaria. Bavaria, who had sold the lederhosen as part of an offer, was accused by FIFA of \\"ambush marketing\\" at the expense of American beer maker Budweiser who had paid millions of Euro to sponsor the competition and for the title of \\"Official Beer of the 2006 World Cup.\\" In April 2007, MasterCard sued FIFA for reneging on a World Cup credit card sponsorship deal after it had awarded the sponsorship to VISA. MasterCard had the right of first refusal to sponsor the 2010 and 2014 World Cups but was not given the opportunity to do so. On Dec. 7, 2006, MasterCard won its US federal lawsuit against FIFA. The judge issued a ruling stating that FIFA had breached the contract and that MasterCard was entitled to sponsor the next two World Cups. The judge also brought to light that FIFA officials had repeatedly lied to both MasterCard and VISA during the negotiations. Ticket availability FIFA allocated approximately one in six of the 3.1 million World Cup tickets to its sponsors. Each of the fifteen official partners received 25,000 World Cup tickets, while the six national partners split a total of 115,000. This has led to FIFA being heavily criticized for not making enough tickets available to fans. ==See also== * 2006 FIFA World Cup * FIFA * FIFA World Cup ==References== Sponsorship ","title":"2006 FIFA World Cup sponsorship"},{"id":"5562072","text":"Adam Musiał (born December 18, 1948) is a retired Polish football player and later a football manager.

It is a tributary of the Lamprey River, part of the Great Bay and Piscataqua River watershed leading to the Atlantic Ocean.New Hampshire GRANIT geographic information system The river rises in the northeast corner of Fremont and flows east across flat, swampy terrain through the town of Epping. Upon reaching the town of Newfields, where it is joined by the Fresh River, the river turns northeast and winds through rolling terrain to Newmarket, where it reaches the Lamprey River. The Fresh River joins the Piscassic just upstream from the Piscassic Ice Pond in a marshy area of beaver ponds. ==History== The lower part of the Piscassic River was once used as a canal between Neal's Mills in Newfields and the mouth of the Piscassic at the Lamprey River. A small pond which was used to unload and turn barges is located at the base of a rapids just downstream from the ruins of Neal's Mills, between Piscassic Road bridge and the B&M; railroad bridge in Newfields. A mule track runs along the northwest bank of the Piscassic downstream from the turning pond. A small dam just upstream from the Piscassic Road Bridge forms the Piscassic Ice Pond. A wooden icehouse once stood adjacent to the ice pond, just east of the dam. It had a wooden and iron conveyor leading from the pond to a point a door about 15 feet above the ground. In the early 1900s the ice on the pond was often 18 inches thick. Harvesting crews used large saws to cut ice into 3–4-foot swaths. Teams of horses shod with ice shoes were used to extract and haul the ice to the conveyor. The icehouse had about 2–3 feet inner walls filled with insulating sawdust.

He played college football as a guard at the University of Minnesota from 1926 to 1928. He was captain of the 1928 Minnesota Golden Gophers football team and was named to the 1928 College Football All-America Team. Gibson was a teammate and roommate of Bronko Nagurski. The two are jointly honored as the namesakes of the Minnesota Golden Gophers football training complex, the Gibson-Nagurski Football Complex. Gibson was a professional player and coach in the early National Football League (NFL). In 1930, Gibson joined the Minneapolis Red Jackets as a player- coach. Later that season, he moved to the Frankford Yellow Jackets. His career NFL coaching record was 3–10–1. Gibson was one of eleven All-American football players to appear in the 1930 film Maybe It's Love. After his football career, Gibson earned his Ph.D. in geology from the University of Minnesota and became a geology professor at Carleton College, where he also coached the football team from 1934 to 1938.

Worf's brother Kurn comes aboard the station seeking help to escape the dishonor that has befallen the House of Mogh. Kurn was introduced on Star Trek: The Next Generation (TNG) in \\"Sins of the Father\\" (broadcast March 19, 1990); he is played by actor Tony Todd. ==Plot== Worf gets an unexpected visit from his younger brother Kurn. Kurn confronts Worf about the dishonor Worf has brought upon the House of Mogh after rejecting the Klingon Empire's war with the Cardassian Empire. As a result of Worf's choices, his family has been stripped of its wealth, honor, and political power. Kurn has lost everything, and wants Worf to give him back his honor the only way he can, by having Worf ritually kill him. Worf begins the ceremony, but Jadzia Dax figures out what Worf is planning. She and Odo rush to interrupt the ceremony after Kurn is stabbed; and Dr. Bashir manages to save him. Captain Sisko is furious and forbids Worf from completing the ceremony. Kurn, without an honorable life or death, places himself in Worf's hands. At Dax's suggestion, Worf asks Odo for a favor and gets Kurn a position with Odo's security force. However Kurn loses his job when he allows himself to be shot without any attempt to defend himself. Meanwhile, mysterious explosions and cloaked Klingon vessels have been observed near Bajoran space. Eventually it is discovered that the Klingons are mining the space around Deep Space Nine in preparation for a future war. Worf and Kurn are sent on an undercover mission to discover the mines' locations and activation codes. They are able to access the data, though Kurn is forced to shoot a Klingon officer to defend Worf. Using this intelligence, Major Kira is able to detonate the mines and flush out the cloaked Klingon vessels. Having killed a man acting in defense of the Empire deepens Kurn's depression. Worf is distressed that he did not realize the Klingon officer intended to kill him—feeling that a real Klingon would have. He comes to the conclusion that he is not of the Klingon or human world, but he has his Federation rank, and Kurn has nothing at all. To allow Kurn to live an honorable life as a Klingon, Worf has Dr. Bashir erase Kurn's memory so he can be given a new identity. Kurn—now \\"Rodek\\"—is then entrusted to a family friend who agrees to take him in as a son. In the last scene he looks to Worf and asks him, \\"Are you part of my family?\\", to which Worf replies: \\"I have no family.\\" == Reception == In 2018, SyFy included this episode on their Jadzia Dax binge-watching guide. ==ReferencesExternal links== * * Category:Star Trek: Deep Space Nine (season 4) episodes Category:1996 American television episodes ","title":"Sons of Mogh"},{"id":"5562149","text":"Claude Davis (born 6 March 1979) is a Jamaican former footballer who played as a defender.

MÁVAG company was the second largest industrial enterprise after the Manfréd Weiss Steel and Metal Works in the Hungarian half of the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy. MÁVAG was the property of the Kingdom of Hungary. After the World War II MÁVAG was nationalized, and \\"Királyi\\" (\\"Royal\\") was removed from its name. The company employed thousands of workers. The buildings were in the VIII. district of Budapest, bordered by the following streets: Kőbányai street, Hungária avenue, Vajda Péter street, and Orczy street. It was the most important Hungarian machine factory in the 19th century, along with Csepel Művek (Csepel Factories). The most respected products of MÁVAG were steam locomotives. The first was produced in 1873, and MÁVAG produced the famous locomotive no. 424 from 1924. MÁVAG's neighbouring company was the Ganz motor- és vagongyár (Ganz engine and wagon factory), which manufactured diesel locomotives and luxury carriages for export. Up until 1959 the company produced 7578 locomotives, including the Class 601, the largest steam locomotive type built in Europe up to and during World War I. In 1896, when Hungary celebrated the 1000th anniversary of Hungarian settlement, the 1000th locomotive was exhibited. MÁVAG exported many locomotives: from 1900, to Italy and Romania, later to Egypt, India, Yugoslavia, and Korea. After 1945 the company exported diesel trains to the USSR, and in 1961 became well known there for Д1 local diesel trains. In 1959 MÁVAG merged with the Ganz company and was renamed Ganz-MÁVAG. ==The beginnings== The two plants were purchased by the Hungarian state and placed under joint control on August 1, 1870, founded the Machinery and Wagon Factory of the Hungarian Royal Railways and first handed it over to the management of MÁV and then established its own board. The first director of the factory was Frigyes Zimmermann. After the Austro-Hungarian compromise of 1867, the legal obstacles of the development of national industry were eliminated, and the export of the locomotives became available. Corporate (private) railways have grown, which, along with MÁV, demanded a large number of locomotives and wagons. The factory started production of vehicles in 1872, the first of which was the first domestic production III of 50 coke trucks and according to the plans of the Sigl factory in Vienna. class (later 335 series) freight train steamer in 1873, which was presented at the Vienna World Exhibition that year. Due to the global economic crisis, the company was temporarily reassigned to MÁV. On July 28, 1873, the building of the former Hungarian-Swiss Wagon Factory burnt down, which was rebuilt, but it was no longer a part of the factory, but it became the MÁV's main workshop (→ North Main Workshop). The factory's first own- designed locomotive, number 7, was completed in 1878. For the Tiszavidék Vasút the company produced a C-axis universal locomotive under the name \\"Szolnok\\", which later became MÁV IIId. he was given the 314 series mark, and was introduced at the Paris World Expo in the year. From 1877, the factory started to produce agricultural machinery and threshing machines. In 1880, the Hungarian government merged the factory with the Diósgyőr Ironworks and established a joint management company under the name: \\"Hungarian Royal State Railways Machine Factory and Diósgyőr Hungarian Royal Iron and Steel Factory Directorate, Budapest\\". From 1881 the factory was able to build larger bridges and built several bridges for the MÁV and Kassa-Oderberg Railways, as well as the iron structure of the Keleti Railway Station. The factory was taken over by Zsigmond Kordina from June 1881. The first truly remarkable domestic- developed locomotive was the 1883 10th, MÁV class Ia, and later the 220 Series locomotive. In the same year, the first composite locomotive of the factory was completed in the 15th, MÁV Class 56, 568, and later in the series 20, which was the 75th finished steamer of the factory. From 1884, the company was managed directly by the ministry of commerce. The director of the factory became Nándor Förster from 1890. This year the mill's threshing machine was completed. The factory's 500th steam locomotive is number 28, at MÁV IIIe. Class 2535 (later 326 series) locomotives were handed over on May 31, 1893. The thousandth locomotive, MÁV Int., Number 31, has a 468-track (222 series) locomotive already completed in 1896 and was also presented at the Millennium Exhibition. Also in 1896, the factory made the steel structure of the Újpest railway bridge and the Ferencz József bridge (today: Freedom Bridge). The 1500th locomotive of the factory was built in 1900, Il. class 701 psz. (201/202 series), which is IVd of Structure 46. Class 4405 (422 Series) and Transylvanian Mining Route with Govasdia Narrow Gauge Locomotive won the Grand Prix of the Paris World Expo, similarly to the plant's harvesting and threshing machines and locomotives. From 1900, Károly Vajkay, director of the ironworks, and from 1903 Pál Róth became the director of the Ironworks. ==Golden Era== The 20th century started with an economic downturn: the factory dropped 100 pieces of steam locomotives annually by 1904, almost half of them were made abroad, mainly in Italy. At that time, the vehicle parts of the electric locomotives (VM1 and VM4 factory) produced for the Italian railway, Val Tellina, were also prepared for Ganz & Partners. Also for Ganz and Partner, the factory boiler plant delivered 159 de Dion-Bouton-based steam generators to the Ganz steam engine. The factory's bridging class then worked on major orders: they were built in 1898 and handed over to Budapest  At the time of the construction of the bridge, it was the largest chain bridge of 290 m in the world; Structure Aurél Czekelius, beautiful gates were designed by Virgil Nagy. Steel structures were made by the Hungarian Royal State Ironworks. At this time, the Tisza Bridge of the 400 m long Algyő railway was built. [1] After the recession, steam locomotive production has risen again: by the year 1910, the factory had already produced 250 locomotives per year. In the 1900s, the Hungarian Royal State Iron Works planned and produced a number of steam locomotives of much larger size and power than before. * the 71st-class, in-class (later series 203) high-speed train, * the 84th factory IIIs.

(Classes 74, 92, 93, 110 and 115, and 91, 109, 116). The 324 series of locomotives were produced for decades in the largest number of ever produced Hungarian steam locomotives in a total of 905 units, while 375 locomotives were manufactured for half a century - the latest version of the steam engine was the latest Hungarian version. In 1908, the In. Class was built to 816 (later 203,015) locomotive locomotives in the factory. At that time, the factory's main builder, Zsigmond Kordina, was Dvorak Hubert. The bridgehead then made the Baja-Bátaszék, the Komárom railway and the Danube bridges. For agriculture, CT and XCT road steam locomotives, various locomobiles and steam bricks were built. In the 1910s, with a few exceptions, the factory built only superheated steam locomotives. The two beautiful fast train locomotive types of the era, one of the most powerful 2'C1 'axle locomotives in Europe, are factory-fitted (301) and 102 and 103 (327 series) steam locomotives suitable for slopes with weaker superstructures. Until its outbreak, it produced 22 and 140 copies. The 327,023 steam locomotive delivered in 1913 was a locomotive bearing the factory's 3000th serial number. The Hungarian Royal State Iron Factories have produced the 1051 Series Mallet system of the 1051 series, which is the largest and most powerful locomotive of the age in Europe. Unit 31 was the factory's 4000th factory locomotive, which was completed in 1917. By this time, the annual capacity of the factory exceeded 300, but the demand also required the manufacture of some smaller types in other plants. Due to the war copper deficiency, from 1915 only the Brotan-Deffner-system boilers with steel water pipes were made including the already mentioned 324, 375, 376 and 601 series locomotives. The first suburban locomotives were also completed: the first copies of the three-wheeled 342-series locomotives and the four-wheeled 442-series locomotives. In addition, new 2'C axle-mounted high-speed trains (328 series), 1'D-axle heavy-duty trains (424 series) and C'C-axis Mallet-system trains (620 series) have been designed. However, only the production of the Series 328 series 118 could begin with these types. == Names of the company == * 1870: Hungarian Royal State Railways Machine and Trolley * 1873: Machine Factory of Hungarian Royal Railways (hereafter MÁV Machine Factory) * 1902: Hungarian Royal State Ironworks * 1925: Hungarian Royal State Iron, Steel and Machinery Factory (hereafter: MÁVAG) * 1943: Vitéz Horthy István Hungarian Royal State Iron, Steel and Machine Factory * 1945: Hungarian State Iron, Steel and Machine Factory * 1949: MÁVAG Locomotive and Machine Factory * 1959: Ganz-MÁVAG Locomotive—Wagon and Machine Factory (1988) ==References== * Hungarian Wikipedia: MÁVAG Category:Rolling stock manufacturers of Hungary Category:Locomotive manufacturers of Hungary Category:Manufacturing companies of Hungary Category:Hungarian brands Category:Companies of Austria-Hungary ","title":"MÁVAG"},{"id":"5562215","text":"Bad Urach () is a town in the district of Reutlingen, Baden-Württemberg, Germany. It is situated 14 km east of Reutlingen, at the foot of the Swabian Alb (or Swabian Alps in English), and is known for its spa and therapeutic bath. ==Neighbouring communities== The following towns border Urach, and are also part of the district of Reutlingen. Clockwise from the north are: Hülben, Grabenstetten, Römerstein, Gutsbezirk Münsingen, Münsingen, St. Johann and Dettingen an der Erms. Bad Urach consists of the districts Hengen (687.01 ha; 854 inhabitants, at 31 December 2005), Seeburg (220.65 ha; 302 inhabitants), Sirchingen (481.78 ha; 1031 inhabitants), Bad Urach (2,797, 89 ha; 9289 inhabitants) and Wittlingen (1362.24 ha; 1112 inhabitants). With the exception of the district Bad Urach the neighborhoods form simultaneously villages within the meaning of Baden-Wuerttemberg Municipal Code. Urach includes the homestead of Güterstein. Among the districts Hengen and Sirchingen each include only the villages of the same name. Seeburg includes the village Seeburg, castle and courtyard and the village of Wittlingen, the homestead Hohenwittlingen and the individual houses, Georgenau, the pumping station Ermsgruppe XIII, including Front Albgruppe, Schanz and Villa Mühleisen. In the Hengen district is the castle Gardena. In the district of Bad Urach are the villages Berg, Gyrenbad, Merzhausen, Hausen, Sontheim and Weiler, and in Wittlingen district are the villages Henni fountain, Hofstetten and Winneden and castle Baldeck. ==History== In the early Stone Age, the Alb was already populated, and several caves in the area show evidence that they provided shelter for the inhabitants. During the Alemanni period Bad Urach had an important castle. Owing to its prime location on a hill overlooking the Erms Valley, Hohenurach Castle was built around 1025. In the Middle Ages Bad Urach (at that time only known as Urach) became a centre of power. The castle became a state prison in the late Middle Ages; the poet Philipp Nikodemus Frischlin died while trying to escape over its walls in 1590. In the 18th century, the fortress was razed to the ground by the citizenry. Around 1260 Urach became part of Württemberg. Nearly 100 years later, at the time when Württemberg was divided, the southern part of the region was governed from Urach, the so- called \\"secret capital\\", which was the residential home of the Dukes of Württemberg from 1442 until 1482. Count Eberhard the Bearded was born here in 1445 and returned there frequently throughout his life. Over the next several centuries, the town prospered and became a centre for weaving. It escaped serious damage during any wars and so remains in excellent historical condition. In 1561 to 1565 a institute produced 30000 bibles in Urach and smuggled.smuggler in german In 1867 a cousin of the king of Württemberg was created Duke of Urach, but lived away at Lichtenstein Castle. Since 1985 the town has been a nationally recognized spa town. ==Geology== The Urach volcanic area Several million years ago the area was actively volcanic. Due to an anomaly in the subsurface, the town has a thermal spring with water at 61 °C. The spring was developed to serve a spa operation and mineral thermal baths. In the early part of the 21st century a geothermal project was started, to develop electricity generation and heating in the town. The project failed in 2004 due to insufficient finance. ==Sights== Bad Urach possesses a late- medieval marketplace with a city hall and half-timbered houses that date from the 15th and 16th centuries. The Residenzschloss (Castle Residence), the residential home of the Counts of Württemberg-Urach where Eberhard the Bearded was born, contains rooms that date from the Gothic, Renaissance, and Baroque periods. The Goldener Saal (Golden Hall), one of Germany's loveliest Renaissance rooms, is particularly worth a visit. The Church of Saint Amandus dates from 1477 and was built in the Gothic style for Eberhard the Bearded. His lavish praying desk dates from 1472. The pulpit is decorated with figures of the saints and church fathers and is considered an important piece of German stonemasonry. The 1518 baptismal font is by the sculptor Christoph von Urach. Also of interest are the ruins of the old castle (Schloss Hohenurach) and the waterfall (Uracher Wasserfall) on the hiking trail up to it. The \\"round mountain\\" (\\"Runder Berg\\"), a former volcano, is of archeological interest and shows an old Alemanni castle. ==Economy and infrastructure== Transport The Bundesstraße 28 runs through the city and connects it to the west with Reutlingen and Tübingen and to the east with Ulm. The B 465 leads from Bad Urach to Ehingen and Biberach. The Erms Valley Railway connects Bad Urach with Metzingen, there is connection to the Plochingen-Tübingen railway. The Public transport is guaranteed by the Verkehrsverbund Neckar-Alb- Donau (NALDO). The city is located in the comb 221. ==Court, authorities and bodies== Bad Urach has a District Court, which belongs to the Landgerichtsbezirk Tübingen and Oberlandesgerichtsbezirk Stuttgart. Furthermore, Bad Urach has a tax office (Finanzamt) and with the Ermstal Clinic a hospital.

He was the eldest son of Yunus Khan. He was born in 1462, his mother was Shah Begum, daughter of Badakhshan prince Lali (Shah Sultan Muhammad Badakhshi), who claimed his descent from Alexander the Great and gave one of his six daughters to Yunus Khan in marriage, pleasing his request. Upon his father's death, Mahmud Khan succeeded him in Tashkent and western Moghulistan (present Kyrgyzstan), while his brother Ahmad Alaq had already taken control of eastern Moghulistan (present Xinjiang, China) Mahmud Khan had to defend Tashkent from the Timurids Sultan Ahmad of Samarkand and Omar Shaikh of Ferghana, who resented the loss of the city to Yunus Khan a few years before. Mahmud Khan successfully thwarted their efforts to take Taskhent, and during his fight with Sultan Ahmad gained the defection of one of the men fighting under him, the Uzbek Muhammad Shaybani. As a reward to Muhammad Shaybani, Mahmud Khan gave him land in Russian Turkestan in 1488 (which was named \\"Uzbekistan\\" and eventually evolved into the present country with that name). This move, however, upset the Khazaks, who were enemies of the Uzbeks. Although the Moghuls were traditionally friends with the Khazaks, they went to war with each other, and Mahmud Khan was defeated. Mahmud Khan maintained close and friendly relations with Dughlat Amir Muhammad Husain Mirza and gave his sister Khub Nigar Khanim in marriage to him in 1490, contracting an alliance. Their son was Mirza Muhammad Haidar Dughlat, famous historian and future ruler of Kashmir, born in Tashkent in 1500. In the meantime, both Sultan Ahmad and Omar Shaikh died in 1494; their brother Sultan Mahmud ruled Samarkand for a six months but he died as well and the city passed to his son Baysunkur. Mahmud Khan attempted to wrest Samarkand from Baysunkur, but the Timurids were victorious on the battlefield. Having failed to take Transoxiana himself, Mahmud Khan decided to support Muhammad Shaybani, whose forces sharply increased from 3,000 to 50,000. The Uzbeks took Samarkand in 1501, but soon turned against his Moghul supporters. With Muhammad Shaybani threatening Mahmud Khan, Ahmad Alaq came from the east and the two brothers advanced against the Uzbeks. They were, however, defeated in the Battle of Akhsi, 1503 and taken prisoner. Muhammad Shaybani let them go but retained the Moghul soldiers and seized control of Tashkent. Shortly after the defeat, Ahmad Alaq died and his realm fell to his sons. Mahmud Khan invaded from the west with the remnants of his followers, but ignored the towns, settling in the steppes of Moghulistan. Here he lived a difficult life for five years, before deciding to present himself before Muhammad Shaybani, in the hope that he would show some favor to him. Muhammad Shaybani, however, had the khan and all of his five sons killed on the bank of Syr Darya river near Khujand in 1508. ==Family== ;Consort *Rabia Sultan Begum, daughter of Sultan Ahmed Mirza and Qatak Begum, and mother of Baba Khan; ;Daughters He had three daughters: *Zainab Sultan Khanum, married to Sultan Said Khan Chaghatai; *Aisha Sultan Khanum, married to Muhammad Shaybani; *Qutlugh Khanum, married to Jani Beg Khan Uzbeg; ==References== Category:1462 births Category:1508 deaths Category:Chagatai khans Category:Uyghurs ","title":"Mahmud Khan (Moghul Khan)"},{"id":"5562306","text":"The International Security Alliance (ISA) is a fictional spy agency on the soap opera Days of Our Lives. A highly secretive organization, its agents have been operating in the Midwestern town of Salem at least since the early 1980s. Several of Salem's more recognizable citizens have served at one time or another as agents for the ISA, including Roman Brady, John Black, and Rafe Hernandez. Agents formerly on the show include Shane Donovan, Bo Brady, Steve Johnson, Billie Reed, and Philip Kiriakis. The agency was conceived as a multinational crime-fighting task force, well-funded and highly secretive, with agents and operations all over the world. Made up of mostly British and American agents, the ISA's focus tends to be more toward crime-fighting than actual espionage. The agency specializes in the sort of high-level, international criminal conspiracies that center in the otherwise quiet town of Salem -- such as those controlled by the DiMera, Kiriakis, and Alamain families, as well as the \\"Phantom Alliance\\" established by John Black's father Timothy Robecheaux (aka Yo Ling). The multinational element is often illustrated by the fact that American agents refer to \\"headquarters\\" as being in Washington, D.C., while British agents such as the aforementioned Donovan typically report to London. The show's writers present the ISA with a somewhat muddled (and unrealistic) mission--the criminal investigation mandate of Interpol or the FBI, combined with the methodology of the CIA or military \\"black ops\\". Some of the agency's methods come straight out of Robert Ludlum or Ian Fleming, including sophisticated gadgets, top-secret operations, and such questionable actions as kidnapping, blackmail, corruption, and assassination. The organization works fairly openly with local police, \\"undercover\\" agents readily identify themselves as ISA members, and they have legal arrest powers in their own right. The ISA also has several advanced scientific and medical facilities throughout the world, dealing with problems encountered by its agents such as brainwashing and biological warfare. However effective it may be, the ISA appears to be highly susceptible to infiltration, counterespionage, and corruption by its targets. The agency also experiences both partnerships and conflicts with real-life agencies such as the FBI and the CIA. ISA directors depicted on the show include chiefs Nickerson, Vaughn, Tarrington, and Van Damme. None of these officials have shied away from unsavory actions to meet their objectives, and most (except Tarrington) have proven to be outright corrupt, if not psychotic. In fact, the agency itself occasionally finds itself acting as badly (or worse) than its targets.

His managerial career includes spells at Swansea City, Leeds United, Middlesbrough and Birmingham City. He played for Swansea City in all four divisions of professional football from 2004 to 2014, for the majority of that time as captain. He played 270 matches for Swansea in all competitions over ten seasons, and was part of their team which won the 2013 Football League Cup Final. ==Playing career== Early career Born in Bedford, Bedfordshire, Monk began his career as a trainee with Torquay United, making five appearances during the 1995–96 season, whilst still a trainee after growing up in Torquay for the majority of his youth. At the end of that season he moved to Southampton to complete his apprenticeship and turned professional with them in May 1997. Monk returned to Torquay on loan in September 1998 and on returning to the Dell immediately broke into the first team squad, making his first team debut against Derby County on 28 November 1998 in place of the injured Ken Monkou. In September 1999, he had a loan spell at Stockport County, before being recalled to the first team for two matches in January 2000. He later had a loan spell at Oxford United (in January 2001), but was recalled from Oxford by Glenn Hoddle owing to an injury crisis amongst the Southampton defenders. In May 2001, he started in both of the last two home matches at The Dell, against Manchester United and Arsenal, both of which resulted in victories. Monk had a longer loan spell with Sheffield Wednesday (from December 2002 to 20 March) with a view to a permanent transfer, which failed to materialise after Wednesday's relegation to Division Two. He eventually left the Saints in February 2004, signing for Barnsley on a free transfer, having been on loan for the previous three months. He struggled to settle in at Oakwell, but scored his first career goal in a 2–1 home FA Cup win against Bristol City on 16 December, and moved to Swansea City on a free transfer in June 2004. Swansea City Monk warming up for Swansea before a League Two match at Bury during the 2004–05 season Monk made his debut for Swansea on 7 August 2004 in their 0–2 defeat to Northampton Town at Vetch Field on the first day of the new League Two season. On 4 September, he was given a straight red card in the 84th minute of the match away to Yeovil Town, for conceding a penalty on Phil Jevons, converted by Gavin Williams for the only goal of the match. Monk was again sent off on 20 November in a 0–2 defeat at Shrewsbury Town for pushing over referee Eddie Ellans in the 43rd minute; teammate Andy Robinson was also dismissed two minutes later. He received a third red card on 8 February 2005 for two bookings in a minute during a 0–1 defeat at Mansfield Town. Swansea finished the season with promotion to League One. On 22 November 2005, Monk scored his first goal for Swansea, heading their third as they reached the quarter-final of the Football League Trophy with a 4–0 win over Rushden & Diamonds at the Liberty Stadium. The first league goal of his career came on 14 January 2006, opening a 1–1 draw away to Bradford City from Robinson's corner just before half time. Swansea defeated Brentford in the play-off semi-finals, but lost in a penalty shootout to Barnsley in the final at the Millennium Stadium on 27 May. Monk played the full 120 minutes in the final, and put in the cross from which Rory Fallon equalised with an overhead kick. In August 2006, following the release of Roberto Martínez, it was announced he Monk become the captain for the forthcoming season. However, just two matches into the 2006–07 season, he picked up a cruciate ligament injury in an innocuous-looking challenge with Scunthorpe striker Andy Keogh, which ruled him out for the whole campaign and with his contract running out at the end of the season his future was in doubt. Monk returned to the team at the beginning of the 2007–08 season as skipper, captaining the Swans to promotion to the second tier of English football for the first time in 24 years. Monk lifted his first piece of silverware as Swansea captain as the team sealed promotion as League One champions with a club record 92 points. He contributed one goal during the campaign, a header in a 3–2 home win over Leeds United. The 2008–09 season brought Monk a new central defensive partner in Ashley Williams, signed from Stockport County towards the end of the previous campaign, as Alan Tate was dropped from the side. On 9 August, the opening day of the Championship season, Monk was sent off for a foul on Matt Holland in a 0–2 defeat to Charlton Athletic at The Valley. His only goal of the season was the home winner against Bristol City on 18 April 2009, heading in Andrea Orlandi's corner after 25 minutes. In their first season back in the Championship, Swansea finished 8th. In the 2009–10 season, Swansea missed out on a Championship play-off place on the final day of the season. On 11 August, in the first round of the League Cup, Monk headed Swansea's first goal of a 3–0 win over Brighton & Hove Albion. Two weeks later, he was one of three Swansea players sent off – alongside Àngel Rangel and Gorka Pintado – as the team lost 1–2 after extra time at home against Scunthorpe United in the second round. Following Paulo Sousa's exit to join Championship rivals Leicester City, Monk criticised his former manager, saying his tactics and training methods were not good enough. Monk's 2012 autobiography Loud, Proud and Positive would later reveal that the Portuguese manager and his captain rarely saw eye to eye. The 2010–11 season started well, as Monk played every match until picking up an injury against Colchester United in the FA Cup on 8 January 2011. He would soon return to the side, however, and captain the Swans to a place in the Premier League via a Championship Play-off Final win against Reading. Monk's contribution would be rewarded with a new three-year contract, keeping him at the club until 2014. On 6 February 2013, Monk signed a one-year contract extension at Swansea, keeping him at the club until June 2015. Later that month, Monk won the first major trophy of his career as Swansea, under manager Michael Laudrup, beat Bradford City 5–0 in the 2013 League Cup Final at Wembley Stadium. Monk lifted the cup together with Ashley Williams after coming on as a 62nd-minute substitute for Ki Sung-yueng in the Final in a 5–0 win against Bradford City. After making only 15 appearances across all competitions in the 2012–13 season, 11 of which were in the Premier League, Monk passed Swansea captaincy on to Ashley Williams, who had worn it in Monk's absences during the previous two years. ==Managerial career== Swansea City On 4 February 2014, Monk was appointed by chairman Huw Jenkins as interim player-manager following the sacking of manager Michael Laudrup. His first match in charge was the South Wales derby on 8 February against Cardiff City, which Swansea won 3–0 with all three goals scored in the second half. After finishing second in their Europa League Group A behind Valencia, Monk's Swansea reached the round of 32, in which they were knocked out by Rafa Benítez's Napoli side after losing 3–1 on aggregate. Swansea survived a relegation battle and secured safety with one match to spare. Monk became the permanent manager of Swansea City on 7 May 2014, signing a three-year contract. In the opening match of the 2014–15 season, Monk led Swansea to a 2–1 away win against Manchester United, the club's first ever league win at Old Trafford. The Swans continued their positive start to the league season with two home wins against Burnley and West Bromwich Albion, a run of results which saw Swansea sit joint top of the Premier League table and Monk pick up the Premier League Manager of the Month for August. After Swansea's 2–1 defeat to Stoke City on 19 October 2014, Monk claimed that Stoke's Victor Moses had dived for a penalty, and said it was \\"disgusting\\" of referee Michael Oliver to award it. Although interviewed by the FA and warned about his conduct in media interviews, Monk was not charged over these statements. On 11 May 2015, Swansea recorded the double over Arsenal, making the Swans only the third side in Premier League history to have won home and away against both Arsenal and Manchester United in the same season. The Swans ended the season in eighth position with a record points tally. Monk signed a new three-year contract in July 2015. After 12 years association with the club, Monk was sacked by Swansea on 9 December 2015 following a run of one win in 11 Premier League matches, which left the club 15th in the table. As a result of Monk's sacking, coaches Pep Clotet, James Beattie and Kristian O'Leary also left the club. Leeds United On 2 June 2016, Monk was appointed head coach of Championship club Leeds United on a one-year rolling contract, replacing previous head coach Steve Evans. Monk made his first signing as Leeds head coach on 28 June 2016, with the addition of Swedish striker Marcus Antonsson for a fee around £2 million. On 7 August, Monk's first match in charge of Leeds was against Q.P.R. in a 3–0 defeat on the opening day of The Championship season. Monk's first victory came in the following match on 10 August with a 5–4 penalty shootout victory for Leeds after a 2–2 draw after extra time against Fleetwood Town. In November 2016, after guiding Leeds to sixth place and into the Championship play-off positions and also the quarter finals of the EFL League Cup, Monk was nominated for the Championship Manager of the Month award for October; however, he narrowly missed out with the award going to Newcastle United's Rafa Benitez. On 29 November 2016, Monk's Leeds were knocked out of the EFL Cup after losing a quarter-final match against Jürgen Klopp's Liverpool at Anfield in a 2–0 defeat, however Leeds had put on an impressive performance against the then Premier League leaders After beating Brentford 1–0 on 17 December, Monk's Leeds were 5th in the playoff positions in the Championship during Christmas 2016, which had been their highest position at this time of the season since Simon Grayson's Leeds side in 2010. After making several changes to his team, Monk's Leeds side suffered a shock FA Cup exit on 29 January 2017 to the hands of Sutton United after suffering a 1–0 defeat. On 27 February, Monk received a touchline ban after a pitchside spat with Huddersfield Town manager David Wagner, with Monk blocking Wagner's run, after Wagner ran across the pitch to celebrate a goal with his players, the spat started a pitch side tussle between players and staff of both clubs. After beating Brighton 2–0 on 19 March 2017, Leeds were firmly in the playoff positions and in the hunt for automatic promotion, having pulled 11 points clear of 7th place. However, after a dramatic loss of form in the final 8 matches of the season, Leeds mathematically missed out on the playoffs on the final day of the season, finishing in 7th place after being overtaken by Fulham. After the takeover of Leeds by Andrea Radrizzani two days earlier, and the day before Leeds were set to activate a 1-year contract extension with the option of exploring a longer-term deal, on 25 May, Monk resigned as Leeds United head coach, with Radrizzani saying that Monk's decision to quit the club had been a 'shock'. Middlesbrough On 9 June 2017, Monk was appointed as the manager of newly relegated Championship club Middlesbrough, replacing caretaker manager, Steve Agnew. Upon his appointment, Monk stated that he aimed to have the club promoted immediately back to the Premier League. Monk's first signings for the club came on 7 July, when he signed Cyrus Christie from Derby County and Jonny Howson from Norwich City. Two days later, he brought in Martin Braithwaite from Toulouse, and later secured the signing of Britt Assombalonga from Nottingham Forest. His first game as manager came on 12 July 2017 in a goalless draw against Oxford United in Albufeira, Portugal. Later that month, Monk brought in Darren Randolph, and Ashley Fletcher, both arriving from West Ham United. Later that transfer window, Monk loaned in Lewis Baker from Chelsea, and Connor Roberts from Swansea City. On 23 December 2017, it was announced that Monk had left the club, to be replaced by Tony Pulis three days later. Birmingham City Monk was appointed manager of Championship club Birmingham City on 4 March 2018. He signed a three-and-a-half-year deal, and became Birmingham's fifth permanent manager in 15 months. With the team in danger of relegation, he led them to five wins out of the eleven matches remaining; a final-day defeat of promotion candidates Fulham secured a 19th-place finish. In his post-match interview, Monk insisted that the habitual struggle against relegation was unacceptable, he would be \\"relentless\\" in raising the mentality throughout the club, and \\"whoever is not on board with that won't be here.\\" He excluded several players, including both senior goalkeepers, from consideration for the 2018–19 first team. Operating under an EFL-imposed business plan and with a likely points deduction pending for the club's breaches of the league's Profitability and Sustainability rules, Monk was able to sign one player for a fee and up to five loans or free transfers on wages pitched at a \\"debilitating\\" level. After a slow start to the season, four wins in October earned Monk a nomination as Championship Manager of the Month as the team rose to ninth in the table. According to the Birmingham Mail, he turned them into \\"a side vastly superior than the sum of its parts\\" to keep them in the top half of the table until a run of losses in March and a nine-point deduction meant they were again in a relegation battle; they finished 17th. In June 2019, it was reported that the relationship between Monk and chief executive Xuandong Ren had broken down, with Ren dissatisfied with Monk's playing style and plans for the new season and Monk unhappy at the sale of the creative Jota. After making it clear he would not resign, Monk was sacked on 18 June. A club statement with echoes of Monk's own of a year earlier called for a change in footballing philosophy and stressed the vital importance of \\"everybody at the club to be sharing the same vision and commitment to the plans and processes.\\" Sheffield Wednesday On 6 September 2019, Monk was appointed as manager at Sheffield Wednesday, replacing Steve Bruce who resigned a few months prior. He signed a contract of an unspecified length. In November 2019 when Wednesday were set to play former club Birmingham, now managed by his former assistant Pep Clotet, Monk spoke negatively about Clotet in his pre- match press conference in addition to refusing to shake his hand after the match. When the two managers faced each other again in the reverse fixture later in the season however, Monk and Clotet shook hands and appeared to settle their differences. ==Career statistics== { class= style=text- align:center + Appearances and goals by club, season and competition - !rowspan=2Club !rowspan=2Season !colspan=3League !colspan=2FA Cup !colspan=2League Cup !colspan=2Other !colspan=2Total - !DivisionAppsGoalsAppsGoalsAppsGoalsAppsGoalsAppsGoals - Torquay United 1995–96 Third Division 5000000050 - rowspan=9Southampton 1996–97 Premier League 000000colspan=2—00 - 1997–98 Premier League 000000colspan=2—00 - 1998–99 Premier League 4010000050 - 1999–2000 Premier League 20colspan=2—00colspan=2—20 - 2000–01 Premier League 200000colspan=2—20 - 2001–02 Premier League 200010colspan=2—30 - 2002–03 Premier League 100000colspan=2—10 - 2003–04 Premier League 00colspan=2—000000 - !colspan=2Total !110101000130 - Torquay United (loan) 1998–99 Third Division 60colspan=2—colspan=2—colspan=2—60 - Stockport County (loan) 1999–2000 First Division 20colspan=2—20colspan=2—40 - Oxford United (loan) 2000–01 Second Division 50colspan=2—colspan=2—colspan=2—50 - Sheffield Wednesday (loan) 2002–03 First Division 15000colspan=2—colspan=2—150 - Barnsley 2003–04 Second Division 17041colspan=2—colspan=2—211 - rowspan=11Swansea City 2004–05 League Two 340401020410 - 2005–06 League One 331000091422 - 2006–07 League One 2000000020 - 2007–08 League One 321302060431 - 2008–09 Championship 4013030colspan=2—461 - 2009–10 Championship 2301021colspan=2—261 - 2010–11 Championship 290113030361 - 2011–12 Premier League 1602000colspan=2—180 - 2012–13 Premier League 1100041colspan=2—151 - 2013–14 Premier League 000010colspan=2—10 - !colspan=2Total !22031411622012707 - !colspan=3Career total !28131921922013398 } ==Managerial statistics== { class= style=text-align:center + Managerial record by team and tenure - !rowspan=2Team !rowspan=2From !rowspan=2To !colspan=5Record !rowspan=2 - ! - align=leftSwansea City align=left4 February 2014 align=left9 December 2015  - align=leftLeeds United align=left2 June 2016 align=left25 May 2017  - align=leftMiddlesbrough align=left9 June 2017 align=left23 December 2017  - align=leftBirmingham City align=left4 March 2018 align=left18 June 2019  - align=leftSheffield Wednesday align=left6 September 2019 align=leftPresent  - !colspan=3Total ! } ==Honours== Player Swansea City *FAW Premier Cup: 2004–05, 2005–06 *Football League Trophy: 2005–06 *Football League One: 2007–08 *Football League Championship play-offs: 2011 *Football League Cup: 2012–13 Individual *PFA Team of the Year: 2007–08 League One Manager Individual *Premier League Manager of the Month: August 2014 ==ReferencesExternal links== * Category:1979 births Category:Living people Category:Sportspeople from Bedford Category:English footballers Category:Association football defenders Category:Torquay United F.C. players Category:Southampton F.C. players Category:Stockport County F.C. players Category:Oxford United F.C. players Category:Sheffield Wednesday F.C. players Category:Barnsley F.C. players Category:Swansea City A.F.C. players Category:Premier League players Category:English Football League players Category:English football managers Category:Swansea City A.F.C. managers Category:Leeds United F.C. managers Category:Middlesbrough F.C. managers Category:Birmingham City F.C. managers Category:Sheffield Wednesday F.C. managers Category:Premier League managers Category:English Football League managers ","title":"Garry Monk"},{"id":"5562338","text":"When a gemstone is desired to be used in jewelry, it is cut depending on the size and shape of the rough stone, as well as the desired piece of jewelry to be made.

There are several techniques available to work with gemstones; among them are sawing, grinding, sanding, lapping, polishing, grilling, and tumbling. The diamond cut planning stage is a complex process that requires the cutter to work with unique rough stones.

Commissioned by owner Carl Benscheidt who wanted a radical structure to express the company's break from the past, the factory was designed by Walter Gropius and Adolf Meyer. It was constructed between 1911 and 1913, with additions and interiors completed in 1925. ==Influences== AEG Turbine Factory by Peter Behrens The building that had the greater influence on the design of Fagus was AEG’s Turbine factory designed by Peter Behrens. Gropius and Meyer had both worked on the project and with Fagus they presented their interpretation and criticism of their teacher’s work. The Fagus main building can be seen as an inversion of the Turbine factory. Both have corners free of supports, and glass surfaces between piers that cover the whole height of the building. However, in the Turbine factory the corners are covered by heavy elements that slant inside. The glass surfaces also slant inside and are recessed in relation to the piers. The load-bearing elements are attenuated and the building has an image of stability and monumentality. In Fagus exactly the opposite happens; the corners are left open and the piers are recessed leaving the glass surface to the front.Jaeggi (2000) pages 43-44 Gropius describes this transformation by saying, > \\"The role of the walls becomes restricted to that of mere screens stretched > between the upright columns of the framework to keep out rain, cold and > noise\\"Walter Gropius, \\"The New Architecture and the Bauhaus\\", London, 1937, > p.22-23. At the time of the design of Fagus, Gropius was collecting photographs of industrial buildings in the USA to be used for a Deutscher Werkbund publication. The design of these American factories was also a source of inspiration for Fagus. ==Construction history== Fagus owner Carl Behrens Portrait Pictures Carl Benscheidt (1858–1947) founded the Fagus company in 1910. He had then started by working for Arnold Rikkli, who practised naturopathic medicine, and it was there that he learned about orthopedic shoe lasts (which were quite rare at that time). In 1887 Benscheidt was hired by the shoe last manufacturer Carl Behrens as works manager in his factory in Alfeld. After the death of Behrens in 1896, Benscheidt became general manager of the company, which was on its way to being one of the biggest in that sector in Germany. In October 1910, he resigned from his position because of differences with Behrens's son.For more information on Carl Benscheidt see Jaeggi (2000), pages 11–17 Commission After his resignation Benscheidt immediately started his own company. He established a partnership with an American company acquiring both capital and expertise. He bought the land directly opposite Behrens's factory and hired the architect Eduard Werner (1847–1923), whom he knew from an earlier renovation of the Behrens factory. Although Werner was a specialist in factory design, Benscheidt was not pleased with the outside appearance of his design. His factory was separated from Behrens’s by a train line and Benscheidt thought of the building's elevation on that side (north) as a permanent advertisement for his factory.Jaeggi (2000) pages 89-103 are dedicated to the advertisement campaigns of Fagus and the way Gropius and other Bauhaus members were involved.Schwartz (1996) pages 187–190 contains an analysis of the Fagus building as advertisement. In January 1911 he contacted Walter Gropius and offered him the job of redesigning the facades of Werner's plan. Gropius accepted the offer and a long collaboration began that continued until 1925 when the last buildings on the site were completed. Construction During construction, Gropius and his partner Meyer were under great pressure to keep up to the rhythm of work. Construction started in May 1911 based on Werner's plans and Benscheidt wanted the factory to be running by winter of the same year. This was achieved in great part and in 1912 Gropius and Meyer were designing the interiors of the main building and secondary smaller buildings on the site. In order to pay the additional costs of Gropius’s design, Benscheidt and his American partners had decided on smaller building than the one that was actually planned. By winter 1912 it was clear that the factory could not keep up with the number of orders and a major expansion was decided. This time the contract went directly to Gropius and Meyer and, from now on, they were to be the only architects of the Fagus buildings. The expansion practically doubled the surface of the buildings by adding to the street (south) side. This gave the opportunity to create a proper street elevation. Initially the main elevation was considered the north elevation that faced the railway and Behrens's factory. Work on the expansion started in 1913 and it was barely finished when World War I broke out. During the war it was possible to do only minor works such as the power house and the chimney stack that became a prominent characteristic of the building complex. After the war the work continued with addition of minor buildings such as the porter's lodge and the enclosure wall. During that time the architects, in collaboration with teachers and students from the Bauhaus, designed the interiors and furniture of the main building. They also recommended to Benscheidt various designers for the publicity campaign of Fagus. From 1923 to 1925, the architects were also working on a new expansion, but this never took place. It was not until 1927 that Benscheidt wrote to Gropius to explain that all activities should stop until further notice due to financial difficulties. Building The building that is commonly referred to as the Fagus building is the main building. It was constructed in 1911 according to Werner's plan but with the glass facades designed by Gropius and Meyer and then expanded in 1913. The Fagus building is a 40-meter high, dark brick base that projects from the facade by 4 meters. The entrance with the clock is part of the 1913 expansion. The interiors of the building, which contained mainly offices, were finished in the mid 20s. The other two big buildings on the site are the production hall and the warehouse. Both were constructed in 1911 and expanded in 1913. The production hall is a one-storey building. It was almost invisible from the railway (north) elevation and acquired a proper facade after the expansion. The warehouse is a four-storey building with few openings. Its design followed the original plan by Werner closely, and it is left out from many of the photographs. Apart from them, the site contains various small buildings designed by Gropius and Meyer. Gropius and Meyer were able to enforce only minor changes in the overall layout of the factory complex. Overall, Werner's intended layout for the individual buildings within the complex was carried out; greater uniformity and coherence were achieved, however, through Gropius and Meyer's reductionism in form, material, and color. Construction system For many years, people thought that the main building was made of concrete or steel, because of its glass façade. However, during its renovation during the 80s, it became clear that this was not the case. Jürgen Götz, the engineer responsible for the renovation since 1982, describes the construction system like this: > \\"The main building was erected on top of a structurally stable basement with > flat caps. Nonreinforced concrete (compressed concrete), mixed with pebble > dashing was used for the basement walls, an unfortunate blend unable to > support great individual loads. From the basement upward, the building rose > in plain brickwork with reinforced wood floors. The ceilings were > underpinned with a formwork shell and finished in rough-cast plaster on the > services installation side. The floors were composed of planks on loose > sleepers – that is, sleepers that were not fixed between the floor joists. > Hence, the ceilings in the main building were not continuous shears and thus > were unable to fulfill the necessary bracing function.\\"Götz, page 134 The same kind of misunderstanding exists about the glass façade of the building that many writers describe as a curtain wall similar to the one Gropius used for the Bauhaus Dessau building. Götz describes it like this: > \\"The window openings were intrados frames composed of L beams; the internal > membering with horizontal and vertical muntins was differentiated in that > all the verticals appeared more slender on the outside, while the > horizontals appeared wider. These fames were, however, only floor-to-floor > height, screwed to the building on four sides; one string course that > reached across the three floors consisted, in fact, of three different > sections. Along the side of the building, 3-millimetre-thick steel plates > sealed the wedge between window frame and piers.\\"Götz, page 135 This description applies only to the main building. Götz note that the other buildings were much simpler and some of them were actually concrete and/or steel constructions. Design Although constructed with different systems, all of the buildings on the site give a common image and appear as a unified whole. The architects achieved this by the use of some common elements in all the buildings. The first one is the use of floor-to-ceiling glass windows on steel frames that go around the corners of the buildings without a visible (most of the time without any) structural support. The other unifying element is the use of brick. All buildings have a base of about 40 cm of black brick and the rest is built of yellow bricks. The combined effect is a feeling of lightness or as Gropius called it \\"etherealization\\". In order to enhance this feeling of lightness, Gropius and Meyer used a series of optical refinements like greater horizontal than vertical elements on the windows, longer windows on the corners and taller windows on the last floor. The design of the building was oriented to the railroad side. Benscheidt considered that the point of view of the passengers on the trains was the one that determined the image of the building and placed great weight on the facade on that side. It was already noted by Peter Behrens (with whom Gropius and Meyer were working one year before starting work on the Fagus factory) that architects should take account of the way the speed of modern transportation affects the way architecture is perceived. Gropius had also commented the subject in his writings. According to the historian of architecture Annemarie Jaeggi these thoughts were important in the design of Fagus: > \\"The animated fluctuation in height, the change between horizontal structure > and vertical rhythms, heavy closed volumes and light dissolved fabrics, are > indicators of an approach that deliberately utilized contrasts while > arriving at a harmony of opposites in a manner best expressed as a pictorial > or visual structure created from the perspective of the railroad > tracks.\\"Jaeggi (2000) page 38 == Gallery == Image:Fagus-Werke-01.jpg Image:Fagus-Werke-02.jpg Image:Fagus- Werke-03.jpg ==NotesReferences== * Götz, Jürgen. \\"Maintaining Fagus\\", in Jaeggi (2000) pages 133-141 * Jaeggi, Annemarie (2000).

The school was founded in 1870 and is located today in Northwood, London, England. ==History== Northwood College for Girls is an independent day school for girls aged 3 to 18 and located in Northwood, London, England. The school was originally located in Regent Square in 1870, although little is known about this era. In 1878 the school moved to Endsleigh Gardens in Eaton Square, and its Headmistress was Miss Buchan-Smith. At this time the school had between 20-30 boarders and a few day girls and boys in the nursery. Although the priorities of education in the later nineteenth differed to the ambitions that exist today, there were some similarities, with Miss Buchan-Smith wanting her girls to be well educated with interests beyond the classroom. In 1892 the school moved out of central London to Northwood (in 1871 the area was described as \\"a destitute district near Moor Park\\"), where a railway station had opened five years earlier helping make Northwood, about 25 minutes from central London, more desirable. Many of the area's roads were named after the Carew landowner family, including Maxwell Road. Development of the area aimed to attract affluent residents, with houses selling in Maxwell Road for £750 to £1,300, making it one of the wealthiest in the neighbourhood. In 1893 the School reopened in Northwood with 20 boarders and 2 day girls; The Briary was also acquired for little boys. Over the next 15 years further land was acquired which included the playing fields. In 1899 the school built a gymnasium, which was also used as an Assembly Hall. Whilst in 1907 with more accommodation needed the Briary boys moved to Duck Hill and their building was extended and became a Junior School House. In 1911 the Dining Hall was built and the founder of the School, Miss Buchan-Smith Retired. Miss Hay became Headmistress, but only for two years, and in 1913 Miss Agnes White became Headmistress, remaining in this post for 17 years. Miss White oversaw a period of growth in the School, with pupil numbers increasing from 71 students in 1914 to 147 students in 1922. There was also a shift with the number of day girls exceeding the number of boarders. Miss White was succeeded by Miss Potts, who was Headmistress from 1930-38. But the next stage of growth for the school was overseen by Miss Worger, who was Headmistress for 28 years. Miss Worger aimed to increase student numbers to 500, and to enable this to happen 10 new classrooms were needed immediately, as well as a new hall, science labs and art and craft rooms. The building of the Manor started in 1962; this meant the school was able to accommodate 400 students by 1963. The Upper School building was originally constructed in 1979 as the Junior School, only changing its function in 1996. The pavilion that contains the Textiles and Home economic rooms are also a recent addition being constructed in 1999. A sports hall and pool were developed in 1991, on the site of an outdoor pool built in 1949. The original gymnasium is now the Centenary Library. Music and performing arts facilities moved from Wray Lodge (now used by administrative staff) to a purpose-built performing arts centre in 2005, and in 2009 an Early Years Centre (now called Bluebelle House) was opened. In 2009, Miss Pain became Headmistress and in 2014, the school merged with Heathfield School, Pinner and simultaneously became a member of the Girls' Day School Trust, with the name 'Northwood College GDST'. Miss Pain retired in 2018 and the then Head of Junior School, Mrs Hubble, became Headmistress. In 2019, the refurbished Centenary Library was opened and the Swimming Pool renovated as part of a £1.8m project in modernisation of the Sports Centre. Mrs Hubble has now unveiled plans for a new Science and Sixth Form building. ==Head Mistresses== 1878 – 1911 Miss Buchan Smith 1911 – 1913 Miss Hay 1913 – 1930 Miss White 1930 – 1938 Miss Potts 1938 – 1966 Miss Worger 1967 - 1986 Miss Hillyer-Cole 1986 – 1991 Mrs Dalton 1991 - 2002 Mrs Mayou 2002 - 2008 Mrs Mercer 2009 – 2018 Miss Pain 2018 Mrs Hubble ==House system== Northwood College has four houses.

It is produced by Nickelodeon Latin America and Macias Group International. The show first aired on 15 May 2006, and ran at 8:00 pm for the first two seasons. In the third season of the show, it was moved to 6:00 pm on Mondays. For the 2007 summer- fall transition, the show aired reruns weekdays at 7:00 pm; also, during the 2006 summer-fall transition, the show aired reruns on Mondays at 6:00pm; during the 2007 break between seasons 2 and 3, the show aired reruns of 3 episodes on Mondays at 6:00 pm as well. From 2010 to 2013, it aired reruns on Nick at Nite block on Nickelodeon Latin America. The opening song for the show, \\"Skimo Es el Lugar\\" (\\"Skimo Is the Place\\"), is performed by the pop rock band Motel. ==Overview of the show== Skimo is the story of two boys, Fito and Tavo, who made their dreams reality by opening their own shop. Skimo is described as \\"the coolest place in the neighbourhood\\". As an eatery, Skimo sells many innovative flavoured foods, like strawberry milkshakes, mango on a stick with chamoy sauce, or the vanilla ice-cream stuffed pepper. ==EpisodesCharacters== Fito (Daniel Tovar) Fito is the typical \\"cool guy\\" co- protagonist in the series. He does not earn good grades in school, but he is athletic and portrays himself as \\"the coolest dude in the neighborhood\\" almost everywhere and always has odd ideas to improve Skimo (like selling one Skimo at twice its price, instead of selling 2X1). He likes rock, hip-hop, and beatbox music and he has an \\"internal beat\\" when he is speaking or doing something. He's a dreamer and a schemer, and he talks about his fantasies as if they were real. Fito is 16 years old. His most notorious feature is his surfer-afro hair, and his skateboard-style clothes. Tavo Nachón (Miguel Santa Rita) Tavo is Fito's best friend, although they call themselves business partners. He is the smart co-protagonist in the series, and his intelligence is fundamental for Skimo's success. He has a secret crush on Úrsula. He is very timid, and also considered a \\"geek\\" due to his obsession with order, control and extreme cleanliness. He uses better or different words than Fito because he is smarter. In the first episode is revealed that Tavo's last name is \\"Nachon\\". Just like all of the friends, Tavo is the opposite of Fito, and maybe that's the reason that they are friends. He wears casual clothes, and he hates all kinds of sickness. Tavo is 17 years old. By the end of season 2 his parents get divorced and he has to go live in another state and this ends season 2. In season 3 he spends a lot of time with his new girlfriend, Cris, who makes Ursula very jealous; however, it is hinted that maybe he is still in love with Ursula. Tavo's name was probably inspired by the Spanish word \\"bonachón\\", which translated means \\"goody\\". Don Filemón (Pedro Romo) Don Filemón was the owner of the pizzeria that once occupied the site that Skimo now occupies. Fito and Tavo decided to rent the whole place from him to make Skimo. Don Filemón is the classical lifelong storyteller, and always speaks about his world travels, or his travelling family; no one believes these stories. Fátima (Claudia Bollat) Fatima is the portly, expert cook in Skimo. She makes all dishes and meals and helps in a lot of things. She is a very dreamy person who likes to know how much she is needed. She sometimes experiments by combining two different recipes, making the dishes that Skimo is noted for. When the order is done she shouts very loud \\"Sale un (order) para la mesa (number of the table)\\" which is Spanish for \\"Ready some... (order)... for the table number...(number of the table)\\" until the grade of a deafening. She also has an alter-ego known as Super Fat, a renowned Lucha Libre wrestler. The reason she became a wrestler was to get revenge against her ex-boyfriend Nitro because he refused to drink one of her strawberry milkshakes. However, it is later proved that Nitro is actually allergic to strawberry, so they solve their misunderstanding and go back together. Nora and Nori (Alejandra and Avelina Vazquez) Nora and Nori are 16-years old and are the typical antagonists in the show. They are very showoffy, irritating, selfish, and annoying. They always want to lead Skimo to bankruptcy, and also try to complicate everything in Fito and Tavo's life. They always refer to one another as twinie, and they shout out \\"twin power\\" anytime they have an idea or plot. Also, anytime Nora and Nori hear something outrageous they shout \\"Oh Please\\". Everyone in the show mistakes one for the other. Úrsula (Tatiana Martinez) She is the \\"I-always-do-the-right- thing\\" girl, and she is a very good friend of Fito and Tavo, but she ignores the fact that Tavo has a crush on her.

In the last episode of the show, Ursula leaves high school and accepts Tavo's proposal to have a romantic relationship. Shi (Paul Cortinas) He is a very good example of a videogame addict. He was included in a very expensive arcade machine that Fito bought \\"because it has 3-D Graphics and it was very cheap\\". He is always playing at the arcade machine, and the little times he leaves the machine, he plays handheld videogames. He never allows anyone to touch the arcade when he is playing, excepting for Shila. In one episode, he receives a trophy for being the country's best gamer. Nobody really knows who this 12-year-old boy is. At the beginning it was thought that Shi was speechless, but in the last episode is revealed that he speaks. Mucho Mucho (Oswaldo Ibarra) He is the classic jack-of-all-trades, and helps supplying Skimo. He likes to say his name a lot and talks very quickly. He is also seen doing another jobs, like those of policeman, plumber, doctor, surgeon, etc. He always has every needed thing in his almost infinite Hammerspace bag. His name might translate as \\"A lot A lot\\" or \\"Very Very\\". ==Other characters== Salvador He's a poor little boy whom Tavo gave the Christmas Star (that goes on top of the Christmas tree) in the (Christmas'Two-part episode).

Nicole Nicole is a French teenager who goes to Fito and Tavo's school. Fito immediately had a crush on her when she arrived so he decided to use his low average in French class to get tutoring from her. Nicole only appeared in the episode 'French 101'. Fulvio Fulvio \\"Caradura\\" is an antagonist to Fito. He has a skater band and is considered a \\"tough guy\\" in the neighbourhood. He appeared in the very first episode in a brief cameo, but his debut appearance was later in the episode Hang Em' High\\".

At the end of the episode \\"Boys Will be Girls\\", Tavo was dressed like a girl and Fulvio fell in love with \\"her\\".

She faked to have a crush on Fito although she doesn't receive the same feelings from Fito. Heicker Heicker is Tavo's brother. He is a little bit of a distracted guy but with many girlfriends. At the end of the episode \\"Oh Brother!', he saves Tavo from an explosion in one of his magic tricks. Heicker thinks Tavo likes him but Tavo is always jealous of him. Tato He appears briefly during the episode \\"Goodbye Tavo\\". He became Fito's new best friend and partner, but got fired for having a crush on Nora and Nori.

Waleran III (or Walram III) ( – 2 July 1226) was initially lord of Montjoie, then count of Luxembourg from 1214. He became count of Arlon and duke of Limburg on his father's death in 1221. He was the son of Henry III of Limburg and Sophia of Saarbrücken. As a younger son, he did not expect to inherit. He carried on an adventurous youth and took part in the Third Crusade in 1192. In 1208, the imperial candidate Philip of Swabia died and Waleran, his erstwhile supporter, turned to his opponent, Otto of Brunswick. In 1212, he accompanied his first cousin Henry I, Duke of Brabant, to Liège, then in a war with Guelders. Waleran's first wife, Cunigunda, a daughter of Frederick I, Duke of Lorraine, died in 1214 and in May he married Ermesinda of Luxembourg, and became count there. Ermesinda claimed Namur and so Waleran added a crown to his coat of arms to symbolise this claim. In 1221, he inherited Limburg and added a second tail to the rampant lion on his arms. This symbolised his holding of two great fiefs. In 1223, he again tried to take Namur from the Margrave Philip II. He failed and signed a peace treaty on 13 February in Dinant. He then took part in various imperial diets and accompanied the Emperor Frederick II into Italy. Returning from there, he died in Rolduc. ==Family and children== Waleran had four children by his first wife, Cunigunda of Lorraine, daughter of Frederick I, Duke of Lorraine, and three children by his second wife, Ermesinda of Luxembourg.

With monsoon repeatedly failing, his village reels under drought, and he runs from pillar to post to get a well dug in the village. He manages to bring Shanmugham (Mahadevan), a water- divining expert, to dig a well. Shanmugham, his wife, and daughter Marikozhundhu (Pooja) come to the village. Unfortunately, a freak mishap kills Shanmugham, and the villagers' search for water continues. To eke out their livelihood, all the villagers, led by Kadhirvel, decide to leave the village with a heavy heart to take up employment in a farmhouse in Rajasthan. Upon reaching the place, they come to know they have been taken as bonded laborers, and there is no way out but to work there tirelessly for the next three years. They undergo physical and mental torture from the greedy landlord Thakur Dass (Vincent Asokan). A silver lining in the cloud is Swapna (Namitha), Thakur's sister. She gets fascinated by Kadhirvel's heroics. The rest is how Kadhirvel fights for his men, helps them reach their village back without any danger and eventually marries Marikozhundhu. ==Cast== *Prashanth as Kathirvel *Pooja as Marikozhundhu *Namitha as Swapna *Vincent Asokan as Thakur Dass *Mahadevan as Shanmugam *Karunas *Thambi Ramaiah *Besant Ravi ==Production== The film was launched in July 2005 by Amudha Durairaj and her production house Deivanai Movies, who had previously made Thamizh (2002) with Prashanth in the lead role.

Radiopuhelimet is a Finnish alternative rock band formed in Oulu in 1986. Their style, though varied through the years, could be described as a combination of hardcore punk, noise rock and progressive rock. Besides from performing as a band in a regular sense, they are also known for having contributed in theatre from time to time. ==Early history== From autumn 1983 to March 1986 Jarno Mällinen (guitar) and Jyrki Raatikainen (drums) played in Kansanturvamusiikkikomissio together with Antti Penttilä (vocals), Pekka Salonsaari (r.i.p.) (bass) and, from summer 1985 onwards, Jukka Kangas (guitar). Kansanturvamusiikkikomissio (or KTMK for short) disbanded after their last show on the first of March 1986. A couple of weeks later Mällinen, Raatikainen and Kangas formed a new band called Radiopuhelimet (The Radiophones) and promptly asked a friend who was known to be loud, Jyrki Mäki from band Ei!Ei! (No!No!), to join them as a singer. During autumn 1987 Raatikainen, Antti Penttilä and Kari Heikonen founded a record company called Bad Vugum with the intention of publishing music by Radiopuhelimet. The band immediately recorded eight songs which were released as two 7\\" EP's: Sinappia ja ketsuppia (\\"Mustard and ketchup\\"), released right before Christmas in 1987 and Tyhjä on täysi (\\"Empty is full\\") in spring 1988. The recordings brought Radiopuhelimet to the attention of record company Euros and a deal for two full-length albums was signed. The first album, Rokkiräjähdys (\\"Rock explosion\\") was recorded during the early weeks of autumn 1988 and was released a couple of months later. The reviews were mostly positive. Rehearsals of new material had been underway for some time when bass player Hautamäki announced he was leaving to study in Helsinki. He played some shows but three of them were still performed with a four-man line-up: Kangas had got the thumb of his right arm severely mutilated at sausage factory but he fortunately recovered fairly quickly. This five-man line-up played its final show in Tampere in August 1989. Hautamäki settled in Helsinki and Kangas returned to bass-playing. The next album, K.O., recorded in October 1989 was recorded with a four-man line-up (Kangas also plays second guitar on the record). Meanwhile the record company had changed to Spirit, a sublabel of Sonet, piloted by Riku Mattila. Euros was no longer interested in Radiopuhelimet, probably because sales were not what the company had expected and because the band refused to sign publishing contracts. Euros gave the band willingly away to Spirit. Mattila also recorded and produced the album. The final sound mix was done by Mikko Karmila (but went uncredited). Right on the eve of the K.O. recording sessions Radiopuhelimet played their first shows abroad in Leningrad (now St. Petersburg). The venues were a small youth club somewhere in the suburbs with a small but enthusiastic audience and a grandiose youth palace where most of the audience walked out. Paska (\\"Shit\\") from Helsinki was also performing on the gigs. At the end of 1989 a new bass player Eero Korhonen joined the band and was injured in a traffic accident right away: his vicissitudes with the band started with a two-week hospital period. K.O. was published in February 1990. The album was received with enthusiasm and the band got to play more shows than before. Hannu Korhonen had replaced Jussi Alavuotunki (r.i.p.) as the promoter. Later on Korhonen was employed by an agency called Dex-Viihde (\\"Dex Entertainment\\") and Radiopuhelimet went with him. During the summer of 1990 the band performed in Ruisrock, Dinosaurock, Suviyön sumutus and Nummirock. ==1990-2000== Recording sessions for a new album started in September 1990 in an old factory building on Pikisaari island in Oulu. Riku Mattila was again recording and producing it. After a couple of shows played after the recording sessions the band went on a half-year break while Raatikainen travelled around the world (literally). The new album, entitled Pian, pian (\\"Soon, soon\\"), was published when Raatikainen returned in spring 1991. Although it received a mostly positive response from the papers there was some dissatisfaction especially on the part of the audience. Shows were nevertheless successful,even though there were no gigs on big festivals in the summer. A new album, Jäämeri (\\"The Arctic Sea\\") was recorded in January 1992. The sessions were much more meticulous and diligent in comparison with earlier recording sessions. This was caused not only by the desire to improve from the previous album but also by the fact that Mikko Karmila was assisting Riku Mattila in producing and recording the album. In February Radiopuhelimet left for their first longer tour abroad together with CMX. Almost 20 shows were played in a five weeks' time in Germany, Austria, Italy and Denmark. The reception was very good and there was spare time for tourism as well. Jäämeri was released in April '92 to a somewhat confused audience. Many people didn't know how to react to the music which had slowed down and gained a \\"jerky\\" quality: the album was \\"interesting\\" but \\"difficult\\". It did, however, find understanding among friends of jazz/ avantgarde, even to the extent that some people still consider it to be the best recording the band has ever made. The band and bass player Korhonen parted ways in December 1993 due to his other commitments which made touring and intense rehearsing impossible. Antti Annunen, known from Mieskuoro Huutajat (Men's Choir Shouters) joined the band as a new bass player and was ran in with a month of rehearsals right away: the band was leaving on a new European tour at the beginning of 1994, this time by themselves. The initial plan was to have Annunen as a bass player only for the tour and return to a four-man line-up again, but things worked out so well that the final show of the tour in the Seamen's Mission in Hamburg was not his last show with the band after all: he became a regular member of the band. The tour lasted for five weeks and included shows in Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Germany, Hungary and the Czech Republic. The summer was spent playing shows at Finnish festivals. At the end of the year there was a two-week tour of Scandinavia. Guitar player Kangas could not join the tour due to work commitments and family reasons. Ismo Autioniemi from Electric Blue Peggy Sue and the Revolutionions From Mars played guitar at the tour. At the beginning of 1990 the band returned to Bad Vugum. Sonet/Spirit had by the time of Jäämeri album become a part of multinational PolyGram entertainment corporation. Profit was to be made and \\"hobbyists\\" like Electric Blue Peggy Sue and Radiopuhelimet which brought little money home were no longer needed. Moreover, Riku Mattila had left Polygram as well and no one else in the company seemed to be interested in the band. There had been plans for moving to another label in the air already. They were mostly caused by the increasingly indifferent and inflexible attitude on the part of Polygram. Especially getting release rights for a couple of songs to be included on an Alternative Tentacles compilation EP called \\"Hygiene\\" was difficult. At the beginning of 1996 guitar player Kangas left the band due to work commitments and family reasons. The second guitarist Mällinen immediately phoned Ray Katz, the singer-guitar player from Electric Blue Peggy Sue, who was living in Berlin at the time. Mällinen asked him to join the band as a new guitar player. Katz asked for a week or two to think about it but phoned back in ten minutes accepting the proposal. Among the festival shows of summer 1998 a special set of old Kansanturvamusiikkikomissio songs was played in Läsnärock with a four-man line-up (without Katz). The KTMK set was performed also in Oulu in December. Hiljaista!, mixed by Mikko Karmila, was released in September. It received mostly positive comments but also caused some surprise because of its slow and \\"airy\\" quality formerly quite uncharacteristic of the band. Theatre director Juha Hurme, who the band had got to know while working on Kostamus-symphony, had already in summer '97 suggested a play to be produced in collaboration. The project started in spring 1998 with group discussions and interviews of various band members made by Hurme. Constructing and rehearsing the script went on little by little until the play, called simply \\"Radiopuhelimet\\", premiered at the Oulu Children's Theatre Festival in February 2000. During the rest of the year the play was performed around Finland in connection with ordinary gigs. The reception was excellent everywhere: the audience seemed to like the play more than the music itself. A good example of this was one fan letter addressed \\"to a band I don't like\\". A new album, Oulu on kaupungin nimi (Oulu is the name of a city) was recorded in December 1999. Riku Mattila and Pentti Dassum worked at the studio again and Mikko Karmila mixed the album. The album was released in April 2000 and marks a return to the more noisy and upbeat songs of the early albums. It received the best reviews since Maasäteilyä. ==2000-onwards== The band has kept on playing gigs and changing from various small labels from one to another. The marginal amount of critical success they might have had has been at times even more marginal, but the band has kept on playing shows and recording new albums to this date. Their album \\"Ei kenenkään maa\\" (\\"Nobodys land\\") was made acoustic, but was considered by the record distribution company Levykauppaäx on their website to be \\"as noisy and threatening as all their electrical records\\". == Members == * Jyrki (J.A.)

It has 240 stores throughout New Zealand, mostly in small towns. Some Four Square supermarkets also operated in Australia. ==History== Emergence Four Square emerged as a household name in the 1920s out of the Foodstuffs grocery buying co-operative, whose founder, John Heaton Barker, became concerned at the manner in which the activities of the grocery chain stores of the day were making life difficult for independent grocers in Auckland. On 6 July 1922, Heaton Barker called together members of the Auckland Master Grocers Association and discussed their plans for forming a cooperative buying group of independent grocers. On 1 April 1925, this buying group registered a company called Foodstuffs Ltd, which was the first of three regional cooperatives based in Auckland, Wellington and Christchurch. Name The name Four Square emerged when Heaton Barker, while talking on the telephone to one of the buying group members on 4 July 1924, drew a square around the 4 of the date on his calendar. He considered this to be a suitable name for the buying group, stating that \\"they would stand ’Four Square’ to all the winds that blew\\". Branding By the end of 1924 products were appearing under the Four Square name, and by 1929 discussions were underway on the use of a common branding on stores. Early versions of the Four Square sign were produced in the form of red and gold hand painted glass panels for display in members’ stores. The \\"Mr 4 Square\\" symbol, also known as \\"Cheeky Charlie\\", was developed in the 1950s. The image is associated with the art of New Zealand artist Dick Frizzell, who has used the iconic character in many of his works. Store format In February 1948, in Onehunga, Phil Barker (the son of the founder of the group) and Ray McGregor opened Four Square's – and the country's – first self-service grocery store (where shoppers take groceries off the shelf, rather than an attendant doing it for them), and this format soon became the norm for grocery retailing in New Zealand. ==ReferencesExternal links== * Four Square website Category:1924 establishments in New Zealand Category:Companies based in Auckland Category:Food and drink companies established in 1924 Category:Retail companies established in 1924 Category:Supermarkets of New Zealand Category:New Zealand companies established in 1924 ","title":"Four Square (supermarket)"},{"id":"5562592","text":"Reynaldo S. \\"Rey\\" Galang is a Filipino martial arts teacher and author. He is one of the chief founders and head instructors of Bakbakan International. == History and experience == Rey Galang was born in Manila. Losing his father at an early age, his uncles contributed greatly to his interest in the Martial Arts. His family had a history of career military and police officers. He was a student of the late Antonio Ilustrisimo, and he is the official designated heir of the knife fighting aspect of Kalis Ilustrisimo (which he has developed into a present-day form called \\"Tulisan\\"). He holds ranks in the arts of karate, Jujutsu, judo and aikido. == Notoriety == Along with Christopher \\"Topher\\" Ricketts, Rey Galang was the founder and driving force behind the Bakbakan organization or \\"Fraternal Brotherhood\\" of Filipino Martial Artists. In 1986, Rey formed a project called \\"Masters of Arnis\\" which featured Rey Galang, Christopher Ricketts, Antonio Diego and Edgar Sulite on an instructional tour of Sydney and Melbourne, Australia. This gave Rey and Bakbakan international exposure and triggered several articles in mainstream martial arts magazines. Since then, he has written four Martial Arts books and numerous magazine articles. == Lameco influence == The late Punong-Guro Edgar Sulite sought Master Rey's support and advice in developing the final structure of the Lameco Eskrima organization. Rey assisted with the setup of ranking structure and instructor certifications, and he designed and edited Lameco's newsletter \\"Vortex\\".

It is used in the representation theory of SL(2,R) and in analytic number theory. It is closely related to the Epstein zeta function. There are many generalizations associated to more complicated groups. ==Definition== The Eisenstein series E(z, s) for z = x + iy in the upper half-plane is defined by :E(z,s) ={1\\\\over 2}\\\\sum_{(m,n)=1}{y^s\\\\overmz+n^{2s}} for Re(s) > 1, and by analytic continuation for other values of the complex number s. The sum is over all pairs of coprime integers. Warning: there are several other slightly different definitions. Some authors omit the factor of ½, and some sum over all pairs of integers that are not both zero; which changes the function by a factor of ζ(2s). ==Properties== As a function on z Viewed as a function of z, E(z,s) is a real-analytic eigenfunction of the Laplace operator on H with the eigenvalue s(s-1). In other words, it satisfies the elliptic partial differential equation : \\\\- y^2\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2}{\\\\partial x^2}+\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2}{\\\\partial y^2}\\\\right)E(z,s) = s(1-s)E(z,s), where z=x+yi. The function E(z, s) is invariant under the action of SL(2,Z) on z in the upper half plane by fractional linear transformations. Together with the previous property, this means that the Eisenstein series is a Maass form, a real-analytic analogue of a classical elliptic modular function. Warning: E(z, s) is not a square-integrable function of z with respect to the invariant Riemannian metric on H. As a function on s The Eisenstein series converges for Re(s)>1, but can be analytically continued to a meromorphic function of s on the entire complex plane, with in the half-plane Re(s) \\\\geq 1/2 a unique pole of residue 3/π at s = 1 (for all z in H) and infinitely many poles in the strip 0 < Re(s) < 1/2 at \\\\rho / 2 where \\\\rho corresponds to a non-trivial zero of the Riemann zeta-function. The constant term of the pole at s = 1 is described by the Kronecker limit formula. The modified function : E^*(z,s) = \\\\pi^{-s}\\\\Gamma(s)\\\\zeta(2s)E(z,s)\\\\ satisfies the functional equation :E^*(z,s) = E^*(z,1-s)\\\\ analogous to the functional equation for the Riemann zeta function ζ(s). Scalar product of two different Eisenstein series E(z, s) and E(z, t) is given by the Maass-Selberg relations.  Fourier expansion  The above properties of the real analytic Eisenstein series, i.e. the functional equation for E(z,s) and E*(z,s) using Laplacian on H, are shown from the fact that E(z,s) has a Fourier expansion: E(z,s)=y^s+ \\\\frac{\\\\hat\\\\zeta(2s-1)}{\\\\hat{\\\\zeta}(2s)} y^{1-s} +\\\\frac{4}{\\\\hat{\\\\zeta}(2s)}\\\\sum_{m=1}^\\\\infty m^{s-1/2}\\\\sigma_{1-2s}(m)\\\\sqrt{y}K_{s-1/2}(2\\\\pi my)\\\\cos(2\\\\pi mx)\\\\ , where :\\\\hat{\\\\zeta}(s)=\\\\pi^{-s/2}\\\\Gamma\\\\biggl(\\\\frac{s}{2}\\\\biggr)\\\\zeta(s)\\\\ , :\\\\sigma_s(m)=\\\\sum_{dm}d^s\\\\ , and modified Bessel functions :\\\\begin{align}K_s(z) &=\\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\int^\\\\infty_0\\\\exp\\\\biggl(-\\\\frac{z}{2}(u+\\\\frac{1}{u})\\\\biggr)\\\\cdot u^{s-1}du \\\\\\\\\\\\ &\\\\sim\\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{\\\\pi}{2z}}e^{-z}\\\\ .\\\\ \\\\ \\\\ \\\\ \\\\ \\\\ \\\\ \\\\ \\\\ (z\\\\rightarrow\\\\infty)\\\\end{align} ==Epstein zeta function== The Epstein zeta function ζQ(s) for a positive definite integral quadratic form Q(m, n) = cm2 \\\\+ bmn +an2 is defined by : \\\\zeta_Q(s) = \\\\sum_{(m,n) e (0,0)} {1\\\\over Q(m,n)^s}.\\\\ It is essentially a special case of the real analytic Eisenstein series for a special value of z, since : Q(m,n) = amz-n^2\\\\ for : z = -\\\\frac{b}{2a} + \\\\frac{i\\\\sqrt{-b^2+4ac}}{2a}. This zeta function was named after Paul Epstein. ==Generalizations== The real analytic Eisenstein series E(z, s) is really the Eisenstein series associated to the discrete subgroup SL(2,Z) of SL(2,R). Selberg described generalizations to other discrete subgroups Γ of SL(2,R), and used these to study the representation of SL(2,R) on L2(SL(2,R)/Γ). Langlands extended Selberg's work to higher dimensional groups; his notoriously difficult proofs were later simplified by Joseph Bernstein. ==See also== *Eisenstein series *Kronecker limit formula *Maass form ==References== *J.

In this version of the character, she is the half-faerie half-sister of the mythic King Arthur. Her elven heritage granted her immortality, and she used this time to master the mystic arts. She occasionally tries to take over the world. She has been an opponent of The Avengers, and in the 1970s, she appeared in the original Spider-Woman comic acting as a foe of Jessica Drew, and was opposed by a reincarnation of her \\"ancient foe\\" Magnus. She is a former lover of Doctor Doom, and was a member of the Darkholders for a time. The character was portrayed by Jessica Walter in the 1978 television film Dr. Strange. Elizabeth Hurley portrayed the character in the third season of the Marvel Cinematic Universe television series Runaways. ==Publication history== Morgan le Fay first appeared in Atlas Comics in Black Knight #1 (May 1955), written by Stan Lee and illustrated by Joe Maneely. After the Black Knight series ended in 1956, she was eventually reintroduced into Marvel Comics in Spider- Woman #2 (May 1978). ==Fictional character biography== Medieval times Morgan Le Fay was born in Tintagel Castle, in Cornwall, England, in the days of Camelot, in the Sixth Century A.D. She became a high priestess, and the leader of the Sixth Century cult of the Darkhold, as well as Queen of Gorre (a section of Britain). She and the rest of the cult used the Darkhold to summon its author Chthon. When they found they could not control him, they sealed the dark god away in Wundagore Mountain.Avengers #187. Marvel Comics. By this time - convinced that Morgan was thoroughly corrupted by evil - her apprentice and lover Magnus the Sorcerer stole the Darkhold from her.Avengers #241. Marvel Comics. She, along with her lover, Mordred, was a nemesis for the original Black Knight. During this time, Morgan Le Fay was visited by a supervillain from the future named Doctor Doom to enlist her in helping wrest his mother Cynthia Von Doom's soul from Hell. Le Fay agreed on the condition that Doom become the general of her army, undead warriors of those slain by the sword Excalibur against her half-brother King Arthur. Iron Man defeated Le Fay causing her to flee to another realm. Doom swore vengeance on Iron Man for this, vowing to see the hero dead.Iron Man #150. Marvel Comics.

Avengers assemble again Using the monsters of Norse mythology, she and Mordred lured the Scarlet Witch (and a team of Avengers) to Tintagel in Cornwall. There, she kidnapped the Scarlet Witch and used her reality-warping powers to 'bridge the gap' between her elven magic and an Asgardian doomsday device known as the Twilight Sword.Avengers Vol 3 #1. Marvel Comics. Using the Sword, she remade reality: the world was now a Middle Ages equivalent of itself, except that she ruled the world, and had done so for some time.Avengers Vol 3 #2. Marvel Comics. However, the Avengers stepped in and freed the Scarlet Witch, thus negating the original spell the others were based on, and restoring reality.Avengers Vol 3 #3. Marvel Comics.

Le Fay has told Doom to bring her back something \\"of value\\" as a gift the next time he comes to her time or not to come back at all. He later returns, asking for her help in creating an army of loyal inhuman warriors. She asks what she gets in return, to which Doom asks her what she wants, to which her response is currently unknown as Doom reappears in the present with his army of Mindless Ones. Later, Le Fay is seen sadly looking out her window for the return of Doom, who has been defeated and incarcerated by the Mighty Avengers.Mighty Avengers #9. Marvel Comics.

She and her demons are seen fighting the Dark Avengers, while Doom and Iron Patriot travel back in time to kill her in her own time.Dark Avengers #3. Marvel Comics. However, when they arrive, after an unsuccessful magical assault on the two men (due to the considerable amount of iron in their armor suits, the one substance her faerie enchantments cannot affect), she reveals to Osborn her knowledge that Doom plans to betray her and that if they kill her, it will affect Doom's own lifeline, claiming Doom will fall to his nature and betray Osborn; Doom responds by chanting a spell of a language that even she possesses no knowledge to forcibly send the sorceress into her own enchanted cauldron, despite her screams and pleas. Though Morgan lives, she is sent to 1,000,000 BC where she runs from a tribe of cavemen fighting a Tyrannosaurus. Doctor Doom magically restores Latveria and the revived Dark Avengers head back to America.Dark Avengers #4. Marvel Comics.

The Avengers and the Euroforce proceeded to beat her up, forcing her to retreat.Avengers World #14. Marvel Comics. Queen of Otherworld Morgan le Fay later resurfaced and planned to conquer Camelot on Otherworld but when the flowers of Krakoa reach Otherworld to form a Gateway to Krakoa, it infected Camelot, causing le Fay to find a way to destroy it. In order to achieve this, she needed to terminate the \\"Witchbreed\\", who were responsible for this. After Brian Braddock and his twin sister, Betsy Braddock came to fix the Gateway, le Fay apprehended them and took control of Brian, making him to turn on his sister. However, he managed to give to Betsy his amulet, which allowed her to escape. Excalibur vol. 4 #1. Marvel Comics. Morgan then allied with the Coven Akkaba in order to deal with the Witchbreeds.Excalibur vol. 4 #3. Marvel Comics. ==Powers and abilities== Morgan le Fay possesses a natural affinity for magical forces which is a result of her half-faerie genetic structure. She possesses a gifted intellect, and as a former pupil of Merlin with centuries of study, she is considered one of the greatest sorceresses in Earth's history. Her magical powers are derived from three major sources. Due to her faerie heritage she possesses innate personal powers such as the ability to control minds. She also has the faerie ability to manipulate mystical energy, often through spells and enchantments of ancient Celtic origin, an ability she has honed through practice. She also possesses abilities all humans potentially have, such as the ability to engage in astral projection. Finally, she has abilities as a high priestess of the Earth goddess (Gaea) by invoking her Celtic name, Danu. Morgan can mystically manipulate both the natural environment of Earth and the environment of the astral plane in which she once existed. She can cast illusions, project mystical bolts (which can affect physical beings and objects even when she is in astral form), create mystical force shields and remove spirits from their bodies and place those spirits under her control. When in physical form, she can fly and change her shape into other people or animals (both real and mythical). She also has healing powers which she might have used on her former foe King Arthur on transporting him to Otherworld. Morgan can also tap into and manipulate powerful magical energies for powerful feats of magic without having to tax upon her normal magical abilities, such as when she used the power of the Norn Stones and the Twilight Sword to restructure reality (although she needed the Scarlet Witch to bridge her Faerie heritage to the Asgardian magic).Avengers vol. 3 #1-3 (1997). Marvel Comics. Morgan has utilized the Crimson Bands of Cyttorak to bind Doctor Strange and Balor. She is also able to time travel. Morgan is virtually immortal. Her spirit has restored her physical body at the various times it has been destroyed. Due to her hybrid nature (half-human and half- faerie), Morgan le Fay has the faerie's vulnerability to \\"cold iron\\" or steel. These materials can cause her harm both in her physical and astral form. In New Avengers #53, the Eye of Agamotto appeared to Morgan, as it considered her a possible replacement for Doctor Strange as Sorcerer Supreme. ==Other versions== Age of Ultron During the Age of Ultron storyline, Wolverine and Invisible Woman's plans to kill Hank Pym to prevent the creation of Ultron caused an alternate reality in which Morgan le Fay had conquered half the world following a war between Asgard and Latveria and magic has overcome technology. Morgan le Fay later attacks with a swarm of magically-powered Doombots. The Defenders fight them with Iron Man controlling hundreds of drones and accusing Morgan le Fay of having sent the time travelers back in time. She claims innocence and then points out to Iron Man how a pair of Helicarriers are crashing into the heart of New York City.Age of Ultron #8 Weirdworld version During the \\"Secret Wars\\" storyline, a variation of Morgan le Fay from Earth-15238 was salvaged by God Emperor Doom and made the baroness of the Battleworld domain of Weirdworld under the alias of Witch Queen le Fay. She is served by the Magma Men from Crystallium.Weirdworld #1. Marvel Comics. Morgan le Fay and her forces gained an enemy in Arkon who had stolen from her many times.Weirdworld #2 She later hired Skull the Slayer to dispose of Arkon.Weirdworld #3. Marvel Comics. During the fight between Morgan le Fay's forces and the forces of the Swamp Queen, a variation of Jennifer Kale that ruled Weirdworld's Man-Things, Battleworld fell apart and neither side was victorious. Weirdworld somehow ended up on Earth-616 in the Bermuda Triangle.Weirdworld #5. Marvel Comics. Following the restoration of the Multiverse, the Weirdworld domain which was ruled by the Witch Queen le Fay, an alternate Morgan le Fay, was materialized in the new universe as an anomalous continent in the Bermuda Triangle. When a Boeing 747 crash-landed there, Morgan le Fay was informed by her minion Warg that a girl named Rebecca Rodriguez got a hold of the Wuxian Seed and that Goleta the Wizardslayer slew Ogeode.Weirdworld Vol. 2 #1. Marvel Comics. The Magma Man Moltar later told Morgan le Fay that their forces are ready to strike against the Swamp Queen's Army at the Fang Mountains. While still wanting to get her hands on the Wuxian Seed, Morgan le Fay told Moltar to divert the forces to pursue Rebecca Rodriguez and Goleta the Wizardslayer instead.Weirdworld Vol. 2 #2. Marvel Comics. Morgan le Fay later unleashed a Magma Man called the Mammoth Inferno to attack the Forge of the Grand Mechanic.Weirdworld Vol. 2 #3. Marvel Comics. Her backstory was revealed that she was sold into slavery upon being brought to Weirdworld. She overcame the slavery with the help of Elizabeth and Nakia the Grand Mechanic. This led to Morgan le Fay creating the Kingdom of the Torch.Weirdworld Vol. 2 #6. Marvel Comics. At the time when they were hiding from Patient Zero's creation Itsy Bitsy, Spider-Man and Deadpool helped the Bogswaggers of Bathsalthia escape from Morgan le Fay's forces.Spider- Man/Deadpool #13. Marvel Comics. When Roxxon Energy Corporation opened a portal to Weirdworld, they worked on a project that involved harvesting magic while contending with the invasive Skrullduggers.

Forensic facial reconstruction Vasili Vasilyevich Pronchishchev () (1702–) was a Russian explorer. In 1718, Vasili Pronchishchev graduated from Moscow School of Mathematics and Navigation and was promoted to naval cadet. In 1733, he was promoted to the rank of lieutenant and appointed head of one of the units of the Second Kamchatka Expedition, the purpose of which was to map the shores of the Arctic Ocean from the mouth of the Lena to the mouth of the Yenisey. In 1735, Vasili Pronchishchev went down the Lena River (from Yakutsk) on his sloop Yakutsk, doubled its delta, and stopped for wintering at the mouth of the Olenek River. Many members of the crew fell ill and died, mainly owing to scurvy. Despite the difficulties, in 1736, he reached the eastern shore of the Taymyr Peninsula and went north along its coastline. Finally Pronchishchev and his wife Maria (also referred to as Tatyana Feodorovna) succumbed to scurvy and died on the way back. Despite the death toll, the expedition was successful regarding the fulfillment of its goals. During his journey, Vasili Pronchishchev discovered a number of islands off the northeastern coast of the Taymyr Peninsula (Faddey Islands, Komsomolskoy Pravdy Islands, Saint Peter Islands). His expedition was the first to accurately map the Lena River from Yakutsk to its estuary and the Laptev seacoast from the Lena's mouth to the Gulf of Faddey. Pronchishchev's wife Maria Pronchishcheva (died September 12(23), 1736), who took part in his expedition, is considered the first female polar explorer. After their deaths, both of them were interred at the mouth of the Olenek River. Further information is now available from the Hakluit Society via a summary written by William Barr in July 2018, \\"The Arctic Detachments of the Russian Great Northern Expedition (1733-43) and their largely forgotten and even Clandestine Predecessors\\". On page 12 of the summary is shown information and maps on the Lena-Khatanga detachment led by Pronchishchev. A part of the eastern coastline of the Taymyr Peninsula and a ridge between the mouths of the Olenek and Anabar Rivers bear Vasili Pronchishchev's name. Icebreaker Vasili Pronchishchev, built in 1961 in Leningrad, was also named after this pioneering Arctic explorer. Maria Pronchishcheva Bay in the Laptev Sea is named after his wife Maria. ==References== * Historical data * Excavations at the burial site of the couple: Category:1702 births Category:1736 deaths Category:Explorers of the Arctic Category:Imperial Russian explorers Category:Explorers of Asia Category:Explorers of Siberia Category:Laptev Sea Category:Deaths from scurvy Category:18th-century Russian people Category:Great Northern Expedition Category:Imperial Russian Navy personnel ","title":"Vasili Pronchishchev"},{"id":"5562694","text":":There are also separate articles on The Who's album and song of the same name. My Generation is a game show on VH1 that was hosted by comedian Craig Shoemaker and announced by Lindsay Stoddart. Its 48 episodes aired for a brief period in 1998, and due to its similar format and emphasis on music, is considered to be a semi-revival of the 1969 ABC series The Generation Gap. ==Format== Two pairs of players from different graduation years – 1960 to 1995, typically 10–20 years apart – competed in a game of musical knowledge for a chance to win a trip. Round 1: The Singles Round Five categories were displayed, each with a question set for both teams' generations, and the winners of a coin toss chose the first set. Questions frequently had a brief skit or performance associated with them, similar to the MTV game show Remote Control. The first question in a set was asked as a toss-up open for all players to buzz-in individually. A correct answer awarded 50 points and the right to play a follow-up question for 100 points if desired, directed at the partner of the player who had answered the toss-up. If the partner answered the follow-up correctly, the team was asked a 200-point bonus question. A miss on any question passed control to the opponents and allowed them to answer if they chose; missing the toss-up or follow-up also deducted the relevant amount from a team's score. A question set went out of play as soon as any of the following occurred: * Both teams missed the same question * One team missed a question and their opponents chose not to attempt it * The team that scored on the toss-up declined the follow-up * Different teams answered the toss-up and follow-up correctly * The bonus question was asked The team in control then chose a new set. The round continued until time ran out or all 10 question sets had been played, whichever came first. A bonus prize was awarded to any team that chose a question set from their opponents' generation and answered the toss-up correctly (referred to as \\"crossing generations\\"). Round 2: The CD Round This round followed the same rules as Round 1, with all point values doubled and the trailing team choosing first from a new board of categories. Each team was given one Dedication to use during this round, which allowed them to force their opponents to answer a question meant for them. If the opponents missed, they were penalized appropriately and the team using the Dedication also received the points at stake; if the opponents answered correctly, they scored for the question instead. Round 3: The Speed Round The host read the combined names of two bands or songs (one from each team's generation), each with the same word missing, and the teams had to buzz-in and give the word. (Example: \\"C+C Roxy Factory\\" would lead to MUSIC, for C+C Music Factory and Roxy Music.) A correct answer awarded 200 points, while a miss deducted 200. The time limit for this round was variously 30 or 45 seconds; when time ran out, the team in the lead won a prize and advanced to the Time Warp bonus round. In some episodes, the teams were shown the names of two bands and had to give the title of a song released by both of them, or had to identify which of two similarly named bands recorded a particular song. Bonus Round: The Time Warp One team member was shown the name of one of 10 bands and had to give one clue of no more than two words to get their partner to guess it. Illegal clues (more than two words, using any portion of the name, etc.) forfeited that band. Bands started in the winning team's generation and moved gradually toward that of their defeated opponents. Either team member could pass on a band, and multiple guesses were allowed. The team won the grand prize for identifying seven bands within 60 seconds, with a smaller prize awarded for each correct guess.

He was born May 30, 1910, in Bridgwater, England, and moved with his parents and a brother and sister to Winnipeg, Canada, later to be abandoned by his father, Percival, and raised by his mother. Gravenor moved to Montreal in the late 1920s and following World War II he led Montreal's Non-Sectarian Anti-Nazi League, which - among other activities - sponsored European refugees fleeing the Nazi regime to resettle in Canada, making him one of the relatively few non-Jews to participate in such an initiative. Gravenor also worked as a public relations agent and newspaper writer for the scandal sheet Midnight in Montreal until 1956 when he bought Nun's Island, a largely uninhabited island adjacent to the thriving metropolis of Montreal, which was at that time Canada's economic hub. Gravenor paid representatives of an order of the Catholic Church, which then owned the sprawling island in the St. Lawrence River, $5,000 in cash for the initial transaction, with many steeper payments to come, including another $100,000 due within 90 days. The near-penniless Gravenor then started lobbying the federal government to build a bridge to the island. A few weeks later, as Gravenor was about to forfeit the property because he was unable to make his next payment, he benefitted from a serendipitous announcement by Canadian prime minister, Louis St-Laurent, of the construction of the Champlain Bridge, which would permit road access to the island for the first time. Gravenor's fortunes changed overnight, and he was able to sell his interest in the land for approximately $2 million—a very large sum in the 1950s. He subsequently operated a lucrative parking lot across the street from the Forum, home of the Montreal Canadiens hockey club, in downtown Montreal. He also participated in many maverick campaigns and was an outspoken crusader against the marketing of cow's milk, which he believed to be deleterious to human health. He died at his home at 1430 Chomedey St., Montreal, on August 25, 1993. He is the father of Montreal journalists JD Gravenor and Kristian Gravenor. ==References External links == * https://web.archive.org/web/20050227101040/http://www.cjnews.com/viewarticle.asp?id=3555 * https://web.archive.org/web/20070930012300/http://www.remer.org/genealogy/memorial_book/draft_book.html * https://web.archive.org/web/20060505080515/http://www.montrealmirror.com/ARCHIVES/1997/100997/news4.html No such article appears on this page.

She was also known by her married names, Fay Skurnick, and then Fay Levenson. The medium of most of the works Kleinman created is oil on canvas, but she also produced some mixed-media work and watercolors. She exhibited in museums in New York and Massachusetts and in galleries throughout the country. She was the co-founder of the Becket Arts Center in Becket, Massachusetts. /Fay Levenson noted as founder] ==Biography== Kleinman studied at the American Artists School: murals with Anton Refregier, painting with Jean Liberte, and sculpture with Milton Hebald. She also took classes through the WPA, City College of New York, and the National Academy of Design. Kleinman continued to paint into her nineties. She painted portraits of her daughter and both her grandsons. One portrait of her grandson, Randy Napoleon at ten years old was purchased in 2005 by the Ypsilanti District Library in Ypsilanti, Michigan, where it hangs in front of the children's collection. Another painting of Randy and paintings of Brian Napoleon were included in a 2006 show at the Ann Arbor District Library, Ordinary People, in which Kleinman showed the extraordinary qualities of \\"ordinary\\" individuals. In addition to portraits, she created abstractions, still lifes, and landscapes. She was best known for her \\"Zayde\\" series, paintings created from sketches her father did for her daughter based on stories her daughter, then three, made up for him. They were first exhibited in 1971 at the Becket Arts Center, Massachusetts. They were compared to the works of Paul Klee, include fanciful figures and places. After a career that included sales through galleries in New York and various New England cities, Kleinman sold many paintings in her senior years. In 2007 the University of Michigan purchased a mixed media self-portrait of a woman reading a newspaper. It is permanently displayed in the University's new East Ann Arbor Health Center. After her death, in August 2012, some of her paintings were displayed at Gallery 55+ in Ann Arbor and she was given a retrospective by the University of Michigan School of Art & Design./ More than 300 paintings were displayed in the latter, which chronicled Kleinman's career from the early 1930s through 2010, when she did her last full painting.http://mblog.lib.umich.edu/vrc/archives/2012/08/fay_kleinman.html University of Michigan School of Art & Design exhibit pageDetroit Jewish News, August 14. page 54, Loving Retrospective by Suzanne Chessler Local news site singled out her painting, The World Around Me, as the key work, saying it was painted with \\"a directness that’s a testimony to the aesthetic and social integrity that modernism sought to reflect.\\" Kleinman survived two husbands, Jack Skurnick, who died in 1952 and was the father of Davida, also known as Davi Napoleon. Skurnick was a record producer and violinist. She later married Emanuel Levenson, a pianist and music director of an opera company who taught music at The New School in New York City. He co-founded the Becket Arts Center with her. She was born in the Bronx, New York, where she lived until 1958, when she moved to Brooklyn Heights, also in New York City.

He invented the practice of \\"academic detailing\\" in which pharmacists, nurses, and physicians educate doctors about cost-effective prescribing practices using the same tactics that drug companies employ to market their products. He received a B.A. from Columbia University in 1969 and M.D. from Harvard Medical School in 1974. ==Early life and education== Avorn was born in 1948, in New York City and grew up in Rockaway, Queens. While attending Columbia University during the opposition to the Vietnam War and American civil rights movement, he was a campus activist against the Vietnam War with his investigative journalism for the Columbia Daily Spectator. In the summer of 1969, he wrote Up Against the Ivy Wall with fellow Spectator journalists about the campus uprisings at Columbia. Avorn graduated from Harvard Medical School with an M.D. in 1974. ==Career== Avorn was a resident at the Cambridge Hospital in Cambridge, Massachusetts and then at the Beth Israel Hospital (now the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, Massachusetts). He became an associate professor at Harvard Medical School in 1985 and a full professor in 2005. In 1983, he published his first paper on academic detailing. The practice has been taken up by several hospitals and governments, such as Pennsylvania, Washington, DC, Kentucky, Australia, Israel, and Nova Scotia. His work on academic detailing was featured in the Wall Street Journal and on The Daily Show. In 1996 he published \\"Reduction of bacteriuria and pyuria after ingestion of cranberry juice\\"http://jama.ama- assn.org/cgi/content/abstract/271/10/751 in the Journal of the American Medical Association which identified cranberry juice as an effective means of controlling urinary tract infections in elderly women. Avorn is also past president of the International Society for Pharmacoepidemiology. In 2004, he founded Alosa Health, a nonprofit organization that develops and implements academic detailing programs to improve prescribing. Avorn's paper on coxibs was one of the first medical research papers to demonstrate that Vioxx increased some patients' risk of heart attack and stroke. In 2006 he testified as a plaintiff’s expert witness in the Vioxx litigation, but he donates all profit from his involvement to Alosa Health. Avorn lives in Brookline, Massachusetts with his wife, community activist Karen Tucker.

Moskvitin is first attested in 1626 as residing among the Cossacks in Tomsk. In 1636 or 1637 Dmitry Kopylov with 54 men including Moskvitin were sent west toward Yakutsk. He went down the Lena River and up the Aldan River and on 28 June 1638 founded the fort of Butalsk about 100 km above the mouth of the Maya River and about 250 km southeast of Yakutsk. From a local Shaman Kopylov learned of a south-flowing \\"River Shirkol\\" (Zeya River?) where sedentary people grew grain and had cattle and, according to some sources, a silver deposit. In May 1639 he sent Moskvitin with 20 Tomsk Cossacks and 19 Krasnoyarsk Cossacks and an Evenk guide eastward. They went down the Aldan River and up the Maya River and from the upper Maya crossed the Dzhugdzhur Mountains and went down the Ulya River and in August 1639 reached the Sea of Okhotsk. At the river mouth, or 25 km above its mouth, they built winter quarters. On the first of October he and 20 men sailed east for three days and reached the Okhota River where the town of Okhotsk was later built. Then they either sailed 500 km further east to the Taui River, or they learned enough from the natives to make a map of the coast as far as the Taui River (sources differ). That winter they built two large boats. There was some fighting with the local Lamuts and they captured a man to use as a guide and interpreter. The captive told him of a \\"River Mamur\\" at whose mouth lived the \\"sedentary Gilyaks\\". In late April or early May 1640 he sailed southwest as far as Uda Gulf at the southwest corner of the Sea of Okhotsk. There they learned of the Amur River, the Zeya River and the Amgun River and of the \\"sedentary Gilyaks\\" on the coasts and islands and the \\"bearded Daurs\\" who had big houses, cattle and horses, ate bread and lived like Russians. They also heard that the bearded Daurs had recently come in boats and killed many Gilyaks. They then headed east, sighted the Shantar Islands and entered the Sakhalin Gulf. They may have seen the west coast of Sakhalin Island and seem to have reached some islands of the sedentary Gilyaks which may have been at the mouth of the Amur River. Because of the late season, they turned back and in November built winter quarters at the mouth of the Aldoma River which is 30 miles northeast of Ayan. By the middle of July 1641 they were back at Yakutsk. Information he provided enabled Kurbat Ivanov to make the first map of the coast (March 1642). In 1645 he and Kopylov proposed to the Tomsk voyevod Shcherbatsky a large military expedition to the Amur. The proposal was not acted upon. He was sent to Moscow in 1646 and returned to Tomsk in 1647 with the rank of ataman. The remainder of his life is undocumented. ==References== *George V Lantzeff and Richard A Pierce, \\"Eastward to Empire\\",1973 * Москвитин Иван Юрьевич // hrono.ru * for accuracy problems see the talk page.

It can be distinguished from its related species by its short, stout, gray-green leaves. These are acinaciform: mildly curved and shaped like a sabre, and having the shape of an isosceles triangle in cross- section, if cut perpendicularly. ==Distribution== This species is naturally endemic to the Western Cape, South Africa. Its natural habitat is coastal dunes, from as far north as Saldanha, across the Cape Peninsula, and eastwards to near Mossel Bay. It also occurs (as a more compact form) inland, from Cape Town to as far east as Riversdale. ==Cultivation== The pink or purple flowers are very showy and the plant is frequently cultivated, especially in mild coastal climates. Its fruits are edible and are used in southern Africa to make a traditional jam. In the wild they are grazed by tortoises and other southern African herbivores. In some areas, such as the south-west of England, it has become naturalised on sea cliffs and can outcompete native species. http://www.plantzafrica.com/plantcd/carpobed.htm The name \\"Sally-my-handsome\\" is derived from its former generic name of Mesembryanthemum. ==References== acinaciformis Category:Endemic flora of South Africa ~ Category:Renosterveld Category:Garden plants of Southern Africa ","title":"Carpobrotus acinaciformis"},{"id":"5562824","text":"Alan Douglas (born 16 October 1951, in Dundee) is a journalist and broadcaster.

It is headquartered in Charlotte, North Carolina, and owned and operated by Gray Television. It was founded in 1979 by husband and wife, Rick and Dee Ray. In the 1980s, Raycom Sports established a prominent joint venture with Jefferson- Pilot Communications which made them partners on the main Atlantic Coast Conference basketball package. Raycom was acquired in 1994 by Ellis Communications. Two years later, Ellis was acquired by a group led by Retirement Systems of Alabama, who renamed the entire company Raycom Media to build upon the awareness of Raycom Sports. The company would be acquired by Gray in 2019. The company was well known for its tenure with the ACC, and has also had former relationships with the SEC, Big Eight, and Big Ten conferences, as well as the now-defunct Southwest Conference. In the 2010s, Raycom lost both its ACC and SEC rights to ESPN (a network which had, in its early years, picked up Raycom-distributed ACC basketball games for national broadcasts), and transferred these rights to in-house cable networks. The company also produces sports telecasts for other entities; via Raycom Sports or related operation Tupelo Raycom, Gray produces NFL preseason games for several teams, including the Atlanta Falcons, Carolina Panthers and New Orleans Saints. ==History== Founding Raycom Sports was started in July 1979 by Rick and Dee Ray in Charlotte. Rick Ray was a program manager at WCCB in Charlotte when he proposed that WCCB, which had become an independent station a year earlier after losing its ABC affiliation, produce more basketball games. Ray thought that they would be very profitable for WCCB, given North Carolina's reputation as a college basketball hotbed. The company's first event was the Great Alaska Shootout. Ken Haines was one of the first hired for Raycom Sports. In its first year, it also acquired rights to basketball games from the Atlantic Coast Conference: some of them were syndicated to a newly-launched cable sports channel, ESPN. In 1988, Raycom added Big Ten Conference games to its portfolio after acquiring Rasmussen Communications. The company also extended its contract through 1995 to gain rights to all non-network conference games. The following year, Raycom established a radio division, acquiring the rights to the University of Illinois and Purdue University radio networks. Partnership with Jefferson- Pilot Communications In 1980, Raycom made what would prove to be its biggest splash when it teamed up with Jefferson-Pilot Communications to take over production of ACC basketball games. The package had begun in 1957 when Greensboro businessman C. D. Chesley piped North Carolina's run to the 1957 national title to a hastily created network of five stations across North Carolina. It proved popular enough that it expanded to a full-time package of basketball games the following season. The January 14, 1973 game between NC State @ Maryland was the first Super Bowl Sunday college basketball national telecast. Chelsey would again syndicate an ACC game (Maryland @ NC State) nationally on Super Bowl Sunday the following year. The ACC title game was often syndicated outside of the ACC region (such as New York) in these years. The commentators that Chelsey used included Jim Thacker, Ray Scott, Billy Packer, and Dick Enberg (on the UCLA @ Maryland contest on December 28, 1974 and Notre Dame @ Maryland contest on January 4, 1975, both which were co- productions with TVS). In 1978, Chesley (who controlled the ACC rights at the time) wanted NBC to televise some ACC conference games as part of its national package as it had the previous few years. However, NBC wanted to feature intersectional games. This offended Chesley, who proceeded to sell the rights to the ACC tournament final to ABC and also explains the absence of ACC home games on NBC's 1977–78 schedule. Chesley retained the rights to ACC games until 1980, when the conference bought him out and sold the rights to MetroSports of Rockville, Maryland. Some ACC games were telecast by Raycom alone in 1980 through four or five television stations in North Carolina, including WCCB. For the 1980-81 season, the two companies formed a joint venture, Raycom/JP Sports, that won the package after the ACC turned down Metrosports' bid to renew its contract. Raycom also assisted ESPN2 by selling a mid-1990s Duke-Carolina basketball game that increased the channel's credibility with cable operators. In the 1982 season, Raycom experimented with a cable-oriented ACC service known as ACC Ticket. Raycom had built a large array of broadcasting rights until the 1990s, with rights for ACC, SEC, Pac-10, Metro, Big Eight, Big 12, and Southwest conferences. Raycom sub- licensed ACC games to national broadcasters (including CBS, and ESPN), regional sports networks, and local stations. However, with the rise of cable and regional sports networks, Raycom began to lose many of its college rights to competitors. Unlike other sports syndicators, Raycom controlled nearly all advertising for the broadcast, but paid stations for the airtime. While this was a risky strategy at first, Raycom reaped a huge windfall since ACC games frequently garnered ratings in the 20s and 30s. The ACC's regional territory happened to include several fast-growing markets such as Charlotte, the Piedmont Triad, the Triangle, Hampton Roads, Richmond, Baltimore, and Washington, D.C. Raycom Media In 1994, Raycom Sports was sold to Ellis Communications, but remained autonomous, with its own headquarters in Charlotte. Dee Ray left in 1994 while Rick Ray left in 1995. When an investment group led by Retirement Systems of Alabama bought Ellis in 1996, the Raycom name was so well respected that it chose to rename the entire broadcast group Raycom Media. In 1994, Raycom first organized a pre-season event known as the Great Eight, televised by ESPN, which aimed to feature two nights of doubleheaders between regional finalists from the previous season's NCAA tournament (with the highest-ranked team eliminated before the regional finals serving as a backup if a team declined an invitation). The inaugural edition featured Boston College, Duke, Florida, Michigan, Missouri, Purdue, Villanova, and UConn (which replaced Arkansas as a backup). Several teams (including defending champion UCLA, Connecticut and North Carolina) declined invites, while Michigan State received an invite. In 1996, the event moved to United Center under a five-year contract. By August 1997, Raycom lost the Pac-10 and Big 12 college football advertising sales rights to Fox Sports Networks. Several executives also left the company, including Steedman. In 2002, Raycom founded the Continental Tire Bowl in Charlotte. It continues to operate the game, which later changed its name to the Meineke Car Care Bowl until 2011, when it became the Belk Bowl. Starting in 2004, the Raycom/JP partnership took over production of syndicated ACC football games; Jefferson- Pilot had produced ACC football alone since September 1984. In 2007, Raycom began broadcasting the ACC men's basketball tournament in HDTV and broadcast 4 ACC men's basketball regular season games in HD in 2008. In 2006, in accordance with Lincoln National Corporation's acquisition of Jefferson-Pilot, Jefferson-Pilot Communications was renamed Lincoln Financial Media, and the venture was renamed Raycom/LF Sports. On November 12, 2007, Raycom Media announced its intention to acquire some of the television broadcasting properties of Lincoln Financial Media—including three television stations, plus Lincoln Financial Sports—for $583 million. Lincoln Financial Sports was merged into Raycom Sports later that year, giving it full control over basketball and football rights for both the ACC and SEC. In 2008, Raycom lost its SEC rights to ESPN, who reached a 15-year deal to become its main media rightsholder alongside CBS. ESPN continued to provide a syndicated package of games in a similar manner to Raycom, produced via its own syndication division under the on-air branding SEC Network until the launch of an SEC cable network under the same name in 2014.Raycom loses Southeastern Conference Charlotte Business Journal, August 25, 2008. In 2010, ESPN also acquired rights to ACC football and basketball, replacing Raycom. In a discussion between ACC commissioner John Swofford and then-ESPN president John Skipper, Swofford acknowledged Raycom's long-standing relationship with the conference, and requested that it continue to be involved in some way. ESPN ultimately negotiated a sub-licensing agreement with Raycom, which would allow it to continue producing a syndicated package of ACC football and basketball broadcasts (which, as a condition of the deal, were rebranded under the new on-air title ACC Network in 2010). Additionally, Raycom became responsible for the ACC's digital media operations and sponsorship sales. For the final season of Raycom Sports' syndicated ACC football and basketball package, the 2018-19 academic year, the ACC Network branding was changed back to Raycom Sports to avoid confusion with the ESPN-ACC Network scheduled for launch in August 2019. In addition to the syndication component of the 2010 agreement, Raycom brokered a deal for another package of ACC football and basketball content which was dubbed the ACC Regional Sports Networks (RSN). ACC RSN broadcasts, produced by Raycom Sports production staff, were distributed nationally across a litany of cable sports networks including Fox Sports South, NESN, AT&T; Sportsnet Pittsburgh, NESN, NBC Washington and YES, among others. Wes Durham served as the lead play-by-play voice of both football and basketball RSN packages from 2013-2019. In 2012, Raycom Media acquired Tupelo-Honey, a producer of sports and entertainment programming. Three years later, it also acquired WebStream Sports, an Indianapolis-based producer of sports programming. In late-2016, the companies were merged to form the subsidiary Tupelo Raycom. Haines retired as president at the end of 2015. Hunter Nickell, a former Speed Channel executive, replaced Haines as CEO in May 2016. In January 2018, Raycom Sports announced a partnership with Blizzard Entertainment to produce a weekly television program chronicling Heroes of the Dorm—the official collegiate tournament of its video game Heroes of the Storm.  End of ACC syndication  On July 21, 2016, ESPN announced a 20-year extension of its contract with the ACC, and the launch of an ACC Network cable channel in 2019. ESPN also acquired the secondary ACC rights previously held by Raycom. However, Raycom Sports will continue to serve as the ACC's RSN and digital partner, and be subcontracted by ESPN to produce event coverage for the new ACC Network. Raycom's final syndicated ACC telecast was the 2019 ACC Men's Basketball Tournament final. ==Personalities== College basketball * Mike Gminski analyst (2003–2019) * Dan Bonner analyst (1983–2019) * Tim Brando play-by-play (1990–2019) * Steve Martin play-by-play (1991–2019) College football * Dave Archer analyst (2010–2019) * Tommy Bowden analyst (2011–2019) * Tim Brant play-by-play (2008–2016) * Steve Martin play- by-play (1991–2019) College baseball * Tommy Hutton analyst (2012–2019) ==Awards==  Midsouth Regional Emmy Awards  Raycom Sports' production department won 34 Midsouth Regional Emmy Awards between 2009 and 2020.

It covers 9.78 km² area and reaches a depth of 50.2m which makes it the third deepest lake in Lithuania. It lies partly in Molėtai district, Švenčionys district and Vilnius district. The alternative name comes from the historical Dubingiai Castle, constructed on the former island, and the small town of Dubingiai situated on the lake. The town is a popular tourist destination. Žeimena River flows south of the lake and people rent boats or kayaks to go down the river to the Neris River. The lake formed when water flowed under the melting icecaps during the last glacial period. Such lakes are similar to rivers: they are long, narrow (the greatest width of Asveja is only 880 m.), and deep. Other such lakes in Lithuania include Tauragnas, Sartai and Aisetas. In 1992 Asveja Regional Park was established to protect the ecosystem and landscape. One of the curiosities is a wooden bridge across the lake. It was built in 1934 and is still in use. President Antanas Smetona participated in the opening of the first bridge across a lake in Lithuania.

In 1894, Solomon Andrews, a Cardiff entrepreneur, bought land overlooking the Mawddach estuary. On the site he completed Mawddach Crescent in 1902. The row of terraced properties was the start of a purpose-built holiday resort he intended for the area. However the planned development went no further because the surrounding land proved unsuitable for urban planning. During the Second World War, the Royal Marines commandeered Mawddach Crescent. It became known as Iceland Camp. The marines also built huts on nearby Fegla Fawr, the foundation bases can still be seen between the trees above the estuary. The village was served by Arthog railway station (on the Barmouth - Ruabon line) until the complete closure of the line in 1964. The line is now a footpath known as the Mawddach Trail (), and is popular with both walkers and cyclists. According to the 2011 census, 28.3% of the community's residents were able to speak Welsh.

Although the Balletmaster created many pas de trois for the near 150 ballets he created throughout his career in Russia, only three survive: the Pas de trois des Odalisques from his revival of the ballet Le Corsaire (set to the music of Adolphe Adam and Cesare Pugni, choreographed for three women); the Paquita Pas de trois added to his 1881 revival of the ballet Paquita (set to the music of Ludwig Minkus and Eduard Deldevez, sometimes referred to as the Golden Pas de trois or Minkus Pas de trois, and choreographed for two women and one man); and the Pas de trois from the first act of his 1895 revival of the ballet Swan Lake (choreographed for two women and one man). Typically, Petipa fashioned the Entrée of a pas de trois in such a way so that the dancer who performs the first variation exits the stage about three quarters of the way through in order to rest and prepare for his or her solo. == See also == * Pas de deux * Pas de quatre * Grand pas Category:Ballet terminology ","title":"Pas de trois"},{"id":"5563029","text":"Deviant Records was a London-based record label founded by publisher and music producer Rob Deacon in the mid 90s, releasing electronic works that were at the cutting edge in their field - Pentatonik, Node (Flood, Ed Buller, Mel Wesson & Dave Bessell), Schematix, The Orb, Humate, Phat Gecko (Luke Corradine), Spooky and Witchman.

The celebration is of ancient Christian origin, the date selected being the anniversary of either their death or the translation of their relics.The Catholic Encyclopedia, Volume XI (Robert Appleton Company, New York, 1911), s.v. \\"St. Paul\\", accessed 4 June 2007. ==Eastern Christianity== For Eastern Orthodox and some Eastern Catholic Christians this feast also marks the end of the Apostles' Fast (which began on the Monday following All Saints' Sunday, i.e., the second Monday after Pentecost). It is considered a day of recommended attendance, whereon one should attend the All-Night Vigil (or at least Vespers) on the eve, and the Divine Liturgy on the morning of the feast (there are, however, no \\"Days of Obligation\\" in the Eastern Church). In the Julian calendar, 29 June falls on the Gregorian calendar date of 12 July from 1900 - 2099, inclusive. In the Russian Orthodox tradition, Macarius of Unzha's Miracle of the Moose is said to have occurred during the Apostles' Fast and the Feast of Saints Peter and Paul that followed it. ==Western Christian tradition== In the General Roman Calendar, the celebration is a solemnity. In earlier editions, it was ranked as a Double (Tridentine Calendar), Double of the First Class (e.g., General Roman Calendar of 1954), or First-Class Feast (General Roman Calendar of 1960). Prior to the liturgical reforms of Pope Pius XII, this feast was followed by a common octave. It is a holy day of obligation in the Latin Church, although individual conferences of bishops can suppress the obligation.Codex Iuris Canonici (1983), canon 1246. In England, Scotland and Wales the feast is observed as a holy day of obligation while in the United States and Canada, it is not. The Feast ceased being a Holy Day of Obligation in the United States in 1840. In Malta it is a public holiday and in Maltese known as L-Imnarja. In 1577 Jan Rubens named his son Peter Paul, because he was born during the office of vespers of this day.Historische levensbeschryving van P.P. Rubens Door Jean Francois Marie Michel p.14 On this feast, newly created metropolitan archbishops receive from the pope the primary symbol of their office, the pallium. The Anglican Communion celebrates the Feast of St Peter and St Paul on 29th June as a lesser festival. The Lutheran Churches celebrate 29 June as the Feast of Saints Peter and Paul; it holds the rank of a Lesser Festival. The Voice of the Martyrs, a non- governmental organization that aids persecuted Christians, has designated 29 June as the \\"Day of the Christian Martyr\\", in honour of the martyrdom of Saints Peter and Paul, as well as all martyrs for the Christian faith. ==Oriental Orthodox tradition== The Coptic Orthodox Church and the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church are also celebrated on the day 5 Epip which is also the end of the fast of the apostles.https://st-takla.org/Full-Free-Coptic- Books/Synaxarium-or-Synaxarion/11-Abeeb/05-Abeeb.html ==Spiritual Christian tradition== Although the Canadian Doukhobors, a Spiritual Christian denomination, do not venerate saints, the Feast of St. Peter and St. Paul has traditionally been a day of celebration for them. Since 1895, it has acquired a new significance as a commemoration of the \\"Burning of the Arms\\", the Doukhobors' destruction of their weapons, as a symbol of their refusal to participate in government-sponsored killing. It is celebrated now by their descendants as simply \\"Peter's Day\\" (Russian: Petro den.), sometimes referred to as the \\"Doukhobor Peace Day\\".Tarasoff, Koozma J. The Doukhobor Peace Day, May 4, 2002 In the region of Southeastern Italy called Puglia, the celebration of the Saints is connected to folkloristic Taranta dance. Folklore discusses people dancing after a spider's bite. The specific spider breed referenced is the Tarantula. According to folklore, people started a liberatory and compulsive dance and asked the saints to set them free from the sin and the curse. The main city where this happened is Galatina, where the basilica of Saint Peter and Paul is located. ==Public holiday== The feast is observed in Rome because St. Paul and St. Peter are patron saints of the Eternal City. It is also a public holiday of the Canton of Ticino, Switzerland, as well as parts of the Swiss cantons of Lucerne and Graubünden. It is a public holiday in Peru, in Malta, and in various municipalities of the Philippines. ==See also== * Feast of Saints Peter and Paul, patron saint archive * Golowan Festival * Incident at Antioch, a dispute between Peter and Paul * International Day of Prayer for the Persecuted Church * St Peter's Eve ==ReferencesExternal links== * The Holy Glorious and All-Praised Leader of the Apostles, Peter & Paul Icon and Synaxarion of the Feast (Orthodox) Peter Peter Category:Public holidays in Switzerland Category:June observances Category:July observances ","title":"Feast of Saints Peter and Paul"},{"id":"5563034","text":"Langenselbold () is a town in the Main-Kinzig district, in Hesse, Germany.

In 2009 the company was bought by Philips to become Philips-Dynalite. The system is commonly used for lighting control, building automation, home automation and room automation applications and is sold worldwide. Sunday, 21 July 2019 ==System design== The Dynalite system consists of: User Interfaces - Switches, panels, motion and heat sensors, touch screens and recently IOS devices, Panels are typically standard sized (Australian or European standard size) wall switch plates, but instead of normal rocker switches, they have buttons of various designs, usually with an indicator LED inside. Output devices - Dimmers, Relays, LED drivers and DALI, DSI and 0–10 volt controllers. The dimmers range anywhere from a single 240 V relay controller to leading and trailing edge 1-20 amp dimmer devices. Network Backbone Devices: Network connectors extend the range of the network, as well as providing integration with other technologies such as AMX, Crestron, etc. Through the 100-BT device, the communication network can be extended over TCP/IP networks, which also allows the use of computer systems which can integrate into the system. ==Areas and channels== The network components are all used to set a system of Areas and Channels. Any given lighting, fan, louvre, and relay circuit is a Channel in an Area. For example, a house might have 3 rooms. Each room is called an Area. The kitchen may contain overhead lights, a range-hood fan and lights over the bench. These three are called Channels. Those Areas and Channels are in states called Presets. In Preset 1, typically, all lights etc. are fully on, in Preset 4, all of the lights are off. This is all customisable either by the programmer, or if it has been allowed, by the end user as well. So, sending 'Area 3 Preset 4' will turn off the lights in Area 3 (room 3). Sending 'Area 3 Preset 2' will set the lights to a low level, which is customisable. Channels can also be sent presets aside from the preset of the area to which they belong. 'Area 3 Preset 4' turns off the lights, then 'Area 3 Channel 7 Preset 1' will turn that light back on. ==Communications== Dynalite components communicate using DyNet. The physical layer consists of a modified RS-485 TIA/EIA-485-A serial bus running along CAT5 cable, blue and blue/white carry the hot and cold signal respectively, orange and orange/white carry +12 V DC, green and green/white carry 0 V, Brown and Brown/white are unused. End of line termination is required http://lighting.philips.com/pwc_li/main/subsites/dynalite/library_support/assets/technical_guides/control_principles_rev_d.pdf DyNet 1 is the most commonly used protocol over the bus, being messages of 8 bytes of data, the 8th byte being a checksum. Data is send at speed of 9600 baud, 8 bits, no parity, 1 stopbit (8N1). Commonly there are two types of message sent via DyNet 1: logical and physical. Logical messages talk to Areas and Channels, and physical messages talk directly to the devices. These 2 are typically called 1C and 5C messages, on account of the first byte of their message. A 1C message consist of: [1C] [Area] [Data 1] [OpCode] [Data 2] [Data 3] [Join] [Checksum] Area is the Logical Area the message is to control. OpCode defines the Action to be taken on the Area. Join is a bitswitch which can be used to filter out selected channels. An OpCode of 00 to 03 means the action is to send the given area into preset 1 to 4 plus 8 times the value of Data 3 over the time specified by Data 1 and Data 2. An OpCode of 0A to 0D means the action is to send the given area into preset 5 to 8 plus 8 times the value of Data 3 over the time specified by Data 1 and Data 2. That gives a possibility of 8 × 255 presets. A usual job uses 4 to 8, and generally preset 4 is reserved to 'Off' or 'all to 0%'. DyNet 2 is used mainly to upload data to devices on the network. It allows larger messages of data to be sent at higher speeds (115200 baud), significantly reducing lag time. ==Advantages== Each device contains its own programmable logic controller and follows the peer-to-peer model, the main advantage of this is that there is no reliance on a single central controller, the system is capable of a high level of resilience and therefore well suited to situations where total failure could be a safety issue, such as lighting systems in public places. The 'Message on Change' system only sends a message every time a lighting state is to change, as opposed to the DMX protocol, which is constantly streaming the entire data- map. This allows for much more devices on a single bus, but also leads to missed messages - as below. As most of the DyNet is openly published, it is possible to integrate with third party devices. ==Disadvantages== The DyNet protocol offers no error correction or transmission control, each network message is sent on a 'best effort' basis. This means that if a transmitted message is corrupted or missed by a receiving device, there is nothing to pick up that the message was not received, but also makes for much faster communication and response to user input in ideal situations. The design opens the possibility of devices missing messages. In the case of a user pushing a button to turn on a light, this does not present a large problem as the user will probably notice and press the button again, but if it is an automated message say, from a timeclock, there is potential for an important message turning on outside lights of a shopping center to be missed. The usual workaround for this is to simply send the important message twice or more. The previous Dynalite programming software (dLight 2) commonly in use up to 2011, (and still sometimes used for older equipment) was built progressively upon a Windows 3.11 application, and hides many undocumented keyboard shortcuts which are necessary to program a system. The Envision editor was launched in 2010 and is designed to be more intuitive and easy to use. It is designed for programmers - it is not expected that end users will be able to set up their own systems, one needs training (usually free) provided by Dynalite distributors. ==Implementations== A selection of large scale installations of DyNet in buildings: *Australian National Museum - Canberra (AU) *Australian National University - Canberra (AU) *BT Convention Centre - Liverpool (UK) convention centre *Burj Khalifa - World's tallest building *Burswood Entertainment Complex - Perth WA *Crown Casino - Melbourne (AUS) Casino *Du HQ - Du Head office Dubai *Echo Arena Liverpool - Liverpool (UK) arena *Gold Coast Convention and Exhibition Centre - Gold Coast QLD *Google - Office in Bogota, Colombia *Grand Hyatt - Dubai hotel *Jin Mao Building - Previously China's tallest building *Manolas Residence - Perth WA *Te Papa - New Zealand museum *National Museum of Scotland - Edinburgh Scotland (UK) Museum *Perth Convention Exhibition Centre - Perth WA *Suncorp Stadium - Australian Olympic venue *The Roundhouse - London (UK) theatre *Titan Plaza - Mall in Bogota, Colombia *Trafford Centre - Manchester (UK) shopping mall *Westfield - London (UK) shopping mall ==See also== *Home automation *Intelligent building *Lighting control system *Smart Environments *Room automation *touch panel == References Sources== *Dynalite's press release page *Dynalite's technical documentation page ==External links== *Dynalite's homepage Category:Manufacturing companies of Australia Category:Electronics companies of Australia Category:Lighting brands Category:Building automation Category:Home automation companies ","title":"Dynalite"},{"id":"5563055","text":"Trachystemon orientalis, commonly known as Abraham-Isaac-Jacob, is a perennial herb of the family Boraginaceae.

The Foundation is located at the Kansas Sampler Center near Inman, Kansas. According to the organization's web site and publications, the mission is to preserve and sustain rural culture by educating Kansans about Kansas by networking and encouraging the support of rural communities. The support is generally in the form of encouraging awareness of, and commerce with, rural businesses. Methods include positive messages of motivation encouraging people to celebrate the sunflower state. Founded in 1993 by Mil and Marci Penner, the Kansas Sampler Foundation is based at the Penner family farm. The Foundation stresses keeping rural Kansas vigorous. Accentuating rural culture elements like architecture, art, commerce, cuisine, customs, geography, history, and people -- the goal is to get more Kansans to realize (and visit) the treasures in their state. Any one of these elements puts a person, place or thing on the list of places to see. They are reasons to celebrate towns. There is also a checklist to help communities catalog what they have to offer. Small rural towns are seen as critical to the continued character of Kansas. ==Kansas Sampler Festival== Supporters sample rural Kansas culture elements by attending the Kansas Sampler Festival.\\"Kansas City, Mo., Businesses to Offer Discounts, Giveaways during Tourism Week,\\" Rick Alm. The Kansas City Star, Mo. Distributed by Knight Ridder Tribune Business News. Washington: May 4, 2002. pg. 1.\\"Statewide events in Kansas kick off today with the annual Kansas Sampler Festival..\\" It takes place annually, roving to different Kansas communities every two years. About eight thousand people attended the 2006 festival in Garden City, Kansas. Approximately four hundred volunteers worked together to help put it on. It returned to the Lee Richardson Zoo in the spring of 2007. It has taken place in Inman, Kansas, Pratt, Kansas, Independence, Kansas and Ottawa, Kansas and in Concordia, Kansas, in the years since. Much of the work of the Foundation matches the grass-roots, forward- thinking example of businesses and attractions featured at the Kansas Sampler Festival. The currency of awareness is spread in newsletters, and attitudes among member-supporters are tilted towards accentuating positive, mutual success and common survival -- indeed a core value of the Foundation. There are group outings, and campaigns by members to trek across Kansas, finding out-of-the-way attractions, people and stories. There several areas of interest under the umbrella of the foundation, and many ways to participate. Principal among them is the Kansas Explorers Club. Foundation director Marci Penner said, \\"The club helps people know what there is to see and do in the nooks and crannies of the state.\\" The Foundation's goal is to get 5,000 Kansas Explorer Club members. Organizers believe that \\"with that number of explorers driving around the state and spending money in small town cafes and specialty shops and appreciating the historic sites and natural landmarks it will help keep our towns alive and thriving.\\" ==Kansas Explorer's Club== Simply put, The Kansas Explorers Club is a group of people bound by the common interest of exploring Kansas. The Explorers Club newsletter comes out six times a year. In the pages, there are examples of places where the membership might go to explore, to find locally owned businesses, and to experience lesser-known aspects of the state. Suggested day-trips often lead the Explorer on a themed trip, such as visiting surviving examples of the Old West in Kansas, a western-themed local eatery, and a bed and breakfast that dates back to frontier days. One of the guiding principals is that Explorers 'dare to do dirt' - that is, they will seek out elusive best-kept secrets, and don't mind coming home tired, sunburned and with muddy boots for the experience. The stories, cautions, and recommendations from the trips appear in the newsletter. One motto is \\"It's About the Journey\\" which speaks to exploring. Celebrated explorers have taken it upon themselves to venture across Kansas for a certain purpose; Explorers might wish to eat lunch in as many towns as possible, or try to drink a beer in every Kansas county. The list of such Explorer accomplishments grew significantly after one explorer in particular gathered nationwide media attention for his crusade. There is a secret, ritual greeting among members, and there is an annual 'Happening', specifically for the purpose of lots of Explorers trekking to one spot en masse. The Kansas Explorers Club was founded in 1994\\"Traveler finds simple pleasures along back alleys of Kansas,\\" Eric Weslander. Journal-World, Lawrence, Kan. Knight Ridder Tribune Business News. Washington: Jul 16, 2006. pg. 1 already has 1,800 members and is growing every day. The club also plans Group Adventures to places not normally accessible to the public and once a year they have a Grand Expedition. The Grand Expedition is a bus tour designed to help the public see common sights of Kansas with new eyes. Individual membership to the club is $18.61 (the year Kansas became a state). Members receive a membership card, the regular newsletters and information about trips, but they also learn the secret explorer greeting ritual.

Whatever the focus, We Kan! members enjoy the camaraderie of each other, the sharing of ideas, and a one-for-all, all-for-one attitude.\\" according to the Sampler Foundation website . We Kan! awards are presented to distinguished Explorers annually. The We Kan! newsletter is published to motivate, and to educate about strategies to help sustain rural Kansas culture. Articles outline the importance of spending in favor of small businesses, in order to keep them alive. The pages often bring tactics for making a difference, however small, in the life of a small town, and explains in some depth how and why rural commerce struggles to survive. There are also pointers as to changes in businesses around the state, and simple inexpensive steps for the individual to take to make a difference. An example is buying postage stamps at smaller post offices, so small towns can keep their U.S. Post Office open, and take a step back from the brink of disappearing.  Lizard Lips  In the tiny Woodson County town of Toronto, Kansas - population less than 300 in 2003, there is Lizard Lips Grill and Deli. \\"The Kansas Guidebook for Explorers\\" The Kansas Guidebook for Explorers 2005, By Marci Penner http://kansasguidebook.com/ says the \\"combination deli, convenience store, and bait shop\\" is a good source for area information. But is also a part of We Kan! lore. Lizard Lips is an example of a small, private business - vital to a community and on the cusp of bankruptcy, until We Kan! came along. They were challenged to go to the store and spend five dollars to keep it vital. The plan worked. The business stands out as a practical example of grass roots success in rural cultural commerce. ==Marci Penner== Marci Penner founded the Kansas Sampler Foundation with her father, Mil Penner in 1993. The two had seen much of what the state of Kansas had to offer in their travels co- authoring a series of guidebooks, and found themselves championing small town survival not long after. She is the editor and publisher of the foundations newsletters, and her most recent book --\\"The Kansas Guidebook for Explorers\\" The Kansas Guidebook for Explorers 2005, By Marci Penner http://kansasguidebook.com/ -- came out in 2005.

They were based on the hulls of incomplete Loch class anti-submarine (A/S) frigates. In 1959 and 1961, four frigates of the class (Bigbury Bay, Burghead Bay, Morecambe Bay and Mounts Bay) were transferred to the Portuguese Navy. Between 1966 and 1968, based in Mozambique, these ships were part of the Portuguese naval deterrent force against the Royal Navy Beira Patrol. In 1966 the Portuguese Navy also bought the survey vessel Dalrymple which served until 1983. ==Design== The Bay class made use of the hull, machinery, lattice mast and superstructure of incomplete Loch-class frigates. The armament was altered to suit them to the A/A role, with twin QF 4 in Mark XVI guns fore and aft in mounts HA/LA Mark XIX fitted with remote power control (RPC), controlled by a rangefinder-director Mark V carried on the bridge and fitted with Type 285 radar for range taking. Due to a shortage of supply of guns and mountings, many ships had these removed from laid up \\"WAIR\\" conversions and s that were constructive total losses. A pair of Mark V \\"utility\\" mounts for twin 40 mm Bofors guns were sited amidships, each with its own predictive Simple Tachymetric Director (STD) for fire control. The A/A armament was completed by a pair of mounts Mark V for twin 20 mm Oerlikon guns, carried in the bridge wings. Later, the Oerlikons were replaced with single mounts Mark VII for Bofors guns, a further pair of which were added amidships on raised platforms. For A/S use, a Hedgehog projector was carried on the fo'c'sle and the quarterdeck carried two racks and four throwers for up to 50 depth charges. In addition to the Radar Type 285 fire control set, Radar Type 291 air warning was carried at the head of the topmast in addition to Radar Type 276 (later 293) target indication at the masthead. The associated IFF transponders were also carried on the foremast to distinguish between friendly and enemy targets and a high frequency direction finder (HF/DF) was carried on a short pole mainmast aft. Six Bays were completed to different designs. Dundrum Bay and Gerrans Bay were renamed Alert and Surprise and completed as \\"despatch vessels\\", commander-in-chief's (C-in-C) yachts for the Mediterranean and Far East Fleets. These ships omitted the Mark V Bofors mounts and the aft guns and had the superstructure extended to provide additional flag accommodation and stepped a tall mainmast. The four other ships were completed as survey vessels, specifically to deal with the vast numbers of uncharted wrecks and mines around the British Isles from wartime. They were unarmed, except for four 3-pounder saluting guns. They had shorter forward shelter decks and carried survey boats under davits abreast the funnel and minesweeping gear aft. ==Ships== Frigates * (ex- Loch Carloway) - built by Hall Russell, laid down 30 May 1944, launched 16 November 1944 and completed 10 July 1945.

Released on Atco Records, it peaked at No. 29 on the Billboard 200 in April 1970,Refer to Both Sides Now Publications' Atco Records LP Discography (http://bsnpubs.com/atlantic/atco266389.html). at #39 on the British album chart, and was certified a gold record by the RIAA.UK Chart Stats webpage ==Content and reissue== The album features Delaney and Bonnie's best-known touring band, including Eric Clapton, Jim Gordon, Carl Radle, Bobby Whitlock, and Dave Mason. Many of the players on this album would later go on to work with George Harrison on his post-Beatles debut album All Things Must Pass and with Clapton on his solo debut. The horn players Bobby Keys and Jim Price would play on the albums Sticky Fingers and Exile on Main St. by the Rolling Stones, and join them for their 1972 STP Tour. Whitlock, Radle, and Gordon would form with Clapton his band Derek and the Dominos for Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs. As no pictures of Delaney and Bonnie were deemed good enough for the album cover, a photo was used instead of a Rolls-Royce Silver Dawn in a desert, reportedly taken by manager Barry Feinstein while working as a photographer covering a Bob Dylan tour in 1966. Dylan's feet are those hanging from the car window. On Tour was re-issued in 2010 as four-disc box set, packaged in a mock road case containing the complete performance from the Royal Albert Hall, plus a composite of the next night's performances at Colston Hall in Bristol, and both the early and late shows from the tour's final stop at Fairfield Halls in Croydon. George Harrison played slide guitar on the English leg of the tour that followed the Albert Hall performance, as well as in Scandinavia, which are represented on discs 2-4.https://www.discogs.com/Delaney-Bonnie-Friends-With-Eric-Clapton-On- Tour/release/3573979 ==Reception== The album has received highly positive reviews, with many critics suggesting the album is superior to Clapton's prior project (Blind Faith). In the Rolling Stone Album Guide, the album is described as \\"a triumph\\", which is attributed to the fact the band was \\"one of the best\\" in \\"rock and roll\\". Writing for Rolling Stone, Mark Kemp said the album contained \\"wicked performances of the kind of country and boogie that would define Southern rock\\". https://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/on-tour-with-eric-clapton- deluxe-edition-20100812 Mojo described the album as \\"one of the two Rosetta Stones of roots rock'n'roll\\". ==Track listing== ;Side one ;Side two ==2010 deluxe edition box setPersonnel== * Bonnie Bramlett — vocals * Delaney Bramlett — guitars, vocals * Eric Clapton — lead guitars, vocals * Rita Coolidge — backing vocals * Jim Gordon — drums, percussion * George Harrison (under the pseudonym L'Angelo Misterioso) – guitars (discs two — four of box set only)https://www.discogs.com/Delaney-Bonnie-Friends-With-Eric-Clapton-On- Tour/release/3573979 * Tex Johnson – percussion * Bobby Keys — saxophone * Dave Mason — guitars * Carl Radle — bass guitar * Jim Price — trombone, trumpet * Bobby Whitlock — organ, keyboards, vocals ;Production personnel * Jimmy Miller, Delaney Bramlett — producers * Bill Halverson — mixing * Andy Johns, Glyn Johns, Tex Johnson — recording engineers * Jim Price – horn arrangements * Barry Feinstein – photography * Tom Wilkes — design, photography ==See also== * Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs * All Things Must Pass ==References== Category:Delaney & Bonnie albums Category:Eric Clapton live albums Category:Albums produced by Jimmy Miller Category:1970 live albums Category:Atco Records live albums Category:Albums produced by Delaney Bramlett ","title":"On Tour with Eric Clapton"},{"id":"5563105","text":"Humate was until 1996 a German trance group, then just the German record producer Gerret Frerichs, who has released singles with record labels such as MFS and Superstition.

Lloyd also postulates that the universe can be fully simulated using a quantum computer; however, in the absence of a theory of quantum gravity, such a simulation is not yet possible. ==Reaction== Reviewer Corey S.

He was elected at the state convention held in San Antonio on June 3, 2006, to succeed the term-limited David Barton from Aledo in Parker County west of Fort Worth. Armstrong defeated Internet grassroots organizer, Bobby Eberle of Pearland near Houston. In April 2020, Mr. Armstrong garnered controversy by utilizing his personal political connections to conduct a non- clinical study over the effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine, a long-used anti- malarial medication that had recently been given Emergency Use Authorization by the FDA for use on COVID-19 patients, but remains politically controversial because of Trump's announced support for its use. ==Background== Armstrong was born in Texas City and reared in nearby La Marque in Galveston County. He has a bachelor's degree in microbiology from Texas A&M; University in College Station and a medical degree from the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston. He did his residency in internal medicine. He is on the staff of Mainland Medical Center in Texas City. The hospital is located down the street from his boyhood home. He was the 2006 president of the Galveston County Medical Society. He graduated from La Marque High School, at which he was a wide receiver on the Cougars football team that played in the 5A state championship in 1987; he also ran the 800 meters and the two-mile relay in track and field. Armstrong became a Christian during his sophomore year at Texas A&M; and has traveled on missionary journeys to Africa and Nicaragua. He has worked in inner city and youth ministry at his church, the Abundant Life Christian Center in La Marque, Texas, where he leads a men’s Bible study group. ==Political career== On June 14, 2008, Armstrong was elected to a second term as vice chairman at the state Republican convention held in Houston. Tina Benkiser, a Houston attorney, was elected to her third full term as state party chairman. Under Texas law, each major party must at all times have a woman as either its chairman or vice chairman. One of the two positions must be held by a man. Benkiser resigned as chairman on October 5, 2009, to join the reelection campaign of Governor Rick Perry. Under party rules, the chairman must remain neutral in primary election campaigns. Perry faced a challenge from U.S. Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison in the Republican primary held on March 2, 2010. Benkiser was succeeded by Cathie Adams, a conservative activist and Republican national committeewoman from Plano. Adams was elected to fill the position by the Republican State Executive Committee at a special meeting at party headquarters in Austin. She served until the state convention held on June 12, 2010, when she was unseated by Steve Munisteri of Houston. At the 2006 convention, Texas Republicans affirmed their opposition to affirmative action in their state platform and then chose Armstrong, who is African-American, as vice chairman. Armstrong has been active in the grassroots of the GOP, as a city chair, an election judge, a precinct chair, a poll watcher, a convention delegate, a Senatorial District Convention chairman, and most recently as the State Republican Executive committeeman for Texas Senate District 11, which covers parts of Galveston, Harris, and Brazoria counties. He is a member of the Galveston Pachyderm Club, and the Texas Eagle Forum. He opposes abortion. He was reared in a political household. His father, Robert Armstrong, was a member of the nonpartisan La Marque Independent School Board. Armstrong said that he hoped to see the United States stop its \\"drifting away from the values that made her great.\\" According to Armstrong, the GOP must \\"expand our conservative base to maintain our party's success in the future. It is not enough to preach to the choir; we must continue to grow by reaching out to people of faith, professional groups, and minorities who have been abandoned by liberalism.\\" Armstrong said that he would work closely with Benkiser to win the \\"cultural war\\" and to secure GOP majorities into the future. In March 2015, Armstrong, along with Jared Woodfill of Harris County and Wade Emmert, chairman of Dallas County, was an unsuccessful candidate for state Republican chairman. The 62-member Republican Executive Committee instead chose Tom Mechler of Amarillo to fill the position on the third secret ballot in a special meeting in Austin. The vacancy occurred when Steve Munisteri stepped down to become a consultant to U.S. Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky. Mechler and Cathie Adams had lost the chairmanship race to Munisteri at the 2010 convention in Dallas. In 2017, Mechler resigned as chairman. ==Personal life== Armstrong and his wife Martha, who is also a medical doctor, have four sons. ==ReferencesExternal links== * Article about Robin Armstrong's election as Vice–Chairman (with photos) Category:1969 births Category:Living people Category:African-American Christians Category:African-American physicians Category:Physicians from Texas Category:African-American people in Texas politics Category:Politicians from Houston Category:People from Texas City, Texas Category:Texas A&M; University alumni Category:Texas Republicans Category:University of Texas Medical Branch alumni Category:American anti-abortion activists Category:Republican National Committee members Category:Activists from Houston Category:People from La Marque, Texas Category:People from Dickinson, Texas ","title":"Robin Armstrong"},{"id":"5563146","text":"The Story So Far is a documentary film featuring the rock band, New Found Glory. ==Content== The Story So Far *Opening *The Beginning 97-99 *Tour Life *Europe *Australia *Recording *Behind the Scenes *The Story So Far Videos *Dressed To Kill *Hit Or Miss *My Friends Over You *Head On Collision *Hit Or Miss (Original Drive-Thru Video) Bonus Content *Bonus NFG Feature, filmed and produced by Fade Front Left Video Magazine (Running time 44:46) *Drive-Thru Commercial Category:2002 films Category:New Found Glory albums ","title":"The Story So Far (2002 film)"},{"id":"5563147","text":"The Saddle Club is a series of intermediate children's books published by Bantam Books between 1988 and 2001. The series was created by a publishing house using the contract writing services of self-professed equestrian novice Bonnie Bryant. Many titles were also written by ghostwriters. Spin-offs include four other book series: The Saddle Club Super Editions, The Saddle Club Inside Stories, Pony Tails, and Pine Hollow. The books were adapted into a TV show also called The Saddle Club. In the 1990s, there was also a fan club with a monthly newsletter and a line of model horses manufactured by Breyer. The books follow the adventures of best friends Carole Hanson, Stevie Lake, and Lisa Atwood, who live in the fictional town of Willow Creek, Virginia, and ride at Pine Hollow Stables. In the first book of the series, Horse Crazy, Carole and Lisa help Stevie with her mathematics project, which launches the girls' friendship and the titular club. At the beginning of the series, Carole and Stevie are twelve-year-old seventh-graders and Lisa is a thirteen-year-old eighth-grader. Although the characters live through several vacations and years of school, they do not age until the \\"Pine Hollow\\" series. ==Structure of the Books== The Saddle Club is written in a third-person style. In early books, the narration was third-person limited and shifted from character to character, often offering more insight into the thoughts and feelings of the Saddle Club members and their friends; in later books, the narrative style became much more omniscient. ==Titles== * For a complete list of titles, see List of Saddle Club books. ==Main characters==  Carole Hanson * First appearance: #1, Horse Crazy, * Age: 12 * Family: Father Mitch Hanson, a Colonel in the United States Marine Corps; mother Jeanne Hanson, a real estate agent who died from cancer when Carole was 11; a black cat from the stables who she names Snowball because he is so contrary. * Horse(s): Starlight, originally called Pretty Boy. A bay half-Thoroughbred gelding who's registered name is Pretty Boy Floyd, that she receives as a Christmas present from the money her mother left her in #13, Starlight Christmas. Carole planned to buy the black colt Samson and sell Starlight in the \\"Pine Hollow\\" series, but she couldn't because Colonel Hanson grounded his daughter for cheating on her history test after Carole's grades slipped due to focusing on Samson instead of school. * Education: The Saddle Club: A 7th grader at Willow Creek Junior High School, a public school she attends with Lisa. Pine Hollow: Junior at Willow Creek High School, the local high school that she and Lisa go to. * Personality: Carole is the best, most experienced, and most serious rider of the three; she began riding when she was four. Stable owner Max Regnery selected her as the best overall junior rider in #6, Dude Ranch. She is very organized as far as horses are concerned, but she can be scatterbrained regarding anything else. She tends to be a know-it-all at times, but sometimes it is very helpful. Carole has never fully forgiven Veronica for causing Cobalt's death. Stephanie \\"Stevie\\" Lake * First appearance: #1, Horse Crazy * Age: 12 * Family: Father, a lawyer; mother Catherine, also a lawyer; older brother Chad, 14; twin brother Alex, 12; younger brother Michael, 9; a cat named Madonna. * Horse(s): Belle, a dark bay Arabian cross Saddlebred mare whom she receives in \\"Horse Trade\\" and legally owns in \\"Gift Horse\\". She also almost bought Stewball, the skewbald gelding she rides at her friend Kate Devine's dude ranch, in \\"Horse Tale\\". * Education: The Saddle Club: A 7th grader at Fenton Hall, a private academy she attends with her brothers and Veronica. Pine Hollow: Junior at Fenton Hall with Alex, Michael, and Veronica. * Personality: Stevie began riding when she was eight. She is the least serious of the three and the most disorganized. Stevie dropped her given name, Stephanie, almost before she could talk and has always been a bit tomboyish. Now being uncomfortable with the activities other girls of her age do, but at the same time getting tired of being \\"one of the boys,\\" one thing remains: her love of horses. She excels at practical jokes, one of which is her first interaction with Lisa. Ironically, one of her strongest skills is dressage, a precise type of riding that requires great subtlety and poise. Stable owner, Max Regnery, selected her as the best overall junior rider in Super Edition #3, Western Star. She is the only one who has a steady boyfriend, Phil. Stevie is the only girl in her family, and her feuds with her brothers are a major element of most of the series; her brothers love to tease her about Phil. Elizabeth \\"Lisa\\" Atwood * First appearance: #1, Horse Crazy * Age: 13 * Family: Father, Richard, 42; mother, Eleanor; brother, Peter, 21, who is at college or studying abroad for most of the series; Lhasa apso dog named Dolly; step-mom, Evelyn; half sister, Lily; aunt/godmother, Elizabeth; great aunt, Madge. Lisa's parents are divorced as of \\"Stray Horse\\". Mr. Atwood moves into an apartment so that Lisa can live with him during the weekend until he moves to California. Evelyn eventually gives birth to a baby girl named Lily before the start of the \\"Pine Hollow\\" series. * Horse(s): Lisa never owns her own horse, although her parents once considered buying her a horse. In #11, Horse Wise, they view a horse called \\"Pretty Boy,\\" but Lisa knew she was not ready to own one. Lisa eventually told Carole Hanson about the horse and she ended up buying him, changing his name to Starlight. In the Pine Hollow series, Lisa's father makes plans to buy Prancer for her, a retired Thoroughbred racehorse who she rides throughout most of the series. However, Prancer dies during a difficult pregnancy, as do both of her twin foals, in Riding To Win, the ninth book of the Pine Hollow series. * Education: The Saddle Club: An 8th grader at Willow Creek Junior High School, the public school she attends with Carole. Pine Hollow: Senior at Willow Creek High School, the local high school that she and Carole go to. * Personality: Lisa is the oldest of the three but the newest rider; she begins in #1, Horse Crazy because her mother thinks that every young lady should know something about horses. She is extremely organized, a straight-A student, and a perfectionist. Although stable owner, Max, often tells her that she has potential, her desire to \\"catch up\\" to Carole and Stevie is an element of most of the series. Lisa is shorter than Carole and Stevie. Lisa was named after her Aunt Elizabeth. * Inconsistencies: Lisa's brother is mentioned peripherally in two early books -- #1, Horse Crazy, in which Lisa's mother wouldn't let Lisa borrow a tie from him, and #7, Horse Play, in which he's at summer camp. Since Peter is eight years older than Lisa and living away from home for the rest of the series, it is likely that these are errors. Maximilian \\"Max\\" Regnery III * First appearance: #1, Horse Crazy * Family: Grandfather, Maxmilian, who founded Pine Hollow Stables, deceased; father, Maxmilian II, deceased; mother, Eliaeth, who is known as \\"Mrs. Reg\\"; wife, Deborah Hale Regnery, a newspaper reporter who he marries in Sable Grom; oldest daughter, Maxine \\"Maxi\\" Hale Regnery, who is born in Super Edition #5, Before They Rode Horses; youngest daughter, Jeanne \\"Minnie\\" Regnry, who first appears in the Pine Hollow series. * Horse(s): Max owns about 25 horses at the start of the series, a number that grows over the course of the books. * Personality: Max owns the stable and also teaches classes for riders of all ages. He requires that all students not only ride but also take care of their horses, clean tack, get good grades in school, and perform chores around the stable; he believes that these are all part of what it means to ride. If the kids grades drop below a C average Max won't allow them to ride until their grades improve. In addition to being a respected teacher, he is also an accomplished rider. * Inconsistencies: Max's full name has been spelled Maxmillian, Maximillian, and Maximilian at various points in the series. Elizabeth \\"Mrs. Reg\\" Regnery * First appearance: #1, Horse Crazy * Family: Father-in-law, Maxmilian, who founded Pine Hollow Stables, deceased; husband, Maxmilian II, deceased; son, Maxmilian \\"Max\\" III; daughter- in-law, Deborah Hale; granddaughter, Maxine \\"Maxi\\" Hale Regnery; granddaughter Jeanne \\"Minnie/Mini\\" Regnery. * Horse(s): It is implied that when Max II died, he left the stable to his son, not his wife. Mrs. Reg rides frequently, but does not own her own personal horse. She often rides the white Arabian gelding Barq. * Personality: Mrs. Reg manages the stable, schedules classes, and coordinates orders and special events. She dislikes seeing people stand around with nothing to do and often assigns them odd jobs if they aren't already working. She is also famous for telling stories that are seemingly unrelated to the situations that The Saddle Club finds itself in. Mrs. Reg retires to Florida before the start of the Pine Hollow series. Veronica diAngelo * First appearance: #1, Horse Crazy * Family: Father, a banker and the richest man in Willow Creek; mother, a prominent social figure; multiple dogs, including two black labradors, a poodle named Robespierre, and a puppy named Sugarlump. * Horse(s): Princess, a pony that she owned when she was 11 before the series started; Cobalt, a black Thoroughbred stallion who is put down as a result of her carelessness in #2, Horse Shy; Garnet, a chestnut Arabian mare that her parents buy for her in #11, Horse Wise; Go For Blue \\"Danny\\", a well- trained, schoolmaster dapple grey Thoroughbred gelding that her parents buy for her in #49, Stable Farewell. * Education: A 7th-grader at Fenton Hall, a private academy where she attends with Stevie and Stevie's brothers. * Personality: Veronica is an extremely spoiled Italian American girl. She acts as The Saddle Club's perpetual enemy, particularly Stevie's, since the girls attend the same school. Veronica always has the latest clothes and doesn't approve of The Saddle Club's simpler style. Earlier books are more generous toward Veronica, suggesting that she acts badly because her parents have little time for her and often agree to buy her something as a means of solving problems. Veronica's character suggests that she would love to be part of The Saddle Club, but chooses to keep people at arm's length from her. She doesn't seem like she can trust people as she's been let down by her own parents many times. Her spoiled exterior seems like a cover for her true feelings. Veronica cried when she sold Garnet in #49, Stable Farewell, indicating that she really cared about her even though she fussed over Danny and took care of him. ==Recurring characters== * Dr. Judy Barker - equine veterinarian who treats most Pine Hollow horses. First appears in #3, Horse Sense. * John Brightstar - son of Walter Brightstar, a wrangler at the Bar None Ranch. First appears in #24, Ghost Rider.

The Saddle Club Super Edition books also focus on Carole, Lisa, and Stevie, but are longer and occasionally written in a different style. For example, Super Edition #1, A Summer Without Horses, is broken into four sections, and the first three are about Lisa, Stevie, and Carole's personal experiences. Other Super Editions follow the same third-person narrative style of the regular series. For more information about the Super Editions, see the List of Saddle Club books. The Inside Story books are written as diaries or journals. In each, the premise is that the title character - Stevie, Lisa, or Carole - is doing a project or writing a journal that requires her to explain her impressions of events in regular The Saddle Club books that involved all three girls. The Inside Story books are longer than the Super Editions. For more information about the Inside Story books, see the List of Saddle Club books. The Pony Tails books are a spinoff series aimed at young readers ages 7–10. They focus on May Grover, Corey Takamura, and Jasmine James, who are also riders at Pine Hollow and form their own club called the Pony Tails. The Pine Hollow books are a spinoff series aimed at teen and young adult readers. They focus on the same characters four years later, beginning during the summer before Lisa's senior year of high school and Carole and Stevie's junior year. Many characters from the Saddle Club books reappear in the Pine Hollow series, and two major new characters—Scott and Callie Forester—were introduced. The last Pine Hollow book, #17, Full Gallop, was written in 2001 and is chronologically the last book in the Saddle Club canon. In 1990, a short story called Happy Horse Day! was published along with a short story in the Fabulous Five series by Betsy Haynes. The book was included in a Jean Nate gift set of bath products for girls. TV series In 2001, The Saddle Club was adapted into a TV series called The Saddle Club, which was filmed and set in Australia. There are notable differences between the characters and plotlines in the books and the TV series. The show ran for three seasons and has been broadcast on ABC and FOX8 in Australia, on Discovery Kids and public television in the United States, on YTV network in Canada, and on PopGirl in the UK. Episodes are available on DVD. ==ReferencesExternal links== * The Saddle Club Category:Series of children's books Category:American children's novels Category:American young adult novels Category:Young adult novel series Category:Novels set in Virginia Category:BILBY Award-winning works Category:Bantam Books books Category:Pony books ","title":"The Saddle Club (books)"},{"id":"5563161","text":"Muhammad Jalal ud-din Khan Nawab Sir Muhammad Jalaluddin Khan (2 April 1889 – 4 December 1936) was the Nawab of Radhanpur, in British India.

He lives and works mainly in the Shetland Islands. Morton’s most recent publication was the book he wrote jointly with his son James, Shetland: Cooking on the Edge of the World (Quadrille, 2018). He currently hosts a weekly internet radio show called The Beatcroft Social. A weekly columnist for local newspaper The Shetland Times, he writes about whisky and hosts podcasts for the online magazine Discover Scotland. Until April 2015, Morton presented a BBC Radio Scotland show, broadcast Friday, Saturday and Sunday nights, from 10:00 pm to 1:00 am, a Scottish take on rock and pop from obscure blues to mainstream pop and soul and current independent releases. He has written several books, including a biography of the Gaelic rock band Runrig, a whisky travelogue called Spirit of Adventure, and several critically acclaimed novels. A spy novel called Serpentine was published in the UK in 2009 and in the US and Canada the following year. For many years, he worked as a print journalist, as a columnist with the Daily and Sunday Express, Scotland on Sunday, The Big Issue in Scotland, The Shetland Times, and as a staff reporter with national newspaper The Scotsman. He was the first non-DC Thomson employee to script the legendary Sunday Post cartoon strips The Broons and Oor Wullie – something he did for 12 months in 2005 and 2006. A Whisky in Monsterville, \\"the first interactive malt whisky novel\\", was published in August 2013 by Looderhorn Books. From November 2011 until January 2015 he edited the magazine Shetland Life. ==Early life== Born in Carlisle, England, but brought up by his Scottish family in Glasgow and Troon, Ayrshire, Morton's early years were characterised by committed evangelical Christianity, which he alluded to in the novel Red Guitars in Heaven. Heavily involved in religious music during the 1970s and early 1980s, he released several albums and toured as a full-time evangelical singer. This period of Morton's life ended in 1984: a change referenced in several of his books. ==Career== Morton wrote reviews and features for the defunct rock weekly Melody Maker and produced and presented religious TV. Moving to the Shetland Islands in 1987, he was appointed news editor of The Shetland Times, and formed the islands' first freelance news agency. For four years he wasHighlands and Islands Reporter with The Scotsman before a return to Shetland and more freelance work. TV work includes the Discovery Home and Leisure series Village Green, about ecological housing, and three series of the STV motoring programme Wheelnutsin the 1990s. Around this time he wrote and presented the ITV Network productions The Rock that Doesn't Roll and The Rock That Rolled Away. A golf feature, The Old Course, is on DVD. He has written scripts for some TV and many radio programmes. Morton began working in radio in 1992 on BBC Radio Scotland. In 2006, he released a CD of original musical material, mainly self-conscious meditations on the perils of being an ageing rock'n'roll fan. He blogs regularly. Morton used ISDN digital telephone technology to broadcast on Radio Scotland from his home in the Shetland Islands. For several years his radio show came mostly from The Radiocroft, an ISDN-equipped crofthouse in the remote north of Shetland's Mainland. However, in December 2008, after months of unreliability, the local exchange was struck by lightning during a broadcast and his show went off air. After this, the station moved the show to the BBC local radio station BBC Radio Shetland in Lerwick. During frequent visits to the UK mainland, the show came from BBC studios in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Dundee, Aberdeen, Oban, Inverness, Wick, Ayr, Tunbridge Wells, Stranraer and other temporary ISDN linked studios. Since April 2013, broadcast once again from his home, using a mixture of ISDN and audio-over-IP, specifically software called Luci Live. In 2015, Morton stepped down from his BBC Radio Scotland show, citing heart problems.\\"Tom Morton stepping down from BBC Radio Scotland show\\" - BBC Radio Scotland, 13 May 2015 ==Recent ventures== Morton returned to live performance with the Malt and Barley Revue, a musical show about whisky. He blogs about alcohol on Drinking for Scotland. A novel, Serpentine, set in Palestine, Scotland and Northern Ireland, was published in June 2009 by Mainstream Publishing. He co-wrote the privately 2009-published book Journey's Blend, about a charity motorcycle trip around Scotland's most geographically extreme distilleries. Morton has done public relations and social media consultancy in Scotland, presented live debates, workshops and seminars, including the Belladrum \\"Tartan Heart\\" Festival. Working with Glasgow-based events and promotion company Fairpley, he set up a \\"Barnard Challenge\\" whisky tour and the \\"Mull to Muckle\\" long distance cycle ride, publicising the charities Spirit Aid and the Scottish Fair Trade Forum. During 2011, Morton provided PR consultancy on developing a communications strategy for Shetland Islands Council. He also wrote the text for an acclaimed \\"Shetland – the brand\\" campaign and continues to provide social media and copywriting services to Promote Shetland. In November 2011 he took over from Malachy Tallack as editor of the magazine Shetland Life, resigning in January 2015. His 2013 novel A Whisky in Monsterville claimed to be \\"The World's First Interactive Whisky Thriller\\", available as a paperback and Kindle e-book. He produced all the content for Promote Shetland's Power From the North promotional magazines, aimed at increasing awareness of Shetland's involvement for energy production and related fields, and ran the social media campaign. For a year from June 2016, he presented a weekly live internet music radio show to accompany Promote Shetland's live coastal webcam feeds, streamed on Facebook, Periscope and on the 60 North servers. The show in audio only is still available weekly via Mixcloud. In June 2017 Morton published the book In Shetland: Tales from the Last Bookshop. ==ReferencesExternal links== *BBC Radio Scotland – Tom Morton *From the Beatcroft, Shetland Isles – Tom Morton's blog Category:1955 births Category:Living people Category:People from Carlisle, Cumbria Category:Scottish bloggers Category:Scottish biographers Category:Scottish evangelicals Category:Scottish journalists Category:Scottish writers about music Category:Scottish public relations people Category:Scottish radio personalities Category:Scottish radio presenters Category:Scottish television presenters Category:Scottish travel writers Category:Melody Maker writers Category:People from Shetland Category:Shetland music Category:Scottish comics writers ","title":"Tom Morton"},{"id":"5563189","text":"Adidas Tricolore was the official match ball of 1998 FIFA World Cup in France.

Made by Adidas, it was the first multi-coloured ball to be used in the tournament's final stage and was also the final World Cup ball to bear the classic Tango design, introduced in the 1978 tournament.

It is found in the Iberian peninsula, in northwestern Africa and in coastal districts in Languedoc-Roussillon in France. In Spanish, this lizard is commonly called lagartija Ibérica. ==Description== The Iberian wall lizard varies considerably in size and colouring across its range. It is a fairly small, slender, somewhat flattened species with a snout-to-vent length (SVL) averaging and a tail twice as long as its body. The background colour is usually grey or brown but is occasionally greenish. Most individuals have three narrow longitudinal stripes, one along the spine and the other two more distinct and on either side. Sometimes these are broken up into a series of streaks or marks. Some males instead have a reticulated (netlike) pattern and others are more uniform in colour. The throat is pale with a scattering of small spots, particularly near the sides, and the belly is usually whitish but may be pink, orange, red or buff. Young lizards may have blue tails. ==Distribution and habitat== The Iberian wall lizard forms part of a species complex of Podarcis wall lizards occurring in the Iberian Peninsula and the Maghreb region of North Africa. The range map shows the boundaries between the species and includes P. bocagei, P. vaucheri, P. muralis, P. carbonelli and several different subspecies of P. hispanica. Several different subspecies of the Iberian wall lizard are found in Spain and Portugal (where it is the only small lizard over most of the southern half of Iberia), southwestern France, Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia. A subspecies of this lizard, Podarcis hispanica atrata, lives in the Columbretes Islands far off the eastern coast of the Iberian Peninsula. Studies of mitochondrial DNA have shown that there is some gene flow between these species and that they hybridise to some extent where their ranges meet. It is a climbing lizard and is found on rocks, cliffs, walls, parapets, road cuttings and occasionally tree trunks at altitudes of up to . ==Biology== The Iberian wall lizard is very agile and can move rapidly across a rock face. Males are somewhat territorial. Females lay clutches of one to five oval eggs which hatch in about eight weeks. At birth, the juveniles have a snout-to-vent length of . The lifespan of this lizard is about four years. ==Status== The Iberian wall lizard has a wide range and is common over much of that range. It is assumed to have a large total population, it is able to adapt to modifications of its habitat and it faces no particular threats, so the International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed its conservation status as being of \\"least concern\\". == References == * hispanicus Category:Lizards of Europe Category:Reptiles described in 1870 Category:Taxa named by Franz Steindachner ","title":"Podarcis hispanicus"},{"id":"5563232","text":"Dance To The Radio is a British independent record label, based in Leeds, England. ==History== It was named after the refrain of the Joy Division song \\"Transmission\\".

It is a large and mixed neighborhood, with communist era style highrise apartments sprinkled between decently kept one house residential streets. Városliget, the City Park is located at the western part of the district. Its popularity comes from the fact that it has leafy suburb style neighbourhoods closest to the city center. ==Geography== * Area 18.15 km2 * Inhabitants: 130,000 Access to the district is easy; the southern end is easily accessible with the main M2 subway line, with its terminal station being the largest hub in the city at the border with Kőbánya. The northern part is accessible with the old M1 subway line. ==History== Parts of Rákosmező is thought to be part of Zugló now; this was the ground for the inaugurational process for the king at times in Hungarian history dating back to the 13th century. The development of the area started in the middle of the 19th century as Pest expanded. The subway (the first subway in continental Europe outside London) reached the district at the end of the 19th century. The first mansions were built around the City Park. As the city expanded, the suburban district quickly found itself fairly central in the city, and larger houses started to appear in certain areas. The Communist era brought large developments of pre-fab housing projects into some areas of the district, but large parts of the district still maintain the suburban feeling; and some areas even retained the glamour of the mansions built at the turn of the century. ==Demographics== Zugló is considered to be amongst the 'nicest' and safest districts of the Pest side of the city, which also means that in most areas of the district, people are somewhat better off than the average of their class, meaning the block buildings are cleaner, houses are nicer, etc. Zugló is a mixture of middle and working-class people. Occasionally non-European immigrants can also be seen in Zugló. The district is favored for its good transportation, safety and for being clean as well. The district sees considerable new development of condos and is a favorite destination of young middle-class families. ==Sport== *Budapesti AK (football) *BVSC Budapest (football) *BVSC (men's water polo) *Budapesti Postás SE, sports team *Turul FC, defunct football team *Zuglói AC, defunct football team *Zuglói SE, defunct football team ==List of mayors== { class= - ! colspan=2  Member !

Stories say that he lived at a place called Piti, northeast of present-day Douala. From there, his sons migrated south toward the coast in what are known as the Mbedine events. These movements may be mythical in many cases, but anthropologists and historians accept the plausibility of a migration of some Sawa ancestors to the coast during the 16th century. ==Narrative and historicity== According to Sawa oral history, Mbedi, the son of Mbongo, lived at Piti on the Dibamba River, northeast of present-day Douala. He was the father of Bojongo, Dibongo, Ewale, and several others. For reasons that vary with the tale, Mbedi's sons left him and migrated south to the coast. Often, this is ascribed to a family conflict, such as one between Mbedi and Ewale over imported European cloth.Austen and Derrick 10. Another tale says that the sons wanted to trade directly with European merchants on the coast.Ardener and Ardener 352. The sons migrated south, parting company at various points. Each man became the founder of a different ethnic group. Based on records of Dutch traders, the first known Duala ruler was a man the merchants dubbed Monneba, who lived at the present site of Douala in the 16th century. Ardener and others suggest that Monneba was in fact Mulobe, the son of Ewale and grandson of Mbedi according to Duala tradition. This would place Mbedi's lifetime in the late 16th century.Ardener 27-8. The stories about Mbedi lack any of the heroics of other founder stories. The only other figure who is shared by so many Sawa ethnic groups is Jeki la Njambè, an epic character who is almost certainly mythical. Therefore, historians and anthropologists find Mbedi's existence to be completely plausible.Austen and Derrick 9, 14. The migrations of Mbedi's sons, known as the Mbedine events, seem more questionable.Ardener 28. The Sawa claims of descent from Mbedi may simply reflect the hegemony of the Duala people during early contact with Europeans and the colonial period. The Duala were the elites of the day, so other peoples may simply have adopted the Duala origin myths and claimed kinship through brothers of the Duala's founder, Ewale a Mbedi. Some of these, such as the Bakweri, Bakole, and Limba, speak languages closely related to Duala, so the proposed kinship is not difficult to accept. However, even Sawa whose language more resembles that of the Bassa and Bakoko claim descent from Mbedi, lending this hypothesis some feasibility.Austen and Derrick 14. ==NotesReferences== *Ardener, Edwin (1996).

Charles \\"Charlie\\" Dean (aged 24) was the brother of future Vermont politician and Democratic National Committee Chairman Howard Dean, Democracy for America Chairman Jim Dean, and political activist Bill Dean. Neil Sharman (aged 23), was a journalist taking time off from his career to see the world. The two were captured and killed by the Communist Pathet Lao guerrillas. Because he was CIA, Dean was regarded by the United States government as a prisoner of war. On 14 November 2003, Dean's remains were repatriated to the United States, and Sharman's were repatriated to Australia.US returning remains of war victims: [1 State Edition] The Daily Telegraph (Sydney) 24 November 2003. ==Charles Dean== Dean grew up in Manhattan and worked summers as a volunteer counselor with Boys Harbor.Friend Recalls Young Deans, Ellis Henican, Newsday, 10 Dec 2003: A04. Dean graduated from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill where he was active in student government and the anti-war movement in 1972. In 1972, he went on to work as the Orange County, North Carolina coordinator for Democrat George S. McGovern's 1972 presidential campaign. In 1973 Dean traveled to Japan by freighter, then to Australia where he worked on a station (equivalent to a US ranch) for 9 months. While there he met Australian journalist Neil Sharman. In 1974, the two traveled to Laos to visit a friend of the Dean family who worked for USAID. Together with Sharman, Dean stayed in a bungalow on the Mekong River, planning to meet another friend who was serving in the Peace Corps in Nepal. In early September 1974, Dean and Sharman took a raft down the Mekong River to Thailand. They were stopped at a checkpoint near a small village called Pak Him Boun, two miles southeast of the capital of Laos, Vientiane, by Pathet Lao communist guerrillas who imprisoned the two, apparently believing they were spies because they were carrying cameras. Dean's parents traveled to Laos where they met with Premier Souvanna Phouma and Prime Minister Prince Souphanouvong in May 1975 in an effort to obtain the release of Dean and Sharman. The U.S. government demanded the release of both Dean and Sharman. Dean was classified as a POW-MIA although he was a civilian, leading to speculation that he was working for the Central Intelligence Agency. According to Howard Dean, his parents believed this to be true, though Howard Dean does not and the CIA says it has no records that Charles Dean was ever in their employ. A memorial service was held for Dean at St. Luke's Episcopal Church in Easthampton, New York, in the year following his presumed death. ==Neil Sharman== Neil Sharman, was a young Australian who had previously worked as a journalist for the Sydney Morning Herald was working for the Northern Territory News when he wrote to tell his brother in 1973 that he was taking a backpack and heading off to see \\"Indonesia, Malaysia, India and all places in between. Maybe the Arab countries (If we can without being shot).\\" Sharman's girlfriend, Joy Hooper, who had been travelling with the two men, searched desperately for information on the two, questioning government officials across the region for several months before returning home to Australia.Louella Bryant While in Darkness There Is Light: Idealism and Tragedy on an Australian Commune 1480425826 2013 \\"... when Charlie met Neil Sharman, he felt as if he had known the Australian for years.

In 2000, accounts given by people who had seen the two young men killed enabled the identification of the site where Dean and Sharman were believed to have been buried. Examination of the remains after their 2003 recovery showed that the two young men had been handcuffed and shot. ==Repatriation of remains== On 11 November 2003. Howard Dean confirmed that a joint Laotian-US task force had discovered remains thought to be those of his younger brother, and DNA analysis subsequently confirmed that the remains were Charles Dean's. In May 2004, Charles Dean's remains were buried, with his three brothers and his mother in attendance. Dean's death has been widely reported by Howard Dean as having had a major influence on his life; on most days, he wears a black leather belt that once belonged to Charles Dean. ==ReferencesFurther reading== *Dr. Howard Dean, Winning Back America (Simon & Schuster, 2003) . ==External links== *Excerpt from Winning Back America *POW-MIA InterNetwork Category:Year of birth missing Category:1974 deaths Category:American people murdered abroad Category:Australian people murdered abroad Category:Australia–Laos relations Category:Laos–United States relations Category:People murdered in Laos Category:Communism in Laos Category:1974 in Laos ","title":"Killing of Charles Dean and Neil Sharman"},{"id":"5563288","text":"Henry Louis Vivian Derozio (18 April 1809 – 26 December 1831), was an Indian poet of English and Portuguese origin and assistant headmaster of Hindu College, Kolkata. He was a radical thinker of his time and one of the first Indian educators to disseminate Western learning and science among the young men of Bengal. Long after his death (by cholera), his legacy lived on among his former students, who came to be known as Young Bengal and many of whom became prominent in social reform, law, and journalism. ==Biography== Early life Henry Louis Vivian Derozio was born on 18 April 1809 at Entally- Padmapukur in Kolkata. His parents were Francis Derozio, a Christian Indo- Portuguese office worker, and Sophia Johnson Derozio, an Englishwoman. His original family name was 'De Rozario'. Derozio attended David Drummond Dharmatala Academy school from age 6 to 14. He later praised his early schooling for its liberal approach to education, particularly its unusual choice to teach Indian, Eurasian and European children from different social classes together as peers. Derozio's later religious skepticism is sometimes attributed to David Drummond, who was known as a freethinker. Derozio was a successful student: notices in the India Gazette and the Calcutta Journal at the time mentioned Derozio's academic excellence (including several academic prizes) and successful performances in student plays. While a student, he read the poetry of his contemporaries, John Keats, Percy Shelley, and Lord Byron. At age 14, Derozio left school to work. He initially joined his father's office in Kolkata, then shifted to his uncle's indigo factory in Bhagalpur. Inspired by the scenic beauty of the banks of the River Ganges, he started writing poetry, which he submitted to the India Gazette. His poetic career began to flourish, with poems published in multiple newspapers and periodicals, in 1825. In 1827, when Derozio was 18, the editor John Grant took notice of his s poetry, offering to publish a book of his work and inviting him to return to Kolkata. He soon became an assistant editor for Grant, as well as publishing in several other periodicals, and founding his own newspaper, the Calcutta Gazette. Hindu College and Young Bengals In May 1826, at age 17, he was appointed teacher in English literature and history at the new Hindu College. Derozio's intense zeal for teaching and his interactions with students created a sensation at Hindu College. He organized debates where ideas and social norms were freely debated. In 1828, he motivated students to form a literary and debating club called the Academic Association. This was a time when Hindu society in Bengal was undergoing considerable turmoil. In 1828, Raja Ram Mohan Roy established the Brahmo Samaj, which kept Hindu ideals but denied idolatry. This resulted in a backlash within orthodox Hindu society. Derozio helped discuss the ideas for social change already in the air. Despite his youth, he was considered a great scholar and a thinker. Within a short period, he drew around him a group of intelligent boys in college. He constantly encouraged them to think freely, to question, and not to accept anything blindly. His teachings inspired the development of the spirit of liberty, equality, and freedom. They also tried to remove social evils, improve the condition of women and peasants, and promote liberty through freedom of the press, trial by jury, and so on. His activities brought about the intellectual revolution in Bengal. It was called the Young Bengal Movement and his students, also known as Derozians, were fiery patriots. Due to backlash from conservative parents who disliked his wide-ranging and open discussion of religious issues, Derozio was dismissed from his post in April 1831, shortly before his death. In 1838, after his death, members of the Young Bengal movement established a second society called the Society for the Acquisition of General Knowledge. Its main objective was to acquire and disseminate knowledge about the condition of the country. Death Derozio died of cholera at age 22 on 26 December 1831 in Calcutta. His body was buried in South Park Street Cemetery. ==Writing== Derozio was generally considered an Anglo-Indian, being of mixed Portuguese, Indian, and English descent, but he considered himself Indian. He was known during his lifetime as the first 'national' poet of modern India, and the history of Anglo-Indian poetry typically begins with him. His poems are regarded as an important landmark in the history of patriotic poetry in India, especially \\"To India - My Native Land\\" and The Fakeer of Jungheera. He is influenced by Romantic poetry, especially the orientalism of poets like Lord Byron and Robert Southey.

Shah (1907) ** \\"To the Pupils of the Hindu College\\" ==Influence== upright=.6 Derizio's ideas had a profound influence on the social movement that came to be known as the Bengal Renaissance in early 19th century Bengal, despite being viewed as something of an iconoclast by Alexander Duff and other (largely evangelical) Christian Missionaries. In Duff's Assembly's Institution, Derozio's ideas on the acceptance of the rational spirit were accepted, as long as they were not in conflict with basic tenets of Christianity, and as long as they critiqued orthodox Hinduism. Derozio is generally believed to be partly responsible for the conversion of upper-caste Hindus like Krishna Mohan Banerjee and Lal Behari Dey to Christianity. Samaren Roy, however, states that only three Hindu pupils among his first group of students became Christians, and asserts that Derozio had no role to play in their change of faith. He points out that Derozio's dismissal was sought not only by Hindus such as Ramkamal Sen, but also by Christians such as H. H. Wilson. Many other students like Tarachand Chakraborti became leaders in the Brahmo Samaj. Derozio's political activities have also been seen as crucially important to the development of a public sphere in Calcutta during British imperialism. But the Derozians failed to create a movement because the society wasn't ready to accept his ideas at that time. They did not take up peasant's cause. They couldn't establish links with the masses. Their radicalism, though influenced by the French Revolution and Rammohun Roy's tradition, was considered bookish by some critics as they failed to come to grips with the Indian reality. Even then they educated the people in social, economic and political questions through newspapers, pamphlets , public agitations and public associations. Surendranath Banerjee, the famous moderate leader of the nationalist movement, described the Derozians, the followers of ideals of Derozio, as \\"the pioneers of the modern civilization of Bengal, the conscript fathers of our race whose virtue will excite veneration and whose failings will be treated with gentlest consideration\\". A commemorative postage stamp of Derozio was issued on December 15, 2009. ==See also== * Young Bengal * To India - My Native Land == References External links== * Derozio section * Old Poetry * Poetry of Derozio * Category:1809 births Category:1831 deaths Category:Presidency University, Kolkata alumni Category:Writers from Kolkata Category:People from Bhagalpur Category:Anglo-Indian people Category:Indian people of Portuguese descent Category:Indian male poets Category:Deaths from cholera Category:Infectious disease deaths in India Category:English-language poets from India Category:Young Bengal Category:19th-century Indian poets Category:Poets from West Bengal Category:19th-century male writers Category:Indian Christian writers ","title":"Henry Louis Vivian Derozio"},{"id":"5563293","text":"Nodaway can refer to some places in the United States: * Nodaway County, Missouri * Nodaway, Iowa * The Nodaway River, in Iowa and Missouri ==See also== *Nodaway Township (disambiguation) ","title":"Nodaway"},{"id":"5563297","text":"Takydromus tachydromoides, the Japanese grass lizard, is a wall lizard species of the genus Takydromus.

The stores were often small due to the nature of the product, and as such, were found in airports, railway stations, and shopping centres across the world. Tie Rack was founded in August 1981 by Roy Bishko. The first store opened in London at 91 Oxford Street; it was converted from a heel bar owned by Bishko from which he had trialled selling ties. The first airport store opened at Glasgow Airport in 1984 and there was a flagship store at 295 Oxford Street opposite John Lewis. At one time, there were over 330 stores in 24 countries. After a phase of consolidation, Tie Rack started to expand again in 2008/09. In July 2009 they had about 260 shops in 26 countries, and about 190 shops in at least 14 countries of the EU, with more than 1,500 employees. In 1999, the chain store was bought by Frangi SpA Group, and, at the time, benefited from this buyout by being able to sell products under the Frangi brand. In 2007 Fingen Group, Firenze, Italy got the hold of the majority stake. == Trading fascias == In 2000 and 2001, the company trialed two different fascias. This was due to Tie Rack's development into a fully fledged fashion accessories retailer. The first trial commenced in September 2000 at the Southampton store and this store was branded Le Collezioni – Tie Rack. The second trial commenced in August 2001 at the Regent Street store, with a shop fit designed by Belgian Architect Pierre Vanden Broeck, and this store was branded Frangi - Tie Rack. Both trials were rolled out to several stores, but it was eventually decided to remain trading under the Tie Rack name as this name had good brand recognition with consumers. All new and refurbished shops were branded with a refined version of the original Tie Rack logo and are sub-branded Frangi – Collezioni. In 2008 they no longer used the sub-branding, it was changed to \\"London\\". == Rolling Luggage == Rolling Luggage was a subsidiary of Tie Rack. It is a chain of around 30 stores, located exclusively in 'transport' locations, specialising in selling premium luggage on wheels. In some locations (including, for example, Glasgow Airport) there are dual-branded Tie Rack/Rolling Luggage stores. The chain is also based at the group head office in Brentford and shares many of the head office support functions with the parent chain such as IT, Finance and Human Resources. == Tumi == Tie Rack was managed in some countries' Tumi stores as a franchisee of Tumi Inc. or its daughters. == Genesis Colors Pvt Ltd == On 2 June 2009 Jacopo Fratini, Director of Tie Rack Retail Group Ltd. (and Consigliari of Fingen SpA) signed a licensing agreement with Genesis Colors Pvt Ltd. Genesis Colors intends to open 10 exclusive outlets in the first year and is aiming for 130 sales points at the end of the fifth year in India. ==Endorsees== Many celebrities endorsed the Tie Rack brand, notable businessmen including Liverpool F.C. CEO Rick Parry. ==Closure== It was announced on 19 November 2013 that Tie Rack would begin closure of the remaining 44 retail stores on 20 November 2013. ==External links== * Tie Rack Official Website * Fingen Group Official Website * Frangi S.P.A.

The name was derived from an ancient word meaning \\"the quest for the stars.\\"Questra ==History== The first ball of the family was simply named the Questra and was originally designed to be the official match ball of the 1994 FIFA World Cup in the United States. Following the convention of the addition of decorations to the established Adidas Tango style since the Azteca and the Etrusco Unico, this one featured space-themed decorations, not only due to its name, but that 1994 marked the 25th anniversary of the Apollo 11 mission in which the first moon landing took place, which is considered to be one of the most important moments in the history of the host country. Due to the popularity of that ball, there were two new editions of the Questra released in 1996. One of them was named the \\"Questra Europa\\" and was intended to be the official match ball of UEFA Euro 1996 in England, while the other one was bearing the name \\"Questra Olympia\\" and was the official match ball of the football tournament at the 1996 Summer Olympics. Both of these balls reported colours. In the development process of the Questra, Adidas tried to create a lighter and more responsive ball. By manufacturing the new ball from five different materials and enveloping it in polystyrene foam, Adidas made the Questra more waterproof and allowed for greater acceleration when kicked. Consequently, the ball became softer to touch and ball control was improved. This showed within a week of the World Cup in 1994, as players quickly adapted to the new ball and were able to score great goals by utilizing the lighter ball. However, some goalkeepers complained of the ball's unpredictability in humid weather, which made saving shots on goal particularly difficult.Questra 1994 The last edition of the Questra was the \\"Questra Apollo\\", which was used in La Liga matches and by the Spanish national team in the 1996–97 season. The Questra Apollo was identical to the original Questra from the 1994 World Cup, except for bearing the logo of the Royal Spanish Football Federation. == References External links== * Adidas ball history * Soccer Ball World's story about the Questra footballs, including pictures Questra Category:1994 FIFA World Cup Category:Products introduced in 1994 Category:UEFA Euro 1996 Category:UEFA European Championship balls ","title":"Adidas Questra"},{"id":"5563315","text":"Operation Return to Sender is the name for a massive sweep of illegal immigrants by the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency that began on May 26, 2006.

The book set forth a model with precise conditions under which economic theory could be applied to non-market political decision- making. It also suggested areas of empirical research that could be tested to confirm the validity of his conclusions in the model. Much of this offshoot research eventually became integrated into the Public Choice School. Downs' theory abstains from making normative statements about public policy choices and instead focuses on what is rational, given the relevant incentives, for government to do. ==Contents== In chapter eight of the book Downs explains how the concept of ideology is central to his theory. Depending on the ideological distribution of voters in a given political community, electoral outcomes can be stable and peaceful or wildly varied and even result in violent revolution. The likely number of political parties can also be identified if one also considers the electoral structure. If the ideological positions of voters are displayed in the form of a graph and if that graph shows a single peak, then a median voter can be identified and in a representative democracy, the choice of candidates and the choice of policies will gravitate toward the positions of the median voter. Conversely, if the graph of ideological distribution is double-peaked, indicating that most voters are either extremely liberal or extremely conservative, the tendency toward political consensus or political equilibrium is difficult to attain because legislators representing each mode are penalized by voters for attempting to achieve consensus with the other side by supporting policies representative of a middle position. Here is a list of the key propositions Downs attempts to prove in chapter eight: # A two-party democracy cannot provide stable and effective government unless there is a large measure of ideological consensus among its citizens. # Parties in a two-party system deliberately change their platforms so that they resemble one another; whereas parties in a multi-party system try to remain as ideologically distinct from each other as possible. # If the distribution of ideologies in a society's citizenry remains constant, its political system will move toward a position of equilibrium in which the number of parties and their ideological positions are stable over time. # New parties can be most successfully launched immediately after some significant change in the distribution of ideological views among eligible voters. # In a two-party system, it is rational for each party to encourage voters to be irrational by making its platform vague and ambiguous. The conditions under which his theory prevails are outlined in chapter two. Many of these conditions have been challenged by later scholarship. In anticipation of such criticism, Downs quotes Milton Friedman in chapter two that: “Theoretical models should be tested primarily by the accuracy of their predictions rather than by the reality of their assumptions” (Friedman, 1953). ==See also== * Mancur Olson ==References== * * Friedman, Milton, (1953).

Running for two series, it totalled 13 episodes and was named Alfresco (from the Italian al fresco, meaning \\"in the fresh air\\") because, unusually for a comedy sketch show of the time, it was shot on location rather than in a studio. ==Production== The programme is a sketch show which was intended as an answer to the BBC's highly successful Not the Nine O'Clock News. The main writer was Ben Elton, with Fry and Laurie receiving writing credits by the second series. Of the original team, Tony Slattery was supposed to join the cast for the three-part pilot There's Nothing to Worry About! in 1982, but accepted an offer from Chris Tarrant to join Saturday Stayback, his follow-up to O.T.T. After There's Nothing to Worry About!, which featured Elton, Fry, Laurie, Redmond, Thompson and Paul Shearer and was shown in the Granada region only,Alfresco at BFI Screenonline a first series of Alfresco was commissioned, broadcast nationally and replacing Shearer with Robbie Coltrane. The third of the seven transmitted episodes in 1983 was in fact a compilation show of the pilot series, featuring some additional material. The sketches of the first series had a very odd and surreal mood to them. In the second series in 1984 the overall style changed slightly. A linking device in form of a \\"Pretend Pub\\" was created, and the sketches themselves were less dark than in the first series. ==Recurring characters== Though the programme is mostly composed of one-off sketches, a few characters appear over several episodes. Ben Elton & Hugh Laurie as Mr. Butcher and Mr. Baker Mr. Butcher and Mr. Baker Elton and Laurie appear four times during the first series as two odd gentlemen in a strange cinematic black and white setting. They usually have a dialogue which relies heavily on wordplay, and Laurie does an obvious impression of Peter Cook in E. L. Wisty mode. Alan & Bernard Fry and Laurie appear four times during the first series as two young men discussing topics such as war prevention, a trendy cinema and the SAS. The characters appeared before on There's Nothing to Worry About! and the Cambridge Footlights Revue. Doctor De Quincy Fry appears twice as Doctor De Quincy, a character he also plays in the sitcom Happy Families in 1985, which was also written by Ben Elton. Pretend Pub The cast appear as crew and guests of a pretend pub, which serves as a linking device during the episodes of Series 2: Pretend pub landlord Bobzza (Coltrane), barmaid Shizza (Redmond), Lord Stezza (Fry), Huzza (Laurie), Bezza (Elton) and Ezza (Thompson). == Reception == Mark Duguid, in the British Film Institute's Screenoline resource, described Alfresco as \\"a relatively minor, but not undistinguished, piece of the alternative comedy jigsaw\\". The Guardian wrote: \\"The comedy's more off-the-wall than Elton's later work (some two- handers with Hugh Laurie are almost Boosh-like), and there's a joyful, post- Python 'anything goes' spirit\\". The A.V. Club wrote: \\"Much of the humor in these 16 episodes is more conceptual than funny\\". PopMatters wrote: \\"Not quite an embarrassment to all concerned but rather frayed around the edges and of inconsistent quality, only fans of the individuals concerned or '80s comedy completists need let their curiosity get the better of them.\\" ==Episodes== *Series One: 1 May – 12 June 1983 (Seven episodes) *Series Two: 28 April – 2 June 1984 (Six episodes) ==Home release== DVD box sets containing all thirteen episodes, plus the three episodes of There's Nothing to Worry About as bonus features, have been released by Network in the United Kingdom (Region 2) and Acorn Media in North America (Region 1). ==ReferencesExternal links== *SOTCAA article on Alfresco * * Category:British television sketch shows Category:ITV sketch shows Category:1983 British television series debuts Category:1984 British television series endings Category:1980s British television sketch shows Category:Television series by ITV Studios Category:Television shows produced by Granada Television Category:English- language television shows ","title":"Alfresco (TV series)"},{"id":"5563369","text":"Kole may refer to: *Kole, a superhero from the DC Universe *Kole (name) *Kolë, an Albanian masculine given name *Kole, Democratic Republic of the Congo *Kole District, a district in Northern Uganda *Kole, Uganda, the principal municipality in Kole District *Bakole language of Cameroon *Bakole people of Cameroon *Fr Eugene Kole OFM Conv served as Quincy University's 20th president *KOLE, a radio station *Kole, an early ring name of American professional wrestler Booker Huffman, better known as Booker T ","title":"Kole (disambiguation)"},{"id":"5563376","text":"William Bedford (born December 14, 1963) is an American retired professional basketball player who was selected by the Phoenix Suns in the first round (6th pick overall) of the 1986 NBA draft after playing at Memphis State University (now known as the University of Memphis).

The species is found on the Canary Islands of Tenerife and La Palma. Both the generic name, Gallotia, and the specific name, galloti, are in honor of D. Gallot, an amateur naturalist, who collected the type specimen.Beolens, Bo; Watkins, Michel; Grayson, Michael (2011). The Eponym Dictionary of Reptiles. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press. xiii + 296 pp. . (Gallotia galloti, p. 97). Four subspecies are recognized: *Gallotia galloti eisentrauti - Northern Tenerife lizard (northern Tenerife) *Gallotia galloti galloti - Southern Tenerife lizard (central and southern Tenerife, including Teide) *Gallotia galloti insulanagae - Anaga lizard (Roque de Fuera de Anaga, offshore the Macizo de Anaga mountains, northeastern Tenerife) *Gallotia galloti palmae - La Palma lizard (La Palma) Close-up of Gallotia galloti palmae (male) The large differences in colour pattern in adult males seems to have been the basis for the recognition of the Northern and Southern \\"subspecies\\". The northern form is found at low-mid altitudes on the north- facing slopes, while the southern form is found above the pine forest on the north facing slopes and the southern slopes of Tenerife. A recent genomics study has identified nuclear DNA differences between these regions, although they only seem to be found in small number of loci[1]. Its closest relative is the smaller Boettger's lizard, which occurs on El Hierro and La Gomera (Maca- Meyer et al. 2003). G. galloti is a sizeable lizard, though with strong males reaching up to 15.7 inches (including tail) it still belongs to the smaller Gallotia as the giant species can reach up to double that length. Unlike most larger species of its genus, the Western Canaries lizard as a whole is a common animal. As it likes to eat ripe fruit, it can even become a nuisance in vineyards and orchards and is thus occasionally trapped or poisoned. Local populations thus may decline, but no subspecies currently are endangered. Due to its small area of occurrence, G. g. insulanagae is considered a vulnerable taxon, but it seems safe at present as its habitat is fairly inaccessible and included in the Parque Rural de Anaga (Blanco & González 1992). The striking color of adult males and their curious nature endear them to many tourists. At popular sights, notably Mount Teide, the lizards have become rather tame and an attraction of sorts themselves. It is quite popular to bring some ripe bananas along for the lizards, which are a most favorite food of this species and will provide travellers with good photo opportunities as the animals scurry over the rocks and even onto visitor's hands to catch a bite. ==ReferencesFurther reading== *Brown RP, Paterson S, Risse J (2016). \\"Genomic signatures of historical allopatry and ecological divergence in an island lizard\\".

He was the son of John the Blind, King of Bohemia, and Beatrice of Bourbon. ==Life== Beatrice of Bourbon, gave birth to her only child, Duke Wenceslaus I, on February 25, 1337, in Prague. In 1353 Charles IV King of Bohemia, Count of Luxembourg and elected Holy Roman King, entrusted the county, their father's inheritance, to his half-brother Wenceslaus. In 1352, Wenceslaus married Joanna (1322 - 1406), daughter of John III, Duke of Brabant and Limburg, and Marie d'Évreux. In 1354 Charles raised Luxembourg to the status of a duchy. In 1355, Joanna inherited Brabant and Limburg. In order to guarantee the indivisibility of Brabant, Wenceslaus signed the Joyous Entry, but had to fight against his brother-in-law Louis II of Flanders, who asserted his share of the duchy. He failed to prevent the seizure of Brussels by the Flemings, but a certain Everard 't Serclaes succeeded by an audacious coup in driving them out of the city. Thereafter, Wenceslaus had to face primarily internal disorders. In 1371, he overestimated his military capacities and waged war with William II, Duke of Jülich, resulting in humiliating defeat at the Baesweiler, losing a part of his army, and several noblemen. He was captured and suffered 11 months of captivity. Burial Place in Abbaye d'Orval, Belgium Wenceslaus died in Luxembourg, leaving Joanna as sole ruler of Brabant, and was succeeded by Wenceslaus II (Wenceslaus IV of Bohemia) as duke of Luxembourg. There are speculations that he might have died of leprosy. His last wish was his heart to be displaced from his dead body and sent to his wife (Joanna stayed in Brussels). He is buried in a crypt at the now-ruined Orval Abbey in Belgium. Wenceslaus I of Luxembourg wrote the lyric poetry interpolated in Jean Froissart's Méliador, which was identified as his by Auguste Longnon in the 1890s (Wenceslas was a patron of this chronicler). His lyric output comprises 79 poems (11 ballades, 16 virelais, 52 rondeaux). ==AncestorsReferencesSources== * * ==Further reading== * Category:1337 births Category:1383 deaths Category:Bohemian princes Category:Deaths from leprosy Category:Dukes of Luxembourg Category:House of Luxembourg es:Venceslao I de Luxemburgo#top ","title":"Wenceslaus I, Duke of Luxembourg"},{"id":"5563405","text":"Prelude in C-sharp minor may refer to: * Prelude in C-sharp minor by Sergei Rachmaninoff * Prelude in C-sharp minor, Op. 11, No. 10 by Alexander Scriabin == See also == * Prelude in C (disambiguation) ","title":"Prelude in C-sharp minor"},{"id":"5563409","text":"La Graunde Abridgement was a collection of cases compiled out of the Year Books by Sir Anthony Fitzherbert; this printed edition appeared in 1577.

Substantial numbers of manuscripts circulated during the later medieval period containing reports of pleas heard before the Common Bench. In the sixteenth century versions of this material appeared in print form. These publications constituted the earliest legal precedents of the common law. They are extant in a continuous series from 1268 to 1535, covering the reigns of King Edward I to Henry VIII. The language of the original manuscripts and editions was either Latin or Law French.Black's Law Dictionary, 5th Edition. (West, 1979) Maitland and others have considered that the medieval manuscripts were compiled by law students, rather than being officially sanctioned accounts of court proceedings. The best-known printed version is the so-called \\"Vulgate\\" edition, which appeared in a series of volumes between 1678 and 1680, and which became the standard edition consulted by practising lawyers. More recent editions for the use of lawyers and historians have been made by the Selden Society.Legal History: The Year Books (Boston University School of Law) Traditionally, they have been divided into eleven separate series: # Maynard's Reports, temp.

In 1934, he was appointed as president of football club Bologna. During the first years of his presidency, between 1934 and 1941, the team (led until 1938 by the Hungarian coach Árpád Weisz) won four league titles and the Coupe des Nations in Paris in 1937 (it). In the postwar years, Dall'Ara was unable for many years to repeat the previous successes, until the beginning of the 1960s, when Bologna won the Mitropa Cup in 1961 (it). In the 1963–64 Serie A, Bologna and Inter Milan were about to play the Championship tie-breaker on 7 June 1964; however, four days before the match, on June 3, Dall'Ara died in Milan from a heart attack while he was in the Lega Calcio headquarters for a meeting with Angelo Moratti in preparation for that match.http://badigit.comune.bologna.it/mostre/bologna_fc/6/IMG_5013.jpg Dall'Ara was buried in the Certosa di Bologna along with his wife.

These include both national chart topping bands such as Kaiser Chiefs, but also smaller, more local bands who play small venues around the city and make up the majority of the music scene. ==Electronic music and the clubbing scene== House music had a big impact on Leeds when it arrived in the late 1980s. Early house nights included Downbeat at the Warehouse, Meltdown at the Astoria in Roundhay, and Joy and Kaos at various temporary venues, along with a thriving Shebeen or \\"Blues\\" scene in Chapeltown. Age of Chance formed in Leeds in 1983, their single \\"Don't Get Mad… Get Even\\" reached number 8 on the US Billboard Hot Dance/Club Play chart. Although formed in Harrogate in 1991, Utah Saints were based in Leeds, heavily influenced by the sound of the Prodigy. Throughout the 1990s they had three top ten singles and another five in the top 40 on the UK Singles Chart. International DJs and producers like Paul Woolford, Ralph Lawson and Riley & Durrant have their studios in the city, alongside less well known DJs such as Bragguar and DJ Tango. The earlier underground house scene developed into the Leeds club scene of the 1990s, when for a while Leeds held the title of Britain's clubbing capital. Both Back to Basics and mixed gay night Vague enjoyed the title of best club in Britain at different points in the decade, whilst The Orbit club in Morley was an internationally recognised techno mecca (Orbit closed in 2003 and was replaced by a restaurant). ==Punk rock== Gang of Four performing in 2014 In the late-1970s, Leeds was home to influential punk rock groups such as The Mekons, Gang of Four and Delta 5, who helped to shape the sound of post-punk, and which eventually led to gothic rock thanks to the likes of the Sisters of Mercy and Girls at Our Best!. The members of these bands often frequented the Fenton of Blenheim Terrace. Groups such as the Mekons rejected being labelled as \\"bands\\", instead likening themselves to an art projects espousing Marxism–Leninist politics. These groups also subverted many gender norms within the British punk scene, by attempting to include woman as much as possible. Former Mekons and Delta 5 member Julz Sale said in Music in Leeds vol.2 that no woman \\"ever felt unequal\\" in the scene. During the period, During this period, members of the scene often found themselves in physical altercations against fascists, neo- Nazis and members of the National Front, leading to Leeds playing host to many Rock Against Racism concerts. In the '70s, Leeds also housed the two first openly Nazi punk bands the Dentists and the Ventz. As the aforementioned groups pushed punk rock into more experimental directions, the likes of Abrasive Wheels, The Underdogs, The Expelled and Icon A.D. pursued more aggressive and confrontational punk styles like anarcho punk, street punk and hardcore punk. Chumbawamba, who lived in a squat in Armley, emerged from this scene soon after and transformed it by bringing vegetarianism, animal rights and anti-violence values into the anarchist scene. Along with A State of Mind, Chumbawamba brought about the emergence of the term \\"peace punk\\". In the early–2000s, Leeds punk groups became increasingly interested in the sound of U.S. bands like Fugazi, Hot Water Music and Small Brown Bike, leading to the emergence of a more U.S.–centric sound seen through the likes of And None of Them Knew They were Robots, Fig.4.0, Dugong and Joe Ninety. Send More Paramedics formed in Leeds in 2001 and won Zane Lowe's the 'fresh meat' competition on BBC Radio 1 show, leading to a \\"Guerilla Gig Live\\" performance on BBC Three.\\"B'Hellmouth speaks...to Guerilla Gig live\\", BBC, 2005, retrieved 15 September 2009 In the late–2000s, a scene of hardcore punk bands manifested in the city with groups such as Mob Rules, Rot in Hell and Broken Arm. In an article for The Guardian, Mob Rules drummer Conor Rickford described the scene's nihilistic tendencies as being due to how \\"If you're living in Leeds you're not going to make music that says that the world is a wonderful place and the sun is always shining\\" In the 2010s, Leeds became one of the main locations for the New Wave of British Hardcore, a movement in hardcore punk that merged elements of UK82 and oi! into the sound, through being home to groups such as Violent Reaction, the Flex, Regiment, True Vision and Shrapnel. Around this same time it became home to other hardcore punk bands outside of that sound such as Higher Power and Big Cheese, who showcase a more American- centric take on hardcore. Metal Hammer hailed Higher Power as \\"the band redefining hardcore for a new generation\\", and are the second UK hardcore band to have signed to a major label, in the form of Roadrunner Records. ==Gothic rock== Andrew Eldritch of Leeds gothic rock band the Sisters of Mercy performing in 2019 In the 1980s, many gothic rock acts formed in and around Leeds thanks to venues such as the F Club, Le Phonographique and the Bassment, including The Sisters of Mercy, The March Violets, Southern Death Cult, The Danse Society, Salvation and Skeletal Family. Organiser John Keenan started Futurama Festival in 1979, which quickly became the festival for gothic rock and post-punk acts, featuring acts such as Echo & the Bunnymen, Joy Division, Cabaret Voltaire and Bauhaus. According to Dazed, the use of the word \\"goth\\" to describe the genre was coined by the Yorkshire Evening Post, in a 1983 article describing the fifth Futurama festival.

Their 1990 single Honesty gained significant traction from publications such as NME, however its music video was eventually banned from MTV due to its depiction of the band members committing theft. In the mid–2000s, a scene of pop-centric indie rock groups gained prominence in Leeds through bands such as the Kaiser Chiefs and the Pigeon Detectives. From within this scene, came a sub-sect of more experimental groups like ¡Forward, Russia!, Sky Larkin and This Et Al. The late–2000s saw the emergence of a more aggressive alternative rock scene primarily based in Hyde Park, around venues such as the Brudenell Social Club and the Pack Horse. Two prominent groups in this scene were Dinosaur Pile-Up and Pulled Apart by Horses, who both formed out of the 2007 breakup of Mother Vulpine. Both saw significant commercial success, having performed at the Dr. Martens store in London and at Reading and Leeds Festivals.

He was the first Andrew Mellon Professor of Philosophy at the University of Pittsburgh from 1960 until his death, and also served as Co-Chairman of its Center for Philosophy of Science (from 1978), Research Professor of Psychiatry (from 1979), and Primary Research Professor in the Department of History and Philosophy of Science (from 2006). His works include Philosophical Problems of Space and Time (1963), The Foundations of Psychoanalysis (1984), and Validation in the Clinical Theory of Psychoanalysis (1993). ==Life and career== Adolf Grünbaum's family left Nazi Germany in 1938 and emigrated to the United States. Grünbaum received a B.A. with twofold High Distinction in Philosophy and in Mathematics from Wesleyan University, Middletown, Connecticut in 1943. During the Second World War, Grünbaum was trained at Camp Ritchie, Maryland, and thus was one of the Ritchie Boys. He was stationed in Berlin and interrogated highly-placed Nazis, returning to the United States in 1946. Grünbaum obtained both his M.S. in physics (1948) and his Ph.D in philosophy (1951) from Yale University. He was a chaired professor of Philosophy at Lehigh University, Bethlehem, Pennsylvania (1956–1960), after rising through the ranks there, starting in 1950, becoming a full professor in 1955. In the fall of 1960, Grünbaum left Lehigh University to join the faculty of the University of Pittsburgh, where he became the first Andrew Mellon Professor of Philosophy. In that year, he also became the founding Director of that University's Center for Philosophy of Science, serving as Director until 1978. He and the colleagues he recruited then built world-class Philosophy and History and Philosophy of Science Departments at the university. Several of these colleagues had come from Yale University's Philosophy Department, starting in 1962. During this recruitment period the University of Pittsburgh appointed Nicholas Rescher, Wilfrid Sellars, Richard Gale, Nuel Belnap, Alan Ross Anderson, and Gerald Massey, among others. In 2003, Grünbaum resigned from the Department of Philosophy at the University of Pittsburgh, while retaining his lifetime tenured Mellon Chair and all of his other affiliations at that university. Grünbaum served as President of both the American Philosophical Association (Eastern Division) and the Philosophy of Science Association (two terms). He was the director of the Center for Philosophy of Science from 1960 to 1978.http://www.pitt.edu/~pittcntr/About/past_officers.htm He was the president of the Division of Logic, Methodology and Philosophy of Science of the International Union of History and Philosophy of Science (IUHPS) in 2004–2005 and then automatically became president of the IUHPS from 2006 to 2007. He is also a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. He received the Senior U.S. Scientist Prize from the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation (Germany, 1985), the Fregene Prize for science from the Italian Parliament (1998) and the Wilbur Lucius Cross Medal for outstanding achievement from Yale University (1990). Also, in May 1995, he received an honorary doctorate from the University of Konstanz in Germany and, in 2013, an honorary doctorate of philosophy from the University of Cologne in Germany. In 2013, he received the Großes Bundesverdienstkreuz from the Federal Republic of Germany. Grünbaum was Jewish. He died in November 2018 at the age of 95.University of Pittsburgh: Adolf Grünbaum death notice ==Philosophical work== Grünbaum was the author of nearly 400 articles and book chapters as well as books on space-time and the critique of psychoanalysis. He is often viewed as part of the American brand of logical empiricism, associated especially with Hans Reichenbach.https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/logical- empiricism/ Grünbaum did not embrace the prevailing — especially among physical scientists — Popperian philosophy of science, leading to some notoriety in the 1960s after he was ridiculed in print by the physicist Richard Feynman.James Gleick, Genius: The Life and Science of Richard Feynman (New York: Pantheon Books, 1992, pp. 123-124) A much-quoted exchange followed Grünbaum's neo-Leibnizian suggestion that the flow of time might be an illusion only in conscious entities, in which Feynman asked whether dogs, then cockroaches, were sufficiently conscious entities.Thomas Gold (ed.), The Nature of Time (Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, 1967).

In the era of sail-powered warships with their intrinsic limitations of speed and manoeverability the practice of ramming opponents fell by default into disuse, although the concept remained alive. With the advent of steam-powered vessels, with their enhanced speed and lack of dependence for direction on the wind, the ram as a potent weapon of attack gained credibility in Naval circles and in Ship Constructors' departments. This first became apparent in the American Civil War, when many attempts were made by ships on both sides to ram their opponents, with almost uniform lack of success. (The Confederate Virginia (ex-Merrimack) rammed and sank the Federal Cumberland, but lost her ram and suffered significant structural damage.) The battle which most influenced the exaggerated faith in the ram as a weapon was the battle of Lissa between Austria-Hungary and Italy in 1866. The Austrian Ferdinand Max rammed the (stationary) Italian Re d'Italia, which immediately heeled over and sank. This resulted in all ironclad battleships designed for the next forty years being built to carry a ram; a weapon which, while causing the loss of a number of ships accidentally, never sank another major enemy warship of any nationality. ==Design== Hotspur was designed to work with the Fleet, to bring into action her main weapon, her ram. This projected some ten feet (3 m) ahead of her bow perpendicular, and was reinforced by an extension of the armoured belt. 25-ton muzzle-loading rifle on a broadside mounting aboard Hotspur. The deck beneath the mounting was a turntable which allowed the gun to rotate between several gunports within a fixed circular armored turret. One of the guns shells is hanging in the gunport in front of the gun. 25-ton gun aboard Hotspur. It was assumed that the bearings upon which a usual turret turned would not survive the shock of the impact consequent upon the use of the ram against an enemy ship. Her single gun was therefore positioned in a fixed cupola perforated by four firing-ports through which the gun could be discharged. None of these ports allowed the gun to be fired straight ahead, where a potential ramming target would be situated. It was therefore only possible to engage these targets with the gun if the ramming attack missed. As the maximum speed of Hotspur was less than virtually all of her potential targets, it quickly became apparent that ramming attacks on ships under way were almost guaranteed to miss, and she quickly descended from being a ship held to be of great military value to be the most useless member of the battle-fleet. She was reconstructed by Laird & Sons Co., and was given a revolving turret containing two 12-inch guns, new boilers and additional armour. ==Service history== Hotspur was commissioned at Devonport in 1871, and remained in reserve until 1876. She served with in the Sea of Marmara during the Russo-Turkish war of 1878. She then returned to Devonport, where she remained until her major reconstruction, undertaken by Laird & Sons Co. between 1881 and 1883. Her only active service thereafter was with the Particular Service Squadron of 1885. She was guardship at Holyhead until 1893, was again in reserve until 1897, and was posted thereafter to serve as guardship at Bermuda, where she stayed until sold.

With a length of just , it was one of the smallest known nothosaurs. First discovered at Perledo on the Lake Como in 1830, it was named in 1847 by Curioni, its name meaning \\"Lizard from Larius\\", the ancient name of the lake. This makes it one of the earliest studied reptiles from the Alps. It is known from an almost complete skeleton holotype and several other fairly complete fossils. The nothosaur Eupodosaurus, initially classified as a stegosaurian dinosaur, is now considered synonymous with Lariosaurus. In 1998 Rieppel synonymised Lariosaurus, Silvestrosaurus and Ceresiosaurus, but this is disputed by many authors and they are usually considered close relatives . == Features == Lariosaurus balsami Lariosaurus valceresii For a nothosaur, Lariosaurus was primitive, possessing a short neck and small flippers in comparison to its relatives. This would have made it a relatively poor swimmer, and it is presumed to have spent much time on dry land, or hunting in shallows. It had a large postorbital region of the skull with the temporal fossae noticeably larger than the orbits. The premaxillary and anterior dentary teeth are strongly elongated, like fangs, and could have acted as a 'fish trap'. The parietal and squamosal bones are elongated into a small occipital crest for the attachment of jaw muscles. The vertebrae are pachyostotic and have a low neural spine. Ribs are present from the neck all the way down to the sacrum, which has a cluster of four or five pairs. There are caudal ribs, but they are very small and not present beyond the 15th caudal vertebra. The gastral ribs are made up of multiple elements and form a sturdy kind of armour. The humerus has a weakly developed deltapectoral crest, and increases gradually in width towards the distal end. There is a distinct space between the radius and the more slender ulna.The fingers have more bones than the toes and clearly show how Lariosaurus was unique among nothosaurs because its front legs were adapted into paddles, while the back legs remained five-toed. The femur is more lightly built than the humerus but longer. There is less difference between tibia and fibula than between radius and ulna. Further, based on skeletal findings of immature lariosaurs inside the adults, Lariosaurus is believed by many to be viviparous, or able to bear live young. Another Lariosaurus skeleton was found with two juvenile placodonts of the genus Cyamodus in its stomach, giving an indication of its diet. In 2014 a skull was found in the Winterswijk Muschekalk quarry, of what appeared to be a new species, that was named Lariosaurus vosseveldensis.

Category:Japanese masculine given names ","title":"Hideki"},{"id":"5563611","text":"Peter Willcox is an American sea captain best known for his activism with the environmental organization Greenpeace. He was on board as captain of the Rainbow Warrior when it was bombed and sunk by the DGSE (French intelligence service) in New Zealand in 1985. In 2013, he was aboard the MV Arctic Sunrise when the Russian military boarded it and arrested him and 30 other activists in what became known as the \\"Arctic 30.\\" He was detained for two months before being released. In 2014, he received a Lifetime Achievement Award from The Guardian for his environmental activism. ==Early years== Willcox was born to Eleanor Sharpe of Woodstock, Vermont. Sharp, a member of the U.S Ski team at the time, was unmarried and gave the baby up for adoption at the urging of her family. Willcox was adopted by Roger and Elsie Willcox of South Norwalk, Connecticut. He was raised in Village Creek. Willcox's parents were both politically active. Roger, a community organizer specializing in co-ops, was a sailor. Elsie, who died in 1973, was a middle school science teacher in Norwalk and founded an environmental club in the late 1960s. Both his mother and grandparents, Henry and Anita Willcox, were subpoenaed to testify before the House Un-American Activities Committee, and their careers were ruined as a result. Elise, fearful that a subpoena would endanger her chances of adopting another child, took Peter and his brother Michael underground for three months in 1956. After the adoption papers were finalized, they returned to Norwalk, where she did receive a subpoena to testify. Willcox was taken to many civil rights demonstrations as a child. These culminated in 1965, when Willcox and his father attended the last day of the Selma to Montgomery Civil Rights march. The event crystallized his view that non-violent demonstrations or actions can be useful tools for social change. Willcox attended North Country School, and later The Putney School in Vermont. == Clearwater == During his senior year at The Putney School, Willcox received the number one position in the 1972 draft lottery. He applied for and received conscientious objector status. Thanks to the work of Bill Siebert, the previous first mate, the Hudson River Sloop Clearwater was approved by a Federal Judge to be acceptable work for conscientious objectors. Although President Nixon declared the Vietnam War as over in February 1973, and the draft over, Willcox joined Clearwater. He spent the 1973 season as 2nd and 1st mate, and came back in 1976 as captain. While at Clearwater, Willcox met Pete and Toshi Seeger and saw them as inspirations for activism. == Greenpeace == After spending a year doing humpback whale research on an old square rigger, Willcox saw an ad for mates and engineers on the newly-arrived Greenpeace ship, the Rainbow Warrior. Given a spot as a possible deckhand, he was promoted to First Mate on his first day. Four months later, when the British captain left the ship to return to his family, he became the skipper. On July 10, 1985, as the Rainbow Warrior was at Auckland Harbour preparing to sail in protest French nuclear testing, it was bombed by French intelligence agents and sunk. The incident, which killed freelance photographer Fernando Pereira, caused an international scandal. On September 19, 2013, he was arrested off Russian waters for participating in another Greenpeace campaign. == Notable Greenpeace campaigns == 1981: Offshore Oil drilling on Georges Bank 1982: Stopping National Lead Industries from dumping a million gallons of sulfuric acid off the New Jersey beaches every day. Seal killing in Canada Dolphin killing as part of the tuna industry in the Pacific Whaling campaign in Peru 1983 Seismic surveying off the coast of California.

He and the crew are arrested and held in prison for two months before being granted amnesty. Demonstrations were held all over the world urging Russian President Vladimir Putin to release the Arctic 30. 2016 Peter captains the Rainbow Warrior near Fukushima, Japan to monitor radiation levels being released into the environment by the damaged nuclear reactors. == Family life == Willcox was married in 1991, just in time for the birth of his first daughter, Anita. His second daughter, Natasha, was born in 1995. He was separated in 2002 and moved from Spain where he had been living back to Norwalk, Connecticut. His daughters joined him in 2004. In 2013, he married Maggy Aston, whom he had met on the Clearwater in the late 1970s, on Islesboro island in Maine, where he now lives. He has a step-son named Skylar Purdy. He has nine brothers and sisters, either adopted, biological or step. == Sailing == Willcox grew up sailing. His father Roger was a multiple class national champion, who took his son big boat racing in the early 1960s. Roger continues to be a fair weather frostbite dingy sailor at age 94. Willcox raced for the America's Cup syndicate Freedom – Enterprise in 1979. He has done ten Bermuda Races, did eight S.O.R.C.s (Southern Ocean Racing Circuits) in the 1970s and is still active today. He currently races on a boat called Christopher Dragon out of New York. He estimates he has sailed over 400,000 miles in his professional and recreational career. He retired from Greenpeace in June 2019. He continues to race, ship out, and sail for a better planet. == Writing == Willcox's memoir Greenpeace Captain: My Adventures in Protecting the Future of Our Planet was released on April 18, 2016 in the United States and Canada by St. Martin's Press. In Australia and New Zealand, the book was released by Random House Publishing. ==ReferencesFurther reading== * * * ==External links== * 2013 Audio Interview with Richard Fidler *2015 Audio Interview on Soundcloud #016 Water is Wide *2016 Audio Interview on Soundcloud #139: Adventures in Protecting the Future of our Planet.
