The wilderness is rugged, with elevations ranging from about 2,580 feet along VA 650 in the northwest corner to 4,000 feet on Dickey Ridge. Ridges, capped by lower resistant Cambrian quartzite, have worn away creating large variations in elevation with many high gradient, deeply incised streams. Two long ridges, Dickey Ridge and Bobbys Ridge, run through the area with two peaks on Dickey Ridge, High Point (4,019 feet) and Dicky Knob (3,606 feet)). There is a 300 foot high rock slide area on the eastern boundary, now stabilized with small pines beginning to grow. The wilderness includes the full watershed of Raccoon Branch and Scott Branch, tributaries of Dickey Creek. Other small streams, including Scott Branch, Shanty Branch, Muddy Branch, Slabtree Branch, Mullins Branch, Russell Hollow and Wildcat Branch, all flow from the wilderness in different directions to eventually reach the Holston River. On the boundary of the wilderness is Dickey Creek to the east and southwest, and Comers Creek to the southwest and west.Va wilderness http://www.vawilderness.org/raccoon-branch-wilderness.html ==Management== Designated by Congress in 2009 with a total of 4,225 acres, the wilderness is managed by the United States Forest Service through the Mount Rogers National Recreation Area.

The show is itself based on the characters created by DC Comics set in the Batman mythology. The episode was written by executive producer Danny Cannon and directed by Nathan Hope. It was first broadcast on June 5, 2017. In the episode, Gotham is currently in chaos with most of the citizens getting infected with the Tetch virus. While Gordon struggles to contain the virus inside him, he and Bullock continue looking for an antidote. They plan on having Hugo Strange develop the antidote but they find that he has been taken by Fish Mooney's gang for their own purposes. However, Nygma and Barbara also want the antidote in order to remain their claim over the city but Butch and Tabitha are planning on betraying them. Meanwhile, Bruce finally comes face to face with the man he was looking for: Ra's al Ghul. ==Plot== Gotham City is falling into chaos with nearly all citizens getting infected with the Tetch virus. In the GCPD, Gordon (Ben McKenzie), Bullock (Donal Logue) and Alfred (Sean Pertwee) begin interrogating Bruce (David Mazouz) in an attempt to destroy the Shaman's brainwash. Fox (Chris Chalk) informs them about an antidote that has been designed by Hugo Strange (B. D. Wong). Gordon and Bullock arrive at the train station in order to stop Strange from leaving Gotham but Strange is taken by Fish Mooney (Jada Pinkett Smith). Gordon and Bullock surround Fish and try to get back Strange but Victor Fries (Nathan Darrow) arrives and creates an ice barrier that lets them escape while an infected Gordon slams the barrier. Meanwhile, Nygma (Cory Michael Smith) and Barbara (Erin Richards) set to find Cobblepot (Robin Lord Taylor) to kill him. Alfred tries to save Bruce from the brainwashing but it fails and Bruce even comments that the Court is just paving the way for \\"the one to come\\". During riots in the police department, Bruce manages to escape his cell and sets to find the building the Shaman instructed him to go. Meanwhile, Butch (Drew Powell) and Tabitha (Jessica Lucas) considered to conspire with Fish in order to help her kill Barbara and Nygma. Strange is brought to Dahl Manor where Cobblepot puts the same device that he was put in Arkham Asylum in order to develop the antidote. Cobblepot and Strange meet with Fish, Fries and Bridgit (Camila Perez) in a slaughterhouse in order to get the antidote. Suddenly, members of the League of Shadows arrive and demand the antidote. Fries and Bridgit begin to fend off the assassins when Gordon and Bullock arrive to kill many of them but then, Gordon accidentally kills Fish, causing her to drop the antidotes, shattering them. She dies on Cobblepot's arms. Seeing no choice, Strange then suggests using Tetch's (Benedict Samuel) blood as a way to make a new antidote. However, Barbara, Tabitha and Butch intercept his transfer van and take Tetch. Bruce finally discovers the building and enters a secret passage to a hallway filled with assassins from the League. They guide him to a room that contains a glowing pool and a man (Alexander Siddig) waiting for him. The man replies that the Shaman fulfilled his job and introduces himself as the \\"Demon's Head\\": Ra's al Ghul. Ra's explains that he's been alive for a very long time and that he is looking for a new heir: Bruce. To this end, he brings Alfred into the room and orders Bruce to prove his worth by killing Alfred, giving him a sword to do this with. Despite Alfred's pleas, Bruce impales the sword through his chest. ==Production== Development In May 2017, it was announced that the twenty-first episode of the season will be titled \\"Destiny Calling\\" and was to be written by Danny Cannon and directed by Nathan Hope.

Thought to have been a forest-dwelling browser, Valgipes is a monotypic genus with a complex and long taxonomic history, and is a close relative of Catonyx and Proscelidodon. ==Taxonomy== The taxonomic history of Scelidotheriidae in Brazil is convoluted, and only one species of Valgipes, V. bucklandi, is recognised today, named in honour of William Buckland. Based on the remains of 23 individuals discovered in Lagoa Santa, Minas Gerais, in 1846 Peter Wilhelm Lund described two Brazilian scelidotheriids, Scelidotherium owenii and Scelidotherium bucklandi, while Winge (1915) named them as Scelidotherium magnum and Catonyx giganteus. In 1874, Paul Gervais erected the genus Valgipes for a different species, V. deformis, which he based on a calcaneum bone which he classified as scelidotheriid. Based on comparison of the heel bone with that of Megalonyx, in 1954 Robert Hoffstetter considered that the calcaneum came from an unusual member of the family Megalonychidae, a convention followed by later palaeontologists (although the species was declared incertae sedis in 1979) until the material was studied in further detail, leading to V. deformis and S. bucklandi being combined as Valgipes bucklandi by Cartelle et al. (2009). The only other valid scelidotheriid known from Brazil is Catonyx cuvieri. Valgipes is differentiated from Catonyx based on dentition and postcranial morphology. ==Description== It is similar in size and morphology to Catonyx, with longer and more gracile limb bones, and a wider skull. A number of adult skulls have sagittal crests, while others do not, suggesting possible sexual dimorphism. The claws are narrow and curve gently towards the palm, with the largest claw being on the third digit. Like some other members of the families Mylodontidae and Scelidotheriidae, it had bony osteoderms embedded in its skin. ==Paleoecology== During the Late Pleistocene, the habitat type of the regions inhabited by Valgipes is thought to have been mainly tropical dry forest. Isotopic analysis of a specimen from Rio Grande do Norte indicates it was a browsing animal which lived in relatively closed environments, including the Atlantic Forest, and had a varied diet of leaves, shoots, roots, and fruits. ==Distribution== Fossils of V. bucklandi have been found in: ;Pleistocene *Iraquara; Nova Redenção; and Serra do Ramalho, Bahia, Brazil *Lagoa SantaValgipes at Fossilworks.org and São João das Missões, Minas Gerais, Brazil *Coronel José Dias, Piauí, Brazil *Felipe Guerra, Rio Grande do Norte, Brazil == References == Category:Prehistoric sloths Category:Prehistoric mammal genera Category:Holocene extinctions Category:Pleistocene xenarthrans Category:Pleistocene mammals of South America Category:Lujanian Category:Pleistocene Brazil Category:Fossils of Brazil Category:Fossil taxa described in 1874 ","title":"Valgipes"},{"id":"54108836","text":"Faulkner Brook flows into the West Branch Delaware River by Balls Eddy, Pennsylvania. ==References== Category:Rivers of Pennsylvania Category:Rivers of Wayne County, Pennsylvania Category:Tributaries of the Delaware River ","title":"Faulkner Brook"},{"id":"54108837","text":"==Events== * January 11 – It is announced that Lan Shui will stand down as music director of the Singapore Symphony Orchestra in January 2019. * January 22 - The Shanghai Symphony Orchestra, the Guangzhou Symphony Orchestra, and the China Philharmonic Orchestra all announce the cancellation of scheduled concert appearances with Korean soprano Sumi Jo, without formal explanation.

It features eleven teams of two in a race around the world for a US$1 million grand prize. The season premiered on January 3, 2018, airing in CBS's Wednesday 8:00 pm EST time slot for a month before moving to the 9:00 pm slot from February 7 due to the premiere of Celebrity Big Brother. The 2-hour season finale aired on February 21, 2018. Dating reality stars Cody Nickson and Jessica Graf were the winners of this season of the Race, making them the first team previously cast on Big Brother to win The Amazing Race. ==Production and filming== Development The 30th season of The Amazing Race started filming on October 1, 2017, at Washington Square Park in New York City. As seen before in the twenty-fifth and twenty- seventh seasons, the show's website announced they would begin filming on October 1, 2017, at Washington Square Park in New York City, and invited fans to join them as they saw the new teams off. This season introduced \\"Head-to- Head\\" competitions, pitting two teams directly against one another. Such competitions already appeared in several international versions of the show (Latin American, Israeli, Norwegian, Philippine, Chinese, and Canadian). Additionally for the first time, teams swapped partners with another team and ran most of a leg with them instead. This season has the fewest episodes than any other American series at eight. For four weeks during the season's eight- week run, two legs each aired on one, 2-hour episode. Normally a 12-leg season has either 12 episodes for each leg, or 11 episodes with only one 2-hour special episode (usually the first or the final episode). Miss Iceland Ólafía Ósk Finnsdóttir appeared as the Pit Stop greeter during Leg 1. This season was the first time The Amazing Race visited Bahrain. The Express Pass, which has been a feature of every season since its inception in The Amazing Race 17, did not appear in this season. Casting While the team of Big Brother houseguests Jessica Graf and Cody Nickson from the recently concluded Season 19 was announced earlier, the full cast of 11 teams of two was revealed on December 7, 2017. Among these include former NBA players Cedric Ceballos and Shawn Marion, IndyCar racers Conor Daly and Alexander Rossi, freestyle skiers Kristi Leskinen and Jen Hudak, Well-Strung members Trevor Wadleigh and Chris Marchant, and competitive eaters Joey Chestnut and Tim Janus. April Gould from Team Goat Yoga previously competed on Season 7 and Season 9 of American Ninja Warrior but failed to make it past the qualifier for both seasons. At the Pit Stop of Leg 5, Lucas Bocanegra proposed to Brittany Austin, who accepted, becoming the fourth team to do so after Hayden & Aaron from The Amazing Race 6, Chad & Stephanie from The Amazing Race 17, and Matt & Ashley from The Amazing Race 26. Future appearances Cody & Jessica appeared on the premiere of Celebrity Big Brother 1 and on the seventh episode of Big Brother 20, during the latter of which they hosted a Power of Veto competition and announced their engagement. ==Results== As announced by CBS, the following teams participated in the Race.

Because Dessie was the last person to physically step on the mat, Dessie & Kayla were eliminated. # At the Leg 5 Pit Stop, after coming in first, Lucas proposed to Brittany, who accepted, changing their relationship from dating to engaged. # Teams had to swap partners for a duration of the leg. Cody paired with Jen, Jessica paired with Kristi, Lucas paired with Conor, Brittany paired with Alex, Henry paired with Eric, and Evan paired with Daniel. Because of this, in order to check in at the Pit Stop, team members had to reunite with their original partner. Cody & Jen arrived 1st, Brittany & Alex arrived 2nd, Lucas & Conor arrived 3rd, Daniel & Evan arrived 4th, Eric & Henry arrived 5th, and Jessica & Kristi arrived last. Teams swapped back to their original partners once both partners checked in. # Lucas realized that he lost his passport while on a connecting flight from Zimbabwe to Bahrain. As a result, Lucas & Brittany did not arrive in Bahrain until many hours after all the other teams had already checked in at the Pit Stop.

Together with his wife Huang Liqun, Tsang founded his manufacturing company which later became Goldlion Group Co. Ltd. when he cleared half of his house for a workplace. He produced ties by his own by copying from some internationally famous brands and mixing in his own designs. He also imported some expensive materials from France and refined his techniques, which later turned into the success of his company. In the 1980s, Tsang became involved in philanthropic activities. In 1992, he established the Tsang Hin Chi Education Fund for poor students. He later served as chairman and later honorary president of Jinan University. He was also a core member of the pro-Beijing Chinese General Chamber of Commerce in which he became the life honorary chairman. He also became member of the executive committee of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce in 1993 and vice-chairman of the Guangdong and National Federations of Industry and Commerce. In 1985, he was appointed member of the Hong Kong Basic Law Consultative Committee for drafting the Basic Law of Hong Kong. In 1992, he was invited to become 1st Group of Hong Kong Affairs Advisors of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council of the People's Republic of China. In 1993, he became member of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPCSC), where he served two terms from 1993 to 2003. He was also appointed to the HKSAR Preparatory Committee on the eve of the handover of Hong Kong. He was a member of the Selection Committee, which was responsible for electing the first Chief Executive and Provisional Legislative Council He was a vocal supporter of the Beijing government and strong critic of the pro-democracy camp. In 2004, he accused Martin Lee, Szeto Wah and Cheung Man-kwong are \\"definitely unpatriotic\\" for their bag of sins (being key members of the Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements in China formed during the Tiananmen protests of 1989), including objecting to the Hong Kong Basic Law Article 23 national security legislation and organising the 1 July 2003 rally. According to Radio Free Asia, Tsang Hin-chi received a kidney transplant operation in the No. 1 Affiliated Hospital to Guangzhou Zhongshan University in 2000. The kidney he received was allegedly extracted from an executed prisoner but was not reported due to political sensitivity. Tsang died in Meizhou on 20 September 2019, aged 85. ==Honours== In 1993, an asteroid numbered 3388, which was discovered by the Purple Mountain Observatory of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, was named after him. He was also among the first recipients of the Grand Bauhinia Medal in 1997, the highest honor of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. Tsang was named an honorary citizen by several major Chinese cities, including Beijing, Harbin, Shenyang, Dalian, and Guangzhou. He also held an honorary doctorate from Zhongshan University and Hong Kong Polytechnic University. The Meixian Tsang Hin-chi Stadium in Meixian District was named after Tsang Hin-chi, who donated ¥15 million for construction of the stadium.曾宪梓捐1500万助建 广东梅县曾宪梓体育场启用 ==References== Category:1934 births Category:2019 deaths Category:Sun Yat-sen University alumni Category:Hong Kong businesspeople Category:Hong Kong philanthropists Category:Hong Kong people of Hakka descent Category:People from Meixian District Category:Recipients of the Grand Bauhinia Medal Category:Members of the Selection Committee of Hong Kong Category:Members of the Standing Committee of the 8th National People's Congress Category:Members of the Standing Committee of the 9th National People's Congress Category:Delegates to the 8th National People's Congress from Hong Kong Category:Delegates to the 9th National People's Congress from Hong Kong Category:Hong Kong Basic Law Consultative Committee members Category:Hong Kong Affairs Advisors Category:Members of the Preparatory Committee for the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Category:Businesspeople from Meizhou ","title":"Tsang Hin-chi"},{"id":"54108917","text":"Sands Creek is a river in Delaware County, New York.

He has published several books of photography. He is known for his portraits and short films. == Life and career== Harvey Wang was born in Queens, New York, in 1956. He received a Bachelor of Arts degree in Anthropology from Purchase College, State University of New York in 1977. He visited Madison County, North Carolina to conduct research and take photographs for his honors thesis \\"At the Crossroads,\\" which explored the impact of popular culture on the folk culture of the area. His photographs were subsequently shown in the exhibition At the Crossroads: Music and Photographs from Madison County, North Carolina at the Neuberger Museum at Purchase College in 1977. After graduation, he worked as a photographer for the Village Voice under picture editor Fred W. McDarrah. In the early 1980s, Wang frequented and photographed Club 57, a nightclub on St. Mark’s Place in the East Village, New York City that served as a mecca for filmmakers, artists, and musicians. His photographs of Club 57 regulars included Anne Magnuson, John \\"Lypsinka\\" Epperson, Kai Eric, Tseng Kwong Chi, Dany Johnson, Charlotte Slivka, Tom Scully, Klaus Nomi, Wendy Wild, John Sex, Deb O'Nair, Keith Haring, James Chance, Pat Place, Anya Phillips, and others. These photographs were included in the exhibition \\"Club 57: Film, Performance, and Art in the East Village, 1978-1983\\" at the Museum of Modern Art, New York in 2017. He photographed the Lower East Side, Chinatown, and the East Village in New York City extensively in the 1970s and 1980s. A selection of his photographs were exhibited at P.S. 1 in the New York/New Wave exhibition in New York City in 1981. In 1983 he worked with author Edward Kiersh on Where Have You Gone, Vince DiMaggio?, a book about retired Major League baseball players. Subjects included Vince DiMaggio, Ernie Banks, Roger Maris, Harmon Killebrew, Gene Woodling, Harvey Haddix, Willie McCovey, Pumpsie Green, and Dusty Rhodes. Wang's photographs of these players appeared in a solo exhibition at the New York Public Library (New York City) in 1983. In 1986, Wang photographed the subjects of Victoria Balfour's book Rock Wives, a collection of interviews with eighteen people who have lived with and around stars of rock and roll. Subjects included Susan Rotolo, Claudette Robinson, Angie Bowie, Ingrid Croce, Bebe Buell, and Carlene Carter. His portraits of older New Yorkers whose occupations and ways of life were being threatened by change were published in Harvey Wang’s New York in 1990, and exhibited in a solo exhibition at the Museum of the City of New York in 1992. Subjects included Ella Baker, a civil rights activist; Eddie Day, the Cyclone rollercoaster brakeman at Coney Island, Brooklyn; Joey Faye, a burlesque comedian; Tom Rella, a gravedigger at the Bayside Cemetery in Queens; Aston Robinson, a waiter at Gage and Tollner in Brooklyn; Helen Giamanco, the longest-working employee at Horn & Hardart in New York City; Edward Robb Ellis, the writer of one of the longest diaries in the world; Editta Sherman, the “Duchess of Carnegie Hall” and portrait photographer; and Benesh Horowitz, a typesetter at The Forward. In the early 1990s, Wang teamed up with radio producer David Isay. Over a period of several years, they traveled across the country together to interview and photograph interesting Americans. The interview excerpts and portraits were published in 1995 in Holding On: Dreamers, Visionaries, Eccentrics and Other American Heroes. Photographs drawn from Harvey Wang’s New York and Holding On were the basis for the solo exhibition Going Strong: Older Americans on the Job at the National Museum of American History at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, DC in 1995. These portraits showed older Americans still working proudly at their lifelong professions. The show subsequently traveled as part of the Smithsonian Institution Traveling Exhibition Service (SITES) program. In 2000, Wang photographed the residents of the last remaining flophouses on New York City’s Bowery for the book Flophouse: Life on the Bowery, a collaboration with radio producers David Isay and Stacy Abramson. The project culminated in an exhibition at the New-York Historical Society in 2001. In the early 2000s, Wang began to explore the craft of photography and the careers of other photographers. His short film about Milton Rogovin, Milton Rogovin: The Forgotten Ones, won the prize for Best Documentary Short at the Tribeca Film Festival in 2003. In the film, Wang accompanies Milton and Anne Rogovin as they shoot the final portraits in their “Quartets” series on Buffalo, New York’s Lower West Side. Wang also wrote an afterword for the book Milton Rogovin: The Forgotten Ones. Starting in 2008, Wang began to explore how photographers were affected by the momentous change in photography in the wake of the transition from film to digital methods. The book of interviews and portraits, titled From Darkroom to Daylight, was published in 2015. A documentary film of the same name screened at photography festivals, museums, colleges, and other public venues. Subjects included Jerome Liebling, George Tice, Elliott Erwitt, David Goldblatt, Sally Mann, Gregory Crewdson, Susan Meiselas, Eugene Richards, Steven Sasson, who built the first digital camera at Kodak, and Thomas Knoll, who alongside his brother created Photoshop. Wang directed a feature film in 2007, The Last New Yorker, featuring Dominic Chianese, Dick Latessa, and Kathleen Chalfant. == Selected publications == *From Darkroom to Daylight.

He is mostly known as Gianni Fava. ==Biography== Giovanni Fava was born on 8 May 1968 in Viadana, but he lives with his family in Pomponesco. He is also a businessman. Career as politician Elected as a member of Montecitorio (the Italian Chamber of Deputies) in the 2006 general election who took place on 9–10 April 2006, Giovanni Fava was proclaimed MP on 28 April 2006 (this term officially ended on 28 April 2008). Re-elected in the 2008 general election who took part on 13–14 April 2008, Fava was proclaimed MP on 29 April 2008 (this term officially ended on 14 March 2013). Re-elected also in the 2013 general election who took place on 24–25 February 2013, Fava was proclaimed MP on 5 March 2013 and officially started the new legislature on 15 March, but on 19 March Fava was nominated by Roberto Maroni (elected President of Lombardy in the 2013 Regional election who took place on 24–25 February 2013, Maroni sworn in office on 18 march) as new Regional (Lombardy) minister of Agriculture: according to the Italian electoral law, within 3 months since the proclamation a politician must choose between the Regional politics (as Regional Councilor or as Regional Minister) and the National politics (as MP). Consequently, on 4 June 2013 (one day before the quarterly expiry date) Fava resigned from Montecitorio because he preferred the Regional politics and Fava's seat in Montecitorio passed to the former MP Andrea Angelo Gibelli (that resigned on 5 June 2013 because he preferred the Regional politics and that seat in Montecitorio immediately passed to the Comunal Councilor of San Rocco al Porto Guido Guidesi, for the first time elected MP. Guidesi was officially proclaimed MP on 5 June 2013). Fava in 1993–2001Between 1993 and 2001 every Mayor in Italy was elected every 4 years with a direct popular election. Since 2001 every Mayor in Italy is elected every 5 years with a direct popular election. Fava was elected for his first term on 22 November 1993 and he won his second term on 17 November 1997 (sources: Gazzetta di Mantova). Fava left office at the end of his second term on 13 May 2001. was the Mayor of Pomponesco. With the end of Maroni's Presidency, Fava in March 2018 left his office as Regional (Lombardy) minister of Agriculture. Candidate as Federal Secretary of Lega Nord (2017) Fava obtained national notoriety in Italy because he participated at the 2017 primary election of Lega Nord against Matteo Salvini, the incumbent Federal Secretary of Lega Nord: in the run-up of the 2017 leadership election Salvini was focused on becoming the Leader of the centre-right and, possibly, changing the LN's name by ditching \\"North\\". Whil Paolo Grimoldi (the regional secretary of Lega Nord for Lombardy) chose not to run and Roberto Maroni (the President of Lombardy Region) maintained his neutrality), Fava (Lombard minister of Agriculture in the old social- democratic tradition) announced his bid aiming at representing the federalist/autonomist/separatist wings of the party. Gianluca Pini, President of Lega Nord Romagna, supported Fava: note that Fava's best results in this LN primary (over 40% but under 45%) are only in Romagna. Fava, who is anti- prohibition of drugs, pro-civil unions for same-sex couples, pro-United States, pro-NATO, and anti-National Front (\\"[it] is one of the most centralist and conservative blocs in Europe, what has it to do with us?\\"), recalled an old LN activist saying \\"let's hurry up in making Padania, that I want to return voting the left\\" and added \\"this was the League and it has to be like this anew\\". Salvini accused Fava to be \\"too friend of Berlusconi\\" and specially of \\"wanting to submit the LN to Forza Italia\\". This is a closed primary where all ordinary and militant members with at least 12 months of membership are reserved for 31 December 2016 and they also have the right to sign in support of \\"secretarial nominations\\", which they need a minimum of 1000 signatures to be able to apply. Each candidate must be registered for at least 10 years as ordinary and militant members of LN: the only candidates for the post of Federal Secretary are those of Matteo Salvini and Giovanni Fava, both of which exceed the minimum of 1000 signatures (precisely 6925 for Salvini and 1025 for Fava). Umberto Bossi, the founder of LN, support Giovanni Fava and his plan of approach to Forza Italia and Silvio Berlusconi from which the Lega Nord has gradually gone away (in favor of Giorgia Meloni's Brothers of Italy) during Salvini's leadership since the previous primary election of December 2013. Salvini was re-elected Federal Secretary by a landslide (82.7%) on 14 May. His re-election was ratified by the party's federal congress on 21 May in Parma. ==ReferencesExternal links== * Official Website Category:1968 births Category:Living people Category:People from the Province of Mantua Category:Italian Roman Catholics Category:Lega Nord politicians Category:Deputies of Legislature XV of Italy Category:Deputies of Legislature XVI of Italy Category:Deputies of Legislature XVII of Italy Category:Mayors of places in Lombardy Category:Politicians of Lombardy ","title":"Gianni Fava"},{"id":"54108965","text":"Dr. Aubre de Lambert Maynard (1901-1999) was an American physician.

Allard became Chair of the Genetics Department at University of California, Davis in 1967; he was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 1973, and was awarded the DeKalb-Pfizer Distinguished Career Award and the Crop Science Science of America Award. He was honored as the Nilsson-Ehle Lecturer of the Mendelian Society of Sweden and as the Wilhelmine Key lecturer of the American Genetic Association. He also served as president of the Genetics Society of America, the American Genetic Association and the American Society of Naturalists. As Chair of the Department of Genetics at U.C. Davis he played a major role in bringing Theodosius Dobzhansky and Francisco J. Ayala to the Genetics Department in the early 1970s. With G. Ledyard Stebbins there as well, the department became preeminent in both plant and animal evolution. He trained 56 doctorate students and more than 100 masters students over his career. ==Education== Allard Staff U.C. Davis Staff Editor 1939 Allard entered U.C. Davis as an undergraduate in 1937, and attended the University of Wisconsin–Madison for graduate training. His PhD work was interrupted by World War II, where he engaged in biowarfare research. After the War he returned to U.W. Madison to defend his Ph.D. thesis on wheat cytogenetics. R.W. Allard as U.S. Navy Ensign, 1944 ==Early career and research== He joined the faculty at U.C. Davis in 1946, where he was hired as a plant breeder in the Agronomy Department. He worked on developing varieties of lima beans, in addition to studying the inheritance of its seed coat polymorphisms as well as this plant's basic genetics. He also worked on wheat diseases. In the 1950s he also started doing research in the area of quantitative genetics, and by the 1960s he had broadened his use of experimental plants to include barley. Additionally at this time he published perhaps his most important publication, the 1960 book \\"Principles of Plant Breeding\\", which was translated into 17 languages, and was the principal plant breeding book for at least a generation. A second edition was published in 1999. His ever-expanding interests led him into plant population genetics, a field that he essentially founded. His particular interest was in the population genetics of Inbreeding species, and included wild plants such as Collinsia, Avena barbata and Avena fatua. His interest in inbreeding species probably stemmed from his interactions with Ledyard Stebbins, who was also at U.C. Davis, and had predicted that wild inbreeding plant populations should be devoid of genetic variation. As a plant breeder who had done selection on inbreeding species in cultivated plants, Allard knew that there was ample genetic variation within \\"pure lines.\\" It is easy to see how he would have become intrigued with inbreeding wild species. And indeed starting in the early 1960s he worked with experimental populations of wheat, barley, and lima beans as well as the wild plants Collinsia, Avena barbata, and Avena fatua investigating a wide variety of issues important to the population genetics of inbreeding species. He published numerous foundational papers on the effects of mating systems, selection, gene-environment interactions, linkage disequilibrium, and genetic drift on the genetic variation of inbreeding plant populations. Starting at the latter part of the 1960s and to the end of his career, Allard and co- workers focused primarily in a new area for his lab, that of ecological genetics, particularly in the plant Avena barbata. This work was greatly assisted at the end of the 1960s and throughout the 1970s and 1980s by the use of molecular markers known as isozymes combined with traditional quantitative genetics and morphological single-marker traits as well as more advanced molecular techniques as these became available in the 1980s and 1990s and were applied to Avena barbata and other species such as wild and cultivated barley and pines. An over-riding theme of Allard's lifetime work was the demonstration of \\"favorable epistatic combinations of alleles of different loci\\", or multilocus gene complexes in wild and cultivated plants that were assembled in and adapted to specific habitats. To illustrate this theme his last two papers focused on two in-breeding species (the slender wild oat Avena barbata and barley Hordeum vulgare) and one outcrossing species, corn (Zea maize). ==ReferencesExternal links== * Category:1919 births Category:2003 deaths Category:People from the San Fernando Valley Category:University of Wisconsin-Madison alumni Category:Evolutionary biologists Category:Scientists from California Category:University of California, Davis faculty Category:Population geneticists Category:American geneticists Category:Members of the United States National Academy of Sciences Category:Fellows of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences ","title":"Robert W.

It is derived from the ancient Chinese suanpan, imported to Japan in the 14th century. Astronomy Edo- and Meiji-era Japan saw intense engagement with European astronomy that fed into its present-day strength in rocket science. European texts on astronomy were among the first to be allowed in Japan; because all references to Christianity were expunged, the Japanese editions of these works were among the first to apply methodological Naturalism. The Japanese were impressed by the accuracy of Western astronomical models; this led further books to be imported beginning in 1720 under Shōgun Tokugawa Yoshimune. Among the first changes to Japanese culture in the Edo period due to the introduction of Western astronomy was the adoption of a variation of the Gregorian calendar, due to its superiority at predicting eclipses. Later, Western astronomical observations and methods were integrated with philology and political science to synthesize a conception of Shinto as astronomical science in the Kokugaku movement, which played a major role in the Meiji state. The Meiji government educationally promoted up-to-date astronomy through textbooks and cultural campaigns. Through these endeavors, astronomy emerged as a topic of study in Japanese universities that persists to this day. Automata Karakuri puppets are traditional Japanese mechanized puppets or automata, originally made from the 17th century to the 19th century.

The Japanese craftsman Hisashige Tanaka, known as \\"Japan's Edison\\", created an array of extremely complex mechanical toys, some of which were capable of serving tea, firing arrows drawn from a quiver, or even painting a Japanese kanji character. The landmark text Karakuri Zui (Illustrated Machinery) was published in 1796. Clocks The Myriad year clock was a universal clock designed by the Japanese inventor Hisashige Tanaka in 1851.

The Japanese tale of Urashima Tarō involves time travel to a distant future, and was first described in the Nihongi (720). It has been identified as one of the first examples of a story involving time travel. The 10th-century Japanese narrative, The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter, is also considered proto-science fiction. A manuscript illustration, for example, depicts a round flying machine similar to a flying saucer. (cf. ) The Tale of Genji, written by Lady Murasaki Shikibu in 11th-century Japan, has often been considered the first psychological novel.Jorge Luis Borges, The Total Library: \\"[The Tale of Genji, as translated by Arthur Waley,] is written with an almost miraculous naturalness, and what interests us is not the exoticism – the horrible word – but rather the human passions of the novel. Such interest is just: Murasaki's work is what one would quite precisely call a psychological novel. ... I dare to recommend this book to those who read me. The English translation that has inspired this brief insufficient note is called The Tale of Genji.\\" Mathematics In 1683 (Kai-Fukudai-no-Hō), Seki Kōwa came up with elimination theory, based on resultant. To express resultant, he developed the notion of determinant.Howard Eves: \\"An Introduction to the History of Mathematics\\", page 405, Saunders College Publishing, 1990. () Determinants were introduced to study elimination of variables in systems of higher-order algebraic equations. They were used to give shorthand representation for the resultant. The determinant as an independent function was first studied by Seki Kōwa in 1683. Bernoulli numbers were studied by Seki Kōwa and published after his death, in 1712. Jacob Bernoulli independently developed the concept in the same period, but his work was published a year later, in 1713.Selin, Helaine. (1997), An Introduction to the History of Mathematics.

The term \\"Jōmon\\" (縄文) means \\"rope-patterned\\" in Japanese, describing the patterns that are pressed into the clay. The pottery vessels crafted in Ancient Japan during the Jōmon period are generally accepted to be the oldest pottery in Japan. Bits of pottery discovered in a cave in the northwest coast of modern- day Kyushu date back to as far as 12,700 BC in radiometric dating tests.Rice, Prudence M. \\"On the Origins of Pottery.\\" Journal of Archaeological Method and Theory 6, no. 1 (1999): 1–54. Database on-line. Springerlink; accessed 3 October 2007. It is believed by many that Jōmon pottery was probably made even earlier than this date. However, due to ambiguity and multiple sources claiming different dates based on different dating techniques, it is difficult to say for sure how far back Jōmon Pottery was made. Some sources claim archaeological discoveries as far back as the 14th millennium BCE.Kuzmin, Yaroslav V. \\"Chronology of the earliest pottery in East Asia: progress and pitfalls.” Antiquity 80, (2006): 362–371.

It was widely exported from the port of Imari, Saga, to Europe during the 17th and 18th centuries.Oliver Impey, \\"Japanese export art of the Edo Period and its influence on European art\\", Modern Asian Studies 18.4, Special Issue: Edo Culture and Its Modern Legacy (1984, pp. 685–697) p. 695. \\"On the one hand a gaudy, brash brightly coloured and highly decorated style, the Imari style.\\" ==Modern science== In the natural sciences, the number of Japanese winners of the Nobel Prize has been second only to the United States in the 21st century, for contributions made in the 20th century. On the list of countries by research and development spending, Japan is third on the list, behind the United States and China. Chemistry ;Frontier Molecular Orbital Theory In 1952, Kenichi Fukui published a paper in the Journal of Chemical Physics titled \\"A molecular theory of reactivity in aromatic hydrocarbons.\\" He later received the 1981 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his investigations into the mechanisms of chemical reactions, with his prize-winning work focused on the role of frontier orbitals in chemical reactions, specifically that molecules share loosely bonded electrons which occupy the frontier orbitals, that is the Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital (HOMO) and the Lowest Unoccupied Molecular Orbital (LUMO).Bell J, Johnstone B, Nakaki S: The new face of Japanese science.

He was awarded the 2008 Nobel Prize in Chemistry \\"for the discovery and development of the green fluorescent protein, GFP\\". Koichi Tanaka was awarded the 2003 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for the development of soft laser desorption, \\"methods for identification and structure analyses of biological macromolecules\\" and for \\"soft desorption ionisation methods for mass spectrometric analyses of biological macromolecules\\". In 1987, he demonstrated that laser pulses could blast apart large protein molecules so that ions in gaseous form are produced. ;Conductive polymers Hideki Shirakawa was awarded the 2000 Nobel Prize in Chemistry \\"for the discovery and development of conductive polymers\\". Mathematics In the 1930s, while studying switching circuits, NEC engineer Akira Nakashima independently discovered Boolean algebra, which he was unaware of until 1938. In a series of papers published from 1934 to 1936, he formulated a two-valued Boolean algebra as a way to analyze and design circuits by algebraic means in terms of logic gates. Medicine In a landmark series of experiments beginning in 1976, Susumu Tonegawa showed that genetic material can rearrange itself to form the vast array of available antibodies. He later received the 1987 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine \\"for his discovery of the genetic principle for generation of antibody diversity.\\" Physics ;Particle physics Hideki Yukawa predicted the existence of mesons in 1934, for which he later received the 1949 Nobel Prize in Physics.The Noble Foundation (1949) Nobel Prize in Physics 1949 – Presentation Speech Yoichiro Nambu was awarded the 2008 Nobel Prize in Physics for his 1960 discovery of the mechanism of spontaneous broken symmetry in subatomic physics, related at first to the strong interaction's chiral symmetry (chiral symmetry breaking) and later to the electroweak interaction and Higgs mechanism. The bottom quark is a product in almost all top quark decays, and is a frequent decay product for the Higgs boson. The bottom quark was theorized in 1973 by physicists Makoto Kobayashi and Toshihide Maskawa to explain CP violation. Toshihide Maskawa and Makoto Kobayashi's 1973 article, \\"CP Violation in the Renormalizable Theory of Weak Interaction\\", is the fourth most cited high energy physics paper of all time as of 2010. They discovered the origin of the explicit breaking of CP symmetry in the weak interactions. The Cabibbo–Kobayashi–Maskawa matrix, which defines the mixing parameters between quarks, was the result of this work.

He conducted pioneering work on solar neutrino detection, and Koshiba's work also resulted in the first real-time observation of neutrinos from the SN 1987A supernova. These efforts marked the beginning of neutrino astronomy. Psychology The Rashomon effect is where the same event is given contradictory interpretations by different individuals involved. The concept originates from Akira Kurosawa's 1950 film Rashomon, in which a murder is described in four mutually contradictory ways by its four witnesses. ==Modern technology== In terms of the number of patents filed annually, Japan is second only to the United States.Ranking of the 10 countries who filed the most international patent applications in 2016, Statista In terms of patents published per capita, Japan has the highest in the world, ahead of South Korea and the United States.Patent applications > Residents > Per capita, NationMaster Since the 20th century, Japan has played an important role in the Digital Revolution and the Information Age. Audio ;Digital audio Commercial digital recording was pioneered by NHK and Nippon Columbia, also known as Denon, in the 1960s. The first commercial digital recordings were released in 1971. In 1967, the first PCM (pulse-code modulation) recorder was developed by NHK's research facilities in Japan. In 1969, NHK expanded PCM's capabilities to 2-channel stereo and 32 kHz 13-bit resolution. In January 1971, using NHK'S PCM recording system, engineers at Denon recorded the first commercial digital recordings, including Uzu: The World Of Stomu Yamash'ta 2 by Stomu Yamashta. Compact Disc Digital Audio (CD- DA), also called Red Book, was an audio format developed by Sony and Philips in 1980, and commercially introduced with their compact disc (CD) format in 1982. ;Speech synthesis In 1968, the first text-to-speech synthesis system was developed by Noriko Umeda's team at Japan's Electrotechnical Laboratory. ;Direct-drive turntables The direct-drive turntable was invented by Shuichi Obata, an engineer at Matsushita (now Panasonic),Billboard, 21 May 1977, page 140 based in Osaka, Japan.Brian Coleman, The Technics 1200 — Hammer Of The Gods, Medium It eliminated the belts of older belt-drive turntables, and instead employed a motor to directly drive a platter on which a vinyl record rests.Trevor Pinch, Karin Bijsterveld, The Oxford Handbook of Sound Studies, page 515, Oxford University Press In 1969, Matsushita released it as the SP-10, the first direct-drive turntable on the market, and the first in their Technics series of turntables. This gave rise to turntablism, with the most influential turntable being the Technics SL-1200, released in 1972 and remaining the most widely used turntable in DJ culture for the next several decades.Six Machines That Changed The Music World, Wired, May 2002 DJ turntablism has origins in the invention of direct-drive turntables. Early belt-drive turntables were unsuitable for turntablism, since they had a slow start-up time, and they were prone to wear-and-tear and breakage, as the belt would break from backspinning or scratching.The World of DJs and the Turntable Culture, page 43, Hal Leonard Corporation, 2003 In 1972, Technics started making their SL-1200 turntable, which became the most popular turntable for DJs due to its high torque direct-drive design. Hip hop DJs began using the Technics SL-1200s as musical instruments to manipulate records with turntablism techniques such as scratching and beat juggling rather than merely mixing records. In 1975, hip-hop DJ Grand Wizard Theodore invented the scratching technique by accident. He developed the technique while experimenting with a Technics SL-1200 turntable, finding that its direct-drive motor would continue to spin at the correct RPM even if the DJ wiggled the record back and forth on the platter. Although Technics stopped producing the SL-1200 in 2010, they remain the most popular DJ turntable due to their high build quality and durability. The SL-1200 evolved into the SL-1200 MK2 in 1979—which, as of the early-2010s, remains an industry standard for DJing. ;Walkman The Walkman prototype was built in 1978 by audio-division engineer Nobutoshi Kihara for Sony co-founder Masaru Ibuka. Ibuka wanted to be able to listen to operas during his frequent trans-Pacific plane trips, and presented the idea to Kihara. The Walkman was commercially released in 1979. Automobiles Kei cars are a category of small automobiles invented in Japan, including passenger cars, vans, and pickup trucks. They are designed to exploit local tax and insurance relaxations, and in more rural areas are exempted from the requirement to certify that adequate parking is available for the vehicle.\\"Minicars: Cheap and Cheerful\\", Peter Nunn, JAMA, January–February 2005\\"Owning a Car in Japan\\" , ALTs in Sendai Calculators ;Electric calculators The world's first all-electric compact calculator was the Casio Computer Company's Model 14-A, released in 1957.Chronology of Main Products, CasioHistory of Casio, Casio, 2014 The first electronic desktop calculator with on-board memory was the Casio 001, released in 1965. In 1967, Casio released the AL-1000, the world's first programmable desktop calculator. ;Large-scale integration (LSI) The Sharp QT-8D, a desktop calculator released in 1969, was the first calculator to have its logic circuitry entirely implemented with LSI (large-scale integration) integrated circuits (ICs) based on MOS (metal-oxide-semiconductor) technology. Upon its introduction, it was one of the smallest electronic calculators ever produced commercially. ;Portable calculators The first portable calculators appeared in Japan in 1970, and were soon marketed around the world. These included the Sanyo ICC-0081 \\"Mini Calculator\\", the Canon Pocketronic, and the Sharp QT-8B \\"micro Compet\\". In January 1971, the Sharp EL-8 was close to being a pocket calculator, weighing about one pound, with a vacuum fluorescent display (VFD) and rechargeable NiCad batteries. The EL-8 was the first battery-powered handheld calculator. The concept of a single-chip calculator was conceived by Sharp engineer Tadashi Sasaki in 1968. The first truly pocket-sized electronic calculator was the Busicom LE-120A \\"HANDY\\", the first single-chip calculator to be built, released in February 1971.\\"The one-chip calculator is here, and it's only the beginning\\", Electronic Design, 18 February 1971, p. 34 The Busicom 141-PF desktop calculator, released in March 1971, was the first computing machine to use a microprocessor, the 4-bit Intel 4004 (co-designed by Busicom's Masatoshi Shima). ;LCD calculators In 1971, Tadashi Sasaki began research on the use of LCD displays for calculators at Sharp Corporation. In 1973, Sharp commercially introduced the first LCD calculators.Note on the Liquid Crystal Display Industry, Auburn University, 1995 Cameras ;Analog cameras The Asahiflex II, released by Asahi (Pentax) in 1954, was the world's first single-lens reflex camera (SLR camera) with an instant return mirror.Michael R.

Nishizawa invented other technologies that contributed to the development of optical fiber communications, such as the graded-index optical fiber as a channel for transmitting light from semiconductor lasers. He patented the graded-index optical fiber in 1964. The solid-state optical fiber was invented by Nishizawa in 1964. Hardware elements providing the basis of internet technology, the three essential elements of optical communication, were invented by Jun-ichi Nishizawa: the semiconductor laser (1957) being the light source, the graded- index optical fiber (1964) as the transmission line, and the PIN photodiode (1950) as the optical receiver. Izuo Hayashi's invention of the continuous wave semiconductor laser in 1970 led directly to the light sources in fiber- optic communication, commercialized by Japanese entrepreneurs, and opened up the field of optical communication, playing an important role in the communication networks of the future.S.

Computing ;Digital circuits From 1934 to 1936, NEC engineer Akira Nakashima introduced switching circuit theory in a series of papers showing that two-valued Boolean algebra, which he discovered independently, can describe the operation of switching circuits. Nakashima's switching circuit theory used digital electronics for Boolean algebraic operations.History of Research on Switching Theory in Japan, IEEJ Transactions on Fundamentals and Materials, Vol. 124 (2004) No. 8, pp. 720–726, Institute of Electrical Engineers of JapanSwitching Theory/Relay Circuit Network Theory/Theory of Logical Mathematics, IPSJ Computer Museum, Information Processing Society of JapanRadomir S.

Nakashima laid the foundations for digital system design with his switching circuit theory, using a form of Boolean algebra as a way to analyze and design circuits by algebraic means in terms of logic gates. His switching circuit theory provided the mathematical foundations and tools for digital system design in almost all areas of modern technology, and was the basis for digital electronics and computer theory. Nakashima's work on switching circuit theory was further advanced by Claude Shannon in the United States during the late 1930s to 1940s, and by Goto Mochinori in Japan during the 1940s. The parametron was a logic circuit element invented by Eiichi Goto in 1954.Information Processing Society of Japan – Parametron It was a digital computer element. Parametrons were used in Japanese computers from 1954 to the early 1960s, such as the University of Tokyo's PC-1 built in 1958, due to being reliable and inexpensive, but were ultimately surpassed by transistors due to differences in speed. ;Digital computers The ETL Mark I, Japan's first digital automatic computer, began development in 1951 and was completed in 1952. It was developed by the Electrotechnical Laboratory using relays, based on the switching circuit theory formulated by Akira Nakashima in the 1930s and advanced by Goto Mochinori in the 1940s.【Electrotechnical Laboratory】 ETL Mark I Relay-Based Automatic Computer, Information Processing Society of JapanEarly Computers: Brief History, Information Processing Society of Japan ;Transistor computers The ETL Mark III began development in 1954,Martin Fransman (1993), The Market and Beyond: Cooperation and Competition in Information Technology, page 19, Cambridge University Press and was completed in 1956, created by Japan's Electrotechnical Laboratory.Early Computers, Information Processing Society of Japan It was the first stored-program transistor computer.【Electrotechnical Laboratory】 ETL Mark III Transistor-Based Computer, Information Processing Society of Japan It used ultrasonic delay line memory.

The MARS-1 was capable of reserving seat positions, and was controlled by a transistor computer with a central processing unit consisting of a thousand transistors. It also had a 400,000-bit magnetic drum memory unit, and many registers, to indicate whether seats in a train were vacant or reserved, for communications with terminals, printing reservation notices, and CRT displays. The use of microprogramming in electronic transistor computers dates back to 1961, with the KT-Pilot, an early microprogram-controlled electronic computer developed by Kyoto University and Toshiba in Japan.【Kyoto University,Toshiba】 KT-Pilot, Information Processing Society of Japan ;Office computers Compact office computers originated from Japan in the early 1960s. While American offices at the time ran large minicomputers loaded with business applications, Japanese manufacturers invented highly compact office computers, with hardware, operating systems, peripheral devices and application development languages specifically developed for business applications, playing a big role in Japan's booming economy. The first office computers released in 1961: Casio's TUC Compuwriter, NEC's NEAC-1201 parametron computer, and Unoke Denshi Kogyo's USAC-3010.Office Computers: Brief History, Information Processing Society of Japan In 1967, NEC introduced the NEAC-1240, the world's first small IC (integrated circuit) computer.【NEC】 NEAC-1240, Information Processing Society of Japan ;Computer music In Japan, experiments in computer music date back to 1962, when Keio University professor Sekine and Toshiba engineer Hayashi experimented with the TOSBAC computer. This resulted in a piece entitled TOSBAC Suite. Later Japanese computer music compositions include a piece by Kenjiro Ezaki presented during Osaka Expo '70 and \\"Panoramic Sonore\\" (1974) by music critic Akimichi Takeda. Ezaki also published an article called \\"Contemporary Music and Computers\\" in 1970. Since then, Japanese research in computer music has largely been carried out for commercial purposes in popular music. ;Computer graphics Particularly well known iconic digital computer graphics images include Running Cola is Africa,Running Cola is Africa (retrieved 20 April 2012) by Masao Komura and Koji Fujino, created at the Computer Technique Group, Japan, in 1967.Computer Technique Group (retrieved 20 April 2012) ;Printers The first electronic printer was the EP-101, invented by Japanese company Epson and released in 1968.40 years since Epson's first Electronic Printer, Digital PhotographerAbout Epson, Epson The world's first inkjet printer was Casio's Typuter, released in 1971. Thermal transfer printing was invented by SATO corporation, a Japanese company.Corporate Profile, SATO Group They produced the world's first thermal transfer label printer, SATO M-2311, in 1981. ;4-bit microprocessors The concept of a single- chip microprocessor CPU (central processing unit) was conceived in a 1968 meeting in Japan between Sharp engineer Tadashi Sasaki and an unnamed female software engineering researcher from Nara Women's College. He discussed the concept at a brainstorming meeting that was held in Japan. Sasaki attributes the basic invention to break the chipset of a calculator into four parts with ROM (4001), RAM (4002), shift registers (4003) and CPU (4004) to an unnamed woman, a software engineering researcher from Nara Women's College, who was present at the meeting. Sasaki then had his first meeting with Noyce in 1968. Sasaki discussed the microprocessor concept with Busicom and Intel in 1968, and presented the woman's four-division chipset concept to Intel and Busicom. This provided the basis for the single-chip microprocessor design of the Intel 4004. He was also involved in the development of the Busicom 141-PF desktop calculator which led to the 4004's creation. Sasaki thus played a key role in the creation of the first microprocessor. The first commercial microprocessor, the 4-bit Intel 4004, began with the \\"Busicom Project\\"Federico Faggin, The Making of the First Microprocessor, IEEE Solid-State Circuits Magazine, Winter 2009, IEEE Xplore in 1968 as Masatoshi Shima's three-chip CPU design for the Busicom 141-PF calculator. In April 1968, Shima was tasked with designing a special-purpose LSI chipset, along with his supervisor Tadashi Tanba, for use in the Busicom 141-PF desktop calculator. This later became known as the \\"Busicom Project\\". His initial design consisted of seven LSI chips, including a three-chip CPU. His design included arithmetic units (adders), multiplier units, registers, read-only memory, and a macro-instruction set to control a decimal computer system. Busicom then wanted a general-purpose LSI chipset, for not only desktop calculators, but also other equipment such as a teller machine, cash register and billing machine. Shima thus began work on a general-purpose LSI chipset in late 1968. In 1969, Busicom asked Intel, a company founded one year earlier in 1968 for the purpose of making solid state random-access memory (RAM), to finalize and manufacture their calculator engine. Intel, which was more of a memory company back then, had facilities to manufacture the high density silicon gate MOS chip Busicom required. Shima went to Intel in June 1969 to present his design proposal. Due to Intel lacking logic engineers to understand the logic schematics or circuit engineers to convert them, Intel asked Shima to simplify the logic. Intel wanted a single-chip CPU design, influenced by Sharp's Tadashi Sasaki who presented the concept to Busicom and Intel in 1968. The single-chip microprocessor design was then formulated by Intel's Marcian Hoff in 1969, simplifying Shima's initial design down to four chips, including a single-chip microprocessor CPU. Due to Hoff's formulation lacking key details, Shima came up with his own ideas to find solutions for its implementation. Shima was responsible for adding a 10-bit static shift register to make it useful as a printer's buffer and keyboard interface, many improvements in the instruction set, making the RAM organization suitable for a calculator, the memory address information transfer, the key program in an area of performance and program capacity, the functional specification, decimal computer idea, software, desktop calculator logic, real-time I/O control, and data exchange instruction between the accumulator and general purpose register. Hoff and Shima eventually realized the 4-bit microprocessor concept together, with the help of Intel's Stanley Mazor to interpret the ideas of Shima and Hoff. Busicom's management agreed to the new proposal.Agreement between Intel & NCM The architecture and specifications of the four chips were designed over a period of a few months in 1969, between an Intel team led by Hoff and a Busicom team led by Shima. After Shima went back to Japan in late 1969 and then returned to Intel in early 1970, he found that no further work had been done on the 4004 since he left, and that Hoff was no longer working on the project. The project leader had become Federico Faggin, who had only joined Intel a week before Shima arrived. After explaining the project to Faggin, Shima worked with him to design the 4004 processor, with Shima responsible for the chip's logic. The chip's final design was completed in 1970 by Intel's Federico Faggin and Busicom's Masatoshi Shima. The Intel 4004 was commercially released in 1971, first as part of the Busicom 141-PF calculator and then separately by Intel. The 4004 was also used in other Busicom machines, including an automated teller machine (ATM) and cash register.Masatoshi Shima, IEEE The microprocessor became the basis for microcomputers, which led to the microcomputer revolution. NEC released the μPD707 and μPD708, a two-chip 4-bit microprocessor CPU, in 1971. They were followed by NEC's first single-chip microprocessor, the μPD700, in April 1972,1970年代 マイコンの開発と発展 ～集積回路, Semiconductor History Museum of JapanJeffrey A. Hart & Sangbae Kim (2001), The Defense of Intellectual Property Rights in the Global Information Order , International Studies Association, Chicago a prototype for the μCOM-4 (μPD751), released in April 1973, combining the μPD707 and μPD708 into a single microprocessor. In 1973, Toshiba developed the TLCS-12, the world's first 12-bit microprocessor.Integrated Circuits: 1970s, Semiconductor History Museum of Japan The project began in 1971, when Toshiba began developing a microprocessor for Ford Motor Company's Electronic Engine Control (EEC) project, which went on to utilize Toshiba's 12-bit microprocessor. ;8-bit to 32-bit microprocessors Masatoshi Shima joined Intel in 1972.Shima Masatoshi, Information Processing Society of Japan The Intel 8080, released in 1974, was the first general-purpose microprocessor. The 8-bit Intel 8080 was designed by Federico Faggin and Masatoshi Shima. Shima was employed to implement the transistor-level logic of the 8080. In 1975, Shima joined Zilog, where he designed the Zilog Z80 released in 1976 and the Zilog Z8000 released in 1979. After returning to Japan, Shima founded the Intel Japan Design Center in 1980 and VM Technology Corporation in 1986. At VM, he developed the 16-bit microprocessor VM860 and 32-bit microprocessor VM 8600 for the Japanese word processor market. He became a professor at the University of Aizu in 2000. In 1975, Panafacom (a conglomeration of Fujitsu, Fuji Electric and Matsushita) developed the first commercial 16-bit single-chip microprocessor, the MN1610. According to Fujitsu, it was \\"the world's first 16-bit microcomputer on a single chip\\". In the early 1990s, engineers at Hitachi found ways to compress RISC instruction sets so they fit in even smaller memory systems than CISC instruction sets. They developed a compressed instruction set for their SuperH series of microprocessors, introduced in 1992. The SuperH instruction set was later adapted for the ARM architecture's Thumb instruction set. Compressed instructions appeared in the ARM architecture, after ARM Holdings licensed SuperH patents as a basis for its Thumb instruction set. ;Peripheral chips While working for Intel in the 1970s, Masatoshi Shima designed a number of Intel peripheral chips.

The Namco Galaxian hardware was widely adopted by other arcade game manufacturers during the golden age of arcade video games, including Centuri, Gremlin, Irem, Konami, Midway, Nichibutsu, Sega and Taito. It also inspired Nintendo's hardware for Radar Scope and Donkey Kong as well as the Nintendo Entertainment System home console. Hardware sprite graphics was introduced by Namco's Pac-Man (1980), with the Namco Pac-Man hardware. Instruments Japanese electronic musical instruments were important to the development of electronic music and electronic dance music, such as the Roland TR-808808 (documentary film) and TR-909 drum machines, the Roland TB-303 bass synth, and the Technics SL-1200 direct-drive turntable. ;Electronic organ Yamaha engineer Mr. Yamashita invented the Yamaha Magna Organ in 1935. It was an electrostatic reed organ, a multi-timbral keyboard instrument based on electrically blown free reeds with pickups. ;Electronic drum At NAMM 1964, Japanese company Ace Tone revealed the R-1 Rhythm Ace, the first fully transistorized electronic drum instrument. Created by Ikutaro Kakehashi, who later founded Roland Corporation, the R-1 was a hand-operated percussion device that played electronic drum sounds manually as the user pushed buttons, in a similar fashion to modern electronic drum pads.Matt Dean (2011), The Drum: A History, page 390, Scarecrow Press Since the 1970s, a number of Japanese companies began selling popular electronic drum kits, notably Roland's Octapad and V-Drums, and Yamaha's electronic Yamaha Drums and Yamaha DTX series. In 1997, Roland introduced its TD-10 model, a sound module for its V-Drums. ;Rhythm machines (drum machines) In 1963, Keio-Giken (Korg) released their first rhythm machine, Donca-Matic DA-20, using vacuum tube circuits for sounds and mechanical-wheel for rhythm patterns. It was a floor- type machine with built-in speaker, and featuring a keyboard for the manual play, in addition to the multiple automatic rhythm patterns. Its price was comparable with the average annual income of Japanese at that time. Their efforts were then focused on the improvement of reliability and performance, along with the size reduction and the cost down. Unstable vacuum tube circuit was replaced with reliable transistor circuitry on Donca-Matic DC-11 in the mid-1960s, and in 1966, bulky mechanical-wheels were also replaced with compact transistor circuitry on Donca-Matic DE-20 and DE-11. In 1967, Korg Mini Pops MP-2 was developed as an option of the Yamaha Electone (electronic organ), and Mini Pops was established as a series of compact desktop rhythm machines. Nippon Columbia received a 1965 patent for an electronic automatic rhythm machine instrument. It described it as an \\"automatic rhythm player which is simple but capable of electronically producing various rhythms in the characteristic tones of a drum, a piccolo and so on.\\" At around the same time, Korg also introduced transistor circuitry for their Donca-Matic DC-11 electronic drum machine, some time between 1963 and 1966. The Korg Mini Pops MP-2, MP-5 and MP-7 were released in 1967. Korg's Stageman and Mini Pops series of drum machines, introduced in 1967, were notable for \\"natural metallic percussion\\" sounds and incorporating controls for drum \\"breaks and fill-ins.\\"Russell Hartenberger (2016), The Cambridge Companion to Percussion, page 84, Cambridge University Press The smaller MP-5 had 10 preset rhythms, while the larger MP-7 had 20 preset rhythms. Both had controls for tone, tempo, and volume, while the MP-7 also had dedicated faders for adding ouijada, guiro and tambourine. The controls allowed the user to press more than one preset to combine rhythms. One notable use of a Mini Pops drum machine was by French musician Jean-Michel Jarre, in the final part of his breakthrough album, Oxygene (1976). This rhythm was achieved by overlaying two of the presets. He also used it for his 1978 album Équinoxe. The Donca-Matic is also referenced in Gorillaz' \\"Doncamatic\\" (2010). As the result of their robustness and compact size, rhythm machines were gradually installed on electronic organs as accompaniment of organists, and finally spread widely. Ace Tone drum machines found their way into popular music starting in the late 1960s, followed by Korg and Roland drum machines in the early 1970s.Russell Hartenberger (2016), The Cambridge Companion to Percussion, pages 84–85, Cambridge University Press The first major pop song to use a drum machine was \\"Saved by the Bell\\" by Robin Gibb, which reached No. 2 in Britain in 1969. It used a \\"slow rock\\" rhythm preset on Ace Tone's FR-1 Rhythm Ace.ACE TONE: RHYTHM ACE – FR-1 & FR-2L INFO PAGE, Dubsounds The German krautrock band Can also used a drum machine on their song \\"Peking O\\" (1971), which combined acoustic drumming with Ace Tone's Rhythm Ace drum machine.Rick Moody, On Celestial Music: And Other Adventures in Listening, page 202, Hachette The first album on which a drum machine produced all the percussion was Kingdom Come's Journey, recorded in November 1972 using Ace Tone's Bentley Rhythm Ace.Kris Needs, Suicide – A New York Story, Pop Matters Timmy Thomas' 1972 R&B; single \\"Why Can't We Live Together\\"/\\"Funky Me\\" featured a distinctive use of a Roland drum machineMike Collins (2014), In the Box Music Production: Advanced Tools and Techniques for Pro Tools, page 320, CRC Press and keyboard arrangement on both tracks.

Designed by audio engineer Fumio Mieda, it was introduced in the 1960s by Japanese company Shin-ei, and then released in North America by Univox in 1968. The pedals soon became favorite effects pedals of rock guitarists Jimi Hendrix and Robin Trower. In 1976, Roland subsidiary Boss Corporation released the CE-1 Chorus Ensemble, which was a stand-alone unit of the chorus/vibrato circuit found in the Roland JC-120 amplifier.http://www.bossarea.com/other/ce1.asp The chorus circuit from the amp was put it into a stomp box, making the CE-1 the first chorus pedal.Tribute: Ikutaro Kakehashi and Roland's Impact on Music, Reverb.com The chorus pedal went on to become a standard effects unit among guitarists. Boss effects units subsequently became the de facto standard of guitar effects for decades, with many guitarists relying on them for sonic experimentation. Boss Corporation's DD-2 Digital Delay, released in 1983, was the world's first digital delay effects unit in stomp box form. It uses a custom integrated circuit (IC) chip that was originally developed for Roland Corporation's SDE-3000 rack delay unit. It was succeeded by the DD-3 Digital Delay in 1986.Echoes in Time: The History of BOSS Delay Pedals, Boss Corporation, November 2015 Boss Corporation's RV-2 Digital Reverb, released in 1987, was the world's first digital reverb pedal.

Yamaha's engineers began adapting Chowning's algorithm for use in a commercial digital synthesizer, adding improvements such as the \\"key scaling\\" method to avoid the introduction of distortion that normally occurred in analog systems during frequency modulation. In the 1970s, Yamaha were granted a number of patents, under the company's former name \\"Nippon Gakki Seizo Kabushiki Kaisha\\", evolving Chowning's early work on FM synthesis technology.U.S. Patent 4,018,121 Yamaha built the first prototype digital synthesizer in 1974. Released in 1979,Mark Vail, The Synthesizer: A Comprehensive Guide to Understanding, Programming, Playing, and Recording the Ultimate Electronic Music Instrument, page 277, Oxford University Press the Casio VL-1 was the first commercial digital synthesizer.Impact of MIDI on electroacoustic art music, Issue 102, page 26, Stanford University selling for $69.95. The first commercial FM digital synthesizer was the Yamaha GS-1 in 1980. The mainstream breakthrough for digital synthesis came with the 1983 release of the FM-based Yamaha DX7, one of the best-selling synthesizers of all time. Vowel–consonant synthesis is a type of hybrid digital-analog synthesis developed by Casio and first employed by the early Casiotone keyboards in the early 1980s.Hey, what's that sound: Casiotone, The Guardian ;Sequencer In the early 1970s, Ralph Dyck, a Canadian composer and technologist, developed a prototype digital music sequencer, based on TTL digital circuitry, shift-register memory, and single- channel audio. There were no North American companies interested in his prototype, until Japanese company Roland Corporation took an interest in it. Roland founder Ikutaro Kakehashi saw the prototype, and decided to build a digital sequencer based on his prototype, making a number of major changes. Kakehashi decided to replace the TTL circuity with a microprocessor, replace the small shift-register memory with larger RAM memory, and increase the audio channels from a single channel to eight channels. As Dyck was generally unfamiliar with how to use a microprocessor for a sequencer, Kakehashi hired Yukio Tamada to design and build a microprocessor-based sequencer. Roland switched from discrete circuity to the then brand new Intel 8080A 8-bit microprocessor and increased the memory from 512 bytes shift-register memory to 16 KB RAM memory, allowing storage of over 5,300 notes, which could be entered via the calculator keyboard (the preferred method) or recorded in real-time (not so easy). In 1977, Roland Corporation released the MC-8 Microcomposer, also called a computer music composer by Roland. It was the first standalone, microprocessor-based, digital CV/Gate music sequencer, and an early polyphonic sequencer.Paul Théberge (1997), Any Sound You Can Imagine: Making Music/Consuming Technology, page 223, Wesleyan University PressHerbert A. Deutsch (1985), Synthesis: an introduction to the history, theory & practice of electronic music, page 96, Alfred Music It introduced new features, such as a keypad to enter note information; 16 kilobytes of random access memory which allowed a maximum sequence length of 5200 notes, a huge step forward from the 8–16 step sequencers at the time; the allocation of multiple pitch CVs to a single Gate channel, creating polyphonic parts within the overall sequence; and eight-channel polyphony, allowing the creation of polyrhythmic sequences. The swingy funk element present throughout the Japanese synthpop album Yellow Magic Orchestra (1978) was expressed by Hideki Matsutake programming through subtle variations of the MC-8's input. Giorgio Moroder was another early commercial user of the MC-8, having used it from the late 1970s to the 1980s.Giorgio Moroder Gear Guide, Dolphin Music Other notable users include Ryuichi Sakamoto, Altered Images, Chris Carter, Suzanne Ciani, Chris & Cosey, Kraftwerk, Landscape, The Human League, Martin Rushent, Pete Shelley, Tangerine Dream,Chris Carter, ROLAND MC8 MICROCOMPOSER, Sound on Sound, Vol.12, No.5, March 1997 Richard James Burgess,Dr Ron Moy, Kate Bush and Hounds of Love, page 77, Ashgate Publishing Vince Clarke,The 30 Top Instruments and Innovations of Roland's Ikutaro Kakehashi (1930–2017), Electronic Musician Throbbing Gristle, Isao Tomita, Toto, Yellow Magic Orchestra, and Hans Zimmer. The MC-8 was the first in the Microcomposer family of sequencers, including the Roland MC-4 Microcomposer and Roland MC-202. The Roland MC-8 had a significant impact on electronic music, with the MC-8 and its descendants having more of an impact on electronic music production in the 1970s and 1980s than any other family of sequencers. CV/Gate sequencers such as the MC-8 and MC-4 were eventually succeeded by MIDI sequencers in the 1980s. The Microcomposer series continued with grooveboxes, including the Roland MC-202 (1983), MC-303 (1996), MC-505 (1998), MC-09 (1999), MC-307 (1999), MC-909 (2002) and MC-808 (2006). ;Programmable drum machines (step sequencers) Prior to Ikutaro Kakehashi's founding of Roland Corporation in 1972, Kakehashi had discussed the idea of a programmable drum machine while at Ace Tone, some time between 1967 and 1972. In 1975,Percussion Technology, Part II, SBO Magazine, December 2001 Ace Tone released the Rhythm Producer FR-15 that enables the modification of the pre-programmed rhythm patterns. – Sakata Shokai/Ace Tone Rhythm Producer, a successor of Rhythm Ace after the reconstruction of Ace Tone brand in 1972, provided feature to modify the pre- programmed rhythms. 1978 saw the release of the Roland CR-78, the first microprocessor programmable rhythm machine,Russell Hartenberger (2016), The Cambridge Companion to Percussion, page 85, Cambridge University Press with four memory banks to store user patterns, and controls for accents and muting. Its combination of programmability and familiar preset rhythms made it popular from the late 1970s to the early 1980s, widely adopted by artists such as Blondie, Phil Collins, Ultravox, Underworld, Fatboy Slim, BT, Gary Numan, 808 State, Peter Gabriel, Hall & Oates, Jimmy Edgar, Genesis, Überzone, Brian Ferry, Men Without Hats, John Foxx and OMD. The Roland TR-808, released in 1980, was the first drum machine with the ability to program an entire percussion track of a song from beginning to end, complete with breaks and rolls.Contemporary Keyboard, Volume 7, Issues 1–6, 1981 It also includes volume knobs for each voice, and has bass drum decay controls that could lengthen the sound to create uniquely low frequencies which flatten over long periods, which can be used to create basslines or bass drops.Spin, February 1990, page 24 The TR-808 became one of the most influential inventions in popular music, used on more hit records than any other drum machine, and shaping genres such as dance, electronic, hip hop and pop music. ;Bass synthesizer-sequencers The first bass synthesizer with a music sequencer was the Firstman SQ-01. (\\"Keyboard Report, Oct. '81\\", according to the ) It was originally released in 1980 by Hillwood/Firstman, a Japanese synthesizer company founded in 1972 by Kazuo Morioka (who later worked for Akai in the early 1980s), and was then released by Multivox for North America in 1981.Mark Jenkins (2009), Analog Synthesizers, pages 107–108, CRC Press The most influential bass synthesizer-sequencer was the Roland TB-303, released in 1981, later becoming the basis of acid house music. ;Digital Control Bus (DCB) and DIN sync In 1980, Roland Corporation introduced the Digital Control Bus (DCB) communications protocol, using the DIN sync interface to synchronize different electronic musical instruments. It was introduced with the Roland TR-808 in 1980, considered groundbreaking at the time, followed by other Roland equipment in 1981. It was the precursor to MIDI, which adopted most of its features from the DCB protocol, including the same type of connectors as the DIN sync interface.db: The Sound Engineering Magazine, July 1972, page 32 DCB was introduced in 1980 with the Roland TR-808, followed by other Roland equipment, including the CR-8000, TR-606, TB-303, EP-6060, Jupiter-8, and Juno-60. It uses DIN sync connectors, and DCB functions were basically the same as MIDI, which it was the basis for. DIN sync was introduced by Roland Corporation for the synchronization of music sequencers, drum machines, arpeggiators and similar devices, as part of the Digital Control Bus protocol. It was introduced in 1980 with the Roland TR-808, followed by other Roland equipment in 1981, including the CR-8000, TR-606, TB-303 and EP-6060. It was the basis for the MIDI interface, released in 1983, which eventually superseded it. DIN sync was also adopted by non-Roland instruments, such as Linn Electronics' LinnDrum. ;MIDI (Musical Instrument Digital Interface) In 1981, Roland founder Ikutaro Kakehashi proposed the concept of standardization to Oberheim Electronics, Sequential Circuits, Yamaha, Korg and Kawai. A common MIDI standard was developed, working with Roland's pre-existing DCB as a basis, by Roland, Yamaha, Korg, Kawai, and Sequential Circuits.Holmes, Thom. Electronic and Experimental Music: Pioneers in Technology and Composition. New York: Routledge, 2003 MIDI was publicly announced in 1982.Manning, Peter. Electronic and Computer Music. 1985. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1994. Print. MIDI allowed communication between different instruments and general- purpose computers to play a role in music production. Since its introduction, MIDI has remained the musical instrument industry standard interface through to the present day.The life and times of Ikutaro Kakehashi, the Roland pioneer modern music owes everything to, Fact Kakehashi received the 2013 Technical Grammy Award for the invention of MIDI. ;PCM sampler The first PCM digital sampler was Toshiba's LMD-649,Rockin'f, March 1982, pages 140–141 created in 1981 by engineer Kenji Murata for Japanese electronic music band Yellow Magic Orchestra, who used it for extensive sampling and looping in their 1981 album Technodelic.A Beginner's Guide To YELLOW MAGIC ORCHESTRA, The Electricity Club ;MIDI instruments The first MIDI synthesizers were the Roland Jupiter-6 and the Prophet 600, both released in 1982. The first MIDI sequencer was Roland Corporation's MSQ-700, released in 1983. Sequential Circuits CEO Dave Smith demonstrated MIDI by connecting the Prophet 600 to a Jupiter-6 during the January 1983 Winter NAMM Show. While the Roland TR-808 was fully based on analog synthesis, the Roland TR-909, released in 1983, combined analogue synthesis with digital sampling. It was also the first MIDI drum machine.Butler, Mark Jonathan. \\"Unlocking the Groove: Rhythm, Meter, and Musical Design in Electronic Dance Music\\". Indiana University Press, 2006. . p. 64 Much like the TR-808's importance to hip hop, the TR-909 holds a similar important for electronic dance music, such as techno and house music. For example, the seminal deep house track \\"Can You Feel It\\" (1986) was produced using the Roland Juno-60 polyphonic synthesizer for the bassline and the TR-909 rhythm machine for the drumline.The Mr. Fingers 'Can You Feel It' Bass Line, SynthtopiaNine Great Tracks That Use the Roland TR-909, Complex USB drum MIDI controllers are often designed to resemble popular classic drum machines such as the Roland TR-808 and Akai MPC.. ;Groovebox The Roland MC-202, released in 1983, was the first groovebox. The term \\"groovebox\\" was later coined by Roland Corporation in reference to its successor, the Roland MC-303, released in 1996.Roland MC-202 MicroComposer, Electronic Musician, November 2001 ;Wind synths From the mid-1980s, Akai developed a range of wind synths. Their EWI-1000 wind controller and EVI-1000 valve controller, like the Lyricon, were paired with a dedicated analog, voltage-controlled voice module, the EWV-2000. The EWV-2000 had no MIDI IN, though it did have MIDI OUT. The EWI-1000/EWV-2000 pair were actually a hybrid digital/analog system. Analog signals were derived from the various sensors (e.g., key, bite, bend, etc.) on the EWI-1000 controller unit, then converted to digital signals by a front-end microprocessor in the EWV-2000. These digital signals were then altered by the microprocessor and D/A converted to internal analog control voltages appropriate for the analog synthesizer IC's within the EWV-2000. The D/A used within the EWV-2000 used a very high resolution and conversion rate, such that the responsiveness to the player felt immediate, i.e. \\"analog.\\" The subsequent EWI-3000 and EWI-3020 systems also used this A/D/A scheme within their dedicated tone modules, though these later models of the EWI would support MIDI IN and OUT. ;Linear Arithmetic synthesis Linear Arithmetic synthesis (LA synthesis) is a type of sound synthesis invented by Roland Corporation, introduced with the Roland D-50 synthesizer in 1987. LA synthesis was since used by a number of other Roland equipment, such as the MT-32 sound module in 1987 and the E-20 synthesizer in 1988. The Roland D-50 is a polyphonic 61-key digital synthesizer, produced by Roland and released in 1987. Its features include Linear Arithmetic synthesis, on-board effects, a joystick for data manipulation, and an analogue synthesis-styled layout design. It was also produced in a rack-mount variant design, the D-550 (1987–1990), with almost 450 user-adjustable parameters.Roland D50, Sound on Sound, July 1997 The D-50 saw widespread use in popular music, with a distinctive sound that largely defined popular late 1980s music. Today, the D-50 is still highly popular as affordable vintage synth. It has the highest score by users of all synths at VintageSynth.Roland D50,Score of 4.58 out of 5 by 2936 users, May 2017 The D-50 was the first affordable synthesizer to combine sample playback with digital synthesis, a process that Roland called Linear Arithmetic synthesis. Memory ;Magnetic disks What may have been the first floppy disk, or magnetic disk sheet, was invented by Yoshiro Nakamatsu at the Tokyo Imperial University in 1950.G. W. A. Dummer (1997), Electronic Inventions and Discoveries, page 164, Institute of PhysicsValerie-Anne Giscard d'Estaing (1990), The Book of Inventions and Discoveries, page 124, Queen Anne Press He received a Japanese patent in 1952,YOSHIRO NAKAMATSU – THE THOMAS EDISON OF JAPAN, Stellarix Consultancy Services, 2015 and a 1958 American patent, for a magnetic disk record sheet.Magnetic record sheet, Patent US3131937 Nippon Columbia planned to commercialized his magnetic disc sheet recorder in 1960.Graphic Arts Japan, Volume 2 (1960), pages 20–22 He licensed a number of patents to IBM,Spy, December 1991, page 49 reaching licensing agreements with them in the 1970s. Sony introduced the 3½-inch floppy disk format, called the micro floppy disk. The first commercial micro floppy disk drive was the Sony OA-D30V, released in 1981.SONY Micro Floppydisk Drive – Model OA-D30V Sony's initial 3½-inch floppy disk format was dual-sided and held 875 KB of data storage. In 1990, Toshiba's MK1122FC was the first hard disk drive to use a glass hard disk drive platter, replacing the earlier aluminium platters. Glass platters had several advantages, such as greater shock resistance, compared to aluminium platter.Toshiba MK1122FC, Information Processing Society of Japan ;Random-access memory (RAM) The Toshiba Toscal BC-1411 electronic calculator, which debuted in 1965,Toscal BC-1411 calculator, Science Museum, LondonToshiba \\"Toscal\\" BC-1411 Desktop Calculator introduced an early form of dynamic random-access memory (DRAM) built from discrete components. By 1986, NEC and AMD were manufacturing 32 KB VRAM (Video RAM) chips, compared to Texas Instruments which were manufacturing 8 KB VRAM chips at the time.Advances in Computer Graphics II, page 172, Springer Science+Business Media ;Optical discs The compact disc (CD) format was developed by Sony and Philips in 1979, and commercially released in 1982. The CD-ROM format was developed by Japanese company Denon in 1982. It was an extension of Compact Disc Digital Audio, and adapted the format to hold any form of digital data, with a storage capacity of 553 MiB.Videodisc Update, Volumes 1–3, page 13, 1982 CD-ROM was then introduced by Denon and Sony at a Japanese computer show in 1984. In 1984, Sony introduced a LaserDisc format that could store any form of digital data, as a data storage device similar to CD-ROM, with a larger capacity of 3.28 GiB. The DVD format was developed by Sony, Panasonic and Toshiba in 1994. The same year, Sony and Tatung Company released the first DVD player. ;Flash memory Flash memory (both NOR and NAND types) was invented by Dr. Fujio Masuoka while working for Toshiba around 1980.

Each frame was recorded as a 1mm diameter hologram on a 305mm disc, while a laser beam read out the hologram from three angles. In 1978, Hitachi invented a digital video storage system, which they received a patent for.H04N21/236 patent: Digital video-storage system In the late 1970s to the early 1980s, several types of video production equipment that were digital in their internal workings were introduced, including digital video effects (DVE) units such as the Nippon Electric Corporation (NEC) DVE.

He was the brother and successor of Muhammad Jahan Pahlavan, and was later succeeded by his nephew Nusrat al-Din Abu Bakr. == Background == Qizil Arslan was the son of Eldiguz, a Kipchak military slave of the Seljuk Empire, who rose to prominence and established the Eldiguzid dynasty, and from 1160 had managed to make the Seljuk Sultan of western Iran his puppet, thus taking control over most of western Iran. However, during the reign of his son and successor, Muhammad Jahan Pahlavan (r. 1175–1186), the dynasty was weakened and lost many of its territories, retaining only control of Azerbaijan and Arran. During this period, Qizil Arslan was in charge of Tabriz and its surroundings. == Reign == Qizil Arslan ascended the throne in 1186 after Jahan Pahlavan's death, and assumed the title of al-Malik al-Mu'azzam (\\"the respected king\\"). However, Qizil Arslan immediately came in a conflict with a faction under the leadership of Jahan Pahlavan's widow Inanj Khatun who supported their two sons. Meanwhile, the Seljuk sultan Toghrul III (r. 1176-1194), who had been a mere figurehead under Jahan Pahlavan, freed himself from the grip of the Eldiguzids and withstood them until he was seized by Qizil Arslan's men in 1190, and shortly afterwards imprisoned. Qizil Arslan initially declared the newborn Seljuk prince Sanjar ibn Suleiman-Shah as sultan, but then chose to declare himself as sultan. The following year, however, he was found murdered on his bed, most likely at the instigation of Inanj Khatun. Qizil Arslan's nephew, Nusrat al-Din Abu Bakr, instantly took action after his uncle's death, and ascended the Eldiguzid throne, whilst Inanj Khatun and her two sons were fighting over the control of Persian Iraq with Tughril III, who had managed to escape from imprisonment with the help of Kamal al-Din Abhari. == Court life == Like the rest of the Eldiguzids, Qizil Arslan was an advocate of Persian culture and literature. The poet Athir al-Din Akhsikati, who played a prominent role in the history of Persian poetry, replaced Mujir al-Din Baylaqani as Qizil Arslan's court poet. The prominent poet Khaqani, who had moved from Shamakhi to Tabriz, also became acquainted with Qizil Arslan, and composed poems appreciating the latter. Another poet, Nizami Ganjavi, who is considered the greatest romantic epic poet in Persian literature, dedicated his Khosrow and Shirin first to Muhammad Jahan Pahlavan, and then later to Qizil Arslan. == Notes  References  Sources == * * Category:12th- century monarchs in the Middle East Category:1191 deaths Category:12th-century births Category:12th-century Turkic people Category:Eldiguzids ","title":"Qizil Arslan"},{"id":"54109085","text":"== External links == Volume 581 Category:Lists of 2016 term United States Supreme Court opinions ","title":"List of United States Supreme Court cases, volume 581"},{"id":"54109144","text":"The North Gloucestershire Combination Junior Cup is an annual rugby union knock-out club competition organised by the North Gloucestershire Combination – one of the five bodies that make up the Gloucestershire Rugby Football Union.

Sedon (1820- April 5, 1893) was a noted carpenter and craftsman in nineteenth century Roanoke, Virginia. He is noted for his work in various public buildings, plantation homes, and university structures. \\"He didn't build buildings, he ornamented them. He put the woodwork on Pleasant Grove, he carved the columns, he put the woodwork on West Dormitory at Hollins and a number of other places.\\"Whitwell, W. L. 1989. \\"Overlooked Buildings by the Side of the Road\\". Journal of the Roanoke Valley Historical Society. 13, no. 1: pages 45-46. ==Early life== He was born in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, Germany in 1820, and as a young man immigrated to the United States. According to family lore, Sedon walked from his port of entry in Baltimore, Maryland, to Salem, Virginia, probably along the Great Wagon Road. He married Catherine Statler Sedon (1819 - 1900) of Salem, Virginia, daughter of Abraham Statler (1792 - 1853). ==Professional work== Belle Aire Belle Aire was constructed by Benjamin Deyerle and his carpenter Gustave A. Sedon (also known as \\"Gustavus Sedon) for the Pitzer family in 1849. Its Greek Revival embellishments were influenced by the New England architect Asher Benjamin's publication The Practical House Carpenter of 1830. The L-shaped home is of brick construction with stuccoed Doric pilasters at the corners. Its most recoginizable feature is its 2-story pedimented portico four fluted Doric columns at each level. A kitchen addition replaced the original outbuilding and the side portico has been enclosed. Otherwise, Belle Aire remains much as it was in 1850. Today the home remains as a private residence. It became a Virginia Historic Landmark in 1966 and was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1975. Hollins College The main dorm of Hollins College was decorated and enhanced by Sedon. \\"In Sedon's daybook, his journals, all these bits and pieces of decorations are noted. Seadon (sic) was a very interesting character with a wry sense of humor, even though he had troubles spelling in English. One year just before the Civil War, his journal notes he had to build a walkway to the necessary- a walk way to the outhouse behind the building. The next year he cryptically noted a cover to the walkway to the necessary. Obviously, the young ladies didn't like getting wet as they walked downstairs.\\"Whitwell, W. L. 1989. \\"Overlooked Buildings by the Side of the Road\\". Journal of the Roanoke Valley Historical Society. 13, no. 1: page 46. Sedon's initial contract with the college on the Main Building began in 1860, but was interrupted during the Civil War. He wasn't finally paid for his work until 1866. \\"He was recalled repeatedly through 1879 for completing porches, balustrades, interior woodwork, other improvements and repairs.\\"Pulice, Michael J. 2011. Nineteenth-Century Brick Architecture in the Roanoke Valley and Beyond: Discovering the True Legacies of the Deyerle Builders. Roanoke, Va: Historical Society of Western Virginia, 2011. Pleasant Grove Plantation Sedon also did some major woodwork on the Pleasant Grove (Salem, Virginia). \\"One of the most interesting things about Pleasant Grove is the fine architectural detail on the front which was put out on the house by Gustavus Seadon (sic), a German carpenter/handyman contractor. The house has interesting Ionic columns which Sedon carved and a cast iron balcony up on the top which Sedon or Joseph Deyerle, the owner of the house, ordered from Lynchburg, Virginia or maybe from Richmond. Someday I'll pursue this iron work but its interesting to know that the exact ironwork is on the Witherow house in Lexington, Virginia, on a house on Main Street in Lynchburg, Virginia, and another building in Richmond, Virginia.\\"Whitwell, W.

Salem Presbyterian Church He was also employed to build the Salem Presbyterian Church (Salem, Virginia). \\"The master builder has not been determined but it seems likely that it was Benjamin Deyerle who built many of the finer Greek Revival plantation houses in the area. The church's woodwork is attributed to Gustavia D. Sedon (actually, Gustave A. Sedon), a well-known Roanoke County carpenter. Most of the architectural details are based on plates in ante-bellum builders' handbooks such as those of Asher Benjamin and Owen Biddle, Jr..\\"Salem Presbyterian church.

Harvey's granddaughter, Henrietta Powers Harvey Starkey, contracted Gustavus Sedon for remodeling work and to construct a Greek Revival porch and door case on the I-form in May 1877. The unusual door case at Speedwell is in the style of Sedon's work, who also worked on the 1849 Greek Revival home, Belle Aire, in Roanoke.

The Devonshire biographer Prince (1643–1723) stated:Prince, p.556 \\"What other acts of piety or charity he did, or what brave exploits he performed, or exemplary vertues he was eminent for, I no where find; whatever they were, they are all now swallowed up of oblivion\\". ==Benefaction to Honiton== On 20 July 1524, together with Elizaeus Harding, a priest, he made a \\"large and noble\\" benefaction to the town of Honiton in Devon, about 34 miles north-east of Blagdon. The benefaction was by way of a trust which he established with at least twentyPrince, p.555; The deed stated that when 12 shall have died (thus presumably leaving at least two) 18 more shall be appointed feoffees, all being \\"sufficient, honest and discreet\\" parishioners of Honiton, and endowed with about 19 houses and lands within the parish of Honiton, producing an annual income of £6 10 shillings, to be employed for \\"good and charitable purposes\\" within the town and parish of Honiton and also for maintaining the Chapel of All Hallows in Honiton.

During 50s Ugas fled to north western part of Somalia where was under United Kingdom rule, this followed after Italian imperialist tried too many times to kill him and to got ride off his rule, also it was a time Ugas soldiers were almost defeated and dispersed by Italian army. Upon his arrival in north western regions he was accorded warmth and brotherly reception by tribal elders, intellectuals among other elite individuals and the communities at large. He was one of most kind rulers in all Somali territories, many sub-clans who were not under his rule desired to be under his rule because of his discreet, justice and kind actions. In his long rule dominated most of western part of Bari region Somalia and he was well known ruler of bosaso. Ugas had spent Bosaso most of his time, the town was his base and the barracks of his soldiers. Yasin was one of youngest traditional rulers as he occupied the power on his 20s also he was one of well-educated Somali rulers.

She usually wrote under the pen name Catherine Cole or Catharine Cole. She was one of the earliest professional women newspaper reporters in New Orleans, Louisiana. A champion of women's education and social justice, she also founded the city's first circulating library and helped found a number of other civic institutions. ==Early years and family== Martha Reinhard Smallwood, known as Mattie, was born in Lexington, Missouri to Emma (née Reinhard) Smallwood and W.M. Smallwood, a newspaper editor who moved his family to New Orleans, Louisiana in the 1860s when he took up a position as editor for The Times- Picayune. She published her first piece of writing in the New Orleans Republican at the age of 15. ==Journalism career== Upon leaving school, she went to work for the Republican before moving to San Francisco, California, where she became a journalist for the San Francisco Chronicle. In San Francisco, she married stockbroker Charles W. Field, with whom she had a daughter, Flora, who later became a journalist and wrote at least one play. Shortly thereafter, Field died. Mattie, now widowed, moved back to New Orleans. She moved in with her parents and worked with her father at the Times-Picayune. It was there that she first adopted the pen-name Catharine Cole. In 1881, Pearl Rivers, the owner of the Picayune hired her as a full- time reporter. She was the first woman to hold a staff position on the newspaper. Field wrote a weekly column, \\"Catherine Cole's Letter\\", the topics of which ranged from literary news to personalities, short stories, and travel pieces. She also edited and sometimes wrote (anonymously) another weekly column, \\"Women's World and Work\\". Rivers sent Field to Europe several times to develop material for her columns. Field became known as a champion of women's education and other issues affecting working women. In 1888, she wrote an exposé of the appalling conditions in the Insane Asylum of Louisiana (now known as the East Louisiana State Hospital). She also founded the first circulating library in New Orleans and helped found the New Orleans Training School for Nurses, the Women's Exchange, several local kindergartens, and the local branch of the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. Martha R. Field (1894) In 1892, Field embarked on a tour of Louisiana to report on the state's local attractions, receiving warm welcomes that attested to the wide reach of her vividly written columns. This tour resulted in a number of columns devoted to specific Louisiana parishes. In 1894, she suddenly left the Picayune for its main rival, the Times-Democrat. In 1897, a compilation of Field's work was published under the title Catherine Cole's Book. ==Death and legacy== In the 1890s, Field began suffering from hand tremors, which led to a diagnosis of \\"paralysis agitans\\", now known as Parkinson's disease. In her final years, she was cared for by her daughter, continuing to write and later dictate her columns until the last few months of her life. Four months before she died, she was moved to a Chicago sanatorium, where she died in 1898. Her body was returned to New Orleans for burial. Tulane University holds an archive of Field's newspaper articles along with photographs, scrapbooks, and other material. The archive includes biographical materials written by her daughter. ==Excerpt== The following is from Field's 1888 column on the Insane Asylum of Louisiana: :The method of incarcerating people in the insane asylum is apparently of the easiest. All that appears to be necessary is an order from some court. To this may or may not be appended the certificate of an examining physician. The average formula presented to the asylum for the admission of patients is exceedingly simple. In the usual technical phrases, the judge declares that one so-and-so, giving the name or nickname by which the person has been known, is to be held in the asylum.... If this is within the law, it is a terribly lax and wicked law that works directly in the interest of criminals who desire to get rid of persons without doing actual murder. == References Further reading== *McLaughlin, Joan B., and Jack McLaughlin.

Upper picture shows gliding, where the combustion engine is turned off. Picture below shows coasting where the engine is idling due to a disengaged clutch or the transmission being in neutral. Gliding is an energy-efficient driving mode achieved by turning off the internal combustion engine while the vehicle is still moving in order to save fuel. This is differentiated from coasting, which means running the vehicle in idle mode by disengaging the engine from the wheels, either by disengaging the clutch or setting the transmission or gearbox to neutral position.Konrad Reif, Karl E. Noreikat, Kai Borgeest: Kraftfahrzeug-Hybridantriebe. Gliding and coasting use the accelerated kinetic energy reserve stored in the vehicles mass, i.e. inertia, to keep the vehicle moving. This energy, however, is being lost due to forces that resist movement, such as air-drag, rolling resistance and gravity. The functionality, being an integral concept of hybrid electric vehicles, is performed automatically by the engine controller. For vehicles with a conventional internal combustion engine, coasting can be performed manually; gliding requires having a gear box.bosch-presse.de Erweitertes Start/Stopp-System von Bosch spart noch mehr Kraftstoff, retrieved 14 September 2013 Manual gliding or coasting is illegal in some states. An extra button to stop the engine was shown in 1979 on International Motor Show Germany,\\"IAA 1979 - Porsche 928 S\\", uploaded 11 January 2016 but never became a feature in mass production of any vehicle. In 1980 research was made on the IRVW II. A so-called eClutch (electronic controlled clutch) uses an actuator to disengage the clutch when the driver releases the accelerator.pressrelations.de Die eClutch spart Sprit und erhöht den Komfort, retrieved 19 September 2013 A start-stop system turns the engine off when the vehicle is stopped. Gliding is turning off the engine while the vehicle is still moving. Safety relevant components like power steering or vacuum servo might be required to be electrically powered, but in most vehicles these components are driven by the combustion engine, only. The fuel saving is depending more on the road terrain and traffic conditions. It is assumed to save up to 7% fuel in the NEDC driving cycle; in real road traffic conditions, the savings is estimated to be up to 10%. == Coasting == Coasting is continuing the vehicle to move by disengaging the clutch or by selecting neutral gear, with the proviso that it is not necessary to do so in order to facilitate easy control of the vehicle. Having the clutch disengaged at low speeds or when the engine would provide little or no engine braking is not classified as coasting, it is merely facilitating easier car control. It may also be seen as driving the vehicle at a higher speed than the idle speed of the engine and then disengaging the engine from the wheels by setting the transmission or gearbox to neutral position or disengaging the clutch, maintaining the engine in idle mode.bmwgroup.com Publication to the Press on 6 May 2013, retrieved 15 September 2013porsche.com (PDF; 10,7 MB) 911, retrieved 15 September 2013BMW offers gliding on manual transmissions, Porsche on dual- clutch transmission. == Gliding a conventional vehicle == Pushing the clutch pedal disengages the engine from the powertrain like wheels, drive shafts and gearbox. Releasing the accelerator makes the engine slow down to idle. Turning off the ignition has further effects. Pulling the key causes locking of the steering wheel. Some vehicles switch off headlights or brake lights when the ignition is turned off. After the engine is stopped, applying the brake takes a longer time or giving a few pushes to the brake releases the reserve of the vacuum servo, causing a loss of the brake support. In addition, belt-driven power steering fails immediately. Real hybrid vehicles have electric-driven support of power steering and brake. Bigger engines and engines with a higher compression ratio can cause damage to components of the powertrain at a rough start over clutch from gliding vehicles kinetic power or trailing drag. Using a higher gear decreases the torque force on the powertrain. By turning off the ignition the engine control unit (ECU) needs to detect the engine shafts position. Some ECUs need several rotations of the camshaft to detect ignition and injection timing. Starting the engine in cold start temporarily takes more fuel until operation temperature of the engine is detected by the ECU. Gliding vehicles equipped with torque converter-based automatic transmissions causes damage due lack of lubrication. Also, restarting the engine by clutch from the vehicle's kinetic energy or drag is not possible. It is required to use the starter. Gliding a vehicle with a turbo engine makes the remaining heat from the exhaust cause damage in the bearing of the turbo.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKKT5yNQymQ Unsynchronized transmissions require double clutching and can not get the gear in at differing vehicle and engine speeds. == See also == * Consumption map == References and Remarks == Category:Driving techniques Category:Energy conservation Category:Transport economics ","title":"Gliding (vehicle)"},{"id":"54109502","text":"Beers Brook is a river in Delaware County, New York.

During her time as the White House Press Secretary she did not hold a briefing. She has served as Chief of Staff and Press Secretary for the First Lady of the United States, Melania Trump since 2020, and previously as Press Secretary from 2017 to 2019. She was a press aide to Donald Trump's 2016 presidential campaign, and then a member of the presidential transition team. As Press Secretary, she was the first White House press secretary in American history to hold no press conferences, instead opting for interviews on conservative news outlets. Grisham assumed the role of chief of staff to the First Lady on April 7, 2020. ==Early life== Stephanie Ann Allen was born in either Colorado or Washington to Dave and Elizabeth Ann Allen, the middle child of three. Her family are farmers. She moved with her mother to East Wenatchee, Washington, where she graduated from Eastmont High School in 1994. Her mother has since moved to Nebraska, where she is known as Ann Schroder. Grisham began voting in Arizona as a registered Democrat in 1997. Grisham attended Colorado Mesa University, but did not earn a degree. ==Career== Grisham was the spokeswoman for AAA Arizona in 2007, but was fired within a year after being accused of cheating on expense reports. Grisham was fired from a subsequent job at ad agency Mindspace over plagiarism charges, copying AAA material verbatim into her client's web page. From 2008 to 2010, Grisham worked as a spokeswoman for the Arizona Charter Schools Association. There she met Tom Horne, Arizona's superintendent of public schools. Circa 2011 to 2014, Grisham served as spokeswoman for Tom Horne after he was elected Arizona attorney general. She witnessed the execution of Joseph Wood and controversially claimed that the two hour ordeal had been \\"quite peaceful\\" despite contrary observations. In 2012, Grisham also worked for Mitt Romney's 2012 presidential campaign. After Republican Mark Brnovich defeated Horne in the 2014 GOP primary, Grisham worked as a spokesperson for the Arizona House of Representatives Republican caucus. She revoked the Arizona Capitol Times's press credentials hours after their reporting that the House speaker, David Gowan, had traveled at state taxpayers' expense during his campaign for Congress. Reporters refused to comply, and Gowan rescinded the order. In September 2015, Grisham worked as a press coordinator for Pope Francis's visit to Philadelphia as an independent contractor. Trump campaign and transition Circa August 2015, Grisham started working as a press aide to Donald Trump's 2016 presidential campaign. She helped arrange his campaign stops in Phoenix and around the state and region throughout the primary, a role that quickly expanded to include his rallies around the U.S. Grisham was on state payroll until May 2016, when she took an unpaid leave from the Arizona House of Representatives to work on Trump's campaign. After his victory, Grisham was named a special adviser for operations and served on Trump's transition team. Arizona House speaker David Gowan paid her $19,000 in state salary over an 8-week period while she was serving as a member of the Trump transition team. Trump administration After Trump's January 2017 inauguration, Grisham was named deputy press secretary for Sean Spicer in the West Wing of the White House. In March 2017, First Lady Melania Trump moved her over to the East Wing. A former White House colleague said that the president regretted losing Grisham to the first lady's office because of Grisham's loyalty and skill at handling the press while acting as his traveling press secretary. During that time, she built relationships with many reporters at events. Despite losing Grisham as part of his own staff, President Trump said he was satisfied that the first lady would \\"be in good hands\\". Grisham was described by several sources who had worked with her previously as being \\"highly competent\\" and \\"self-aware\\"; some suggested that she enjoyed \\"trolling the press.\\" The United States Office of Special Counsel stated that Grisham violated the Hatch Act of 1939 following a complaint by Senator Tom Carper. Grisham was accused of using her official Twitter account on July 11, 2018, to tweet out Trump's campaign slogan. Violation of the act is not a crime, but a workplace guideline, and the agency responded by sending Grisham a warning letter. In July 2019, Grisham replaced Sarah Sanders as White House press secretary and White House communications director Grisham's appointment was announced by Melania Trump via Twitter on June 25, 2019. The June 28, 2019 Annual Report to Congress on White House Office Personnel listed Grisham as \\"Assistant to the President and Deputy Chief of Staff for Communications for the First Lady\\", with an annual salary of $183,000.00. On September 5, 2019, the Washington Examiner published an opinion piece written by Grisham and her deputy Hogan Gidley entitled, \\"The Washington Posts lost summer.\\" The authors asserted the Post had not reported on several Trump accomplishments that the paper actually did report. In one instance, the piece linked to a Post story entitled \\"Trump becomes first sitting president to set foot into North Korea\\" as the authors asserted the paper had not reported the event. On September 23, 2019, when asked by the hosts of Fox & Friends if the White House planned to resume its daily press briefing, Grisham said \\"not right now... I mean, ultimately, if the president decides that it's something we should do, we can do that, but right now he's doing just fine. And to be honest, the briefings have become a lot of theater. And I think that a lot of reporters were doing it to get famous. I mean, yeah, they're writing books now. I mean, they're all getting famous off of this presidency. And so, I think it's great what we're doing now.\\" On October 24, 2019, while again appearing on Fox & Friends, Grisham defended Trump's description of \\"Never Trump Republicans\\" as \\"Human scum\\". When asked if Trump should apologize, Grisham said \\"No, no, he shouldn't. The people who are against him and who have been against him and working against his [agenda] since the day they took office are just that. It is horrible that people are working against a president who is delivering results for this country and has been since day one. And, the fact that people continue to try to negate anything he's been trying to do and take away from the good work he's doing on behalf of the American people, they deserve strong language like that.\\" On October 26, 2019, in response to criticism of President Trump by his former chief of staff Gen. John F. Kelly (Ret.) Grisham stated: \\"I worked with John Kelly, and he was totally unequipped to handle the genius of our President.\\" On November 13, 2019, during the testimony of William B. Taylor Jr., Grisham commented that the impeachment inquiry against Donald Trump was a \\"sham hearing\\" that is \\"not only boring, it is a colossal waste of taxpayer time & money.\\" That same month, Grisham claimed that Obama administration officials had left \\"you will fail\\" notes for the incoming Trump administration officials. Numerous Obama administration officials rejected the claim. Grisham ultimately retracted her assertion. In December 2019, Grisham defended President Trump's implication that former congressman John Dingell was in hell. She described Trump as a \\"counter-puncher\\" who was \\"under attack.\\" On April 7, 2020, it was announced that Grisham left her role as White House Press Secretary and returned to the East Wing to serve as Melania Trump's chief of staff, effective that same day. Briefing controversy Grisham extended to more than a year a period during which there were no formal press briefings, such that there were none during her whole tenure as press secretary. However, she appeared on Fox News, Fox Business Network, One America News Network, and the Sinclair Broadcast Group on many occasions during the same period. Anderson Cooper 360° devoted two prime-time segments in one week to question whether taxpayers should pay her $183,000 salary, and her hypocrisy. \\"Miss Grisham has gone from 'we are human beings' to 'they are human scum.' ... It's actually really kind of sad\\". Her \\"unintentionally ironic and deeply hypocritical\\" social media statements and infrequent televised interviews \\"appear meant to defend the president but actually point out the president's own failings.\\" Margaret Sullivan has commented in the Washington Post that Grisham \\"may hold the title but she's not doing the job\\". Authors Don Winslow and Stephen King pledged to donate $100,000 each to charity if Grisham held a one-hour briefing answering questions from the White House press corps. Also, 13 former White House and military press secretaries from three administrations before Trump published a letter calling for the restoration of press briefings. The press briefings never occurred. Incidents of driving while intoxicated On January 9, 2013, Grisham was pulled over for speeding in Gilbert, Maricopa County, Arizona. The officer observed Grisham's signs of intoxication, and she failed a field sobriety test. Grisham denied consuming any alcohol, but said she had taken a Xanax 90 minutes earlier and a Zoloft the prior night. A blood test revealed Grisham's blood alcohol content to be .105 percent, which is above the .08 legal limit in Arizona. She also was found to be driving on a suspended license since August 2012 for failure to answer a traffic citation. In August 2014, Grisham accepted a plea bargain agreement that reduced the charge to misdemeanor reckless driving, plus two years of probation. She returned to court twice for failure to pay the $779 in fines and failure to complete a Mothers Against Drunk Driving program. Shortly after midnight, December 5, 2015, Grisham was arrested again in Phoenix, Maricopa County, Arizona for driving without her headlights and suspicion of driving under the influence; thus violating her probation. Grisham failed to appear at her court hearing on January 19, 2016, whereupon the judge issued a warrant for her arrest. Afterwards, Grisham pleaded guilty. In July 2016, she was ordered into a treatment program and to pay nearly $1,600 in court costs and fines. == Personal life == As Stephanie Ann Sommerville, she married Danny Don Marries in Nevada on April 7, 1997. They met at Mesa State College in Grand Junction, Colorado. They had a son in June 1998, and her husband joined KOLD-TV as a news anchor in Tucson, Arizona, on the day after their son's first birthday. They divorced in 2004. Later in 2004, she subsequently married Todd Grisham, a KOLD sportscaster. They divorced in 2006. Around 2008, she had a second son. ==See also== *Timeline of the Donald Trump presidency ==ReferencesExternal links== * Stephanie Grisham at TucsonSentinel.com * Stephanie Grisham at the Arizona Capitol Times * Stephanie Grisham at The Washington Post - Category:1976 births Category:American press secretaries Category:Arizona Republicans Category:Colorado Republicans Category:Colorado Mesa University alumni Category:First Lady of the United States press secretaries Category:Living people Category:Trump administration personnel Category:White House Communications Directors Category:White House Press Secretaries ","title":"Stephanie Grisham"},{"id":"54109531","text":"The Arthur Hillyer Ford House is a historic building located in Iowa City, Iowa, United States.

At the ends of a huang, there were often abstract heads of animals carved into the jade. During the Eastern Zhou period, block-shaped tiger-like ends were often used in the huang, but these would develop into more-abstract notches.

Harris, 581 U.S. ___ (2017), is a case by the Supreme Court of the United States in which the Court ruled 5–3 that the North Carolina General Assembly used race too heavily in re-drawing two Congressional districts following the 2010 Census.. At issue in particular were the 1st and 12th districts. Voters in Mecklenburg County asserted that the 1st was \\"akin to a Rorschach ink blot,\\" and that the 12th, though 120 miles long, at times \\"averag[ed] only a few miles wide.\\" The 12th had already been a part of several cases that went to the Supreme Court.North Carolina's 12th district was the subject of , , and . North Carolina residents being represented by Harris deemed districts 1 and 12 unconstitutional due to the districts being designed as majority- black districts after the 1990 census. Districts 1 and 12 were drawn with the black voting-age populations (BVAP) being less than fifty percent, following the 2000 census, both districts continued to vote for candidates preferred by black voters in the next five elections. Nonetheless, the Republican-controlled legislature designed a new map after the 2010 census that again redrew districts 1 and 12 as majority black thus prompting the present lawsuit. On February 5, 2016, the three-judge United States District Court for the Middle District of North Carolina found that both districts were unconstitutional due to the predominance of racial considerations in their creation, in which Circuit Judge Roger Gregory was joined by Judge Max O. Cogburn Jr., over the dissent of Judge William Lindsay Osteen Jr. regarding District 12.The Supreme Court, 2016 Term — Leading Cases, 131 Harv. L. Rev. 303 (2017). On December 5, 2016, oral arguments were heard before the Supreme Court, where Paul Clement appeared for the governor, Marc Elias appeared for the voters, and an assistant to the U.S. Solicitor General appeared as a friend in support of the voters. The state argued that the African-American population of the districts was increased in order to comply with the Voting Rights Act of 1965, but the Court found that argument \\"does not withstand strict scrutiny\\" for the 1st district, as its African-American population had previously been less than a majority of its voters, yet African-Americans' \\"preferred candidates scored consistent victories.\\" On May 22, 2017, the Supreme Court delivered judgment in favor of Harris, voting 5–3 to affirm the judgment of the district court. Justice Elena Kagan wrote for the Court, joined by Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor, and Clarence Thomas. Justice Samuel Alito, joined by Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Anthony Kennedy, issued an opinion concurring in the judgment and dissenting in part, arguing that District 12 was constitutional. Neil Gorsuch did not take part in the case, which was argued before he was confirmed to the Supreme Court. When the state redrew the maps from the District Order, they did not use any racial profiling data, but did rely heavily on partisan distributions. The subsequent map has been challenged again, and the case was heard by the Supreme Court as Rucho v.

He was engaged at the Peabody Institute in Baltimore from 1882 until 1885, and at the New England Conservatory in Boston from 1885 until 1887. He was music director of the New England Conservatory from 1890 to 1897. In September 1897, Faelten founded the Faelten Pianoforte- School Teachers Seminary, also in Boston, which by 1998 had 350 pupils. He toured the US and Germany as a concert pianist. He was the author of The Conservatory Course for Pianists, a widely used 16-volume series of textbooks. ==References== * Baker's Biographical Dictionary of Musicians, link Category:1846 births Category:Year of death missing Category:People from Ilmenau Category:People from Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach Category:German pianists Category:Piano pedagogues Category:Place of death missing ","title":"Carl Faelten"},{"id":"54109571","text":"Mallory Brook flows into the West Branch Delaware River by Hawleys, New York. ==References== Category:Rivers of New York (state) Category:Rivers of Delaware County, New York Category:Tributaries of the Delaware River ","title":"Mallory Brook"},{"id":"54109574","text":"Peijnenburg is a surname.

It opened on 1 May 1876 and closed on 6 January 1964. It served Thorner village immediately south of the station as well as the village of Scarcroft a mile to the west. The station was originally called Thorner & Scarcroft, in 1885 it was renamed into Scarcroft for some time before reverting to the old name, and in 1901 the name was finally shortened to Thorner. When opened, the station had only one platform with a brick station building of a typical North Eastern Railway design, similar to the one in Garforth, and a long siding opposite to the platform, but no passing loop. On the down side there was a goods yard, consisting of a loop and three sidings, two of them serving a cattle dock, the third (also equipped with a loop) serving coal drops. A signal box controlled movements in the station and the goods yard. When the line from Cross Gates was doubled in 1901, a second platform with a timber waiting room was built, and the platforms were connected by a metal foot bridge at their southern ends. Until closure, the station remained oil-lit and kept its pre-nationalisation signage. Due to high operating costs compared to low patronage, the line and its stations were earmarked for closure on 23 October 1963 and closed to all traffic on 6 January 1964. The tracks were lifted in 1966. The station area and the goods yard were cleared in the 1970s for new housing, and only the platform edges remain in one of the gardens. The station master's house still stands in the vicinity of the former station. ==ReferencesLines== Category:Disused railway stations in Leeds Category:Beeching closures in England Category:Former North Eastern Railway (UK) stations Category:Railway stations in Great Britain opened in 1876 Category:Railway stations in Great Britain closed in 1964 ","title":"Thorner railway station"},{"id":"54109688","text":"A Bough pot, height with cover- 6 5/8 in.

In 2005, the 7-year old Cutrone started his youth career at the local team GS Parediense. In the summer of 2007, he had trials at Internazionale, Monza, and Milan. On 29 June 2007 he officially joined Milan's academy, where he spent the following ten years, playing through the different age groups up to the Primavera (under-19) team. In March 2015, Cutrone signed his first professional contract with Milan, effective from 1 July 2015 until 30 June 2018. Cutrone received his first ever call-up to the senior team for a home game against Pescara played on 30 October 2016; he was an unused substitute. In January 2017, Cutrone was promoted to Milan's first team. On 21 May 2017, he made his senior debut in the 3–0 Serie A home win against Bologna, coming on as a substitute for Gerard Deulofeu at the 85th minute. In the summer of 2017, Cutrone signed a contract extension until 30 June 2021, while Milan's Chinese-led board of directors spent over €200 million on transfers, acquiring a total of 11 new players, two of which were strikers André Silva and Nikola Kalinić. Initially, in order to increase his playing time, Cutrone had been persuaded to join one of the lower-ranking Serie A clubs yet refused. On 27 July 2017, he was featured in the starting line-up for the first time in a 1–0 away victory over Romanian side Universitatea Craiova in the 2017–18 Europa League qualification. On 3 August, he scored his first goal for Milan in the return match of the same tie, which finished 2–0 for his team. On 20 August, he scored his first Serie A goal in a 0–3 Serie A away win against Crotone. On 24 August, he scored the only goal in a 1–0 away victory over Shkëndija in Europa League play offs, and on 28 September, he scored a last-minute winning goal against Rijeka in the group stage to win the match 3–2 for Milan. Coming on as a substitute in the Coppa Italia match against local rivals, Internazionale, Cutrone scored the winner and his first goal in the Derby della Madonnina. On 28 January 2018, Cutrone scored an opening goal in the home Serie A game against Lazio. Initially, the goal was thought to be a header by the referee and Lazio players alike. However, after the final whistle, it became clear that following a free kick taken by Hakan Çalhanoğlu, the ball instead deflected off his arm straight into the goal. Although it was reported that Cutrone may possibly get a two-match ban for an alleged deliberate handball, an investigation conducted by governing body the FIGC proved that his actions in that episode were unintentional and, therefore, non-punishable. On 10 February 2018, Cutrone scored a brace in a 4–0 away victory over SPAL. In the summer of 2018, Milan's new board of directors decided to increase the team's attacking capability with the signing of a high-profile goalscorer, Gonzalo Higuaín, whom Cutrone first met in 2015 as a fan. Following his arrival, out of all the remaining strikers in the team (namely Nikola Kalinić, André Silva, and Carlos Bacca), Cutrone was the only one to have not been placed on the transfer market. On 31 August 2018, Cutrone came on as a late substitute and scored a last-minute match-winning goal in a 2018–19 Serie A home game against Roma (2–1), helping Milan secure the very first competitive victory in the season. In October 2018, Cutrone extended his contract with Milan until 30 June 2023. On 12 January 2019, Cutrone came on as an extra-time substitute and scored two first-touch goals within just six minutes in an eventual Coppa Italia 2–0 away win against Sampdoria. In the same month, the club opted for an early termination of Gonzalo Higuaín's loan and bought Krzysztof Piątek as a first- choice striker, whose role on the pitch and style of play were considered \\"too similar\\" with those of Cutrone. The team's head coach, Gennaro Gattuso, also refused to pair strikers for tactical reasons and preferred 4–3–3 as his regular starting formation. As a result, Cutrone's playing time and quality of performances continued to decrease, with the player failing to score or assist in his 18 consecutive appearances, mostly as a super-sub. As Milan once again failed to qualify for the Champions League, Gattuso resigned and was replaced by Marco Giampaolo. Despite Giampaolo favoring 4–3–1–2 over any other formation, Cutrone's opportunities at Milan were still considered limited as the new coach sought to pair Piątek with a different type of an attacking partner than him. Wolverhampton Wanderers On 30 July 2019, Cutrone joined Wolverhampton Wanderers on a four-year contract. Cutrone made his league debut for Wolves as a substitute in their opening Premier League fixture of the 2019–20 season, a 0–0 away draw with Leicester City on 11 August, having made his debut appearance (also as a substitute) in the club's 2019–20 UEFA Europa League match away to FC Pyunik of Armenia three days earlier. On 15 August, Cutrone made his full debut for Wolves in a 4–0 home win against FC Pyunik in the 2nd Leg of the UEFA Europa League Third Qualifying Round. Cutrone made his full Premier League debut for Wolves in a 3–2 away defeat to Everton on 1 September. His first goal for Wolves came on 14 September, in a 2–5 home loss to Chelsea in the Premier League. In a 2–0 home success against West Ham United on 4 December, Cutrone scored having only been on the pitch for two minutes as an 84th minute substitute. Fiorentina (loan) Cutrone joined Fiorentina on an 18-month loan deal on 10 January 2020. Two days later he made his debut, as a 75th-minute substitute for Federico Chiesa in a 1–0 home win over SPAL. On 15 January, he scored to open a 2–1 win over Atalanta in the last 16 of the Coppa Italia, also at the Stadio Artemio Franchi. ==International career== Cutrone represented Italy at Italy under-15, under-16, under-17, under-18 and under-19 level, making a combine total of 57 appearances and scoring 27 goals. In particular, he was part of the squad for both the 2015 European U-17 Championship and the 2016 European U-19 Championship. He made his debut with the Italy U21 team on 1 September 2017, in a friendly match lost 3–0 against Spain. Three days later, he played his second match against Slovenia U21 in which he scored his first goal for the side in a 4–1 victory. In March 2018, he was awarded his first senior call-up to the Italian national team, under interim manager Luigi Di Biagio, for Italy's friendlies against Argentina and England later that month. On 23 March, he made his senior international debut in the friendly against Argentina; Italy were defeated 2–0. Cutrone was a member of Di Biagio's 23-man Italy under-21 side for the 2019 UEFA European Under-21 Championship on home soil; He scored in Italy's final group match – a 3–1 victory over Belgium on 22 June, although Italy were eliminated in the first round after finishing second in their group on goal difference behind Spain following a three–way six–point tie with Spain and Poland; Italy also finished as the second–best second–place team, behind France, who progressed to the semifinals of the competition. ==Style of play== Known for his eye for goal, Cutrone has been described as a \\"true number 9\\" by several Italian football pundits. His main playing attributes as a forward are his physical strength, positioning, aerial ability, and heading, as well as his opportunism, movement, and ability to read the game; he has also drawn praise in the media for his work-rate off the ball, while his technique and team play have been cited as areas for improvement, however. Due to his characteristics, he has been compared to former A.C. Milan striker Filippo Inzaghi, who used to train him while working as a coach with the A.C. Milan Youth Sector from 2012 to 2014. Although an avid Milan fan since childhood, he idolized Mattia Destro while playing for Milan Primavera and was also called \\"the young Destro\\" because of their similarities. Other players he idolizes are Andrea Belotti and Álvaro Morata, with the latter praising Cutrone for his performances in 2018. Although he is naturally right-footed, he is capable of striking the ball well with either foot. Apart from his regular position as a central striker, Cutrone has also been used as a makeshift left winger by his former Milan coach Gennaro Gattuso, in a role similar to that of Mario Mandžukić at Juventus. Cutrone is also capable of playing alongside another attacking teammate in a 4–4–2 formation, balancing between the roles of a centre-forward/striker and a second striker. Former Milan forward Daniele Massaro likened Cutrone to himself in 2019, also referring to the latter as a \\"supersub,\\" due to his penchant for scoring decisive goals after coming off the bench. ==Personal life== On 14 March 2020, Cutrone tested positive for COVID-19, amid its pandemic in Italy. On 5 April, it was reported that Cutrone fully recovered. ==Career statistics== Club {  style=\\"text-align: center;\\" +Appearances and goals by club, season and competition - ! rowspan=\\"2\\" Club ! rowspan=\\"2\\" Season ! colspan=\\"3\\" League ! colspan=\\"2\\" National Cup ! colspan=\\"2\\" League Cup ! colspan=\\"2\\" Continental ! colspan=\\"2\\" Other ! colspan=\\"2\\" Total - !Division!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals -  rowspan=\\"4\\" Milan 2016–17  rowspan=\\"3\\" Serie A 1000colspan=\\"2\\"—colspan=\\"2\\"—0010 - 2017–18 281052colspan=\\"2\\"—136colspan=\\"2\\"—4618 - 2018–19 34332colspan=\\"2\\"—5410439 - ! colspan=\\"2\\" Total !63!!13!!8!!4!!0!!0!!18!!10!!1!!0!!90!!27 -  Wolverhampton Wanderers 2019–20 Premier League 1220021100colspan=\\"2\\"—243 - Fiorentina (loan) 2019–20 Serie A 19421colspan=\\"2\\"—colspan=\\"2\\"—colspan=\\"2\\"—215 - ! colspan=\\"3\\" Career total !94!!19!!10!!5!!2!!1!!28!!11!!1!!0!!135!!35 } International {   - !National team!!Year!!Apps!!Goals -  rowspan=\\"2\\" Italy - 201810 - ! colspan=\\"2\\" Total10 } ==Honours== Italy U19 *UEFA European Under-19 Championship runner-up: 2016 ==ReferencesExternal links== * *Patrick Cutrone international caps and goals at figc.it *Instagram Profile Category:Living people Category:1998 births Category:Sportspeople from Como Category:Association football forwards Category:Italian footballers Category:Italy under-21 international footballers Category:Italy youth international footballers Category:Italy international footballers Category:A.C.

Stolpersteine is the German name for stumbling blocks collocated all over Europe by German artist Gunter Demnig. They remember the fate of the Nazi victims being murdered, deported, exiled or driven to suicide. Generally, the stumbling blocks are posed in front of the building where the victims had their last self-chosen residence. Until now in Croatia there has been only one collocation of Stolpersteine—in 2013 in the Adriatic town Rijeka (, in Italian: Fiume). From 1466, this town was under Habsburg rule for four and half centuries, at last with two-thirds of its inhabitants being of Italian descent. Thereafter, Rijeka was independent for some years. From 1924 to the end of WW2, the city belonged to Italy. The name of the Stolpersteine in Croatian is Kamen spoticanja, and in Italian: pietre d'inciampo. == Rijeka == {class=\\" sortable toptextcells\\" style=\\"width:100%\\" !class=\\"hintergrundfarbe6 unsortable\\" width=\\"120px\\" Stone !class=\\"hintergrundfarbe6\\" style =\\"width:18%;\\" Inscription !class=\\"hintergrundfarbe6\\" data-sort-type=\\"text\\" style =\\"width:22%;\\" Location !class=\\"hintergrundfarbe6 unsortable\\" style=\\"width:100%;\\" Life and death - 120px120px   HERE LIVED EUGENIO LIPSCHITZ BORN 1883 ARRESTED MARCH 1944 INTERNED IN RISIERA DI SAN SABBA DEPORTED 1944 AUSCHWITZ MURDERED AT AN UNKNOWN DATE  Ante Starčevića 5  ' was born on 5 May 1883 in the Western Hungarian city of Sümeg. His family moved to Fiume/Rijeka in 1894. He established himself as a retailer of gadgets and jewelry and married Zseni Zipszer, also called Giannetta. The couple had three children, the sons Arturo (1914–1980) and Efraim (born 1919) and the daughter Magda (also Maddalena), who later-on was married to Enrico Heimler and took his name. Both sons were able to emigrate to Palestine in time. His daughter Magda, together with her husband, her mother-in-law and her sister- in-law, escaped to Central Italy in September 1943, and thereafter to Switzerland where she could survive the Holocaust. Jeremus Eugenio Lipschitz was interned by the Mussolini regime 28 July – 22 December 1940 in the Campagna internment camp. After his release he was not allowed to return to Fiume for a certain period. He and his wife were arrested in Fiume by German forces in March 1944, first deported to Risiera di San Sabba, a German concentration camp in Trieste, later to Auschwitz Birkenau concentration camp. There, both were murdered at an unknown time. His sister Giuseppina and her husband Adolfo Simkovits were also murdered in Auschwitz.\\"Lipschitz, Giuseppina\\", CDEC Digital Library, retrieved on 6 May 2017. Lipschitz's report on the internment in Campagna was translated by his daughter from Hungarian to Italian and published in 2001 in book form.

It was the only Garratt type locomotive in the Netherlands. It was built by Henschel with builder number 22063 in 1931. It entered service in the same year. Ir. D. Verhoop, in collaboration with Hanomag, is the likely designer of the locomotive. Builder number 10758 was reserved by Hanomag. The locomotive was completed after the take-over of Hanomag by Henschel. The locomotive was designed for operation on the line Maastricht - Vaals, which required a locomotive with at least 5 coupled axles. A normal locomotive would experience too much rolling resistance in the many curves on this line, which were typical tramway curves of small radius. A normal locomotive would cause considerable wear on the line. A Garratt type locomotive had several other advantages as well: a short and wide boiler is possible, the center of gravity is low, and moveable parts are readily accessible. In exception to the general type, this Garratt locomotive had internal cylinders, and is more in line with other tramway locomotives in The Netherlands. The coal and water storage is located on the bogies. The water tanks were located below the running boards, to ensure pressure as applied to all axles even when running empty. Additionally, this allowed for unobstructed views from the cabin. The valve gear is of the Verhoop system. The two traction bogies, which were in fact locomotives without a boiler and cabin, were in their basic design and layout identical to B locomotives LTM 21-35. Pistons, valves and rods were identical. Additional coal storage was located at the rear of the cabin in two coal storage bins. In between these storage bins a door was located that allowed access. The locomotives had four types of brakes: an automatic Knorr air pressure brake system (for use with railroad equipment), a Hardy vacuum brake (used in combination with the Knorr system when pulling LTM equipment), a direct working air pressure switching brake controlled from two control points on both sides of the cabin, a hand brake to be operated together with a steam brake in case of emergencies. A servo motor controlled the steam valves instead of a more common mechanical system. On the steam piston a glycerine buffer was available, which was used to hold the piston in place. The locomotives were sold to Dotremont in Maastricht in 1938. Technisch Bureau Groen (The Hague) bought the machine in 1940, and sold the machine to a client in Germany in 1941. ==References== Category:Garratt locomotives Category:Henschel locomotives Category:Standard gauge locomotives of the Netherlands Category:Steam locomotives of the Netherlands ","title":"LTM 51"},{"id":"54109979","text":"Coulter Brook flows into the Little Delaware River by Bovina Center, New York. ==References== Category:Rivers of New York (state) Category:Rivers of Delaware County, New York Category:Tributaries of the Delaware River ","title":"Coulter Brook"},{"id":"54109983","text":"Stayce D.

The album contains 11 tracks featuring re- recorded versions of songs from their 2014 self-titled EP, namely: Hither, Run, Images, and Fools. Settled, the lead single, was released on April 11, 2016, and was followed by Open Road which was released on December 4, 2016. A vinyl version was released on March 27, 2018 by indie label Offshore Music. == Background == The band is known for its upbeat and cheerful sound, but frontman Kian Ransom states that Traces will be different as it will be darker compared to their self-titled EP. Lily and Kian also said that Traces will have a more complex sound. “More complex rhythms, transitions, and the occasional fusion of other genres...it’s always good to change it up a little. That means you’re growing as an artist,” says Kian. Traces is a testament to their maturity as musicians and complexity as songwriters, opting for a more diverse content. The album would also be a very personal one for each of the members. Drummer Redd Claudio says, \\"You’ll find that each track is based on a separate experience, it’s just narrating those experiences. That for me, shows how personal it is in that sense.\\" \\"[The album] is about our lives, heartbreak, the things that we celebrate, the things that we go through, happiness. Anything that we go through in our lives, that's what Traces is all about, and all the memories,\\" said Jermaine. The band was also trying to be unpredictable in their songwriting, especially with Traces. Jermaine Ochoa Peck says, \\"With the music industry in general, this wave of sound is different from how it sounded before. I think we also just rode that wave. People are starting to be more open to the different sound…indie folk. It’s not only us, there’s a lot of other bands, who are also getting into this kind of music as well.\\" == Release == The band officially released the album on May 20, 2017, and hosted an album launch at The Palace Pool Club in Bonifacio Global City with musical acts Tandems ’91, Tom’s Story, and Ourselves the Elves. Indie musician Reese Lansangan was originally scheduled to perform at the launch, but due to commitments with MCA Music's GetMusic Indie-Go, she wasn't able to join and was replaced instead by Tandems '91. == Track listing References== Category:2016 albums Category:The Ransom Collective albums ","title":"Traces (The Ransom Collective album)"},{"id":"54110008","text":"Charles R. \\"Chuck\\" Malone (born c. 1954) is a former Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Alabama, from Tuscaloosa County, Alabama. == Career == Malone was in private practice in Tuscaloosa for twenty years, until his election to the Tuscaloosa County Circuit Court in 2000.

Formed in 1981 initially as Johnny Bravo and his Whirling Dervishes, the band shortened its name in 1983 to Whirling Dervishes. Their sound has been described as a combination of Roxy Music, The Stooges, Nine Inch Nails and The Wonderstuff. ==Career== Dazzo, Ardrey, Paola and Siegel met while attending Westfield High School while Heer and Bryan studied at neighboring Union Catholic High School. All performed in various bands during those formative years, except for Dazzo who served as roadie for Ardrey's group, the Shattered Five. The band is known for its dark pop songs and benefitted greatly from airplay on WHTG-FM in Eatontown, New Jersey, which helped popularize the group at the Jersey Shore and beyond. The band toured the East Coast during the mid-1980s through the early 1990s, but performed most frequently at rock clubs in the New York and New Jersey area such as Stone Pony, Brighton Bar, The Limelight, Danceteria, CBGB, China Club, Kat Club, Fastlane, Court Tavern, the Melody, the Roxy, and the Green Parrot. The original line-up, Bob Ardrey (guitar, vocals), Don Dazzo (lead vocals), Dan Paola (guitar, vocals), Billy Siegel (keyboards, vocals, producer), Jerry Heer (bass) and John Bryan (drums, percussion), is still together today. They have also worked with engineer Alan Douches, known for his engineering and mastering skills with Aerosmith, Steve Taylor and George Benson. Record releases Best known for their perennial Christmas classic cover of \\"You're A Mean One, Mr. Grinch,\\" the band released two vinyl EPs, History Kicks You (1983) and Affordable World (1985); one CD EP, Wish it Would Snow (1992), independently, re-released in 1994 on Ignition with bonus tracks and again in 1995 as Grinch on Continuum/Universal; and one full-length CD album, Strange and Wonderful (1992). Television and film Signed in 1991 to Herb Alpert's publishing arm of A&M; records Rondor Music, the band wrote and recorded the theme song to NBC's short-lived television show The Adventures of Mark and Brian. In 1990, the band released the film Thin Mints, written and directed by Dazzo, produced and edited by Heer, starring Ardrey and Fred Harlow, with a score by Siegel and Ardrey, and with Whirling Dervishes' songs prominently featured. Everlounge In 1994, Dazzo and Siegel formed the group Everlounge, later joined by Ardrey, inspired by the New York- and Los Angeles-based lounge music scene. Occasionally, Whirling Dervishes still play local shows in the New Jersey area. == External links References== Category:American power pop groups Category:Alternative rock groups from New Jersey Category:Musical groups established in 1981 Category:Musical groups from New Jersey Category:People from Westfield, New Jersey ","title":"The Whirling Dervishes (band)"},{"id":"54110112","text":"Romain Wacziarg (born 1970) is an American economist.

Hinnant, a pathologist, was strangled by a homeless man who had been squatting in the hospital. ==Background== Kathryn Hinnant worked at the New York University Medical School as a researcher in cytopathology. She had an office on the fourth floor of the pathology wing at Bellevue. Steven Smith was a homeless man with a history of psychiatric problems and an addiction to cocaine. He had twice been admitted to Bellevue in late 1988 after ingesting rat poison but had been released. He subsequently began squatting in the hospital, dressing as a doctor in order to blend in. ==Murder== On 7 January 1989, Hinnant was in her office at Bellevue preparing a lecture. Smith entered her office, beat her, raped her, and strangled her with a cord. Her body was found at 6 the next morning by her husband and a hospital staff member. She was five months pregnant at the time of her death. ==Investigation and trial== Mayor Edward Koch referred to the case as \\"the number one to be solved\\"; 50 detectives were reportedly tasked with catching the killer, whom the media had taken to referring to as the \\"Beast of Bellevue\\". Several days later, Smith was located and arrested with Hinnant's credit cards. Smith was tried on a charge of first-degree murder and presented an insanity plea. The jury did not believe his defense and found him guilty, resulting in a sentence of life in prison. Smith stated he would have preferred to receive the death penalty. ==Legacy== The murder was one of several incidents of security breaches at Bellevue Hospital, dating back decades. Hinnant's family sued Bellevue for wrongful death, alleging negligence on the part of the hospital in failing to provide adequate security. The family refused a proposed settlement but the case was ultimately decided against them. ==NotesSources== * Category:1989 murders in the United States Category:Crimes in New York City Category:American murder victims ","title":"Death of Kathryn Hinnant"},{"id":"54110123","text":"Hughes Brook flows into the Little Delaware River east of Delhi, New York.

While some researchers consider this group to be an extinct subfamily of bears, a variety of morphological evidence links amphicynodontines with pinnipeds, as the group were semi-aquatic otter-like mammals. In addition to the support of the pinniped–amphicynodontine clade, other morphological and some molecular analyses support bears being the closest living relatives to pinnipeds. According to McKenna and Bell (1997) Amphicynodontinae are classified as stem- pinnipeds in the superfamily Phocoidea. Fossils of these mammals have been found in Europe, North America and Asia. Amphicynodontines should not be confused with Amphicyonids (bear-dogs), a separate family of Carnivora which is a sister clade to arctoids within the caniforms, but which may be listed as a clade of extinct arctoids in older publications. ==Systematics== * Subfamily †Amphicynodontinae (Simpson, 1945) ** †Amphicticeps (Matthew and Granger, 1924) *** †Amphicticeps makhchinus (Wang et al., 2005) *** †Amphicticeps dorog (Wang et al., 2005) *** †Amphicticeps shackelfordi (Matthew and Granger, 1924) ** †Parictis (Scott, 1893) *** †Parictis primaevus (Scott, 1893) *** †Parictis personi (Chaffee, 1954) *** †Parictis montanus (Clark & Guensburg, 1972) *** †Parictis parvus (Clark & Beerbower, 1967) *** †Parictis gilpini (Clark & Guensburg, 1972) *** †Parictis dakotensis (Clark, 1936) ** †Kolponomos (Stirton, 1960) *** †Kolponomos newportensis (Tedford et al., 1994) *** †Kolponomos clallamensis (Stirton, 1960) ** †Allocyon (Merriam, 1930) *** †Allocyon loganensis (Merriam, 1930) ** †Pachycynodon (Schlosser, 1888) *** †Pachycynodon tedfordi (Wang & Qiu, 2003) *** †Pachycynodon tenuis (Teilhard de Chardin, 1915) *** †Pachycynodon filholi (Schlosser, 1888) *** †Pachycynodon boriei (Filhol, 1876) *** †Pachycynodon crassirostris (Schlosser, 1888) ** †Amphicynodon (Filhol, 1881) *** †Amphicynodon mongoliensis (Janovskaja, 1970) *** †Amphicynodon teilhardi (Matthew and Granger, 1924) *** †Amphicynodon typicus (Schlosser, 1888) *** †Amphicynodon chardini (Cirot and De Bonis, 1992) *** †Amphicynodon cephalogalinus (Teilhard, 1915) *** †Amphicynodon gracilis (Filhol, 1874) *** †Amphicynodon crassirostris (Filhol, 1876) *** †Amphicynodon brachyrostris (Filhol, 1876) *** †Amphicynodon leptorhynchus (Filhol, 1874) *** †Amphicynodon velaunus (Aymard, 1846) ==References== Category:Miocene carnivorans ","title":"Amphicynodontinae"},{"id":"54110161","text":"Meon Valley Stud is a horse breeding farm, based at Dean Farm, Bishop's Waltham in Hampshire. Founded in 1980 by Egon Weinfeld, it has produced numerous major winners. ==History== Dean Farm had been the training base of Bill Wightman, best known for handling the steeplechaser Halloween. After Wightman left the farm after the Second World War the land was used for arable farming before being acquired in 1979 by Egon Weinfeld (1928-2013) who founded the Meon Valley Stud. Weinfeld was an Austrian-born businessman who had come to Britain as an eleven-year-old refugee and had established Helena Springfield Ltd as a successful textile business. John Gosden described him as \\"an extraordinary breeder and a brilliant man\\". The stud's homebred horses raced in the colours of Helena Springfield Ltd, which were black with white spots and a white cap. After Weinfeld's death in 2013 the management of the stud was taken over by his son Mark. The stud sells most of its produce at auction but often keeps back the best of its fillies as potential broodmares. ==Foundation mares== The stud's four foundation mares were Home And Away, One In A Million, Odeon and Reprocolor who were purchased for Weinfeld by the bloodstock agent Richard Galpin. One in a Million was bought for 18,500 guineas at Tattersalls Houghton Sale in October 1977. She was an outstanding racehorse who won the Nell Gwyn Stakes, 1000 Guineas and Coronation Stakes in 1979. Her descendants have included Milligram, One So Wonderful, Kissogram (Sun Chariot Stakes), Speedy Boarding, Alnasr Alwasheek (Dante Stakes), Relatively Special (Rockfel Stakes), Sun Boat (San Diego Handicap) and Anapurna (Epsom Oaks). One in a Million died in 1992 at the age of 16. Odeon was purchased for 38,000 guineas at the same sale at which One in a Million was acquired. She won the Galtres Stakes and finished second in the Fillies' Mile, Nassau Stakes and Park Hill Stakes. She was the dam of Shirley Superstar who produced the Oaks winner Lady Carla. Reprocolor was acquired at auction by Weinfeld for 25,000 guineas in December 1977. She won the Pretty Polly Stakes, Lingfield Oaks Trial and the Lancashire Oaks. She became an outstanding broodmare whose descendants have included Colorspin, Bella Colora (Prix de l'Opéra), Izzi Top, Cezanne, Kayf Tara, Opera House, Stagecraft (Prince of Wales's Stakes), Caspar Netscher (Gimcrack Stakes, Mill Reef Stakes, Mehl- Mulhens-Rennen, Nearctic Stakes), Suez (Dick Poole Stakes), Alessandro Volta (Lingfield Derby Trial), Alkaadhem (Jebel Hatta), Necklace, France (Tetrarch Stakes), Torch Rouge (Arlington Handicap), Zee Zee Top (Prix de l'Opéra), Jazzi Top (Prix de la Nonette) and Telecaster (Dante Stakes). Reprocolor died in 2008 at the age of 32. Home and Away was bought for 60,000 guineas at the 1978 Houghton Sale. She was unraced. She was the female-line ancestor of Noushkey (Lancashire Oaks) and San Sebastian. ==Major winners== Meon Valley Stud has produced the following Group 1 winners: c = colt, f = filly, g = gelding { border=\\"1\\" cellpadding=\\"0\\" style=\\"border-collapse: collapse; font- size:90%\\" - eee;\\"  style=\\"width:35px;\\" Foaled  style=\\"width:120px;\\" Name  style=\\"width:35px;\\" Sex  style=\\"width:580px;\\" Group 1 Wins -  1983  Colorspin  f  Irish Oaks -  1984  Milligram  f  Queen Elizabeth II Stakes -  1988  Opera House  c  Coronation Cup, Eclipse Stakes, King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes -  1989  Cézanne  g  Irish Champion Stakes -  1993  Lady Carla  f  Epsom Oaks -  1994  One So Wonderful  f  International Stakes -  1994  Kayf Tara  c  2× Ascot Gold Cup, 2× Irish St Leger -  1994  San Sebastian  g  Prix du Cadran -  1999  Zee Zee Top  f  Prix de l'Opéra -  2001  Necklace  f  Moyglare Stud Stakes -  2008  Izzi Top  f  Pretty Polly Stakes, Prix Jean Romanet -  2012  Speedy Boarding  f  Prix Jean Romanet, Prix de l'Opéra -  2016  Anapurna  f  Epsom Oaks, Prix Du Royallieu } ==References== Category:Companies established in 1980 Category:Horse farms in the United Kingdom Category:Companies based in Hampshire Category:Racehorse owners and breeders ","title":"Meon Valley Stud"},{"id":"54110173","text":"Daniel Farke (; born 30 October 1976) is a German professional football manager and former player who played as a forward.

He co-wrote the title track with Anders Bruus for the Danish rock band The Breakers. \\"I'm Comin' Back\\" was a track Van Zandt wrote for Southside Johnny and the Asbury Jukes' 1991 release Better Days. Van Zandt said that \\"it's one of my favorite lyrics that I've ever written.\\" \\"Blues Is My Business\\" is a cover of the Etta James song. The band tried it out for their BluesFest performance and Van Zandt decided that he liked his arrangement enough to include it on the album. \\"I Saw the Light\\" was a song he started writing for Richie Sambora and Orianthi but did not finish, but rediscovered it while working on Soulfire and decided to finish it for himself. \\"Some Things Just Don't Change\\" is another one of Van Zandt's favorite tracks that he wrote for Southside Johnny that was originally released on This Time It's for Real. \\"Love On the Wrong Side of Town\\" was also on that album and Van Zandt co-wrote it with Bruce Springsteen. \\"The City Weeps Tonight\\" was an outtake from his debut album, 1982's Men Without Women. \\"It was going to be the first song on my first solo album. I was going to do a chronological history of rock 'n' roll with my own records but the concept changed and I got political. It remained three-quarters finished all these years, but I always liked it. I love doo-wop so this was a great way to get that onto the record.\\" Van Zandt also covered James Brown's \\"Down and Out in New York City\\" but incorporated jazz elements into it. Since he never had a blues song on a record, he wanted to experiment with it. \\"Standing in the Line of Fire\\" is a song that Little Steven co-wrote with Gary U.S. Bonds for the album of the same name. He thought that he could not do better than the way it turned out on Bonds's album so he challenged himself to make a new arrangement of it. \\"Saint Valentine's Day\\" is a cover of the Cocktail Slippers' 2009 hit, originally titled \\"St. Valentine's Day Massacre\\". Van Zandt originally intended for it to be for Nancy Sinatra, but the session never happened, so he did a similar arrangement for the Cocktail Slippers that is similar to how he intended it to be for Sinatra. Sopranos creator David Chase liked the song so much that they decided to do a rock and roll version of it for the soundtrack to the film Not Fade Away. \\"I Don't Want to Go Home\\" is a cover of the Southside Johnny track from album of the same name. It was the first song he ever wrote. While he was performing with The Dovells, he intended to give the song to Ben E. King but did not have the courage to.

The line connected collieries along its route. The BW&LR; changed its name to the West Yorkshire Railway at the same time. The line was double track, just over five miles in length, between junctions at Lofthouse and Methley. The connected Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway and the North Eastern Railway were brought in to joint ownership of the line in 1864, and the line opened in 1865; passenger traffic was delayed, starting in 1869. A variety of passenger train services operated over the route, but the line closed to passenger trains in 1957, and completely in 1981. ==Origin== The Bradford, Wakefield and Leeds Railway had opened in 1857, forming a link between Wakefield and Leeds. It was worked by the Great Northern Railway, and gave that company a much improved access to Leeds.Martin Bairstow, The Great Northern Railway in West Yorkshire, Wyvern Publications, Skipton, 1982, , pages 6 and 63 Although worked by the GNR, the company took the initiative in seeking extensions to its network, and in the 1863 session of Parliament the BW&LR; sought powers for a branch from Lofthouse to Methley and another to Low Moor, and to change its name to the West Yorkshire Railway. The Lofthouse to Methley branch and change of title were sanctioned by an Act of 21 July 1863, but the Low Moor branch was rejected. The Act also authorised running powers over the North Eastern Railway from Methley to Castleford (and towards York) and over the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway from Pontefract to Leeds.John Wrottesley, The Great Northern Railway: volume I: Origins and Development, B T Batsford Limited, London, 1979, , page 101Ernest F Carter, An Historical Geography of the Railways of the British Isles, Cassell, London, 1959, page 257.Donald J Grant, Directory of the Railway Companies of Great Britain, Matador Publishers, Kibworth Beauchamp, 2017, , page 369David Joy, Regional History of the Railways of Great Britain: volume VIII: South and West Yorkshire, David St John Thomas, 1984, , pages 114 and 115K Field and J P Wilson, The Junctions at Methley, in the Railway Magazine, April 1957 The L&YR; and the North Eastern Railway had strongly resisted the authorisation of the line, but an agreement was made with those companies to admit them to joint ownership of the line, in return for their not opposing the absorption of the Leeds, Bradford and Halifax Junction Railway and the Bradford, Wakefield and Leeds Railway by the GNR.Joy, page 85 By an Act of 23 June 1864, the Methley Railway (as the branch had now been named) transferred to the joint ownership of the West Yorkshire Railway (former BW&LR;), L&YR;, and NER. The L&YR; and the NER subscribed £25,000 of capital each, so that the Joint Line capital of £75,000 was equally shared. A Methley Joint Committee was set up, each company appointing two directors: the first meeting was on 8 August 1864. Stations were to be at Stanley and Methley, also at Lofthouse, (at the junction with the main line). In addition, sidings were provided at Lofthouse Alum Works, and at several collieries; the line was double track. A fixed toll on all traffic would be paid into a joint fund. Up to 18 March 1867 each company had subscribed £34,500 for the joint line. The railway diverged from the West Yorkshire Railway at Lofthouse [North] junction; at first the access was from the north alone. The line was 5 miles 3 chains long, and joined the former York and North Midland Railway line (now North Eastern Railway) at Methley Joint Line junction. At Methley High Level junction, close to the eastern extremity of the line, it bifurcated, platforms being provided on both forks at Methley station, and a 30 chain spur connected with the L&YR; at a junction at Methley named Lofthouse junction. ==Opening and operation== The double track line needed three Board of Trade inspections before it was approved, in 1865. On 19 September it was passed for passenger traffic. Goods traffic was begun in June or August 1865.Wrottesley, page 102 The GNR's account for working the line for the first half of 1867 was £510. The NER stated that the charges were 20% too high, to which the GNR retorted that if the NER desired to work the line for 20% less it was welcome to do so. Passenger operation was delayed despite agitation from the local population: it was not until 1 June 1869 that a passenger service was run. Lofthouse South fork was not in regular passenger use in its early years.H C Casserley, Britain's Joint Lines, Ian Allan, Shepperton, 1968, , page 156A Haigh, Railways in West Yorkshire: A New Edition, Dalesman Books, Clapham, 1978, , page 11 Platforms were provided at Methley on the fork to Lofthouse Junction (L&YR;), but no regular passenger service appears to have used them. ==WYR absorbed by the Great Northern Railway== The West Yorkshire Railway (formerly Bradford, Wakefield and Leeds Railway) was absorbed by the Great Northern Railway, effective from 1 January 1865. This was confirmed by an Act of 5 July, and the one third share of the Methley Joint line passed to the GNR from 5 September 1865.Wrottesley, page 103 The GNR soon obtaining running powers over the NER as far as Milford junction, and started a goods service to that point from Bradford on 8 June 1866. ==Train services== The GNR began running a passenger service over the Joint Line from 1 May 1869, and from 13 May GNR trains started to work through to the NER station at Castleford from both Wakefield and Leeds. In reply the Midland Railway commenced a Leeds-Castleford service on 1 August, but despite the more direct route it was soon taken off. An even shorter-lived experiment was a through GNR service from Bradford to York via the Methley Joint Line, which was operated only in the summers of 1876 and 1877. The Methley Joint station at Methley was the third in this locality, its nearest namesake being Methley Junction on the L&YR; Pontefract line. At its eastern end the MJR crossed the floodplain of the River Calder, and inundation of the tracks was a perpetual hazard; in 1892 it was recommended that the line be lifted by as much as four feet for a length of 500 yards.John Wrottesley, The Great Northern Railway: volume III: Twentieth Century to Grouping, B T Batsford Limited, London, 1981, , page 64 By an agreement of 20 October 1870, the GNR was allowed 33% of gross receipts for working the Methley Joint passenger service, altered on 1 January 1885 to 1s per mile for \\"all trains necessary to the branch\\". Several new collieries were opened along it and suitable sidings put in.John Wrottesley, The Great Northern Railway: volume II: Expansion and Competition, B T Batsford Limited, London, 1979, , page 22 ==Infrastructure changes== The signalling was altered for interlocking in preparation for installation of the block system, ready for two new services beginning on 1 May 1876. A south curve at Lofthouse, making a triangular junction there, and a new joint station were brought into use on 1 May 1876.Joy, pages 256 and 257 Lofthouse Joint station was built on the curve, and was located on a 1 in 90 gradient. The station and curve carried a service of six trains each way on weekdays and two on Sundays between Wakefield (Kirkgate) and Milford Junction via Methley.Wrottesley, volume 2, page 21 Lofthouse Joint station was renamed Lofthouse in the February 1881 timetable, and again renamed Lofthouse & Outwood in July 1888. After the withdrawal of the North Eastern Railway York to Leeds service via Methley, the portion of the Methley branch between Methley Joint Junction and Methley Junction fell into disuse for passenger services, but the track was not removed until 1943. On 4 October of that year the Methley Junction L&YR; station was closed. . ==After 1923== At the grouping of 1923 the line passed to the joint ownership of the LMS and the LNER. The passenger service using the Lofthouse south curve was discontinued from 17 June 1957. On 5 May 1958 diesel multiple unit trains began working from Leeds Central over the Methley Joint Line into Castleford Central (as the NER station had been renamed), and then continued to Pontefract. This service was discontinued from 2 November 1964, when the Methley Joint Line was closed to all passenger traffic.Joy, pages 166 and 256 The western end of the line from Lofthouse junctions to Newmarket (Silkstone) Colliery was closed completely from 5 April 1965; the colliery traffic was accessible to and from the Methley end only; the connection at Methley to the L&YR; was closed from 27 March 1967, leaving only the route to the former NER line. The line closed completely on 23 February 1981.Bairstow, page 64 ==Locations== Main line * Lofthouse South Junction; on BW&LR; * Lofthouse Joint station; opened 1 May 1876; renamed Lofthouse 1881; renamed Lofthouse and Outwood 1888; closed 17 June 1957; * Lofthouse East Junction; * Stanley; opened 1 May 1869; closed 2 November 1964; * Newmarket Colliery West Junction; * Newmarket Colliery East Junction; * Methley South Junction; * Methley NE Junction.

It was inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in 2019. ==Background== In 2014, Sri Chinna Jeeyar came up with the idea to commemorate the 1000th anniversary of Sri Ramanuja's teachings by building the Statue of Equality. The statue is constructed on an estimated 34 acres in Hyderabad, India. It consists of a 216 foot tall statue of Ramanuja and is surrounded by 108 Divyadesams (model temples) and includes an educational gallery. The project budget is 1000 crore rupees. The foundation stone for the Statue of Equality was laid by Chinna Jeeyar. The statue was built by Aerosun Corporation in China before being shipped to India. It is made of panchaloha, a combination of gold, silver, copper, brass and titanium. The statue relies on donations to fund its construction. ==Design== The Statue of Equality is constructed on a base building which will be 16.5 m tall. The base will contain a meditation hall where a small statue of Ramunuja made of 120 kg of gold, representing the years he lived, will be installed and will be created using panchaloha. The ground floor will be 6,000 square metre and will depict Ramanuja's life and philosophy. The temple will be located on the 27,870 square metre second floor with a 120 kg statue of Ramanuja, representing the years he lived, meant for daily worship. The 1,365 square metre third floor will include a Vedic digital library and research center. An Omnimax theatre featuring life stories of Ramanuja and a library of ancient Indian texts are also planned. This project has been designed by D.N.V.Prasad Sthapathy under enlightenment of H.H.Sri Chinna Jeeyar Swamiji. ==ReferencesExternal links== * Category:Buildings and structures in Telangana Category:Outdoor sculptures in India Category:Colossal statues in India Category:Tourist attractions in Hyderabad, India ","title":"Statue of Equality (Ramanuja)"},{"id":"54110271","text":"North Falls is a waterfall located in the Silver Falls State Park at the east end of the city of Salem, in Marion County, in the U.S. state of Oregon. It is located in a privileged area on the west foothills where Mount Hood National Forest meets with the Middle Santiam Wilderness. Several prominent waterfalls are located in the Park along Trail of Ten Falls: South Falls, Drake Falls, Lower South Falls, and Winter Falls—among others. == Location == North Falls is created along the course of North Fork of Silver Creek and it sits on the east section of Silver Falls State Park Trail of Ten Falls, along North Falls Trail, approximately a quarter mile of Upper North Falls. It received its name because it is the primary waterfall along North Silver Creek. == Description == North Falls is the third tallest along the Trail of Ten Falls and the only one in the park that can be viewed from highway 214. The falls drops in a straight plunge down approximately channeled through a narrow crack in the basaltic bedrock to a steeply slanted protrusion of basalt which causes splashing of the cascade into the pool. == Trail == The Silver Falls area contains multiple popular hiking trails. The North Falls trail is a 1/4 mile trail with a moderate elevation gain approximately 80 stairs that lead behind North Falls through a large cutout on the rock. It continues west and roughly follows North Creek through the Canyon Trail, passing several waterfalls, including Twin Falls, Middle North Falls, Drake Falls, and Lower North Falls. On the opposite direction from the North Falls trailhead is the short, flat trail to Upper North Falls. The North Falls trail passes behind North Falls in massive undercut cliff that extends back from the falls for at least 100 feet. The ceiling of therecess runs anywhere from 20 to approximately as much as 75 feet above the trail as it passes behind the waterfall. The large size of the undercut rock allows the roar of the falls to be considerably amplified. == See also == * List of waterfalls in Oregon == References == Category:Parks in Marion County, Oregon Category:Waterfalls of Oregon ","title":"North Falls"},{"id":"54110272","text":"Michael Cahalane (born 17 June 1995) is an Irish hurler who plays as a left corner-forward for club side Bandon and at inter-county level with the Cork senior hurling team. ==Playing career== College Cahalane first came to prominence as a hurler with Hamilton High School in Bandon. Having played at every grade, he was a forward on the college's senior teams that played in the Harty Cup. Club Cahalane joined the Bandon club at a young age and played both hurling and Gaelic football in all grades at juvenile and underage levels, enjoying some championship success. On 9 October 2016, he scored three points from play as Bandon defeated Fermoy in the premier intermediate hurling championship final. A week later, Cahalane was a non-playing substitute when Bandon defeated Rockchapel by three points in the county intermediate football championship final. Inter-county Minor Cahalane first played for Cork at minor level in 2013. A dual player with both the hurlers and Gaelic footballers, his season ultimately ended without success with defeats by Waterford and Tipperary. Senior Cahalane made his senior debut for Cork on 15 February 2014, replacing Aidan Walsh in the 46th minute of a National League game against Limerick at Páirc Uí Rinn. During the latter stages of the league campaign, Cahalane complained of a breathing issue that was bothering him. Further tests ruled out asthma, however, an ultrasound revealed that he had an enlarged heart and had picked up a viral infection. The condition threatened his hurling career and he played no part in Cork's league or championship campaigns over the subsequent two seasons. On 12 March 2017, Cahalane made his return to the Cork senior team, coming on as a substitute for Alan Cadogan in the 31st minute of a National League defeat of Waterford. He made his championship debut later that season, scoring a vital goal in a four-point Munster Championship quarter-final defeat of Tipperary. On 9 July 2017, Cahalane won his first Munster medal following a 1-25 to 1-20 defeat of Clare in the final.

He is best known for sailing alongside Thomas Tew and Henry Avery. ==History== Thomas Tew's first voyage from Rhode Island, around the Cape of Good Hope, and into the Indian Ocean to plunder Moorish ships using Madagascar as a staging base was wildly successful. Want had been Tew's first mate aboard the Amity for that 1692 cruise. Want had previously been a buccaneer, serving with George Raynor aboard the Batchelor's Delight when Raynor sailed it to Charles Town in the Province of South Carolina. Like Raynor, Want had married and settled down in South Carolina but had roots in New England. Tew's crew convinced him to go back for a second cruise to try repeating his prior success. This time Want took command of his own 6-gun 60-man Spanish brigantine named Dolphin, fitted out in Philadelphia, and he obtained a privateering commission from the governor to cover his activities. In 1694 Tew and Want sailed out alongside another Providence companion, Joseph Faro in the Portsmouth Adventure. Once the group arrived near Mocha in 1695, they were joined by Thomas Wake and William May, where they also met Henry Every. They waited for the Mughal Empire's treasure-laden convoy to pass; most of the Mughal ships slipped by in the night but the pirates caught two stragglers. Tew's Amity sailed ahead to attack the smaller Fateh Mohammed but a cannon shot killed Tew early in the battle. Once the others defeated and looted Fateh Mohammed, they turned on the larger Gunsway, a personal treasure ship of Emperor Aurangzeb. Tew's Amity under ship's master John Ireland sailed back to Adam Baldridge's pirate trading post near Madagascar. Wake's Susannah was too slow and missed the battle. Want's Dolphin proved slow and unseaworthy - \\"an ill sayler\\" - and was abandoned. Every took its crew aboard his ship Fancy and burned the empty Dolphin. Faro and Every caught the Gunsway, with May's Pearl in tow, though Faro never engaged them. Want's crew served alongside Every's during the battle and received the same shares of Gunsway's immense treasure. Want remained aboard Every's Fancy, making his way through the Persian Gulf then back to South Carolina via the Bahamas. Records indicate he had another privateering commission in 1696, this time from South Carolina. ==See also== *Pirate Round - later name for the route Tew and others took from New England, around southern Africa, and into the Indian Ocean via Madagascar ==NotesReferences== Category:Year of birth missing Category:Year of death missing Category:American pirates Category:17th-century pirates Category:Pirates Category:Piracy in the Indian Ocean ","title":"Richard Want"},{"id":"54110349","text":"Dry Brook flows into the East Brook north of Walton, New York.

He was installed by King Solomon I of Imereti as Prince- regnant of Guria, in 1756, in place of Mamia, who had been involved in a revolt against Solomon four years earlier. Mamia was able to convince King Heraclius II of Kakheti and the Ottoman pasha of Akhaltsikhe to help him recover the throne and Giorgi was deposed in his favor. In 1765, Hasan Pasha of Akhaltsikhe, responding to Mamia's involvement in Solomon's anti-Ottoman endeavors, restored Giorgi in Guria. Giorgi then joined the Imeretian pretender Prince Teimuraz and duke of Racha in an Ottoman-sponsored revolt against Solomon, but they suffered defeat at Chkhari in 1768. In 1770, Solomon took advantage of the ongoing Russo-Turkish War of 1767–1774, crossed into Guria, where he defeated an Ottoman force marching from Batumi to Imereti, and, in 1771, deposed Giorgi in Mamia's favor. It was not until 1776 that Giorgi, exploiting the increasingly deteriorating relations between Solomon and Mamia, staged a coup against his brother and once again seized power in Guria. He then reconciled with Solomon and joined his expedition against the Ottoman-controlled Lower Guria and Adjara, once belonging to the Gurieli in 1784. The campaign ended in disaster for the Georgian rulers in March 1784, resulting in Guria's permanent loss of the Kobuleti area to the Ottoman Empire. Later that year, following Solomon's death, Giorgi Gurieli supported David II's bid for the crown of Imereti and fought the Ottoman-supported pretender, Prince Kaikhosro Abashidze. Giorgi ruled Guria for more years until 1788, when he, already seasoned and weary of political instability in his principality, abdicated in favor of his eldest son, Simon II Gurieli. == Family == Giorgi Gurieli was married to Princess Mariam (died ), probably daughter of Alexander V of Imereti. He had six children: * Prince Simon II Gurieli (died 1792), Prince-regnant of Guria; * Prince Vakhtang II Gurieli (died 1814 or 1825), Prince-regnant of Guria; * Prince Kaikhosro IV Gurieli (died 1829), prince-regent (1792–1809); * Prince Levan, married to Princess Elisabed Anchabadze; * Princess Agata (fl. 1837), married to Prince Aleksandre Machutadze and then, Prince Davit Mikeladze; * Prince Davit (died c. 1833), married to Princess Elene, daughter of Grigol Dadiani of Mingrelia. In the 1820s, he was an opponent of the Russian hegemony over Guria and died in exile in the Ottoman Empire. David's two sons—Grigol (1819–1892) and Levan (1824–1888) were generals in the Russian army.

On 13 March 1975 a unit from the UVF's Belfast Brigade attempted to bomb the Catholic-owned Peter Conway's bar on the Shore Road in Greencastle, Belfast. The bomb exploded prematurely, killing a Catholic civilian woman and one of the UVF bombers.http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/cgi- bin/dyndeaths.pl?querytype=date&day;=13&month;=03&year;=1975 ==Background== By 1975, the religious-political conflict in Northern Ireland known as \\"the Troubles\\"— was more than six years old. By the start of that year, over 1,200 people had been killed in the conflict and thousands more were injured. On 10 February 1975, the Provisional IRA and the British government entered into a truce and restarted negotiations. The IRA agreed to halt attacks on the British security forces, and the security forces mostly ended its raids and searches. However, there were dissenters on both sides. Some Provisionals wanted no part of the truce, while British commanders resented being told to stop their operations against the IRA just when—they claimed—they had the Provisionals on the run. Loyalists especially the UVF were immediately suspicious about the truce between the government and the IRA and believed the government was about to \\"sell them out\\" to a United Ireland. Their response to the truce was to intensify their campaign against the Irish Nationalist and Catholic community. ==Attack== http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/cgi- bin/dyndeaths.pl?querytype=date&day;=29&month;=03&year;=1974 On 13 March 1975 a UVF unit drove to Conway's bar on the Shore Road with a 50 lb gas cylinder bomb. The unit included UVF members Eddie Kinner, Martin Snodden and George Brown. UVF intelligence told the unit that an IRA meeting was taking place inside the bar at 20:30 that night. The bomb had a 40-second fuse on it and the unit was instructed to leave the bomb in the bar hallway, light the fuse and then leave. The unit placed the bomb in the hallway but as they did so somebody opened the door and knocked the bomb over and setting it off prematurely. One of the UVF volunteers George Brown was killed in the blast and a Catholic woman Marie Doyle (38) was also killed. Eddie Kinner was badly injured, about 15 people drinking inside the bar were also injured in the blast. An angry crowd identified and chased Martin Snodden on to the M2 motorway and badly beat him before he was rescued by military police just before the mob was about to hang him from a bridge with rope. Both Snodden and Kinner received lengthy sentences for their part in the bombing.http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1994-11-28/news/9411280222_1_northern- ireland-protestant-shankill-road/2 ==Most bombed pub in Belfast?== Journalist Peter Taylor wrote in his book about Loyalists that Conway's Bar along with the Europa Hotel probably hold the record for being the most bombed building in Northern Ireland. *In August 1972 the UVF bombed Conway's bar, badly injuring several people *Almost exactly a year earlier on the 29 March the UVF bombed the pub killing two Catholic civilians.https://cain.ulster.ac.uk/cgi- bin/dyndeaths.pl?querytype=date&day;=29&month;=03&year;=1974 *The 13 March 1975 bomb by the UVF which killed a civilian & a UVF member.https://cain.ulster.ac.uk/cgi- bin/dyndeaths.pl?querytype=date&day;=13&month;=03&year;=1975 *18 June 1976 - The UVF exploded a no-warning bomb at Conway's Bar. A Catholic civilian was injured. ==Aftermath== A month later on 5 April in retaliation for the Conway's bombing Provisional IRA volunteers using the covername Republican Action Force bombed a pub on the Shankill Road killing five Protestants including one UDA member in the Mountainview Tavern bombing and a further 60 people were injured in the attack. In an interview with journalist Peter Taylor for a documentary series on Loyalist paramilitaries Martin Snodden expressed regret at his part in the Conway bar attack that killed the Catholic woman Marie Doyle, saying he only intended to target Republican paramilitaries. Kinner was less sympathetic and believed only sectarian attacks of such nature could make the IRA end their campaign. ==See also== *Hillcrest Bar bombing *Step Inn bombing *Chlorane Bar *Ramble Inn ==Further reading== * Henry McDonald & Jim Cusack - UVF: The Endgame * Peter Taylor Loyalists * Henry McDonald & Jim Cusack - UDA: Inside the Heart of Loyalist Terror ==Sources== * CAIN project ==References== Category:Explosions in 1975 Category:Ulster Volunteer Force actions Category:History of County Antrim Category:History of Belfast Category:Terrorist incidents in the United Kingdom in 1975 Category:Improvised explosive device bombings in Northern Ireland Category:Terrorist incidents in Northern Ireland Category:Mass murder in 1975 Category:March 1975 events in the United Kingdom Category:1975 crimes in the United Kingdom Category:1975 in Northern Ireland Category:Attacks on bars in the United Kingdom Category:Building bombings in the United Kingdom ","title":"1975 Conway's Bar attack"},{"id":"54110589","text":"The 1913 Presbyterian Blue Hose football team represented Presbyterian College during the 1913 college football season.

The speech, which praised freedom of speech and democracy, drew the ire of Chinese netizens, state media, as well as the Chinese Students and Scholars Association at the University of Maryland. ==Event== The commencement ceremony was held at the Xfinity Center on Sunday, May 21, 2017 for the awarding of 6,051 bachelor's degrees, 1,732 master's degrees, and 585 doctoral degrees to the class of 2017. The commencement included speeches by university president Wallace Loh, businessman and UMD alumnus Mark Ciardi, Shuping Yang, and fellow graduate Gregory Ridgway. During Yang's speech, she contrasted air quality in China with that of the US, using difference in air quality as a metaphor for her feelings toward freedom of speech and democracy. She described her surprise at seeing a performance of Twilight: Los Angeles, 1992, a one-woman play in which topics of racism, sexism, and politics were openly discussed; she had previously been convinced that this was not possible, as she had believed that \\"only authorities owned the narrative\\". She further mentioned student protests, the election in 2016, and the voting system of the United States. Her speech ended with the passage: > \\"Democracy and free speech should not be taken for granted. Democracy and > freedom are the fresh air that is worth fighting for. Freedom is oxygen. > Freedom is passion. Freedom is love. And as a French philosopher Jean-Paul > Sartre once said, 'freedom is a choice.' Our future is dependent on the > choices we make, today and tomorrow. We are all playwrights of the next > chapters of our lives. Together we write the human history. My friends, > enjoy the fresh air and never ever let it go.\\" After the speech, university president Wallace Loh, a native of Shanghai, returned to the lectern on the verge of tears and commented, \\"[the speech] was most inspiring. And like you and your parents, I also am an American by choice, and you have expressed some of the deepest feelings I feel for this country.\\" ==Reactions==  Chinese Students and Scholars Association  The speech stirred a sharp reaction among students in the Chinese community of the University of Maryland, notably from members of the pro-government Chinese Students and Scholars Association (CSSA). The CSSA produced a video called \\"#Proud of China UMD\\" that alleged that Yang's speech included \\"false statements and rumor\\". Zhu Lihan (), a former president of the CSSA at the University of Maryland, stated in state-owned tabloid Global Times: \\"Insulting the motherland to grab attention is intolerable. The university's support to such critical speech is not only ill-considered, but also raises suspicion about other motives.\\"  State media Chinese media Global Times described the speech as \\"anti-Chinese\\". An anonymous student quoted by Global Times stated of Yang, \\"She has rights and freedom to express such opinion in private. Saying this in a public speech shows her being immature and mean.\\" The People's Daily, also run by the Communist Party, similarly attacked Yang's speech.  Chinese netizens Yang's speech was met with an uproar online, and her Sina Weibo account was promptly filled with angry comments. Netizens called her a \\"traitor\\", a \\"liar\\", and expressed disbelief that an American university would allow such a speech to be made. Some urged others to \\"dig up dirt\\" on Yang's family, and the home address of her family was shared widely online. Many comments criticised the comparison of the air quality between the U.S. and China, though commentators observed that this was mainly a political metaphor. Netizens found out that she grew up in Kunming, leading the Kunming city government to respond that the city's air was \\"more than likely to be 'sweet and fresh'\\" given that authorities report that the air quality there is \\"excellent\\".  University of Maryland  In response to the furor, the University of Maryland issued a statement supporting Yang's \\"right to share her views and her unique perspectives\\", adding that \\"respectfully engaging with those whom we disagree are essential skills, both within university walls and beyond\\". The university stated that Yang was selected to deliver the commencement speech by a committee, on the basis of her performance as a \\"top student\\", and stated that it \\"proudly supports\\" her right to freedom of speech. ==Apology== In what The Guardian called an \\"apparent attempt to defuse the situation\\", Yang posted an apology online. ==Interpretation== Commentators viewed the furor as emblematic of the tension between the values of Western universities, which espouse freedom of speech as essential to academic inquiry, and the mainland Chinese people who increasingly study at these institutions, partly as a result of Chinese government policy to \\"assemble broad numbers of students abroad as a positive patriotic energy\\". In the wake of the controversy following Yang's speech, a BBC editorial referred to these \\"angry student patriots\\" as China's \\"new Red Guards\\". ==ReferencesExternal links== * Video of the ceremony on the University of Maryland YouTube channel Category:University of Maryland, College Park Category:2017 in Maryland Category:May 2017 events in the United States Category:Human rights in China Category:Environment of China Category:Anti-American sentiment in China Category:2017 speeches ","title":"Shuping Yang commencement speech controversy"},{"id":"54110678","text":"Rhene formosa is a jumping spider species in the genus Rhene that lives in Guinea.

Ellul wrote the book in 1951; it was published in English translation in 1970, and then in French in 1975 as Sans feu ni lieu : Signification biblique de la Grande Ville. == Synopsis == Where is the city's foundation? All mythologies speak of an original garden, returning to which is man's only desire. The city is the world of man: his creation (made in his image) and his pride because it reflects his culture and his civilization. It is also a place of absurdity, of chaos, and of man's power over Nature and man, a place of slavery par excellence. Ellul recounts, through the course of the Bible, the city's origins. God places man in a garden because this is his natural place, the place to which he is best adapted. But man wished to separate from God and determine his own destiny. All mythologies herald man's return to nature, a return to the original state. Inversely, the Bible anticipates a perfect city, the New Jerusalem. \\"This shows that, out of love, God revises his own plans, taking into account the history of men, including their maddest revolts.\\"Frédéric Rognon, Jacques Ellul : Une pensée en dialogue, éd. Labor et Fides, 2007, p.86 . \\"Cela signifie que, par amour, Dieu révise ses propres desseins, pour tenir compte de l'histoire des hommes, y compris de leurs plus folles révoltes.\\" Thus, from Genesis to Revelation, Ellul brings to life the rhythm of the city and unmasks the illusions thence attached, navigating within the Christian dialectic between the fall of man and redemption in order to give meaning to the present situation of people, who depend on the big city for everything they do. == Exegesis == Ellul gives an exegesis of the city in the Bible. This is not a formalist or structuralist exegesis, but a traditional exegesis, which is to say it seeks to present the text as it appears today and in its entirety. This means that the author, here, seeks within the Bible all passages which relate to the city, as the basis for a biblical definition of this place. If the author \\"hears\\" the more sophisticated meanings given by his contemporaries, he nevertheless considers that one \\"cannot honestly interpret a text outside its content and the meaning which it gives itself\\". He therefore refuses to divide the text into independent fragments, instead taking them in their entirety; he considers the text to be essentially dialectical, implying that its meaning arises within an ensemble of contradictory statements. So doing, Ellul does not seek to explain why the Bible says what it says on the subject of cities, but to show what it says. == Critique of the city == It is within the framework of his critique of technique (see The Technological Society) that Ellul approaches the city. In effect, according to him, the city is the place where technique becomes system, preventing man from living in freedom. And according to Ellul, this freedom arises in work within proximity to God, and later in the perfect example of Jesus Christ. Thus, \\"if one follows Ellul, humanity's freedom of choice seems singularly limited: return to the path of the Christian God or accept the dissolution of humanity. Strictly speaking this conception of liberty is a negation of autonomy, is a heteronomy. Facing this dilemma to which Ellul condemns us, how can we raise a challenge, how can we find a truly autonomous liberty, which is to say find its true characteristics and true limits?\\".Jean-Pierre Jézéquel, Jacques Ellul ou l’impasse de la technique, Revue du Mauss, 2010. \\"si l’on suit Ellul, la liberté de choix de l’humanité semble singulièrement restreinte : retrouver le chemin du Dieu chrétien ou se résigner à la disparition de l’humanité. Stricto sensu cette conception de la liberté est une négation de l’autonomie, c’est une hétéronomie. Face au dilemme auquel nous condamne Ellul, comment relever le défi, comment retrouver une liberté véritablement autonome, c’est-à-dire trouvant en elle-même ses propres déterminations et ses propres limites ?\\" This remark, published in the Revue du MAUSS, critiques Ellul's theistic thrust, but also shows the extent to which man wants to live without God, considering that true liberty cannot exist in relation to a creator. The city is precisely the place created by man. It is the affirmation of man taking his life into his own hands, independently of God; it is the expression of man's rebellion against God. God has placed man at the garden, a place adapted to him. But man refuses the life for which God has destined him, which is unsettled, and men have gathered and organized themselves in order to depend no longer on nature. This political project (see Ellul 1965, L'Illusion politique), the management of the metropolis, underlies the city: security, survival, commerce, collective living... But this city, created to strengthen human solidarity and protect man against natural aggressions, becomes the place to isolation and insecurity. \\"Divine or celestial, the city reflects with the space of European culture a religious ideal of 'collective life', on which converge all the major issues of future society. The eater of men and the producer of social regulations, of power conflicts and culture shocks.\\"Bruno Dumons et Bernard Hours, Ville et religion en Europe du XVIe au XXe siècle - La cité réenchantée, la pierre et l'écrit, 2010, p.10). \\"Divine ou céleste, la cité renvoie dans l’espace culturel européen à l’image d’un idéal religieux du « vivre ensemble » où convergent tous les enjeux majeurs de la société future. Mangeuse d’hommes et productrice de nouvelles économies, la ville s’apparente à un espace où s’opèrent toutes sortes de mobilités démographiques, de régulations sociales, de conflits de pouvoir et de chocs culturels\\" The history of cities is the history of religions cross and interlocking, and of the Christian experience of this relationship, principally in relation to the urban conquest through which religion expanded itself. Since the 1960s, thinkers have raised the question of the \\"Secular City\\",Harvey Cox, La Cité séculière. Essai théologique sur la sécularisation et l’urbanisation, Paris, Casterman, 1968Joseph Comblin, Théologie de la ville, Paris, Éditions Universitaires, 1968Jacques Ellul, Sans feu, ni lieu, Paris, Gallimard, 1975 and the city has become a \\"theological issue\\".Bruno Dumons et Bernard Hours, Ville et religion en Europe du XVIe au XXe siècle - La cité réenchantée, la pierre et l'écrit, 2010, p.11) In any case, the urban project, which diverts man from God, will at the last be judged severely. The city is also the location of spiritual conflict. It therefore bears a profound meaning, a spiritual mark, which is the sign of malediction, and the founder of the city is cursed among all. \\"It is through slavery that Israel is linked to the city.\\" All the cities, within the Bible, are cursed, and \\"never a word of hope, never a word of pardon for the city, for it is a terrible manifestation of the brilliant morning star, which has debased humanity.\\" This malediction explains all the difficulties, all the problems encountered in cities, and however much one may seek solutions (security, urbanism, isolation), man will never make the city anything but that which it is. Here, one can detect the influence of Ellul's good friend Bernard Charbonneau. \\"Ellul was constantly recognizing his debt to Charbonneau\\", said pastor and theologian Jean- Sébastien Ingrand, director of the Strausbourg Protestant Media Library. Together they published \\"Outline of a personalist manifesto\\", in which they denounced, among other things, the city as contrary to liberty.Jacques Ellul et Bernard Charbonneau, Directives pour un manifeste personnaliste, 1935, texte dactylographié édité par les groupes d'Esprit de la région du Sud-ouest; publié en 2003 par les Cahiers Jacques-Ellul n°1, \\"Les années personnalistes\\", p. 68 \\"The man of the city is rich in money but poor in space and time\\", they wrote. \\"The city is a place of inhumanity, especially the banlieue, a banal and homogeneous space, the exact opposite of the country. The city is a place of artifice, where nature is vanquished. But note: one must not romanticize nature, which is perfectly capable of defending itself alone. It is man who is fragile, and above all his liberty. Bernard Charbonneau with Le jardin de Babylone (1969) and Jacques Ellul with Jacques Ellul, Sans feu, ni lieu (1975), rediscovered this point.Roger Cans, compte-rendu d’un colloque sur Bernard Charbonneau, précurseur de l’écologie, organisé du 2 au 4 mai 2011 à l’IRSAM (université de Pau). \\"L’homme des villes est riche d’argent, mais pauvre d’espace et de temps », écrivent-ils. « La ville est un lieu d’inhumanité, la banlieue surtout, espace banalisé et uniforme, l’exact opposé de la campagne. La ville est un lieu d’artifice, où la nature est vaincue. Mais attention : il ne faut pas idéologiser la nature, qui se défend très bien toute seule. C’est l’homme qui est fragile, et surtout sa liberté. Bernard Charbonneau avec Le jardin de Babylone (1969) et Jacques Ellul avec Jacques Ellul, Sans feu, ni lieu (1975), se retrouvent sur ce point\\" The city has grown to the size foretold by Ellul and Charbonneau, who were witnessing the urbanization of the world, the universalization of technique, and the standardization of all civilizations.Jean-Luc Porquet, « Nous tous pareils » in Jacques Ellul - L'homme qui avait (presque) tout prévu, Le Cherche-Midi, 2003, p. 151-158 Indeed, in 2008, the world's urban population surpassed its rural population. Where Charbonneau applied the symbol of Babylon, Ellul focuses on Ninevah. The big city is a mass which cannot survive without sacrificing liberty. \\"This, then, is what separates the two men: against the catastrophism of Charbonneau, Ellul presents a Christian hope, which leads from the Garden of Eden to the New Jerusalem foretold in Revelations.\\". == Contents == ; I.

He took an apprentice of his own as early as 1529–30,Clothworkers' Company Records, Wardens' Account Books CL/D/5/1 ('1520'-1558), (Account of Richard Rogers rendered 24 June 1530). and was Junior Warden in the Mastership of John Permeter, 1531–32.Clothworkers' Company Records, Wardens' Account Books CL/D/5/1 ('1520'-1558), (Receyttes of the halle rendered by Richard fferyce). He served thereafter with the Company's Court of Assistants, sometimes auditing the accounts and performing other responsible duties. He obtained a substantial Company loan for his brother (also a citizen Clothworker, who assisted in his business) in February 1537/8, binding himself as security.Clothworkers' Company Records, Court Orders A (1537–1558), ref CL/B/1/1. He appears in litigation with the Merchant Taylor John Yorke.The National Archives, Discovery catalogue, piece description C1/931/44, Yorke v. Huett. == The Master and his wife == Brass (1539) to Nicholas Leveson (d. 1539) and wife Dionysia (d. 1560): St Andrew Undershaft. The senior Clothworker Edward Altham had served as Sheriff, but not as alderman of the City, in 1531–32.W.J. Thoms, A Survey of London written in the year 1598, by John Stow (Chatto & Windus, London 1876), p. 194. The status of the Company advanced early in 1538 when John Tolous, First Warden in 1536–37, was elected Alderman for Tower ward.A.B. Beavan, The Aldermen of the City of London Temp. Henry III to 1912 (Corporation of the City of London, 1913), II, p. 30. It appears that, being required to transfer to a more senior Company, he refused, and was briefly imprisoned in the Newgate. The Clothworkers then promised faithfully to do their bounden duty for the honour and common wealth of the city, and the Court therefore acknowledged them to be among the twelve head Companies of London (from which progress to the Court of Aldermen, and thereby to the shrievalty and mayoralty, should normally ariseHerbert, History of the Twelve Great Livery Companies, I, 'Historical essay', pp. 1–224.): Tolous was not required to transfer, and became alderman.J.J. Baddeley, The Aldermen of Cripplegate Ward, from 1276 to 1900 (Private, London 1900), p. 145, citing City Records, Letter Book P, folio 139. The Company showed their appreciation by making Tolous their Master in August 1538. Hewett, who became First Warden in the succeeding Mastership of Thomas Spenser, 1539–40, faced altered career expectations as in August 1543 he was elected Master of the Company;Clothworkers' Company Records, Court Orders A (1537–1558), ref CL/B/1/1, s.a. 1538–1543. in the same year Tolous was chosen one of the Sheriffs.Beavan, Aldermen of London, I, p. 30. Sir William Bowyer, who died in office as Lord Mayor in 1544, mentioned both Tolous and Hewett among his loving friends, and gave forty shillings to the \\"Honnest Company of Shooters\\" to be spent by Hewett at a supper at Mile End.Will of Sir William Bowyer, Lord Mayor of London (P.C.C. 1544). As the Master's chair approached, Hewett married Alice, daughter of Nicholas Leveson, Mercer and Merchant of the Staple of Calais (who died in 1539).Will of Nicholas Leveson, Merchant of London (P.C.C. 1539, written 1536). Waters, Chester of Chicheley, p. 227. Nicholas and his brother James Leveson (died 1547),Will of James Leveson (P.C.C. 1547). of Wolverhampton origins, were very prominent merchant citizens and Mercers in London during the 1520s and 1530s, and Nicholas had been Sheriff of London in 1534–35.R.F. Wisker, 'The estates of James Leveson of Wolverhampton (d. 1547)', Staffordshire Archaeological & Historical Society Transactions XXXVII (1995–1996), pp. 119–138. Leveson's wife Dionysia (Bodley) had brought him numerous sons and daughters, of whom Alice was the third, unmarried at the time of her father's death. James Leveson had married Margery, full sister of Thomas Offley, around 1530.G.C. Bower and H.W.F.

(Hathi Trust.) The wealth and reputation of the Leveson mercantile operation, linked to their Kentish estates around the River Medway, continued in Dionysia, her descendants and near kindred. William and Alice Hewett had several children, of whom only one, Anne, born in 1543, reached maturity, despite having been dropped by accident into the River Thames from a house on (or near) London Bridge at an early age.John Strype, A Survey of the Cities of London and Westminster (London 1720), V.vi, pp. 134–35 (HRI Online/University of Sheffield). Waters, Chester of Chicheley, pp. 225–26. The hero of this story (first published from family tradition by John Strype in 1720), who dived in and rescued her, was Hewett's apprentice Edward Osborne (c.1530–1592), whose service to him began in 1544 or 1545, becoming free in 1553. Hewett therefore laid the foundations of Osborne's future success.S.P. Anderson, 'Osborne, Sir Edward (c.1530–1592), merchant and local politician', Oxford Dictionary of National Biography. == Alderman and Sheriff of London == Augustine Hynde, slightly junior to Hewett, became Master of the Company in August 1545 and was chosen alderman in April 1546.Beavan, Aldermen of London, I, p. 32. Beavan's exasperation with the mistakes of Charles Welch is apparent in his footnotes to pages 31–35. Tolous, who should have been the first Clothworker Lord Mayor, died in 1548, as the Company Hall and Parlour at Mincing Lane were rebuilding. If Hewett was reluctant to accept civic office, Edward's accession might have encouraged him: but when, after a year as Auditor to the City, he was elected for the Vintry ward in September 1550,Beavan, Aldermen of London, II (1913), Vintry ward: pp. 205–15, citing City records Rep. 12 (ii), ff. 261, 269; Letter Book R, fo. 90b. (British History online). he at first refused to serve and was committed to the Newgate until he accepted.City Records, Rep. 12(ii), fo. 261. This sat uncomfortably with the Company's former promise of duty, to which it owed its position among the Twelve. Hynde, a busy alderman, was by then (with Richard Turke and William Blackwell) an efficient Trustee for the City in the matter of the chantry lands and estates,See 'Grant of the Rents and Annual Payments for Superstitious Uses' (1550), in Charters and Letters Patent to The Clothworkers' Company, pp. 75–78. and became Sheriff at Michaelmas 1550. William Hewett was among the Merchant Adventurers and Merchants of the Staple summoned by the Duke of Northumberland to sign the Letters Patent for the Limitation of the Crown, as the succession to King Edward was planned.'Letters Patent for the Limitation of the Crowne' from the transcript of Ralph Starkey in MS Harl. 35, fol. 364: J.G.

The King died on 6 July and Queen Jane was proclaimed on the 10th. The distinguished former Mayor Sir Ralph Warren, alderman for Candlewick ward, died on the following day, and was buried on the 16th.J.G. Nichols (ed.), The Diary of Henry Machyn, Citizen and Merchant- Taylor of London, Camden Society (London 1848), Original Series Vol. XLII, p. 36.

(Beavan states 1553: Furdell, O.D.N.B., states 1554, but Sir Ralph Warren's Will (P.C.C. 1553) was proved in August 1553.) On the following day Queen Mary was proclaimed.

On 23 July Thomas Offley was named by the Mayor Sir George Barne to serve as Sheriff for the coming year, and on 1 August Thomas Lodge (then in Flanders), not yet an alderman, was chosen by the Commons to serve with him. On 3 August the Mayor and aldermen welcomed Queen Mary to London at Smithfield Bars and presented to her the sceptre.Wriothesley, Chronicle of England, II, pp. 90–94. Page from the prayerbook of Lady Jane Grey (Harley MS 2342) After a riot at Paul's Cross on 13 August, Mayor and aldermen were threatened by the Queen's Council with loss of the City's liberties.Wriothesley, Chronicle of England, II, pp. 97–99. There followed the arraignment and execution of Northumberland and the appointment of new officers. Lodge was elected alderman of Cheap ward, vacant by the death of Stephen Kirton,Diary of Henry Machyn, p. 42. on 23 August,Beavan, Aldermen of London, II, pp. 99–106, citing Rep. 13(i), ff. 74, 88b. but remained unsworn at Michaelmas Eve (28 September), when the sheriffs customarily took up their term of office and the new Mayor was elected. William Hewett was therefore installed to take his place as Sheriff with Offley. Queen Mary's progress to her Coronation occurred on 30 September and 1 October 1553.Chronicle of Queen Jane, pp. 27–31. Lodge was sworn alderman on 24 October: Thomas White took his oath as Mayor in succession to Sir George Barne on 28 October, and on 10 December was presented to the Queen and knighted by the Earl of Arundel.Wriothesley, Chronicle of England, II, p. 105.

On 13 November Thomas Cranmer, Guildford Dudley and Lady Jane Grey, Ambrose and Henry Dudley, were arraigned for High Treason at the Guildhall and condemned to die. When news of Wyatt's rising in Kent reached the Mayor on 25 January, Sir Thomas White and the sheriffs secretly arrested the Marquess of Northampton that night in Sir Edward Warner's house, and Warner was kept in Hewett's lodgings until he could be delivered to the Tower. On 1 February Mary announced the rebellion in the Guildhall, and next day the aldermen together raised a muster of a thousand men, each in their own wards, for the defence of the City. The assault on London followed, and the defeated rebels were condemned on 10 February.Wriothesley, Chronicle of England, II, pp. 107–11. On 12 February 1554 Guildford Dudley was delivered to Offley by the Lieutenant of the Tower to be led to his execution. It is said that Jane was committed to William Hewett: but according to John Stow, she was led to the scaffold by the Lieutenant himself.J. Stow, The Annales of England, Faithfully Collected out of the most Autenticall Authors (Ralfe Newbery, London 1600), p. 1052.

The Sheriffs' christian names are transposed. Over the months which followed, Hewett and Offley were locked unalterably into their official role in Mary's sanguinary retribution.Chronicle of Queen Jane, pp. 27–83. == Approach to the Mayoralty == Augustine Hynde died in August 1554 leaving the Clothworkers still without a prospective Mayor, but in 1555–56, at the height of the persecutions, John Machell transferred to Bassishaw and served as Sheriff (with Sir Thomas Leigh).Beavan, Aldermen of London, I, p. 34. During 1556 three other Clothworkers, James Altham (son of Edward Altham the Sheriff), John Hawes (or Halse) (Master, 1546–47) and Richard Foulkes (Master, 1550–51) were advanced to the aldermanry.Beavan, Aldermen of London, I, p. 35. After Foulkes was sworn to Vintry ward on 19 January, 1556/7, in February Hewett appealed earnestly to be discharged from 'his cloke and room',City Records, Rep. 13(ii), fol. 478 b. but in June he was persuaded by a small committee appointed by the Court of Aldermen to alter his decision.City Records, Rep. 13(ii), fo. 512 b.C. Welch, 'Hewett, William', D.N.B. James Altham served as Sheriff in 1557–58, and soon afterwards lost his wife in childbirth.Diary of Henry Machyn, p. 173. It was said by Henry Machyn, that John Machell should have been Lord Mayor in the appointment for 1558–59, but he died in August 1558Diary of Henry Machyn, p. 170-71. and it was Sir Thomas Leigh who as Mayor attended the Coronation of Queen Elizabeth, one of his Sheriffs being John Hawes. Hewett's very considerable wealth certainly qualified him for civic office. From his mansion in Philipot Lane and his premises at the Sign of Three Cranes in Candlewick Street (in St Martin Orgar) he associated various members of his family in business. Henry Bosvile, younger brother of Godfrey (manorial lord of Gunthwaite and Oxspring), became Hewett's servant and assisted at his purchase of a Lincolnshire manor at Beesby (?or Beelsby)See Loseley Manuscripts, LM 1083/4 (Surrey History Centre). in the soke of Waltham with lands at Brigsley, North Thoresby, Wold Newton and North Coates (near Grimsby) in May 1554.Calendar of Patent Rolls, Philip & Mary I: 1553–1554, p. 371: see Chancery, C 1/1435/36. Yorkshire remained important: he enjoyed the patronage and friendship of the Earls of Shrewsbury, who as Lords of Hallamshire at their principal seat of Sheffield Castle commanded his natural loyalty.Waters,Chester of Chicheley. Thomas Hewett, his brother, had purchased the manor of Shireoaks (near Worksop) in 1546, where Shireoaks Hall was built by his descendants.N. Pevsner, The Buildings of England, 2nd edn. revised by E.

George Talbot (the 6th Earl) became a member of the Clothworkers' Company:Welch, D.N.B., citing City Records, Rep. 15, fo. 66. in October 1557 Hewett had to defer recovery of a £2000 debt from William Lord Dacre of Gilsland and his son (George's uncle and cousin) while they were absent with Francis, the 5th Earl preparing against a Scottish invasion.A. Davidson, 'Dacre, Leonard (by 1533–73), of Naworth, Cumb. and West Harlsey, Yorks.', in S.T.

In 1560 Hewett and Sir John Lyon joined the 5th Earl in a bond of 10,000 marks towards the jointure of Elizabeth Blount, widow of Sir Thomas Pope, whom the Earl hoped to marry.The National Archives Discovery Catalogue, item description for the Talbot Papers (Lambeth Palace Archives), Folio 91. In autumn 1559 Hewett was party to a fine levied for the sale of Wales Wood Hall, 12 messuages, 6 cottages and lands in the Yorkshire lordship of Wales.F. Collins, 'Fines: Michaelmas Term 1 & 2 Elizabeth (1559)', Feet of Fines of the Tudor Period [Yorks]: Part 1, 1486–1571 (Yorkshire Archaeological Society, Leeds 1887), pp. 223–31 (British History online. Retrieved 24 May 2017). == Mayoralty, 1559–1560 == Hewett finally became Lord Mayor in October 1559, the first such appointment of Elizabeth I's reign and the first Clothworker to be Lord Mayor. The Sheriffs were Thomas Lodge and Roger Martyn. On 8 November he was sent a letter from the Privy Council requiring that he 'might cause speedy reformation of divers enormities in the same city', particularly with reference to laws controlling consumption, the wearing of extravagant clothing, the serving of meat in hostelries on fast-days, and the over-pricing of goods. He was to remedy the shortage of victuals and fuel, to seek out houses of illegal dicing and other 'plays and games', and to make weekly progress reports.G.D. Ramsay, The City of London in International Politics at the Accession of Elizabeth Tudor (Manchester University Press 1975), p. 57 and note 139, citing British Library Sloane MS 1,710, fol. 158(−60). A declaration on the price of poultry followed in April.Diary of Henry Machyn, p. 230. The Mayor was soon called to preside at the Guildhall trials for High Treason upon the senior officers at the surrender of Calais in December 1557 – January 1558. The Indictments against Thomas Lord Wentworth, Sir Ralph Chamberlain, Edward Grymston, John Harleston and Nicholas Alysaunder had been prepared in July 1558.Fourth Report of the Deputy Keeper of the Records (By Command, William Clowes, London 1843), Appendix II: Inventory and Calendar of the Baga de Secretis, Part 2, Pouch XXXVIII (M. 7), pp. 259–60. They were accused of having conspired with the French King to surrender Ruysbank, Newenham Bridge and Calais to him deliberately, preparing no defence against the pre-arranged approach of the Duke of Guise (who merely made a pretence of siege), and intentionally admitting a French force by the Bulleyn gate. In April 1559 Wentworth was found Not Guilty. William Hewett presided at the trial of Edward Grymston, Comptrollor of Calais, between 28 November and 1 December 1559 (who was found Not Guilty and discharged), and then at the arraignment of Sir Ralph Chamberlain, Lieutenant of the Castle of Calais, and John Harleston, Lieutenant of the Castle of Ruysbank, between 19 and 22 December: they were found Guilty and sentenced to die at Tyburn.Inventory and Calendar of Baga de Secretis, Part 2, Pouch XXXIX, Bundles 1 and 2, pp. 261–62. However on 8 June 1560 Sir Ralph received a royal pardon and restitution of his goods.M.A. Everett Green (ed.), Calendar of State Papers, Domestic Series, of the Reign of Elizabeth, 1601–03; with Addenda, 1547–65 (Longman & Co., (etc.), London 1870), pp. 502–03. This reference is mistakenly transposed by Welch (D.N.B.). Hewett made the river-journey to court to receive his knighthood on 21 January 1560.Diary of Henry Machyn, p. 224. He was appointed President of St Thomas' Hospital, Southwark, and maintained that position, and his alderman's cloak, for the rest of his life. Richard Foulkes, being nominated Sheriff in August 1560, was able to withdraw by payment of a fine of £200: the distinguished Clothworker Rowland Hayward, Master of the Company 1559–60, was advanced to the aldermanry in his place, later serving twice as Lord Mayor. The succession thus secured, and honour so satisfied, James Altham was also discharged from the aldermanry at the end of July 1561.Beavan, Aldermen of London, II, Aldersgate ward: pp. 1–8, citing Rep. 14, fo. 516b. Elizabeth's important reforms to her coinage, which included much debased currency, provided perhaps the last duties of Hewett's mayoralty. The Queen wrote to him on 4 October 1560 instructing him to strike marks upon the debased Edwardian silver testoons (shillings and part-shillings) still in currency, devaluing those marked with a portcullis to fourpence-halfpenny, with a greyhound to twopence- farthing, and those unmarked to no value.John Stow, The Chronicles of England from Brute unto this Present Year of 1580 (Henry Bynneman for Ralph Newbury, Cum Privilegio, London 1580), p. 1115 (Umich/eebo). At the same time she issued instructions to her various Treasurers to send all unserviceable plate to the mint for rendering into coin. Hewett was thus concerned in these affairs with Sir William Cecil, Sir Edmund Peckham (High Treasurer of the Mint), Sir John Yorke, Sir Thomas Parry, the Worshipful Company of Goldsmiths, and also the Marquess of Winchester and Sir Richard Sackville, Commissioners for the Coinage, whom Her Majesty suspected of deceiving her.R. Lemon, Calendar of State Papers, Domestic Series, of the Reigns of Edward VI, Mary, Elizabeth 1547–1580 (Longman, Brown, Green, Longmans & Roberts, London 1857), pp. 160–61. (Hathi Trust). This reference is mistakenly transposed by Welch (D.N.B.). Thomas Lodge was also occupied with the reforms, and brought workers from Germany to assist in the refining, many of whom suffered from arsenic poisoning as a result.Arthure Agarde, 'Of Sterling Money' in Thomas Hearne (Ed.), A Collection of Curious Discourses written by Eminent Antiquaries, Vol. II (New Edition)(Benjamin White, London 1775), No. XLIII, pp. 316–17. In August 1562 Hewett served on an imposing Bench of justices at the Guildhall arraignment of several counterfeiters, four of whom were condemned to death.Diary of Henry Machyn, p. 290. == Elizabethan alderman == Sir William's mother-in-law Dionysia Leveson died late in 1560, leaving her extensive estates at Halling and elsewhere in KentHer estates at West Court manor in Gillingham, Chatham and Horsenden in Kent formed the subject of a common recovery between Dionysia Leveson and William Hewett in 1554; see The National Archives, Common Pleas ref.

Palmer's Anglo-American Legal Tradition website (University of Houston/O'Quinn Law Library). to her sons and making Sir William Hewett and John Southcott two of her executors. As matriarch of the continuing Leveson enterprise she represented a most powerful arm of Hewett's influence, was godmother to Anne Hewett, and referred to William's brother Thomas as her \\"gossepp\\" or spiritual kin.Will of Dionysia Leveson (P.C.C. 1560): see at Nina Green's Oxford Authorship website. Her will also refers to Edward Osborne, whose career during Mary's reign is somewhat obscure,Anderson, 'Osborne, Sir Edward', O.D.N.B. but remained associated with Hewett's household. Anne Hewett, then aged 17, was still unmarried, and should become heir to her father's fortune. Over the next two years she received the attention of various prospective suitors including George Talbot, who on his father's death late in 1560 became 6th Earl of Shrewsbury. However by 1562 she was married to Edward Osborne, Hewett having remarked famously \\"Osborn saved her, and Osborn should enjoy her\\", according to the story received by Strype.Strype, Survey of London and Westminster, V.vi, p. 134. This tale was handed down in the family of the Dukes of Leeds, their descendants, and in later centuries was commemorated by an engraving after Samuel Wale(R. Thompson), Chronicles of London Bridge: by an Antiquary (Smith, Elder and Co., London 1827), pp. 313–15, citing W. Guthrie, Complete History of the Peerage of England (London 1742), I, p. 246. and a mural at the Clothworkers' Hall, since destroyed. The marriage possibly followed upon the death of her mother Dame Alice, which occurred in April 1561. That was the occasion for a mighty funeral procession, led by 24 poor women and 12 poor men in new gowns; then 40 mourners in black, eight aldermen before the Mayor (Sir William Chester) (Hewett's successor) and the others after him; 20 clerks singing; a pennon of arms, followed by the Heralds, Rouge Croix Pursuivant and Clarenceux King of Arms, and the corpse with 4 pennons of arms and a black velvet pall worked with arms; the chief mourners; 40 women mourners; the Clothworkers in the livery, and 200 others following in the way to St Martin Orgar church, which was hung with black cloth and arms. After the sermon a dinner was held at the house, also hung with black and arms.Diary of Henry Machyn, p. 256. The monument raised for her was destroyed in the Great Fire of London, together with most of the church. Sir William remained clubbable, and of good appetite. At the Grocers' Company feast in June 1561 he was a guest in the company of the Lord Mayor (Sir William Chester), Sir Roger Cholmeley, Sir Martin Bowes, Sir William Garrard, Thomas Lodge and others, entertained with clerks singing and viols playing. A month later he stood deputy for the Earl of Shrewsbury as godfather at the christening of the son of Garter King of Arms Sir Gilbert Dethick. Again at the Merchant Taylors' feast in July 1562, with the Mayor William Harper, Sir Thomas White, Sir Thomas Offley and Sir Martin Bowes, he represented a spirit of unity between guests including the Earl of Sussex, the Earl of Kildare, several of the aldermen, and Dethick and Harvey, Garter and Clarenceux.Diary of Henry Machyn, pp. 260, 264, 287. Sir Roger Cholmeley purchased a house at Highgate in 1536, becoming its first eminent resident.A.P. Baggs, D.K. Bolton, M.A. Hicks and R.B. Pugh, 'Hornsey, including Highgate: Highgate', in T.F.T.

He built the public and free Grammar School there, on the site of the dissolved hermitage, (according to Strype) in 1562, its chapel being rebuilt by Bishop Sandys.Strype, Survey of London and Westminster (London 1720), Appendix 1, Chapter 14 (Circuit walk: Highgate), pp. 134–35. This received Charters by Letters Patent in January and April 1565, incorporating six Governors of whom William Hewett and Roger Martyn, aldermen, stand first in the list.Calendar of Patent Rolls, Elizabeth I, Vol. III: 1563–1566, pp. 207–08, no. 1053, pp. 280–81, no. 1403. Cholmeley died in 1565. In the last two years of Hewett's life the Clothworkers' Company, of which he had become the senior figure, plunged into parliamentary action. Clothworkers were suffering from a loss of exports, since the Merchant Adventurers (who received their new Charter from Elizabeth in 1564Calendar of Patent Rolls, Elizabeth I, Vol. III: 1563–1566 (HMSO London 1960) pp. 178–80, item 922. The last-named member of the Fellowship, 'William Hewitte', is probably not the alderman.) increasingly exported unfinished cloth for finishing in Antwerp, cutting out their trade. The Company appealed to the Privy Council in June 1565 seeking to establish a fixed proportion of finished cloth exports and to obtain rights of search to ensure such regulations were obeyed. Their claim to produce cloth of equal standard however proved inconclusive, and in October 1566 they introduced a bill in Parliament to compel merchants to export at least one finished cloth for every four unfinished. After a confrontation with the Merchant Adventurers a revised bill, reducing the proportion to one in ten, was introduced in December and was passed by both Houses, but with inadequate rights of search the Company gained little benefit from it.G.R. Elton, The Parliament of England, 1559–1581 (Cambridge University Press, 1989), pp. 82–84. == Death and legacy == The Minute-book of Highgate School supplies Hewett's date of death on 25 January 1566/7.D. Hewett, William Hewett, 1496–1566/7, Lord Mayor of London, p. 10 & Plate p. 15.

Hewett, William Hewett, 1496–1566/7, Lord Mayor of London, pp. 14–24. It reveals his extensive engagement with his Hewett and Leveson kin. His principal beneficiaries were Edward Osborne and Anne, and Henry Hewett son of his brother Thomas, all four of whom were his executors. Henry inherited the Three Cranes, with remainder to Thomas and then to Edward. Thomas, a wealthy man in his own right, received a tenement in St Clement's Lane. The Crown in Fenchurch Street (St Dionis Backchurch) devolved to Anne his heir, as did his lands in Wales and manor of Harthill in Yorkshire (excepting a farm to his cousin John Rodes) while the neighbouring farm of Woodsetts was given to Osborne. These became the ancestral heart of the Kiveton Park estates of the Dukes of Leeds. Another important beneficiary was William Hewett, his godson, brother to his said nephew Henry, who received the parsonage of Dunton Bassett in Leicestershire and an estate at Mansfield in Sherwood, Nottinghamshire, as well as £5 annually towards his education at Gray's Inn. This, presumably, was the William Hewett admitted to Gray's Inn on 4 March 1565/6.Admission Register 1521–1887, fol. 555: J. Foster, The Register of Admissions to Gray's Inn, 1521–1889 (Hansard, London 1889), p. 35. Other children of Thomas Hewett, his brothers-in-law Thomas Leveson and Edmund Calthorpe and their children, were among many receiving bequests: several of the nephews and nieces were William's godchildren, and Dyonise Hewett and Dyonise Calthorpe were living with him at Candlewick Street. Among his public benefactions were bequests to the Clothworkers (a dinner, and to poor men of the livery), the church and parson of St Martin Orgar, the poor inhabitants of Candlewick, to maidens' marriages and the poor of Wales and Harthill, the poor of St Thomas' Hospital, the poor prisoners of Newgate and Ludgate. He gave two foder of Peak lead towards a new water supply for the city.

Portrait  The fine portrait of Sir William Hewett was described in the collection of the Dukes of Leeds during the 18th century.T. Pennant, Some Account of London, 3rd Edition (John Archer, Dublin 1791), p. 322. After the effects of the last Duke were sold it came into the hands of a Munich art dealer and was bought in 1966 by the Trustees of the Georg Schäfer Collection in Schweinfurt, as a possible work of Ludger Tom Ring the Younger. This attribution being doubted, and the Trustees deciding to focus upon other interests, it was generously released from the Collection and loaned by its owner to the Museum of London. The attribution has transferred to Anthonis Mor, although a Schweinfurt expert considered it to be by an English artist.D.

The settlement is located on Highway 6, northwest of Fergus. Once a thriving rural community, little remains of the original settlement. ==History== The Fergus stage coach, which carried both mail and passengers, stopped in front of the general store and post office in Cumnock (circa 1890) James Samson, a Scottish immigrant, purchased of land in the area in 1852. Samson built a general store and tavern along the Owen Sound Road (now Highway 6), and named the settlement after his hometown of Cumnock, Scotland. A post office was established in Samson's store in 1855, with Samson as postmaster. In 1855, Richard Gluyas laid out Gluyasville a short distance north of Cumnock. Gluyasville was eventually absorbed by Cumnock. The Wellington, Grey and Bruce Railway built a line through Cumnock in 1871, and a station was built there. That same year, Cumnock was noted as having a saw mill, a wagon maker, and two hotels (the British Hotel and the Red Lion). The Red Lion Hotel was owned by Scottish immigrant John Muir, who \\"went back to Scotland several times to bring back wives to Cumnock\\". The Cumnock Methodist Church was built in 1877. Cumnock was noted as having a cheese factory in 1880. Decline At its peak, Cumnock had a population of 200, though by 1908, the settlement had one hotel, two stores, two churches, and a population of 86. The post office closed in 1915, and the Methodist church closed in 1924. An author writing in 1933 described the northern boundary of Nichol Township \\"where Cumnock used to be\\", and by 1969, Cumnock was no longer listed on provincial maps. The railroad line through Cumnock was eventually taken over by Canadian National Railway, and was abandoned in 1983. ==Cumnock Tract== In 1964, the County of Wellington purchased two parcels of forested land at Cumnock for recreational use.

His full name, father's praenomen (Publius) and tribe (Stellatina) are known from these inscriptions. It is often assumed that Agricola was the son or grandson of the equestrian officer Glitius Barbarus, who is attested as living in 48 or 49, but Olli Salomies notes that his father's praenomen is attested as Publius, then argues that it makes better sense to assume that his name at birth was Atilius Agricola and he was afterwards adopted by a Q. Glitius.Salomies, Adoptive and polyonymous nomenclature in the Roman Empire, (Helsinski: Societas Scientiarum Fenica, 1992), p. 96 == Career == Of these inscriptions found in Taurinorum, two provide the details of his cursus honorum up to his first consulship., His first documented service was as sevir equitum Romanorum at the annual review of the equites, which was followed as one of the decemviri stlitibus judicandus, one of the magistracies that comprised the vigintiviri. Agricola then served as military tribune in Legio I Italica. Under the emperor Vespasian he was quaestor, which could have been as late as the year 78. Since Roman senators commonly held the office of quaestor at the age of 25, this suggests Agricola was born in the year 53, at the latest. Following this he was curule aedile, then praetor, an office commonly held at the age of 30. Both inscriptions include a term as governor of Hispania Citerior, although Werner Eck does not mention this office in his fasti of governors for this period. Then Agricola received a commission and was commander, or legatus of Legio VI Ferrata. During the reign of the emperor Nerva he was governor of the imperial province of Gallia Belgica from 94 to 97; Agricola may have been picked by Nerva for the office.Werner Eck, \\"Jahres- und Provinzialfasten der senatorischen Statthalter von 69/70 bis 138/139\\", Chiron, 12 (1982), pp. 322-327 After holding the fasces for the first time he was governor of Pannonia from 100, when he replaced Lucius Julius Ursus Servianus, to the end of 102.Eck, \\"Jahres- und Provinzialfasten\\", pp. 334-338 Between the end of his service in Pannonia and returning to Rome, Agricola participated in the Dacian Wars, where he earned a set of dona militaria, or military decorations, appropriate to an ex-consul.; see also Valerie A. Maxfield, \\"The Dona Militaria of the Roman Army\\" (Durham theses: Durham University, 1972), p. 24 (Last accessed 11 August 2017) Following his second consulship, Agricola was urban prefect of Rome. He was also recorded as a member of at least two priestly collegia, first as one of the septemviri epulonum, then afterwards he was admitted to the sodales Augustales. == References == Category:1st-century Romans Category:2nd-century Romans Category:Suffect consuls of Imperial Rome Category:Roman governors of Gallia Belgica Category:Roman governors of Pannonia Category:Epulones of the Roman Empire Category:Atilii ","title":"Quintus Glitius Atilius Agricola"},{"id":"54111343","text":"Keith Alan Bell (third ¼ 1953) is an English former professional rugby league footballer who played in the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s, and coached.

It is one of the most representative buildings of the most important state institution for postal traffic and services. It was constructed in the period from 1935 to 1938 as the palace of the Post Office Savings Bank, the Main Post Office and the Main Telegraph. Since the completion of the work to date, the part of the palace from Takovska Street designed for the work of the Main Post Office has not changed its basic purpose. On the other hand, the part of the palace from King Alexander Boulevard in which the Post Office Savings Bank was located, from 1946 to September 2006, was used to house the National Bank until its relocation to a new facility on Slavija Square. Since 2003, some ministries of the Republic of Serbia were located in this building, and since 2013, it is used by the Constitutional Court of Serbia. The same year, in 2013, the Palace of the Main Post Office was declared a cultural monument. == History of construction == The Main Post office, whose history of service dates back to the forties of the nineteenth century, was the highest postal institution not only in Serbia but in the whole of the Кingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, later the Кingdom of Yugoslavia. On the other hand, the Post Office Savings Bank began operations on 1 October 1923 at the Palace “Мoskvа“ in Теrazije . Although a young institution, the Post Office Savings Bank became one of the \\"most popular financial institutions\\" in the whole country after a few years of operation, so the rooms of the Palace “Moscow“ became too small for her work. The authorities solved the question of inadequate accommodation of both institutions with the construction of a single building of the Main Post Office and the Post Office Savings Bank. Despite all the activities related to the construction of buildings intended for postal services, the building of the Main Post Office was not constructed until the beginning of the fourth decade of the twentieth century. An all-Yugoslav competition for the project of the Palace of the Post Office Savings Bank and the Main Post Office and Telegraph was announced in Belgrade in 1930. From a total of fifteen of submitted works, whose authors were architects from all over the country, as well as those who were in training or working abroad, in September 1930, three papers and four purchases were selected and awarded. First prize was awarded to the joint project of Zagreb architects Јosip Pičman and Аndrija Baranji, designed according to the principles of modern architecture, while the second prize was awarded to the also modern project of Slovenian architect Аco Lovrenčić. However, the realization of the winning project was soon abandoned. The beginning of the thirties of the last century was marked by the economic crisis in the European context, while the second reason lay in the discontent of the highest state authorities by the selected project of architect Pičman, which in their opinion did not satisfy the requirements for representative and monumental architecture of public buildings. The reduction and ease of the facade canvas of Pičman’s project did not fit the dominant architectural concept, which included the architecture of public buildings expressing the power, prosperity and statehood of the young Yugoslav Kingdom through its gorgeous, academically shaped facades. Immediately after the competition, at the end of 1930, it was decided that the Ministry of Construction amend the winning project. Elaboration of the sketches was entrusted to the architect Dimitrije M. Leko, and within the ministry, a narrower internal competition was organized to create new plans for the façades of the building, where the project of the architect Vasilije Androsov was evaluated as the best one. However, after the adoption of the new project of architect Androsov, the construction of the building did not start until another almost five years. Having approved the construction in 1934, on 17 August 1935, the ceremony of consecration of the foundation stone took place. The work on the realization of this very important facility for the then Belgrade environment lasted three years and ended on 10 October 1938. == Architecture == Architecture of the Palace of the Post Office Savings Bank, Main Post Office and Main Telegraph in Belgrade reflects the complexity of the social, political, stylistic and aesthetic circumstances that ruled the entire artistic creativity of the interwar period. It is based on a combination of modernist and functional base and representatively molded facades in the academic style. New Androsov’s project largely relied on the initial competition solution, which is primarily reflected in the decision of the base and disposition of space. Relations of mass, the position of the building in relation to the street, contours of the asymmetrically resolved basis, as well as the city and entrance number were retained from the original project to detail. All facades of the freestanding palace were recomposed according to the principles of academic monumental architecture, typical of the architecture of Belgrade of the fourth decade, while instead of the rather simple facades with combined glass and concrete, the author predicted cladding with granite slabs and artificial stone. The highlighted avant-corps of the main facade, except that it shares the façade canvas into two unequal, asymmetrical parts, also reflects the internal functional division of the object. The avant-corps is treated as a façade and outlined by the main portal in the ground-floor, elongated by Doric columns in the zone from the second to the fifth floor and a characteristic tower with a clock in the highest zone. Adjusting the modern concept of building to visually expressing the strength and prosperity of the new Yugoslav state and Belgrade as its capital with a representative academic base of its expression reflected the widely accepted attitude of the government with the monumental character of public buildings, designed in the style of high-academicism. As the building of the central and the most important postal institution in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, the Palace of the Main Post Office is an important testimony to the development of postal services and activities, from its founding to the present. On the other hand, its striking position at the crossroads of two important city roads, is one of the most important visual benchmarks of the city center. At the same time, the monumentality of the continent and the representativeness of the external processing classify it among the major examples of academic architecture of Belgrade. ==References Literature == * == External links == Category:Buildings and structures in Belgrade Category:Post office buildings ","title":"General Post Office, Belgrade"},{"id":"54111444","text":"The 1914 Presbyterian Blue Hose football team represented Presbyterian College during the 1914 college football season.

In all of his endeavours he became outstanding in his field, gaining international acclaim for his discoveries and publications. In February 1992 he was officially commemorated by the naming of the road Brittlebank Circuit, in the suburb of Banks, in Canberra, Australian Capital Territory.Canberra's suburb and street names: origins and meanings 1992, Deptartment of the Environment, Land and Planning, A.C.T. Government, Canberra, ACT, Tuggeranong volume, p. 2. == Ancestors == From 17th to 19th centuries the Brittlebank family was well-established in Wirksworth, in the Peak District of Derbyshire in England. The family prospered as (amongst other things) members of the legal profession and owners of lead mines. In 1700 Hugh Brittlebank (1675–1764) moved from Wirksworth to the village at the centre of lead mining, Winster, becoming the owner of the substantial manor house and grounds, Oddo House.'Oddo House - Winster' 2018, Derbyshire Peak District National Park Heritage, accessed 15 Jun 2018, url: http://www.derbyshireheritage.co.uk/Menu/Townsandvillages/Winster/oddo- house.php. Hugh Brittlebank's family came to own most of the village of Winster. They were at the centre of dramatic events in 1821 when they seem to have overstepped the mark, as the Times (London, England) reported on 2 June 1821: three of Hugh's great-great-grandsons forced a local doctor, William Cuddie, into a duel at which he was mortally wounded. The shooter, William Brittlebank, then disappeared completely. The other two brothers involved, Andrew and Francis, were tried for murder but were acquitted, in August 1821.Small, C 2001, ‘The Brittlebank Murder’, ‘’Winster Local History Group, Newsletter’’, no. 20, May 2001, accessed 17 Jun 2018, url: http://www.winster.org/pages/History/Newsletters/Newsletter20.pdf.Lomax, S and Smith, R 2012, 'Doctor dies in duel', Reflections, accessed 18 Jun 2018, url: http://www.reflections-magazine.com. The Peak District, Derbyshire, England == Parents and siblings == A fourth brother, not involved in the duel, was Thomas Brittlebank (1797–1838) whose son, Andrew William Thomas Brittlebank (1838–1877), was recorded in the 1871 England Census Ancestry.com 2004, 1871 England Census, Ancestry.com Operations Inc, Provo, UT, USA. as having moved away from the traditional family village of Winster to a small seaside village, Hornsea, in the neighbouring county of Yorkshire. He was accompanied by his wife Ellen Sarah Leese (1837–1906), his mother-in-law Mary Leese (1805–1877), and three sons: Lewis Oswald (1861–1877), Charles Clifton (1863–1945) and Thomas Andrew (1865–1948). The head of the house was not employed – he enjoyed a private income derived from his investments. Andrew WT Brittlebank took his wife and children overseas, spending two years in Vanuatu (known then as the Spanish East Indies, and later as the New Hebrides), before going to Brisbane, Queensland, Australia, where the passenger list of the ship Sam Mendel records their arrival on 28 July 1875 McCarthy, GJ 2012, 'Brittlebank, Charles Clifton (1862 - 1945)', Encyclopedia of Australian Science 2015, accessed 5 Jun 2018, url: http://www.eoas.info/biogs/P000263b.htm.Ancestry.com 2010, Queensland, Australia, Passenger Lists, 1848–1912, Ancestry.com Operations Inc, Provo, UT, USA. In 1876 and 1877 The Brisbane Courier frequently reported local waves of epidemics such as smallpox, malaria and influenza. In March and April 1877 Andrew WT Brittlebank and his eldest son, Lewis Oswald, both died and were buried in the South Brisbane Cemetery in Plot 11a, graves 268 and 269. Administrative procedures appear to have taken two years, for the Brisbane Telegraph reported, on Friday 14 March 1879, page 3, that \\"his widow Ellen S.

However, they did not remain in Tasmania, but returned to the mainland and finally put down roots in Myrniong, near Bacchus Marsh, in the state of Victoria. The Bacchus Marsh Express, 28 November 1885, page 2, announced that a mixed farm of 363 acres (approximately 150 hectares) was up for lease, after the death of the owner, William Dunbar in July 1884. It appears that the Brittlebanks took the lease, because the Bacchus Marsh Express reported in 1888 that the two brothers were the owners: > The Messrs. Brittlebank, the present owners of Dunbar's farm, have done > excellent work, and have almost entirely eradicated the rabbits from their > property. They have also erected a quantity of wire net fence. - Bacchus > Marsh Express, 17 Nov 1888, p.3. Throughout their lives, the work of the brothers Charles and Thomas, whether joint or individual, contributed significantly to the dissemination of new knowledge of Australian plants, animals and geology. The Victorian Naturalist summarized their contribution as follows: > They compiled one of the first comprehensive bird lists for the area [the > Werribee Gorge].

They had only one child, Cyril Clifton, born in Myrniong in 1895. When World War I occurred he enlisted in Australian 13th Light Horse Regiment in May 1915. After fighting at Gallipoli and on many of the battlefields on the Western Front, and having survived typhoid and various wounds, he died of influenza on 25 May 1918. He was buried in Etretat Cemetery, Le Havre, Haute-Normandie, France. His grave is listed on the Etretat Churchyard Extension web site .Australia, Australian War Memorial, Roll Of Honour: Cyril Clifton Brittlebank, url: https://www.awm.gov.au/collection/R1677697. A couple of months before the wedding of Charles and Sarah, Brittlebank's brother Thomas Andrew had married Marion Margaret Myers (1869–1932), on 10 June 1894. They had three children. Their eldest son, Andrew Buxton Brittlebank, was born 10 February 1895. Like his cousin Cyril, he enlisted in 1915, as reported in the Melton Express on 19 June 1915, page 3. He became a corporal in Australian 59th Battalion, was repeatedly wounded, and died of pneumonia on 15 Oct 1917. He was buried in Aeroplane Cemetery, Ypres, Flanders, Belgium, and is listed on the cemetery's web site .Ancestry.com 2010, Australia, Death Index, 1787–1985, Ancestry.com Operations Inc, Provo, UT, USA. As described on the history page of the Shrine's web site , the Shrine of Remembrance in Melbourne, Victoria, was originally erected to commemorate the 19,000 Victorian victims of World War I who, like the Brittlebank cousins, were buried overseas, leaving their Australian families without graves at which to mourn. The name Buxton was the maiden name of Andrew William Thomas Brittlebank's maternal grandmother, Margaret Buxton (1779–1820) who lived in Thorpe, Derbyshire, England. Furthermore, Buxton was also the name of one of the most important towns in the Peak District of Derbyshire. Thus the name may have held sentimental value for the expatriate Thomas Andrew Brittlebank who had been brought to Australia as a child. He and his wife Marion gave each of their children the middle name of Buxton: Andrew (1895–1917), Olive (1897–1984) and Tom (1899–1966). == Career == The value of Charles Clifton Brittlebank's work can be appreciated from the excitement generated by the announcement of a discovery Smith B 2013, 'The holy grail of Victorian insects rises from archives', The Age, 29 September 2013, url: https://www.theage.com.au/national/victoria/the-holy- grail-of-victorian-insects-rises-from-archives-20130928-2ulag.html. reported on 29 September 2013, on The Age web site : > Researchers have found \\"the holy grail of entomology\\" - a long-lost guide to > Victoria's insects written by pioneer researcher Charles French.

After that time the brothers both lived at No. 48 York Street, Caulfield, near Melbourne. Charles pre-deceased his younger brother by three years, dying in 1945, aged 83. He is buried in the family grave in the Maddingley Central Cemetery, in Bacchus Marsh, Victoria. The cemetery has been in use since the 1860s.

After the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, the newly independent Ukraine retained its seat. ==Activities in the United Nations== As of 2017, Ukraine is currently serving its fourth term as a non-permanent member in the United Nations Security Council in the Eastern European Group having previously served its terms in 1947–48, 1984–85 and 2000–01. Following the annexation of Crimea to Russia in 2014, UN member states voted to retain recognition of Crimea as part of Ukraine. ==History== Ukraine in the Soviet Union (1945–1991) Ukraine signed the Charter of the United Nations as the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic on 26 June 1945 and came into force on 24 October 1945. Ukraine was among the first countries that signed the United Nations Charter, becoming a founding member of the United Nations among 51 countries. This provided the Soviet Union (a permanent Security Council member with veto powers) with another vote in the General Assembly. The latter aspect of the 1944 clauses, however, was never fulfilled and the republic's defense matters were managed by the Soviet Armed Forces and the Defense Ministry. Dmitry Manuilsky, head of the Ukrainian delegation at the United Nations Conference on International Organization, held in April–June 1945 in San Francisco, was elected Chairman of the First Committee, which elaborated the Preamble and Chapter 1 (Purposes and Principles) of the United Nations Charter. Until 1958 the permanent mission of Ukraine was led by the Minister of Foreign Affairs rather than the permanent representative. Another right that was granted but never used until 1991 was the right of the Soviet republics to secede from the union,Subtelny, p. 421. which was codified in each of the Soviet constitutions. Accordingly, Article 69 of the Constitution of the Ukrainian SSR stated: \\"The Ukrainian SSR retains the right to willfully secede from the USSR.\\" However, a republic's theoretical secession from the union was virtually impossible and unrealistic in many ways until after Gorbachev's perestroika reforms. Independent Ukraine (since 1991) During the events of the dissolution of the Soviet Union, on 26 August 1991, the Permanent Representative of the Ukrainian SSR, Hennadiy Udovenko, informed the office of the Secretary General of the United Nations that his permanent mission to this international assembly would officially be designated as representing Ukraine.U.N. Mission stresses statehood of Ukraine, The Ukrainian Weekly (1 September 1991) Since 1992, Ukraine has consistently supported peaceful, negotiated settlements to disputes. It has participated in the quadripartite talks on the conflict in Moldova and promoted a peaceful resolution to conflict in the post-Soviet state of Georgia. Ukraine also has made a substantial contribution to UN peacekeeping operations. During the Ukrainian crisis between 2013 and 2014, the UN adopted Resolution 68/262 on March 27, 2014 entitled Territorial integrity of Ukraine by the sixty-eighth session of the United Nations General Assembly in response to the Russian annexation of Crimea. The non-binding resolution, which was supported by 100 United Nations member states, affirmed the General Assembly's commitment to the territorial integrity of Ukraine within its internationally recognized borders and underscored the invalidity of the 2014 Crimean referendum. Eleven nations voted against the resolution, while 58 abstained, and a further 24 states were absent when the vote took place. ==See also== {align=right valign=top valign=top } *Foreign relations of Ukraine *Permanent Representative of Ukraine to the United Nations ==References External links == * Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine * Permanent Mission of Ukraine to the United Nations United Nations Category:Soviet Union–Ukraine relations ","title":"Ukraine and the United Nations"},{"id":"54111563","text":"Sibongile Mlambo is a Zimbabwean actress based in the United States.

The Daily Telegraph. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan was in Washington that day to meet with U.S. President Donald Trump and watched the clashes from a distance. The clashes were decried as a Turkish attack on American protesters exercising their First Amendment rights, which guarantees freedom of speech and assembly. Turkey declined to apologize for the incident, blaming the protestors for provoking the response. Of the 24 men who were filmed attacking protesters, nearly a month passed before any were charged with a crime. However, on June 6, a U.S. House resolution unanimously passed calling for all Turkish security guards involved to be charged and prosecuted under United States law. On June 14, two men were arrested for assault in connection to the attacks, while arrest warrants were issued for the bodyguards. The charges were dropped in March 2018, days before high level meetings between US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Erdoğan. ==Clashes== Erdoğan just before the clash. Video from Voice of America. Video of the clashes by Voice of America. Video of the clashes by Voice of America. On May 16, 2017, protesters, including Turks, Kurds, Armenians, Assyrians, and Greeks. gathered in front of the Turkish Ambassador's Residence in Washington on the same day Trump held a meeting with Erdoğan. Shortly after Erdoğan arrived at the ambassador's residence, tensions began to rise between the two sides of the protest. The D.C. police urged the pro-Erdoğan side to retreat. However, a video widely circulated on social media showed that the pro-Erdoğan supporters and Turkish security guards instead dodged the police officers to attack the peaceful protesters. The attackers punched and kicked people lying on the ground in fetal position repeatedly, causing several to bleed. Another video showed Erdoğan watching the clashes from a distance, prompting speculation that Erdoğan personally ordered the attack. In the video, a member of Erdoğan's security detail speaks to him in his car. Subsequently, that member of the detail spoke to another member of the security detail who ran towards the crowd and appeared to instigate the clashes. Two men were arrested at the scene – one for aggravated assault and the other for assaulting a police officer. Two members of the presidential security detail were also detained, but were released after a short while. ==Immediate reactions== United States Immediately following the events, U.S. lawmakers condemned Turkey's actions during the clashes. Republican Senator John McCain called for the expulsion of the Turkish ambassador. Democratic Senator Claire McCaskill agreed, saying \\"They were assaulting these people on US soil. Turkish Ambassador should be kicked out of country.\\" A group of nearly 30 Democratic lawmakers, led by Representative Carolyn Maloney, wrote a letter to Secretary of State Rex Tillerson demanding that the Turkish guards be \\"arrested, prosecuted and jailed.\\" Tillerson said that he was going to wait for the findings from a State Department investigation before taking any action. On May 18, Under Secretary of State Tom Shannon summoned Turkish Ambassador after the events. Washington, D.C. D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser called the clashes a \\"violent attack on a peaceful demonstration,\\" and said it \\"is an affront to DC values and our rights as Americans.\\" On May 17, the D.C. Police Department announced that two individuals had been arrested in connection with the clashes, and stated \\"The actions seen outside the Turkish Embassy yesterday in Washington, D.C. stand in contrast to the First Amendment rights and principles we work tirelessly to protect each and every day.\\" The department announced further cooperation with the United States State Department and United States Secret Service \\"to identify and hold all subjects accountable for their involvement in the altercation.\\" Turkey The Turkish Embassy in Washington accused the protesters of starting the clashes by \\"aggressively provoking\\" Turkish-American citizens who had gathered to greet the president, leading them to respond in \\"self-defense\\". On May 18, Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu accused senior U.S. diplomat Brett McGurk of supporting the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), a group considered to be a terrorist organization by both the United States and Turkey. On May 22, Turkey summoned U.S. Ambassador John R.

The resolution, which passed in a unanimous 397–0 vote, called for \\"any Turkish security official who directed or participated in efforts by Turkish security forces to suppress peaceful protests outside of the Turkish ambassador's residence\\" to be charged and prosecuted under U.S. law. The measure was similar to a Senate demand to waive diplomatic immunity for security forces involved in the assault. Congressman Steny Hoyer called the incident an outrage that the U.S. cannot tolerate. Congressman Ed Royce called the violence an \\"act of suppression on American soil\\". Speaker of the House Paul Ryan called for the Turkish government to \\"finally accept responsibility for this egregious incident and apologise to those who were harmed\\". The day following the vote, Turkey dismissed the resolution saying that it would \\"distort and politicize\\" matters and that the measure was \\"against the spirit of alliance and partnership\\" between the two countries.  Other countries  As a consequence of this violence, the German government, host of the 2017 G20 Hamburg summit in July 2017, reportedly rejected the attendance of twelve guards from Turkey's presidential security team.  Arrests and warrants  On June 14, 2017, two men, Sinan Narin of Virginia and Eyup Yildirim of New Jersey, were arrested for aggravated assault in connection to the clashes. On June 15, the United States issued 16 arrest warrants, 12 of which were for presidential security guards involved in the clashes. President Erdoğan criticized the United States for issuing the arrest warrants, saying \\"They have issued arrest warrants for 12 of my bodyguards. What kind of law is this? If my bodyguards cannot protect me then why am I bringing them to America with me?\\". Erdoğan also claimed that D.C. police failed to intervene during the clashes. Turkey summoned Ambassador John R. Bass and stated that Turkish citizens cannot be held responsible for the clashes since U.S. and local security authorities failed to take the proper measures during Erdoğan's state visit. In August 2017, a grand jury indicted 19 defendants in connection with the clashes. The 19 defendants included the 16 individuals criminally charged in June. Fifteen of the defendants are Turkish security officials. All the defendants were indicted on a charge of conspiracy to commit a crime of violence. Additionally, many of the defendants were indicted on charges such as assault with a dangerous weapon and aggravated assault.  September phone call between Erdoğan and Trump  In a PBS NewsHour interview on September 19, 2017 Erdoğan said that Trump had called him the previous week to apologize for the incident, and promised to follow up on it during future talks with the Turkish government. A spokesperson for the White House said that while many issues were discussed during the call, Trump had not offered an apology. ==Charges dropped== On March 23, 2018 the Department of Justice announced that it had dropped all charges against eleven of the fifteen members of the Turkish Presidential Counter Attack Team who had been charged with assault. The charges were dropped days before high-level meetings between Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Erdoğan in Ankara. Tillerson told Erdoğan that the dropped charges were an example of how the U.S. had addressed Turkey's grievances. Contradicting earlier statements, State Department spokesperson Heather Nauert denied political pressure was behind the decision and claimed that a lack of evidence prompted them to drop the charges. Civil lawsuits In May 2018, two lawsuits were filed by victims of the Turkish attack. Fearing Turkish reprisal, many of the plaintiffs withheld their names from the case. One lawsuit filed on May 3 seeks more than $100 million in damages while the other requests an unspecified amount. The Turkish government claimed to be protected against legal action by sovereign immunity. On February 6, 2020, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia ruled that Turkey was not protected by sovereign immunity, and that the case could proceed.

It was the 15th round of the 2001 CART season. Roberto Moreno won the shortened race by five seconds over Gil de Ferran and Michael Andretti. Moreno won his second and final CART race by passing multiple contenders throughout the race, also earning Patrick Racing its final victory in open-wheel racing in the process. de Ferran earned his fifth podium of 2001 and moved into first place in the points standings, but he still did not have a win for Team Penske at this point in the season. Andretti picked up his fourth podium of the year and his sixth overall at Vancouver. The race was marked by multiple incidents and crashes that forced CART officials to call a timed race that ended the event after two hours and 98 of the scheduled 100 laps. Despite starting on pole and leading the most laps, Alex Tagliani was forced to retire from the lead after 68 laps when his Ford-Cosworth engine let go in dramatic fashion, once again thwarting his attempts to take his first victory in the series. ==Report== Background Vancouver was the second Canadian stop for the CART teams after Toronto, and the series had seen massive swings in form from both drivers and teams. Rookie Bruno Junqueira, who had previously been scrapping for points in the midfield, scored his first win at the preceding race in Road America. After winning the race in Toronto, Michael Andretti had been plagued with multiple DNFs before finally finishing second at Road America and was looking to get his pursuit of the championship back on track. Defending series champion Gil de Ferran, after a lukewarm start to 2001, was beginning to power his way to the front of the point standings, coming to Vancouver on the heels of three consecutive top-5 finishes and a pole position at Mid-Ohio. His teammate, Helio Castroneves, was currently leading the standings by a slim margin over Kenny Bräck. But the big story going into Vancouver was the rise of Forsythe Racing and the string of good results by Canadian drivers Patrick Carpentier and Alex Tagliani. After struggling for points at the beginning of the year, their luck began to change after Tagliani scored his first career podium in front of the home fans in Toronto, followed by Carpentier scoring his first win at the next race at Michigan. From then on, both drivers had scored solid points in every race before Vancouver, including two more podiums for Carpentier. Analysts expected both Forsythe Racing drivers to continue their momentum now that they were back on Canadian soil. Also going into the weekend, CART announced a three- year extension for the Vancouver race, meaning that the 2002 season would see three Canadian races, after it was confirmed that Montreal would host the series at Circuit Gilles Villeneuve.  Practice and Qualifying  Practice would be a challenge for the teams and the drivers, as the weather forecasts called for light showers on Friday and again during qualifying on Saturday. For morning practice on Friday, however, the inclement weather stayed away long enough for the full session to be completed. Many driver experienced grip issues on the slick temporary street course, especially at the 90-degree right-handed Turn 1. Dario Franchitti stalled twice on track during the first session with fuel pressure issues while Max Wilson nudged into the Turn 12 barriers, causing moderate damage to the nose of the car. At the end of the session, Tony Kanaan had managed to top the time sheets with a 1:01.958 followed by Cristiano da Matta with a 1:01.968 and de Ferran with a 1:02.302. The top twelve cars were separated by less than one second. Although clouds were building around Vancouver during the Friday afternoon practice, no rain fell on the track and thus the session continued as normal. The pace began to pick up as drivers started putting in more and more fast laps. The only major interruption of the day came when Junqueira hit the wall in Turn 10 and damaged the right suspension about twenty minutes into the session, bringing out the red flag. The quickest laps came right at the end, with Tagliani clocking a 1:01.230 on his final lap of the day, followed by Castroneves at 1:01.438 and Roberto Moreno at 1:01.506. Bräck, Franchitti, Wilson, Bryan Herta, and Alex Zanardi all moved to their backup cars during the session. The rain that was predicted for the weekend finally fell later that night and soaked the track, and the result going into qualifying day was a track with standing water from Turn 8 to Turn 12 and dry patches of asphalt everywhere else. Drivers approached the track with rain tires at the start of Saturday morning practice, but as the session went on drivers began to put on slicks as the track dried out. Castroneves set the fastest time of the weekend with a 1:00.742, the first driver to break out of the 1:01 second range. de Ferran followed up in second with a 1:01.235 and da Matta came in third with a 1:01.503. When qualifying began later that day, the track had completely dried out as the field was split into two groups for the afternoon session. Junqueira topped Group 1 with a 1:01.194, followed by Max Papis with a 1:01.668 and Adrian Fernández with a 1:01.711. Group 2 saw many drivers testing the track limits, or in some cases, exceeding them. da Matta, just two minutes after the beginning of the session, slid into the barriers at Turn 12, damaging his front wing and forcing him to use the backup car for the rest of the session. Ten minutes later, Moreno, who at the time was running third in the session and fourth overall, lost power on the backstretch and was forced to retire the car. Tagliani, meanwhile, had put his car on provisional pole with a 1:00.872. Little changed at the top of lap charts until minutes before the end of the session when Carpentier put in a blistering lap and qualified second overall with a 1:00.924. Immediately afterward, however, he slid into the barrier at Turn 6 and stalled the car. Compatriot Paul Tracy, just ahead of him, crashed into the barriers at Turn 7 and damaged the front suspension. CART officials threw the red-and-checkered flag, ending the session. Qualifying had produced an all-Canadian front row, much to the delight of the Vancouver race fans and Forsythe Racing. This was Tagliani's second pole position in his CART career and his first on a street course; he was presented the Greg Moore Pole Trophy by Ric Moore, father of the hometown favorite who was tragically killed during the 1999 Marlboro 500 in Fontana. Coincidentally, this was the first all-Forsythe front row since Milwaukee in 1998, where Carpentier and Moore also went 1-2 in qualifying. The top four cars were all separated by less than one-hundredth of a second. Nevertheless, de Ferran, who was starting 3rd with a 1:00.933, was less than enthusiastic with his qualifying performance:  Race  Morning warmup saw threatening showers looming in the mountains outside of Vancouver, but for the time being the track was still dry. da Matta led the 30-minute session before the race began. The green flag waved for the first time just after 2:00 PM as Tagliani led the field into Turn 1. Junqueira, trying to pull to the outside of the queue, clipped the front of Tracy and spun; he managed to keep it out of the tire barriers but ended up stalling the car. Meanwhile, side-to-side contact between Bräck and Castroneves meant that the latter was forced off-track at Turn 3, where he also stalled the car. Junqueira was able to get restarted relatively quickly, but the position of Castroneves' car meant that a full- course caution was needed to get him refired. Both cars would head into the pits for service and go a lap down. During the opening caution, Alex Zanardi, Wilson, and Bryan Herta all went into the pits to top off on fuel, anticipating a strategy change later in the race. The green waved again on Lap 5, where Moreno was able to get around Bräck and take 4th place after starting 7th. Tagliani was looking to extend the gap between him and 2nd place Carpentier as the stint continued and by Lap 15 he had pulled out a five- second gap between them. On Lap 24, Moreno was finally able to get around de Ferran for 3rd place. At the same time, points-leader Castroneves came to a stop on the start-finish straight with an electrical problem, forcing the second caution of the day. This was the signal for all the cars to pit for fuel and tires, with Tagliani leading the way. The two Forsythe cars remained 1-2, while thanks to a quicker pit stop, de Ferran was able to edge out of the pits ahead of Moreno and retake the position. The only cars that did not pit were Scott Dixon, Memo Gidley, and Wilson; this slotted Dixon into 2nd and Gidley into 4th. Castroneves was able to get the car restarted, but he was now three laps down. The field went back to green on Lap 30 with Tagliani again pulling away. Tracy, who was trying to tuck in behind Fernández going into Turn 6, was clipped from behind by da Matta, who lost part of his front wing. Suffering from a right rear puncture, Tracy pulled onto the runoff area at Turn 1 and retired the car, the official cause being a gearbox malfunction that resulted from the collision with da Matta. The race continued under green as Tracy's car was removed. From Papis in 9th on back, the field was running nose-to-tail. On Lap 34, Moreno once again passed de Ferran on track to take 4th place. From there he immediately pulled away and began hounding Carpentier for 2nd place. One lap later, Wilson was forced to pull off track at Turn 6 and retire from the race with a mechanical problem. On Lap 41 both Dixon and Gidley finally made their pit stops, falling down the order. At the same time, leader Tagliani was beginning to lap the field, going around Herta. Dixon, who was battling for position at the back of the pack with fresher tires, collided with Tora Takagi at Turn 6, forcing him off the track and stalling the car. Almost simultaneously, Zanardi hit the tire barriers going into Turn 7, spilling water that had collected from the previous night's rain all over the track. The 3rd caution came out as a result of Zanardi's retirement, while Dixon was able to get restarted, albeit he was now a lap down. This was Zanardi's 7th DNF of the season, the most of any drivers in the series. CART officials sent out the jet dryers to Turn 7 in order to dry the track during the caution; the cleanup took longer than expected as the water kept seeping back onto the track from the tire barrier. Finally, on Lap 51, the green flag came back out with Tagliani leading. Takagi, one lap down, was positioned behind Tagliani on the restart, and over the next several laps he tried to get around Tagliani and get back on the lead lap. Unable to pass, the two cars raced ahead of the field while Bräck and Moreno kept pace with Carpentier. Finally, on Lap 69, Papis and Andretti pulled into the pits for their scheduled stops, both falling back down the order. Meanwhile, the race took a dramatic turn as Tagliani, who had reported a strange noise to his crew just laps earlier, was helpless as a large plume of smoke erupted from the back of his car, forcing him to pull off-course and retire from first place. Since Tagliani had managed to avoid bringing out a caution, his teammate Carpentier and 3rd place Bräck pulled into the pits for their scheduled stops, handing the lead to Moreno. Moreno then gave up the lead to Cristiano da Matta one lap later when he made his pit stop. The drama continued when Papis clouted the wall in Turn 4, destroying the right-side suspension, putting him out of the race and bringing out the full-course caution. The yellow gave the rest of the field a perfect opportunity to pit as da Matta, Franchitti, and Jimmy Vasser each made a stop for fuel and tires. This handed the lead to Michel Jourdain Jr. and Oriol Servià, who had only made one pit stop so far. Both cars would pit a few laps later, now giving the lead to Maurício Gugelmin. While the order continued to shuffle under yellow, CART officials penalized da Matta, Franchitti, and Vasser for pitting when the pits were closed by forcing all three drivers to the back of the queue. On Lap 80, the green came back out with Gugelmin leading and Moreno and de Ferran behind. At Turn 1, de Ferran braked hard on the inside and forced Moreno wide to take 2nd place away. 4th place Bräck misjudged his braking point and went wide at the same corner, dropping him back several positions. Just behind him, Fernández slid into the tire barriers and stalled the car, ending his day. The race continued under green as de Ferran stormed past Gugelmin on the back straight to take 1st place. At Turn 6, da Matta tangled with Takagi, sending the former into the tire barriers and forcing him to retire as well. Officials finally waved the full-course yellow in order to get both da Matta and Fernández off the track. The yellow meant that every car except Castroneves and Herta was now back on the lead lap and could go the rest of the race without pitting, setting up a field-wide battle for position near the end of the race. The green waved on Lap 85 with de Ferran leading, but more trouble ensued when Bräck ran into the back of Carpentier, sending both cars off track and giving Carpentier a flat right rear tire. Bräck fell from 5th to 8th place as a result of the incident, while Carpentier was forced to limp around the circuit back to pits to change tires; he would be put a lap down. Just a few corners later, Vasser ran off- track after punting the back of Christian Fittipaldi, who had locked up going into the corner. He severely damaged his front wing and was forced to retire from the race. At the same time, Gugelmin was struggling to keep pace with the leaders and began to fall back; going through Turn 6 he was passed by Andretti and Kanaan when he clipped the front wing of Servià, who was also trying to pass. Despite the carnage and bits of debris on track, CART officials kept the race under green. On Lap 87 they announced that the race would be timed and would not go the full 100 laps. On Lap 89 Moreno passed de Ferran to take the lead with less than ten minutes remaining in the race. From then on, he pulled away, leaving the rest of the field behind. The rest of the race was incident- free, and Moreno remained unchallenged as he took the checkered flag for his second career win.  Post-Race  Moreno was incredibly emotional as he circled around for his victory lap, performing donuts on the start-finish straight and celebrating on victory lane with his team and the Brazilian flag draped around his shoulders. A very popular driver in the series, he was holding back tears as he raised the winner's trophy and gave interviews. For Moreno, this would be his second and final CART victory, as well as the last for Patrick Racing before it folded in 2004. Despite the good result, Moreno would have horrendous luck for the rest of the season, scoring only two points at Surfer's Paradise for pole position and leading the most laps; he would ultimately DNF at five of the last six races of the season and was dropped from the team for 2002. Moreno would come back to CART in 2003 racing for Herdez Competition and score one final career podium at Miami. Moreno was also the sixth different winner at Vancouver in as many years and he gave Toyota its first win of the season on a street course. de Ferran recorded his fifth podium of the year, continuing an upward trend that would ultimately earn him two wins and the season championship. His 2nd place also vaulted him into 1st place in the drivers' standings ahead of his teammate Castroneves, becoming the third different points leader in as many races. Andretti was pleased with his podium finish, as he continued his streak of strong points finishes in Canada and earned his sixth podium in Vancouver. He would go on to score another podium in Surfer's Paradise by the end of the season. This would be Alex Zanardi's final race before his career-ending crash at the 2001 American Memorial in Germany two weeks later. ==Qualifying== {  style=\\"font-size:95%;\\" - !colspan=6September 1, 2001 - Qualifying Speeds - !

The series was created by Renae de Liz, with colors, inks, and letters by her husband, Ray Dillon. It functions as a modern retelling of Wonder Woman's Golden Age origin, with heavy influence from the original comics by William Moulton Marston. ==Publication history== The digital-first series began in November 2015 and consisted of 27 chapters released weekly. It was collected in 9 single issues throughout 2016, then published in hardcover December 13, 2016. A proposed second volume was in the works until it was cancelled by DC. A four issue mini-series published in 1986 featured the same title. ==Plot== Volume One As a child, Diana senses danger looming towards her island, Themyscira. She coerces the Captain of the Guard, Alcippe into training her in the arts of battle. As she grows older, Diana becomes a fearsome fighter, though she longs to find the answer to her ominous feelings. One day, she finds Air Force pilot Steve Trevor crash on the island. She keeps him a secret from the other Amazons as she tends to his wounds, though they eventually discover his presence. Diana wins the competition to return Steve to the United States, where she meets Etta Candy and the Holliday Girls. Meanwhile, Ares and Hades send their champion, Thomas Byde (calling himself the Duke of Deception) to aid the Nazis during World War II. Diana disguises herself as a nurse to get onto the front lines, but is easily defeated by the Duke of Deception. She later loses her powers completely by turning away her patron gods, deciding to live a peaceful life with Steve and Etta. Quickly after, Diana is summoned by duty to return to the battle, despite the loss of magic in her equipment. She manages to defeat the Duke of Deception with the aid of Pegasus, then regains her powers in time to defeat the deadly Titan. Volume Two A second and third volumes were planned for The Legend of Wonder Woman but were cancelled by DC Comics. Writer Renae de Liz later posted on her Twitter account her plans for future volumes had included various villains from Wonder Woman's lore, such as Cheetah, Blue Snowman, Giganta, and Circe. ==Characters== *Princess Diana/Wonder Woman The princess of the Amazons. As in the main DC Universe, Diana won the right to become Wonder Woman and return injured air force pilot Steve Trevor back to \\"man's world.\\" *Etta Candy A boisterous student at Holliday College, Etta immediately befriended Diana when she arrived at the United States. Etta continued to play a large role in the series, joining Diana in her adventures as her sidekick. *Steve Trevor A young pilot who crash landed on Paradise Island. After being brought back to the United States by Diana, he continued to play a prominent role in Diana's life, eventually becoming her romantic interest. *Duke of Deception The primary antagonist of the story. Once a mortal man named Thomas Boyd, the Duke of Deception served as Ares's champion. *Queen Hippolyta Queen of the Amazons and Diana's mother. *Alcippe General of the Amazons and presumably Hippolyta's lover. She trained Diana in the ways of battle, and eventually revealed her former name to be Philippus. *Priscilla Rich A wealthy socialite who has allied with the Nazi party. *Antiope and Melanippe Sisters of Queen Hippolyta. Antiope served Ares while Melanippe was a priestess of Hades. Both plot against Queen Hippolyta presumably under the orders of their respective Gods. *Pegasus A mythical creature that aided Diana in her journey. *Holliday Girls A group of college students that help Diana on her adventure. The group consists of Etta, Glamora Treat, Lita Little, and Millie and Tillie Heyday. *Lt. Lawrence Stone Steve's commanding officer and Etta's romantic interest. *Perry White A young reporter that Diana questions about the Duke of Deception. *Alfred Pennyworth A young child who the Holliday Girls recruit to help in their performance in the United Kingdom. *Troia An amazon that was in Diana's class as a child. *Jumpa Diana's kanga which is briefly seen on Themyscira. *Pamela Smuthers Etta Candy's arch-rival. ==Follow up== Despite the cancellation of the second volume of The Legend of Wonder Woman, DC Comics published a follow-up story written by Renae de Liz set in the same universe in the Wonder Woman: 75th Anniversary Special. In the story, Wonder Woman confronts Baroness von Gunther and her subordinates Red Panzer and Mavis. After using the lasso of truth on the Baroness, she discovers that the Baroness's daughter, Gerta, had been kidnapped by the Nazi forces in order to force Baroness von Gunther's compliance. Wonder Woman saves the young girl and returns her to her mother, who vows that she has been set free.Wonder Woman: 75th Anniversary Special (2017) ==References== Category:2016 graphic novels Category:Wonder Woman titles ","title":"The Legend of Wonder Woman"},{"id":"54111708","text":"Friedrich Ahlers-Hestermann drawn by Federzeichnung von Jules Pascin, 1906.

He was the nephew and pupil of William Green, who was piper to the Duke of Northumberland, and was later appointed as his assistant in this role. He first played in public together with his uncle, for instance at a meeting of the Society for the Improvement of the English Marygold, in 1816.Durham County Advertiser, 5 October 1816, http://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000612/18161005/015/0002 However, he was already performing alone at this time; a newspaper article Durham County Advertiser, 9 November 1816. states that the Duchess's Piper being prevented from playing there by illness, his young nephew Robert Nicholson, then 18, \\"just the age of the late famed Wm Lamshaw, when he bore away the prize at a musical match at Elsdon Court Baron\\" , deputised for him, playing for the first time unassisted. It is clear from this that Green would normally have been expected to play at this event. Again, the following year, at a celebration of Earl Percy's wedding, in North Shields, Nicholson deputised for Green, who said he was unable to attend the event at short notice.Durham County Advertiser, 14 June 1817, http://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000612/18170614/006/0002 It may well be that Green was deliberately excusing himself from these events, so that his nephew would get opportunities to perform in his own right. He played again in an official capacity that December, at a celebration of the birthday of Lord Prudhoe,Durham County Advertiser 20 December 1817, http://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000612/18171220/013/0002 in this account he is referred to as assisting \\"the Duchess's pipers\\", and called \\"the Percy piper\\", suggesting some measure of official recognition from the Duke. He played again for the Society for the Improvement of the English Marygold on various occasions until 1823, together with Green. An account of their playing for the Society in 1822, stated that \\"Fitzmaurice, Allen, Lamshaw, or Hair, never performed better\\"; it also refers to the \\"present improved form\\" of the pipes - in 1822 this would probably refer to the keyed instruments developed by Robert Reid. It also confirms that \\"the revival of northern music... constitutes one of the most prominent objects of the Society.\\" Durham County Advertiser, 7 September 1822. http://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000612/18220907/010/0002 In 1824, at the Tynemouth Fair in May, \\"many gentlemen dined at the Northumberland Arms, and were delighted with the ancient music of the Duchess of Northumberland's pipers\\" - these would have been Green and Nicholson.Durham County Advertiser 8 May 1824, http://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000612/18240508/022/0003 In William Green's obituary, particular mention is made of their innovative duet playing, with one playing the air, and the other playing the accompaniment. Previously, the instrument was primarily a solo instrument - harmonies would not have been feasible when the instrument's range was only a single octave, which was the case until the beginning of the 19th century. Sources for his later life are much scarcer. He was a witness at William Green's marriage in Alnwick, in 1825. The Duchess's pipers, that is William Green and Robert Nicholson, played at Ovingham Fair in 1826. There seems to be no later dateable reference to him as a piper performing in public. Green was witness at Nicholson's marriage to Margaret Dodds, in St. Nicholas' Church, Newcastle, in 1831. Nicholson died in Morpeth, on 11 October 1842, in the Black Swan, in King Street (now called Back Riggs), \\"unrivalled as a musician on the Northumberland small pipes, and was one of the Duchess of Northumberland's late pipers.\\"Durham County Advertiser, 21 October 1842. http://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000612/18421021/028/0003 In the 1851 census, Margaret Nicholson, a widow, is listed as innkeeper of the Black Swan. As all her children were born before 1842, the identification of her as Robert's widow is very likely. Two years after Nicholson's death, Thomas Chisholm was appointed as piper to the Duke of Northumberland for the Manor of Tynemouth, as his successor in the role. Newcastle Journal, 16 November 1844. http://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000243/18441116/007/0002 He performed at several local events in this capacity until 1848, but moved to Newcastle shortly after this. ==References== Category:1798 births Category:1842 deaths Category:Northumbria Category:Northumbrian music ","title":"Robert Nicholson (piper)"},{"id":"54111738","text":"The James T. Saban Lookout, also known as the High Park Lookout, is a fire lookout tower located in Bighorn National Forest near Ten Sleep, Wyoming in Washakie County, Wyoming. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2016. ==Description== The James T. Saban Lookout is a unique fire lookout tower. It is a high roof, fourteen foot (14') by fourteen foot (14') structure made of stone and natural wood. ==History== Constructed in 1942 by the Civilian Conservation Corps, the lookout was originally named \\"High Park Lookout\\". It was built in Bighorn National Forest and the facility is located just south of U.S. Highway 16 and about 15 miles east of Ten Sleep. James Saban was born in 1901 in Shell, Wyoming. He was enrolled in the Billings Polytechnic Institute for three years. Saban then completed a ninety-day course at the School of Forestry at the University of Montana. His Forest Service career began in 1922 in Bighorn National Park. Passing his Forest Ranger examination in 1923, he then went on to serve in eight different National Forests: Chugach, Selway, Lolo, Flathead, Coeur d’Alene, Medicine Bow, Chippewa, and Wyoming National Forests. He resigned due to poor health and was appointed as a foreman of the Civilian Conservation Corps. In August 1937, he was assigned to Ten Sleep Camp F-35. About three weeks later, the Blackwater Fire was started by a lightning strike. Three days later, a cold front brought gusty winds. As a result, Saban and seven other men were trapped and killed in a draw. The lookout continued to be used to spot forest fires until 1972 when it was replaced by manned aircraft and went into private ownership. The lookout was renamed for James Torrey Saban in 2015, by order of the Chief of the United States Forest Service. ==References== Category:National Register of Historic Places in Wyoming Category:Fire lookout towers in Wyoming] Category:Washakie County, Wyoming ","title":"James T.

Ward has scored music for film and television, and has written songs (both music and lyrics) for several stage plays and musicals. He is a recipient of the Los Angeles Ovation Award for Best World Premiere Musical, and the Los Angeles Drama Critics Circle Award and NAACP Theatre Award for Best Production. ==Film and television== Ward composed music soundtracks for the films Blues for Willadean (2012), Southern Baptist Sissies (2013), and A Very Sordid Wedding (2017). For television, he scored all episodes of the comedy Sordid Lives: The Series (2008) for LogoTV. He also had songs commissioned for the Animated Feature division of Warner Brothers Studios. ==Stage== Ward wrote the music and lyrics for the off-Broadway musical Hysterical Blindness (And Other Southern Tragedies That Have Plagued My Life Thus Far). The play was produced at 15 Van Dam (now the SoHo Playhouse) in 1994 and ran for seven months. The show was written with Ward’s friend, Emmy-Award winning character actor Leslie Jordan, who also starred in the production. In 2001 Ward first staged The Grave White Way, an original musical for which he wrote the book, music and lyrics. The show follows five dead stage actors attempting to gain admittance into Heaven by performing a revue of the flop musicals that condemned them to the musical theatre purgatory known as \\"The Grave White Way\\". The songs within the show satirize the history of bad musical theater from the 1930s to the present. One of the show's unique gimmicks was casting a theatre celebrity in every performance, including \\"Wicked\\" composer Stephen Schwartz, stage legend John Raitt, original Broadway \\"Dreamgirl\\" Loretta Devine, and Tony winners Billy Porter and Gregory Jbara. Variety called the show a “witty spoof of Broadway flops with a limitless future\\". Ward also wrote the music and lyrics for the musical Judy's Scary Little Christmas with co-writers David Church and James Webber. The show is a spoof of 1950’s television variety shows and contains campy humor based on the sensationalized personal lives of its main characters Judy Garland, Bing Crosby, Liberace, Ethel Merman, Richard Nixon, Lillian Hellman and Joan Crawford. Originally produced in Los Angeles in 2002, the show received nominations for Best Musical from L.A. Weekly and the Los Angeles Ovation Awards. Connie Champagne, who portrayed \\"Judy Garland\\" in the production, won the Ovation Award for \\"Best Actress in a Musical\\". The play is published by Samuel French and is frequently produced in cities across the United States. A recording of the original Los Angeles cast was released on CD in 2005. In 2003, Ward wrote original songs for the theatrical production The Trials and Tribulations of a Trailer Trash Housewife (also published by Samuel French). With a book by Del Shores, the play addresses the subject of domestic abuse. Originally produced at the Zephyr Theatre in Los Angeles, the show won \\"Best Production” from both the Los Angeles Drama Critics Circle Awards and the NAACP Theatre Awards. All five of the play’s original actors, including Beth Grant, Dale Dickey, David Steen, and future Academy Award winner Octavia Spencer, reprised their stage roles for the film version, which was retitled Blues for Willadean. Ward’s songs in the film (and play) were sung by Billboard Dance Recording Artist Debby Holiday, who portrayed “The Blues Singer”. ==References== Category:American dramatists and playwrights Category:American musical theatre composers Category:American musical theatre lyricists Category:American television composers Category:American film score composers Category:Living people Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Joe Patrick Ward"},{"id":"54111860","text":"Phintella kaptega is a jumping spider species in the genus Phintella that lives in Kenya.

Antoninus Liberalis' account  According to the first, Apollo seduced her by a trick. While Dryope tended the flocks of her father on Mount Oeta, she became the playmate of the hamadryads of the woods on Mount Oeta. The nymphs taught her to sing hymns to the gods and to dance. On one occasion, Dryope was seen by Apollo. In order to win her favours the god turned himself into a tortoise, of which the girls made a pet. The nymphs played with the animal and when Dryope had the tortoise on her lap, Apollo turned into a snake. The nymphs then got scared and abandoned her, and Apollo mated with in the form of the snake. Eventually she gave birth to her son Amphissus. Soon after Dryope married Andraemon, son of Oxylus. Amphissus eventually built a temple to his father Apollo in the city of Oeta, which he founded. Here the nymphs came to converse with Dryope, who had become a priestess of the temple. Fond of her, they took her with them and placed a poplar tree in her place. They then turned her into a nymph.Antoninus Liberalis, Metamorphoses 32 (trans. Celoria)  Ovid's account  In Ovid's version of the story,Ovid, Metamorphoses, IX.325ff. Dryope was wandering by a lake, suckling her baby Amphissus, when she saw the bright red flowers of the lotus tree, formerly the nymph Lotis who, when fleeing from Priapus, had been changed into a tree. Dryope wanted to give the blossoms to her baby to play with, but when she picked one the tree started to tremble and bleed. She tried to run away, but the blood of the tree had touched her skin and she found her feet rooted to the spot. She slowly began to turn into a black poplar, the bark spreading up her legs from the earth, but just before the woody stiffness finally reached her throat and as her arms began sprouting twigs her husband Andraemon heard her cries and came to her.

Pritchard was obsessed by the virtues of modern steam as compared to the internal combustion engine. He believed that for a fraction of the investment in the development of internal combustion engines, modern small- scale steam, externally fired engines, could prove to be of far greater efficiency and utility, exhibit better combustion characteristics, have lower emissions, greater fuel efficiency, higher torque and better power-to-weight ratios. His commitment saw him nearly single-handedly attempt to launch a steam driven car industry in Australia in the 1970s, an effort that ultimately sent him bankrupt. Towards the end of his life he continued to refine the engineering principles and designs of his engines and he left a design for what he referred to as \\"the best small steam engine the world has ever seen\\". Pritchard claimed that he had, \\"done for the steam engine what IBM did for the computer, made it small and personal\\". == Early years == Edward Pritchard was born in Caulfield, Melbourne, Australia on 28 August 1930. Pritchard was 12 years old when his father explained the operation of a steam engine to him, and by 14 he had worked out an infinitely variable gear device for his bicycle. He was to remain fascinated by steam power for the rest of his life. Starting from a scholarship he entered Melbourne Technical College, going on to complete his engineering degree at Melbourne University, and graduating in mechanical and automotive engineering from the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology. == Stanley Steamer == Pritchard bought a 1923 model Stanley Steamer in 1950 and restored it with the help of his father Arnold Pritchard. The car was the basis of their early experiments in steam power, with the main modifications being in the boiler and auxiliary systems. While they worked on the Steamer, Ted was designing a new engine that was being built by his father in their Caulfield, Melbourne workshop. == Bedford Truck == Steam-powered Bedford Truck, engine invented by Arnold and Edward Pritchard After 10 years of design and experimentation, the father and son team had bench tested their new 90-degree V-twin double-acting uniflow type engine and installed on the tray of a 5-ton Bedford truck. This truck was subsequently partially burnt out in the Ash Wednesday bushfires in 1983 while in storage on a farm in rural Victoria. The damaged but still substantially intact truck was collected by the National Museum of Australia and has been in the Mitchell Annex of the NMA since it was acquired. By 1963, the novel Pritchard engine had caused some interest at the engineering departments at Melbourne University and Melbourne Institute of Technology, and a group of students undertook adapting it as a sedan car power plant. Ted Pritchard quit his part-time job as a mechanical engineer to work full-time on the project with his father. == Pritchard Ford Falcon == By 1967, Ted Pritchard and his father had been able to install a new, smaller Pritchard steam engine into the engine well of a 1963 Ford Falcon and run convincing road tests around the suburbs of Melbourne.YouTube, Pritchard Steam Power Pty. Ltd. now had 47 shareholders, mostly friends and colleagues. In May 1968, Ted Pritchard, along with Ford Motor Company and two US companies that had also developed steam cars, gave evidence before the United States Senate Commerce Committee on Air and Water Pollution. It was at these hearings that Ted realised his engine was further advanced and more sophisticated than the current American designs. The project suffered a major setback in 1968 when Arnold Pritchard died, but a young motorcycle mechanic called Michael Edwards joined the company to continue helping Ted Pritchard with the car and engine. At this stage, the only input from the Australian government had been a $188 grant in 1969 from the Commonwealth Industrial Research and Development Board that Ted noted allowed \\"at least a week's further development\\". Edward (Ted) Pritchard in 1974 next to his steam-powered Ford Falcon. After multiple minor advancements in the engine design, by 1971 the Pritchard Ford Falcon had undergone over 1,200 miles of road tests around Melbourne. In November, Richard Alexander, a consulting engineer employed by US oil and gas company Pancoastal Inc., spent 10 days performing extensive testing of the car and produced a positive report back to the company. Encouraging emission results from the Scientific Services Department of the Gas and Fuel Corporation of Victoria were also reported. Pancoastal had already put down a $20,000 option payment for the possibility of producing the engine in the United States, and other experts from the US and Japan had visited the Caulfield workshop. Pritchard Steam Power received a boost on 6 March 1972 when it signed contracts with Pancoastal PXP that provided an immediate $130,000 to continue development, and a third of the royalties on all engines sold. Later that month, Richard Alexander gave an extensive outline of the Pritchard Power system for Automobiles at a Public Hearing on Alternatives to the Gasoline-powered Internal Combustion Engine before the Panel on Environmental Science and Technology, United States Senate. In July of that year Edward Pritchard was awarded the Hartnett Award in recognition of his work on steam-driven automobiles by the Society of Automotive Engineers of Australasia at Australia's National Science Centre. In November 1972, Pancoastal organised for Ted Pritchard, Michael Edwards and the Ford Falcon to fly to Thousand Oaks, near Los Angeles, USA Demonstrations were given to news media, to Representatives of State and Federal bodies interested in exhaust emissions, to motor car manufacturers including Ford, General Motors, American Motors, Leyland, Volkswagen, Mercedes-Benz, Nissan, Toyota and Alfa Romeo, and to John Deere, Aerojet Liquid Rocket, Sierra Club and the United Auto Workers Union. In March 1973, Ted Pritchard was married to lifelong partner Marion, who was to become a central figure in Pritchard Steam Power and staunch supporter of Ted's obsession with 'modern steam'. At the end of August, the company moved to much larger premises on Canterbury Rd., Bayswater, and installed a dynamometer for testing purposes. However, further support from Pancoastal failed to materialise when they dropped the option in June, and the project again faced financial difficulties. In November 1973, Ted Pritchard drove the Ford Falcon from Melbourne to Parliament House, Canberra. While in Canberra he gave demonstration rides to eight Federal Ministers and members of parliament, including the Minister for Minerals and Energy, Mr Connor, the ACT Minister, Mr Enderby, and the Environment Minister, Dr Cass, who called for a full study of the steam car. The Ford Falcon was publicly displayed at the Melbourne Motor Show in March 1974, with the public showing considerable interest. In May 1974, Ted took the Ford Falcon to the Ford Company's emission testing facility in Geelong on the invitation of the Society of Automotive Engineers. At first the Ford engineers were bemused by the fact that they could not detect any unburnt hydrocarbon in the tail pipe exhaust and stopped the testing to recalibrate their test rig. After further testing confirmed that the exhaust contained no unburnt hydrocarbons at the tail pipe it was declared that the car passed with \\"flying colours\\", with total emissions capable of meeting Euro 2 standards that were not introduced until 25 years later in 1999. However, at the time Eric Lange, chief engineer of Ford Australia said there was \\"little prospect of Ford developing the engine.\\" At this time, the Pritchard company already had designs for a new more advanced power unit (similar in principal to that in the Ford Falcon but promising much better performance) and a body specifically designed for the new power unit. == The Pritchard Steam Company == Advanced Pritchard steam-powered car displayed in March 1975 at the Melbourne International Motor Show A sleek green scale model of the new Pritchard car design was put on public show in March 1975 at the Melbourne International Motor Show. In April, Senator James McClelland, Minister for Manufacturing Industry, announced that the Australian Government would provide funds equivalent to $250,000 for the manufacture of three prototype engines for Pritchard at its ordnance factory in Bendigo. The agreement was signed on 7 July 1975, with Pritchard Power providing the designs and testing of the manufactured power plants. However, the first of the three engines was not delivered until 18 August 1977, leaving the Pritchard company struggling for money to continue development in the interim. While they waited for engines to be delivered, the specially-designed modern Pritchard car – based on Holden Torana running gear – was being constructed in Oakleigh, Victoria. In an October interview with Mr. Pritchard he explained, \\"We need about $80,000 to keep going for the two years it will take to get into production… we have had some inquiries from the Russian Trade Department.\\" In October, Ted put the original Pritchard steam truck up for sale in an effort to raise funds. He was also looking at possible funding from the USSR or the State of California, USA, for a working Pritchard steam engine. By December, the prospects were looking grim, \\"The money runs out next February and, when that happens, the whole thing ends.\\" While politicians, including the Minister for Productivity, Mr MacPhee, Federal Member for Bendigo, Mr John Bourchier, and Federal Member for Latrobe, Mr Marshall Baillieu, continued to show interest in the Pritchard steam project early in 1977, the Pritchard company was putting all their effort into being one of the 32 new cars at the March 1977 Melbourne International Motor Show, at which they collected a 7,000 person signed petition supporting the development of a steam car. A letter supporting the development had also been sent to the Federal Government by Queensland sugar cane farmers, who saw benefit in the production of alcohol to run future steam-powered cars. However, by April the company was in debt and looking at bankruptcy. On 26 April 1977 the Member for Dawson, Mr. Braithwaite, spoke in the Australian House of Representatives on saving the project. Likewise a petition by a number of eminent engineers was also presented to the Government. In June 1977, six State MPs were taken for a ride in the Ford Falcon Pritchard car, and announced that the State Government would back Pritchard with $60,000 grant providing the Federal Government contributed $132,000 to the project. At the same time Mr Pritchard was considering a tender to the State Government of California for AU$325,000 in research funds. However, on 1 July 1977, the Commonwealth Government announced they would collaborate with the Government of Victoria and together provide a grant of AU$150,000 to the Pritchard company. The agreement between the company and the governments was signed in October 1977, and in November, with increased staff, the Pritchard company began preparing for dynamometer testing of the first engine that had been delivered from the Government's Bendigo ordnance factory in August. This step signified that the advanced V twin engine could be manufactured by a third-party, and represented a move towards large-scale production. Work on completing the car unit with controls and instruments also continued in earnest. However, Marion Pritchard noted, \\"The first cheque did not arrive until October and if a lady (anonymous) had not shown a great deal of faith in our project and invested some money, we would not have been here to receive the first cheque.\\" By April 1978, the project was running three to four months behind schedule and the additional costs were eating away at the government grant. Two technical staff employed for the testing had to be dropped. The new engine was tested on the dynamometer for the equivalent of 500 road miles producing some good results, but a major hold-up required the dismantling of the engine, the replacement of parts and its re-assembly, putting the project further behind schedule. There were repeated domestic and international signs of interest in the engine for marine and stationary use, but there were no funds available to pursue these possibilities. \\"An American university, which calls the machine 'the most advanced steam device we know of,' has asked for straw-alcohol-fuelled prototypes, for testing in Third World countries. But tragically, the tiny Australian firm can't deliver. It has no funds to complete its testing program – let alone make engines for sale.\\" The Queensland Sugar Producers Association approached the Federal Government for tax breaks in funding the company, but were rebuffed. The government grant funds ran out in April 1979, and the Federal government refused to consider any further funding. 'According to Mrs. Pritchard \\"There is great pressure from vested interests.\\"' The company attempted to become public in late 1979, but only 42,000 of the 500,000 AU$1 shares offered were taken up. In May 1980, the case of the Pritchard steam car was again taken up by a politician, this time Mr. Vince Lester from the National Party, Member for Peak Downs in Queensland. He pointed to the use of blended liquid from powdered coal and alcohol from sugar cane as two State resources that could benefit from the development of the steam car. However, in June 1980, Mr. Pritchard put his Ford Falcon and the contents of his workshop in Bayswater up for auction. The company had received interest in Pritchard steam engines from both Indonesia and Papua New Guinea, but had been unable to find investors interested in funding the projects. In late June 1980, Vince Lester set up a cross-party public appeal with Dr Lockwood (Liberal Party, Toowoomba North) and Mr Wright (Australian Labor Party, Rockhampton) to raise money to stop the Pritchard auction. Mr Lester, who had visited Mr. Pritchard's Bayswater factory in April said, \\"I believe that if Pritchard is forced to sell, then the major oil companies will buy. They have no wish to allow development of a fuel alternative to petrol.\\" By July, Queenslanders had donated $100,000 to keep the steam project alive, and a Sunshine Coast engineering firm had offered $250,000 to have the steam engine developed in Queensland. \\"[An] $80,000 was made available to Pritchard Steam Pty Ltd as an interest-free loan for three years to meet pressing creditors. Unfortunately, by early 1981 the results of the public appeal had gone sour, and action was taken to recover the $80,000 loan. With no further hope of funding, and with mounting debts himself, Ted Pritchard was finally forced to close Pritchard Steam Power. Ted found work as a lecturer at RMIT teaching, among other things, the principles of mechanical engineering and the finer points of thermodynamics. This position allowed him to continue researching efficient forms of modern steam power, and to remind his students that the perfect working fluid is still water. == The S5000 == In 1997, Ted Pritchard made a submission to the Inquiry into Urban Air Pollution in Australia, again promoting the low emissions possible from modern steam power plants. From 1999 to 2002 he maintained a Pritchard Power website, on which he began to publish new articles about steam power. Now in his late 60s, Ted Pritchard declared that he would \\"draw one last engine before I die\\", and after about 6,000 hours over five years he formulated, designed and drew in pencil and ink every last nut, bolt and screw of a new Pritchard engine. This engine, known as the S5000 (steam five thousand watts), was designed to burn low-grade fuel and produce electricity, but is also be able to provide steam and heat, distil water or drive any rotary mechanical device using a belt. When he finished the drawings for the S5000, Pritchard declared that he had finally done for steam engines what IBM did for computers, \\"made them small and personal\\", – reducing them in scale and increasing their power-to-weight ratio to the point where they could become commonly available and useful technology. In 2003, Pritchard Power Australia Pty Ltd (PPA) was formed exclusively to develop and license unique high efficiency, small-scale steam power systems designed by Ted Pritchard. Ted had some of the patterns and moulds for key components of the S5000 made up, however, he never saw his final design become a reality. Ted Pritchard died at Caritas Christi Hospice in Kew, Melbourne on 16 August 2007 after a long illness. At the time the first prototype of the S5000 was being made by a Gillion Group subsidiary, MTN Tooling in Bentleigh under an agreement with a new company Ted had formed in 2006, Pritchard Power Systems Ltd. This company eventually became Uniflow Power Ltd that has proceeded to secure wide-ranging global patents over aspects of the core technology that Ted designed. Uniflow has developed the S5000 to the point that it is being demonstrated as a pre- commercial prototype known as the 'Cobber'. == References == Category:Australian mechanical engineers Category:Australian inventors Category:1930 births Category:2007 deaths Category:People from Melbourne Category:RMIT University alumni Category:20th-century inventors ","title":"Edward Pritchard (engineer)"},{"id":"54112014","text":"Antone's was a record label based in Austin, Texas. ==History== Antone's Records & Tapes was founded by Clifford Antone (October 27, 1949 – May 22, 2006) in 1987, and it was specialized in blues music, particularly blues artists who performed at his in 1975 opened blues nightclub Antone's in Austin, Texas.

His parents emigrated to the United States when he was two years old and settled in Boston's Roxbury neighborhood. At the age of 20, Stopford moved to Beverly to attend private school. ==Military career== At the age of fifteen, Stopford attempted to enlist in a Hundred Days regiment, but was rejected due to his youth and small size. In 1865 he joined the Co D. Roxbury house guards. In 1875 he joined the 2nd corps of cadets of Salem as a private. He served in this command until 1885. After one year out of the militia he reenlisted. In 1888 he was discharged from the Salem cadets and was promoted to second lieutenant in Co E., the Beverly company of the 8th regiment. By the time the Spanish–American War broke out, Stopford was the senior major of the regiment and was mustered into the United States Army and promoted to Lieutenant Colonel. The 8th regiment was not given a combat detail and after the war, Stopford returned to his old position as major of the 8th regiment. In 1905, Stopford was appointed Adjutant General of Massachusetts by Governor William Lewis Douglas. According to The Boston Daily Globe, his appointment was said to be due to the influence of his friend John J. Flaherty, a captain in the 8th regiment and chairman of the executive committee of the Massachusetts Democratic Party. Stopford retired from the militia on January 4, 1906 as a Major General. ==Business career== After moving to Beverly, Stopford worked in the wholesale and retail fishing business. He had stores in Salem, Beverly, and Peabody and a plant in Port Clyde, Maine. ==Political career== Stopford was a member of the Democratic Party. In 1890, Stopford was a candidate for the Massachusetts Senate in the 2nd Essex district. He gained the support of many Republicans and was able to win the election. The Republicans united behind William Edwin Meade the following year and Stopford was defeated 3,701 votes to 3,193. He was a member of Beverly's last board of selectmen before Beverly adopted a city government in 1895. Stopford ran for the 19th Essex Massachusetts House of Representatives seat in 1896. He finished fourth in a district in which the top two vote getters were elected. In 1924, Stopford was elected Mayor of Beverly. He was reelected in 1926, but he resigned on February 6, 1928 at the recommendation of his physician. During his tenure as Mayor, the city's bond indebtedness decreased and the McKay School was built. Stoppford died on September 11, 1928 at his home in Beverly. ==References== Category:1848 births Category:1928 deaths Category:19th-century American politicians Category:20th- century American politicians Category:Adjutants General of Massachusetts Category:English emigrants to the United States Category:Massachusetts Democrats Category:Massachusetts state senators Category:Mayors of Beverly, Massachusetts Category:People from Boston Category:Politicians from Manchester ","title":"William Stopford"},{"id":"54112090","text":"Raden Kodijat is recipient of the 1961 Ramon Magsaysay Award for his dedicated and skillful direction of the massive yaws eradication effort that is freeing his countrymen from a disfiguring and crippling disease.http://www.rmaward.asia/awardees/kodijat-raden/ ==References== Category:Indonesian public health doctors Category:Ramon Magsaysay Award winners Category:1890 births Category:Year of death missing ","title":"Raden Kodijat"},{"id":"54112112","text":"On 22 May 2017, an Islamist extremist suicide bomber detonated a shrapnel- laden homemade bomb as people were leaving the Manchester Arena following a concert by US singer Ariana Grande. Twenty-three people died, including the attacker, and more than 800 were wounded, some of them children. Several hundred more suffered psychological trauma. The bomber was Salman Ramadan Abedi, a 22-year-old local man of Libyan ancestry. After initial suspicions of a terrorist network, police later said they believed Abedi had largely acted alone but that others had been aware of his plans. In March 2020, the bomber's brother, Hashem Abedi, was found guilty of 22 counts of murder in relation to the attack. The incident was the deadliest terrorist attack and the first suicide bombing in the United Kingdom since the 7 July 2005 London bombings. ==Attack== On 22 May 2017 at 22:31 BST (UTC+01:00), a suicide bomber detonated an improvised explosive device, packed with nuts and bolts to act as shrapnel, in the foyer area of the Manchester Arena. The attack took place after a concert by American pop star Ariana Grande that was part of her Dangerous Woman Tour. 14,200 people attended the concert. Many exiting concert-goers and waiting parents were in the foyer at the time of the explosion. According to evidence presented at the coroner's inquest, the bomb was strong enough to kill people up to away. Greater Manchester Police declared the incident a terrorist attack and suicide bombing. It was the deadliest attack in the United Kingdom since the 7 July 2005 London bombings. Aftermath About three hours after the bombing, police conducted a controlled explosion on a suspicious item of clothing in Cathedral Gardens. This was later confirmed to have been abandoned clothing and not dangerous. Residents and taxi companies in Manchester offered free transport or accommodation via Twitter to those left stranded at the concert. Parents were separated from their children attending the concert in the aftermath of the explosion. A nearby hotel served as a shelter for people displaced by the bombing, with officials directing separated parents and children there. Manchester's Sikh temples (gurdwaras) along with local homeowners, hotels and venues offered shelter to survivors of the attack. British military personnel alongside armed police as part of Operation Temperer in response to the raised threat level Manchester Victoria railway station, which is partly underneath the arena, was evacuated and closed, and services were cancelled. The explosion caused structural damage to the station, which remained closed until the damage had been assessed and repaired, resulting in disruption to train and tram services. The station reopened to traffic eight days later, following the completion of police investigation work and repairs to the fabric of the building. After a COBRA meeting with Greater Manchester's Chief Constable, Ian Hopkins, on 23 May, Prime Minister Theresa May announced that the UK's terror threat level Threat levels in Great Britain and in Northern Ireland from international and Northern Ireland-related terrorism, published here, are deemed \\"critical\\" for a period following the attack. was raised to \\"critical\\", its highest level. The threat level remained critical until 27 May, when it was reduced to its previous level of severe. In the aftermath of the attack Operation Temperer was activated for the first time, allowing up to 5,000 soldiers to reinforce armed police in protecting parts of the country. Tours of the Houses of Parliament and the Changing of the Guard ceremony at Buckingham Palace were cancelled on 24 May, and troops were deployed to guard government buildings in London. On 23 May, the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, via the Nashir Telegram channel, claimed the attack was carried out by \\"a soldier of the Khilafah\\". The message called the attack \\"an endeavor to terrorize the mushrikin, and in response to their transgressions against the lands of the Muslims.\\" Abedi's sister said that he was motivated by revenge for Muslim children killed by American airstrikes in Syria. Manchester Arena foyer, after renovation The Arena remained closed until September 2017, with scheduled concerts either cancelled or moved to other venues. It reopened on 9 September, with a benefit concert featuring Noel Gallagher and other acts associated with North West England. May announced an extra £13 million reimbursement from central government to Manchester's public services for most of the costs incurred by the attack in January 2018. Later that month, Chris Parker, a homeless man who stole from victims of the attack, was jailed for 4 years and three months. ==Casualties== The explosion killed the attacker and 22 concert-goers and parents who were in the entrance waiting to pick up their children following the show; 119 people were initially reported as injured. This number was revised by police to 250 on 22 June, with the addition of severe psychological trauma and minor injuries. In May 2018, the number of injured was revised to 800. The dead included ten people aged under 20; the youngest victim was an eight-year-old girl and the oldest was a 51-year-old woman. Of the 22 victims, twenty were Britons and two were British-based Polish nationals. North West Ambulance Service reported that 60 of its ambulances attended the scene, carried 59 people to local hospitals, and treated walking wounded on site. Of those hospitalised, 12 were children under the age of 16. In total, 112 people were hospitalized for their injuries, and 27 were treated for injuries that did not require hospitalization. Out of this total of 139, 79 were children. The first doctor thought to have been on scene was an off-duty consultant anaesthetist, Michael Daley. In recognition of his bravery for the role he played in the immediate medical response to the incident, Daley's name was entered into the British Medical Association Book of Valour in June 2017. ==Attacker== The bomber, Salman Ramadan Abedi, was a 22-year-old British Muslim of Libyan ancestry. He was born in Manchester to a Salafi family of Libyan-born refugees who had settled in south Manchester after fleeing to the UK to escape the government of Muammar Gaddafi. He had two brothers and a sister. He grew up in the Whalley Range area and lived in Fallowfield. Neighbours described the Abedi family as very traditional and \\"super religious\\".Connor, Richard (25 May 2017). Manchester bomber: A life on the move. Deutsche Welle. Retrieved 26 May 2017. Abedi, his elder brother, and, prior to 2011, his father attended Didsbury Mosque. Abedi attended Wellacre Technology College, Burnage Academy for Boys and The Manchester College. A former tutor remarked that Abedi was \\"a very slow, uneducated and passive person\\". According to The Times, Abedi had been among a group of students at his high school who had accused a teacher of Islamophobia for asking them what they thought of suicide bombers. He also reportedly said to his friends that being a suicide bomber \\"was ok\\" and fellow college students raised concerns about his behaviour. Abedi's father was a member of the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group, a Salafi jihadist organisation proscribed by the United Nations, and father and son fought for the group in Libya in 2011 as part of the movement to overthrow Muammar Gaddafi.Salman Abedi: from hot- headed party lover to suicide bomber.

An imam at Didsbury mosque recalled that Abedi looked at him \\"with hate\\" after he preached against ISIS and Ansar al-Sharia in 2015. Abedi's sister claimed her brother was motivated by the injustice of Muslim children dying in bombings stemming from the American-led intervention in the Syrian Civil War. A family friend of the Abedi's also remarked that Salman had vowed revenge at the funeral of Abdul Wahab Hafidah, who was run over and stabbed to death by a Manchester gang in 2016 and was a friend of Salman and his younger brother Hashem. Hashem later co-ordinated the Manchester bombing with his brother.Sister reveals motives of Manchester massacre monster. New Zealand Herald (25 May 2017).

According to an acquaintance in the UK, Abedi was \\"outgoing\\" and consumed alcohol, while another said that Abedi was a \\"regular kid who went out and drank\\" until about 2016. Abedi was also known to have used cannabis. He enrolled at the University of Salford in September 2014, where he studied business administration, before dropping out to work in a bakery. Manchester police believe Abedi used student loans to finance the plot, including travel overseas to learn bomb-making. The Guardian reported that despite dropping out from further education, he was still receiving student loan funding in April 2017. Abedi returned to Manchester on 18 May after a trip to Libya and bought bomb-making material, apparently constructing the acetone peroxide-based bomb by himself. It is known that many members of the ISIS Battar brigade trained people in bomb-making in Libya. He was known to British security services and police but was not regarded as a high risk, having been linked to petty crime but never flagged up for radical views. A community worker told the BBC he had called a hotline five years before the bombing to warn police about Abedi's views and members of Britain's Libyan diaspora said they had \\"warned authorities for years\\" about Manchester's Islamist radicalisation. Abedi was allegedly reported to authorities for his extremism by five community leaders and family members and had been banned from a mosque; the Chief Constable of Greater Manchester, however, said Abedi was not known to the Prevent anti-radicalisation programme. On 29 May 2017, MI5 launched an internal inquiry into its handling of the warnings it had received about Abedi and a second, \\"more in depth\\" inquiry, into how it missed the danger. The Daily Mail reported that MI5 had a policy of allowing Libyans in the UK to travel to fight against Gaddafi and return later, including some who had been under house arrest in the UK for counter-terrorist measures.Curtis, Mark (5 April 2018). What will be the blowback for UK government after Libya revelations?. Middle East Eye. Retrieved 26 October 2018. On 22 November 2018, the Intelligence and Security Committee of Parliament published a report which said that MI5 had acted \\"too slowly\\" in its dealings with Abedi. The committee's report noted \\"What we can say is that there were a number of a failings in the handling of Salman Abedi's case. While it is impossible to say whether these would have prevented the devastating attack on 22 May, we have concluded that as a result of the failings, potential opportunities to prevent it were missed.\\" ==Investigation== Bombing location map The property in Fallowfield where Abedi lived was raided on 23 May. Armed police breached the house with a controlled explosion and searched it. Abedi's 23-year-old brother was arrested in Chorlton-cum-Hardy in south Manchester in relation to the attack. Police carried out raids in two other areas of south Manchester and another address in the Whalley Range area. Three other men were arrested, and police initially spoke of a network supporting the bomber; they later announced that Abedi had sourced all the bomb components himself, and that they now believed he had largely acted alone. On 6 July, police said that they believed others had been aware of Abedi's plans. According to German police sources, Abedi transited through Düsseldorf Airport on his way home to Manchester from Istanbul four days before the bombing. French interior minister Gérard Collomb said in an interview with BFM TV that Abedi may have been to Syria, and had \\"proven\\" links with ISIS. Abedi's younger brother and father were arrested by Libyan security forces on 23 and 24 May respectively. The brother was suspected of planning an attack in Libya, and was said to be in regular touch with Salman, and aware of the plan to bomb the Manchester Arena, but not the date. According to a Libyan official, the brothers spoke on the phone about 15 minutes before the attack was carried out. On 1 November 2017, the UK requested Libya to extradite the bomber's younger brother, Hashem Abedi to return to the UK to face trial for complicity in the murder of the 22 people killed in the explosion. Photographs of the remains of the IED published by The New York Times indicated that it had comprised an explosive charge inside a lightweight metal container which was carried within a black vest or a blue Karrimor backpack. Most of the fatalities occurred in a ring around the bomber. His torso was propelled by the blast through the doors to the arena, possibly indicating that the explosive charge was held in the backpack and blew him forward on detonation. A small device thought to have possibly been a hand-held detonator was also found. US Congressman Michael McCaul, chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, indicated that the bomb contained the explosive TATP, which has been used in previous bombings. According to Manchester police, the explosive device used by Abedi was the design of a skilled bomb-maker and had a back-up means of detonation. Police also said Salman Abedi \\"bought most of Manchester bomb components himself\\" and that he was alone during much of the time before carrying out the Manchester bombing. On 28 May, police released images showing Abedi on the night of the bombing, taken from CCTV footage. Further images showed Abedi walking around Manchester with a blue suitcase. According to US intelligence sources, Abedi was identified by the bank card that he had with him and the identification confirmed using facial recognition technology. A total of 22 people were arrested in connection with the attack, but had all been released without charge by 11 June following the police's conclusion that Abedi was likely to have acted alone, even though others may have been aware of his plans. News leaks Within hours of the attack, Abedi's name and other information given confidentially to security services in the United States and France were leaked to the news media, leading to condemnation from Home Secretary Amber Rudd. Following the publication of crime scene photographs of the backpack bomb used in the attack in the 24 May edition of The New York Times, UK counterterrorism police chiefs said the release of the material was detrimental to the investigation. On 25 May, Greater Manchester Police said it had stopped sharing information on the attack with the US intelligence services. May said she would make clear to President Trump that \\"intelligence that has been shared must be made secure.\\" Trump described the leaks to the news media as \\"deeply troubling\\", and pledged to carry out a full investigation. British officials blamed the leaks on \\"the breakdown of normal discipline at the White House and in the US security services\\". New York Times editor Dean Baquet declined to apologise for publishing the backpack bomb photographs, saying \\"We live in different press worlds\\" and that the material was not classified at the highest level. On 26 May, US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said the United States government accepted responsibility for the leaks.  Links with the Muslim Brotherhood  According to a secret recording unveiled by the BBC, Mostafa Graf, the imam of the Didsbury Mosque where Salman Abedi and his family were regulars, made a call for armed jihad 10 days before Abedi bought his concert ticket. Following these revelations, the Manchester Police opened an investigation into the mosque and its Imam, who also fought with a Libyan Islamist militia. Mostafa Graf is a member of the International Union of Muslim Scholars, an organisation founded by the Muslim Brotherhood and Yusuf al-Qaradawi. Al-Qaradawi is known for having claimed, \\"Suicide bombings are a duty\\". Haras Rafiq, head of the Quilliam think tank, told The Guardian that the Muslim Brotherhood runs the Didsbury Mosque. The Didsbury Mosque is controlled by The Islamic Centre (Manchester), an English association headed by Dr. Haytham al-Khaffaf, who is also a director of the Human Relief Foundation, a Muslim Brotherhood organisation blacklisted for terrorism by Israel. Between 2015 and 2016, al-Khaffaf's Human Relief Foundation received over £1.5 million from the Qatar Charity, which is also subject of US counterterrorism surveillance. Trial and sentencing of Hashem Abedi On 17 July 2019, Salman Abedi's brother Hashem was charged with murder, attempted murder and conspiracy to cause an explosion. He had been arrested in Libya and extradited to the UK. His trial began on 5 February 2020. On 17 March, Hashem Abedi was found guilty on 22 charges of murder, on the grounds that he had helped his brother to source the materials used in the bombing and had assisted with the manufacture of the explosives which were used in the attack. On 20 August, Hashem Abedi was sentenced to a minimum of 55 years in prison. The judge, Mr Justice Jeremy Baker, said that sentencing rules prevented him from imposing a whole life order as Abedi had been 20 years old at the time of the offence. The minimum age for a whole life order is 21 years old. Abedi's sentence of 55 years is the longest minimum term ever given by a British court. ==Reactions== United Kingdom St Ann's Square in Manchester city centre Theresa May condemned the bombing, and in a later statement following the 2017 London Bridge attack, she said these attacks, along with the 2017 Westminster attack, were \\"bound together by the single evil ideology of Islamist extremism\\" and said this extremism was \\"a perversion of Islam\\". Queen Elizabeth II expressed her sympathy to the families of the victims. Campaigning for the upcoming general election was suspended by all political parties for two days after the attack. The Mayor of Greater Manchester, Andy Burnham, called the attack \\"evil\\" and announced a vigil in Albert Square the following evening, which thousands attended.Manchester Mayor: Bomber Was A Terrorist, Not A Muslim , lbc.co.uk, 24 May 2017 The Muslim Council of Britain also condemned the attack. On 25 May 2017, a national minute's silence was observed to remember the victims. Police reported a 500% increase in anti-Muslim hate crimes in the Greater Manchester area in the month following the attack. The Commission for Countering Extremism was created in the aftermath of the bombing. International Condolences were expressed by the leaders and governments of dozens of countries, United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres, Commonwealth Secretary-General Patricia Scotland, President of the European Commission Jean-Claude Juncker, Pope Francis, and secretary general of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation Yousef Al-Othaimeen.

The report was \\"an independent review into the preparedness for, and emergency response to, the Manchester Arena attack on 22nd May 2017.\\" In the report, Kerslake \\"largely praised\\" the Greater Manchester Police and British Transport Police, and noted that it was \\"fortuitous\\" that the North West Ambulance Service was unaware of the declaration of Operation Plato, a protocol under which all responders should have withdrawn from the arena in case of an active killer on the premises. However, it found that the Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service was \\"brought to a point of paralysis\\" as their response was delayed for two hours due to poor communication between the firefighters' liaison officer and the police force. The report was critical of Vodafone for the \\"catastrophic failure\\" of an emergency helpline hosted on a platform provided by Content Guru, saying that delays in getting information caused \\"significant stress and upset\\" to families. It also expressed criticism of some news media, saying, \\"To have experienced such intrusive and overbearing behaviour at a time of such enormous vulnerability seemed to us to be completely and utterly unacceptable\\", but noting that, \\"We recognise that this was some, but by no means all of the media and that the media also have a positive and important role to play.\\" ==See also== * List of terrorist incidents in Great Britain * List of terrorist incidents in May 2017 ==ReferencesExternal links== *Manchester attack: Who were the victims?

Cytotrienin A (Cyt A) is a secondary metabolite isolated from Streptomyces sp. RK95-74 isolated from soil in Japan in 1997.Kakeya, H.; Zhang, H.; Kobinata, K.; Onose, R.; Onozawa, C.; Kudo, T.; Osada, H. \\"Cytotrienin A, a Novel Apoptosis Inducer in Human Leukemia HL-60 cells.\\".

Angew. Chem. 2008. 47, 6657-6600. Cyt A is an ansamycin. Cytotrienin A induces apoptosis on HL-60 cells, as well as inhibiting translation in eukaryotes by inhibiting eukaryotic elongation factor 1A (eEF1A), which can act as an oncogene.Lindqvist, L.; Robert, F.; Merrick, W.; Kakeya, H.; Fraser, C.; Osada, H.; Pelletier, J. “Inhibition of translation by cytotrienin A—a member of the ansamycin family”. RNA. 2010. 16. 2404-2413. These functions lead to the potential of the microbial metabolite acting as an anticancer agent, specifically for blood cancers, as it has proved to be more effective with leukemic cell lines. Cyt A is thought to induce apoptosis by activating c-Jun N-terminal Kinase (JNK), p38 mitogen- activated protein kinase (MAPK), and p36 myelin basic protein (MBP) kinase.Watabe, M.; Kakeya, H.; Onose, R.; Osada, H. \\"Activation of MST/Krs and c-Jun N-terminal Kinases by Different Signaling Pathways during Cytotrienin A-induced Apoptosis\\". J. Biol. Chem. 2000. 275. 8766-8771. == Structure == Cytotrienin A is an ansamycin with a macrocyclic, twenty-one carbon, lactam, featuring an E,E,E-triene and an unusual aminocyclopropane carboxylic acid side chain. The structure features four stereocenters, 3 of which are contiguous. The absolute stereochemistry of the naturally occurring metabolite revealed it to be (+)-Cytotrienin A. == Biology and Biochemistry == Cytotrienin A has a median effective dose value of 7.7 nM to induce apoptosis on HL-60 cells. It was also shown that the metabolite has greater growth inhibitory activity on HL-60 cells at low concentrations and little impact on non-tumorous cells, while at high concentrations the reverse relationship was seen. The apoptosis pathway was shown to involve the proteolytic activation of MST/Krs proteins by caspase-3 which results in the activation of p36 MBP kinase through the creation of ROS. The concentrations needed to induce this pathway were found to be the same required to induce apoptosis on HL-60 cells.Kakeya, H.; Onose, R.; Osada, H. \\"Caspase-mediated activation of a 36-kDa myelin basic protein kinase during anticancer drug-induced apoptosis\\". Cancer Res. 1998. 58. 4888-4894. Cyt A also activates c-Jun N-terminal kinase, and its apoptotic effects are inhibited by dominant negative c-Jun. While the presence of inactive MST/Krs proteins and dominant negative c-Jun completely inhibited apoptosis. Additionally, cytotrienin A acts to inhibit eEF-1A, and thus inhibiting translation. This can make the tumor less effective at producing anti-apoptotic mediators and lowering the tumor's drug resistance. The translation inhibition is thought to occur before apoptosis can be detected. Inhibition of HUVEC tube formation was also shown, which indicates an inhibition of angiogenesis and further evidence of its anti-cancer potential. In A549 cells, where cytotrienin A has been shown to be less effective, cyt A inhibits the expression of ICAM-1. This occurs when the TNF receptor 1 is shredded through the activation of extracellular signal- regulated kinase (ERK) and p38 MAPK.Yamda, Y.; Taketani, S.; Osada, H.; Kataoka, T. \\"Cytotrienin A, a translation inhibitor that induces ectodomain shredding of TNF receptor 1 via activation of ERK and p38 MAP kinase\\". Eur J Pharmacol. 2011. 667. 113-119. Cyt A inhibited ICAM-1 expression by TNF-α and IL-1α at similar concentrations, but was found to be inhibited by TAPI-2, an inhibitor to the TNF-α-converting enzyme (TACE). ==References== Category:Streptomyces Category:Heterocyclic compounds (4 or more rings) Category:Lactams Category:Cyclopropanes ","title":"Cytotrienin A"},{"id":"54112140","text":"Twin Falls is a waterfall located in the Silver Falls State Park at the east end of the city of Salem, in Marion County, in the U.S. state of Oregon.

It is also published in France by Soleil, in Poland by Waneko, and in Taiwan by Kadokawa Taiwan Corporation. ==Plot== On her 16th birthday, the orphan Momochi Himari, unexpectedly receives the old Momochi family estate as inheritance. Despite the warnings she received about the house being haunted, having no other place to go, she decides to move there anyway. Upon her arrival she discovers that the house is occupied illegally by three handsome young men: Aoi, Yukari and Ise. The three immediately warn the unaware Himari that she must leave the house as soon as possible, using the story of the ghosts and curses as well, but she does not give up. Soon, she discovers that it is all true: her home appears to be on the border between the human and the spirit worlds, and she was destined to be the guardian between the two, but her role is already taken by Aoi. ==Characters== ; :It has been stated in the manga that Himari's parents passed away, most likely when she was very young and has been an orphan ever since. It is unclear if she has any siblings before the incident or how her parents passed on. By having the blood of the Momochi family running in her veins, she is supposed to be the next Omamori-sama or, 'Nue', the guardian of the Momochi House when she receives the will of her family when she turns 16. This would make her the guardian of the Momochi House which is located on the border of the human and spirit world, which would fall under the guardian's protection and monitoring, However, that role has been taken by Aoi and now, she only holds the power to expel anyone from the house if she wishes hard enough due to her bloodline. ; : :He is human, but he became the Omamori-sama at the age of 10 while trying to run away from something, he broke the seal and entered in the Momochi house, this forced him to become its guardian. The house has erased all the traces of his existence in the human world, which is why it seems that neither his family nor friends remember him. In the Nue form, he is a spirit with cat ears, bird feathers and foxtail. ; :He is Aoi's first shikigami, a serving spirit, in his demonic form he has the appearance of a Mizuchi, a water snake. In his past life he was human, wrongly accused of being a demon, given as a sacrifice to the dragon god Ryujin, the god took pity on him and allowed him to be reborn as an Ayakashi of his own species. He is very kind and does all the houseworks. ; :He is Aoi's second shikigami, in his demonic form he has the appearance of a Shōjō, an orangutan. He is the youngest of his species, for breaking the law by releasing his powers to the human world, the elders of his tribe fitted him with a cursed collar and warned him if he broke the law again, the curse would destroy his body. In order to save a friend, he ended up breaking the law so Aoi made Ise his shikigami to dissolve the curse and save him. Before arriving at the Momochi house, he enjoyed observing humans and sometimes playing pranks on them. Unlike Yukari, he is very grumpy. ; :He is a gatekeeper in the spirit realm, he aspired to become the new Omamori- sama, but the Nue, to keep him at bay, forced him to become one of his shikigami. He too, in his past life, was human. ; :A powerful Ayakashi, he has a deep obsession towards the Nue, and is his biggest rival. To fight boredom, he enjoys annoying the members of the Momochi household, and his arrival usually announces big troubles. ; :A childhood friend of Aoi who still has some fragments of his memories with him. He is the descendant of a family that had the power to control the Kuda-gitsune, a fox-like spirit, although he demonstrated that he did not inherit this ability, he still has some connection with the spirit world. ==ReleaseReception== Rebecca Silverman from Anime News Network said that the artwork is similar to that of Kamisama Kiss and Natsume's Book of Friends, but admitted that Aya's art has become more refined compared to before. She pointed out that the manga is easy to read and the story development is interesting because it leaves some questions in readers' minds. In a review of the first volume, Kate O’Neil of Fandom Post wrote that she didn't see anything new in the manga, but praised the author for its colour artwork. She also said that it looks to her like a blend of many shōjo manga.

In stability theory, Spectral Factorization has been used to find determinental matrix representations for bivariate stable polynomials and real zero polynomials. A key tool used to study these is a matrix factorization known as either the Polynomial Matrix Spectral Factorization or the Matrix Fejer–Riesz Theorem. Given a univariate positive polynomial p(t), a polynomial which takes on non-negative values for any real input t, the Fejer–Riesz Theorem yields the polynomial spectral factorization p(t) = q(t) q(\\\\bar{t})^*. Results of this form are generically referred to as Positivstellensatz. Considering positive definiteness as the matrix analogue of positivity, Polynomial Matrix Spectral Factorization provides a similar factorization for polynomial matrices which have positive definite range. This decomposition also relates to the Cholesky decomposition for scalar matrices A =LL^* . This result was originally proven by Wiener in a more general context which was concerned with integrable matrix-valued functions that also had integrable log determinant. Because applications are often concerned with the polynomial restriction, simpler proofs and individual analysis exist focusing on this case. Weaker positivstellensatz conditions have been studied, specifically considering when the polynomial matrix has positive definite image on semi-algebraic subsets of the reals. Many publications recently have focused on streamlining proofs for these related results. This article roughly follows the recent proof method of Lasha Ephremidze which relies only on elementary linear algebra and complex analysis. Spectral Factorization is used extensively in linear–quadratic–Gaussian control. Because of this application there have been many algorithms to calculate spectral factors. Some modern algorithms focus on the more general setting originally studied by Wiener. In the 1 \\\\times 1 case the problem is known as polynomial spectral factorization, or Fejer-Riesz Theorem, and has many classical algorithms. Some modern algorithms have used Toeplitz matrix advances to speed up factor calculations. == Statement == Let P(t) = \\\\begin{bmatrix}p_{11}(t) &\\\\ldots &p;_{1n}(t) \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\vdots & \\\\ddots & \\\\vdots\\\\\\\\\\\\ p_{n1}(t) & \\\\cdots& p_{nn}(t)\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{bmatrix}be a polynomial matrix where each entry p_{ij}(t) is a complex coefficient polynomial of degree at most N.

For t \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R} we haveP(t) = Q(t) Q(t)^* = Q(t)Q(\\\\bar{t})^* This because of the following observation: Since the entries of Q(t) Q(\\\\bar{t})^* and P(t) are complex polynomials which agree on the real line, they are in fact the same polynomials. We can conclude they in fact agree for all complex inputs. == Rational spectral factorization == Let p(t) be a rational polynomial function where p(t) > 0 for almost all t \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}. Then there exists rational q(t) with p(t) = q(t) q(\\\\bar{t})^* where q(t) has no poles or zeroes in the lower half plane. This decomposition is unique up to multiplication by complex scalars of norm 1. This is related to the statement of the Polynomial Matrix Spectral Factorization theorem restricted to the 1 \\\\times 1 case. To prove existence write p(x) = c \\\\frac{\\\\prod_i (x- \\\\alpha_i)}{\\\\prod_j (x-\\\\beta_j)}where \\\\alpha_i eq \\\\beta_j. Letting x \\\\to \\\\infty, we can conclude that c is real and positive. Dividing out by \\\\sqrt{c} we reduce to the monic case. The numerator and denominator have distinct sets of roots, so all real roots which show up in either must have even multiplicity (to prevent a sign change locally). We can divide out these real roots to reduce to the case where p(t) has only complex roots and poles. By hypothesis we have p(x) = \\\\frac{\\\\prod_i (x- \\\\alpha_i)}{\\\\prod_j (x-\\\\beta_j)} = \\\\frac{\\\\prod_i (x- \\\\bar{\\\\alpha_i})}{\\\\prod_j (x-\\\\bar{\\\\beta_j})} = \\\\bar{p(\\\\bar{x})}. Since all of the \\\\alpha_i, \\\\beta_jare complex (and hence not fixed points of conjugation) they both come in conjugate pairs. For each conjugate pair, pick the zero or pole in the upper half plane and accumulate these to obtain q(t). The uniqueness result follows in a standard fashion. == Cholesky decomposition == The inspiration for this result is a factorization which characterizes positive definite matrices.  Decomposition for scalar matrices  Given any positive definite scalar matrix A, the Cholesky decomposition allows us to write A = LL^* where L is a lower triangular matrix. If we don't restrict to lower triangular matrices we can consider all factorizations of the form A = V V^*. It is not hard to check that all factorizations are achieved by looking at the orbit of L under right multiplication by a unitary matrix, V = L U. To obtain the lower triangular decomposition we induct by splitting off the first row and first column:\\\\begin{bmatrix} a_{11} & \\\\mathbf{a}_{12}^* \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\mathbf{a}_{12} & A_{22} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{bmatrix} = \\\\begin{bmatrix} l_{11} & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\mathbf{l}_{21} & L_{22} \\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\begin{bmatrix} l_{11}^* & \\\\mathbf{l}_{21}^* \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & L_{22}^* \\\\end{bmatrix} = \\\\begin{bmatrix} l_{11} l_{11}^* & l_{11} \\\\mathbf{l}_{21}^* \\\\\\\\\\\\ l_{11}^* \\\\mathbf{l}_{21} & \\\\mathbf{l}_{21} \\\\mathbf{l}_{21}^*+ L_{22} L_{22}^* \\\\end{bmatrix}Solving these in terms of a_{ij} we getl_{11} = \\\\sqrt{a_{11}} \\\\mathbf{l}_{21} = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{a_{11}}}\\\\mathbf{a}_{12} L_{22} L_{22}^* = A_{22} - \\\\frac{1}{a_{11}} \\\\mathbf{a}_{12} \\\\mathbf{a}^*_{12} Since A is positive definite we have a_{11}is a positive real number, so it has a square root. The last condition from induction since the right hand side is the Schur complement of A, which is itself positive definite.  Decomposition for rational matrices  Now consider P(t) = \\\\begin{bmatrix}p_{11}(t) &\\\\ldots &p;_{1n}(t) \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\vdots & \\\\ddots & \\\\vdots\\\\\\\\\\\\ p_{n1}(t) & \\\\cdots& p_{nn}(t)\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{bmatrix}where the p_{ij}(t)are complex rational functions and P(t) is positive definite hermitian for almost all real t. Then by the symmetric Gaussian elimination we performed above, all we need to show is there exists a rational q_{11}(t) such that p_{11}(t) = q_{11}(t) q_{11}(t)^*for real t, which follows from our rational spectral factorization. Once we have that then we can solve for l_{11}(t), \\\\mathbf{l}_{21}(t). Since the Schur complement is positive definite for the real t away from the poles and the Schur complement is a rational polynomial matrix we can induct to find L_{22}. It is not hard to check that we in fact get P(t) = L(t) L(t)^*where L(t) is a rational polynomial matrix with no poles in the lower half plane. == Extension to polynomial decompositions == To prove the existence of polynomial matrix spectral factorization, we begin with the rational polynomial matrix Cholesky Decomposition and modify it to remove lower half plane singularities. Namely given P(t) = \\\\begin{bmatrix}p_{11}(t) &\\\\ldots &p;_{1n}(t) \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\vdots & \\\\ddots & \\\\vdots\\\\\\\\\\\\ p_{n1}(t) & \\\\cdots& p_{nn}(t)\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{bmatrix}with each entry p_{ij}(t) a complex coefficient polynomial we have rational polynomial matrix L(t) with P(t) = L(t) L(t)^*for real t, where L(t) has no lower half plane poles. Given a rational polynomial matrix U(t) which is unitary valued for real t, there exists another decomposition,P(t) = L(t) L(t)^* = (L(t) U(t)) (L(t) U(t))^*.  Removing lower half-plane singularities  If \\\\det(L(a)) = 0 then there exists a scalar unitary matrix Usuch that U e_1 = \\\\frac{a}{a}. This implies L(t) U has first column vanish at a. To remove the singularity at a we multiply byU(t) = \\\\operatorname{diag}(1, \\\\ldots, \\\\frac{z - \\\\bar{a}}{z - a}, \\\\ldots, 1)L(t) U U(t)has determinant with one less zero (by multiplicity) at a, without introducing any poles in the lower half plane of any of the entries.  Extend analyticity to all of C  After modifications, the decomposition P(t)=Q(t) Q(t)^*satisfies Q(t) is analytic and invertible on the lower half plane. To extend analyticity to the upper half plane we need this key observation: Given a rational matrix Q(t) who is analytic in the lower half plane and nonsingular in the lower half plane, we have Q(t)^{-1} is analytic and nonsingular in the lower half plane. The analyticity follows from the adjugate matrix formula (since both the entries of Q(t) and \\\\det(Q(t))^{-1}are analytic on the lower half plane). The nonsingularity follows from \\\\det(Q(t)^{-1}) = \\\\det(Q(t))^{-1}which can only have zeroes at places where \\\\det(Q(t)) had poles. The determinant of a rational polynomial matrix can only have poles where its entries have poles, so \\\\det(Q(t)) has no poles in the lower half plane. From our observation in Extension to Complex Inputs, we have P(t)=Q(t)Q(\\\\bar{t})^*for all complex numbers. This implies Q(\\\\bar{t})=(P(t)Q(t)^{-1})^*. Since Q(t)^{-1} is analytic on the lower half plane, Q(t) is analytic on the upper half plane. Finally if Q(t) has a pole on the real line then Q(\\\\bar{t})^*has the same pole on the real line which contradicts the fact P(t) has no poles on the real line (it is analytic everywhere by hypothesis). The above shows that if Q(t) is analytic and invertible on the lower half plane indeed Q(t) is analytic everywhere and hence a polynomial matrix. == Uniqueness == Given two polynomial matrix decompositions which are invertible on the lower half planeP(t)=Q(t) Q(\\\\bar{t})^*=R(t)R(\\\\bar{t})^* we rearrange to (R(t)^{-1} Q(t))(R(\\\\bar{t})^{-1} Q(\\\\bar{t}))^*=I. Since R(t) is analytic on the lower half plane and nonsingular, R(t)^{-1}Q(t) is a rational polynomial matrix which is analytic and invertible on the lower half plane. Then by the same argument as above we have R(t)^{-1}Q(t) is in fact a polynomial matrix which is unitary for all real t. This means that if \\\\mathbf{q}_i(t) is the ith row of Q(t)then \\\\mathbf{q}_i(t) \\\\mathbf{q}_i(\\\\bar{t})^* = 1. For real t this is a sum of non- negative polynomials which sums to a constant, implying each of the summands are in fact constant polynomials. Then Q(t) = R(t) Uwhere U is a scalar unitary matrix. == Example == Consider A(t) = \\\\begin{bmatrix} t^2 + 1 & 2 t \\\\\\\\\\\\ 2 t & t^2 + 1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{bmatrix}. Then through symmetric Gaussian elimination we get the rational decomposition A(t) = \\\\begin{bmatrix} t - i & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\frac{2t}{t + i} & \\\\frac{t^2 - 1}{t + i} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\begin{bmatrix} t - i & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\frac{2t}{t + i} & \\\\frac{t^2 - 1}{t + i} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{bmatrix}^* . This decomposition has no poles in the upper half plane. However the determinant is \\\\frac{(t-1) (t-i) (t+1)}{t+i}, so we need to modify our decomposition to get rid of the singularity at -i. First we multiply by a scalar unitary matrix to make a column vanish at i. Consider U =\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2}} \\\\begin{bmatrix}1 & 1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ i & -i \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{bmatrix}. Then we have a new candidate for our decomposition \\\\begin{bmatrix} t - i & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\frac{2t}{t + i} & \\\\frac{t^2 - 1}{t + i} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{bmatrix} U = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2}}\\\\begin{bmatrix} t-i & t - i \\\\\\\\\\\\ i \\\\frac{(t-i)^2}{t+i} & -i(t+i) \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{bmatrix}. Now the first column vanishes at i, so we multiply through (on the right) by U(t) =\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2}} \\\\begin{bmatrix}\\\\frac{t+i}{t-i} & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 1\\\\end{bmatrix} to obtain Q(t) = \\\\begin{bmatrix} t - i & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\frac{2t}{t + i} & \\\\frac{t^2 - 1}{t + i} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{bmatrix} U U(t) = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2}}\\\\begin{bmatrix} t + i & t - i \\\\\\\\\\\\ i(t-i) & -i(t+i) \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{bmatrix}. Notice \\\\det(Q(t)) = i(1-t^2). This is our desired decomposition A(t) = Q(t) Q(t)^* with no singularities in the lower half plane. ==See also== *Matrix factorization of a polynomial == References == Category:Matrix decompositions Category:Polynomials ","title":"Polynomial matrix spectral factorization"},{"id":"54112343","text":"Jinder is both a surname and a given name.

It is part of what is known as the Northeast Kingdom (NEK) of Vermont. The community is located on the Lamoille River and along Vermont Route 16, west-northwest of St. Johnsbury. East Hardwick has a post office with ZIP code 05836, which opened on October 10, 1810. According to a 1937 WPA Federal Writers Project Guidebook, East Hardwick is a \\"side hill village spilling from the level of a plateau down a sharp incline in the valley of the Lamoille. It is surrounded by rich farm lands, Maple groves and forests.\\" ==History== The building of the Bayley-Hazen Military Road facilitated growth of this area of Vermont. General Bayley began this road in 1776 for the purposes of conveying troops and provisions into Canada. The project was abandoned but begun again in 1779. In 1989 the Vermont Division for Historic Preservation completed a Historic Sites and Structures Survey of the village, designating an East Hardwick Historic District. Much of the following information is derived from the Statement of Significance and other portions of that document. In 1797 Samuel Stevens (1775-1838, m. Puah Melon) came to the area. He was the first settler of East Hardwick, then called Stevensville or Stevens Mills. By 1800 Stevens had erected a sawmill and a grist mill. He was known as an intelligent and enterprising man who practiced temperance and exerted a moral influence on the village. By 1885 Stevensville was a thriving community, boasting two general stores, two churches, a carriage factory, a saw mill, a grist mill and several dwellings. Architecture The first period of East Hardwick's growth dates from approx. 1800 - 1850. During this time two Federal style houses and many Greek Revival residences and commercial structures were built along Main Street. The second period of growth dates from 1870 to 1900. During this period building continued in the Greek Revival style, one structure with Gothic Revival influence and many with embellishments in the Italianate style. Several Colonial Revival buildings were erected at the turn of the century. By the 1880s most of the present structures in the village had been built. East Hardwick is fortunate to have retained a wealth of 18th century structures. Generally, these structures are well preserved. Some are at-risk but still retain many of their original features. Railroads The St. J. and L. C. railroad passed through East Hardwick Village where there was a station on what is now Church Street. The station no longer exists, The railroad began construction in December 1869 as part of the Vermont Division of the Portland and Ogdensburg Railway to connect the Great Lakes with the seaport of Portland, Maine. It would be completed on July 17, 1877 (3). By 1891 the St J. & L. C. trains going west to Rouses Point with connections to the Great Lakes, left East Hardwick Station at 8:55, 4:46 and 7:25 and trains going east left at 6:16, 10:58 and 8:00 for St. Johnsbury. Currently the tracks through East Hardwick are owned by the State of Vermont and are being developed as part of the Lamoille County Rail Trail. Active development of the trail from East Hardwick Village to Hardwick Village began in the summer of 2020 with the installation of two large bridges crossing the Lamoille River, signage has been installed at the trailheads and the trail has been brushed so that it is now suitable for walking, horseback riding and for mountain bikes. No motorized vehicles are permitted in the summer season. Current day Today the brick house built by Samuel Stevens is a perennial garden center with an English tea garden where the owners serve lunch and afternoon tea on the lawn adjacent to the house and overlooking the river. An unimproved rail trail follows the river below the brick house and provides a path for those who want to walk or snow shoe along the river. The village is mostly a bedroom community and boasts a nursery school, an art gallery, a chiropractic office in the old school house, a mini-mart and an auto repair facility, as well as a few businesses along the highway. There is a small but active Congregational Church and a Grange Hall. Caledonia Grange #9 on Church Street is the oldest continuously operating Grange in New England. It is listed in the State Register of Historic Places and the National Register of Historic Places. The building also hosts summer concerts, meetings and educational workshops. Additionally, the community supports a charming springtime children's parade and a fall harvest dinner at the Church. At the corner of Main and School Streets there is a Women's Christian Temperance Union water tub. It is planted with flowers each spring by the women of the community, who retreat to a nearby porch for gin and tonic after this activity. There is an active group of \\"villagers\\" who in 2019, under the name East Hardwick Neighborhood Organization, formed a Vermont non-profit corporation with 501c(3) standing and are working to preserve structures and improve community life in the village. Current projects include preserving a 1910 Village Library and developing a park along the Lamoille Valley Rail Trail. In 2018 the village was selected as a Designated Village Center by the Vermont Agency of Commerce and Community Development. This community revitalization program helps maintain or evolve small to medium-sized historic centers with existing civic and commercial buildings. The designation supports the historic center and targets training and financial incentives to bring additional public and private investment to spark village revitalization. ==Government== East Hardwick Village is part of the incorporated Town of Hardwick. The town is managed by a town manager and five member select board. The town holds an annual town meeting in March. The town has one elementary school (K-6). Grades 7-12 attend the Hazen Union School (Greensboro, Hardwick, Woodbury) which is located in Hardwick. Additional programs available within the district include Green Mountain Training Center, the Central Vermont Career Center, Dual Enrollment, Early College and Pathways/Independent Study. The enrollment levels over the last ten years span from 314 students to 376 students. East Hardwick was never an incorporated village, but was established as a Vermont Fire District, the East Hardwick Fire District #1 (EHFD#1) in 1912, having powers to collect taxes, post bonds, build sidewalks, build a reservoir and water lines, instal street lights and other community improvements. Today, most of those duties, including the collection of taxes, are the provence of the town of Hardwick. However, the EHFD#1 still exists as a water board and it also owns several small plots of land in the village, as well as the old firehouse and library building. Sanborn Cemetery is on Montgomery Hill in East Hardwick. It is owned by the town of Hardwick but managed by a local board of trustees. East Hardwick does not have a sewage treatment plant; residences and businesses have private septic systems. The village of East Hardwick has its own water system, fed by springs and wells and gravity fed into the village and managed by the EHFD#1. The Hardwick police department and volunteer ambulance service and the Hardwick and Greensboro Fire Districts service the village. ==References== Category:Unincorporated communities in Caledonia County, Vermont Category:Unincorporated communities in Vermont ","title":"East Hardwick, Vermont"},{"id":"54112397","text":"Double Falls, is a waterfall located in the Silver Falls State Park at the east end of the city of Salem, in Marion County, in the U.S. state of Oregon.

He opened the first brickyard in Iowa City and provided the bricks for many of its oldest buildings, including the Old Capitol. with He also provided the bricks for his own house, which is the first in the area to have a mansard roof. Because the floor plan is very similar to the 18th century double-hipped roof houses in his native Connecticut it is very possible they were the inspiration for this house.

It is also the fastest double ascents of the tallest crest by a woman. She is from Bomdila, headquarters of West Kameng district, Arunachal Pradesh - the state that holds most north-eastern position of India. == Career== Jamsenpa summited the Mount Everest in 2011 first time 12 May and she made a second summit also on 21 May. She summited the Mount Everest in 2013 in the 2013 North East India Everest Expedition led by Surjit Singh Leishangthem.

It is the fastest double ascents of the tallest crest by a woman. This was her fifth summit and thus she became the most time climbed Indian woman. After taking the blessings of 14th Dalai Lama she began her Everest climbing expedition from Guwahati on 2 April 2017. She took 38 days schedule for acclimatization at the Everest Base Camp (at 17,600 ft) and started her main journey on 4 April.

The headwaters originate in Buckingham Township, Bucks County, Pennsylvania and the stream flows generally southeast to its confluence with Mill Creek in Wrightstown Township. Major tributaries of the Upper and Middle Neshaminy Creek include the West and North Branch of Neshaminy Creek, Pine Run, Cooks Run, Mill Creek, Lahaska Creek, Robin Run, Watson Creek, and Newtown Creek, all of which flow into the Main Stem Neshaminy Creek. The Geographic Name Information System I.D. is 1185219,http://geonames.usgs.gov/apex/f?p=gnispq:3:::NO::P3_FID:1185219 U.S. Department of the Interior Geological Survey I.D. is 02598.http://www.lycoming.edu/cwi/pdfs/paGazetterOfStreams.pdf Previously, the Neshaminy Water Resources Authority oversaw the dam, however, Bucks County assumed control and oversight of the dam(s). Robin Run in Buckingham Township is one of six county dams, including the Newtown Creek in Newtown Township, Nockamixon Dam in Pine Run in Doylestown, and, Core Creek in Middletown Township. For Robin Run, a regression analysis correlating existing discharges with drainage area was developed prior to construction of the dam. In 2009, Bucks County workers performed an unauthorized valve repair that flushed \\"tens of thousands\\" of healthy fish out of the reservoir to suffer and die on the banks downstream. Bucks County was fined by the PA DEP for the illegal action, however, the fine was unpaid, or was pad with the proceeds not used to correct the damage and replace the fish that were killed. As a result, the lake has not been re-stocked with fish and remains a depressing place to go fishing. ==Course== Robin Run rises a short distance northwest of Lower Mountain Road in Buckingham Township, flowing southeast flowing through a small unnamed pond then through Robin Run Lake, a dammed reservoir built by Bucks County in 1971, then passing into Wrightstown Township, where it meets its confluence with Mill Creek at 1.55 river mile. There are no other significant tributaries. ==Geology== Robin Run begins in the Lockatong Formation, a sedimentary rock layer deposited in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and New York during the Triassic Period. Mineralogy includes argillite, some shale, limestone, and calcareous shale named after the Lockatong Creek in Hunterdon County, New Jersey. In 2018, the United States Geological Survey was awarded a $60,000 grant to conduct a dam assessment and watershed study of Robin Run. The Lockatong is defined as a light to dark gray, greenish-gray, and black very fine grained sandstone, silty argillite, and laminated mudstone. In New Jersey, the cyclic nature of the formation is noted with hornfels near diabase and basalt flows. The Lockatong is often described as lake or litoral sediments. The interfingering nature of the sediments with the surrounding Stockton Formation and Passaic Formation suggests that these littoral environments shifted as climate or as the dynamic terrane of the area developed. The deposition of calcitic sediments is indicative of a climate with high evaporation rates. *Appalachian Highlands Division **Piedmont Province ***Gettysburg-Newark Lowland Section ****Lockatong Formation ****Brunswick Formation It very quickly finds itself in the Brunswick Formation, a sedimentary rock layer deposited during the Jurassic and Triassic.

The Hornnes Church is located on the south end of the village near the lake Breidflå (part of the river Otra). ==History== The village of Hornnes was the administrative centre of the old municipalities of Hornnes og Iveland (1838-1886) and of Hornnes (1886-1960). The village grew up on the west shore of the river Otra, at the confluence with the river Dåselva. The village of Evje grew up on the opposite side of the river, about to the northeast and it was the administrative centre of a separate municipality: Evje. Today, they are part of the same municipality and the villages have grown together. ==Name== The village of Hornnes is named after an old Hornnes farm (Old Norse: Hornnes), since the first Hornnes Church was built there. The first element is horn which means \\"horn\\" and the last element is nes which means \\"headland\\".

It will be the first rapid transit line to operate in Vietnam. Construction of the 13.1-km line started on October 2011 and was initially scheduled to be completed by 2013. The completion has been delayed due to several hurdles including finalizing funding from the government of China. The original cost estimate of $552.86 million has also ballooned to more than $868 million. Most of the funding for the project is financed by preferential loans from the Export Import Bank of China. The rest of funding is from the Vietnamese government. The bulk of the construction was completed by the fourth quarter of 2018. Operational tests were conducted at the end of 2018 and again in 2019. == Stations == The stations are built and designed with the concept of station variety. Each station has a distinct color. For example, La Khe station has a light green theme. All stations have curvy roofs, suitable for the hot, humid and rainy climate of Vietnam and consistent with Southeast Asian architecture. The roofs are covered with light-absorbing, wind- protection and radiation-proof materials. Some stations, such as Cat Linh Station, are designed with modern and neighborhood-multifunctional styles.

He was twice suffect consul: for the first time in the nundinium of September to October 70 AD;Paul Gallivan, \\"The Fasti for A. D. 70–96\\", Classical Quarterly, 31 (1981), pp. 200, 213 and the second time in 85 with Lucius Valerius Catullus Messalinus as his colleague, succeeding the Emperor Domitian.Gallivan, \\"The Fasti for A. D. 70–96\\", pp. 190, 216 Gallicus was well thought of by both the emperors Claudius and Nero. He was an important supporter of Vespasian in his early period as emperor and was rewarded by being made consul only months after Vespasian's arrival in Rome. Gallicus held a series of further civic and military positions, including three governorships, pontifex, and urban prefect of Rome. ==Family== He was often referred to by the shorter name Gaius Rutilius Gallicus, which Olli Salomies notes was his name prior to his adoption; Gallicus was a member of the gens Rutilia from Augusta Taurinorum, the modern Turin. The general consensus is that the adoptive element is Quintus Julius Cordius, and when his full name was used \\"Gaius\\" was frequently dropped. Although a Quintus Julius Cordius was the suffect consul of 71, Salomies doubts he was the adoptive father, although \\"no doubt closely related\\" to him.Salomies, Adoptive and polyonymous nomenclature in the Roman Empire, (Helsinski: Societas Scientiarum Fenica, 1992), pp. 116f and note J.E.H. Spaul suggested his birth father was Gaius Rutilius Secundus, equestrian governor of Mauretania Tingitana during the reign of the emperor Claudius.Spaul, \\"Governors of Tingitana\\", Antiquités africaines 30 (1994), p. 237 Gallicus was married and his wife's name is known from an inscription found in Augusta Tauricorum: Minicia L.f. Paetina. == Biography == Offices under the Julio-Claudians Gallicus' first known post was as military tribune of Legio XIII Gemina, which he is attested as holding in 52. = ILS 9499 This was followed by the Republican magistracies of quaestor and curule aedile. He then served again in the military as the legatus, or commander, of Legio XV Apollinaris during the reign of the emperor Claudius. During Gallicus' term as legatus the legion was stationed in Pannonia. Following this he was assigned to govern the province of Galatia in central Anatolia. In 68 Gallicus was co-opted into the sodales Augustales, the collegia of priests. = ILS 5025 This role was important to the Julio-Claudian dynasty, and the appointment is a clear indication that Gallicus was favored by the emperor Nero. Offices under the Flavians In addition to being favored by Nero, he was also well regarded by Vespasian. Gallicus was appointed consul by Vespasian very shortly after his arrival in Rome as a new emperor. The consulship was considered the highest honour the Roman state could bestow, and Vespasian would have made such appointments carefully, to reward loyalty and to consolidate support. Gallicus would have served alongside a fellow consul, but who this was is not recorded. During Vespasian's reign Gallicus was admitted to the College of Pontiffs, again a sign of the Emperor's high esteem. He was Proconsular Governor of Africa in 73/74.Werner Eck, \\"Jahres- und Provinzialfasten der senatorischen Statthalter von 69/70 bis 138/139\\", Chiron 12 (1982), p. 293 Although being proconsul of Africa or Asia was considered a senator's highest and usually the final step in imperial service, Gallicus is known to have been Governor of Germania Inferior from 76 to 78.Eck, \\"Jahres- und Provinzialfasten\\", pp. 297–300 He was appointed consul for a second time seven years later by the emperor Domitian, serving with Lucius Valerius Catullus Messalinus. Gallicus' final office was urban prefect of Rome, which he held around 91. ==Death== Statius dedicated a poem to him (Silvae, 1.4), celebrating his recovery from illness. His recovery proved short-lived, as Statius notes Gallicus died from that same illness in the preface to the first book of Silvae, published not long after Gallicus' death. == References  Further reading == * John Henderson, A Roman life: Rutilius Gallus on paper and in stone.

She attended Camp Naivelt, a Jewish camp known for advocating socialist ideals, in Brampton, Ontario. The camp was known for supporting folk music culture and Klein would have gained exposure to musical styles and people who later figured in the folk revival in Canada. There Klein also met the man who would later become her husband. She married Jack in 1950. During the early 1950s Klein worked at Settlement House in Toronto. She organized music for children as well as advocated for better employment conditions for local musicians. This early involvement with the labour movement provided an important influence for her later work in advocating for the folk music community in Canada. Klein became the artistic director for the Mariposa Folk Festival from 1964,and remained in the position until 1980. She instituted a number of changes and she did not share the \\"purist\\" vision of folk music espoused by the previous artistic director of the Festival. She and is also noted for shaping the Festival format, a format, one that included more interaction with folk musicians through the development of workshops as well as including aboriginal artists in the festival. This was a format that was replicated at many other folk festival in Canada. The workshops were intended to bring together artists who might not normally perform together and often put them in close proximity to their audiences. This is a format that has been retained today. Her wider view of what constituted folk music influenced the artistic programming and saw the festival include American blues artists such as the Reverend Gary Davis, Inuit throat singing as well as Métis dancers. Klein formally incorporated indigenous content into the Festival in 1966 with an appearance by the Canadian Indian Dancers. In recognition of her contributions to folk music in Canada the Ontario Council of Folk Festivals established the Estelle Klein award as their highest award, intended to honour those who have provided major contributions to folk music in Canada. ==References== Category:1930 births Category:2004 deaths Category:Artistic directors (music) Category:People from Buffalo, New York ","title":"Estelle Klein"},{"id":"54113068","text":"Raghu was a ruler of the Indian Ikshvaku dynasty.

There Phegeus offered him succor and gave him his daughter Arsinoe or Alphesiboea, who received from Alcmaeon, as a wedding present, the robe and necklace of Harmonia. However, because of his crime, the ground became barren in Psophis and an oracle told Alcmaeon to depart to Achelous and to stand another trial on the river bank. So he went to the springs of Achelous, and was purified by him, receiving river-gods' daughter Callirrhoe to wife. After some time, Callirrhoe told Alcmaeon that she would not live with him if she did not get the robe and necklace of Harmonia, which now were owned by his first wife Arsinoe. Alcmaeon then went to Psophis and told Phegeus that it had been predicted that he should be rid of his madness when he had brought the robe and necklace to Delphi and dedicated them. Phegeus believing him, gave the said jewelry and clothing but a servant disclosed that his son-in-law was taking these belongings to Callirrhoe. So the sons of Phegeus, Pronous and Agenor or Temenus and Axion, following their father's orders, waited for Alcmaeon in an ambush and killed him.

It emulates swiping a physical card without having to upgrade the terminal's software or hardware to support more advanced technology, such as contactless payments. Hence, in contrast to payments using near-field communication, MST technology is compatible with nearly all payment terminals that possess a magnetic stripe reader. MST is designed to transmit from within of the magnetic card reader. Outside of physical transmission, there are no changes to the magnetic stripe card system (i.e., reception, processing, information content, and cryptographic protocols). However, the information being transmitted being dynamic may allow tokenization. MST was originally developed by LoopPay, which was acquired by Samsung in 2015 and incorporated into its Samsung Pay service. In 2017, LG launched its competing LG Pay service, which uses a similar technology called Wireless Magnetic Communication (WMC). The original MST and WMC mimicked unencrypted magnetic stripe technology in order to be compatible with older credit card terminals. The wireless transmissions were not encrypted and therefore not be considered \\"secure.\\" The Samsung Pay and LG implementations of MST use secure EMV compatible tokens and are considered to be secure. ==References== Category:Payment cards ","title":"Magnetic secure transmission"},{"id":"54113195","text":"Joe Parker is the athletic director at Colorado State University. ==College== Parker attended the University of Michigan where he was a three-time All- American swimmer, earning a bachelor's degree in economics.

He has been described as \\"the single most influential figure in the contemporary Thai literary world\\". The son of Sae Sawatsi, a doctor in the Thai army medical corps, he was born in Tha Ruea District, Ayutthaya province. At the end of World War II, his parents returned to Bangkok and he received his primary and secondary school education at Wat Don Muang. Sawatsi went on to study history at Thammasat University. After graduating in 1966, he taught history and geography at a private school for a short time. He was then able to secure a position as assistant to Sulak Sivaraksa, editor of the literary journal Sangkhomsat Parithat. When Sivaraksa left two years later, Sawatsi became editor. Under his editorship, the journal became more active politically, often criticizing the government. In 1977, when a new military regime took power, he was removed from the post of editor after the journal was brought back to a purely academic orientation. A number of stories by Sawatsi appeared in Sangkhomsat Parithat. In 1972, these stories were published as Khwam Ngiap (Silence). In 1977, he became editor of a new literary journal Lok Nangsu’. That publication was not profitable and ceased publication in 1984. He next was editor for Ban Mai Ru Roi and Samoso’n Thanon Nangsu’. In 1989, he was co- founder of the literary group Samnak Chang Wannakam, which published a quarterly short story magazine Cho’ Karaket until 2000. In 1997, he received the Sriburapha Award and, in 2005, the Pittisin Prize.

The capacity of each 4-wagon train is 916 passengers maximum, with a density of 6 passengers per meter square. The underground section, dug by Tunnel Boring Machine, consists of 2 single tubes. == Social and environmental impacts == * Land acquisition and resettlement: To transform Hanoi's transport system, the government may acquire some land along segments of the line, and around Nhon depot. A Resettlement Plan has been prepared and updated for the project, which is consistent with the Asian Development Bank's Safeguards Policy Statement, and the updated Resettlement and Compensation Policies of the government of Vietnam. * Environmental management: The development of the line involves significant construction works, which can generate adverse environmental impacts. These have been assessed in an international standard environmental impact assessment. The most significant impacts affecting Hanoi citizens during construction may include excessive dust and noise, traffic disturbances, and the relocation of mature trees along the metro alignment. All contractors have developed and are implementing robust environmental management plans and engineering solutions to minimize environmental impacts, and respond to any event. Overall, environmental benefits including improved air quality, reduced greenhouse gas emission and enhanced community health and safety will significantly outweigh the adverse environmental impacts. == See also == * Transport in Vietnam * Ho Chi Minh City Metro * Megaproject * Hanoi Metro ==ReferencesExternal links== Category:Rapid transit in Vietnam Category:Hanoi Metro Category:Proposed public transport in Asia ","title":"Line 3, Hanoi Metro"},{"id":"54113267","text":"Inland Revenue Department (IRD) Nepal is similar to the Department of Tax in Nepal.

His work helped pioneer aerial photography, panoramas, and light manipulation techniques. After settling in Waco, Texas, in 1905, Gildersleeve captured thousands of photographs depicting the city as it experienced an unprecedented period of growth. He first received recognition for his images of a biplane circling the Amicable building in 1911 and the Cotton Palace. In May 1916, he was on the scene when Jesse Washington, a black teenage farmhand, was lynched in front of a large crowd of onlookers. Gildersleeve's pictures of the event offer rare imagery of a lynching in progress. ==Early life and education== Fred A. Gildersleeve was born in Boulder, Colorado, in June 1881 but was raised in Kirksville, Missouri. In his youth, Gildersleeve was a race horse jockey, competing in county fairs throughout the state. While attending the state normal school, his mother purchased him an 1898 Kodak box camera. For 25 cents each, Gildersleeve sold images of fellow students to pay for his education. The aspiring photographer honed his craft by studying the trade further at an institute in Effingham, Illinois. Following his time in Effingham, Gildersleeve found work in Chicago before finally settling in Waco, Texas, in 1905 to manage his own studio. ==Career== Often working in tandem with his assistant Herbert Guinn, Gildersleeve rode through the city in an Excelsior motorbike and sidecar – later a Model T Ford – to capture scenes of everyday life in the city; his imagery of Waco's developing infrastructure and its populace was well received by the townspeople who fully welcomed and affectionately came to know the photographer as \\"Gildy\\". As his popularity rose, Gildersleeve was commissioned more than any other photographer in Waco for local events and meetings, including his roles as official photographer for Baylor University and the State Fair of Texas. \\"He was a man obsessed with freezing the moment in his adopted hometown\\", according to writer Joe Holley; indeed, thousands of photographs are credited to Gildersleeve, including his famed 1911 image of the Amicable building – Waco's first skyscraper – being circled in flight by aviator Calbraith Perry Rodgers. A few years later, he created a 12-foot wide panorama of the Cotton Palace, the world's largest photo at the time, and had it featured in exhibits across the United States. Gildersleeve's ambition to capture new perspectives of Waco's landmarks led him to pioneer aerial photography as he flew in biplanes.  Lynching of Jesse Washington  On May 15, 1916, a guilty verdict and a death sentence were announced at Waco's courthouse for Jesse Washington, a seventeen-year-old black farmhand, in complicity of the murder of Lucy Fryer, who was found dead seven days earlier. Attendees crowded the courthouse and sidewalks in anticipation of the trial; the crowd of about 2,000 spectators was almost entirely white aside from a few members of the city's black community. As officers approached Washington to escort him out of the courtroom, spectators pushed them aside and forcibly dragged Washington outside. Amid a growing mob, a chain was wrapped around Washington's neck, and he was stripped and beaten as he was taken to city hall. A bonfire was prepared next to a tree; doused in oil, Washington was repeatedly lowered into the flames and slowly burned to death in front of nearly 15,000 onlookers. Perhaps at the request of mayor John Dollins, Gildersleeve arrived at the third floor of city hall shortly before Washington's lynching and photographed the event. His photographs offer rare depictions of an event in progress: views of the large crowd from the building and closer shots of Washington's corpse, possibly taken by an assistant. In some images, individuals from the crowd gathered around Washington to collect souvenirs from his body, making no attempts to hide their identities. Afterwards, Gildersleeve produced postcards of the lynching, a common practice of the era. A few postcards were sent out-of-state but local citizens persuaded Gildersleeve to stop selling them, fearing that the images would harm Waco's idyllic reputation.  Later life  Later in his career, hundreds of acetate negatives belonging to Gildersleeve were lost following divorce with his wife of thirty years. He experienced a significant decline in his health in the 1950s; on February 26, 1958, he died aged 77. Gildersleeve's will left his collection of 1,400 photographs to Roger Norman Conger, a Waco- based historian who, in an effort to preserve the images, donated Gildersleeve's work to the Texas Collection at Baylor University and the Lee Lockwood Library and Museum in Waco. == References == Category:1881 births Category:1958 deaths Category:Social documentary photographers Category:People from Boulder, Colorado ","title":"Fred Gildersleeve"},{"id":"54113335","text":"Love, Timeless () is a 2017 Taiwanese television series created and produced by Eastern Television.

Anabo (born August 24, 1939) is a former professional gridiron football quarterback who played for the Edmonton Eskimos of the Canadian Football League. From 1964 to 1965, he played in 11 regular season games, passing for 803 yards, five touchdowns, and eight interceptions. Prior to playing for the Eskimos, Anabo played for the Fresno State Bulldogs and spent time on the practice squad of the Cleveland Browns from the National Football League. While in college, Anabo was one of the top passing quarterbacks among West Coast programs. He played in tandem with fellow quarterback Beau Carter in 1961 and 1962 as he helped lead the Bulldogs to an undefeated season. Anabo was twice named to the All-West Coast team released by United Press International. Anabo was selected in the 19th round of the 1962 NFL Draft by the Cleveland Browns and the 23rd round of the 1963 AFL Draft by the Oakland Raiders. == Early career == Anabo attended Armijo High School before going on to play college football at Vallejo Junior College (later renamed Solano Community College) from 1958 to 1960. While at Vallejo, Anabo also played baseball. In 2004, Anabo was inducted into the Solano Community College Hall of Fame. In 1961, Anabo transferred to Fresno State University to play for the Fresno State Bulldogs. The Bulldogs played two different units of offensive players, and Anabo split playing time with fellow quarterback Beau Carter. He was credited for leading the Bulldogs to an upset victory of the University of the Pacific in the game's final seconds. The Bulldogs had a perfect season in 1961 as Anabo passed for 454 yards and eight touchdowns. Fresno State defeated the Bowling Green Falcons 36–6 in the Mercy Bowl, and Anabo was named to the United Press International West Coast Small College All-Star team the following week. In 1962, Anabo and Carter were described as the \\"best 1-2 quarterback punch on the West Coast\\". The duo ranked sixth in the nation in total passing yardage through the third week of November. Anabo set new records for Fresno State in passing and was again named to the All-Coast team. Anabo was selected for the All-American Bowl representing the Small Schools All-Star team, and the Small Schools won the annual game for the first time after Anabo scored a touchdown on a quarterback run in the fourth quarter. He ended his college career with 96 completions on 178 attempted passes for 1,334 yards and 17 touchdowns. Anabo also participated in the high jump event for the track and field team at Fresno State. == Professional career ==  Cleveland Browns  In 1962, the Cleveland Browns selected Anabo in the nineteenth round of the 1962 NFL Draft with the 263rd overall pick. The Oakland Raiders of the American Football League selected Anabo the following year in the twenty-third round of the 1963 AFL Draft with the 177th overall pick. Anabo chose to sign with the Browns in January 1963. After attending training camp with the Browns, Anabo was placed on the practice squad for the entirety of the 1963 season. Anabo attempted to make the Browns' regular season roster in 1964. In his first drive with the Browns during a preseason game, Anabo threw a 74-yard touchdown pass to flanker Walter Roberts. In September, the Browns released Anabo as part of their final roster cuts before the regular season.  Edmonton Eskimos  After being released by the Browns, Anabo signed with the Edmonton Eskimos of the Canadian Football League. He played six regular season games for the Eskimos in 1964, passing for 621 yards with four touchdowns and seven interceptions. By the end of the season, Anabo was starting for the Eskimos. He played in five regular season games in 1965 but averaged only 3.9 yards per attempt. In August, Anabo suffered a minor injury which he played through later in the month. After starting the season with a 0–5 record, the Eskimos cut Anabo in late August. == Later life == After retiring from professional football, Anabo coached high school football at Hoover High School. After serving as a quarterback and receivers coach at Fresno State, Anabo started a career in broadcasting as a football color commentator. == References == Category:1939 births Category:Living people Category:American football quarterbacks Category:Canadian football quarterbacks Category:Fresno State Bulldogs football players Category:Cleveland Browns players Category:Edmonton Eskimos players Category:American players of Canadian football Category:Players of American football from California Category:Sportspeople from Los Angeles Category:High school football coaches in California Category:Fresno State Bulldogs football coaches ","title":"Jon Anabo"},{"id":"54113499","text":"Pachyclymeniidae was an extinct family of ammonites that existed during the Devonian. ==References== Category:Devonian ammonites Category:Late Devonian first appearances Category:Late Devonian animals Category:Famennian extinctions Category:Cyrtoclymeniina Category:Ammonite families ","title":"Pachyclymeniidae"},{"id":"54113506","text":"The Czech Republic and Taiwan (officially the Republic of China, shortly ROC) maintain unofficial relations since the recognition of the One-China policy of the People's Republic of China by Czechoslovakia from 1979.

His job is to convey the King of France (King Charles VI )'s messages, including the constable's harsh message to King Henry. However, he conveys them in such a polite and respectable way that King Henry thinks on him favourably; an example of this can be seen when King Henry tips him when he has conveyed a message. == Role in the play == Montjoy first appears in Act III, scene VI of the play to convey the King of France( King Charles VI )'s messages to King Henry V. King of France thought that English troops defeat if France's rush to the battlefield because English has not enough strength of an army than France, so he let him ask the King of England what he is willing to pay us to get out of the war. In the second act Montjoy appears in Act IV, Scene III in the English Camp. He delivered the constable of France's messages to King Henry. Montjoy changed the message of harsh language to polite language. France's constable ordered unconditional attack to English army, but Montjoy summoned to surrender in a polite way. After he conveyed the message, he said, \\"I shall, King Harry. And so fare thee well. Thou never shalt hear herald anymore.\\" However, Henry predicted that he will come to Henry again for king of France's ransom. In the final act, Montjoy briefly appears in Act IV, Scene VII in the another part of the field. He capitulated to English enemy, saying that \\"I come to thee for charitable license. The day is yours.\\" He finally admitted France's defeat. ==Adaptations== In Henry V (1989), directed by and starring Kenneth Branagh, Montjoy is portrayed by Christopher Ravenscroft. In this film, Montjoy also appears in Act I, Scene II, as one of the French ambassadors who delivers the condescending gift of tennis balls on behalf of the Dauphin, Louis, Duke of Guyenne. ==ReferencesExternal links== *Speeches (Lines) for Montjoy in \\"Henry V\\", OpenSourceShakespeare Category:Shakespearean characters ","title":"Montjoy"},{"id":"54113568","text":"Jeff Lewis is a singer-songwriter from Dallas, Texas.

He was drafted by Adelaide with their first selection and fifteenth overall in the 2016 national draft. He made his debut in the eighty point win against the at the Gabba in round nine of the 2017 season. ==Early life== Gallucci grew up in the hills to the east of Melbourne. He attended Yarra Valley Grammar School where he also starred at volleyball as well as football. In 2016 he captained the Eastern Ranges in the TAC Cup where he impressed as a midfielder-forward, kicking five goals and getting 21 disposals against the Western Jets late in the season. He was also a co-captain of Vic Metro in the 2016 AFL Under 18 Championships, where he ranked second out of all mid-forwards for metres gained. Gallucci was part of the 2016 Draft Combine, where he broke the record in the standing vertical jump test, reaching 89 cm. This broke the previous record of 88 cm and was 13 cm above any others at the combine that year. He also won the repeat sprint test and was in the top ten of both the running vertical jump test and the beep test. In the leadup to the 2016 AFL draft, Gallucci attracted interest from the Adelaide Football Club. ==AFL career== Gallucci was drafted by the Adelaide Football Club with their first pick in the 2016 AFL National Draft, the fifteenth selection overall. His good friend Myles Poholke was also drafted by the Crows with their second draft pick. When he joined the team, Gallucci was given the number 7 jumper, which had previously been worn by dual premiership player Nigel Smart and club captain Nathan van Berlo. Gallucci got his first opportunity to play for Adelaide in the 2017 JLT Community Series. After being left out of the Crows’ side for the opening match, he played against , where he had nine possessions, including five in the last quarter, in a thrilling six-point win. Once the AFL season started he was playing for the Crows’ reserves team in the SANFL. In the first match of the season against , he performed a full-body smother to help save the match, leading to a two-point victory for the Crows. In an SANFL game against he injured his shin and was unable to play in the second half, which caused him to miss the next game, but he was able to return for the SANFL Showdown against ’s reserves team. He returned from injury well and finished with 24 disposals and five clearances against the Magpies. Gallucci made his AFL debut in an eighty-point win against the at the Gabba in round nine. He finished with 11 possessions and a goal for the match, which wasn’t enough to retain his position in the side as he was omitted from the team the next week. He was selected as a non-playing emergency against , then returned to the SANFL side. Gallucci was among Adelaide’s best in the second SANFL Showdown of the season, with 24 possessions and seven tackles to his name in a 58-point loss, the side’s worst loss since joining the SANFL. As his form continued to improve, he started to be selected more regularly as an emergency for AFL matches, but his season came to a premature end when he was put on the long-term injury list after breaking his jaw in a SANFL match against and was ruled out for the rest of the season. ==Player profile== As a junior, Gallucci was an outstanding athlete. He played as a midfielder capable of carrying the ball with pace, but also has the versatility to play across half-forward. He was a good mark with his powerful leap and had a strong work ethic. He showed leadership skills as well, being a co-captain of Vic Metro in the 2016 AFL Under 18 Championships and also captaining the Eastern Ranges in the TAC Cup. He was described by four-time Hawthorn premiership player Gary Buckenara as a “polished player who has good pace and is very athletic”, and his Eastern Ranges coach, former Essendon premiership player Darren Bewick, compared him favourably to 2016 Norm Smith medallist Jason Johannisen. ==Statistics== : Statistics are correct to the end of the 2017 seasonJordan Gallucci's player profile at AFL Tables - - style= ! scope=\\"row\\"   2017 style=\\"text- align:center;\\"  7  1  1  0  7  4  11  2  3  1.0  0.0  7.0  4.0  11.0  2.0  3.0 - class=\\"sortbottom\\" ! colspan=3 Career ! 1 ! 1 ! 0 ! 7 ! 4 ! 11 ! 2 ! 3 ! 1.0 ! 0.0 ! 7.0 ! 4.0 ! 11.0 ! 2.0 ! 3.0 } ==ReferencesExternal links== * * Category:1998 births Category:Living people Category:Adelaide Football Club players Category:Eastern Ranges players Category:Australian rules footballers from Victoria (Australia) Category:Australian people of Italian descent ","title":"Jordan Gallucci"},{"id":"54113825","text":"FiiO Electronics Technology Company, Ltd., or simply FiiO, is a Chinese electronics company founded in 2007 that primarily manufactures audio equipment.

Nowadays the street has lost lots of the meaning that it used to have and of its sinful atmosphere. After ten years, it is now a ring that makes a chain for the old Vacca's door, a famous step for tourists, that connects the modern seafront of the city to the old harbour. (recently remodelled by Renzo Piano). The parallel street is via di Prè, named after the Commenda di san Giovanni di Prè. In the middle of the street there is Vacchero square, where one can find \\"la Colonna infame\\" (made after Giulio Cesare Vacchero's will, that was protesting against the Genoa’s republic ). At the beginning of the street, there is a pedestrian side in fossatello square, where via lomellini starts and there is Giuseppe Mazzini’s native house, now assigned to a Risorgimento museum. == The memory of De André in Via del Campo == Plaque in Via Del Campo dedicated to Fabrizio de Andrè In via del Campo, there is the record store that belongs to Gianno Tassio, good friend of Fabrizio De Andre, who loved the store since his youth. The commercial hub makes a sort of museum: the people who walk by it can listen to all Faber songs while they can see though the windows the whole records’ collection. Inside the shop there is De Andrè's famous guitar. It was bought by Giovanni Tassio with all the generous support of the city for the Emergency association. They actually gathered funds for the value of 168 million and 500,000 lira. The money was used to build a new hospital in Sierra Leone, that has been named after De Andrè. Gianni Tassio died in 2004. His work was led by his wife, Daniela Tassio, until 24 February 2010.

Most velomobiles in this class use three wheels, and so it is instructive to compare the four-wheel QuattroVelo against three-wheel designs. \\"Speed\\" velomobiles (compared to \\"cargo\\" velomobiles) are limited mainly by aerodynamics and rolling drag. Thus, \\"low aerodynamic drag\\" has long been a focus for such designs. Three- wheel designs tend to have better aerodynamics than four-wheel designs: * Wheels are disks, and thus not very aerodynamic compared to a teardrop or other aerodynamic shapes. * There are significant aerodynamic losses where each wheel enters the fairing. * A two-in-front one-in-rear \\"tadpole\\" configuration means the velomobile can be narrow in the rear and thus approximate a teardrop shape, such as a Kamm tail. Beyond aerodynamics, three wheels instead of four has other advantages: * Three wheels weigh less than four. * Pairs of wheels can be misaligned (toe in or toe out) so they track in slightly different directions, and thus must slip or \\"scrub\\" slightly as they roll which causes drag. If a single wheel is misaligned it can steer the vehicle, but does not cause drag. Three wheels have at least three significant disadvantages compared to four: * Three-wheel cornering stability is much worse than a four-wheel vehicle of similar width. In one comparison, the three-wheeler tips at about 70% the cornering force of the four-wheeler. * Loss of traction of a single rear wheel, even while going straight, can cause roll-over accidents, with some serious injuries reported, whereas with a pair of wheels, one wheel can lose traction but the other still provides some direction control. * The centrally-located rear wheel makes it difficult to make a large luggage area. Three wheel velomobiles have enough space for sporting use (spare clothes, a few tools), but limited for transportation/utility use (shopping, carrying tools etc. to work). For the above reasons, most \\"aerodynamic\\"-class velomobiles have used a tadpole tricycle configuration, while most four-wheel velomobiles have been used for \\"transportation\\"- and \\"cargo\\"-class velomobiles. ==Development== In 2009, Miles Kingsbury was racing a tadpole tricycle velomobile, and often lost to a competitor riding a streamliner (which Kingsbury had designed and built). Kingsbury concluded one reason he lost to the streamliner was limited cornering stability of his tricycle. He calculated that it was plausible to build a 4-wheel velomobile which would both have the needed stability and also have good enough aerodynamics to be competitive. He then designed and built a 4-wheel velomobile, which he called the Quattro Kingsbury finished just in time to ship it to the USA to participate in ROAM, a group of several dozen velomobie riders riding from coast to coast. Several ROAM riders were impressed that Kingsbury in his Quattro had good cornering stability; was able to keep pace with riders with \\"aerodynaic\\"-class velomobiles; and had much larger stowage volume -- an issue of practical value for velomobiles used for everyday transportation. This led several velomobile designers to re-consider 4 wheels for aerodynamic velomobiles -- despite the inherent drag losses of 4 wheels compared to three. Velomobiles.nl claims for a given width, four wheels offer 40% higher cornering stability than a tadpole tricycle of similar width and center of gravity. Or, a tricycle would need to be 40% wider to get the same stability; but since air drag is directly related to frontal area, making the tricycle wide would directly hurt aerodynamics. As of 2017/05 there are several projects by various makers to introduce \\"aerodynamic\\"-class 4-wheel velomobiels; the QuattroVelo is of special interest because (as of 2017/05) tens of units are in the hands of private owners and so can be used for independent testing. ==Comparison== The QuattroVelo may be compared against other \\"aerodynamic\\"-class velomobiles. As of 2017, some of the fastest tadpole velomobiles are the DF, Milan, and Quest. The Quest is made by Velomobiels.nl, but the others are not. Production of the QuattroVelo is (2017/05) tens of units, limiting the volume of independent tests, but several riders have both a QuattroVelo and another \\"aerodynamic\\"-class velomobie; and report in public forums QuattroVelo speed is nearly as fast as several \\"best in class\\" three- wheel velomobiles such as the DF and Milan. Another comparison is cargo capacity. One practical use is commuting and/or shopping. A tricycle with a single rear wheel typically has two small compartments, one on either side of the rear wheel. A quadracycle can have one large stowage area between the rear wheels. A single large stowage area is often more useful, as it can hold cargo which cannot be easily divided among several small compartments. A humorous competition demonstrated that a Quattrovelo can hold 26 six-packs of beer in glass bottles Although the competition was humorous, it demonstrates the practical stowage capacity of the Quattrovelo is both much larger than most \\"speed\\" velos, and also large enough for many daily uses. Another use is carrying a passenger. The Quattrovelo is offered standard with a second seat for a small (non-pedaling) rider. Most 3-wheel velomobiles drive (power) the single rear wheel, and a four-wheel velomobile with two driven wheels may have better drive traction. One reason is that many tricycles put about 1/3 of total weight on the drive wheel, while many quads put about 1/2 weight on the two drive wheels. Further, the Quattrovelo uses two ratchets, one to drive each rear wheel; thus, if one drive wheel loses traction, the other one continues to drive. Note this is different than driving via a simple differential, in which the loss of traction on one wheel causes the other wheel to stop driving. Several Quattrovelo riders are also riders of 3-wheel velomobiles and report online the Quattrovelo has much better traction and climbing on loose or slippery surfaces. There are two- and even three-wheel drive tricycles; so improved traction is not unique to the Quattrovelo, but it may be unique among \\"speed\\"-class production velomobiles. An alternative to \\"more/four wheels\\" is a longer and/or wider three-wheel velomobile. A wider profile hurts aerodynamics, but smoother air-flow can compensate to a degree. At the same time, CFRP is stiff and strong enough that the weight penalty for \\"larger three-wheeler\\" is comparable to the added weight for a \\"smaller four- wheeler\\". As of 2017/05, a main example of a good-aerodynamics three-wheel velomobile with large cargo capacity is the Milan 4.2 (\\"for two\\"). The Milan 4.2 is not directly comparable to the Quattrovelo, as the 4.2 has enough stowage for an adult passenger (though no passenger drivetrain). The weight and aerodynamics of the Milan 4.2 are thus broadly similar to the Quattrovelo; and stability depends significantly on cargo loading and weight distribution. ==References== Category:Human-powered vehicles ","title":"QuattroVelo"},{"id":"54114097","text":"Sally Riley (born 14 June 1990) is an Australian rules footballer playing for the Gold Coast Football Club in the AFL Women's competition. ==AFLW== She was drafted by Adelaide with their fifth selection and thirty-ninth overall in the 2016 AFL Women's draft.

A defender, tall, Foley plays primarily on the half-back line with the ability to push into the midfield. After spending her early life in country Victoria, in which she won a premiership and best and fairest with Bendigo Thunder, she moved to Darwin in 2013. Her career in the Northern Territory saw her win three consecutive premierships, two consecutive league best and fairests, a grand final best on ground medal, and interstate representation. Her performances in representative matches in 2016 saw her recruited by the Adelaide Football Club as a priority selection for the inaugural AFLW season. Her first season in the AFLW saw her win a premiership, and in her two seasons in the AFLW, she has been named in the top five of Adelaide's best and fairest in both seasons and the initial forty player All-Australian squad. ==Early life== Foley was born and raised in Shepparton, Victoria. She played with the Bendigo Thunder in the Victorian Women's Football League north west conference, winning the club's inaugural best and fairest medal in 2011 and a premiership in the 2012 season. She moved to Darwin at the start of 2013 and joined the Waratah Football Club in the Northern Territory Football League (NTFL), winning the premiership in her first season with the club and the Brenda Williams Medal as the best on ground in the grand final. She won a further two premierships with the club in the 2014/15 and 2015/16 seasons and was also announced the league's most valuable women's player for both seasons. Foley represented the Northern Territory for the first time in 2015 when the territory faced South Australia in May. She was selected as part of the inaugural NT Thunder talent program in 2016 and represented the territory in April against Victoria and Tasmania. She was selected by the Melbourne Football Club for an exhibition match against the Brisbane Lions at the Melbourne Cricket Ground in May, with the NT News reporter, Marc McGowan, stating her two matches against Victoria and Tasmania were key to her selection for Melbourne. In June, she represented the Northern Territory against South Australia in a curtain raiser before the AFL versus match at Adelaide Oval. Her representative performances throughout the year saw her selected for Melbourne in the all-stars match against the in September at Whitten Oval, in which she kicked a goal and was named one of Melbourne's best players. Foley also played two seasons in the premier netball competition in Darwin for the Hoggies, but elected to give up the sport from the 2016 season to focus on her football career. ==AFLW career== Foley was recruited by the Adelaide Football Club as a priority selection in August 2016. She was named as Adelaide's inaugural co-vice-captain alongside Sally Riley in January 2017. She made her debut in the thirty-six point win against at Thebarton Oval in the opening round of the 2017 season. Her performance in the three point win against at Thebarton Oval in round three drew praise due to her limiting the impact of the league leading goalkicker, Darcy Vescio–keeping her to zero disposals after halftime–with the Australian Associated Press reporter, Ben McKay, writing she effectively shut down the dangerous forward. After the club finished second on the ladder, she was a part of Adelaide's premiership side after the club defeated by six points at Metricon Stadium in the AFL Women's Grand Final. She played every match in her debut season to finish with eight matches and finished equal fifth in the Adelaide Club Champion award with 81 votes alongside Rhiannon Metcalfe. After re-signing with Adelaide for the 2018 season, she was named one of Adelaide's vice-captains for the second consecutive season with Sally Riley. She played the opening two matches of the season before she was suspended for one match due to kneeing Daisy Pearce in the thirty-two point loss to at Casey Fields. In her return match, the draw against at Blacktown International Sportspark in round four, she recorded twenty disposals, six marks and three tackles, with Shepparton News journalist, Tyler Maher, writing she returned from suspension with a bang. In the four point win against at TIO Stadium in round six, she was the acting captain for the match and despite regular captains Erin Phillips and Chelsea Randall playing in the match, the club elected to give Foley the captaincy in front of her home crowd. For her performance in the match, in which she recorded fifteen disposals, six tackles and four marks, she was named in AFL Media's team of the week and received two league best and fairest votes, meaning she was adjudged the second best player on the ground by the field umpires. Her performances throughout the season saw her named in the initial forty player All-Australian squad and she finished fourth in Adelaide's Club Champion award with 106 votes. ==Statistics== :Statistics are correct to the end of the 2018 season. - EAEAEA\\" ! scope=\\"row\\"   2017   3  8  1  0  55  22  77  16  15  0.1  0.0  6.9  2.8  9.6  2.0  1.9 - ! scope=\\"row\\"   2018   3  6  0  0  69  11  80  18  21  0.0  0.0  11.5  1.8  13.3  3.0  3.5 - class=\\"sortbottom\\" ! colspan=3  Career ! 14 ! 1 ! 0 ! 124 ! 33 ! 157 ! 34 ! 36 ! 0.1 ! 0.1 ! 8.9 ! 2.4 ! 11.2 ! 2.4 ! 2.6 } ==Off-field== Outside of her football career, Foley is the director of sport at the Essington School Darwin in Nightcliff, Northern Territory.

Under serfdom, peasants usually required permission to leave the land they lived on. Running away was seen as the ultimate form of passive, non-violent peasant resistance (with the peasant rebellions being on the other end of the spectrum). Escape was a highly effective form of resistance, as it was difficult to prevent, damaging to the landowner, and difficult and costly in addressing. It was also one of the most common form of peasant resistance, a regular occurrence in the societies with serfdom. It is difficult to estimate the scale of the problem, but it was regarded as significant; in 18th century Russia for example tens of thousands of runaway peasants were captured every year, but that number likely represents only a fraction of those who successfully eluded recapture. Jezierski described the phenomenon of fugitive peasants as commonplace in medieval Poland. In most countries with the institution of serfdom, leaving one's land was illegal. However, where regulations existed, they were often poorly enforced, disputed by various stakeholders, and changed back and forth over time. In medieval Poland, for example, there were laws against the flight of peasants, but their enforcing was usually left in the hands of the landowners. As escape was sometimes encouraged by other landowners, who needed labor and promised better working conditions, even if such attitude was illegal and penalized by a fine, this compounded the problem. Similar problems existed in medieval Russia, Ottoman Empire, Germany, and other places. Stanziani writes about 17th century Russia: \\"For a few few fugitives who were returned to their 'legitimate owners', millions of other peasants were left in their new places\\". Legal cases involving run-away peasantry represented a significant part of legal proceedings in many countries, for example Duchy of Livonia. Peasants chose to escape if they felt they had little to lose, suffering from heavy taxation and exploitation, theft and hunger; they could also do so to avoid military conscription or religious persecution. Peasants usually ran away to neighboring provinces, or rarely, to foreign countries. Sometimes, however, differences between serfdom regimes in various countries encouraged international flight; law professor W.J. Wagner for example writes describing 18th century situation: \\"The situation of the peasants in Poland was better than in most other countries. In France and Germany, for example, the owners of landed estates had unlimited jurisdiction over them, including the power to punish by death. In Russia, their economic oppression was notorious, and one of the reasons Catherine II gave for the partition of Poland was the fact that thousands of peasants escaped from Russia to Poland to seek a better fate.\\" In Eastern Europe, the lands of the Cossacks were seen during the Early Modern Period as a refuge for many runaway serfs. This is reflected in a folk Russian saying \\"С Дону выдачи нет!\\" (\\"There is no extradition from the Don!\\"), in reference to Don Cossacks. ==See also== *Fugitive *History of serfdom *Fugitive slaves in the United States *Peasant movement *Timeline of abolition of slavery and serfdom *Protest emigration ==References== Category:Fugitives Category:Serfdom ","title":"Fugitive peasants"},{"id":"54114309","text":"Silver & Black is an unproduced American superhero film based on the Marvel Comics characters Silver Sable and Black Cat. It was to be made by Columbia Pictures in association with Marvel and distributed by Sony Pictures Releasing. The film was intended to be an installment of the Sony Pictures Universe of Marvel Characters, with Gina Prince-Bythewood directing from a screenplay she co-wrote with Lisa Joy, Chris Yost, and the writing team of Lindsey Beer and Geneva Robertson-Dworet. Black Cat was first to be included in a film with the unproduced Spider-Man 4, before being introduced in The Amazing Spider-Man 2 (2014). Development of a female superhero spin-off from the Spider-Man film franchise first began in October 2014; by March 2017, it was set to feature Black Cat and Silver Sable, with Yost writing. Prince- Bythewood joined in May, with filming set to take place in Atlanta, Georgia and Mexico. Pre-production work began, with Prince-Bythewood intending to cast a black actress in one of the title roles. However, the director was unhappy with the film's script which led to an indefinite delay in production while she and Sony re-developed the project. In July 2018, Prince-Bythewood chose to direct a different comic book adaptation, The Old Guard, and a month later Sony canceled Silver & Black. The studio began development of two new solo films, focusing on each of the title characters, with Prince-Bythewood expected to remain as a producer on both projects. By January 2020, Sony was instead developing the project as a television series. That July, Prince- Bythewood expressed interest in returning to the project following the release of The Old Guard. ==Background== In December 2009 the Marvel Comics character Felicia Hardy was set to be introduced in Spider-Man 4, with Anne Hathaway being looked at to play the role. Julia Stiles, Rachel McAdams, and Romola Garai were also considered. Director Sam Raimi wanted to take the character in a different direction from the comics in which she becomes the cat burglar known as Black Cat. Instead, Raimi wanted to have her become a supervillain named \\"Vulturess\\", to partner with John Malkovich as the Vulture. The next month, Sony announced that the Spider-Man franchise would be rebooted after Raimi decided to no longer pursue direct sequels to Spider-Man 3 (2007). In January 2013, Felicity Jones was in talks to join the second film in the reboot series, The Amazing Spider-Man 2 (2014), as Hardy. The character does not take on the Black Cat persona in the film. In December 2013, Sony revealed plans to use The Amazing Spider-Man 2 to establish their own expanded universe based on the Marvel properties the studio had the film rights to. Avi Arad and Matt Tolmach would produce the films as part of a franchise brain trust that also included Alex Kurtzman, Roberto Orci, Jeff Pinkner, Ed Solomon, and Drew Goddard, as well as The Amazing Spider-Man (2012) and The Amazing Spider-Man 2 director Marc Webb. However, after The Amazing Spider-Man 2 underperformed and with Sony \\"under tremendous pressure to perform [that had them taking] a hard look at their most important franchise\\", the direction of the new shared universe was rethought. Development of a female superhero spin-off film set in the expanded universe had begun, with Lisa Joy writing the screenplay and a 2017 release eyed. Potential characters to be featured in the film included Hardy, Silver Sable, Stunner, Firestar, and Spider-Woman. By October 2014, the planned film was known by the working title Glass Ceiling, and was set to be a team-up film featuring more than one of the female superhero characters connected to the Spider-Man comics. In January 2015, Jones expressed interest in reprising her role of Hardy and exploring the Black Cat side of the character, but stated that there were no plans for her to do so. The next month, Sony and Marvel Studios announced a new partnership that would see the latter produce the next Spider-Man film for Sony, and integrate the character into their Marvel Cinematic Universe. Sony still planned to produce the spin- off films, including the female superhero film, but would do so without Marvel's involvement. Despite this, the spin-off films were canceled by November 2015. ==Development== When Sony revived a Spider-Man spin-off featuring the character Venom in March 2017, the company was also believed to be \\"fast at work\\" on a female superhero spin-off as well, with Chris Yost rewriting Joy's script. Tolmach and Amy Pascal were set to produce the film, which would feature both Silver Sable and Black Cat. It would be set in Sony's own shared universe, the Sony Pictures Universe of Marvel Characters, and would not crossover with the Marvel Studios film Spider-Man: Homecoming (2017). Gina Prince-Bythewood signed on to direct in May 2017, and it was officially titled Silver & Black. Emily Carmichael was also considered to direct the film. A fan of big-budget genre films, Prince-Bythewood had been planning to take on such a film, despite suggestions that female directors were not interested in working on such projects. She was already focused on a different project at the time, but when she was shown the script for Silver & Black by Sony she immediately \\"saw the movie in [her] head\\" and chose to pursue this film instead. Prince-Bythewood was able to be specific about her vision for the project in meetings with the studio, saying, \\"It was exciting in those meetings because everything I was talking about, they loved.\\" Filming for Silver & Black was expected to begin in late 2017. ==Pre-production== Gina Prince-Bythewood was attached to direct the film and contribute to the screenplay in May 2017 In June 2017, Pascal said that Sony now intended to have their new Marvel-based films take place in \\"the same world\\" as Spider- Man: Homecoming, describing them as \\"adjunct\\" to that world. She said that Silver & Black would have connections with Venom, and that there was potential for Tom Holland's Spider-Man to appear in both films. By that point, Prince- Bythewood was writing a new draft of the script herself, and had begun planning the visuals and music for the film, which she hoped to begin casting for shortly. Prince-Bythewood was inspired by Patty Jenkins' superhero film Wonder Woman (2017), which had been released soon after she had signed on to direct Silver & Black. Prince-Bythewood met with Jenkins several times to discuss Wonder Woman, and to get advice on directing a big-budget female superhero film. In July, Columbia Pictures president Sanford Panitch explained that Sony was not interested in producing \\"conventional comic-book movies\\" and was looking to give each film in their MU a distinct style. Silver & Black was considered a dark buddy film, compared to Thelma & Louise (1991) and Midnight Run (1988). Prince-Bythewood wanted to explore \\"the story of two damaged women who are at war with each other but need each other to survive\\", and noted that both characters are haunted by the deaths of their parents in the comics. The film was officially set for release on February 8, 2019, with the villains Chameleon, Tombstone, and Tarantula being considered. In December, Ruth E. Carter joined as costume designer after doing so for Marvel's Black Panther (2018), and Kristi Zea signed on as production designer in January 2018. Also in January 2018, production on the film was expected to begin on March 5, 2018, and run through mid-June. Filming was set to primarily take place in Atlanta, Georgia, under the working title Tri-Border. Additional filming was set to take place in Mexico, which was believed to be for scenes depicting the Triple Frontier area bordering Brazil, Argentina, and Paraguay. Lindsey Beer and Geneva Robertson-Dworet had written a new draft of the screenplay by mid- February 2018, which they had handed back to Prince-Bythewood to polish. At that point, Prince-Bythewood had developed looks for the film's sets and costumes, scouted locations, storyboarded action sequences, and begun working with the visual effects team. ==Indefinite delay== Plans to begin filming were delayed indefinitely at the end of February because Prince-Bythewood was not yet happy with the script. Additional pre-production work, such as costume design, was also delayed until re-writes were completed, with Carter explaining that she was \\"waiting to get the signal\\" that she could continue work on the film. In May, Prince-Bythewood said she was \\"really looking to do something different within the [superhero] genre\\", wanting to elevate the two characters from the comics and \\"put them out in the world.\\" She added that though both characters are white in the comics, she intended to play with this by casting a black actress in one of the lead roles, wanting to \\"get a good black female up on screen in that genre\\". By the end of the month, Prince- Bythewood was still working on the script, explaining that \\"it all starts with the script. You gotta have a great script so we want to make sure that's right before we jump in.\\" Shortly after, at the start of June, Sony removed the film from its February 2019 release date and began actively looking for a new date to release the film which could accommodate the new re-writes and delayed production start. Discussing her role as director of the pilot episode for Marvel's Cloak & Dagger series, Prince-Bythewood said in June 2018 that she was excited to have entered the Marvel world and learned by doing \\"such cool, innovative things\\" with Marvel Television which she could then apply to the \\"bigger sandbox\\" of the films. She reiterated her commitment to \\"telling a good story\\" which is why she decided to delay filming until she was happy with the script. The director added that she may begin production on a different project before filming Silver & Black if the script is still not ready; a month later, she signed on to direct another comic book adaptation, The Old Guard, which was set to begin filming by the end of 2018. After placing her work for Silver & Black on hold, Prince-Bythewood ultimately took two years to develop and complete The Old Guard. The director later attributed her success with The Old Guard to her work on Silver & Black, believing that she only got the chance to direct the former because of the time she spent on the latter, and adding that she learned a lot of lessons about making a big budget film while developing Silver & Black which she was able to apply to the making of The Old Guard. ==Cancellation and future== In August 2018, Sony officially canceled Silver & Black, with the intention to instead rework the project as two separate solo films focusing on each of the title characters. An official decision had not been made at the time, but Prince-Bythewood was not expected to direct either of the new films. A month later, Tolmach was asked about the progress of the Silver & Black project and did not acknowledge the decision by Sony to cancel and rework the film, simply saying that they were \\"still working on the script\\". A solo film focused on Black Cat was expected first, as Sony believed she was \\"enough of her own character with a great backstory and a canon of material to draw from to justify her own film.\\" That would be followed by a Silver Sable film. Prince-Bythewood would remain involved as a producer, and Sony was adamant that she would be replaced with another female director. Sony Pictures Entertainment chairman Tony Vinciquerra revealed in March 2019 that the Sony Pictures Universe of Marvel Characters would be expanding to television with a set of Marvel characters developed specifically by Sony Pictures Television, and a network partner yet-to-be-determined. By January 2020, one of these series was believed to be a version of Silver & Black. Prince-Bythewood confirmed this in April 2020, explaining that first the two characters were going to be in a film together before a decision was made by Sony to split the two characters into their own films, and then another decision had been made to tell their story with a potential limited series which she suggested could be released on Disney+. Prince-Bythewood stated that her preference would be to include both characters in a single feature film, and she still hoped to be able to make that film one day. Prince-Bythewood stated in July 2020 that she would return to discussions with Sony about Silver & Black following the release of The Old Guard that month. She added that she wanted the film to be \\"edgier\\" than other Marvel films, saying, \\"It was a question of how far could I push it in that Marvel universe.\\" She also felt that they had devised an organic reason for having Black Cat and Silver Sable together in a film during her work on the script, and she wanted to keep the two characters together. Discussing the impact of the successful Spider-Man films on the project, Prince-Bythewood said, \\"There's a question of, 'Can you really have these films with Spider-Man not in them?'\\" ==See also== * List of unproduced Marvel Comics projects * List of unproduced films based on Marvel Imprints ==References== Category:Cancelled films Category:Sony Pictures Universe of Marvel Characters ","title":"Silver &amp; Black (unproduced film)"},{"id":"54114327","text":"The final flag of the East India Company, from 1801 onward The flag of the East India Company was used to represent the East India Company, which was chartered in England in 1600. The flag was altered as the nation changed from England to Great Britain to the United Kingdom. It was initially a red and white striped ensign with the flag of England in the canton. The flag displayed in the canton was later replaced by the flag of Great Britain and then the flag of the United Kingdom, as the nation developed. == Early years == The flag of the Company with the flag of England in the canton Variant with thirteen stripes The pattern was already common in South East Asia where the Company first operated, influenced by the Majapahit empire. Upon receiving a Royal Charter to trade in the Indian Ocean from Queen Elizabeth I in 1600, the English East India Company adopted a flag of red and white stripes (varying from nine to thirteen stripes in total), with the flag of England in the canton. It was reported that the number of stripes was chosen because many of the East India Company's shareholders were Freemasons, and the number thirteen is considered powerful in Freemasonry. However, different reports gave varying initial numbers of stripes. Given the Company's initial focus on the Spice Islands, there is unconfirmed speculation that the flag was based on local flags which were ultimately derived from the Majapahit Empire in modern-day Indonesia. The flag caused problems for the East India Company at first when trading in the Far East, because of its use of the Saint George's Cross. In Japan in 1616, the Company's ships were turned away because the cross on the flag was viewed as a symbol of Christianity, which the Japanese had banned in 1614. The Lê dynasty in Tonkin banned the Company from using the flag, believing the cross on it to be an endorsement of Christianity, promotion of which the Tonkinese had prohibited. The Company's trading rivals, the Dutch East India Company, argued on the Company's behalf that the cross was a symbol of the English nation and not of Christianity, but the Tonkinese insisted on banning the flying of the flag unless the cross was removed. In 1673, when the Company attempted to restart trade with Japan, they initially declared they would not change their flag. However, after receiving local advice and a demand for an explanation from the Japanese authorities, the Company began using a flag with red and white stripes, but without the flag of England on it, for trading in the Far East. In 1682 in Batavia, Dutch East Indies (modern-day Jakarta), the Company flag was at the centre of tensions between the English and Dutch governments after soldiers from the Dutch East India Company were accused of tearing down one of the Company flags. Although the Dutch sent warships to reinforce the area, the event came to nothing, as the person making the accusation was not present on Batavia, and neither the Company directors nor King Charles II of England had any desire to enter into a military conflict with the Dutch over the matter. == Great Britain == The flag of the Company with the flag of Great Britain in the canton In 1603, when King James VI of Scotland ascended to the English throne, thus unifying the Crowns of England and Scotland, he created a combined flag of both nations, to be used for a united British state. However, the Parliament of England and Parliament of Scotland were reluctant to unite, and wished that the countries remain separate. The king retained his flag for personal use as the King's Colours.A.C. Fox-Davies, The Art of Heraldry: An Encyclopædia of Armory (1904), p. 399 The East India Company continued using their ensign with the flag of England in the canton. In 1668, King Charles II transferred control of Bombay to the East India Company. The Company then adopted a new flag including the King's Colours, as was shown when blue cloth, in addition to red and white, was requested for making a new flag for the fort in Bombay \\"if the King’s colours were to be kept there; 'if not, white and red will be sufficient'”. The King's Colours were later formally adopted as the flag of Great Britain when the Kingdom of Great Britain was formed by the Acts of Union 1707 at the behest of Queen Anne.  Comparison with American flag  The Grand Union Flag, 1775 The flag of the East India Company is considered to have inspired the 1775 Grand Union Flag, the first flag of the United States, as the two flags were of the same design. This connection is attributed to numerous sources. Benjamin Franklin of Pennsylvania once gave a speech endorsing the adoption of the Company's flag by the United States as their national flag. He said to George Washington of Virginia, \\"While the field of your flag must be new in the details of its design, it need not be entirely new in its elements. There is already in use a flag, I refer to the flag of the East India Company.\\" This was a way of symbolising American loyalty to the Crown as well as the United States' aspirations to be self-governing, as was the East India Company. Some colonists also felt that the Company could be a powerful ally in the American War of Independence, as they shared similar aims and grievances against the British government tax policies. Colonists therefore flew the Company's flag, to endorse the Company. However, the theory that the Grand Union Flag was a direct descendant of the flag of the East India Company has been criticised as lacking written evidence. On the other hand, the resemblance is obvious, and a number of the Founding Fathers of the United States were aware of the East India Company's activities and of their free administration of India under Company rule. == United Kingdom == In 1801, following the unification of Great Britain and the Kingdom of Ireland into the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, the Union Flag was changed to incorporate Saint Patrick's Saltire. Accordingly, the flag of the East India Company was updated to display the new flag in the canton. In 1858, the British government passed the Government of India Act 1858, nationalising the East India Company and taking over all of their possessions within India, where they would be considered legally a part of the British Raj. Company rule in India thus ended, and the Company flag ceased to have official status. == Gallery == File:British East India Company Flag from Downman.jpgDownman (1685) File:British East India Company Flag from Lens.jpgLens (1700) File:British East India Company Flag from Rees.jpgRees (1820) File:British East India Company Flag from Laurie.jpgLaurie (1842) == See also == *Symbols of the East India Company *Star of India (flag) *Historical flags of the British Empire and the overseas territories == References  External links == Category:British East India Company East India Category:Flags with crosses Category:British India Category:1858 disestablishments in the British Empire Category:History of India ","title":"Flag of the East India Company"},{"id":"54114328","text":"Francis Edward Parnell Baker (July 11, 1884 – April 28, 1959Hockey deaths - April 1959) was a Canadian professional ice hockey player.

However, in 1995 serious financial issues arose when the sale of its old factories was delayed and the main contractor for the new building ran away with money for renovation. Pregnant with her first child, Jocelyn had to work long hours pausing only to deliver her child and then returning to work immediately. It was only in 1998 that they started exporting their sauces. Chng's husband would often help her with the sauce business and accompany her on overseas F&B; trade fairs. Through these trade fairs, he saw the potential of ready to eat meals and hot food vending machine. In 2001, together with her husband, Chng started JR Foodstuff. In 2008, Chng turned her attention to growing JR groups. She explained, “I felt that the time was right because people’s perception of chilled and frozen food had changed. People used to buy freshly slaughtered poultry from the wet market but by then, they knew that chilled and frozen meat sold in supermarkets is safer, fresher.” In 2016, under Chng's leadership, JR group opened the world's first Vendcafe serving hot meals in Singapore. It is an automatic and unmanned vending machine cafe. == Awards == * Women Entrepreneur of the Year 2001, organised by ASME * Montblanc Businesswomen Award 2003 * Work-Life Achiever Award 2005 * NUS Centennial Entrepreneur Award, Arts & Social Science and SDE of Year 2005 * Recipient of NUS Eminent Alumni Award 2016 * 2018 EY Entrepreneurial Winning Women Asia Pacific Program. == Community Work == Sponsored President’s Challenge in Soccer Mania 2002 Sponsored Red Pocket Culinary Challenge 2002 == Personal life == In 1997, Chng married Richard Wong.

At the Hong Kong International Airport where he was speaking to the press, he was shot thrice by a mysterious woman (Hisako Shirata) who emerged from the crowd. As havoc ensues in the airport, Special Forces superintendent Charles Cheung (Simon Yam), whose squad was in charge of protecting Yung, gives chase to the woman who eventually falls down a building as loses her memory. This assassination attempt at the airport caused a great shock to the Hong Kong police and CID chief inspector Tim Yiu (Alex Fong) was sent to assist Cheung in the investigation. After investigation, the assassin, named Jade, belongs to an international terrorist organization. According to the information, Jade was born into a happy family in Japan, but at the age of three, she was abducted by the leader of the terrorist group, Otosan (Sonny Chiba), where she was brainwashed and trained to become an elite assassin. For this assassination attempt, she snuck into airport as a reporter in order to get close to her target. While the Hong Kong police was spending great efforts solving the case, Otosan also secretly leads his organization into Hong Kong as he was unsatisfied with the previous assassination and plans to take action himself. Under his command, his underlings murder Yiu's wife, Monica (Chan Lik), and kidnap his son, Joe (Jacky Wong), in order to blackmail Yiu to killing Jade. Yiu helplessly executes Otosan's command and shoots and hijacks Jade, who was wearing a bulletproof vest, when she was being escorted by his team of CID, leading him to become a wanting criminal. While avoiding being hunted by the police, Yiu also struggles to find the whereabouts of Otosan to save his kidnapped son. While on the process of pursuing Otosan with Yiu, Jade gradually regains her memory and reveals to Yiu that Otosan has planted a mole in the police force - Cheung. However, Yiu and Jade were puzzled by the question of why Cheung did not carry out the assassination of Yung since he was in charge of protecting him for his stay in Hong Kong but Jade was chosen instead. ==Cast== *Simon Yam as Superintendent Charles Cheung *Alex Fong as Chief Inspector Tim Yiu *Hisako Shirata as Jade *Sonny Chiba as Otosan *Edwin Siu as Jack Chan *Crystal Kwok as Ada Chan *Samuel Pang as Glen *Eddy Ko as Police Commander Fung *Lam Suet as Mendosa *Joe Cheung as Senior Officer Kent Yung *Alexander Chan as Officer Ken Ma *Zac Ko as Motoki *Wong Mei-yin as Tina *Chan Man-lei as Uncle Suen *Lee Lam-yan as Marco *Roderick Lam as Ken *Johnnie Guy as Ronald Smith *Law Yau-kuen as Kent Yung's secretary *Jacky Wong as Joe *Mark Le Gartha as Basung Kawoma *Mark Zetterlund as Luther *Murata Hiroki as Daiki *Ho Sze-ting as Lina *Chan Lik as Monica *Lau Ching- lam as Hoko Mart *Kamiyama Norihisa as Jade's father *Risa Kosetsuki as Jade's mother *Lam Kwok-kit as Smith's bodyguard *Rick Smith as Macau official *Kawoma as Ahmed *Alan Ng as Glen's man *Benjamin Yuen as Glen's man *Suzuki Taukya as Otosan's man *Nishimura Shin as Otosan's man *Paul Logan as Otosan's man *Lau Tin-lung as Otosan's man *Luk Chun-kwong as Otosan's man *Alex Cheng as Otosan's man *Pang Wai-ming as Tom's subordinate *fong Chi-kui as Tom's subordinate *Woo Shui-chuen as Tom's subordinate *Lau Hing-kuen as Tom's subordinate *Adam Chan as Charles's subordinate *Vincent Chik as Charles's subordinate *Lee Miu-mak as Charles's subordinate *Wong Chun-man as Otosan's bodyguard *Tony Lui as Priest *John Cheung as Neurologist treating Jade *Ng Kim-wai as Underground doctor *Che Kim-fai as Macau's special force *Luk Man- wai as Macau's special force *Eddie Che as Macau's special force *Wong Ho-kwan as Macau's special force *Wong Kin-chung as Macau's special force *Cheng Wai- kei as Airport police *Yip Seung-hung as Airport police *Victy Wong as Special force driver *Lui Siu-ming as Special force driver *Joyce as Newscaster *Hon Ping ==Reception== Critical Andrew Chan of the Film Critics Circle of Australia rated the film a score of 8.75/10 and praised the film's plot and acting and director Sam Leong's original use of camera angles and shots.

Before coming to Christianity Today, he edited the magazine Campus Life. He is the author, co-author, or editor of multiple books in a variety of genres, including speculative fiction, children's books, and non-fiction. == Campus Life == Myra joined Youth For Christ Magazine as an associate editor in 1961, shortly after graduating from college, and was appointed the editor of the publication in 1965. Soon after the name of the magazine was changed to Campus Life. Myra quickly improved the art direction and diversified the subject coverage of the magazine for a more professional-looking publication with four-color covers and more photographs. Under his editorship, the magazine shifted from being primarily a house organ for the Youth For Christ organization to a general interest teen magazine for Christians. Campus Life became a major advertising venue for Christian Colleges. During Myra's tenure, the circulation grew from 30,000 to 160,000. == Christianity Today == In 1975 at the age 35, Myra moved from Campus Life to become the president and publisher of Christianity Today, which had come close to bankruptcy in the early 1970s following an unsuccessful venture into book publishing. Within three years, Myra had led the magazine to become a profitable enterprise through changes such as raising subscription prices, cutting unpaid circulation, and moving the headquarters of the publication from Washington, D.C. to Carol Stream, Illinois. Myra thought that the health of the magazine depended on the effective functioning of three key areas of operation: editorial, circulation, and advertising. Beginning in 1980, Christianity Today expanded its stable of publications by founding or acquiring other magazines, growing to a \\"family\\" of as many as 13 periodicals. It also experimented with other media, including a subscription service of sermons delivered on audio cassettes. In the mid-1990s, Christianity Today launched its online presence as a content provider for America Online. Lyle Schaller called CTI under Myra's leadership \\"one of the most remarkable success stories in American Christianity during the second half of the 20th century.\\" Myra retired from Christianity Today in 2007. == Books == Myra is the author of five novels, multiple children's books, poetry, and nonfiction. == Honors and awards == * Honorary doctorates: Biola University, Gordon College. * James Deforest Murch Award from the National Association of Evangelicals * Joseph T.

Original elements of the dairy farm have been retained, including two red- brick barns. Many vernacular features of the farm buildings have also been reinterpreted such as the metallic roofs and oak shutters. The complex was built using environmentally sustainable design principles. It has grey water recycling and ground source heating. The shutters allow natural ventilation and the deep eaves protect offices from the sun. It is also one of Britain’s largest naturally-cooled archives as the stores have thick walls which create a stable environment without the use of air-conditioning. == Art == There is a growing contemporary art collection which includes sculpture by Sarah Lucas, Angus Fairhurst, and Richard Long in the grounds around the building.

The building was commissioned by Jacob Rothschild, 4th Baron Rothschild, and completed in 2015, winning that year's RIBA House of the Year Award. The architect was Charlotte Skene Catling, a partner of Skene Catling de la Peña. The stones for the exterior were hand knapped by master flint knapper, John Lord, in Norfolk. The interiors were decorated and furnished by David Mlinaric, using an eclectic mix of modern contemporary pieces and older items from the Rothschild collection. The ethos of the house is that it blends and harmonises with the surrounding landscape and environment. The site chosen for the house, is an isolated spot at the heart of the Waddesdon estate in open countryside surrounded by grass pastures and arable fields. It can be accessed only by a narrow unmetalled track. While the house is only a few hundred metres from its nearest neighbours, the new Rothschild Archive building and a farm cottage, a fold in the landscape prevents sight of another building from the house and enhances the sense of isolation and of being as one with nature. The house has been described by its architect as \\"jutting from the ground like a collision of tectonic plates\\".Skene Catling de la Pena Retrieved 23 August 2018. The house was given to the Rothschild Foundation, and is used to accommodate visitors including academics and artists working on projects at Waddesdon Manor, and the Rothschild Getty Fellow when at Waddesdon. It can be visited by arrangement at certain times. ==Architecture== A play of light and space is created by varying ceiling heights and vistas During initial surveys of the site, it was discovered that it sat directly above the seam of chalk which runs from Kent to Norfolk; this inspired the architect to use flint (a sediment of chalk) and limestone as the principal building materials. Dezeem Mini-Living by Amy Frearson Retrieved 23 August 2018 Despite an abundance of the stone lying naturally on the Waddesdon estate, it was decided to use stone sourced from quarries in Norfolk. The knapped flints were then graded into six almost imperceptible shades, to create bands of colour in the walls, changing from the darkest flint at ground level to the lightest chalk at roof level. This seemingly naturally occurring colour scheme of stone creates an artful illusion of the building blending into the frequently grey skyscape against which it stands.Dezeem Mini-Living by Amy Frearson Retrieved 23 August 2018 The flints were hand knapped by master flint knapper John Lord who used an ancient technique used to craft square section hand axes, originating in prehistoric Denmark. The house is furnished with many contemporary works of art belonging to Lord Rothschild The long rectangular structure is designed with an unusual stepped roof which rises from the ground to the full height of the building, creating wedge- shaped side elevations. The plan is long and thin, in places only one room wide. The triangular shape of the building also resembles a flint. The interior of the house contains an open-plan ground floor with the kitchen being the centre of what is almost an enfilade, which includes a dining room, small sitting room, and a drawing room, beyond which is a study. The study takes as its inspiration the Baron's Room at nearby Waddesdon Manor, where the private study of Baron Ferdinand de Rothschild contains a small spiral staircase leading to his bedroom directly above; at the Flint House, the study too contains a steep spiral staircase leading directly to the principal bedroom. The upper floor also contains two further bedrooms. Each of the three bedrooms has a small adjoining bathroom with a sunken bath. Each of the bedrooms has its own private roof terrace almost hidden in the stepped roof. Throughout the design, the elements of water, air and fire have been used to create an animation to the plan and reinforce the sense of nature: Air is created by the use of double height spaces and abundance of large windows which not only light the house, but bring the landscape within. Water is used to create a sense of fluidity and reflection: A small stream running near the house, has been diverted to run through and around the building before flowing to a nearby pool. The stream has been further enhance by small dams which limit and adjust the flow of water, from an imperceptibly slow flowing rill to a more agitated, fast flowing stream. In one recessed corner of the house, the stream forms a pool around which a glazed flint grotto, illuminated by small led lights, has been designed. While inside the house the water is visible through a glass floor which seems to create a bridge from the drawing room. Fire is reflected through a glass panel at the rear of the drawing room fireplace into the pool of the grotto at its rear. The house has a small annex designed in the same style; this is completely detached from the main house, but linked to it through an architectural scheme which presents a visual avenue flowing from the top of the stepped roof down the ground and then transforming into a rising stepped grass path leading the annex. The annex itself is a smaller version of the main house intended for staff or guests. ==Grounds== The grounds and distant annex, viewed from the highest point of the stepped roof The house rises directly from a contrived, but seemingly natural, tangled wilderness of indigenous grasses and wild flowers. The stepped design of the roof incorporates small rectangular pockets which have been designed to be easily colonised by indigenous plants seeding naturally on the wind; this, in time, combined with the naturally occurring mosses and, in time, weather-worn stone steps of the roof will further permit the building to blend and be absorbed by the landscape.

She obtained her tertiary qualifications from the University of Belgrade: Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering (1972), Master of Science (1978) and Doctor of Philosophy in Telecommunications (1982). Vucetic has held academic positions in Serbia, United Kingdom, Australia and China. She is Fellow of the IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers), a former Editor of the IEEE Transactions on Communications, a Fellow of the Australian Academy of Science, and a Fellow of the Australian Academy of Technological Sciences and Engineering. == Work == Vucetic's current work is in the area of wireless networks and the internet of things. In the area of wireless networks she explores the possibilities of millimetre wave (mmWave) frequency bands. Considering that microwave bands below 6 GHz have already been heavily used, she and her team are exploring opportunities afforded by the mmWave frequency band. They believe that utilisation of the unused spectrum between 30 GHz and 300 GHz will be the foundation of the next revolution in wireless communication. Vucetic \\"is working with her team on developing a fundamental theoretical framework and advanced signal processing and network protocols for mmWave systems\\". In the area of the internet of things, Vucetic works on extending wireless connectivity for mission critical applications such as \\"automated power grids, information exchange between vehicles and supporting cloud infrastructure for detecting safety-critical situations, such as black ice, vehicle accident minimisation and adaptation to road conditions, remotely controlled and self-driven vehicles and remote robot-assisted surgeries\\". She is also investigating mechanisms for delivering power to devices by using micro and mmWave radiation, which would considerably extend battery life without a need for power cables and chargers. Vucetic has published hundreds of journal articles and four books. == Awards and honours == * 2014 - Chinese Government Friendship Award * 2015 - Fellow of the Australian Academy of Technological Sciences and Engineering * 2016 - ARC Georgina Sweet Australian Laureate Fellowship * 2017 - Fellow of the Australian Academy of Science * 2018 - New South Wales Premier's Prize for Science and Engineering * 2019 - CSIRO Eureka Prize for Leadership in Innovation and Science, awarded by the Australian Museum == See also == * Internet of things * Mobile technology * Wireless network * Wireless == References == Category:Recipients of grants or fellowships from the Australian Research Council Category:Living people Category:Australian engineers Category:Serbian engineers Category:Serbian women engineers Category:Fellow Members of the IEEE Category:Fellows of the Australian Academy of Science Category:Fellows of the Australian Academy of Technological Sciences and Engineering Category:21st-century women engineers Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Branka Vucetic"},{"id":"54114963","text":"ca:Hipopotomonstrosesquipedaliofòbia et:Hipopotomonstroseskvipedaliofoobia gl:Hipopotomonstrosesquipedaliofobia pt:Hipopotomonstrosesquipedaliofobia tl:Hippopotomonstrosesquipedaliophobia tr:Hippopotomonstrosesquippedaliophobia uk:Гіппопотомонстросескіпедалофобія Category:Long words ","title":"Hippopotomonstrosesquippedaliophobia"},{"id":"54114981","text":"Seyyed Morteza Hashemizadeh () is a retired Iranian Football player.

He was accused of collaborating with the Japanese during the Japanese occupation of Hong Kong. After the war, he ran for the Urban Council twice in 1952 and 1967 and was the secretary of the Labour Party of Hong Kong, a socialist self-government party. ==Biography== Kennedy-Skipton was born on 31 August 1898 in Cheltenham, England and was educated at Trinity College, Dublin. Aged 23 years, he traveled from Liverpool to Hong Kong on the blue funnel liner SS Pyrrhus on 31 December 1921 and joined the cadet service of the Hong Kong colonial government. He had served various departments, including District Officer, Magistrate, Senior Assistant Treasurer, Food Controller from 1940 to 1941 and secretary of the Sanitary Board. He was also a senior officer in the Secretariat for Chinese Affairs, in charge of the District Watch, labour affairs and Mui Tsai suppression. He was promoted Class 1 officer in January 1940 and was Chairman of the Urban Council in 1940. He married Helen Tow, an American woman of Scandinavian descent who was born to a Quaker family in Iowa on 15 October 1892. The couple had two daughters, Anne Laetitia Daphne (b. 1930) and Enid Conolly (b. 1933). He had also a Chinese mistress and a son named Kimmy S. Kennedy-Skipton (later known as Henry). Before the Battle of Hong Kong where Hong Kong was fallen into Japanese hand in December 1941, Helen appealed to the Evacuation Advisory Committee against the compulsory evacuation order, which caused a heated exchange between Attorney General Sir Grenville Alabaster, Colonial Secretary Franklin Gimson and Kennedy-Skipton at the Prince's Building. After the British surrender, Kennedy-Skipton lived with his family at his residence at No. 565 The Peak at the far end of Middle Gap Road. He was not interned like the rest of the colonial administrators as he claimed Irish nationality and he had also agreed to help the Japanese with the administration of night-soil collection, storage and conversion for use as a fertilizer for farmers in the New Territories among other things. For that he was accused of collaborating with the Japanese including the British Army Aid Group which reported that he had \\"gone over to the Japanese\\". He was sacked by Colonial Secretary Franklin Gimson in the Executive Council on 11 February 1942 for disobeying orders to cease cooperating with the Japanese and refusing to report to the Stanley Camp for internment with other government officials. For the next ten years, Kennedy-Skipton tried to appeal the decision, to clear his name and seek compensation for salary foregone. In January 1943 Kennedy- Skipton escaped to Free China leaving his wife and two children in occupied Hong Kong until they were repatriated to the United Kingdom following liberation on the SS Highland Monarch arriving in Southampton on 9 November 1945, while George Stacey returned in Hong Kong in 1947. He defended himself in a private enquiry in 1948. A newspaper criticised the fact that the enquiry was held closed-door under the title of \\"The Strange Case of Mr. Kennedy- Skipton\\". He went on to the Court of Appeal which dismissed his case in 1951. Kennedy-Skipton remained in Hong Kong and taught at Diocesan Boys School and later St Joan of Arc private school. He ran in the 1952 Urban Council election but failed to win a seat. He was a member of the executive committee of the Democratic Self-Government Party of Hong Kong, the first political party calling for self-government and Hong Kong independence. In 1964, he formed the Labour Party of Hong Kong with other Democratic Self-Government Party members such as Tang Hon-tsai and K. Hopkin-Jenkins, a socialist party which called for self-government and common ownership, and became the party secretary. He ran again in the 1967 Urban Council election for the Labour Party was again not elected. He returned to United Kingdom in the 1970s and died in Scotland in 1982 at the age of 84. ==References== Category:1898 births Category:1982 deaths Category:Alumni of Trinity College Dublin Category:Members of the Urban Council of Hong Kong Category:Hong Kong educators Category:Hong Kong civil servants Category:Labour Party of Hong Kong politicians Category:Democratic Self-Government Party of Hong Kong politicians Category:Hong Kong people of Irish descent Category:People from Cheltenham Category:Hong Kong collaborators with Imperial Japan ","title":"G.

Extending from Trinity College in the north to Cedar Hill Cemetery in the south, the streetscape typifies the city's development between about 1890 and 1930, a period of growth along the road fueled by the rise of streetcars. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984. ==Description and history== Fairfield Avenue is a historically old road, running generally southerly along a ridge south from downtown Hartford that parallels the general course of the Connecticut River. Until the mid-19th century, it was a rural agricultural area, with an open landscape affording views of the river valley. The view made the area attractive for development, as the city's growing upper class sought places to build country estates after the American Civil War. George Fairfield, a former executive at the Colt Armory, was one of the first to do so, building a fine Second Empire house here in 1866 that stands at 160 Fairfield Avenue. Fairfield was influential in shaping the later development of the area, and the street was given his name by 1870. Several other high-style homes were built along the avenue, but it was the arrival of streetcar service in 1890 that prompted a greater development push.NRHP nomination for Fairfield Street Historic District, part 1, part 2 The historic district is bounded on the north by the campus of Trinity College and Hyland Park, and the south by Cedar Hill Cemetery, but excludes the college campus and cemetery. Most of the properties are residential; Hyland Park is the largest exception, and there is one church, the Memorial Baptist Church. It is one of seven buildings in the district credited to builder Newton Clark, its most prolific contributor. Most of the street's housing was built between then and 1930, and is in styles popular to the period. ==See also== *National Register of Historic Places listings in Hartford, Connecticut ==References== Category:Historic districts in Hartford County, Connecticut Category:Colonial Revival architecture in Connecticut Category:Geography of Hartford, Connecticut Category:National Register of Historic Places in Hartford, Connecticut Category:Historic districts on the National Register of Historic Places in Connecticut ","title":"Fairfield Avenue Historic District (Hartford, Connecticut)"},{"id":"54115417","text":"Malashe ka Khawuta (born late 1700s) was the younger son of King Khawuta and a younger brother of King Hintsa and Chief Bhurhu.

He grew up in North London and lived there until the age of 10 and then moved to Essex, but now lives in Hertfordshire. Eagle enjoyed photography, so he considered this as a career path but instead spent three years as a ski instructor. At age 22, he decided to change careers again and moved to the city to become a commodity broker. He next became a foreign exchange dealer, then went into bonds trading before he became a headhunter for seven years. He then went into fund management and then finally acquiring stock brokers SP Bell. == Market abuse == In May 2010, the Financial Services Authority fined Eagle £2.8m - the largest ever for an individual - for deliberate market abuse and banned him from working in financial services. The FSA said Eagle was responsible for a complex and prolonged abusive scheme that deliberately set out to ramp up the share price of Fundamental-E Investments (FEI) for his own benefit. == Charity work == Eagle has recently set up a new charity called Escape C22 which is to help homeless people. The basis of the charity is to offer homeless people the chance to live and work on a rural farm. This will provide them with a permanent address, through which they can gain work experience, receive career advice and references enabling them to seek future employment and start rebuilding their lives. They will be offered the opportunity to grow their own food, receive counseling and social rehabilitation. The theme is to escape the \\"catch 22\\" of their situation. The money raised would be used to rent a farm, buy minibuses to pick up homeless people and take them to their new home (the farms) where they will embark on this new opportunity. The charity would look to work with food retailers, existing food banks and any other sources of help and care who could assist in giving much needed help to this charity. The crowdfunding was a success and raised a total of £40.http://www.crowdfunder.co.uk/escape-c22 ==References== Category:1958 births Category:Living people Category:English stockbrokers ","title":"Simon Eagle"},{"id":"54115519","text":"The Greek League for Women's Rights () is a Greek feminist organization which was founded in 1920 in Athens to promote women's political rights including suffrage. Affiliated to the International Alliance of Women, the organization continues to be active today. ==Background== A number of initiatives in support of women had been taken since Greece had obtained independence in 1828, especially in the sphere of education. In 1872, Kalliopi Kehajia (1839-1905) founded the Society for Promoting Women's Education. Kalliroi Parren (1861-1940) founded the Union for the Emancipation of Women in 1894 and the Union of Greek Women in 1896, although both avoided calls for the controversial cause of women's suffrage. The National Council of Greek Women, an umbrella organization for some fifty charity associations for women and children, was founded in 1911. Progress on the educational front was achieved with the admission of women to the University of Athens and in 1911, the establishment of the Lyceum of Greek Women (Lykeion ton Ellinidon), an association striving to revive Greece's glorious past. It was only in 1920 that Avra Theodoropoulou founded the Greek League for Women's Rights, specifically demanding progress on political rights and suffrage. ==History== The League was particularly active in the 1920s, 1930s and 1950s, succeeding in having discriminating laws repealed and achieving progress in family law. In 1982, it established the Centre for Documentation and Study of Women's Problems. The feminist journal Women's Struggle has been published by the organization since 1923, the year when it became affiliated with the International Alliance of Women. ==ReferencesExternal links== *The League's website (in Greek) Category:Feminist organizations in Greece Category:Organizations established in 1920 Category:Voter rights and suffrage organizations ","title":"Greek League for Women's Rights"},{"id":"54115528","text":"Brian Savoy (born January 13, 1992) is an Argentine-born Swiss professional basketball player.

The year's total was greater than 2007's 633 summiters, the previous yearly record. In 2013, Yuichiro Miura became the oldest person to reach the summit, at age 80.

Phurba Tashi completed his 21st summit in May, a total equal to the record held by Apa Sherpa. ==Assault on climbers== On 27 April, three climbers were attacked by a group of 100 Sherpas at elevation. The event was seen as an aberration in the otherwise decades-long spirit of teamwork and friendship on the mountain. Earlier in the day, the three European climbers on the Lhotse Face had crossed over lines being laid by the Sherpas, contrary to the etiquette that climbers should avoid Sherpas working on the mountain. Words were exchanged and the situation escalated. An ice pick was brandished and ice and stones were thrown. The Sherpas then left the Lhotse Face, but later visited the camp site with about 100 others and threatened to kill one of the three climbers. The climber was upset because he considered himself a friend of the Sherpa community, had built a school for nearly 400 Sherpa children, and also had funded free evacuations via helicopters for Sherpas. The Nepalese government said if climbers were attacked, action would be taken against the aggressors. An official from the Nepal tourism ministry described the attack as a misunderstanding that had been sorted out and pledged to ensure the safety of climbers. The three ringleaders of the attack were removed from the mountain. Sherpas are renowned for the most part for their climbing skill and demeanour, with one Everest climber noting, \\"To a man everyone seems to be absolutely impressed with the Sherpas. Not just their strength on the mountain, which is legendary, but their personalities and their friendliness. They become your friends.\\" The fight led to improved communication between the people on the mountain, which helped to overcome the cultural and language barriers that complicated an already difficult environment. ==Fatalities== There were 8 fatalities attributed to mountaineering. One of the losses was the well-known and respected Russian climber, Alexi Bolotov, who died in the Khumbu Icefall when the rope he was rappelling down broke. ==References== Category:Mount Everest Category:2013 in Nepal Category:History of mountaineering ","title":"Mount Everest in 2013"},{"id":"54115580","text":"En Magal () is a 1954 Indian Tamil-language film directed by K.

Alvarado, a Hispanic girl, resided in the East End. On January 18, 2002, she disappeared after leaving her boyfriend's house. Alvarado was kidnapped, raped, and murdered by the three perpetrators; she was shot in the head. Her body was placed in a field, in an industrial zone on the block of 18000 Market Street. Her body was discovered on Tuesday January 22, 2002. The other murder victims, 24-year old Roxana Aracelie Capulin and 38-year old Maria Moreno Rangel, were waitresses, employed at the El Mirador restaurant, an East End establishment acquired by Capulin's family in 1994. Capulin's family had immigrated from El Salvador. On May 31, 2002, the two women disappeared and on July 1, their corpses were found in Capulin's vehicle. They had been shot to death and had their eyes and mouths covered with tape. ==Perpetrators== Cubas, an illegal immigrant, originated from the San Miguel neighborhood of Tegucigalpa, Honduras and worked at a shopping center in the Comayagüela area. He left his hometown in 2000. Cubas had a common law wife from Houston, and his father was also resident in Houston. Cubas supported himself by cleaning offices and installing insulation. He did not previously have a criminal record. Sorto, also an illegal immigrant, had been convicted of unlawfully carrying a weapon in 1999 and for committing aggravated robbery with a deadly weapon. For the former, he received a 10-day jail sentence, and for the latter, he received a sentence of probation for ten years in December 2000. Sorto was married and had children. The teenage boy was enrolled in Daniel Ortiz, Jr. Middle School as an 8th grader before his arrest. ==Trial and punishment== The adult perpetrators are housed in the Polunsky Unit Sorto entered a police station in an attempt to claim a reward for solving the crimes. He confessed to committing crimes after his arrest. On the day of Sorto's arrest, the teenage boy was arrested at his residence. Cubas was arrested while on the job at a construction site in Tomball, Texas. Gilberto Villarreal, one of Cubas's lawyers, stated that in addition to Alvarado, Cubas also confessed to killing Capulin. Prosecutors sought the death penalty for Sorto and Cubas. Navarro was under 18 years of age at the time of the crimes, and therefore was ineligible for the death penalty. Navarro served as the getaway driver during the deaths of Capulin and Rangel. He was to be tried as an adult. In November 2003 Sorto was sentenced to death for the murders of Capulin and Rangel. Frances \\"Poppy\\" Northcutt and Villarreal were Cubas's defense attorneys. During his trial, seven of Cubas's relatives traveled to Houston to provide testimony; they were residents of Honduras. Cubas was convicted of the capital murder of Alvarado on May 10, 2004. He was sentenced to death on May 22, 2004 after the jury deliberated for two and one half hours. Male death row inmates in Texas are housed in the Polunsky Unit in West Livingston. Cubas's execution was originally scheduled for January 16, 2014, but the execution date was rescinded. ==ReferencesExternal links== * Court of Criminal Appeals of Texas.

She was noted for her missions in Lebanon and work for the Mossad. ==Biography== Kishik-Cohen was born in Argentina, immigrated to Mandatory Palestine as a child, and grew up in the Mekor Baruch neighborhood in Jerusalem. She studied at the Evelina de Rothschild School. At the age of 16, she married a Lebanese-Jewish merchant named Yosef. The couple lived in Wadi Abu Jamil, the Jewish quarter in Beirut and raised seven children. Her son, Itzhak Levanon, is an Israeli diplomat who was Israel's ambassador to Egypt. In Beirut, she began working in the local Jewish community and even established contacts with the authorities. Throughout Lebanon, Jews were smuggled to Israel under the noses of the Lebanese authorities. At the beginning of the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, she transferred information about Lebanese military activity to the headquarters of the Haganah in Metulla. She continued her espionage activities without the knowledge of her family, sending her two older children to Israel for their own safety. Kishik-Cohen continued to gather intelligence from Lebanon and Syria from 1947 to 1961. She assisted the Mossad in bringing the Jews of Lebanon and other Arab countries to Israel. Her Mossad codename was \\"The Pearl.\\" She was caught in 1952 and imprisoned for 36 days. In 1961, Kishik-Cohen was arrested by the Lebanese authorities. She was tortured and sentenced to death; in a later appeal her sentence was commuted to seven years' imprisonment. Her husband was also arrested and accused of knowing about his wife's activities. After the Six-Day War in 1967, Kishik-Cohen was released as part of the prisoner exchange deal. She smuggled her remaining family to Israel via Cyprus and resided in Jerusalem until her death in 2017. In 2007, on the 59th Independence Day of the State of Israel, Kishik-Cohen was selected to light a torch at the annual torchlighting ceremony. In 2010 she was awarded the title of Yakir Yerushalayim. In November 2011, she won the Dona Gracia Medal. Shulamit Kishik-Cohen died on 21 May 2017 at the age of 100, at Hadassah Medical Center in Jerusalem, at the Mount Scopus campus. == References == Category:1917 births Category:2017 deaths Category:People convicted of spying for Israel Category:People of the Mossad Category:Argentine Jews Category:Israeli people of Argentine-Jewish descent Category:Argentine emigrants to Israel Category:Israeli Jews Category:Israeli centenarians Category:Women centenarians ","title":"Shulamit Kishik-Cohen"},{"id":"54115704","text":"Chanon Santinatornkul (, born 6 June 1996), nicknamed Non and also known by the alias Nonkul, is a Thai actor.

Jean-Luc Delarue was the show's first host, from September 2006 to early September 2010. Then Sophie Davant took the helm and presented from September 2010 to June 2016. From 13 May 2013 onward, the show was made thirty minutes longer in order to include a new part called L'histoire continue, allowing the viewers to catch up on the guests who had appeared on set in the past. At the start of the next year, the two parts were split into two distinct shows, although broadcast successively. == Broadcast == The program was broadcast on France 2 from Monday to Friday from 2 to 3 p.m., followed by L’histoire continue starting from May 2013, broadcast from 3.10 to 3.40 p.m. The latter, derived from Toute une histoire, invited former guests to take stock of their progress. Every two months, special editions of Toute une histoire offered to bring back former guests to give news, before the spin-off L’histoire continue, essentially based on this concept, was established. For a while, the Wednesday show was dedicated to celebrities. During bank holidays and long weekends, reruns of Toute une histoire were available on the channel. Following the good ratings of 2011, the 24 May 2011, Sophie Davant hosted a special prime time, live on air from 8.40 to 10.35 pm, based on the theme \\"Couples of mixed nationalities: the fight for love\\". It was ranked third in the top of the evening’s ratings, behind TF1 and France 3 but in front of M6. , 25 May 2012. The show was also broadcast in Belgium on Club RTL from Monday to Friday (5.10 p.m.) and in Western Switzerland on RTS Un (1.15 p.m.). The show was always broadcast on France 2 one day after it had been broadcast on RTS Un, meaning that the latter was the first one to broadcast the new shows. In Canada, the show was broadcast from Monday to Friday at 11 a.m. on the TV5 Québec channel. On 16 April 2012, the opening credits of the show changed and were made longer with an extended jingle. The backstage area of the show still appeared on screen during the new credits, as it had before. From 13 May 2013 onward, Toute une histoire was extended with L’histoire continue in order to fill the void left in the channel by the canceled German serial Storm of Love. From the beginning of the 2014 school year, Toute une histoire and L’histoire continue became two distinct TV shows, although broadcast one after the other on the public channel. In 2016, the management of France Télévisions announced the end of the show’s production after 10 years on the air. Broadcast on 24 June 2016, the last show recounts the best moments with the most emblematic guests’ and specialists’ accounts. == Principle == Every day, the show broached various social themes: love, secrets, seduction, friendship, children, weight loss, relationships, break up, reunion, pregnancy, motherhood, fatherhood, lies, family, homosexuality, jealousy, parents, encounters, body issues, sexuality, single life, etc. During the program, several guests talked about their issues or adventures to Sophie Davant, who questioned them quite directly on the matter. Three or four guests were present every day. Interspersed with reports, the show was divided into two major parts written in the form of questions, which the participants and Sophie Davant (with sometimes a psychologist) tried to answer through a discussion. For each part, Sophie Davant questioned the guests one after the other in order. In the 8th season, in September 2013, the show used a new stage, bigger, brighter and red-orange colored. In September 2015, the stage changed again: the colored ambiance was now blue and yellow, whereas the guests’ and participants’ seats were reversed, with guests turning their back to the public. == Delarue replaced by Davant == On 15 September 2010, following Jean-Luc Delarue’s legal problems, the management of France Télévisions decided to remove the show from the France 2 schedule indefinitely. It was then replaced by Le Grenier de Sébastien, which was in turn replaced by Fait divers, le mag starting from 20 September 2016 due to bad ratings. On 27 September 2010, Sophie Davant was appointed in the interim to take the helm of the show., 20 September 2010 On 27 October 2010, the management of France Télévisions announced to her that she was now officially in charge. She has also presented the show C’est au programme every morning on France 2 from 9.50 to 10.50 since 7 September 1998. She went to the set of Toute une histoire twice per week to record three shows starting from 2 p.m. == Special edition == On 28 August 2012, in the second part of the evening at around 10:20pm, a special edition presented by Sophie Davant was broadcast live. It paid tribute to Jean-Luc Delarue, former showrunner of Toute une histoire, amongst others, and leading producer of French television, died on the night of 24 August 2012. The name of the show was changed for the occasion into Toute son histoire. The set was also decorated for the event. The program gave a retrospective of the presenter-producer's career by broadcasting numerous extracts. Among the many guests present on set to pay homage to him were Christophe Dechavanne, Rémy Pfimlin, Frédéric Mitteran, Daniela Lumbroso, Flioran Gazan, Flavie Flament and many more, as well as former guests of his shows, especially from Ça se discute. This special edition dedicated to Jean- Luc Delarue attracted 2,249,000 viewers, amounting to 18.9% of market share, making it a leader in this time slot from 11.15 p.m. onward. == External links == * Official website == References == Category:French reality television series ","title":"Toute une histoire"},{"id":"54115784","text":"Nasser Haji Mokhtar () is a retired Iranian midfielder who played for Iran national football team.

It is widely believed that ‘Practices cannot survive on their own – they have to look at ways of making themselves stronger.’ 15 sites were selected in December 2015 to test new enhanced primary care models serving populations of 30,000 to 50,000 patients. Some, but by no means all, clinical commissioning groups have given financial support to encourage the formation of federations. As the British Medical Association explains there are many names and many organisational forms: federations, networks, collaborations, joint ventures, alliances. By 2017 it appeared that GP Federations were the commonest titles for collaborative arrangements which fall short of full merger or partnerships. Both the BMA and the Royal College of General Practitioners were keen to support such developments, the RCGP having encouraged them since 2008. In January 2019 NHS England told clinical commissioning groups that they must establish primary care networks, typically covering 30-50,000 people, in their areas by 30 June. £1.50 per head of population per year is to be committed to ‘developing and maintaining’ them. The plan says networks 'will comprise a range of staff such as GPs, pharmacists, district nurses, community geriatricians, dementia workers and AHPs such as physiotherapists and podiatrists/chiropodists, joined by social care and the voluntary sector'. It is expected that the GP contract will be changed to require every practice to join one, and that all local enhanced services will be funded through the networks. ==Active federations== *Abingdon Health Federation * Barnsley Healthcare Federation *Bolton GP Federation *Brighton and Hove Integrated Care Service *Bury GP Federation \\\\- 30 of the town’s 33 General Practices *City and Hackney GP Confederation *Conexus Healthcare (Wakefield) *Coventry & Rugby GP Alliance *Croydon GP Collaborative *Durham Dales Health Federation *Ealing GP Federation *East Leicestershire and Rutland GP Federation * Encompass (Canterbury) *The Fareham & Gosport Primary Care Alliance Limited. *Fedbucks *GPCARE Services Ltd (Heywood, Middleton and Rochdale) * GP Healthcare Alliance Ltd (Essex) * GP Health Connect Ltd (Halton - Runcorn & Widnes) *Greater Peterborough Network Ltd *Hadrian Primary Care Alliance.

Oke was the great-grandson of Robert Oke (1794–1870), the first lighthouse inspector in Newfoundland, and the grandson of William Robert Oke (1833–1894), whose business was in operation for more than a century. W. R. Oke established a carriage factory on Victoria Street in Harbour Grace in 1856 and moved to Halifax, NS. He relocated to the corner of Cochrane and Duckworth Streets in St. John's by 1879, eventually employing four of his sons as W. R. Oke & Sons. Oke's grandfather moved the carriage factory to the corner of Prescott and Duckworth Streets in 1890. Oke was born the following year (1 September 1891), and then the premises and its contents were destroyed in the Great Fire of 1892. Although uninsured, the family managed to rebuild the business at the same location and rented a portion of the property on Prescott Street to other businesses in what became known as the \\"Oke Building\\". The company expanded to produce boxcars for Robert Gillespie Reid (Halls Bay Line, Newfoundland Railroad). By 1894, they provided undertaking and funeral services, similar to other carriage builders of the day, which continued until the business was dissolved in 1968. During Oke's life, the Oke's Carriage Factory was shepherded by his father, John Carnell Oke (1857–1931), and from 1926 by Oke's brother, Gordon Jeans Oke (1889–1977), when their father became incapacitated by chronic illness. The Okes were known for artistic carriage painting and for constructing the dog-cart presented by the children of Newfoundland, accompanied by the Newfoundland dog Bouncer, to the Duke & Duchess of Cornwall and York (later George V and Queen Mary), during their visit to the colony in 1901. An example of an Oke 19th century dog-cart (two-wheeled child’s carriage) is in the collection of The National Trust Carriage Museum (Devon). A Newfoundland dog, Sable Chief, in the same bloodline as Bouncer, was presented as mascot to the WW1 Newfoundland Regiment before leaving St. John's on the SS Florizel. Multi-generations of Oke families resided in St. John's connected to land on the south side of Quidi Vidi Lake where Oke grew up, at the juncture of Forest Road and Quidi Vidi Road, in the vicinity known as \\"Oke's Corner\\". Oke was named for his paternal grandmother, Mary Jane Harris Carnell (1832–1926), who was heir to a portion of the 20 acre New Forest estate owned by the Gill family from the 1700s. Oke is a descendant of Nicholas Gill, Sr. (d. 1787), a naval officer and judge of the vice admiralty court who became Chief Magistrate of St. John's, and who first occupied this land. His older brother, Michael Gill, Jr. (1699–1772), raised a militia to reinforce the British garrison and was the militia's first Lieutenant-Colonel, a Justice of the Peace from 1733, and held several other prominent positions in St. John's. Their father, Captain Michael Gill, Sr. (1673–1720), was an international trader in Massachusetts who is famous for defending Bonavista, NL from a brutal French and Indian attack in 1704 during Queen Anne's War. A plaque commemorating Captain Gill is mounted on the grounds of the Bonavista Court House. In 1960, a portion of the Oke family residence was converted to house the Oke funeral business. This and other homes once owned by the Oke family straddling both sides of the north end of Quidi Vidi Road are still standing in the historic \\"Oke's Corner\\" neighborhood. Oke was educated at Bishop Feild College and enjoyed fishing, shooting, motoring (driving an automobile), golf and tennis. He was the 4th generation of Oke family in Newfoundland to participate in Freemasonry, a tradition passed down from family in England. His maternal grandfather, John Jeans, was secretary of St. John's Lodge for 40 y. Oke's brother Gordon, was Master of Lodge Tasker No. 454 (St. John's, NL), Senior Grand Warden of the District Grand Lodge of Newfoundland (both Lodges of the Grand Lodge of Scotland), and was Director of the Masonic Mutual Life Insurance Association (St. John's, NL) for ten years. Oke's sister Lillabelle Victoria Oke (1897–1993) worked as secretary to Walter Stanley Monroe (1871–1952) and Richard Squires (1880–1940), Prime Ministers of Newfoundland. She pursued a nursing career, following in the footsteps of Oke's sister Maude Florence Oke (1902–1988), a nurse who married and migrated to Brooklyn, NY. Lillabelle attended the St. Johns Episcopal Hospital School of Nursing (Brooklyn, NY) from 1929 to 1932 , then worked at the Child's Hospital (Albany, NY), where she was Head Nurse during World War II, and the research nurse at the hospital cross-matching blood in drug experiments on adults conducted by the Bayer Aspirin Factory (Rensselaer, NY). During the summer months, she cared for children immobilised on a Bradford frame as treatment for polio or tuberculosis of the spine at Child's Hospital (Saratoga, NY). Later she worked as the school nurse for St. Agnes School (now Doane Stuart School), also in Albany. After the death of Oke's mother, Florence Jane Oke [nee Jeans] (1862–1948), Lillabelle returned to the family home to live with their sister Mary Dorothy Oke (1899–1961) and operate a small neighborhood soda fountain out of a former residence on Quidi Vidi Road (St. John's, NL). ==Military Career== Oke was a student-at-law and articled clerk with solicitor John Fenelon (1880-1934) in St. John's, NL from October 1909 until his final year in 1914 when he put his legal career on hold to respond to Governor Walter Edward Davidson's call to join the fight for Britain's war against Germany and Austria-Hungary. Oke, Regimental No. 565, enlisted 16 September 1914 with B Company of the 1st Battalion, Newfoundland Regiment and departed St. John's with several of his cousins aboard the SS Florizel on 4 October 1914. After training in Salisbury Plain, he served with the Quartermaster's personal staff for Captain Michael Francis Summers when the Newfoundland Regiment was at Fort George, Scotland. After the battalion provided guard duties at Edinburgh Castle and had arrived for further training at Stobs Camp near Hawick, Oke was promoted to Acting Corp. on 22 June 1915. On 11 November 1915, while in Ayr, Scotland, Oke transferred from the Newfoundland Regiment to a Commissioned Rank (2nd Lieutenant) in the 14th Battalion of the 1st Regiment of Foot Royal Scots (Lothian Regiment) of The New Army. Oke embarked for France on 12 June 1916 as part of the 11th Service Battalion, 27th Brigade, 9th (Scottish) Division under the command of Major- General William Furse, who geared up for a major offensive in the Battle of the Somme that July. The infantry participated in the Capture of Montauban and the liberation of Longueval. In March 1917, the 11th Battalion conducted a daylight reconnaissance along the Arras Cambrai Road followed in April by the Battle of Arras, during which Oke served as a Lieutenant (Temp.). Oke also served as Acting Captain (20 Jul 1917–10 Sep 1917). During the Third Battle of Ypres he was wounded, having been gassed on 17 August 1917 during the Battle of Langemarck and hit by shell fragments on 10 September 1917, which pierced his left shoulder and buttock. Oke was evacuated to the UK for surgery and recuperated at the W. London hospital for officers run by Lady Evelyn Mason, OBE LGStJ (1870–1944). According to his medical report, Oke was anxious to return to the fight in France and proceeded to the 3rd (Reserve) Battalion in Edinburgh. He embarked for France on 15 December 1917, rejoining the 11th (Service) Battalion. Oke was wounded on 26 March 1918 by a gunshot to the right shoulder. He was awarded a Military Cross on 26 July 1918 for leading a successful counter-attack in France, despite being wounded, that resulted in re-occupying a lost position and inflicting heavy casualties on the enemy. He was treated at the Leith War Hospital and recuperated at the Officers Command Depot, Ripon South. On 31 October 1918, he reported to the 3rd Reserve Battalion in Mullingar, Ireland. Oke was then ordered to serve in the North Russia Relief Force during the Archangel Campaign. He embarked on 28 April 1918, joining the 45th (Service) Battalion with the Royal Fusiliers, where he led a platoon in a counter-attack on river-craft that resulted in the surrender of two steamers and a gunboat, and saved the column a large number of casualties. For this service, he was awarded a Bar to the Military Cross. Oke relinquished his commission on completion of service with the Royal Scots Infantry on 11 December 1919, retaining the rank of lieutenant. Altogether, Oke was injured three times in combat (Aug 1917, Sep 1917, and Mar 1918). He was mentioned by Field Marshal Douglas Haig in his 9 April 1917 dispatch, one of only 25 Newfoundland soldiers in WW1 to be mentioned in despatches by official report from a Commander-in-Chief, for which he received a certificate and an emblem of a bronze oak leaf for his Victory Medal. He also received a British War Medal for his service in WW1. ==Colonial Service== While recuperating in Harrogate, Yorkshire at the Furness Auxiliary Hospital (also known as Furness Officers Hospital), Oke met Lady Furness, Ada \\"Daisy\\" Hogg, the first wife of Marmaduke Furness. The Furness' had converted the former Grand Hotel into a hospital to support the Red Cross. Lady Furness recommended Oke for Colonial Service and after a furlough in St. John's, Oke reported in London on 8 March 1920 for the British Foreign Office (Diplomatic Service). On 19 May 1920, he was appointed Administrative Officer of the Northern Province of the Colony and Protectorate of Nigeria. Due to ill health, he took an extended leave in England from September 1921 to February 1922. After returning to West Africa, he was based in Ilorin, Northern Nigeria, for at least two years, working as District Commissioner. Oke served in Nigeria for 12 y (1920–1932). Oke married Melinda Alice Duchaine (also referred to as DuChesne) on 27 February 1924, at Our Lady of Mercy Convent and Chapel (St. John's, NL). Melinda had worked in St. John's as a stenographer for John Fenelon, with whom Oke studied law before WW1. Their only child was stillborn. In the early 1930s, the Colonial government in The Gambia was engaged with Deutsche Luft Hansa (DLH), which sought to establish an airbase in Bathurst (now Banjul) to speed mail transit between Europe and South America. DLH undertook experimental air-sea routes using the catapult ship SS Westfalen (1905) and were quick to establish routine scheduled flights. In 1932 Oke was seconded to the Administrative Service of The Gambia and began serving as the Travelling Commissioner of the South Bank of the Gambia River. An epidemic of yellow fever broke out in Bathurst in the late fall of 1934, leading to numerous casualties including the death of the Colonial Secretary, Godfrey C. B. Parish, F.R.G.S. (1897–1934). On 20 December 1934, Oke advanced to the position of Acting Colonial Secretary, The Gambia. Oke held the British line in communication with DLH to protect military security as well as to protect opportunities for future commercial growth by Imperial Airways and other British business interests, which had not yet developed air routes in West Africa. The British enacted tight control by overseeing the landing authorities granted to DLH and insisting that each flight be scheduled and any change in equipment be approved in advance. Oke held the office of Acting Governor and Commander-in-Chief of The Gambia, British West Africa, six times, three times to fill-in for Governor Arthur Richards (Jan–Apr 1934, May–Oct 1935, Jun–Oct 1936) and three times to fill-in for Governor Thomas Southorn (Feb–Mar 1937, Apr–May 1939, and from Jun 1940). In May 1935, Oke attended the Silver Jubilee Service (London, England) by command of His Majesty to represent The Gambia on the 25th anniversary of King George V's Accession and received a King George V Silver Jubilee Medal. He also attended the King's funeral in 1936, and with his wife, Melinda, attended the Coronation of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth in 1937, and received a King George VI Coronation Medal. Oke was appointed a Companion to the Most Distinguished Order of St Michael and St George (CMG) by King George VI during the 1939 New Year Honours held in Dec 1938. From 1938 to 1940, as Germany advanced its agenda with little rein from international forces, West African nationals expressed mounting concern in the press over the possibility of annexation by Nazi Germany if the two major colonial powers, France and Britain, could not or would not help defend them. Germany suspended all civil flights to West Africa in August 1939 and initiated World War II, on 1 September 1939, at which time the DLH fleet came under command of the Luftwaffe. In West Africa, the reaction to war was immediate, particularly in the streets of Lagos, Nigeria where 10,000 people rallied for Britain and against Germany. Within two days, Britain and France declared war on Germany and on 6 September 1939, the Governor of The Gambia, Thomas Southorn, K.C.M.G., K.B.E.(1879–1957), instructed authorities to seize and dispose of DLH's local facilities to cut- off German access to Bathurst. As the war escalated, geopolitical boundaries and relationships in West Africa were shifting and uncertain. France surrendered to Germany, signing the Armistice of 22 June 1940, whereas Winston Churchill and Jean Monnet had contemplated the creation of a single Franco- British citizenship, uniting the two nations. Combat missions in Africa fired up, with Britain and its African colonies providing support to Charles de Gaulle's Free France movement in the form of finances, communications, supplies, aircraft, and other resources, with the immediate goal of protecting Nigerian borders. Although the pro-Nazi, Vichy-controlled territory of French West Africa was threatening Nigeria's northern border, de Gaulle gained control of Chad and the port of Libreville, Gabon by August and Cameroon by September. Oke underscored Britain's support for de Gaulle and the value of Bathurst (The Gambia) to Free France when he hosted a delegation of Free French Officers who were waylaid there in early August. Clyde, a Short Empire S.30 series flying boat on which the officers were travelling, had been damaged on take-off from Lisbon, Portugal and was undergoing repairs in Bathurst. The delegation went on to Leopoldville, Congo and negotiated with French officers from Brazzaville in an effort to convince them to join Free France. Regional morale was further stressed in September 1940 by de Gaulle's failure to secure a French West African strategic port during the Battle of Dakar, but rallied by October when he declared Brazzaville, Congo, as the capital of Free France. Allied aircraft could then use an east-west flight corridor across Chad, connecting Nigeria to Egypt. The British colonies, and Nigeria in particular, were well-positioned to gain economically from new trade with French Equatorial Africa, which had cut-off commerce with the Vichy-controlled West African territories. Despite feeling unwell, Oke participated in a strategic war conference at the Government House in Lagos, Nigeria on 19 November 1940. However, he failed to recover and died 18 December 1940. Oke was given a military funeral with full honors in Lagos, and is buried there. ==Legacy== In 2016, The Law Society of Newfoundland and Labrador acknowledged Oke's service during World War I and ceremonially called him to the Bar, conferring on him the Honorary Degree of Barrister of Law. This honor was recognised by the Newfoundland and Labrador House of Assembly. The Oke family gifted a stained glass window, \\"Baptism of Our Lord by John\\", from the studio of Robert McCausland Limited (Toronto, ON) to Oke's church, St. Thomas' (the oldest church in St. John’s, NL), in memory of Oke and his parents. == References == Category:Recipients of the Military Cross Category:Canadian military personnel from Newfoundland and Labrador Category:1891 births Category:1940 deaths Category:Governors of the Gambia Category:Royal Scots officers Category:Newfoundland Colony people ","title":"Harris R.

During Hall's lifetime, he helped mechanise the papermaking industry, co-founded the first UK canning firm, and developed steam engines for land and marine use. ==Early career== Born in Whitchurch, Hampshire, John was the second son of a millwright, William Hall (1710–1794), who had previously worked in Dartford, but was employed at the Portal family's paper mill in Laverstoke, Hampshire. John Hall moved to Dartford in April 1784, and was employed by a Mr T H Saunders to repair a mill on the River Darent in Hawley. Saunders urged Hall to set up his own business, repairing and maintaining machinery used in corn, paper, oil and powder mills in and around Dartford, and in 1785 Hall opened a workshop in Lowfield Street in Dartford. Bryan Donkin was an early apprentice, in 1792. ==Ventures with Donkin== Around 1800, the firm moved to larger premises in Waterside (now Hythe Street) on land which had once formed part of Dartford Priory. Through his association with Donkin, now involved in the area's papermaking industry, Hall helped a partnership with the Fourdrinier brothers (Henry and Sealy) and John Gamble, to make paper machines, installed in Frogmore Paper Mill in Apsley, Hertfordshire. Donkin, Hall and Gamble also collaborated on canning food in metal containers. Hall acquired Peter Durand's patent in 1812 and after various experiments, Donkin, Hall and Gamble set up a canning factory in Blue Anchor Lane in Bermondsey, the first cannery to use tinned iron containers. By late spring 1813 they were appointing agents on the south coast to sell the preserved food to outbound ships, and the British Admiralty placed large orders with the firm of Donkin, Hall and Gamble for tinned meat. Hall left the canning firm partnership in 1819, and the firm later merged into Crosse & Blackwell. ==Iron works== As an iron foundry business, Hall's company subsequently built steam engines and gun carriages. In the early days of marine engineering, Hall designed and made the engines for S.S. \\"Batavia\\" (for the Steam Navigation Company), and, in 1836, the S.S. \\"Wilberforce\\" (built by Curling & Young at Blackwall for the Humber Union S.S. Company of Hull). The company also designed and patented (1835), the first trunk engine, fitted on board the paddle steamer \\"Dartford,\\" built at Gravesend. Letterhead dating from the time of John Hall & Sons listed some of the company's products: :\\"'steam-engines on Woolff [sic] and Boulton & Watts principle; engines for steam vessels on improved principles; rolling mills for iron, copper, lead and zinc; patent steam presses for oil mills; roll bars and plates for paper engines; machinery for plate-glass works; oil, gunpowder, bark, corn, sugar and saw mills, hydraulic and screw presses, diving bells, pumps, cranes, etc.etc. 'fitted up in the best manner'.\\" Association with Richard Trevithick The plaque at St Edmund's Burial Ground, East Hill, Dartford. With the words \\"Richard Trevithick. Approximately 25ft from this wall lie the remains of Richard Trevithick. The great engineer and pioneer of high-pressure steam. He died at the Bull Inn, Dartford and was carried here by fellow workers of Halls Engineering Works. To a paupers grave. Born Illogan, Cornwall April 13th 1771. Died Dartford, Kent April 22nd 1833\\".J & E Hall is strongly associated with the late career (and death) of steam engine pioneer Richard Trevithick. In 1832, he was invited by John Hall to work on a steam engine at Dartford, and lodged at The Bull (today The Royal Victoria and Bull Hotel) in Dartford. In early 1833, Trevithick was taken ill with pneumonia and died at the Bull on the morning of 22 April 1833. Colleagues at Hall's works made a collection for his funeral expenses, acted as bearers, and paid a night watchman to guard his grave at night to deter grave robbers. ==Family life and church== On 17 December 1791, John Hall married Sarah Stainton, a daughter of local Dartford landowner Peter Brames. He had two sons John and Edward, the latter of which would head the business subsequently known as J & E Hall. John Hall (senior) was the principal founder of the first Wesleyan church in Dartford, converting two cottages at the corner of Priory Lane, Waterside, into a church, which opened on New Year's Day, 1794. This building soon became too small and a new building on the east side of Waterside was erected in 1798, at the cost of £700, and then further enlarged in 1819. Hall and his family also proved educational opportunities, with a Methodist Sunday School opened in a cottage which formed part of the ironworks. ==References== Category:1765 births Category:1836 deaths Category:English engineers Category:Millwrights Category:People from Whitchurch, Hampshire Category:People from Dartford Category:English mechanical engineers Category:People of the Industrial Revolution ","title":"John Hall (engineer)"},{"id":"54116246","text":"Local Libya is a media platform created in 2016 by Libyan journalists and civil society activists, co-founded by Libyan expert and journalist Mirco Keilberth.http://locallibya.com/ar/page/who-we-are It is hosted by Candid Foundation, a Berlin-based non-profit organisation.http://www.swr.de/swr2/kultur-info/echter-einblick-in- libyen/-/id=9597116/did=19053852/nid=9597116/1ym34zd/index.html The platform publishes articles, photography and videos from a mix of professional writers and citizen journalists covering ordinary life in Libya.

This added congestion resulted in the highest fatality total since 1996. 683 climbers from 34 countries attempted to climb the mountain, and 547 people summited. A record was set in May when 234 climbers summitted on a single day. There were 11 deaths, some of which were attributed to overcrowding near the peak. ==Mountaineering season== In addition to an increase in mountaineers compared to previous decades, the success rate for expeditions increased.

Amongst those who summited in 2012 was Vanessa O'Brien who completed the Explorers Grand Slam. The difficult decisions made during the climbing season were highlighted by the departure of guiding company Himex from the mountain after concerns about a hanging serac in the Khumbu icefall. Two years later, 16 Nepalese guides were killed when ice broke from the serac and created an avalanche. In 2012 Montana State University conducted a scientific expedition to Everest. The Everest Education Expedition studied the geology of the Everest massif which includes Everest-Nuptse-Lhotse-Khumbutse, and advanced the state of mineralogy, strain, and predicted rock ages. Of interest was the fossil-bearing limestone that crowns Mount Everest, the nature and impact of ice in the region (such as the icefall), and the overall stratigraphy (including limestone, metamorphic rocks, pelites, and quartzites). In May, Tamae Watanabe became the oldest woman to reach the summit, at the age of 73. She broke her own record, set in 2002 at the age of 63. The retired office worker lives at the base of Mount Fuji, and had climbed many other peaks including Denali, the Eiger, and Lhotse. She climbed with a group of four, and beat a competing 72-year-old woman who was trying for the same record. The Guinness Book of World Records states that 234 climbers summited on one day in 2012. However, it was one of the deadliest seasons since 1996, with 11 climbers dying on Everest in the spring. ==Fatalities== The death of Canadian climber Shriya Shah-Klorfine in May made headlines and fed a debate about whether inexperienced climbers should climb Mount Everest. Issues of overcrowding and unqualified guides were also raised. Although Shah-Klorfine did manage to summit, she did not survive the descent. Questions were raised about her lack of previous mountaineering experience, as Everest was reportedly her first mountain climb. The guiding company she employed had reportedly never guided a climber to the summit before. Other factors involved overcrowding on the mountain, a late summit bid, and insufficient bottled oxygen. The company alleges that she ignored instructions to turn around and earlier recommendations to not attempt the climb due to her lack of climbing skills. Four people, including Shah-Klorfine, died on Saturday May 19, 2012. Conditions on the mountain were described as overcrowded. { class=\\" collapsible sortable floatleft\\" style=\\"font-size: 90%; \\" - ! style=\\"text- align:center;\\" colspan=\\"2\\"2012 fatalities - !Deaths !Nation - Ralf Dieter Arnold  - Juan Jose Polo Carbayo  - Karsang Namgyal  - Ramesh Gulave  - Namgyal Tshering  - Dawa Tenzing  - Wen-Yi Ha  - Dr. Eberhard Schaaf  - Shriya Shah-Klorfine  - Won-Bin Song  - Milan Sedlacek*  - Temba Sherpa*  - colspan=\\"2\\"*Lhotse fatality } ==References== Category:Mount Everest Category:2012 in Nepal Category:2012 in Tibet Category:History of mountaineering ","title":"Mount Everest in 2012"},{"id":"54116365","text":"Breckland Farmland is a 13,392.4 hectare biological Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) in many separate areas between Swaffham in Norfolk and Bury St Edmunds in Suffolk.

He was one of the two sons of János (IV) Csányi (fl. 1444–75) and Katalin Hosszútóti (fl. 1467–68).Engel: Genealógia (Genus Hahót 2., Buzád branch) János was a prominent familiar to the Pető de Gerse family since 1453, but later joined the Kanizsais in the late 1460s. Balázs first appeared in a contemporary document in 1475, when Matthias Corvinus, King of Hungary confirmed the previously inherited and acquired villages and estates of the Csányi family in Zala (for instance, Csány, Tilaj and Bocfölde), Somogy (Vörs) and Vas Counties (Nagytilaj). Beside the young Balázs II, the royal charter mentioned his still living grandfather Balázs I, father János IV, brother Miklós I and cousin Márton I by name. The land donation was registered by the Fehérvár monastery. He was mentioned next time in the 1490s in estate affairs. In 1496, he filed a lawsuit against his relatives through his maternal grandmother Anna Egervári in connection with an inheritance dispute over lands in Zala, Vas and Križevci Counties. Balázs pledged the domain of Kisszőlős from Dénes Cseneházi, then vice-ispán of Zala County, on 13 October 1497. According to a royal charter of Vladislaus II of Hungary in 1498, his serfs and familiars plundered the estate of the Pauline Abbey of Örményes (today in Kehidakustány), when they were illegally hunting in the Paulines' forest. Balázs Csányi also had conflict with the Rajki family, who otherwise were relatives of his brother Miklós I (fl. 1464–1529), who married Veronika Rajki. According to a report published by the Zalavár Abbey on 24 July 1499, László Sárkány de Rajk complained that his relative Ferenc plundered his lands in Hahót and Buzádsziget (or Sárkánysziget), while Balázs Csányi did not return the occupied estate of Tormafölde and its related movable property. Finally, in 1500, Csányi entered into an arrangement with his relative, the famous lawyer Detre Rajki to mutually withdraw their legal actions. ==Career== Csányi started his political career as a member of the royal court of Vladislaus II, first mentioned in this capacity in 1500. He served as one of the concurrent vice-ispáns of Zala County from 1500 to 1501. In this regard, he first appeared in contemporary documents on 6 April 1500, alongside Illés Terjék de Szenterzsébet. In 1504 and 1506, he was mentioned as the appointed tax-collector (dicator) of the county, alongside Ferenc Sárkány de Ákosháza. Along with co-envoys György Kerecsenyi and András Kaczor de Lak, he represented Zala County in the Diet of Rákos (1505), where the delegates passed a bill which prohibited the election of a foreigner as king if Vladislaus's died without a male issue. According to a charter, Csányi and his companions requested a copy of the document from Judge royal Peter Szentgyörgyi de Bazin. By that time, he has gained considerable wealth, as the \\"nobles of Zala County\\" (i.e. generalis congregatio, the county assembly) borrowed him 1,100 florin to establish and equip militia portalis in 1506. According to historian Irén Bilkei, Csányi again served as vice-ispán of Zala County in 1511, but his name did not appear in archontological lists in that year. He was appointed juror during a trial by the general assembly which sentenced \\"proscribed\\" nobles in 1512. As a tax registration from 1513 preserved, Csányi had seven porta (or peasant household) and resided in Csány in a stone-built manor house, which later was enlarged to a fortress by his son Ákos in the middle of the 16th century. An Italian cartographer and military engineer Giulio Turco depicted the ground plan of the fort in a drawing in 1569, among other castles and strongholds. The maps are displayed in the Kriegsarchiv of Vienna. However, Balázs Csányi himself did not hold any castle. Alongside Detre Rajki, he was referred to as \\"the king's man\\" in 1516 during an investigation of a suspected violation of law by Tamás Pető de Gerse. In the same year, as one of the representatives of the lesser nobility (the so-called noble jurors), Csányi was elected to the royal council of the young Louis II of Hungary, who ascended the throne shortly before. Louis reaffirmed the land donations to the Csányi family upon Balázs' request. Csányi served as envoy of Zala County at the Diet of Bács in 1518 (today Bač, Serbia). He was again mentioned as a noble juror of the royal council in 1519. In 1520, Miklós Kapornay, Abbot of Zalavár wrote in his document that Csányi guaranteed the debt payment of the abbey to László and István Terjék, in exchange for the collateral of Zalavár domain. On 3 July 1520, King Louis II commissioned Csányi, among others, to investigate the report of the Buda Chapter, which complained that László Kanizsai's soldiers attacked its serfs in the chapel estates of Karos and Galambok. From 17 September 1520 to 1527, Csányi served as vice-ispán of Zala County for the second (or third) time. Meanwhile, he functioned as ispán (or head) of the chamber of salt in Transylvania in 1523, as his own charter claimed. He held that position, when his relative, the influential Zsigmond Pogány de Cséb held the dignity of ispán of chamber of salt in Máramaros (today Maramureș, Romania). Csányi did not participate in the Battle of Mohács, where his relatives, Ambrus Sárkány and Zsigmond Pogány were killed. He held the office of vice-ispán of Zala County until 1527. In that year, he represented his county alongside István Gyulafi and Dénes Háshágyi at the Diet of Buda which was convened by John Zápolya. Following that Csányi gradually retired from public life. On 1 January 1529, he bought lands in Alsókustán from local noble László Hollósi. A county dicalis of 1531 listed Csányi's property: 12 portas in Csány and 16 portas in Vindornyaszőlős. In his last years, he was familiar to the powerful Nádasdy family alongside his brother and sons. According to an undated letter of his son Ákos to his lord Tamás Nádasdy, his father Balázs Csányi and two of his brothers, István and Gergely died of a plague which had broken out following the Ottoman campaign and the Siege of Kőszeg in the summer of 1532. ==Family== Based on a document of fragmentary genealogical data from the early 16th century, Irén Bilkei claimed that Csányi married an unidentified lady from the Sárkány de Ákosháza family. A possession agreement in Somogy County from 1515 preserved his sons' names: Miklós, István, János, Gergely and Ákos. Two of them István and Gergely died of plague in 1532. János (V) was never mentioned again. Ákos, whose collection of 500 letters to Tamás Nádasdy is one of the most important primary sources of the 16th-century Hungarian history, married Anna Sitkey, they had a daughter Orsolya. Later members of the Csányi family descended from Miklós II (fl. 1500–41), who married Lúcia Maráczy. Balázs Csányi also had daughters: Margit married John Háshágyi, as a document of 1554 from a Place of authentication recorded. His other unidentified daughter was the mother of Jakab Zele de Szentbalázs, head of the court of Tamás Nádasdy in Kanizsa. At the county assembly of 9 December 1524, his niece Orsolya (daughter of Miklós I Csányi and Veronika Rajki) filed a lawsuit against him for her mother's dowry and morning-gift. During the trial, the property of Csány, Tilaj, Erdőhát e.g. were involved. There was a second trial in 1528 on the occasion of the last will and testament of Miklós I between Balázs and Orsolya Csányi (who, by then, married Gáspár Terjék). ==ReferencesSources== * * * Category:1532 deaths Category:15th-century Hungarian people Category:16th-century Hungarian people Category:16th-century deaths from plague (disease) Balazs ","title":"Balázs Csányi"},{"id":"54116410","text":"Sangu Chakkaram () is a 2017 Indian Tamil-language fantasy comedy film directed by Maarison, starring stunt master Dhilip Subbarayan, Punnagai Poo Gheetha, N.Raja, Pradeep, Jeremy Roske, Nishesh, Monicka, Swaksha,Abinethra, Krithik, Adarsh, Bala, Aditya,Tejo, and Ajeesh. == Cast == * Swaksha as Jennifer * Punnagai Poo Gheetha as Angayakanni * Baby Monika as Malar * Dhilip Subbarayan as Aagayam * N.

The explosion occurred due to negligence while transferring shells from the magazine, and it resulted in the detonation of of gunpowder. It killed approximately 200 people, including British and Maltese military personnel and Maltese civilians from Birgu. Parts of the city's fortifications, some naval stores, and many houses were destroyed, and the affected area became known as l-Imġarraf (Maltese for \\"the destroyed\\"). ==Background== In the 18th and early 19th centuries, the main gunpowder store in Birgu was located in a casemate within the city walls, close to the Porta Marina. This was an improvised measure; the casemate was not intended to be used as a gunpowder magazine, but such practice was common at the time. Gunpowder was also stored in casemates at other locations, such as Fort St. Angelo, Fort Ricasoli, and Mdina. The Birgu magazine was located close to civilian housing, and the residents had complained about the dangers before the explosion. Preparations had been made to find alternative sites but nothing had been done; the storerooms that were meant to store gunpowder were being used as barracks or military hospitals. The 1806 explosion was not the first time that a gunpowder disaster occurred in Malta. On 12 September 1634, a gunpowder factory in Valletta blew up, killing 22 people and causing severe damage to the Church of the Jesuits and the nearby college. In 1662, gunpowder that was stored in an echaugette on one of Valletta's counterguards exploded after being hit by lightning, but there were no casualties. ==Explosion== In July 1806, British forces in Malta were preparing artillery shells for shipment to Sicily, as ammunition stocks there were depleted due to the siege of Gaeta by the French. On 18 July, a working party of 13 men commanded by garrison gunner Bombardier Anderson were preparing a consignment of shells from the Birgu magazine, which was filled at full capacity with 370 barrels containing of gunpowder, as well as 1,600 shells and grenades. Anderson was using a metal chisel to remove the fuses from live shells, which was contrary to instructions, and this resulted in sparks which caused a massive explosion at 06:15. Anderson and the working party were killed instantly, as were three British soldiers of the 39th (Dorsetshire) Regiment of Foot and 23 Maltese soldiers of the 2nd Provincial Battalion. Between 150 and 200 civilians from Birgu were also killed, and approximately 100 others were injured by falling debris. The explosion frightened the inhabitants of Birgu, and it was also heard in the nearby cities of Senglea and Cospicua, as well as in the surrounding villages. The magazine was located within the city's fortifications, and a section of the walls \\"went up in the air\\" and left a large breach. The city gate at the Porta Marina, a small bastion, and part of a curtain wall were all destroyed and were never rebuilt. Parts of the Navy Store Houses were also damaged or destroyed during the explosion. Birgu's cityscape was also altered by the explosion, since a large number of houses were destroyed or damaged by the explosion itself and by the rocks which fell from the bastions. Four hundred ninety-three people reported property losses due to the explosion. ==Aftermath== Many Maltese people were angered at the loss of lives caused by negligence on behalf of the military. Civil Commissioner Alexander Ball reported that: Triq il-Vittmi tal-Porvlista, with similar magazines built in the same period still intact or partially intact Victims and their families were paid partial compensation, and Ball set up a committee overseeing aid distribution. He also urged the government to pay full compensation. This was initially denied, but eventually the poorer classes received a compensation equivalent to two thirds of their property which had been destroyed, while those of the upper classes received half of the value of their property. In 1811, £18,066.5s.10d was evenly distributed among those who had claimed damages. A wine merchant named Woodhouse lost a large amount of wine and the government provided him with extensive storehouses at the former Slaves' Prison in Valletta as a compensation. The initial total estimated damage for rebuilding was estimated at £35,000. A street close to where the explosion occurred is now known as Triq il-Vittmi tal-Porvlista (Maltese for \\"Polverista Victims Street\\"). The Vittoriosa Historical and Cultural Society installed a plaque at the St. Lawrence Cemetery on the 200th anniversary of the disaster in 2006, where most of the victims were buried. ==NotesReferences== Bibliography * ==Further reading== *Page 86 *Tragedja Kbira fil-Birgu (1806) Category:Birgu Category:Explosions in Malta Category:Non-combat military accidents Category:19th-century explosions Category:1806 disasters Category:1806 in Malta Category:July 1806 events ","title":"1806 Birgu polverista explosion"},{"id":"54116523","text":"Virandeep Singh (born 23 March 1999) is a Malaysian cricketer and the current captain of the Malaysia cricket team. ==Career== He played for Malaysia in the 2017 ICC World Cricket League Division Three tournament in May 2017.

McCray Thomas Hamilton McCray (1828 – Oct. 19, 1891) was an American inventor, a businessman and a Confederate States Army officer during the American Civil War. ==Biography== Thomas McCray was born in 1828 near Jonesborough, Tennessee, to Henry and Martha (Moore) McCray.Allardice, Bruce S., More Generals in Gray, Louisiana State Univ. Press, 1995, pgs. 137-138. He farmed in Tennessee and moved to Arkansas, where he operated a mill. Around 1856 he moved to Texas and operated a mill near Tellico. Just before the Civil War, he returned to Arkansas, settling in Wittsburg, Cross County. In June 1861 he joined the 5th Arkansas Infantry Regiment. He was commissioned a lieutenant and adjutant of that unit. In late 1861 he was detached from his regiment and returned to Arkansas to raise troops. He was elected major, then colonel, of the newly raised 31st Arkansas Infantry.Bass, Ronald R. \\"History of the Thirty-first Arkansas Confederate Infantry\\", Arkansas Research, Inc, Conway, He led a brigade of Texas and Arkansas infantry in the 1862 Kentucky Campaign. As part of Churchill's division, his brigade distinguishing itself at the August 30, 1862 Battle of Richmond, Kentucky. General Thomas J. Churchill singled out McCray for his \\"gallantry and coolness\\" in that action. Dissatisfied at not being promoted to Brigadier General, and realizing that his regiment had shrunk to less than 150 men and would soon be consolidated with another regiment, McCray requested transfer to the Trans-Mississippi Department. There he helped raising several regiments of Arkansas cavalry. During Price's 1864 Missouri Raid he led a cavalry brigade in Fagan's division. This brigade, consisting of the newly organized and ill-equipped 45th, 46th and 47th regiments of Arkansas cavalry/mounted infantry, performed poorly. Many of the men deserted, and the brigade dissolved after the raid. McCray retained a more or less nominal district command in northeast Arkansas, \\"powerless for good or for evil,\\"Edwards, John N., \\"Shelby and His Men\\" (Cincinnati, 1867), p. 313. till war's end.

He lists himself as \\"colonel\\" on his end-of-war paroleThomas H. McCray Compiled Service record, National Archives., but it is possible that in 1864 he received an unofficial promotion to brigadier. ==Post war== Like many other Confederates, he then left for Mexico. He then returned to Arkansas, and briefly lived in Wittsburg. After that he became a traveling salesman for the McCormick Reaper Company, based in Chicago, Illinois. Something of an inventor, McCray patented several improvements for cotton and hay presses.See U.S. Patent nos. 26,855 and 27,159.

He ended his debut season having amassed 13 appearances across all competitions with a return of four goals. In the following year's campaign, Córdova was marred by injury and had to undergo surgery after breaking the fifth metatarsal in his left foot. Despite the injury, he managed to make 20 appearances as Caracas ended fourth in the Venezuelan Primera División, thereby qualifying for the 2017 Copa Sudamericana. He made only four more appearances for the club, taking his overall tally to 38 with a return of five goals, before being signed by FC Augsburg following his impressive form with Venezuela at the FIFA U-20 World Cup.

He made his debut on 13 August, coming on as a second–half substitute for fellow debutante Marcel Heller in a 2–0 DFB Pokal loss to third division side Magdeburg. He scored his first goal for the club on 26 August, netting an 89th-minute equalizer from an assist by Heller in a 2–2 draw with Borussia Mönchengladbach. In October, whilst on international duty with Venezuela, Córdova suffered a fractured ankle and torn ligaments which him ruled out for part of the Hinrunde. He made his first Bundesliga start for the club the following year, starting in a 1–0 win over Hamburg on 13 January.

Three days later, he added two goals to his tally when he netted a brace in a 7–0 victory over Vanuatu which saw Venezuela become the first team to qualify for the knockout stages of the competition. Córdova scored again in a 1–0 win over Mexico on 26 May which helped Venezuela progress from their group without losing or conceding. His four goals saw him end as the tournament's joint-second top goal scorer alongside Fashion Sakala, Dominic Solanke, Jean-Kévin Augustin and Joshua Sargent, and one behind Golden Boot winner Riccardo Orsolini, as Venezuela were ultimately beaten by England in the final. Córdova's goal against Mexico in the group stages was also voted Goal of the Tournament.

It was originally on the estate of Eccleston and Scarisbrick. It was originally used as a place of worship by Catholics; records show that John Swinbourne received £36 from Thomas Eccleston in 1701. A silver chalice at the hall was kept there indefinitely until such time that Mass could be said in nearby Prescot Parish Church. In 1790, the hall was returned to the family owners. The current hall was built around 1830, by Samuel Taylor, a cotton manufacturer, who had been working in the previous building since 1827. It is constructed mainly of sandstone ashlar, with a hipped roof of Welsh slate. The building includes several Doric columns, and a southwards projection towards the garden. A church was also constructed by Taylor in 1838. In 1909, the estate around the hall was planned for suburban development. A scheme to build 4,000 homes on the grounds was unveiled in 1919. By this time, the hall was used as a Tuberculosis sanatorium. The building has been Grade II listed since 1989, by which time it was used for hospital administration.

His mother was probably either Meliboea, an Oceanid or Oread, one of the nymphs. Temenus established three sanctuaries for the goddess Hera. He gave her three surnames: (1) when she was still a maiden, Girl; (2) when married to Zeus he called her Grown-up; (3) when for some cause or other she quarreled with Zeus and came back to Stymphalus, he named her Widow.Pausanias, Graeciae Descriptio 8.22.2 * Temenus, son of Phegeus of Psophis in Arcadia and brother of Axion and Alphesiboea.Pausanias, Graeciae Descriptio 8.24.10 At the command of their father, Temenus together with his brother murdered by treachery their brother-in-law Alcmaeon and the two then dedicated the necklace of Harmonia to the god Apollo in Delphi. It is said that when the expedition of the Greeks to Troy took place, Temenus and Axion were the kings in the city that was still called Phegia (former name of Psophis). The people of Psophis assert that the reason why they took no part in the expedition was because their princes had incurred the enmity of the leaders of the Argives, who were in most cases related by blood to Alcmaeon, and had joined him in his campaign against Thebes. Later on, the widowed sister, Alphesiboea killed her own brothers in revenge of her husband's death.Propertius, Elegies 1.15.23 Otherwise, Apollodorus calls the two sons of Phegeus, Agenor and Pronous.Pseudo-Apollodorus, Bibliotheca 3.7.5 * Temenus, son of Aristomachus, and father of Archelaus.

The first filmed encounter between her and her ex- boyfriend, identified only as \\"Steve,\\" took place in April 2013. After the initial contact, several of the conversations were facilitated by Tod Augusta- Scott, a prominent counselor in the domestic violence field.'A Better Man' to be screened in Sudbury CBC, Oct.17, 2017Bridges InstituteTod Augusta-Scott (ed.). Innovations in Interventions to Address Intimate Partner Violence: Research and Practice. (Routledge Press, 2017) The film also follows them back to their old high school as well as an apartment in Ottawa, and shows how the violence still affects Khan. The film was financed through crowdfunding on Indiegogo; it raised over $110,000 CAD, making it one of the most successful crowdfunding campaigns in Canadian history. Upon release, it received mostly positive reviews from critics, and was chosen as one of the top 10 best films of 2017 by The Globe and Mail. == Background == After leaving Steve when she was 19, Khan would continue to encounter him in public. The first time she saw him, two years after she left him, Khan was weak and speechless. But as they continued to meet by chance over a six-year period, and her life continued to improve, they'd exchange a few minutes of small talk. It was during such chance encounter in 2011 that Steve asked if they could sit down. Once seated, Steve repeatedly apologized before bursting into tears. In the ensuing years, Khan wondered if talking to Steve more might help her deal with her trauma, and help Steve to better understand the roots and consequences of his violence and make him less likely to reoffend. She also decided to try to record such a dialogue as a resource for both domestic abuse survivors and offenders. She proposed such an idea to Steve in 2013. Six months later, he texted her that he was ready to meet. Two days later, they did so at a coffee shop for their first recorded exchange. Khan and her ex-abuser would go on film eight days together over the course of a year, sharing their memories and experiences and with Steve facing the consequences of what he did. == Production == A Better Man was co-produced by Intervention Productions (prod. Christine Kleckner) and the National Film Board of Canada (prod. Justine Pimlott), and executive produced by Sarah Polley, Anita Lee, Jane Jankovic, Janice Dawe, and Kathy Aurich-Johnson. The music was composed by Lesley Barber. Iris Ng was the film's cinematographer, having previously worked with Polley on Stories We Tell. A Better Man was co-written and co-directed by Attiya Khan. Attiya Khan is a Canadian filmmaker, anti-violence activist, and intimate partner violence survivor. She graduated with a degree in women's studies and psychology from the University of Toronto. Her interest in helping others who have experienced domestic violence led her to take the Assaulted Women's and Children's Counsellor/Advocate program at George Brown College. Her career highlights include overseeing the Children and Youth Services Program at Transition House in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and wide-ranging roles including frontline work, management and training with YWCA Toronto. She is based in Toronto.  Crowdfunding  The film was crowd-sourced through an Indiegogo campaign, with Feist among the donors, contributing $10,000. The campaign would go on to raise over $110,000—one of the most successful crowdfunding campaigns in Canadian history. == Release == The film screened at numerous film festivals and had its world premiere at the Hot Docs Canadian International Documentary Festival, where it was considered \\"one of Hot Docs most stirring films.\\"Digital Journal Today A Better Man continues to play at international film festivals and violence against women events. The film also plays on occasion at Hot Docs in Toronto, Ontario. == Distribution == A Better Man is distributed in the United States by Women Make Movies.  Reception  Since its release, the film has received mostly positive reviews from critics; Kate Taylor of The Globe and Mail listed the film in her top 10 list of films for 2017. The New Yorker film reviewer Doreen St. Félix commended the film's \\"cleverness\\" and wrote that \\"it resists the roundness of resolution or catharsis\\". Arwa Mahdawi of The Guardian described the film as \\"a call to action for abusive men to stand up and take responsibility for their anger and their actions.\\"The Guardian CBC host of The Current Anna Maria Tremonti stated that \\"there is a lot of raw emotion in this film and there is a lot hope.\\"The Current Maclean's reported that \\"the film manages to be simultaneously agonizing and hopeful… it is revelatory to know these kinds of [restorative] conversations are possible.\\"MacLean's Miriam Bale of Vulture.com called the film a \\"revolutionary documentary.\\" The Hollywood Reporter published a less enthusiastic review, concluding that \\"the vagueness and ambiguity of the situations eventually proves frustrating and detract from the film's power.\\" National Film Board of Canada made a review saying \\"A Better Man offers a fresh and nuanced look at the healing and revelation that can happen for everyone involved when men take responsibility for their abuse\\", commenting on the films use of healing process in domestic violence situations. == See also == *Restorative justice *Domestic violence *Domestic Violence Documentaries *Sexual Violence *Thordis Elva - book of rape and responsibility. ==ReferencesExternal links== * *http://www.wmm.com/filmcatalog/pages/c959.shtml * * *A Better Man at The Hollywood Reporter Category:Canadian independent films Category:Canadian documentary films Category:Canadian films Category:Films about domestic violence Category:2017 films Category:Documentary films about violence against women Category:Films shot in Ottawa Category:National Film Board of Canada documentaries Category:Films scored by Lesley Barber Category:Documentary films about reconciliation Category:Indiegogo projects Category:Crowdfunded films Category:2017 documentary films Category:Violence against women in Canada ","title":"A Better Man (film)"},{"id":"54116933","text":"Breckland Forest is an 18,126 hectare biological and geological Site of Special Scientific Interest in many separate areas between Swaffham in Norfolk and Bury St Edmunds in Suffolk.

The winter of 1904/1905 at the Académie Carrière he became friends with George Braque. The Bateau Lavoir was a lively place where his contact with other artists, painters, Picasso, Lhote, Gris, Van Dongen, as well as writers Max Jacob, Blaise Cendrars, Apollinaire deepened.Van Rees archives, RKD, The Hague, The Netherlands Paris would become their winter residence on and off for over 30 years, living at first in different places in Montmartre, later moving to Montparnasse. The summers were spent at Fleury-en-Bière, a little town next to Barbizon. Kees van Dongen spent the summer of 1905 there, together with Otto and Adya van Rees in the farmhouse Van Rees rented.

Some of his fellow artists became dear friends over many years: Severini, Segal, Freundlich, Mondriaan, Arp, Zadkine.archives Van Rees Foundation, the Netherlands First exhibitions After a stay in Italy his first grand exhibition of 48 paintings was held in 1908 in Rotterdam at the Oldenzeel gallery, gallery now famous for its exhibitions (1892-1904) of works by Vincent van Gogh. The Dutch public was not used to modernistic paintings and the critics were not positive. Van Rees focused on Paris. In Paris, during the early years, Otto van Rees exhibited his work at the gallery of Berthe Weil; and Léonce Rosenberg and at the yearly Salon des Artistes Indépendants. He also had part in the Sonderbund, Cöln, Germany in 1912 and the famous exhibition of Der Sturm in 1913. Cubism In 1912-1916 the art of Van Rees went through changes. His neo-impressionistic experiments to capture sunlight, depth and perspective in color were of the past. He was now concentrating on volume and form. His work evolved from physic cubism, as the art critic Guillaume Apollinaire described it, to analytic cubism. One of the first collectors of his art then was Arthur Jerome Eddy, an American art collector from Chicago. Dada Zürich During the first world war Van Rees changed his French summer residence for Ascona, the Swiss little town at the Lake Maggiore. The artistic and anarchistic colony, where artists, writers, anarchists and philosophers took refuge was inspiring.Harald Szeemann (ed.): Monte Verita, Berg der Wahrheit,1978 Zürich With Arp, who later spent Christmastime 1915 at the Van Rees, Otto and Adya held the famous exposition of November 1915 at the gallery Tanner in Zürich. This exposition is now seen as the beginning of Dada in Zürich.Tzara, Tristan Chronique Zurichoise, Dada Almanach, Berlin, 1920 p.10; Hans Richter: Dada Profile, Verlag Die Arche, Zürich,1961, p. 83 The art dealer Henri Kahnweiler named Van Rees as an artist that brought the collage technique from Paris to Zürich as the start of Dada Art. Ascona would keep Van Rees’ preference. In 1928 Otto van Rees constructed a house in Losone on the hills near Ascona. The house had a ground plan of a circle and a square, announcing the famous 1930 collective art show of Cercle et Carré.Ida Boelema and Irène Lesparre (ed.), Otto van Rees, Zwolle / De Bilt, 2005 Return to Holland After the tragic death of their oldest daughter, killed in a train accident in France, Otto van Rees spent more and more time in Holland. He moved there in 1934. In Holland the young painters called him their Nestor, who taught them the profound values on art. Many public buildings in Holland: churches, railway station, courthouse, ministry, theatres were embellished by his mural paintings. ==References== *Hans Richter: Dada Profile, Verlag Die Arche, Zürich,1961, p. 83 *Centraal Museum Utrecht: Otto en Adya van Rees, Leven en Werk tot 1934, Utrecht, 1975 *Kunsthaus Zürich: Dada in Zürich, 1985, ill. pp. 12. 13 etc. *John Richardson: A Life of Picasso, vol. 1, 1881-1906, New York, 1991, ill. pp. 376-377 *Joop M.

The idea of such an algorithm was put forward by C. W. Clenshaw and F. W. J. Olver in a paper published in 1980. In the problem of developing algorithms for computing, as regards the values of a real-valued function of a real variable (e.g., g[x] in \\"restricted\\" algorithms), the error that can be tolerated in the result is specified in advance. An interval on the real line would also be specified for values when the values of a function are to be evaluated. Different algorithms may have to be applied for evaluating functions outside the interval. An unrestricted algorithm envisages a situation in which a user may stipulate the value of x and also the precision required in g(x) quite arbitrarily. The algorithm should then produce an acceptable result without failure. ==References== Category:Numerical analysis * Category:Theoretical computer science ","title":"Unrestricted algorithm"},{"id":"54117028","text":"Eucithara souverbiei is a small sea snail, a marine gastropod mollusk in the family Mangeliidae.WoRMS (2009).

Bugge is notable because she was a woman brewer in the 15th/16th century. Usually wives assisted their husbands and their contribution is never identified in the records. In Agnes' case her husband was a draper and therefore it becomes clear that it was Agnes who brewed. This is noted in 1419/20 when the brewers were in dispute with the City of London. The brewers agreed to create a fighting fund and Stephen paid the largest contribution for his wife's brewery.Caroline M. Barron, ‘Women traders and artisans in London (act. c.1200–c.1500)’, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, Jan 2008 accessed 23 May 2017 Idonea Hatton's husband also made a contribution but in her case they had the brewery jointly. 19 of the 24 breweries involved included women but the Bugge's brewery appeared to the only one operated by a woman, although it was noted that 80% of the breweries were run in part by a married woman. When Stephen died it becomes clear how the law saw the situation, as Stephen had to leave Agnes' brewery to her. The funds raised won the case against the city of London. At that time the Lord Mayor of London was Dick Whittington. ==References== Category:Breweries in London Category:14th- century births Category:15th-century deaths Category:People from London Category:15th-century English businesspeople Category:Medieval English merchants ","title":"Agnes Bugge"},{"id":"54117330","text":"Fedlim Geancach Ó Conchobair (Feidhlimidh Gheangcaigh mac Toirdhealbhaigh Óig Ó Conchobhair Donn) (died 1475) was an Irish monarch of the fifteenth century.

They must carefully select the farmers who will work the land and ensure that the number of family members is not too high or too low and can provide the right amount of work. Landowners must pay their farmers' expenses in the periods of the year when the weather does not permit farming, to maintain motivation and health. Employers must invest in tools to help the farmers.  Advice for farmers  Lastri underlines the importance of a house's cleanliness. He discusses handling of waste and clean water reservoirs. Farmers must not work when ill and must drink water during the working day. After some tips about diet, the author explains the importance of moderation and self-control to maintain health and serenity.  Mountains  Mountains are much more suitable for pasture than cultivation. However, landowners have often exploited this type of land, depleting them even of their poor fertility. Lastri thinks woods and mountain lands should be preserved for environmental, practical and economic reasons.  Potatoes  This part is an interview of a landowner of Pistoia (a little city near Florence). The landowner explains his secrets to cultivate and cook potatoes.  Cane thickets  Lastri explains why cane thickets are a useful type of cultivation. Cane thickets are cheap to cultivate and useful to sustain other plants. The work concludes after describing how to practically cultivate cane thickets. ==Editions== First edition: Lastri, Marco, 1793, Regole per i padroni dei poderi verso i contadini per proprio vantaggio e di loro, con dei Avvisi ai medesimi sulla loro salute.

He was the son of Nicolas Mignard and Marguerite d'Avril. His family included a number of artists. His father and uncle Pierre Mignard were prominent history and portrait painters. His younger brother Pierre became an architect and painter. Portrait of Nicolas Mignard, painting an Annunciation Paul Mignard was a pupil of his uncle Pierre Mignard. He was received into the Académie royale de peinture et de sculpture on 11 June 1672. The work that earned him admission to the Académie was a large Portrait of Nicolas Mignard, painting an Annunciation (Museum of Fine Arts of Lyon).Hannah Williams, 'Académie Royale: A History in Portraits', Ashgate Publishing Ltd., 2015, p. 27 It shows his father sitting in his studio in front of a painting he is working on and holding his palette and brushes. On a table placed next to his father is a copy of the Architettura di Palladio, together with a ruler and compasses.Guido Beltramini, 'Palladio and Northern Europe: Books, Travellers, Architects', 1999, p. 43 It is known that Mignard spent time in Italy in the 1670s but little is known about his stay.J. Claye, Gazette des beaux-arts, 1966, p. 22-24 He also was in England painting portraits. He was active in Bavaria as court painter to the family of the Elector. He painted several portraits of the Elector and his wife Henriette Adelaide of Savoy, who held him in high esteem. He dedicated his self-portrait (Alte Pinakothek, Munchen) to Henriette Adelaide of Savoy.Pierre Rosenberg, 'Poussin, Lorrain, Watteau, Fragonard ...: französische Meisterwerke des 17. und 18.

On 7 September 1690, Mignard was appointed ordinary painter of the city of Lyons. This appointment required him to paint portraits of city officials. Paul Mignard died on 15 October 1691 in Lyon. ==Work== Portrait of Mrs Peter Beesley Paul Mignard painted mainly portraits. He had learned from his uncle Pierre the art of court portrait painting, characterised by its emphasis on elegant poses and elaborately worked out details of lavish costumes. The works stressed the high status of the sitters and the affluence of their entourage.Lada Nikolenko, 'Pierre Mignard', Nitz Verlag, 1983, p. 27-34 As father and son Mignard painted in a style, which was not very different, the portrait of Jean-Baptiste Lully has often been attributed to the father. However, the inscription on the print that was engraved after this portrait by Jean-Louis Roullet in 1687 clearly states that it was Paul Mignard, the son of Nicolas Mignard, who painted it.Stewart Buettner , 'Great composers, great artists: portraits', Reinhard G. Pauly Amadeus Press, 1992, p. 26 Paul Mignard was also connected to a series of portraits of beauties executed for the Duke of Savoy in the mid 1670s. On 2 January 1683 Paul Mignard presented the Académie with his 'Ode à Mr Le Brun pemier peintre du Roy' (Paris, published at Pierre Le Petit, 1683). In this publication Mignard sang the praises of the art of the leading French painter of the 17th century, Charles Le Brun, who was a friend of his father but a rival of his uncle.Charles Perrault, 'La peinture', Librairie Droz, 1992, p. 172 Not long before the Ode was published, Paul’s uncle Pierre and Le Brun had engaged in a bitter exchange of accusations. Paul Mignard took the side of Le Brun against his uncle and the Ode was his manner of expressing his support for Le Brun. The Ode is considered to be an awful example of sycophancy.André Fontaine, 'Documents sur Pierre Mignard, Paul Mignard et Charles Le Brun', in: Archives de l'art français: recueil de documents inédits publiés par la Sociéte de l'histoire de l'art français, J.

Accessed through: World Register of Marine Species at http://www.marinespecies.org/aphia.php?p=taxdetails&id;=433769 on 2017-05-23 ==Description== The length of the shell attains 16 mm, its diameter 6 mm. The shell is longitudinally ribbed and transversely striate. Both lips are denticulate. Its color is yellowish white or light brown, with an interrupted white median band margined below with chestnut.G.W. Tryon (1884) Manual of Conchology, structural and systematic, with illustrations of the species, vol. VI; Philadelphia, Academy of Natural Sciences The fusiform shell, has an elongated oblong shape. It appears to be one of the largest species of its kind. Its coloring is yellowish-white in the upper part of the whorls, and is of a light fawn tone in the lower part. These two colors are separated by a small brown zone that circulates between the ribs. On the body whorl the tawny yellow hue appears at the suture and disappears at the siphonal canal, leaving only two white bands, one on the upper part of the whorl, the other at the end. The spire is decorated with longitudinal ribs and decurrent striae; The ribs (numbering 10 on the penultimate whorl and 11 on the body whorl), are fairly prominent, not very thick, leaving between them an interstice equal to twice their breadth. Originating at the suture, they descend flexuously towards the siphonal canal where their concentric arcs come together. The spiral striae are weak, not prominent, and sufficiently impressed. They traverse the ribs and their interstices; They decrease in number towards the siphonal canal as they become more stronger and higher. The only copy of this species has the apex fractured. There are only 5 whorls left. These whorls are convex, separated by an undulating linear suture. The body whorl, which exceeds half the total height, presents, on the side opposite to the outer lip, a convex profile, more rapidly acuminated below the middle. The aperture is obliquely elongated, narrowly semi-oval. The peristome is continuous, white in the interior. The columella, weakly concave in its upper part, is furrowed in its entire length by numerous folds, very distinct but rather thin, which run along the edge in its width and In the interior. The outer lip, seen from the front, offers a fairly regular semi-oval profile. Seen in the plane of the aperture, it is flexibly arched. Thickened on the last rib, it presents a sharp lip below which comes a large number of small well-marked folds, which appear as denticles. The sinus, located below the suture, is small, obliquely and deeply lodged back in the callus which is prominent on the outer lip.Hervier, J. 1898.

This agnostic API would perform basic cryptographic operations, such as hashing, signature generation and verification and encryption as well as decryption from within a web application. ==Description== The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) was founded in 1994 by Tim Berners-Lee who is the original architect of the World Wide Web. This consortium consists of international companies that are involved with the Internet and the World Wide Web. Its purpose is to develop open standards and provide recommendations that will allow the Web to continue to evolve in a single direction versus splintering into different factions that could potentially compete against one another. On 26 January 2017, the W3C released its recommendation for a Web Cryptography API that could perform basic cryptographic operations in web applications. This agnostic API would utilize JavaScript to perform operations that would increase the security of data exchange within web applications. The API would provide a low-level interface to create and/or manage public keys and private keys for hashing, digital signature generation and verification and encryption and decryption for use with web applications. The Web Cryptography API could be used for a wide range of uses, including: * Providing authentication for users and services * Electronic signing of documents or code * Protecting the integrity and confidentiality of communication and digital data exchange Because the Web Cryptography API is agnostic in nature, it can be used on any platform. It would provide a common set of interfaces that would permit rich Internet applications to conduct cryptographic functions without the need to access raw keying material. This would be done with the assistance of the SubtleCrypto interface, which defines a group of methods to perform the above cryptographic operations. Additional interfaces within the Web Cryptography API would allow for key generation, key derivation and key import and export. ==Vision for using the Web Cryptography API== The W3C’s specification for the Web Cryptography API places focus on the common functionality and features that currently exist between platform-specific and standardized cryptographic APIs versus those that are known to just a few implementations. The group’s recommendation for the use of the Web Cryptography API does not dictate that a mandatory set of algorithms must be implemented. This is because of the awareness that cryptographic implementations will vary amongst conforming user agents because of government regulations, local policies, security practices and intellectual property concerns. There are many types of existing web applications that the Web Cryptography API would be well suited for use with. Multi-factor authentication Today multi-factor authentication is considered one of the most reliable methods for verifying the identity of a user of a web application, such as online banking. Many web applications currently depend on this authentication method to protect both the user and the user agent. With the Web Cryptography API, a web application would have the ability to provide authentication from within itself instead of having to rely on transport-layer authentication to secret keying material to authenticate user access. This process would provide a richer experience for the user. The Web Cryptography API would allow the application to locate suitable client keys that were previously created by the user agent or had been pre-provisioned by the web application. The application would be able to give the user agent the ability to either generate a new key or re-use an existing key in the event the user does not have a key already associated with their account. By binding this process to the Transport Layer Security that the user is authenticating through, the multi-factor authentication process can be additionally strengthened by the derivation of a key that is based on the underlying transport. Protected document exchange The API can be used to protect sensitive or confidential documents from unauthorized viewing from within a web application, even if they have been previously securely received. The web application would use the Web Cryptography API to encrypt the document with a secret key and then wrap it with public keys that have been associated with users who are authorized to view the document. Upon navigating to the web application, the authorized user would receive the document that had been encrypted and would be instructed to use their private key to begin the unwrapping process that would allow them to decrypt and view the document. Cloud storage Many businesses and individuals rely on cloud storage. For protection, remote service provide might want their web application to give users the ability to protect their confidential documents before uploading their documents or other data. The Web Cryptography API would allow users to: * Choose to select a private or secret key * Derive an encryption key from their key if they wish * Encrypt their document/data * Upload their encrypted document/data using the service provider’s existing APIs Electronic document signing The ability to electronically sign documents saves time, enhances the security of important documents and can serve as legal proof of a user’s acceptance of a document. Many web applications choose to accept electronic signatures instead of requiring written signatures. With the Web Cryptography API, a user would be prompted to choose a key that could be generated or pre-provisioned specifically for the web application. The key could then be used during the signing operation. Protecting data integrity Web applications often cache data locally, which puts the data at risk for compromise if an offline attack were to occur. The Web Cryptography API permits the web application to use a public key deployed from within itself to verify the integrity of the data cache. Secure messaging The Web Cryptography API can enhance the security of messaging for use in off-the-record (OTR) and other types of message-signing schemes through the use of key agreement. The message sender and intended recipient would negotiate shared encryption and message authentication code (MAC) keys to encrypt and decrypt messages to prevent unauthorized access. JavaScript Object Signing and Encryption (JOSE) The Web Cryptography API can be used by web applications to interact with message formats and structures that are defined under JOSE Working Group. The application can read and import JSON Web Signature (JWK) keys, validate messages that have been protected through electronic signing or MAC keys and decrypt JWE messages. ==Conformance to the Web Cryptography API== The W3C recommends that vendors avoid using vendor-specific proprietary extensions with specifications for the Web Cryptography API. This is because it could reduce the interoperability of the API and break up the user base since not all users would be able to access the particular content. It is recommended that when a vendor-specific extension cannot be avoided, the vendor should prefix it with vendor-specific strings to prevent clashes with future generations of the API’s specifications. == References  External links == * * Web Crypto API on MDN Web Docs Category:Cryptography standards Category:XML-based standards Category:World Wide Web Consortium standards ","title":"Web Cryptography API"},{"id":"54117447","text":"Michele Graglia is a model, author, fitness coach, and ultra marathon runner.

Before beginning a prestigious solo career in 1994 he was already known for being a founding member of bands TNT and Os Cascavelletes, both pioneers of the Rio Grande do Sul rock scene in the mid- to late 1980s/early 1990s. ==Biography== Early years, TNT and Os Cascavelletes Flávio Basso was born in Porto Alegre, Rio Grande do Sul, on January 26, 1968; his father was a physicist and his mother a teacher of German descent. He learned by himself to play the classical guitar when he was 13 years old,Entrevista de Júpiter Maçã para a TV Limão and cites Paul McCartney, Syd Barrett, John Lennon, Bob Dylan, Mick Jagger and Brian Jones as some of his influences. In 1984 he formed the rockabilly band TNT alongside his childhood friends Márcio Petracco, Felipe Jotz and Charles Master, being later joined by Nei Van Soria. TNT reached nationwide notoriety after their songs \\"Entra Nessa\\" and \\"Estou na Mão\\" were included in the 1985 compilation Rock Grande do Sul, made to promote rock bands from Rio Grande do Sul (such as Engenheiros do Hawaii, Os Replicantes, DeFalla and Garotos da Rua) and released by RCA Records.NewYeah.com ~ Rock Grande do Sul – 30 Anos In 1986, one year before TNT released their first studio album, Van Soria and Basso left the band due to creative divergences with RCA to form their own project, Os Cascavelletes, which, despite its relatively short lifespan, managed to release one EP, one studio album and a demo. They self-described their irreverent style, characterized by comical and heavily sexually explicit lyrics, as \\"porno rock\\". The band's most famous composition was the 1989 hit \\"Nêga Bombom\\", featured in the soundtrack of the telenovela Top Model. Os Cascavelletes broke up in 1992. In 1993 Basso re-joined TNT to record the single \\"Você Me Deixa Insano/Tá na Lona\\", but definitely left them again the following year after a falling-out with Charles Master. Solo career After his second departure from TNT, Basso began to perform solo, under the moniker \\"Woody Apple\\" (as an homage to musician Woody Guthrie and record label Apple Records, founded by The Beatles). It wasn't until 1995 when he adopted the stage name he became famous for, Júpiter Maçã (with \\"Júpiter\\" being an allusion to the fictional spaceship Jupiter 2, from one of his favorite TV series growing up, Lost in Space), and formed the very short-lived project Os Pereiras Azuiz alongside Ubirajara Guimarães, Rogério Campos and Luiz Wilfrido; they only released a demo tape, Orgasmo Legal, before disbanding.Demo-tapes Brasil: Júpiter Maçã & Os Pereiras Azuiz (1995) In 1997 he signed with independent label Antídoto to release his first solo full- length album, A Sétima Efervescência, which counted with guest appearances by his former Os Cascavelletes bandmates Frank Jorge and Alexandre Barea, and by Graforreia Xilarmônica guitarist Marcelo Birck; with a heavily psychedelic and experimental sonority comparable to Pink Floyd's 1967 debut The Piper at the Gates of Dawn, the album was critically acclaimed at the time of its releaseDisco Furado: Júpiter Maçã \\"A sétima efervescência\\" (Antídoto, 1997) and in 2007 was ranked 96th at Rolling Stone Brasils list of 100 Greatest Brazilian Music Records. Its follow-up from 1999, Plastic Soda, came out through Trama, and unlike its predecessor, it was fully sung in English; to reflect this, Basso signed the album as Jupiter Apple. It was characterized by an increase in the experimental elements already present in A Sétima Efervescência, mixing psychedelic rock with bossa nova and jazz. Even though it also had a good reception, critics considered it a very hard album to listen to.Disco Furado: Jupiter Apple \\"Plastic Soda\\" (Trama, 1999) After the album's release Basso temporarily moved to England, returning to Brazil in 2002. Hisscivilization, his third album, was released soon afterwards by Voiceprint Records, and was his most ambitious and elaborate work; it is composed of 13 mostly instrumental tracks, the longest of which opens the album and is over 11 minutes long.Mofo – Jupiter Apple – Hisscivilization Basso experimented more with electronic music elements in this album, what polarized critics and fans alike. In 2003 he moved to Europe once again – this time to Spain – alongside his then-domestic partner Bibiana \\"Bibmo\\" Morena to work on further material; after a 4-year hiatus, both returned to Brazil and he released alongside her the collaborative album Bitter through Monstro Discos.Gypsy Rose Produções: Bibiana Morena & Os Multicromáticos Through Elefant Records and in the same year he released his fourth (and ultimately last) album, Uma Tarde na Fruteira. It was re-issued in Brazil by Monstro Discos in 2008. In 2009 he released the non-album single \\"Modern Kid\\". In 2006, six of Basso's songs – \\"Um Lugar do Caralho\\", \\"Querida Superhist x Mr. Frog\\", \\"Canção para Dormir\\", \\"The Freaking Alice (Hippie Under Groove)\\", \\"As Mesmas Coisas\\" and \\"A Marchinha Psicótica de Dr. Soup\\" – were included in the soundtrack of the animated film Wood & Stock: Sexo, Orégano e Rock'n'Roll, directed by Otto Guerra. On November 23, 2011, Basso performed live at the Bar Opinião in Porto Alegre, accompanied by his newly founded supporting band, J.A.C.K. (an acronym for \\"Jupiter Apple Corporation and Kingdom\\"), at the time composed of Julio Sasquatt (drums), Julio Cascaes (electric guitar), Felipe Faraco (bass guitar) and Astronauta Pinguim (keyboards). A DVD of the performance, entitled Six Colours Frenesi, was released in 2014. On July 20, 2012, he accidentally fell off the second floor of the building where he lived, and fractured one of his wrists and a vertebra. He was then admitted at the Hospital de Pronto Socorro de Porto Alegre, and eventually recovered after a successful surgery. His final releases were the digital singles \\"Constantine's Empires\\" and \\"They're All Beatniks\\", which came out through Marquise 51 Records in 2015. The first one is available for listening at the record label's official SoundCloud page.Jupiter Apple – CONSTANTINE'S EMPIRES Alongside Tatá Aeroplano he wrote and directed the short film Apartment Jazz, which was broadcast for the first time by MTV in 2010.Jupiter Apple – Apartment Jazz In 2011 he appeared in \\"Kreuko\\", a segment of the anthology film Mundo Invisível, alongside José Wilker and Sônia Braga. In 2015 he began work on a second short, Jane's Nightmare; a trailer was uploaded to YouTube on July 15,Trailer of Jane's Nightmare  A movie by Jupiter Apple but the film was left unfinished following Basso's death. He also hosted the short-lived talk show Júpiter Maçã Show on MTV. Basso played his final show on December 5, 2015 at the Panamá Studio Pub, in Porto Alegre. Death and legacy Known for his extravagant lifestyle, Basso struggled with alcoholism and drug abuse (he claimed he took Diazepam and used LSD and cocaine on a regular basis) throughout most of his life, and was undergoing a treatment for cirrhosis on his later years. On December 21, 2015, he was found dead on the bathroom floor in his apartment; his cause of death was later revealed as being multiple organ failure. His wake was held at the Teatro Renascença in Porto Alegre, and he was buried the following day at the Cemitério Ecumênico João XXIII. Commenting on his death, Basso's former Os Cascavelletes bandmate Frank Jorge said that he was a \\"tireless creator, a guy who broke away from all commonplaces and predictability\\". Musician and poet Rogério Skylab has once stated that Basso was one of his major influences,Bate-papo com Rogério Skylab  Bate-papo UOL and besides interviewing him for his talk show Matador de Passarinho he has also covered his songs \\"Na Casa de Mamãe\\" (for Skygirls), \\"Eu e Minha Ex\\" (for Trilogia dos Carnavais: 25 Anos de Carreira ou de Lápide) and \\"A Marchinha Psicótica de Dr. Soup\\" (for Crítica da Faculdade do Cu). Former Os Replicantes vocalist Wander Wildner covered \\"Um Lugar do Caralho\\" for his 1996 solo debut Baladas Sangrentas. Rock band Ira! covered \\"Miss Lexotan 6mg Garota\\" for their 1998 album Você Não Sabe Quem Eu Sou. Basso's semi-fictional autobiography, A Odisseia: Memórias e Devaneios de Jupiter Apple, co-written by Juli Manzi, was published posthumously by Azougue Editorial in 2016. Work on the book began in 2014. Another biography of the musician, Júpiter Maçã: A Efervescente Vida e Obra, written by journalists Cristiano Bastos and Pedro Brandt, was published on September 5, 2018 by Plus Editora. On July 4, 2016, Nei Van Soria released a song in tribute to Basso, entitled \\"Balada para Flávio\\". He originally wrote the song in November 2015, one month before Basso's death. As of September 2017, a documentary about Basso, entitled O Garoto de Júpiter, is being made. Directed by Biah Werther and produced by Gabriel Flag, its production is being crowdfunded through website Catarse. On January 29, 2018, friends of the musician performed a special show in his honor at the Bar Ocidente in Porto Alegre, to celebrate what would have been his 50th birthday on January 26. In April 2018 a vinyl deluxe edition of Basso's debut album A Sétima Efervescência came out through Monstro Discos. Monstro Discos announced in November 2018 that a double-vinyl reissue of Uma Tarde na Fruteira was underway; it was released in January 2019. ==Discography== With TNT {  - ! Year !

Frohring, Chemist, Dies at 66, Plain Dealer, September 14, 1959 He was a co-developer of \\"simulated milk adapted\\" (SMA), the first infant formula to be distributed in the United States and one of the most widely consumed infant formulas in the world.\\"History of SMA and S-26\\", Rudolph M. Tomarelli, Wyeth-Ayerst (1992) Frohring held 15 patents, and led research in dairy products, and the refinement, synthesis and manufacture of vitamin products. ==Early life== William Frohring was born in Cleveland, Ohio, the son of William Erhardt Frohring, a railroad engineer, and Martha Louise Bliss. He graduated from East Technical High School in Cleveland. After graduation, he worked as a motorcycle mechanic at the Luna Park, Cleveland Motordrome. In 1911, he received a two-year scholarship to Ohio State Agricultural College, where he majored in bacteriology and dairy technology. He graduated in 1915. ==Work with Gerstenberger== Frohring took a job on the loading dock at Telling-Belle Vernon Dairy, the largest dairy in Ohio. Eight months later, he was offered an opportunity to run fat tests in the Telling-Belle Vernon labs for Henry J. Gerstenberger, MD, the medical director of Babies Dispensary and Children's Hospital (later, Rainbow Babies & Children's Hospital), a pediatric hospital in Cleveland.Dr. Henry J. Gerstenberger, Notable Pediatrician, is Dead, Plain Dealer, June 25, 1954 Dr. Gerstenberger, with the assistance of Harold O. Ruh, MD, was investigating the possibility of developing a dairy formula to supplement or replace maternal milk for infants. ==Development of SMA== William Frohring was brought on as part of the team with Gerstenberger and Ruh, and eventually became chief chemist on the project. The group's formula was based on diluted skimmed milk, with lactose and potassium chloride added to reach the human milk level. Among their novel contributions was to use mixtures of fats and oils rather than cream to duplicate human milk fat.Mothers and Medicine: A Social History of Infant Feeding, 1890–1950, Rima D. Apple, University of Wisconsin Press, 1987, pp. 38-41 Experimental batches of SMA distributed to local pediatricians were well received. The group began getting orders for more. Frohring stepped forward as the business leader of the group. His idea was to give the patent of the formula to Babies Dispensary and Children's Hospital, and license the manufacture to Telling-Belle Vernon Dairy. By 1919, Frohring was director of the laboratory at Telling-Belle Vernon Dairy, and had invented several pieces of laboratory and dairy processing equipment. In 1921, he was made a director and placed in charge of Laboratory Products Company, the company's new subsidiary to manufacture SMA, located in Mason, Michigan. Laboratory Products Company diversified into the development of research into other newly identified biochemicals. Frohring recruited Albert Fredrick Ottomar Germann to study carotene. The company went on to become the world's major supplier of carotene. As an employee of the dairy, Frohring accumulated patents on a process for the production of soluble casein, an improved process for lactose production, a vitamin C concentrate from orange and tomato juice for addition to SMA, and a formulation called \\"Frohs Malted Chocolate Milk\\". The company was renamed the SMA Corporation, and added carotene concentrate, refined from palm oil, to its product line. Frohring set up a company to process the palm oil. He made his younger brother Paul (formerly sales manager for SMA Corporation), president and general manager. In 1939, SMA, its subsidiary, and all rights to the infant formula were purchased by American Home Products Corporation (AHPC). Frohring stayed on as president of the SMA Corporation, now owned by AHPC. He later became a director of AHPC. ==Other inventions== In the early 1950s, Frohring received patents for Frohring Cement Mixers, a line of compact, portable mixers than can be moved out to a field and operated by hand, electric motor, gasoline motor or tractor motor. In 1953, Frohring patented a neurological research device known as a biothesiometer, used to determine a patient's sensitivity to vibration. Other patents include a formula for hypo-alergic milk, a process of making liquid malted milk, and a method for determining vitamin A deficiency, and a method for extracting carotene. He was made an honorary doctor of science by McKinley-Roosevelt College in Chicago, Illinois. ==Personal== Frohring's father, William, a railroad engineer, was born in Bavaria and immigrated to the United States at 1 years old, while his mother, Martha, was born in Ohio to German emigrants.1880 United States Census, 1910 United States Census He was married to the former Gertrude Lewis, and had four children.

A patent was applied for in Victoria in late 1865. He may have been living in South Yarra when his company was awarded £25 premium for initiating a new industry to the colony. No more was heard of his company or the product.

By 1793 he was living in the Ffynnonhenry area, and was ordained minister there in 1794, and also at Horeb church, Rhydargaeau. However, during the schism of 1799 the two churches parted company, Ffynnonhenry remaining Calvinistic, and Rhydargaeau becoming a General Baptist church under Davies's charge. He is known to have supported the Welsh Wesleyan mission to west Wales, and to have preached together with Moses Williams (d. 1819) to the Welsh Wesleyans at Carmarthen in 1806. Around 1820, Ffynnonhenry invited him to return, to become their joint pastor with David Evans (1778-1866), and he remained there for the next 40 years.

As in season six and for the first time since season ten, the Playoffs were prerecorded and hence no interactive viewer voting component or subsequent results shows. As in seasons 9, 10, and 12, four previously eliminated artists were chosen by the coaches to come back for the Playoffs. This season is the first to have the Playoffs taped on the same stage as the Battles and the Knockouts. There was no public vote in the playoffs. Instead, each of the coaches selected three of their own artists to eliminate.

It fought with the Army of Tennessee in the Western Theater for the duration of the war. Originally organized to serve for twelve months it was reorganized for the war in 1862. Sent east to fight in the Carolinas Campaign in 1865 it was consolidated with the 19th South Carolina Infantry Regiment and formed Walker's Battalion, South Carolina Infantry. The unit surrendered with General Joseph E. Johnston and the Army of Tennessee at Bennett Place on April 26, 1865. Out of 2189 men listed on the regimental muster rolls throughout the conflict only 55 enlisted men remained to be paroled. ==Organization and equipment== Organization The bill to organize a force for State defence passed by the Legislature of South Carolina in December, 1860, and divided the State into ten districts in each of which one regiment was to be formed. The district from which the 10th Regiment was to be formed embraced Horry, Marion, Georgetown, Williamsburg, and part of Charleston District. Assembling at Camp Marion, near Georgetown, on May 19; its organization was completed on May 31, 1861: By election the field officers were: *Col. Arthur M. Manigault, Commanding Officer *Lt. Col. James F. Pressley *Maj. Richard G. White *Capt. C. Irvine Walker, Adjutant *Capt. B. H. Wilson, Quartermaster *Capt. T. Nelson Britton, Commissary *Dr. P. P. Bonneau, Surgeon *Dr. J. P.

McMillian *Company M - \\"Horry Dixie Boys\\", from Horry County - Capt. W.J. Taylor Before the official formation of the regiment some of its companies were already active. The Georgetown Rifle Guards were stationed on South Island Redoubt while the Brooks Guards were stationed on North Island. Equipment The government issued uniforms to 8 of the companies, while companies A, B, E, and K uniformed themselves. Tenting and camp equipment was furnished by the government according to army regulations. Initially there were four kinds of arms in the regiment. Company A was armed with English Enfield rifles, a contribution from its Captain. Company B used the M1841 Mississippi rifle. Company E sported Harper's Ferry rifled muskets and the other companies used smoothbore muskets. Over the course of war the regiment partially adopted the Austrian Lorenz rifle, and after the Battle of Franklin in November 1864 it finally unified in the use of the Enfield rifle. ==War service== 1861–1862 In August the Regiment was transferred to the Confederate Government. Colonel Manigault, a veteran of the Mexican–American War, had trained, drilled and shaped his 12 companies with the assistance of the cadets from The Citadel, The Military College of South Carolina; and the regiment soon gained a reputation for its disciplined appearance. The regiment moved to the coast and was stationed at Cat Island Redoubt, located between Winyah Bay and Santee River; and went into garrison and winter quarters. While there the training continued, even with many of the men suffering from typhoid fever, measles and mumps. In March 1862 it marched to Charleston where it was reorganized and enlisted for the duration of the war. On April 12 it was sent west to join the forces of General P.G.T. Beauregard in Mississippi. Passing through Augusta, Atlanta, Montgomery and Mobile they arrived at Corinth on April 25 and 26. Initially put in a brigade under command of Gen. Donelson the regiment was soon brigaded with the 24th, 28th, and 34th Alabama Infantry, as well as with the 19th South Carolina Regiment. Under command of Brig. Gen. James H. Trapier it was part of Withers' Division of the II Corps in the Army of Mississippi. In April and May it participated in the Siege of Corinth and was used on picket and fatigue duty until the army retreated to Tupelo, Mississippi. Recuperating and reorganizing in Tupelo Col. Manigault commenced his drill and fostered his regiment's reputation. When Gen. Trapier was relieved of his command by Gen. Bragg the command of the brigade developed to Col. Manigault, and the regiment was led by its Lieutenant Colonel, James Pressley. In late July the brigade was transferred to Chattanooga by train as part of the army renamed to Army of Tennessee under command of Gen. Braxton Bragg; the II Corps now being Polk's. In November Col. Manigault was recommended to be promoted to Brigadier General by Gen. Withers.The War of the Rebellion : a compilation of the official records of the Union and Confederate armies I-XX-2, p. 508 The 10th took part in the Confederate Heartland Offensive, including the Battle of Munfordville, and afterwards in the Stones River Campaign and the Battle of Murfreesboro. Battle of Murfreesboro On December 28, 1862, Manigault's brigade moved into position for the battle. On December 29, Union cavalry, including the 15th Pennsylvania Cavalry, probed the skirmishers composed of companies A, B and C, but were repulsed.Walker, pp. 87–94The War of the Rebellion: A Compilation of the Official Records of the Union and Confederate Armies I-XX-1, p. 218 On December 31 the brigade was in the left center of the line, being part of the first line and laying opposite of Brig.

Then Robert's Illinois brigade fell on the advancing brigade's right—which was made of the 10th and 19th South Carolina, supported by Union artillery of Bush's and Houghtaling's batteries. With support from the neighboring Tennessee brigade the counterattacks were stopped, and in the following advance around 9 a.m. the Carolina regiments captured two 6-pounders from Bush's battery when Sheridan's division was completely driven back.

Col. Pressley. During the summer the consolidated 10th-19th South Carolina Infantry participated in the Tullahoma Campaign and the Middle Tennessee Operations. Retreating towards Georgia with the rest of the army the 10th arrived at Chattanooga on July 8, 1863. When on the same day Manigault finally received his promotion to Brigadier General, Pressley was promoted to Colonel of the regiment. Major J.T. Porcher took his place as Lt. Col., himself being followed by Maj. R.G. White of the 19th. As the Regimental Adjutant Capt. C.I. Walker was officially appointed as Adjutant to the General his place was taken by L.R. Stark.Walker, pp. 96-99 Battle of Chickamauga Spending the August with marches on September 18 Manigault's brigade, a part of Hindman's division in Polk's corps, was positioned at the left of the Confederate lines near Chickamauga guarding the river crossing near the Lee & Gordon's Mill. On the next day the whole corps shifted north and took the positions previously held by Hood's corps. During the night the army was reorganized for the battle. As Gen. Polk was appointed to command the right wing of the army, his corps was split and Hindman's division was attached to the wing of Gen. James Longstreet, who just arrived from the Army of Northern Virginia. A general assault by the whole army on the morning of the 20th was planned, and the brigade formed the left of the division, now commanded by Gen. J. Patton Anderson. It was now the extreme left of the assault column; and faced elements of the Union XX Corps.The War of the Rebellion : a compilation of the official records of the Union and Confederate armies. I-XXX-2, pp. Starting its advance between 10 a.m. and 11 a.m. it strayed left, dividing the division front. In this split the 10th South Carolina was split, too. Several companies of under Col. Pressley attached themselves to the brigade on the right, commanded by Brig. Gen. Zachariah Deas. This brigade drove back two brigades of Davis's division and defeated Col. Bernard Laiboldt's brigade of Sheridan's division. Sheridan's two remaining brigades finally checked the Confederate advance west of the Dyer field near the Widow Glenn House. The greater portion of the regiment stayed with Manigault. The brigade crossed the field east of the Widow Glenn's house when Union Col. Wilder's mounted infantry brigade launched a strong counterattack. Armed with Spencer repeating rifles it drove Manigault's brigade around and through what became known as \\"Bloody Pond\\".The War of the Rebellion : a compilation of the official records of the Union and Confederate armies. I-XXX-2, pp. Later on that day, when the Union army took its defensive position on Horseshoe Ridge, the exhausted division was on the Confederate left again; Manigault's brigade now being the division's right. Facing Gordon Granger's Reserve Corps, supported by artillery Hindman's and Johnson's divisions tried to break the Union's lines, but the federals, partially armed with Colt revolving rifles, repulsed the assaulting Confederates. Fading daylight ended all hostilities, and the nightly retreat of Rosecrans' army ended the battle.The War of the Rebellion : a compilation of the official records of the Union and Confederate armies. I-XXX-2, pp. Late 1863 When the Army of Tennessee advanced in the wake of its victory at Chickamauga it took position on Missionary Ridge and lay siege on Chattanooga, surrounding the Union army.

He discovered and named dynein, and demonstrated energy source as ATP is sufficient for dynein to walk on microtubules. In 2017, he and Ronald Vale received the Shaw Prize for their research on microtubule motor proteins. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Great Britain in 1983. The Society stated: :He discovered, named and characterised the founding member of the dynein ATPase family of motor proteins and other microtubular components in cilia and flagella. By elegantly combining biochemical techniques with light and electron microscopy, he greatly advanced our understanding of microtubule-based motility, particularly by the direct visual demonstration of active dynein-dependent sliding between adjacent microtubules in structurally weakened flagella. See \\"Professor Ian Gibbons FRS\\" The Royal Society == Early life and education == Gibbons's passion for science stems from his interest in radio. He entered Queen Elizabeth's Grammar School in Faversham in 1943, where he developed an interest towards applied physics. Following 18 months in the Royal Air Force as a radar engineer, he was admitted into King's College at the University of Cambridge in 1951 to read physics. He graduated with a bachelor's degree and then, in 1957, a PhD degree from Cambridge. His PhD research concerns using electron microscopes to study the organisation of chromosomes during mitosis and meiosis. Gibbons then went to the University of Pennsylvania as a postdoctoral researcher, where he stayed for 1 year. He subsequently moved to the Department of Biology, Harvard University, to take up the post of director of the newly founded electron microscopy laboratory. == Academic and research career == While at Harvard, Gibbons studied the structure of cilia and flagella of a protozoan called Tetrahymena with electron microscopes. In 1963, he discovered a novel protein on microtubules and published its pictures. Two years later, he purified two regions of the protein, known as its two \\"arms\\", naming the protein \\"dynein\\". During his last year at Harvard, Gibbons demonstrated the protein making up microtubules was distinct from actin, in that the former was associated with guanine nucleotides while the latter with adenine nucleotides , but refrained from naming it; Hideo Mohri from the University of Tokyo named it tubulin afterwards. Gibbons moved to the Kewalo Marine Laboratory, University of Hawaii at Manoa, in 1967 as an associate professor. He found the cilia of sea urchin sperms easier to work with than the cilia and flagella of Tetrahymena. In 1969, he was promoted to professor of biophysics. Throughout the 1970s, Gibbons and his wife Barbara showed the sliding of microtubules caused cilia motility (known as the sliding tubule mechanism), and that this sliding was dependent on the energy generated from ATP hydrolysis by ATPase. When microtubules visibly slid out of the ends of the flagellar fiber, the flagella disintegrated. He then extended the mechanism to mammals, confirming the motility mechanism of bull sperm cilia is the same as that for sea urchins. After these findings, Gibbons switched his focus to the molecular biology of dyneins, and determined the DNA sequence of the largest subunit of dynein in 1991. In 1993, he became the director of the Kewalo Marine Laboratory. Ian and Barbara Gibbons retired from the University of Hawaii at Manoa in 1997; he went to the University of California, Berkeley as a research scientist in the laboratory of Beth Burnside. In 2009, Burnside closed her laboratory, and Gibbons became a visiting researcher. == Honours and awards == * Shaw Prize in Life Science and Medicine (2017) * International Prize for Biology, Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (1995) * E.B.

On Metacritic, it received an average critic score of 78, based on 14 reviews, indicating \\"generally favourable reviews\\". Tim Sendra of Allmusic described it as a \\"remarkably coherent and listenable album that goes down very smooth, but not without the occasional moment of real emotion or foot-tapping fun\\". In a five-star review for The Guardian, Jon Dennis praised each member, writing that \\"All provide great tunes...and they entertain rather than indulge in introspection\\" and described the band as \\"much more than the sum of its parts\\".

It is native to central and northern Europe and Asia but has been accidentally introduced into North America where it has become invasive. The larvae feed on the needles of pine trees, especially those of the white pine (Pinus strobus). In North America it is known as the introduced pine sawfly or the imported pine sawfly. It is also known as the white pine sawfly because of its preference for feeding on the white pine, but this name is confusing because another sawfly, Neodiprion pinetum, whose larvae also feed on this tree, is itself known as the \\"white pine sawfly\\". ==Description== The adult male is between in length, black apart from the underside of the abdomen which is sometimes reddish-brown. Antennae are black and bipectinate (feather-like), and legs are yellow except for the trochanters and the base of the femora which are brownish-black. The female is between long, with a black head and thorax and usually a yellow and black abdomen, although some individuals are dark. Antennae are black and serrate (saw-like), and legs are yellow with dusky bases. Larvae have black heads and resemble the caterpillars of lepidopterans. Females have six instars and males have five. The first three instars are yellowish-green, and the later instars have black longitudinal stripes with patches of yellow and white on a bluish and black background. ==Distribution== D. similis is native to central and northern Europe (including Fennoscandia), Russian Siberia (as far as the Lake Baikal region), and China. It was first detected in North America in 1914 in Connecticut and has since spread to much of the eastern United States and Canada, wherever Pinus strobus is to be found. It feeds on other species of pine, but seems to favour P. strobus where it is available. ==Hosts== In its natural range, the larvae feed on several species of pine including Pinus sylvestris, Pinus mugo, Pinus cembra and Pinus sibirica as well as such introduced species as Pinus strobus and Pinus contorta. In North America, as well as Pinus strobus, it feeds on Pinus resinosa, Pinus banksiana and P. sylvestris. ==Ecology== Diprion similis is arrhenotokous, that is it exhibits a form of parthenogenesis in which unfertilized eggs develop into male offspring. Fertilised eggs develop in the normal way into male and female offspring, n = 14 for haploid males and 2n = 28 for diploid females. Adults emerge in spring or later in the year and are active for most of the summer. The female makes a slit in a pine needle with her ovipositor and lays about ten eggs. Unmated females can lay viable eggs and these develop into male offspring. Newly hatched larvae are gregarious but later stages live independently. They feed on the needles of the pine until ready to pupate. The first generation spin cocoon in July and emerge in August. The second generation tends to drop to the ground and spend the winter in a cocoon as a prepupa, pupating in the spring. Some may remain in a prepupal state for a longer period of up to three years. Sawflies such as this species that have been introduced into North America have found little competition from native sawfly species and become invasive pests. They have few predators or parasites in the New World and their parthenogenetic abilities have allowed them to thrive. Sawflies employ pheromones to attract the opposite sex and facilitate breeding. It has been found that the pheromone emitted by D. similis contains the (2S,3R,7R)-propionate form of the isomer of 3,7-dimethylpentadecan-2-yl as its main component, while Neodiprion pinetum, which also feeds on white pines, uses the (2S,3S,7S)-acetate isomer as its main constituent. ==Gallery== Image:Diprion simile 1 beentree.jpg Image:Diprion simile 3 beentree.jpg Image:Diprion simile 4 beentree.jpg == References == Category:Tenthredinoidea Category:Pest insects Category:Insects described in 1834 ","title":"Diprion similis"},{"id":"54118160","text":"Ficus petiolaris, commonly known as the petiolate fig and rock fig, is a fig that is endemic to Mexico from Baja California and Sonora south to Oaxaca.

Ballantyne was a candidate in the February 2020 Scottish Conservative Party leadership election, which she lost to Jackson Carlaw. ==Early life and career== Michelle Cross was born on 28 November 1962 in Ashton-under-Lyne, the oldest of four siblings. Michelle studied nursing at The London Hospital in East London, beginning her career working as a staff nurse in an Intensive Care Unit before progressing into a finance and management position at South West Thames Regional Health Authority. In December 1983 Michelle married Neil Ballantyne, at that time an officer in the King's Own Scottish Borderers, with whom she now has 6 children. Neil left the British Army in the late 1980s, and they moved to the Scottish Borders in 1990 to established a manufacturing business with her husband in Walkerburn. During this period Ballantyne continued to work as a nurse and within social care, whilst also completing an Honours degree as a mature student at Heriot Watt University in Galashiels. After graduation, she returned to Health Service Management in 2000, managing an Acute Medicine department in Edinburgh. Ballantyne and her husband sold their house and became tenants to enable Michelle to work closer to home. Ballantyne took a position in 2005 as head of an independent local charity providing specialist drug and alcohol support to children, families and offenders.https://www.michelleballantyne.org.uk/about-michelle-ballantyne It was through interaction with the local council during this period that Ballantyne became involved with community politics. ==Political career== Ballantyne was first elected to the Scottish Borders Council as representative for Selkirkshire in 2012, and then lead the Conservative group at the 2017 Scottish Local Elections. The Conservatives gained 5 seats and subsequently partnered with the Independent group to take control of the council from the incumbent SNP, Liberal Democrat and Independent alliance.https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-south-scotland-39856649 Following the election, Ballantyne was invited to join the Scottish Parliament and sworn in as an MSP on 23 May 2017 to replaced Rachael Hamilton, who had resigned her seat to contest the Ettrick, Roxburgh and Berwickshire by- election, 2017 on 8 June. Shortly after she joined the Scottish Parliament, Ballantyne was appointed to the role of spokesperson for Childcare and Early Years, while on 3 May 2018 Ballantyne was promoted by Ruth Davidson to the Scottish Conservative front bench as spokesperson for Social Security. Ballantyne was a candidate in the 2020 Scottish Conservative Party leadership election, which she lost to Jackson Carlaw. She was dropped from the Conservative frontbench team by Carlaw in a reshuffle shortly after the election. On 18 February Carlaw told ITV's 'Representing Borders' that Ballantyne would be moved to an as yet unspecified position.https://twitter.com/ITVBorderRB/status/1229830528494428160 Political controversies During a meeting of the Scottish Parliament's Social Security Committee Ballantyne claimed that \\"there’s no such thing as a bedroom tax\\", disagreeing that restrictions to benefits are equivalent to the payment of tax.

She later refused to apologise for her remarks, and accused critics of having an \\"emotional reaction\\". During an interview Ballantyne accused the SNP of politicising the two child cap and suggested that there was no hard evidence as to why the use of foodbanks has increased. She reiterated these views in January 2020 when contesting the Scottish Conservative leadership. Criticising the SNP's record on Healthcare within a speech in the Scottish Parliament, Ballantyne said she would be \\"quite happy\\" if the Scottish Government had no role in the running the NHS in Scotland. ==Voluntary work== Ballantyne was previously an Adult Volunteer in the Air Training Corps, during which she was commissioned as a Flight Lieutenant in the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve (Training Branch).

The battle also became the longest urban battle in the modern history of the Philippines. According to the Philippine government, the clashes began during an offensive in Marawi to capture Isnilon Hapilon, the leader of the ISIL-affiliated Abu Sayyaf group, after receiving reports that Hapilon was in the city, possibly to meet with militants of the Maute group. A deadly firefight erupted when Hapilon's forces opened fire on the combined Army and police teams and called for reinforcements from the Maute group, an armed group that pledged allegiance to the Islamic State and which is believed to be responsible for the 2016 Davao City bombing, according to military spokesmen. Maute group militants attacked Camp Ranao and occupied several buildings in the city, including Marawi City Hall, Mindanao State University, a hospital and the city jail. They also occupied the main street and set fire to Saint Mary's Cathedral, Ninoy Aquino School and Dansalan College, run by the United Church of Christ in the Philippines (UCCP). The militants also took a priest and several churchgoers hostage. The Armed Forces of the Philippines stated that some of the terrorists were foreigners who had been in the country for a long time, offering support to the Maute group in Marawi. Their main objective was to raise an ISIL flag at the Lanao del Sur Provincial Capitol and declare a wilayat or provincial ISIL territory in Lanao del Sur. On October 17, 2017, the day after the deaths of militant leaders Omar Maute and Isnilon Hapilon, President Duterte declared Marawi was \\"liberated from terrorist influence\\". Then on October 23, 2017, Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana announced that the five-month battle against the terrorists in Marawi had finally ended. ==Background== The Battle of Marawi was a consequence of the Philippines' long struggle against terrorism, in the aftermath of September 11, 2001 (9/11) terrorist attacks in the USA, against the Abu Sayyaf Group (ASG) then linked with Al-Qaeda and now with the Islamic State. But the Battle of Marawi has been associated with the Maute Group being its stronghold. The Maute group had established a stronghold in Lanao del Sur since February 2016 and was blamed for the 2016 Davao City bombing and two attacks in Butig, Lanao del Sur, a town located south of Marawi, in 2016. Since the militant group's founding in 2013, the Philippine government has downplayed the threat of ISIS in the Philippines. Following the February 2016 Butig clash with the Maute group, then-President Benigno Aquino III discounted the possibility of the Islamic State's presence in the country. He said that those behind the attack were just mercenaries wanting to be recognized by the Middle East-based terror group. The Abu Sayyaf group, blamed for deadly bombings and kidnappings in the past, had also pledged allegiance to the Islamic State movement in the summer of 2014. One of its leaders, Isnilon Hapilon, was listed as among the world's most wanted terrorists by the US State Department with a reward of up to for his capture. Following the abduction and subsequent beheading of Canadian businessman John Ridsdel in April 2016, Aquino disclosed that he had received death threats from the jihadist group, and that the Abu Sayyaf also plotted to kidnap his sister Kris, and Manny Pacquiao. Aquino also identified Hapilon behind attempts to convert and recruit inmates at the New Bilibid Prison to their cause, and embark on a bombing campaign in Metro Manila, which he said was \\"part of their effort to gain favor with ISIS.\\" In November 2016, President Rodrigo Duterte confirmed the Maute group's affiliation with the Islamic State and President Duterte even revealed that the siege of Marawi City was also related to narcoterrorism. But the Philippine military maintained that ISIL had not established links with militants in the Philippines. Amidst fierce fighting in Butig on November 30, 2016, Duterte, in a command briefing in Lanao del Sur, warned the Maute group: \\"Ayaw ko makipag- away sa inyo. Ayaw ko makipag-patayan, (I do not want a fight with you. I don't want us killing each other) but please, do not force my hand. I cannot be forever traveling here every month para lang makipag-usap (just to talk), at pagtalikod ko patayan nanaman (and when I turn around, there's killing again). I do not want to mention anything, but please do not force my hand into it.\\" On December 2, 2016, as the military regained control of Butig, the retreating Maute fighters reportedly left a note threatening to behead Duterte and the military. On December 12, 2016, in a speech before the Wallace Business Forum Dinner, Duterte dared the Maute group to attack Marawi, stating: \\"Because they (the Maute group) threatened to go down from the mountains to burn down Marawi? Go ahead, be my guest. We will wait for you there. Walang problema (No problem).\\" From April to May 2017, Abu Sayyaf fought in clashes with Philippine security forces in Bohol which resulted in the deaths of three soldiers, a policeman and ten militants. Prelude to the battle The Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) stated that the fighting in Marawi was due to a raid conducted by the military in coordination with the Philippine National Police, contrary to earlier reports that the clash was initiated by the militant groups. Rolando Bautista, commanding general of the Philippine Army 1st Infantry Division, stated that they had received reports of impending activity two or three weeks ahead of time. As the combined military and local police team conducted zoning in Marawi to validate the information that suspicious personalities including Omar and Abdullah Maute were consolidating in the area, their team instead spotted Isnilon Hapilon. According to the Philippine military, Hapilon had been appointed as emir of the IS forces in the Philippines and was consolidating his group with the Maute and other terrorist groups. After residents of Marawi reported the presence of an armed group within their locale and after the AFP verified the information, the military launched a \\"surgical operation\\" to capture Hapilon only to stumble into an entire city of armed men. ==Timeline== May  23–27 May  ;23 May Listing of inmates of the Malabang District Jail at a PNP checkpoint Firefights between government forces and militants began at approximately 2:00 PM local in the afternoon of May 23, 2017. The Peace and Conflict Journalism Network reported that the clash occurred in the Basak Malutlut area of the city as Hapilon's forces called for reinforcements from the Maute group. Maute fighters occupied the Amai Pakpak Hospital and ordered the PhilHealth employees out of the facility. The fighters allegedly replaced the Philippine flag hoisted in the hospital with the Black Standard used by the Islamic State group. A staff member of the hospital later denied that this happened. The 103rd Brigade of the Philippine Army stationed at Camp Ranao was also attacked by at least 500 Maute group militants. A number of militants were then seen waving their ISIS black flags as they roamed the streets of Marawi. The whole city was put on lockdown as several buildings and houses were set ablaze by members of the Maute group. Dozens of gunmen occupied the Marawi City Hall as 107 inmates escaped from the Marawi City Jail and the Malabang District Jail 39 after the Maute attacks. Power and communication lines were also shut down due to the continued hostilities. Roads leading to Marawi were blocked by both government security forces and Maute militants. Civilians were reported to have been abducted by the Maute group, including a priest and several parishioners of the Cathedral of Our Lady Help of Christians as the group demanded that the government stop its offensive against them. The clashes sparked a mass evacuation of the city with residents fleeing by the thousands, causing traffic congestion on the highway to Iligan and Cagayan de Oro. At least eleven civilians had been killed in the ongoing firefight, two of which the Lanao del Sur Provincial Disaster Office identified as ambulance drivers who were stopped by Maute militants while responding to an emergency call. Nine of those civilians were on board a truck when they were stopped by Maute militants at a checkpoint and shot dead with their hands tied. A police officer was also reported to have been beheaded by the militants. ;24 May On 24 May, additional government forces arrived at the Laguindingan Airport as the military regained control of the Amai Pakpak Hospital. 120 civilians used as a human shield by the Maute group were rescued from the hospital. The military had also recaptured the city hall and the Mindanao State University. ;25 May On Thursday 25 May, fresh fighting took place near the Lanao del Sur Provincial Capitol in the Marawi city center. Black-clad Maute and Abu Sayyaf militants were still spotted on the city's major roads and bridges. The militants also reportedly took control of the Lanao del Sur Electric Cooperative in Gadungan village. The AFP said there were still three or four dozen Maute, including Isnilon Hapilon, remaining in Marawi. The Philippine air force launched strikes against remnants of the group in three nearby villages. Reports came in that two Malaysian terrorists who were with Isnilon Hapilon in Marawi to push for the creation of the Islamic State in Southeast Asia were among those militants killed late Thursday. Intelligence sources also said that an Indonesian and a Saudi Arabian linked to ISIS were also killed in skirmishes in the city. The AFP said that 26 of the around 50 Maute militants in the area were killed and 30 government soldiers were wounded. ;26 May At a press briefing in Davao City, AFP Spokesperson Brig. Gen. Restituto Padilla stated that some of the terrorists were foreigners who had been in the country for quite some time, offering support to the Maute group in Marawi. He noted that of the twelve killed in a recent engagement, six were from out of the country. Amid continuing operations against the terror groups, several houses, including the residence of Lanao del Sur Representative Jun Papandayan, were seen burning as residents also reported seeing civilians killed after the military dropped bombs on Maute positions. Sources said the houses were targeted because of the presence of Maute snipers. According to AFP Western Mindanao Command chief Lt. Gen. Carlito Galvez Jr., dwellings in the area were intentionally set on fire so as to keep them from being used as cover by Maute fighters. Limited air strikes were also used on Maute sniper positions. Galvez stated that no civilians were reported killed in the air strikes, and it was his hope they could keep military casualties low as well. As of May 26, 2017, the priest Fr. Chito Suganob and his companions who were taken hostage by the Maute group on the first day of the clashes, were still being held by the group according to Marawi bishop Edwin de la Peña. ;27 May Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) from Marawi staying in Iligan 1st Infantry Division spokesman Lt. Col. Jo-Ar Herrera told reporters: \\"We have identified where they are consolidating so we are doing surgical air strikes to destroy the local terrorist group.\\" The military troops and Special Action Force continued their clearing operations by checking each house and building in the city's downtown area. During the operations on Saturday, troops had encountered child warriors as young as 10 years old armed with M-16 rifles being used by the Maute group. By 27 May, 90 percent of Marawi's population of more than 200,000 people had been evacuated to neutral grounds, particularly in Iligan.  28–31 May  ;28 May The regional military spokesman Jo-Ar Herrera reported 19 civilians, some of whom were women and children, had been killed in Marawi by 27 May. Eight civilians were found dead on the side of the road on the outskirts of Marawi on the previous Sunday (22 May). The victims were later identified as local carpenters who were part of an evacuation convoy; the militants stopped the convoy and then massacred those who could not recite verses from the Quran. A signed note was found attached to one of them, the author indicating that the victims had \\"betrayed their faith\\". Authorities said that 2,000 civilians were trapped in militant-controlled areas. Reports came in that 28 Malaysians had joined the Maute group. Citing intelligence sources in Manila, a Malaysian newspaper reported that the Malaysians arrived early last week supposedly for a religious event and may have also taken up arms, a conclusion they arrived at after 2 Malaysians were killed in firefights. The ongoing clash also raised concerns in Jakarta that extremist groups in Indonesia could be drawn to join the fight in Marawi as well. Malacañang Palace Communications Secretary Martin Andanar appealed for foreign support in fighting the extremist groups in southern Philippines. In an interview with China Central Television, Andanar said \\"We need support, be that economic support, ideological support to fight the ISIS. Now, it is an international issue. We are doing our best to contain the ISIS and to stop it from spreading in the country.\\" ;29 May The \\"Peace Corridor\\" set up by combined forces of the Philippine government and Moro Islamic Liberation Front to hasten humanitarian efforts in support of affected Marawi residents. The orange line shows the scope of the corridor which covers Marawi itself and the towns of Marantao, Balindong, Tugaya, Bacolod-Kalawi, Madalum, Madamba, Ganassi, and Malabang. The death toll in Marawi had reached 100, the Philippine military confirmed Monday, including 19 civilians and 61 militants. The military had also retaken most of Marawi previously occupied by the extremist groups. Presidential Spokesperson Ernesto Abella said Monday that only small areas in the city remained under militants' control. Also on Monday, the Philippine military reported that the Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters from neighboring Maguindanao joined the Maute and Abu Sayyaf groups in Marawi and that the Abu Sayyaf leader Isnilon Hapilon remained holed up in the city. Amid continuing air strikes and as the militants fought government forces on 29 May, fourteen hostages managed to escape their Maute captors. The men said they were part of a group of 20 who had been taken captive on 27 May while evacuating the city. Their captors forced them to film a video appeal to Duterte to accede to the militants' demands or the hostages would be killed. One of the hostages was indeed beheaded, they reported, and one drowned during the escape. A spokesman for Nur Misuari said Misuari ordered the Moro National Liberation Front to fight any Maute in Lanao del Sur. Misuari offered a unit of 500 to 700 MNLF fighters to help fight the extremists. Luis Jalandoni of the National Democratic Front stated his group was willing to help as well. The Moro Islamic Liberation Front and the government decided to implement a \\"peace corridor\\" in Lanao del Sur as part of an effort to hasten humanitarian operations for displaced Marawi residents. The corridor spans from Marawi proper down to the Malabang town. ;30 May In a video released on 30 May, abducted priest Fr. Teresito Soganub pleaded the government to stop their offensive against the militants and withdraw all their forces from Marawi and Lanao del Sur. Marawi Bishop Edwin dela Peña says that Soganub was relaying the Maute group's demands in exchange for the safety of Suganob and other people taken as hostages. The Marawi city center remains under control of the Maute militants, as two of three bridges leading to the Marawi city center, the Mapandi and Bayabao bridges, still contained roadblocks and enemy vehicles with a black flag flying in front of them. The Philippine Marines had been able to recover eighteen high-powered firearms, police and military uniforms, and black flags from their two-day clearing operations in Marawi. They also reported that eight terrorists had been killed Tuesday. In a joint statement from the Philippine government and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front released Tuesday, Murad Ebrahim said the MILF welcomed the President's invitation for its forces to extend humanitarian assistance to civilians still trapped in Marawi. ;31 May BRP Tarlac in Iligan offloading military units meant to augment government forces fighting in Marawi AFP spokesperson Restituto Padilla said Wednesday that government forces have retaken 90 percent of Marawi, including parts of the city center and the two bridges that lead to it. According to Padilla, the surge in the number of militants might have something to do with the sympathizers they freed from the city jail, but that the military managed to secure all entry and exit points to prevent possible reinforcements for the militants. The Associated Press reported that eleven soldiers were killed and seven others were wounded by friendly fire in a military air strike as government security forces struggled to drive off remnants of the militant groups from the city. An AFP spokesman said the incident happened when a SIAI-Marchetti SF.260 turboprop aircraft providing close air support \\"over militant positions in Marawi\\" dropped a bomb that accidentally hit an army unit locked in close-range combat with the militants. Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana ordered an investigation on the incident. At least eight militants have surrendered to government troops on Wednesday. According to AFP spokesman Restituto Padilla, the militants surrendered to the unit of Marine Task Force Tiger Tawitawi Commanding general Custodio Parcon and \\"have provided very, very valuable intelligence.\\" It was the first time that members of the militant groups have surrendered since laying siege to Marawi on May 23, 2017. Additional marines and relief supplies arrived via transport ship on 31 May. June  June 1–3  ;June 1 In a news conference, Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana announced that eight foreign militants had been killed in Marawi, five of which they have identified as Malaysian, Indonesian, Saudi Arabian, Yemeni and a Chechen. Lorenzana also said they have revised their estimate of the number of militants involved in the Marawi attacks since last week from the initial 100 militants to 500 militants, which he said was composed of 260 Maute militants, 100 Abu Sayyaf militants under Isnilon Hapilon, and the rest from other local militant organizations. He said 280 militants have fled the city, some of them mixing with civilians in neighboring towns while an estimated 50 to 100 militants remained in Marawi. A friendly fire incident took place in Marawi. Two Philippine Air Force planes bombed rebel positions, but one plane missed its target and instead hit government troops on the ground, killing 10 soldiers. Following the incident, Senate President Aquilino Pimentel III asked for a review of the Philippine military's strategy in the ongoing campaign against the militant groups in Marawi. Senator Antonio Trillanes called the incident \\"tragic and unfortunate\\" as he called on the military to ensure that similar incidents will never happen again. Senator Panfilo Lacson encouraged the public to support the AFP as well as the investigation being conducted. ;June 2 Malacañang Palace spokesman Ernesto Abella dispelled speculations that the 2017 Resorts World Manila attack that transpired in the early hours of June 2, 2017 in Pasay was connected to the ongoing military offensive against the Maute group in Marawi or to ISIS. He also denied any possible terrorism link in the incident. In an update to the media on the situation in Marawi, the AFP spokesperson said that the militants remained holed up in commercial buildings in the city center and that they believe Isnilon Hapilon to be still in Marawi. He also acknowledged that their earlier June 2 deadline for completely taking back the city from the militant groups would not be met as they continued to put up significant resistance. The Indonesian Foreign Ministry through its embassy in Manila was able to rescue 17 of their citizens from Marawi on Thursday with help from the AFP. ;June 3 On June 3, 2017, Duterte and Nur Misuari (founding chairman of the Moro National Liberation Front) made an agreement that 2000 MNLF fighters would be enlisted into the Philippine military and join in the fighting in Marawi. However, a few days later, both the Armed Forces of the Philippines and Duterte himself issued statements that this would not be happening soon.  June 4–10  ;June 4 A convoy of Filipino soldiers participating in the Battle of Marawi in transit On June 4, 2017, a ceasefire agreement was reached between the Philippine government and the ISIL fighters remaining in the center of Marawi. This ceasefire had been facilitated by MILF, which had been asked by Duterte to help negotiate a settlement by which civilians still trapped in the city could be evacuated. The ceasefire was to begin at 8 A.M. and last for four hours. However, the Philippines Military units in the city refused to accept the terms of the ceasefire, and only allowed the evacuation of those individuals on the edges of the areas controlled by ISIL. Fighting in the city broke out at 9 A.M. The army claimed that 179 civilians were evacuated, while a presidential spokesperson claimed that 134 were evacuated—fewer than on preceding days—leaving about 2,000 civilians trapped in the city. Two soldiers were injured. Authorities claimed that the total number of civilian casualties had increased from 20 to 38, all killed by militants, while local residents claimed that airstrikes had killed dozens of civilians. ;June 6 On June 6, 2017, police in Davao arrested Cayamora Maute, the 67-year-old patriarch of the leaders of the Maute group. He was arrested at a Task Force Davao checkpoint in Sirawan, Toril District. Cayamora was aboard a van wearing a surgical mask to avoid identification, when they were stopped at the checkpoint. ;June 9 Members of the government cabinet inspecting weapons retrieved by security forces from ASG-Maute militants. On June 9, 2017, the police received information and arrested the mother of the Maute terrorist group leaders, Ominta Romato Maute. Ominta, also known as Farhana, was arrested in the town of Masiu in Lanao del Sur, along with two other wounded family members and 7 other unidentified females. Also on June 9, it was reported that 13 Philippine Marines had been killed and 40 wounded during a clearing operation in Marawi. American Special Forces were deployed to the city in an advisory role.  June 11–17  ;June 11 On June 11, 2017, the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) on Sunday announced that it has so far killed 191 Maute group terrorists in the ongoing operations to clear Marawi. ;June 12 (Philippine Independence Day) On June 12, 2017, the Philippines' Independence day, the Armed Forces of the Philippines hoped that as of this day, Marawi siege will be over. The Philippine Government raised the symbolic Philippine Flag in several places in Marawi like the Marawi City Hall, Lanao del Sur Provincial Capitol, Camp Ranao, Mindanao State University, Amai Pakpak Hospital and several roads in the city. Philippine troops, Tanks, Rescue Van and trucks, Police cars, Patrol Cars, Army Service units and Heavy Tanks also carried a Philippine Flag which symbolizes that the roads they are roaming around are part of Philippine Territory to fight back to the Maute's black flag. However, the battle still continues. ;June 16 The Armed Forces of the Philippines announced that they have begun \\"normalization operations\\" and has begun cooperating with local government units in restoring the situation in Marawi back to normal. Clashes against militants continues. The Philippine Army stated that it had secured 90% of Marawi, on June 16, 2017.  June 18–24  ;June 19 The Armed Forces of the Philippines raided a Maute group safehouse, where they confiscated bags of shabu (methamphetamine hydrochloride) and related drug paraphernalia. Captain Eric Estrevillo of the 49th Infantry Battalion stated on a press conference that Maute group members use shabu to endure long battles, and in addition, looked \\"high\\" during combat. ;June 23 The Philippine government accepts Australia's offer to send two AP-3C Orion surveillance aircraft to assist the Armed Forces of the Philippines in Marawi. ;June 24 According to some news websites, the leader of Abu Sayyaf and the emir of the ISIS Philippines Isnilon Hapilon withdrew from Marawi, according to Lt. Gen. Carlito Galvez, the head of Western Mindanao Command. However, according to the Philippine Military, Isnilon's escape from the city is yet to be confirmed. The Philippine military declared an 8-hour ceasefire effective from 6:00 am of June 25 to give way for the observance of Eid el-Fitr but has maintained that the ceasefire will be lifted if the militants open fire at government forces or civilians.  June 25–30  ;June 25 (Start of Eid al-Fitr) At 6:50 a.m. amidst a congressional prayers for the Eid al-Fitr celebration held at the provincial capitol building, suspected gunshots were heard; a few minutes after the unilateral ceasefire by the government was declared. Entrance and exit points to Marawi remained guarded by government security forces against the influx of aid to Maute forces and assist civilians fleeing the city. Civilian volunteers along with Moro Islamic Liberation Front members took advantage of the ceasefire to repatriate civilians in opposing combat areas. ISIL-linked militant snipers opened fire at some government held positions but none of the clashes during the ceasefire were deemed major by the government. When the unilateral ceasefire expired, full-scale hostilities between government forces and militants continued. ;June 30 Two surveillance planes which were committed by Australia started conducting operations in Marawi. Filipino pilots and technicians were aboard the aircraft and assisted in relaying information to forces on the ground. The mission involving the Australian planes was set to place for two weeks. July July 1–15 A helicopter of the Philippine Air Force conducting airstrikes ;July 3 Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana said senior ISIS leader Isnilon Hapilon was believed to be hiding inside one of the mosques in Marawi. ;July 4 Presidential spokesman Ernesto Abella confirmed reports that Maute has looted an estimated P500 million worth of money from Marawi. Dansalan College, which had been used by the militants as a sniper roost, was retaken by government troops and 410 firearms were recovered since clearing operations began. ;July 12 A FA-50PH Golden Eagle fighter jet missed a target by resulting to a friendly fire which killed two soldiers and injured 11 others. All FA-50s were grounded pending an investigation while other air assets of the Philippine Air Force remained operating in Marawi. ;July 13 As of 7 p.m. on July 13, security forces have killed 394 terrorists and recovered 498 firearms. But government fatalities numbered 93 while the terrorists killed 45 civilians. Troops were able to rescue 1,723 people from the war-torn city but there are still some 300 civilians who are either trapped by the fighting or taken hostage by the terrorists. ;July 15 According to Brig. Gen. Resituto Padilla, the military is still assessing the security accession of the Battle of Marawi even though the fight was on its climax. Also, he noted that the campaign will continue before and even after Duterte's State of the Nation Address. He also noted that the AFP is doing its best to accomplish the 10–15 day deadline set by the president. July 16–31 ;July 18 National news agencies told the public that Duterte is considering to extend the martial law until the end of the year, which is December 31. The president insists that Martial Law is needed for faster rehabilitation of Marawi after the battle has ended. \\"I have come to the conclusion that the existing rebellion in Mindanao, which has prompted me to issue Proclamation No. 216 on May 23, 2017, will not be quelled completely by July 22, 2017,\\" Duterte said in a portion of his letter read aloud by the Executive Spokesperson Ernesto Abella. \\"For this reason, because public safety requires it, I call upon the Congress to extend until December 31, 2017 or for such a period of time as the Congress may determine the proclamation of martial law and the suspension of privilege of the writ of habeas corpus in the whole of Mindanao,\\" he added. ;July 19 Duterte said the Marawi crisis birthed a \\"newly evolving type of urban warfare\\" and his declaration of martial law in Mindanao is meant to fight this menace. In the full text of his letter to Congress released on that day, Duterte said this type of warfare is \\"characterized by the rebels' total disregard for civilian lives, cruelty to combatants and non-combatants alike, widespread looting, and pillaging of occupied communities.\\" He added this particular kind of warfare resulted in a \\"significant number of casualties,\\" and firefights that have prevented government troops from moving forward as well as clean up operations. ;July 20 Militant control over Mapandi Bridge ended when government forces took control of the structure. ;July 22 Through a joint session of the Philippines' Congress of the Philippines between the House of Representatives and the Senate, 16 senators, 261-18 Congressmen (Not one congressman abstained among those present), in favor of Duterte's request, voted for the extension of Proclamation Order No. 216—Imposing Martial Law in the whole Mindanao Region. This extension is valid until December 31, 2017. ;July 27 Agakhan Sharief, a Marawi Muslim cleric well known to the Maute clan, stated in November 2017 that the militants had asked Muslim leaders to urge Duterte in allowing the militants to escape in return for release of the hostages. He stated that they had asked for help in arranging for MILF to receive the hostages and escorting the militants out of the city. MILF's top peace negotiator, Mohagher Iqbal, confirmed the Maute proposal, but the government had ignored it. Delfin Lorenzana said that Duterte was aware of the offer but it was \\"too little, too late.\\" August ;August 18 Joint Task Force Marawi stated that the main battle area of the conflict is now confined to an area of covering 800 x 600 meters (2624.67 x 1968.5 feet). 400 buildings remained unclear from Maute elements by government forces. ;August 19 Maute militants are now confined to an area near the city's Grand Mosque with 40 civilians believed to be still held hostage. ;August 22 Government forces recaptured the Marawi City Police Station from the militants. Among the first features seized by ISIL-link militants in the early part of the battle, the police station is considered a \\"strategic location\\" by the Philippine military. ;August 23–24 The Grand Mosque where hostages by ISIL-linked militants were allegedly held was recaptured by government forces. However troops did not encounter any militants or the hostages when they entered the building. ;August 25–29 Captain Jo-Ann Petinglay, the spokesman of Joint Task Force Marawi, stated that the military had recaptured St. Mary's Catholic Cathedral, one of the first facilities occupied by the militants when they laid siege to the city. General Eduardo Año said that their leaders had been cornered in a battle zone restricted to 500 square metres. AFP meanwhile reported deaths of 10 militants who tried to sneak from Lake Lanao into Marawi as reinforcements. September thumb350pxThe following bridges above Agus River in Marawi were tagged as strategic by government forces along with dates when the government secured control over the structures; from top to bottom: ISIL-linked militants were concentrated on the west side of the river. ;September 1 The military took control of Bayabao Bridge after clashes which saw three soldiers and five militants killed. The structure which connects the conflict area to the city center is the second bridge recaptured by government forces. ;September 16 At around 17:00, government forces regained control over the Bato Mosque and the Amaitul Islamiya Marawi Foundation building which was used by ISIL-linked militants as their control center after a five-hour gunfight. At 17:00, Father Chito Soganub, who was reportedly held taken hostage few months ago was found by government forces abandoned by his captors near the mosque and was flown to Davao City to meet Duterte. ;September 24 Government forces secured Masiu Bridge also known as the Raya Madaya Bridge, one of the critical bridges which the militants had occupied and which leads to Lake Lanao, thus depriving the militants of an escape route. This was described by the government as a significant development in the battle. ;September 25 The Sultan Of Marawi, Sultan Hamidullah Atar, following President Rodrigo Duterte's earlier offer for a dialogue with the militants, offered to mediate between Maute Group and government forces to spare civilians still trapped inside the Marawi City and pave way for the possible release of hostages. Atar, who is also a conflict mediation professional, said talks with the Maute group can be done through the traditional mechanisms as they are also Maranaos. He related that he was able to link up with several members of the Maute group while he was also trapped in Marawi for 4 days. October ;October 10 Eight foreign militants, along with Isnilon Hapilon and Omar Maute, were acting as leaders of the ISIL-linked militants by October 10, according to the Philippine military. ;October 16 Isnilon Hapilon and Omar Maute were reportedly killed during the operation of rescuing the hostages on October 16, according to the statement released by Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana.\\"Top Marawi siege leaders killed in clashes\\" (WARNING: Graphic photo).

On the same day, the Philippine Army estimated that there were about 100 ISIL militants still fighting in Marawi. ;October 17 Following the deaths of Omar Maute and Isnilon Hapilon, Duterte declared the liberation of Marawi. At around 2PM, he addressed a crowd, saying: \\"I hereby declare Marawi City liberated from the terrorist influence that marks the beginning of rehabilitation of Marawi.\\" AFP Chief Gen. Eduardo Año said that the announcement meant that the conflict is substantially over now that the militants' leaders were killed. However, he maintained that there were skirmishes and that 20–30 militants with 20 hostages remained confined in a area in the city. ;October 18–19 Military officials stated on October 18 that 4 militants had been killed, while 10 soldiers were injured in fighting that continued after Duterte's \\"liberation\\" declaration. AFP said on the following day that the senior ISIL commander Mahmud Ahmad may have been among the 13 militants killed overnight, though they were still trying to verify his death with two rescued hostages stating that he had died and was buried.

Romeo Brawner, told a press conference that an estimated 30 people, including militants and some of their family members, were fighting to hold a fortified two-storey building next to Lake Lanao, which was the final ISIL- held building in Marawi. He added that soldiers were using loudspeakers to urge them to surrender and that the military didn't know who their leader was. Brawner also declared that the military had rescued the last 20 hostages by October 22. As of then, 919 militants and 165 security personnel had been killed in the battle. ;October 23 On October 23, the AFP cleared the final ISIL-held building in Marawi, fully recapturing the city. General Eduardo Año stated bodies of 42 dead militants were found in two buildings and a mosque in the battle zone, stating that it was possible that some militants were still hiding. The bodies also included two wives of Maute gunmen. Meanwhile, Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana announced the end of the battle and the end of combat operations in the area. He added that Bacu was believed to be among those 42 dead militants. Intelligence sources later stated that he was among the last three or four militants who could have escaped. However, in November, the Philippine Army stated that they believed that Amin Bacu had been killed during the battle, and that the remnants of the Maute group were now largely leaderless. == Casualties == Wake for soldiers who died in the conflict The casualties reported were as follows: * 978 militants killed * 12 militants captured * 168 government forces killed * 1,400+ government forces wounded * 87 civilians dead The police chief of Malabang, Romeo Enriquez, whose beheading was cited by Duterte as one of the bases for his declaration of martial law in a speech on May 24, 2017, was later found to be alive. The police officer actually killed was identified by the ARMM PNP as Senior Inspector Freddie Solar, a former police chief of Malabang and member of the Drug Enforcement Unit of the Lanao del Sur Provincial Police. The Armed Forces of the Philippines' highest-ranking combat casualty was Rommel Sandoval, a Captain commanding a company of Philippine Army Scout Rangers. Sandoval was posthumously conferred the Medal of Valor. Along with the casualties, much of Marawi was flattened in what was described as the heaviest urban fighting in the Philippines since World War II. Deaths of evacuees due to diseases According to the Philippines' Health Department report on June 16, at least 40 evacuees, who were staying outside evacuation centers, died of dehydration, while 19 others lost their lives as a result of diseases contracted due to living in congested evacuation camps. The following month, the Health Secretary denied this report and stated just four evacuees died of dehydration, instead of 40. However, in September, it was once again reported 40 evacuees had died due to illness. ==Aftermath== Lanao del Sur government officials visit the so-called \\"Ground Zero\\" or \\"Main Battle Area\\" in Marawi for the first time following the end of the conflict. Post-battle fighting and clearing operations After the end of military operations, the AFP killed a suspected surviving militant trying to escape on October 31, according to Col. Romeo Brawner. Muhammad Ilham Syaputra, an Indonesian militant who reportedly played a role in the 2016 Jakarta attacks, was caught near Marawi on November 1. He was caught while trying to escape from a district where several Maute fighters had been hiding, according to the police. Military officials stated on the next day that two militants engaged in a firefight with AFP and were killed during the night of November 1. Task Force Ranao deputy commander Romeo Brawner stated that Abu Talha, who was Hapilon's trusted aide for years, in addition to an unidentified militant, were killed while hiding in a building. In the aftermath of Marawi Battle, terrorist threats in the Philippine persist. Sporadic fighting continued following the declaration of victory, with troops battling some fighters hiding amid the ruins. The military stated on November 6 that nine more militants were killed in day-long clashes. Brawner stated that one of them was Ibrahim Maute alias Abu Jamil, a cousin of the Maute brothers. Philippine National Police chief Ronald dela Rosa meanwhile claimed that Amin Baco was still alive and had become the new emir. Military officials however said they believed Baco had been killed during the clashes on the same day or in recent weeks. Lt. Gen. Carlito Galvez said at a separate briefing that Baco and Abdullah, one of Hapilon's sons, could be among the nine who were killed. Two more militants were later killed, raising their death toll to 11, according to the military. On November 16, the AFP stated that they believed there were no more stragglers in Marawi, due to the lack of fighting between both sides for the past few weeks. Galvez confirmed in December 2017 the deaths of all the Maute brothers had been killed by AFP. He added that the military was continuing its manhunt for Abu Dar, a senior Maute leader. Dar was reported in January 2018 to have recruited new fighters from the cash and gold looted in Marawi. A year after the Battle of Marawi, threats of the Islamic State in the Philippines were still alive. Even three years after, terrorist threats in the Philippines emanating from the pro-ISIS groups continue unabated even during the COVID-19 pandemic. Infrastructure damage Map of the destruction left in the main battle area after the 5-month long battle in Marawi The battle left the city in ruins with 95 percent of the structures within the of the main battle area to be heavily damaged or completely collapsed. 3,152 buildings were completely destroyed and 2,145 buildings were partially to heavily damaged due to the five-month heavy bombardment during the war. Displacement of residents Government estimates placed the number of residents displaced during the crisis at 200,000. About 70 percent of displaced residents lived in nearby temporary government shelters as of May 2018. According to a United Nations estimate in December 2017, the number of indigenous Lumads that have been displaced is at 2,500. The Battle for Marawi took a heavy toll on infrastructure and private property in the city quarter where the battle was concentrated. At one point, over 200,000 of the civilian population evacuated to neighboring cities and towns such as Iligan, Cagayan de Oro, and Lanao Norte coastal towns at the start of hostilities. In April 2018, the government allowed some residents to visit their dwelling places for limited periods of time due to danger of unexploded ordnance still littering the battlefield (at the height of the fighting, government warplanes had to drop tons of bombs on rebel positions but many of them failed to detonate.) By May 2018, around 70 percent of Marawi's residents had returned home. According to the Philippines' Department of Social Welfare and Development, 64,364 displaced families have returned to the city as of July 2018. As of March 2019, around 70,000 people were still displaced.  Human rights concerns  An Amnesty International report released on November 16, 2017 blamed the militants and government forces of widespread abuses, some of which amount to war crimes. It was based on interviews with 48 survivors and witnesses, as well as local leaders, journalists and activists. It accused pro-ISIL fighters of extrajudicial killings and hostage-taking while accusing soldiers of mistreating people in custody. It also stated that government shelling caused widespread destruction in Marawi, civilians were trapped in crossfire and all parties engaged in looting. Per the report, the pro-ISIL fighters targeted and brutally killed Christians or anyone who couldn't recite Shahada (profession of Muslim faith). Victims of pro-ISIL fighters were either held hostage or killed. Amnesty International documented at least 25 extrajudicial killings at their hands. Hostages were tortured and abused, made to forage for food, collected and buried cadavers, dug foxholes for fighters, made IEDs, were forced to fight the Army or used as sex slaves. Those attempting to escape were shot or beheaded, Amnesty International said. Meanwhile, Amnesty International also reported that several survivors accused that they were shot at, beaten and tortured by Philippine Marines to make them confess of being an ISIL member, with one survivor stating he was doused with a hot liquid. Witnesses also said that 10 hostages were killed in air strikes by pro- government forces. It questioned whether civilian deaths and \\"large-scale destruction\\" in government air and ground attacks were \\"militarily necessary and proportional to the threat posed\\" by the fighters. It also questioned whether the operations met the requirements under international humanitarian law based on the fact that the military carried out bombings even after it declared only a few militants remained alive. AFP reiterated in November 2018 its commitment to protecting human rights in response to the report by Amnesty International. AFP spokesman Maj. Gen. Restituto Padilla said soldiers accused of abuses will be investigated and those found guilty will be disciplined. He gave filing of looting charges against an army officer and five soldiers as an example of the commitment. In response to claims of \\"disproportionate air and ground attacks\\" by AFP, he asked the public to take into consideration the difficulties faced by it. According to a Mindanao-based human rights group, there have been 130 reported cases of extrajudicial killings one year into the declaration of martial law in Mindanao, with most of the victims being peasants and indigenous Lumads. City restoration A year of rehabilitation and restoration was made official in 2018 by the national government, prompting cultural conservationists to point out that Maranao architectural styles and designs should be used in all reconstructions, rehabilitation, and restorations so that the indigenous Maranao aesthetics of the city won't be lost in the tide of development. On January 30, 2018, it was announced that a military camp will be established in the city, where the old city hall will be 'replaced' by a two-story building for military personnel, worrying conservationists of the possibility that the old heritage structures of Marawi will be demolished instead of being restored. Rehabilitation will cost PHP 75 billion (US$1.4 billion) and will be completed in 2021, according to Task Force Bangon Marawi. Many displaced residents remain in relocation sites on the outskirts of the city. ==Reactions== Domestic Government Duterte briefs the 4th Infantry Division at the troops' Headquarters-6 regarding the crisis. =National government= Following the clash, Duterte declared martial law in Mindanao at 10:00 in the evening (UTC+8) of May 23, 2017.

It was originally built for the Bonner Strassenbahn. It was bought for the construction of the MBS Nijmegen-Venlo line by C.P. Stuy (Nijmegen, Netherlands) in 1914. In 1915 the locomotive was thoroughly repaired in the VMH workshops (Helden, Netherlands) and rented to the ZVTM, who gave it #3. The locomotive was sold to the VMH in 1917. It was renumbered #5 by the VMH. Before entering into service in 1919, it was once again thoroughly repaired. When the VMH was absorbed into the LTM in 1923, the locomotive was renumbered #17. The cabin of the locomotive was later extended by the LTM to increase the very small room between the boiler and the front and rear walls of the cabin. The new front and rear of the locomotive were extended outside of the frame. At the same time, additional water storage was added between frame and axles. The name Venlo was added to the locomotive by the LTM at some point in time. This name plate was taken from VMH locomotive #1. The MBS purchased all former VMH lines and equipment of the LTM in 1929. This locomotive retained #17 at that time. It was taken out of service in 1935, and sold for scrap in 1937. ==References== Category:Steam locomotives of the Netherlands Category:Steam locomotives of Germany Category:Hohenzollern locomotives ","title":"Bonner Strassenbahn ROSWINDIS"},{"id":"54118371","text":"The reactions to the Manchester Arena bombing, which occurred on 22 May 2017, include the responses by political and religious leaders, media and the general public, both within the United Kingdom, where the Manchester Arena bombing took place, and from other nations and international organizations. Numerous notable establishments around the world also held memorials. Ariana Grande, who had been giving a concert at the Manchester Arena shortly before the attack, issued a statement thereafter via Twitter that she was \\"broken,\\" and offered to help those affected by the bombing. The general public sympathised with Grande's words and showed their overwhelming support as her statement later became the second most liked tweet of all time. In addition to returning to the city to visit and FaceTime hospitalised victims, Grande subsequently organised a benefit concert, One Love Manchester, headlined by herself and a number of other artists and groups. The concert was watched by more than 100 million people worldwide and raised proceeds exceeding £10 million in the twelve hours following its conclusion. In the United Kingdom, Prime Minister Theresa May chaired an emergency meeting of the COBRA committee in the hours following the 22 May 2017 bombing, and the UK's threat level was raised from \\"severe\\" to \\"critical\\" for a number of days, the first time it had stood at \\"critical\\" since 2007. May also condemned the attack, along with Mayor of Greater Manchester Andy Burnham and other leading politicians and public figures. Religious groups, including the Muslim Council of Britain, also voiced their condemnation. Internationally the attack was universally condemned by world leaders. The Islamic State of Iraq and Syria issued a statement in support of the act. Monuments in locations around the world were lit up in the colours of the Union Jack in solidarity with the UK, and silences were held to remember the victims of the bombing. A number of organisations and individuals offered tributes to the victims, including the broadcaster ITV, whose soap Coronation Street is filmed in Manchester; numerous figures from the music and entertainment industries also expressed their sympathy. ==Background== The Arena where the attack took place The attack occurred on 22 May 2017, at around 22:30 BST (UTC+01:00), when a suicide bomber detonated an improvised explosive device in the foyer area of the Manchester Arena. The attack took place after a concert given by the US singer Ariana Grande that was part of her 2017 Dangerous Woman Tour. The concert was sold out, and up to 21,000 people were in attendance. Many of the concertgoers were children and young people, who make up much of Grande's fanbase. Greater Manchester Police subsequently confirmed that 22 people had been killed and 120 injured, 59 of whom received hospital treatment; a number of children were confirmed to be among the fatalities. The attacker was also identified as Salman Abedi, a 22-year-old male, and British citizen of Libyan descent. ==Domestic responses== St Ann's Square On 23 May 2017, Queen Elizabeth II and the British royal family held a minute of silence at a Buckingham Palace garden party in honour of the victims of the bombing. Following a minute of silence in St Anne's Square, a cry of \\"Rock on, Manchester\\" elicited applause and a spontaneous rendition of Oasis's \\"Don't Look Back in Anger\\" by the crowd. Prime Minister Theresa May called the incident an \\"appalling terrorist attack\\" and chaired a meeting of COBRA the next morning, while Queen Elizabeth II expressed her \\"deepest sympathy\\" to those affected by this \\"dreadful event\\". Visiting the Royal Manchester Children's Hospital, the Queen said \\"It's dreadful, very wicked to target that sort of thing.\\" Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn called it a \\"terrible incident\\", stating that his \\"thoughts are with all those affected and our brilliant emergency services\\". Campaigning for the general election was suspended by all political parties, and largely remained on hold until 26 May. The day after the bombing, May announced that the UK's threat level had been raised to 'critical' for the first time in 10 years. As a result, the British Armed Forces would be deployed to support police forces at key locations in the UK. The threat level remained at critical for four days before being reduced back to severe on 27 May. The Mayor of Greater Manchester, Andy Burnham, called the incident \\"an evil act\\". Burnham paid tribute to locals and businesses who had supported the victims. He later announced a vigil to be held in Albert Square the following evening. The morning after the attack, London's mayor Sadiq Khan stated that the capital \\"stands united with the great city of Manchester today\\", and later stated that \\"Londoners will see more police on our streets today\\". Prince William visited Manchester on 2 June, where he met police officers, paramedics, and others who assisted in the aftermath of the explosion. He also visited the Royal Manchester Children's Hospital and spoke to children still being treated for injuries sustained in the blast. Grande also visited the hospital later the same day, and spent time with children and members of staff. Police reported a 505% increase in anti- Muslim hate crimes in the Greater Manchester area in the month following the bombing. Tommy Robinson, the former leader of the English Defence League organised a rally at Manchester's Piccadilly Gardens on 11 June, which was attended by several hundred people. The demonstration was held under the banner of UK Against Hate and prompted a counter demonstration by anti-fascist protesters, at which attendance was also in the hundreds. Demonstrators clashed with police, while media reported that one man had carried a pig's head. The rally drew criticism from Burnham, who tweeted \\"These EDL-types who came today need to have a look at themselves [...] @gmpolice deserve better.\\" ==International response== International bodies * African Union: Chairperson Moussa Faki of the African Union Commission, \\"strongly condemned\\" the \\"senseless act of violence and loss of life in Manchester\\" and stated that \\"Africa stands with the people and government of the United Kingdom in reaffirming our solidarity with them during this difficult time\\". * border Anglican Communion: Justin Welby, Archbishop of Canterbury, said \\"Heroic Manchester, dark evil cannot overcome it.

Public figures Columnist Katie Hopkins suggested the need for a \\"final solution\\", which was interpreted by some as calling for ethnic cleansing of the UK's Muslim population. However she then deleted her tweet and replaced the words \\"final solution\\" with \\"true solution\\". LBC, a London-based talk radio station on which Hopkins had hosted a Sunday morning programme since April 2016, subsequently announced that she would be leaving their presenting lineup immediately. Comedian Rufus Hound wrote several tweets accusing the Conservative Party of committing the attack for electoral gains, comparing it to the Reichstag fire of 1933. He subsequently retracted the conspiracy theory following criticism from other Twitter users. James Corden made a statement on his talk show, The Late Late Show with James Corden, expressing that people will \\"go to bed holding our little ones tighter\\" after the attacks. Fellow talk show host Ellen DeGeneres wrote on Twitter: \\"This story is so sad and so scary. Sending all my love to Manchester.\\" Former Presidents of the United States Barack Obama and Bill Clinton wrote: \\"Americans will always stand shoulder to shoulder with the people of the UK\\" and \\"senseless & vicious acts of terror never drive us apart,\\" respectively.

Music industry Many within the music industry showed their support for Grande and the victims of the attack. Vevo posted a five-second ad on YouTube, stating their sympathies with those affected in Manchester. American singer- songwriter Katy Perry condemned the bombing, stating she was \\"broken hearted\\" for everyone involved, and for \\"the state of this world\\". Canadian hip-hop artist Drake offered condolences to the victims of the bombing, adding that it was a \\"real fear\\" that he had while on his recent concert tour. American rapper Nicki Minaj, who has previously collaborated with Grande, said that her \\"heart hurts\\" after hearing about the attack.

Eminem and Justin Timberlake helped raise over $2 million for the victims. Liam Gallagher announced a solo gig at Manchester's O2 Ritz, the proceeds of which would be donated to a fund established by the families of the victims. Some artists, such as Blondie, Kiss, and Take That, cancelled upcoming gigs to show respect for the victims. Other artists chose to go ahead with planned concerts as a sign of defiance against terrorism. On 27 May, Manchester indie group The Courteeners played a gig at Old Trafford cricket ground that was attended by a crowd of 50,000, and included supporting sets from The Charlatans, Blossoms and Cabbage, all of them Manchester groups. The venue was guarded by armed police. Joy Division and New Order bassist, Peter Hook and his daughter, Jessica; were interviewed on BBC Radio 4's Today programme.

Noel Gallagher donated proceeds from the sale of \\"Don't Look Back in Anger\\" to the We Love Manchester appeal after the song became an unofficial anthem of support for Manchester in the aftermath of the attacks. On 9 July 2017, a performance to benefit the Manchester bombing victims was held in New York City's The Cutting Room, called \\"Break Free: United for Manchester\\", with Broadway theatre and television performers interpreting Ariana Grande songs.

British Muslim groups, such as the Muslim Council of Britain and Ahmadi Muslims UK condemned the attack and expressed their condolences. General Secretary of the Bible Society Egypt Ramez Attallah said \\"I was shocked this morning when I saw the scenes of the bloodshed. It remained me so much of when we had similar attacks in Egypt, this last year. My condolences to the families, to the orphans, to the parents that lost their children. And to the churches, as they try to comfort them. May God have mercy.\\" Secretary General Stefan Gustavsson of the Swedish Evangelical Alliance stated \\"It is with shock, sadness and anger, that we have received the news about the terror attack in Manchester. It is an attack, not only on the many individuals who were so tragically affected, but also on the civilization we are a part of.\\" Sporting organisations ICC The International Cricket Council (ICC) suggested that the 2017 ICC Champions Trophy, starting in June, could be in doubt after the bombing as a result of security issues. Tournament Director Steve Elworthy added that \\"our thoughts and condolences are with everyone who has been affected by this appalling atrocity. The security plan and planning process has been developed in line with, and reflects, the current threat level within the UK. We will be assessing and reviewing that security plan all the time. We've continually worked with the venues to help develop our plan. The readiness testing has been completed, so we are up to speed with all of that. The ICC, through David Richardson [CEO] and ourselves have been in contact with all of the members and are in continual communication with them over the last 12 hours, and will continue to be in contact until the tournament kicks off.\\" UEFA UEFA, in charge of the 2017 UEFA Europa League Final in Sweden between local club Manchester United and AFC Ajax, released a statement expressing \\"our thoughts are with the victims and families of those affected\\". They urged fans to arrive at the Friends Arena in Solna as early as possible due to tight security arrangements. These arrangements were already in place and scheduled since the truck attack in Stockholm earlier in the year. The opening ceremony was considerably reduced as a mark of respect for the victims and a minute's silence will be observed prior to the final. Manchester United players also wore black armbands for the victims of the bombing. After winning the match over Ajax, Manchester United dedicated the win to the city of Manchester, with several players stating \\"This is for you Manchester\\" in the wake of the attack. Manchester United stated: \\"Our thoughts and prayers go out to all those affected, including our supporters, club staff and members of our community such as the children from our Manchester United Foundation partner schools who were attending the concert at the Arena.\\" AFC Ajax stated: \\"From Amsterdam with love to Manchester. Our thoughts are with the victims and the loved ones of those affected.\\" UEFA President Aleksander Čeferin said: \\"I am deeply saddened by the horrible terrorist attack in Manchester last night. It shocks me that so many innocent people lost their lives and I would like to send my condolences to the families of those affected.\\" The band of the French Republican Guard covered Oasis' 1996 chart-topping hit \\"Don't Look Back in Anger\\" before a minute's silence was held, honouring both the victims of the Manchester attack and the subsequent London bridge attack on 3 June, prior to England's friendly against France in Paris on 13 June. Manchester Tattoo Appeal \\"Love not hate\\" chalk graffiti on the pavement in St Ann's Square, featuring the worker bee symbol. The worker bee has been a symbol of Manchester since the Industrial Revolution, when it was adopted in the city's coat of arms to represent industriousness, and bee motifs have been used to decorate various architectural features and street furniture in the city. In the aftermath of the bombing, the bee began to gain in popularity as a symbol of public unity against terrorism, appearing on protest banners and graffiti. A campaign was launched by a tattoo artist in Stalybridge to offer tattoos of the worker bee symbol for a £50 donation to support victims of the bombing. The Manchester Tattoo Appeal rapidly gained in popularity and spread to other tattoo parlours in Manchester and elsewhere. Grande was among those to have a bee tattoo, posting an image of it on her social media shortly after the first anniversary of the attack, along with the word \\"forever\\". Reopening of Manchester Arena On 16 August 2017, it was announced that Manchester Arena would reopen on 9 September, with a benefit concert featuring Noel Gallagher and other acts associated with the North West.

It was released in 2002 by Voiceprint Records, and is the musician's most experimental, ambitious and elaborate output. Heavily influenced by the sonority of Syd Barrett, Stereolab and of the Canterbury scene (in particular Kevin Ayers and his 1970 release Shooting at the Moon),Voiceprint Records - Jupiter Apple - Hisscivilization Hisscivilization is characterized by the inclusion of electronic interludes, absent in Jupiter Apple's previous two releases,Mofo - Jupiter Apple - Hisscivilization in a move that polarized critics and fans alike. It is also fully sung in English, like its predecessor Plastic Soda. \\"Exactly\\" was re-recorded for his subsequent collaborative album with Bibmo, Bitter. ==Critical reception== The album was well-received upon its release, but many critics did not gravitate towards its heavily experimental sonority and long length. Writing for AllMusic, François Couture gave it 3 out of 5 stars, saying it is \\"filled with catchy hooks, intriguing twists and self-indulgent stretches\\", and comparing Jupiter Apple with Cornelius and Beck. However, he also said that \\"the album's only flaw is its duration – problem is, it's a big one. Not only does Hisscivilization clock in at 78 minutes, but most of its 13 tracks could have been substantially shortened\\".

They entered service in 1912, named VENLO, PANNINGEN, HELDEN, and MAASBREE. A condenser with four pipes of diameter 152 mm and a length of 3150 mm was part of the locomotive equipment. It was removed at a later date. At the absorption of the VMH into the Limburgsche Tramweg Maatschappij (LTM) in 1923 the locomotives were numbered 13-16. The MBS purchased all former VMH lines and equipment of the LTM in 1929. These locomotive retained their numbers at that time. The name plate of VMH 1 VENLO was placed on VMH 5 (LTM 17). In 1935 the passenger service on the line Venlo-Beringen was terminated and the locomotives were taken out of service. Locomotives 13, 15 and 16 were sold for scrap in 1937. Locomotive 14 remained, without axles, wheels, and driving rods in the workshops of the MBS in Gennep. It was used as heating boiler. Although during the war between 1940-1945 there were plans to restore the locomotive to full service, these were not executed.

F. Sturtevant Company was a Boston-based manufacturer of fans. It became a leader in the manufacture of industrial air cooling and ventilation systems. ==Origins== A Sturtevant Company ventilation system installed at a Montreal lumber planing mill, ca. 1920 The company was founded in 1860 in Boston by inventor Benjamin Franklin Sturtevant (born 1833 in Norridgewock, Mainedied 1890 in Boston); the plant was located near the present Government Center area. The company at first manufactured wooden pegs used in shoemaking. The process created much sawdust, and Sturtevant invented a mechanical fan that was effective at keeping the work area sawdust-free. By 1864 Sturtevant was manufacturing the first commercially successful blower, and by 1866 the company employed 50 workers and worked exclusively on making fans. In 1869 the company introduced the \\"Sturtevant system,\\" still the basis for much interior heating of buildings. Sturtevant adapted hot blast technology for indoor heating, using ductwork to spread the warmed air. In 1876 the company moved its plant to the Jamaica Plain neighborhood of Boston, and soon began work with the United States Navy. In 1879, Sturtevant introduced a system for ventilating the hulls of ships. In 1879, Sturtevant supplied the USS Alliance with mechanical draft fans that improved fuel efficiency so much that Navy ships were able to retire their back-up sail systems. ==20th century growth== Sturtevant died in 1890 and his son-in-law, Eugene Foss, took over the business. After a 1901 fire, the plant was moved to Hyde Park in 1903, into a new ten-building, facility designed by Lockwood, Greene & Co. It was now the world's largest manufacturer of electrical fans. The company had expanded into industrial ventilation, heating, air conditioning, dust and fume removal, power, drying and vacuum cleaning. In 1906, Sturtevant installed the first industrial air conditioning system at Walter Baker & Company in Dorchester, and, at a Chicago hotel in 1910, the first residential air conditioning system. They opened a factory in Galt, Ontario in 1913. Foss left the company in 1909 to run for Governor of Massachusetts, for which he served three one- year terms. By 1917, Foss's personal money problems threatened the company, which was put into receivership with the rest of his assets. The company survived and, flush with World War I contracts, flourished. In 1919 Sturtevant opened a factory in Framingham, followed by one in Camden, New Jersey in 1922, and Berkeley, California in 1923. Sturtevant, Wisconsin was named for the factory works opened there in 1923. Sturtevant introduced its highly efficient backward-curved Silentvane fans in 1922, which would be used in the ventilation of the Holland Tunnel. Its Inlet Vane Control system, introduced in 1927, adjusted to load requirements, allowing simpler motors and reducing power consumption. In World War II, almost every new United States fighting ship was built with Sturtevant ventilation. ==Post-war decline== In 1945, near the end of the war, Sturtevant was taken over by Westinghouse. The new owners reconstructed and modernized the Hyde Park facilities in 1946, but in 1954 Westinghouse moved the air conditioning business to Virginia, and Sturtevant Boston returned to its roots as an industrial fan manufacturer. In 1985 Sturtevant was sold to the South Africa-based American-Davidson, who quickly sold the industrial fan line to Oklahoma-based Acme Engineering & Manufacturing. The international boycotts of South Africa affected American- Davidson, which closed what was left of Sturtevant in 1989. ==ReferencesExternal links== *Air Duct & Filter Cleaning Category:Heating, ventilation, and air conditioning companies Category:Manufacturing companies established in 1860 Category:1860 establishments in Massachusetts Category:Manufacturing companies disestablished in 1989 Category:1989 disestablishments in Massachusetts Category:1945 mergers and acquisitions Category:Westinghouse Electric Company Category:1985 mergers and acquisitions ","title":"B.

It is associated with a crustal lineament known as the Ojo de Agua Lineament. It is located in the Sierras de Cordoba mountain chain. It formed during the late Miocene, when a progressive shallowing of the subducting Nazca Plate caused volcanic activity to retreat from the main Andes into the land behind the mountain chain. This did result in a typical shallow slab chemistry of the Pocho rocks. Volcanic activity at Pocho is dated about 4.7 +- 0.3 million years ago and took place over two cycles. Seismic activity in the area may indicate the presence of a residual magma chamber however, which would also explain anomalous crustal seismic velocities in the area. == References  External links == * Category:Volcanoes of Argentina Category:Miocene volcanism ","title":"Pocho volcanic field"},{"id":"54118587","text":"To Rithya (born 10 October 1967) is a Cambodian long-distance runner.

It is the oldest existing collection of Chan (or Zen) encounter dialogues, dating from about half a century before the much more well known Transmission of the Lamp. After being lost for centuries, it was rediscovered by Japanese scholars in the 20th century at the Haeinsa temple in Korea, in a complete form with all twenty chapters. The text survived in the form of printing plates made during the 13th century, and not as a printed book. Much like other Chan Buddhist texts, it is written in the form of daily conversations between masters and students or between students themselves. The Anthology is particularly important for the study of the history of Chinese, as it contains what is believed to be a good record of what vernacular northern Chinese speech was like in the 10th century. An example of a grammatical phenomenon in the text is the use of 也 yě as a marker of the perfect, showing a coalescence of the Classical Chinese particles 也 yě and 矣 yǐ. :僧問居此多少年也。 :sēng wèn jū cǐ duōshǎo nián yě :monk ask live PROX more-less year PRF :'The monk asked how many years you've lived here.'

Guinness World Records has different accredited results on the matter, showing the Carolina Reaper as the hottest in the world. ==Development== The plant was developed in a collaboration between chili farmer Neal Price, NPK Technology, and Nottingham Trent University during a test of a special plant food and for its essential oil having potential as a skin anesthetic. The Dragon's Breath plant was later cultivated by breeder Mike Smith of St. Asaph, Denbighshire, Wales, who said that he had not planned to breed the chili for record heat, but rather was trying to grow an attractive pepper plant. Due to the nationality of the farmer who cultivated the pepper in Wales, it was named Dragon's Breath after the Welsh dragon. It was entered in the Plant of the Year contest at the 2017 Chelsea Flower Show where it was on the short list, but did not place. ==Heat== The Dragon's Breath chili was tested at 2.48 million Scoville units, exceeding the 1.5 million of the Carolina Reaper, the hottest previously known chili, but was surpassed several months later by Pepper X at 3.18 million Scoville units. Nottingham Trent University researchers suggest that the pepper's ability to numb the skin might make its essential oil useful as an anaesthetic for patients who cannot tolerate other anaesthetics, or in countries where they are too expensive. Experts at the university warned that swallowing one might cause death by choking or anaphylactic shock; one science writer noted that this was a standard warning that applied only to those with relevant allergies. ==See also== * List of Capsicum cultivars * Race to grow the hottest pepper ==References== Category:Chili peppers Category:Capsicum cultivars Category:Crops originating from Europe ","title":"Dragon's Breath (chili pepper)"},{"id":"54118634","text":"William K.

The Central Swedish lowland () is a large region of low relief and altitude in Sweden spanning from the Swedish West Coast at Bohuslän to Stockholm archipelago and Roslagen at the Baltic Sea. The Central Swedish lowland forms a broad east-west trending belt north of the South Swedish highlands and south of the Norrland terrain.Natenc Traditionally the heartland of Sweden due to its large population and agricultural resources the region benefits additionally from the proximity of hydropower, forest and mineral resources. The lowland is also at a good position for trade with the Baltic region. These advantages are reflected in the location of Sweden's capital, Stockholm, at the eastern end of the lowlands. Most of Sweden's manufacturing industries lies in this region. ==Relief, soil and vegetation== Joint valley landscape seen in wintertime Stockholm archipelago. The reason on how the lowlands reached its sunken position relative to other parts of Sweden is not clear. Possibly its boundaries are flexures in Earth's crust rather, the possibility of geological faults forming its boundaries is ruled out as none of them have been found.. Much of the Sub-Cambrian peneplain, that is otherways common in eastern Sweden, is preserved on the Central Swedish lowland. The relief of the region is contain various areas of joint valley terrain (), this means that the landscape is dissected by valleys following joints, faults and other weakness zones in the Precambrian shield rocks. NNW- SSE trending eskers, that are usually forested, crosses the lowlands. In Västergötland the lowland contain a series of hills made up Silurian-aged sedimentary rock, these are; Kinnekulle, Halleberg, Hunneberg and Billingen. The region forms a belt of fertile soils suitable for agriculture that interrupts the forested and till-coated lands to the north and south. The soil types of the Central Swedish lowland include fine grained sediments, like clays, as patent materials. This is because the whole region is below the highest coastline () since deglaciation, allowing for marine and lacustrine sedimentation before post-glacial rebound bought the lowland above sea level. Before the expansion of agriculture fertile soils were occupied by contiguous broad-leaved tree forest where maples, oaks, ashes, small-leaved lime and common hazel grew. The Central Swedish lowland does however also contain soils of poor quality, particularly in hills where Scots pine and Norway spruce grows on top of thin till soils. ==Hydrography== Sweden's four largest lakes, Vänern, Vättern, Mälaren and Hjälmaren, all lie within the lowlands. The Central Swedish lowland is one of Sweden's ten groundwater regions. The groundwater of the coast of the Central Swedish lowlands have high amounts of chloride as result of the presence of fossil sea water. The soils developed on fine-grained sediments are better buffers against groundwater acidification than tills found elsewhere in Sweden. ==See also== *Central Swedish ice-edge zone ==NotesReferences== Category:Depressions of Europe Category:Götaland Category:Svealand Category:Plains of Sweden ","title":"Central Swedish lowland"},{"id":"54118645","text":"Ajay Chuttoo (born 13 November 1965) is a Mauritian long-distance runner.

In contradiction to what intuition would suggest (namely that increased rivalry encourages better performance), Brown finds that the presence of a superstar is in fact associated with reduced competitor’s efforts in rank-order tournaments. The explanation she provides is an economic model in which competing is costly - one might hurt themselves, for instance - thus when the chance of winning is very low, the participant is discouraged from performing to her best abilities as it is not worthwhile. The study uses data from the Professional Golfers' Association (PGA) that contains round-by-round scores for all players in every tournament from 1999 to 2006 and hole-by-hole results for all events from 2002 to 2006. During this period, golfer Tiger Woods was performing significantly better than any other player with scores in regular and major events being lower than the group mean in all years except 2004. His consistent and dominant performance has earned him the title of superstar. Hence, the data is filtered creating a subset of tournaments Tiger Woods was a part of and other players’ performance is compared to when they are competing against Woods to when they are not. The analysis yields that on events when the highly skilled golfers were competing against Tiger Woods, their performance was considerably worse - with scores almost one stroke higher on average - than on events where Tiger Woods was absent. On the other hand, lower-ranked golfers are less or not at all affected by his presence. Brown notes that this could be due to the fact that the stakes are not as high for lower-ranked golfers to start with. Brown investigates the possibility of other explanations as to why golfers’ performance is poorer but finds that it is neither due to players taking more risks nor is the other players’ performance worse relative to Woods’ due to the fact that better golfers avoid competitions the superstar would be their opponent in. She also disperses the idea that it would be the increased media attention attributed to Woods’ presence that causes other players to produce lower results. Finally, Brown notes that superstars must in fact be in their ‘super’ stage of career to be able to create an adverse effect: in periods where Tiger Woods was not that successful (in years 2003-2004) golfers actually seem to have played better against him. == Further research == Three years after Brown’s study, in 2010, a similar one was conducted in Japan by Ryuichi Tanaka and Kazutoshi Ishino. The writers look at how the presence of Japan golfer superstar Kazuo Ozaki affects the game of others and their findings are in accordance with those of the paper on Woods. Their results suggest that when having to compete against Ozaki, players perform worse by about 0.3 strokes on average. Yet another research, published by Brian C. Hill in 2014, examines the same effect in 100-meter tournaments with Usain Bolt being the superstar on the field. Surprisingly, Hill finds a positive superstar effect, meaning that runners produce faster running times and the likelihood of setting a personal record is increased. Wanting to explain the results seemingly contradictory to that of Brown’s, Hill points out the simultaneous nature of running competitions (whereas in golf, players get to watch each other) and that a 100-meter race is about 10 seconds which does not leave competitors much time to alter their behaviour because of Bolt. == Relevance in management == The importance of studying the dynamics of rank- order tournaments with heterogeneous competitors reaches beyond the world of sports. Numerous management strategies use competition as an incentive for better productivity, however, according to the superstar effect, if agents are to rival a superstar, they may in fact reduce their efforts. == References == Category:Sports terminology Category:Social psychology Category:Sports psychology Category:Golf in the United States ","title":"The Superstar Effect"},{"id":"54118844","text":"Marcelo Barrientos (born 9 May 1970) is a Chilean long-distance runner.

This representative building of a reputable banker, merchant and president of the Managing Board of the Belgrade Cooperative in Belgrade Charshia had the qualities of Art Nouveau architecture, with a strong seal of аcademic аrchitecture. The entrance hall was painted by the famous decorative painter Dragutin Inkiostri. Two floors were added in 1926–1927, designed by the architect Samuel Sumbula which did not significantly change the original appearance of the building. The character of the building stems from the fact that it represents the work of one of the most famous architects of Belgrade and testifies about the personality of the investor that left a legacy of valuable architectural objects to Belgrade.

A relative hour has no fixed radical, but changes with the length of each day - depending on summer (when the days are long and the nights are short), and in winter (when the days are short and the nights are long). Even so, in all seasons a day is always divided into 12 hours, and a night is always divided into 12 hours, which inevitably makes for a longer hour or a shorter hour.R. Moses b. Maimon Responsa, ed.

Midnight (12:00am) was also the sixth hour of the night, whereas the first hour of the night began when the first three stars appeared in the night sky. ==Jewish tradition== In old times, the hour was detected by observation of the position of the sun,Sefer Ravid ha-Zahav of Rabbi David Mishreqi (Mizrachi), ed. Shimon Giat, Betar-Ilit 2002, Responsa Ravid Ha-Zahav, responsum # 13, s.v. ונהירנא (p. 182) or when the first three stars appeared in the night sky. During the first six hours of the day, the sun is seen in the eastern sky. At the sixth hour, the sun is always at its zenith in the sky, meaning, it is either directly overhead, or parallel (depending on the hemisphere).Babylonian Talmud, Pesahim 12b; 11b Those persons living in the Northern Hemisphere, the sun at noon time will appear overhead slightly towards the south, whereas for those living in the Southern Hemisphere, the sun at noon time will appear overhead slightly towards the north. From the 6th and a half hour to the 12th hour, the sun inclines towards the west, until it sets. The conclusion of a day at the end of twilight may slightly vary in minutes from place to place, depending on the elevation and the terrain.Israel Meir Kagan, Mishnah Berura on Shulhan Arukh (Orah Hayyim 261:2:23), otherwise known as the time it takes to walk \\"three quarters of a biblical mile.\\" Typically, nightfall ushers in more quickly in the low-lying valleys, than it does on a high mountaintop.In the Babylonian Talmud (Shabbat 118b) we read: Rabbi Jose has said: “Let my portion be with those who usher in the Sabbath day [at its outset] in Tiberias, and with those who dismiss the Sabbath day [at its recess] in Sepphoris.” This has been explained by Aaron Mordechai Freedman (editor of the 1987 Soncino edition of Tractate Shabbath): \\"In Tiberias, which was situated in a valley, the Sabbath commenced rather earlier, whilst in Sepphoris, which was on a mountain, it terminated rather later than elsewhere.\\" (v. Hebrew- English Edition of the Babylonian Talmud, Tractate Shabbath, Soncino edition, London 1987, s.v. Shabbath 118b, note (b)3). Freedman's description of twilight being, literally, an oscillating physical reality dependent upon one's location is supported by Rabbi Joseph ibn Migash (1077–1141) [Responsa of R. Joseph ibn Migash, responsum # 45] and by Rabbi David ben Zimra (c. 1479–1573) [Responsa of Rabbi David ben Zimra, book I, responsum # 76], as also by Rabbi Hayyim Eliezer, the son of Isaac ben Moses of Vienna (13th century), who also compiled a book called \\"Or Zarua\\" (responsum # 186). Apparently, there is a local phenomenon relating to light emanating from fixed stars in the sky, and their becoming visible once a certain level of darkness has enveloped the land. Rashi, however, differs in view, whose opinion is supported also by Rabbi Menachem Meiri (1249–1306) Langa's Edition, p. 460, and Rabbi Nissim ben Jacob (990–1062), and who all thought that twilight was a fixed time for all, but that the people of Tiberias and Sepphoris were merely stringent in their religious practices, the one group welcoming the Sabbath early, while the other departing from it as late as possible. The conventional Jewish way of calibrating the time of day is to reckon the \\"first hour\\" of the day with the rise of dawn (), that is to say, approximately 72 minutes before sunrise,Mishnah - with a Commentary of Rabbi Moses ben Maimon (ed. Yosef Qafih), vol. 1, Mossad Harav Kook: Jerusalem 1963, s.v. Berakhot 1:5 (p. 33); Megillah 2:4 (p. 232) and the end of the day commencing shortly after sunset when the first three medium-size stars have appeared in the night sky.Responsa of Rabbi David ben Zimra, Book 4, Warsaw 1882 (reprinted), s.v. responsum # 1353 (282) From the moment of sunset when the sun is no longer visible until the appearance of the first three medium- size stars is a unit of time called evening twilight (). In the Talmud, twilight is estimated at being the time that it takes a person to walk three quarters of a biblical mile (i.e. 1,500 cubits, insofar that a biblical mile is equal to 2,000 cubits).Babylonian Talmud, Shabbat 34b-35a; Chaim Yosef David Azulai, Birkei Yosef (Orah Hayyim, § 261:1), Levorno 1774, citing the author of Ginat Weradim, who wrote: \\"The world has it as a practice in all the Diaspora communities of Israel [to follow the opinion of] the Geonim\\" (i.e. with respect to the time of bayn ha-shemashot (twilight; nightfall), so that immediately following sunset begins the time known as bayn ha-shemashot, which is the time it takes to walk three quarters of a biblical mile). The opinion of Rabbi Chaim Azulai comes to counter a variant opinion that is also found in the Talmud (Pesahim 94a), where it states that a man is able to walk four mil between sunset and nightfall, an opinion rejected by most exponents of Jewish law. According to Maran's Shulhan Arukh, a man traverses a biblical mile in 18 minutes,Yosef Karo, Shulhan Arukh (Orah Hayyim § 459:2) meaning, one is able to walk three quarters of a mile in 13½ minutes. According to Maimonides, a man walks a biblical mile in 24 minutes, meaning, three quarters of a mile is done in 18 minutes. In Jewish law, the short period of dusk or twilight (from the moment the sun has disappeared over the horizon until the appearance of the first three stars) is a space of time whose designation is doubtful, partly considered day and partly considered night. When the first medium-size star appears in the night sky, it is still considered day; when the second star appears, it is an ambiguous case. When the third star appears, it is the beginning of the first hour of the night. Between the break of dawn and the first three medium-size stars that appear in the night sky there are always 12 hours. In the Modern Age of astral science and of precise astronomical calculations, it is now possible to determine the length of the ever-changing hour by simple mathematics. To determine the length of each relative hour, one needs but simply know two variables: (a) the precise time of sunrise, and (b) the precise time of sunset. Since the actual day begins approximately 72 minutes before sunrise, and ends 13½ minutes after the sun has already set and can no longer be seen over the horizon (according to Maran),Shulhan Arukh (Orah Hayyim § 261:2) or 18 minutes (according to Maimonides), by collecting the total number of minutes in any given day and dividing the total number of minutes by 12, the quotient that one is left with is the number of minutes to each hour. In summer months, when the days are long, the length of each hour during daytime can be as much as 77 minutes or more, whereas the length of each hour during nighttime can be less than 42 minutes. ==Practical bearing== In Jewish Halacha, the practical bearing of this teaching is reflected in many halachic practices. For example, whenever observant Jews refer to the appointed time for reciting the verses of Kriyat Shema, ideally, this recital must be made from the time of sunrise until the end of the third hour of the day, a time that actually fluctuates on the standard 12-hour clock, depending on summer and winter.Mishnah - with a Commentary of Rabbi Moses ben Maimon (ed. Yosef Qafih), vol. 1, Mossad Harav Kook: Jerusalem 1963, s.v. Berakhot 1:5 (p. 33) Its application is also used in determining the time of the Morning Prayer, traditionally said, as a first resort, from sunrise until the end of the fourth hour,Yosef Karo, Shulhan Arukh (Orah Hayyim § 89:1) but as a last resort can be said until noon time,Mishnah, Berakhot 4:1 (Maimonides, Mishne Torah, Hil. Tefillah 3:1) and which times will vary if one were to rely solely on the dials of the standard 12-hour clock, depending on the Summer months and Winter months. On the eve of Passover, Jews are only permitted to eat chametz until the fourth-hour of the day.Mishnah (Pesahim 1:4) In Jewish tradition, prayers were usually offered at the time of the daily whole-burnt offerings.Rabbeinu Hananel's Commentary on Tractate Berakhot (ed. David Metzger),Jerusalem 1990, s.v. Berakhot 26a (p. 51) The historian, Josephus, writing about the daily whole-burnt offering, says that it was offered twice each day, in the morning and about the ninth hour.Josephus, Antiquities (xiv.iv.§ 3) The Mishnah, a compendium of Jewish oral laws compiled in the late 2nd-century CE, says of the morning daily offering that it was offered in the fourth hour,Mishnah, Eduyot 6:1 but says of the late afternoon offering: \\"The daily whole-burnt offering was slaughtered at a half after the eighth hour, and offered up at a half after the ninth hour.\\"The Mishnah (ed. Herbert Danby), Oxford University Press: Oxford 1977, s.v. Pesahim 5:1, p. 141 Elsewhere, when describing the slaughter of the Passover offerings on the eve of Passover (the 14th day of the lunar month Nisan), Josephus writes: \\"...their feast which is called the Passover, when they slay their sacrifices, from the ninth hour to the eleventh, etc.\\" (roughly corresponding to 3 o'clock pm to 5 o'clock pm).Josephus, Wars (vi.ix.§ 3) Conversely, the Mishnah states that on the eve of Passover the daily whole- burnt offering was slaughtered at a half past the seventh hour, and offered up at a half past the eighth hour. ==See also== * Zmanim * Lunar calendar * Hebrew calendar * Biblical and Talmudic units of measurement * Roman timekeeping * Chinese Traditional Time System ==References== Category:Timekeeping Category:Time measurement systems Category:Jewish law Category:Time in astronomy Category:Units of time Category:Time in religion Category:Jewish law and rituals ","title":"Relative hour"},{"id":"54119229","text":"Victoire Conen de Saint-Luc self-portrait Victoire Conen de Saint-Luc (January 27, 1761 – 1794) was a French noble and nun.

Practicing devotion to the Sacred Heart, she had painted pictures and insignia like those worn by many Vendée insurgents, and which she had also given to a sympathizer of the rebellion. This incriminated her as a rebel sympathizer, and she was suspected for knowingly having contact with the rebels and for being a supporter of the uprising.

Reviews by the Archdiocese of Paris took place in 1920 and 1921 and in 1925 documents were sent to the Sacred Congregation of Rites (now Congregation for the Causes of Saints). However, the death of the postulator then caused the interruption of the cause. Victoire Conen de Saint-Luc was considered a martyr executed for religious reasons by counter revolutionaries, and the new retreat, which was re-founded after the revolution, was dedicated to her. She was depicted in several churches in Brittany, and in 1923 a school, the \\"Victoire Conen de Saint-Luc\\", was named after her.

Bishop Toussaint Conen of Saint-Luc is also kneeling, with Saint John the Evangelist standing behind him. * In the north transept of the Saint-Mathieu church in Quimper , Victoire de Saint-Luc also appears in the large stained glass window entitled \\"Apparition of the Sacred Heart\\" (Ateliers Champigneulle, Paris, 1896 ), in the company of many saints, among whom we recognize St. John Eudes , Margaret-Marie Alacoque, St. John the Evangelist, St. Francis of Assisi , and presumably Saint Longin . * In the old chapel of the Grand Seminary of Quimper, on the Epistle side 4, in the stained glass window ( 1896 ) which is above the altar of the Sacred Heart, we can see Victoire kneeling and holding an image of the Sacred Heart in front of Blessed Françoise d'Amboise (Duchess of Brittany from 1450 to 1457 then Carmelite), while her uncle Bishop Toussaint Conen of Saint-Luc knelt before Saint Vincent Ferrier, famous Dominican preacher who died in Vannes in 1419 . * In the parish church of Saint-Tudec-et-Sainte-Anne in Landudec , she is also represented on the stained glass window of the Sacré-Coeur (J.-P. Florence Studio, 1905 ), located on the Sainte-Anne altar. In the center of the stained glass window is the Sacred Heart; on the right side, Victoire kneeling, showing the image of the Sacred Heart, painted and embroidered by her standing; Behind her stands Marguerite-Marie Alacoque. Also on the left Bishop Toussaint Conen of Saint Luc, the uncle of Victoire and last bishop of Cornouaille, and behind him the Jesuit father Claude La Colombière , apostle of the devotion of the Sacred Heart. In 1923 , a private primary school of girls \\"Victoire Conen de Saint-Luc\\", with internship, was built in Landudec. == References Sources== * Mother Saint-Patrick, Victoire de Saint-Luc, a martyr under the terror, London, Longmans, Green and Co, 1920 ==Bibliography== * Hervé Gourmelon, The tragic Destiny of five inhabitants of Brittany in 1794 under Terror: Victoire Conen of Saint-Luc and his parents, Anne Pichot of Querdisien, Petronille Bochhen , Christian editions, 2007, 228 p. * (in Breton) Jean-Marie Le Gall, Buez Victory of Saint Luc: leanez e kouent arretret e Kemper , Brest, 1921, 104 p. * Alexis Cosnier, A Lady of the Retirement of Quimper martyrdom under the Terror (1761-1794), Paris, Gabriel Beauchesne, 1919, 423 p., Available http://www.liberius.net/livres/Victoire_Conen_de_Saint-Luc_000000825.pdf [archive] ( hagiography). * Pierre-Xavier Pouplard, A martyrdom in the last days of the Terror: Victory of Saint-Luc, Lady of the Retreat in Quimper, Lille, Desclée de Brouwer, 1882, 286 p. * Paul Debuchy, The Retirement of Quimper and Victory Conen of Saint Luke, Collection of the Library of the Exercises of Saint Ignatius No. 31, 1910, 96 p.

The 9th Berlin Biennale proposed to explore the present moment which, according to the official press release “[...] is unknowable, unpredictable, and incomprehensible—forged by a persistent commitment to a set of fictions.” ==Projects and Artists== DIS chose to create a separate website for the 9th Berlin Biennale, in addition to the institutional website. Thus the internet is considered one of the venues within which the Biennale occurred and is now archived. Babak Radboy (of art collective Shanzhai Biennial) was invited by DIS to implement the communications strategy in general. The other venues were the KW Institute for Contemporary Art, Akademie der Kunste, The European School of Management and Technology (ESMT), The Feuerle Collection, and a blue-star sightseeing boat. Artists invited included Ryan Trecartin and Lizzie Fitch, South African collective CUSS Group, Cecile B. Evans, fashion brand TELFAR, Jon Rafman, Amalia Ulman, Wu Tsang, Anna Uddenberg, GCC, and others. Anthem, the official soundtrack for the biennial, was released as a limited edition of vinyl singles released throughout the duration of the show, with collaborative tracks by artists and musicians, such as Isa Genzken and Total Freedom. Artist Trevor Paglen collaborated with hacker and computer security researcher Jacob Appelbaum to create Autonomy Cube, a “usable sculpture” that is a router for the anonymous internet software Tor. The room where the piece is installed becomes a secure, anonymous hotspot, with the hardware that enables internet freedom at its heart. Persian Gulf based collective GCC filled a large room in an upper floor of the European School of Management and Technology with sand, a maroon track field, and the sculptures of a mother and son in contemporary attire from Arab States of the Persian Gulf. New Age aphorisms play over the speakers, and the mother’s pose indicates that she is practicing “quantum touch” on her child. A windswept scene of modern, globally hybridized beliefs, the installation expresses how capitalist and spiritual trends alike have been adopted in their highly traditional but swiftly modernizing home states. Anna Uddenberg’s figures, part-human, part-cargo, and at times, part architectural elements, were also included. A Blue-Star tour boat was the venue for Korakrit Arunanondchai and Alex Gvojic’s collaborative work for the Biennale, and hosted Boat Rage, a series of events that spanned musical performances, literary readings, and fashion presentations along the Spree. ==Critical reception and Controversy== The 9th Berlin Biennale stirred some controversy among critics and audiences. James Farago, of the Guardian, wrote a scathing review, describing the art event as ‘an ultra-slick, ultra- sarcastic biennial, replete with ads, avatars, custom security guard uniforms, a manic social media presence disposed to hashtags like #BiennaleGlam, and a woman lip syncing to Trap Queen. However, it is for these same reasons that the Biennale was equally celebrated. In the September 2016 Issue of Artforum, British artist Hannah Black wrote that “…They [DIS] have been greeted, just like the modernist avant-gardes were in their time, with accusations of bad politics and even worse taste. Perhaps these critics haven’t noticed: The world is a ruin, but we go on living in it…” Many reviews have characterized the 9th Berlin Biennale as a gesamtkunstwerk. When reviewing the 2017 Documenta in Athens, art historian Susanne von Falkenhausen referenced her reaction to DIS’s 2016 Berlin Biennale 9: “That exhibition rigorously, to the point of cynicism, followed the web 2.0 world of digital prosumer reality and the moral ambiguity of its promises and aesthetics. In my view, it catered to a young, white, middle-class audience, but now it strikes me as more realistic than what we are seeing today: an outsourcing to the (post-)colonial other of the political, guilt, spiritual desire and collectivity that plague the Western-Northern self.\\" ==ReferencesExternal links== * The 9th Berlin Biennale * The 9th Berlin Biennale Press Category:Art biennials ","title":"9th Berlin Biennale for Contemporary Art"},{"id":"54119268","text":"Colette Burson (born June 22, 1970) is an American television writer, screenwriter, producer and director.

Because of its architectural and urban, cultural and historical value, the building has the status of a cultural monument.Dosije spomenika kulture, Dokumentacija Zavoda za zaštitu spomenika kulture grada Beograda, SK 177 The time before the outbreak of the Second World War was a time of growing instability, inflation and spiritual pressure of totalitarian regimes. The institution which erected the building – Privileged export company – strengthened on the wave of inflation and the need for countries to promote exports. Since it had a special significance for the economy of the country, but until then it operated in rented premises, the company raised its own, luxury, monumental home. On the basis of a competition conducted in 1937, according to the project of the architect Bogdan Nestorović, the administrative building of the Privileged export joint stock company (PRIZAD) was built. Since the field falls naturally from Obilićev venac to the Sava River, the building found itself in a dominant position. In designing this building of non-ornamental modernist architecture, there is a visible influence of architecture of totalitarian regimes (Italy and Germany), but also the influence of the French monumentalism. With its harmonious relationship of form and purified non-ornamental facades, the building is identified as a key achievement of Belgrade construction of the fourth decade of the last century, and it has a prominent place in the creative work of the architect Bogdan Nestorović. After the war, the building was the seat of the OZNA. From the beginning of the sixties of the 20th century, the building was the seat of TANJUG (Telegraphic Agency of New Yugoslavia), a very important public institution.http://beogradskonasledje.rs/kd/zavod/stari_grad/zgrada_prizad-a.html From this time, a standing sculpture of Moše Pijade, a longtime journalist and publicist, was set in the lobby of the building. == See also == * List of cultural monuments in Belgrade == References  External links == * Republic Institute for the Protection of Cultural Monuments – Belgrade * Republic Institute for the Protection of Cultural Monuments-Belgrade/Immovable cultural property base * List of monuments Category:Buildings and structures in Belgrade Category:Buildings and structures completed in 1937 ","title":"PRIZAD building"},{"id":"54119315","text":"\\"Sleepy\\" () is 1888 a short story by Anton Chekhov. ==Publication== Chekhov wrote the story in the course of one day, while working upon The Steppe, so as to 'get some money to deal with the beginning-of-the-month payments', as he explained to Alexey Pleshcheyev in a 23 January letter.

The play is set in Soweto in the 1970s. ==Synopsis== The main character is Masechaba (Mother of Nation) a black African poet whose activist poetry attracts the attention of a senior Police official, Major Whitebeard. Whitebeard and his subordinate, black officer named Jonathan interrogates Masechaba and warns her to stop reciting her poetry. The play illustrates quarrels and rebellions of the indigenous population. Whitebeard refers to her poem called, \\"The Spirit of Nation\\" and tries to convince her that her poetry causes hate towards the South African government. He tries to persuade Masechaba to write about flowers, beautiful scenery, and happiness to help soothe tensions in Soweto. Masechaba lashes back that all the flowers are dead, her people are impoverished, and that her people are being slaughtered in the streets. Masechaba argues that her poetry depicts the truth of the situation in South Africa and claims that her poetry is not inflammatory. When Masechaba persists in reciting her work, Whitebeard gives her a \\"banning order\\" forbidding her to recite her poetry, to gather in large numbers, requiring her to report to local police and to follow a strict curfew. When Masechaba breaks the terms of the banning order she is seized, interrogated and tortured to death by Jonathan under Whitebeard's orders. The two then discuss how they can cover up Masechaba's murder as they had done so many times before. The play ends with Whitebeard reassuring Jonathan. The Wadworth Anthology of Drama written by W.

Dual citizenship  The previously dormant issue of dual citizenship was raised during the election. The ruling party, APC, raised the issue citing Section 76(1) of the 1991 Constitution, which states that “No person shall be qualified for election as a Member of Parliament — if he is a naturalised citizen of Sierra Leone or is a citizen of a country other than Sierra Leone having become such a citizen voluntarily or is under a declaration of allegiance to such a country.” The dual citizenship debate engulfed three presidential candidates: Kandeh Kolleh Yumkella of the National Grand Coalition (NGC), Dr. Samura Kamara of the All People's Congress (APC), and Mohamed Kamarainba Mansaray of the Alliance Democratic Party (ADP). Yumkella claimed he denounced his American citizenship in 2017, while Mansaray said he has never held any other citizenship. Two cases were brought to the Supreme Court: one filed on 5 February by an activist of the ruling All Peoples Congress party claiming that Yumkella is a naturalised citizen and therefore unqualified to contest the elections; and another filed by Charles Margai, a flag bearer for People's Movement for Democratic Change (PMDC), claiming that the APC’s standard bearer is unqualified to run for president because he is a dual citizen and did not resign his ministerial position – for which he was paid from the state’s consolidated revenue – long enough to meet the constitutional requirement. The defense of Yumkella appealed to the Supreme Court to have two of the judges removed from the case, then the matter was adjourned until 28 March (after the 7 March election) for the two new judges to study the case. The dual citizenship issue will be remembered by citizens for propagating the slang term two-SIM to describe a person with dual citizenship. ==Results== The National Electoral Commission reported 3,178,663 registered voters (of which 1,654,228 were female) and a voter turnout of 2,676,549 (84.2%) across 3,300 polling centres and 11,122 polling stations.

This is somewhat similar to loot boxes, inducing players to spend in-game currency to receive a random virtual item. Most of these games are free-to-play mobile games, where the serves as an incentive to spend real- world money. The game model began to be widely used in the early 2010s, faring particularly well in Japan. Almost all of the highest-grossing mobile games in Japan use it, and it has become an integral part of Japanese mobile game culture. Outside Japan, the game mechanism is also gaining popularity and is included in various Chinese and Korean games. ==Model== A typical mechanism sequence in Fate/Grand Order, known as Summon Spirit Origin In these games, there are usually numerous characters, cards, or other items that players can obtain, and most of them are only obtainable via a \\"gacha\\" mechanism. This allow players to \\"pull\\" or \\"spin\\" the (analogous to a slot machine or roulette wheel) using a specific amount of in-game currency, which will then give the player a randomized character, card, or other item. Sometimes, these are limited, such that specific prizes can only be obtained within a specific event time-frame. Because some of the rewards have a lower chance to appear, typically players must spin the many times before they get their desired outcome. In many games, are essential for players to make progress in the game. Players may be given free or discounted , but have to pay to get more. These games may also feature different tiers of pulls, which give different sets of rewards. The model of has been compared to that of collectible trading card games as well as to gambling. An aspect of monetisation commonly found in the financing of games involves a model where a small proportion of players who spend an unusually large amount of money on rolls (via in-game purchases) provide the majority of the funding needed for the game's upkeep, essentially subsidising the game for other players who may spend smaller amounts of money, or even free-to-play players that spend no money at all; such players are often colloquially referred to as \\"whales\\". ==Types== Complete  , also shortened as \\"kompu gacha\\" or \\"compu gacha\\" , was a monetization model popular in Japanese mobile phone video games until 2012, when it was found to be illegal by Japan's Consumer Affairs Agency. Under complete rules, players attempt to \\"complete\\" a set of common items at random in a particular loot pool in order to combine them into a rarer item. The first few items in a set can be rapidly acquired but as the number of missing items decreases it becomes increasingly unlikely that redeeming a loot box will complete the set (see coupon collector's problem). This is particularly true if there are a large number of common items in the game, since eventually one single, specific item is required. Box  Box is a virtual box of set items with known probabilities. Its popularity grew around the time that the complete controversy was becoming publicized. As items are pulled from the box, the likelihood of receiving the desired item increases since there are fewer items in the box. It is also possible to pull every item in the box, provided the player is willing to spend enough. For this reason, some players will calculate how much money it would take to ensure they pull the item of their choosing. Redraw  Redraw allows the player to \\"re-roll\\" the if they receive an unfavorable result. Some games offer this feature for free. In games that offer an initial free roll upon commencement, players beginning the game for the first time may attempt \\"re-rolling\\" by repeatedly creating new accounts until they obtain the desired rare item or starting results. Consecutive  Consecutive improves the chances of receiving rare rewards when the player spends in bulk. As opposed to spending a set amount for individual rolls, a player can spend a larger amount in order to roll several times in a row for a slightly discounted price. At the end of the roll, the player receives all the items at once. Step-up  With step-up , the player's chances of pulling a rare item is increased each time they roll. This is very popular with heavy spenders, because with every roll the stakes feel higher. Open versus closed  that show (open) versus hide (closed) the exact probabilities of pulling rare items. Discounted  Discounted usually involve special campaigns or events by the game company to allow users to roll for a lower price. ==Appeal== Game developers have praised as being a great free-to-play monetisation strategy. Most developers that work primarily with free-to-play games recommend it be incorporated into the game starting with the concept for maximum monetisation potential. It has been debated what makes so addictive to so many players. Some believe that games play on the inherent hunter-gatherer instinct that people have to collect items, as well as the desire to complete a set. Others believe it is simply the replication of the thrill of gambling that brings players back time and time again. ==Criticism and controversy== In May 2012, an article was published in a conservative Japanese newspaper, the Yomiuri Shimbun, that criticized social networking games and specifically for exploiting the naivety of children to make a profit. The main complaint of the article was that the model too closely resembled gambling. The paper called for an investigation by Japan's Consumer Affairs Agency to prevent abuse of the system.\\"Social networking games must be responsible.\\" Yomiuri Shimbun. May 29th, 2012. Several cases of teenagers and even younger kids spending equivalents of over 1000 USD have been reported in the media. Shortly after, the suggested investigation was performed and the model of complete was declared illegal by the Consumer Affairs Agency, citing the , The Consumer Affairs Agency stated that virtual items could be considered \\"prizes\\" under existing legislation written in 1977 to prevent the complete practice in the context of baseball trading cards. Within a month of the statement being issued, all major Japanese game publishers had removed complete rules from their games, though many developers found ways around this. In addition, several lawsuits were launched in Japan against companies selling gacha products, leading to temporary decrease in their stock market value by almost a quarter. Japanese mobile game developers, including GREE and DeNA, worked to establish a self-regulating industry group, the Japan Social Game Association, which was an attempt to push developers from these models, but it did not prove successful, and the Association was disbanded by 2015. The mechanism has come under scrutiny for its similarity to gambling, and some countries require drop rates to be made public, or have banned certain practices (e.g., complete ). Many players also feel regret after making purchases in these games according to a survey. This type of game has also come under criticism for luring players into spending thousands of dollars at a time to get what they want, and the way outcomes are presented within the game have also been criticized. A 2019 research paper has noted that \\"the gacha system has proven to be addictive and problematic\\" and speculated that the loopholes in the gacha system could be exploited for international money laundering. == See also == * Microtransaction * Loot box ==References== Category:Video gaming in Japan ","title":"Gacha game"},{"id":"54119475","text":"The Fairy King of Ar (originally released as Beings) is a 1998 British direct- to-video fantasy adventure film co-written, co-produced and directed by Paul Matthews. ==Plot== Since as far back as Kyle and Evie Preston can remember, their grandmother told fantastical tales about fairies who had been trapped underground by giants for thousands of years.

Knowing the emphasis Jews placed on redeeming captives, Ibn Rumahis traveled the Mediterranean, selling Rav Shemariah to the Alexandrian Jews, Rav Chushiel to the Kairouan Jews, and Rav Moshe to the Spanish Jews.

It has long been pursued by West Japan Railway Company (JR West) and Nankai Railway in order to connect the Yamatoji Line (Kansai Main Line) and Nankai Main Line with Shin-Osaka Station, greatly enhancing both companies' connections to Kansai Airport and Wakayama Prefecture. As of 2017, construction is expected to begin within the next few years and last until spring 2031. Hankyu Railway has also announced tentative plans to build a new underground line connecting the Naniwasuji Line to Juso and possibly a Shin- Osaka Station of its own. == Background == While both JR and Nankai operate trains to Wakayama (via the Hanwa Line and the Nankai Main Line, respectively) and to Kansai Airport (both via the Kansai Airport Line), neither route is ideal. For JR, trains must use the Osaka Loop Line past Tennoji Station, both creating and being affected by delays on that line, and bypassing JR Namba Station, the company's closest link to Osaka's commercial center. Additionally, express trains to Shin-Osaka and Kyoto must use the Umeda Freight Line, bypassing Osaka Station entirely. For Nankai, all trains go direct to its terminal in Namba, precluding links to points further north. The issue surrounding Osaka Station for JR is set to be alleviated in fiscal 2022 with the opening of the first section (incorporated into the Osaka Higashi Line project, although construction delays have pushed its opening back 4 years compared to the rest of Phase II), which will terminate at new underground platforms of Osaka Station on a route replacing the aboveground Umeda Freight Line. Without constructing an entirely new line through central Osaka, however, the other problems remain. Plans were drawn up in the mid-2000s to alleviate the problems for both companies through the construction of a new underground line, primarily under the north-south thoroughfare Naniwa-suji (hence the name), branching at its south end to connect both the Yamatoji Line (Kansai Main Line) terminal at JR Namba, and a Nankai line, with Shin-Osaka via a new underground route through what was then the Umeda Freight Terminal. The Umeda portion of this plan was eventually incorporated into Phase II of the Osaka Higashi Line, with provisions in place for eventual construction of the Naniwasuji Line itself. Early plans for Nankai called for moving the Shiomibashi Line (the northern end of the Kōya Line) underground and connecting to the Naniwasuji Line via Shiomibashi Station (thus upgrading and increasing traffic on an otherwise lightly traveled, local route), but the company ultimately rejected this routing in favor of one via a new underground station at Namba. == Current Plans == Current plans are to begin construction once the Osaka Higashi Line opens to Osaka Station, with completion anticipated in spring 2031. Total construction costs, including provisions for the line at Kita-Umeda, are projected to total some 330 billion yen. In the interim, JR passenger trains will use a single- track freight spur from Osaka Station to join the Osaka Loop Line at Nishi- Kujō, much as they do now. == Stations == Excluding the northern terminus at the new underground platforms of Osaka Station (opening in 2023 for the Osaka Higashi Line) and the existing JR Namba, three stations (all names tentative) are to be constructed: Nakanoshima (in the vicinity of the Keihan station), Nishi-Hommachi (likely near Chuo-Odori and Utsubo Park), and Nankai Shin-Namba (underground in the vicinity of Nankai Namba, potentially underneath the \\"Carnival Mall\\" approach to the Namba Parks shopping mall). The line will also pass through the vicinity of Fukushima (Osaka Loop Line, Hanshin Main Line), Shin-Fukushima (JR Tozai Line) and Nishiōhashi (Osaka Metro Nagahori Tsurumi- ryokuchi Line), although no stations are currently planned for these locations.

Local architect Roland Wehner designed this house for his own residence. Its architectural influence are the Usonian houses designed by Frank Lloyd Wright. In particular, Wehner was interested in creating a \\"modular, affordable, and organic design\\" for his home. This was his first Wrightian design out of college. The Wehner's bought the property and moved their mobile home here in 1957. Because they had no children and limited funds, the main living pavilion and carport were completed in 1959. As the family grew the bedroom wing was added in 1964. The house is located on a wooded lot in a rural area. It follows an asymmetrical plan that is centered on the two-story living pavilion. The carport juts out to the northwest, the bedroom wing to the southwest, and the cantilevered deck to the east. Most of the windows face the east and south to take advantage of the sun, and to face away from the highway to the west. The exterior is composed of Anamosa Limestone and California Redwood siding.

Acting as antagonists of amino acids, they inhibit enzymes involved in amino acid metabolism and thus affect the physiological activity of the cell. These effects may be exerted as antibacterial, plant growth regulatory or neuromodulatory. They can act as ligands, and heavy metal complexes with aminophosphonates have had medical applications investigated. Phosphonates are more difficult to hydrolyse than phosphates. ==Preparation== Aminophosphonates are often prepared by hydrophosphonylation, usually the condensation of imines and phosphorous acid.

Companies organized as an entrepreneurial company have the suffix ‘UG (haftungsbeschränkt)’ appended to their names. == Background == The German government introduced the UG primarily to act as an alternative to establishing a traditional corporation.BGH, Urteil vom 27. September 1999 - II ZR 371/98 A UG established under German law is not a new type of legal entity; rather, it is a limited liability company similar to a GmbH, with the exception that, unlike the GmbH, it is not required to meet the legally mandated €25,000 share capital required of a GmbH—a UG can be established with as little as one euro of paid-in capital. However, a UG is still a separate legal entity from its owners and is fully liable for paying corporation taxes and publishing annual financial statements. UG entities can be recognized as not-for-profit, under the right conditions. The UG form has been met with great interest, especially by start-up companies and other entrepreneurs. As of January 1, 2012, there had been 64,371 of such companies formed. Since then, traditional corporations have been reduced in importance, having largely been supplanted by the UG (and also the GmbH) among new companies being formed.Kornblum: In: GmbH-Rundschau. 2012, S. 728. == Formation and requirements == Forming a UG is relatively similar to forming a closely related GmbH entity, however the UG is exempt from some of the capital rules applicable to a GmbH.  Company name  The company must bear the title “Unternehmergesellschaft (haftungsbeschränkt)” or, as an abbreviated form, “UG (haftungsbeschränkt)” (§ 5a GmbHG). Unternehmergesellschaft means entrepreneurial company and the German word haftungsbeschränkt means “limited liability”.Starting a business in Germany, Berlin 2017 It signifies the fact that the owners of the company have limited liability for the company’s debts.  Share capital  The nominal amount of the business’ shares - the so- called \\"ordinary capital\\" - as defined in the company agreement, must be provided after the foundation of the company and before its registration into the commercial register ( § 5a para 2 GmbHG). The total capital stock must be at least one euro. In practice, amounts of up to €1,000 are usually chosen. If the total amount of share capital exceeds EUR 25,000, then a GmbH is usually formed instead of a UG. (§ 5a para. 1 p. 1 GmbHG). In contrast to the GmbH form, no contribution in kind is permitted for a UG. The share capital must be paid immediately in full as a cash contribution (§ 5a (2) GmbHG). If capital of EUR 12,500 is available, either a UG (limited liability) with a share capital of EUR 12,500 can be established, or a limited liability company in the original sense, in which only half of the share capital of at least EUR 25,000 has to be paid. == References == Category:German business law Category:Types of business entity ","title":"Entrepreneurial company (Germany)"},{"id":"54119717","text":"The persecution of the Feyli Kurds was a systematic persecution of Feylis by Saddam Hussein between 1970 and 2003. The persecution campaigns led to the expulsion, flight and effective exile of the Feyli Kurds from their ancestral lands in Iraq. The persecution began when a large number of Feyli Kurds were exposed to a big campaign by the regime that began by the dissolved RCCR issuance for 666 decision, which deprived Feyli Kurds of Iraqi nationality and considered them as Iranians. The systematic executions started in Baghdad and Khanaqin in 1979 and later spread to other Iraqi and Kurdish areas. More than 350,000 Feyli Kurds had been deported to Iran as a result of the persecution campaigns and at least 15,000 Feyli Kurds have disappeared. Their remains have not been found. In 2011, the Iraqi Parliament voted to recognize the 1980 massacre of Feyli Kurds under the regime of Saddam Hussein as genocide. ==Forced deportations== In 1969, the Iraqi government launched a campaign of forced deportation and exile targeting the Feyli Kurds due to their ethnic background and Shia religion. In 1970, more than 70,000 Feylis were deported to Iran and their citizenship was revoked. Prominent and high-level Feyli Kurdish merchants and academics in Baghdad were specifically targeted. Numerous disappearances and executions were reported by activists between 1970 and 1973. On the 7th of May 1980, Saddam Hussein signed decree number 666 which legalized and ordered the confiscation, forced deportation, exile and detention of Feyli Kurds. Saddam justified the decree by accusing Feyli Kurds of having “foreign origin” and “disloyalty to the people and father land and to the political and social principles of the Revolution”. In the same year, the mass deportation of Feyli Kurds began in Baghdad and more than 300,000 Feyli Kurds were deported to Iran, many having had their property and official papers confiscated. The deportees were not allowed to take with the many thing a part from the clothes they were wearing when they were picked up from their homes, schools, government offices, workplaces, shops and military units. Male adults were randomly detained and sent to the various Iraqi prisons. It is estimated that around 25,000 Feyli Kurds died due to captivity and torture. ==Aftermath== In 2003, the UNCHR estimated that 65% of 20,000 refugees in Iran are Feyli Kurds who were forcefully deported during the genocide. Most refugees who returned to Iraqi had difficulties to apply for the citizenship. In 2006, the spokesman of Kurdistan Alliance, Muayad al-Tayeb, called on Iraqi and Kurdish parliaments to support Feyli refugees, stating that \\"Feyli Kurds have been subjected to persecution for three reasons, first because they are Kurds, second they are from the Shiite sect and third because they are patriotic people and joined the Kurdish and Iraqi national movement.\\" In 2010, the Iraqi Ministry of Displacement and Migration reported that since 2003 about 100,000 Feylis have had their citizenship reinstated. ==See also== * Anfal genocide * Halabja chemical attack ==References== Category:Lur people Category:Massacres of Kurds Category:Persecution of Kurds in Iraq ","title":"Persecution of Feyli Kurds under Saddam Hussein"},{"id":"54119748","text":"Bradley Christopher Jones (born May 20, 1963, New York City) is an American jazz bassist who performs on both bass guitar and double-bass.Brad Jones website, accessed December 10, 2019 Jones started on drums as a child and first began playing bass guitar at age 12.

Most state constitutions include similar definitions of treason, specifically limited to levying war against the state, \\"adhering to the enemies\\" of the state, or aiding the enemies of the state, and requiring two witnesses or a confession in open court. Fewer than thirty people have ever been charged with treason under these laws. Constitutionally, citizens of the United States owe allegiance to at least two sovereigns. One is the United States, and the other is their state. They can therefore potentially commit treason against either, or against both. At least fourteen people have been charged with treason against various states; at least six were convicted, five of whom were executed. Only one person has ever been executed for treason against the federal government: William Bruce Mumford, who was convicted of treason and hanged in 1862 for tearing down a United States flag during the American Civil War. However, this was under martial law, not Article Three of the United States Constitution. While treason is a criminal matter under federal and state laws, it may be considered a civil matter under tribal law. The Indian Civil Rights Act limits sentences for crimes by tribal courts to no more than one year in jail and a $5,000 fine. ==Federal== Definition: In Article III, Section 3 of the United States Constitution, treason is specifically limited to levying war against the US, or adhering to their enemies, giving them aid and comfort. Penalty: U.S. Code Title 18: Death, or not less than 5 years' imprisonment and not more than life imprisonment without the possibility of parole (minimum fine of $10,000, if not sentenced to death). Any person convicted of treason against the United States will lose the right to hold public office in the United States. == State == Alabama Definition: The constitution of Alabama defines treason in similar terms to the United States Constitution. Penalty: Not less than 10 years and not more than 99 years' imprisonment (eligible for parole after lesser of one-half of sentence or 15 years) or life imprisonment (eligible for parole after 10 years). A treason conviction also results in loss of voting rights for life without the possibility of voting restoration. Arkansas Definition: Arkansas legislation defines treason similarly to the United States Constitution, limiting it to \\"levying war against the state\\" or giving \\"aid and comfort\\" to the enemies of the state. Also similarly, conviction requires the testimony of two witnesses to the same overt act, or confession in open court. Penalty: Death, or life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. California Definition: Treason against the state of California is defined similarly to the United States Constitution. The California Constitution states that \\"treason against the State consists only in levying war against it, adhering to its enemies, or giving them aid and comfort. A person may not be convicted of treason except on the evidence of two witnesses to the same overt act or by confession in open court.\\" This is reiterated in Section 37 of the California Penal Code. Penalty: Death, or life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. Colorado Penalty: Death, or life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. Delaware Definition: The constitution of Delaware defines treason in similar terms to the United States Constitution. Florida Penalty: Not less than 5.5 years and not more than 30 years' imprisonment (minimum sentencing guidelines). Georgia Penalty: Death, or by imprisonment for life or for not less than 15 years. Idaho The state constitution of Idaho specifically disallows gubernatorial respite or reprieve for a conviction for treason. Illinois Penalty: Not less than 6 years and not more than 30 years' imprisonment. Joseph Smith and Hyrum Smith Death of Joseph Smith while awaiting trial for treason against Illinois After escaping custody on charges of treason against Missouri and fleeing to Illinois, Joseph Smith and Hyrum Smith were charged with treason in Illinois, which at that time was a capital offense. Augustine Spencer swore out a warrant alleging that the Smith brothers had committed treason by \\"calling out the Legion to resist the force under the command of the Governor.\\" On June 24, 1844, a warrant was issued charging that \\"Joseph Smith, late of the county aforesaid, did, on or about the nineteenth day of June. A. D. 1844, at the county and state aforesaid, commit the crime of treason against the government and people of the State of Illinois.\\" (Ludlow, pp. 1346–1348) Bail could not be granted for a charge of treason, so Smith was placed in jail where he was accompanied by his brother, Hyrum Smith, and other associates. On June 27, Smith and Hyrum were killed by a mob in jail while they were awaiting trial. (Ludlow, p. 860) Louisiana Penalty: Death, or life imprisonment. In Louisiana, all life imprisonment sentences exclude the possibility of parole. Maine Definition: The state constitution of Maine defines treason in similar terms to the United States Constitution. Massachusetts Penalty: Life imprisonment with the possibility of parole after serving not less than 15 years and not more than 25 years. Minnesota Penalty: Life imprisonment with the possibility of parole after serving 17 years. Mississippi Penalty: Death or life imprisonment. Missouri Definition: Treason is defined in the constitution of the State of Missouri. Penalty: Not less than 10 years and not more than 30 years' imprisonment (eligible for parole after serving one-half of sentence) or life imprisonment (eligible for parole after serving 30 years). Joseph Smith and others Joseph Smith and five others were charged with treason under Missouri law in 1838, spending over five months in prison, but escaped while awaiting trial. Joseph Smith and Hyrum Smith were later charged with \\"treason against the government and people of the State of Illinois.\\";. Nevada Penalty: Not less than 2 years and not more than 10 years' imprisonment (if imprisonment is imposed). North Carolina Article I, Section 29, of the State Constitution is similar to Article III, Section 3 of the United States Constitution, limiting the legal definition of \\"treason\\" to levying war against the State or giving \\"aid and comfort\\" to the enemies of the State. Conviction requires two witnesses to the act itself, or a confession in open court. John Sevier John Sevier, then governor of the State of Franklin and later the first governor of the State of Tennessee, was charged with treason against the State of North Carolina in October, 1788. After being transported to North Carolina, he was freed. The charge was never brought to trial. North Dakota Penalty: Not more than 20 years' imprisonment. Oregon Penalty: Life imprisonment with the possibility of parole after serving 25 years. Rhode Island Penalty: Life imprisonment with the possibility of parole after serving 20 years. Thomas Dorr Thomas Wilson Dorr was convicted of treason against Rhode Island in 1844 for leading a rebellion against the state government, and sentenced to life imprisonment. Dorr served twelve months of his sentence. He was released in 1845 after the Rhode Island state legislature passed an Act of General Amnesty. In January 1854 the legislature passed an act annulling the verdict of the Rhode Island Supreme Court. South Carolina Penalty: Death or not more than 30 years' imprisonment (if committed during time of war) or not more than 20 years' imprisonment (if not committed during time of war). South Dakota Definition: The state constitution of South Dakota defines treason in similar terms to the United States Constitution. Tennessee Tennessee has repealed its treason law. However, a person convicted of treason can never be eligible to vote in Tennessee. Texas Penalty: Not less than 1 year and not more than 20 years' imprisonment. Vermont Definition: levying war or conspiring to levy war against the state, or adhering to the enemy. This definition, in Title 13, Chapter 75, § 3401 of Vermont Statutes, echoes the definition found in the United States Constitution. Penalty: Death by electrocution. Vermont criminal law maintains the death penalty specifically for treason. No other crime is punishable by the sentence of death. The method of execution is specified as electrocution. Vermont's electric chair, last used in 1954, is stored in the Vermont History Center in Barre, Vermont. Virginia Penalty: Not less than 20 years' imprisonment or life imprisonment with the possibility of parole after serving 15 years (if imprisonment is imposed). Raid on Harper's Ferry John Brown was charged with treason against the Commonwealth of Virginia, along with conspiracy and first-degree murders after he led his raid on Harper's Ferry in 1859. In Virginia v. John Brown, he was found guilty on all three charges. He was consequently hanged. John Anthony Copeland Jr., Edwin Coppie (also known as Edwin Coppock), Shields Green and Aaron Dwight Stevens were also charged, convicted and hanged for treason against the Commonwealth of Virginia and other crimes. Albert Hazlett and John E. Cooke were charged with treason against the Commonwealth of Virginia and found not guilty of treason, but were convicted of other crimes. Washington Definition: The state constitution and statutory law of Washington define treason in similar terms to the United States Constitution. Penalty: Death, life imprisonment with the possibility of parole after serving 20 years, or any term of years. Treason is a \\"Class A\\" felony under sentencing guidelines, and current guidelines provide for a maximum sentence of life in prison and/or a $50,000 fine. West Virginia Penalty: Life imprisonment with the possibility of parole after serving 10 years or not less than 3 years and not more than 10 years' imprisonment (latter sentence able to be imposed at discretion of jury or court if defendant pleads guilty). Wisconsin Penalty: Life imprisonment with or without the possibility of parole (eligible in 20 years, if sentenced to life with parole). ==Tribal law== The U.S. federal government recognizes tribal nations as \\"domestic dependent nations.\\" Tribal sovereignty is a form of parallel sovereignty within the U.S. constitutional framework, constrained by but not subordinate to other sovereign entities. There is at least one case of punishment for treason under tribal law. In 1992, the Tonawanda Band of Seneca convicted several members of treason, stripped their tribal membership, and sentenced them to permanent banishment from the Tonawanda Reservation for attempting to overthrow the traditional government. ==See also== *Article Three of the United States Constitution ==References== Category:State law in the United States Category:United States criminal law Category:State constitutions of the United States Category:United States criminal constitutional law ","title":"Treason laws in the United States"},{"id":"54119815","text":"Paul Stephens (born April 23, 1987) is an American football defensive back who is currently a free agent.

Windows 95 reports to be MS-DOS 7.0, while Windows 98 and Windows 98SE report as 7.1. ==Overview== A major difference between earlier versions of MS-DOS is the usage of the MSDOS.SYS file.MsDos 7.0 from Windows 95/98 In version 7 this is not a binary file, but a pure setting file. The older boot style, where Windows is not automatically started and the system boots into a DOS command shell, could keep on using that same style by setting BootGUI=0 in the MSDOS.SYS-file. Otherwise, Windows from Windows 95 onward will automatically start up on boot. However this was in reality only an automatic call for the file WIN.COM, the Windows starting file. Windows 95 and 98 are both highly dependent on a Real mode system, although MS-DOS 7 possibly is more \\"hidden\\" than earlier versions of MS-DOS. This is also true for Windows Millennium Edition, but \\"ME\\" prevents users from using Real mode. Also the paths for (a plausible but actually not necessary) Windows directory and Boot directory is to be set in this new version of the MSDOS.SYS-file. Whilst IO.SYS (although binary different) remained as the initial executive startup file which BIOS booting routines fires up, if located correctly. Also the COMMAND.COM file keeps a handle on the command prompt. The typical DOS setting files CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT essentially retained their functions from earlier versions of MS-DOS (although memory allocation was no longer needed). Although only included in Windows releases (the last stand alone release of MS-DOS ever was the 6.22 version), MS-DOS 7 can fairly easily be extracted from Windows 95/98, and be used alone on other computers, just as the earlier versions. Actually MS-DOS 7/7.1 works fine on many modern (as of 2016) motherboards (at least with PS2-keyboards), in sharp contrast to Windows 95/98. Although it has to be installed at a fairly small partition, located at \\"the top\\" of the hard drive and formatted with FAT32. Another difference is that MS-DOS 7/7.1 requires a 80386 or higher processor, it fails to boot on 80286-class or lower x86 hardware. Any installation must be done prior to any Windows installation, and through the SYS command (executing the SYS.COM file), preferably from a folder on a Ramdrive created by a bootable disc. Correct versions of IO.SYS (especially) must exist in the same folder as SYS.COM together with DRVSPACE.BIN, MSDOS.SYS, MSDOS.--- as well as COMMAND.COM, AUTOEXEC.BAT and CONFIG.SYS. All other files can be copied thereafter. (In Windows 95/98 they are found in either the root folder or in the C:\\\\WINDOWS\\\\COMMAND folder) ==See also== * PC DOS 7 * List of DOS commands * List of DOS system files * Timeline of DOS operating systems ==References== Category:Disk operating systems Category:Microsoft operating systems Category:Proprietary operating systems ","title":"MS-DOS 7"},{"id":"54119926","text":"Major William Clive Hussey, (1858 – 20 June 1929HUSSEY, Major William Clive’, Who Was Who, A & C Black, an imprint of Bloomsbury Publishing plc, 1920–2016) was a British Army officer who was bailiff of The Royal Parks from 1902 to 1923. ==Biography== Hussey was born in 1858, the second son of Edward Hussey (1807–1894), by his wife Honourable Henrietta Sarah Windsor-Clive (1820–1899).

The part was introduced in 2013 and was named by EDN Tech as one of the “2013 EDN Hot 100” electronics industry innovations for the year. In a product review published earlier that year, EDN noted: This JFET is part of a family of ultra-low- noise, dual JFET. . ==Part characteristics== The LSK489 is an N-channel monolithic dual JFET with 1.8 nV per square root Hz noise at 1kHz and low- capacitance (Ciss= 4pF). The part is not graded with respect to IDSS, with the typical value being 5 mA, a low of 2.5 mA and a high of 15 mA. Characteristics include: *Tight differential voltage match vs. current; *Improved op amp speed settling time accuracy; *Minimum Input Error trimming error voltage; *Lower intermodulation distortion. The part achieves very low noise with respect to its transconductance, which is attributed to the producer’s ability to eliminate almost all of the generation-recombination noise usually present in JFETs. The part is available in TO-71, SOIC-A, and SOT-23 packages, as well as bare die. ==Related parts== The LSK489 (N-Channel Monolithic Dual JFET) and LSJ689 (P-Channel Monolithic Dual JEFT), also produced by Linear Integrated Systems, are complementary pairs. These two parts are the only complementary dual JFETs pair currently in production. The LSK489 is close in electrical performance, except for having superior noise characteristics, to the LS843 series and the Siliconix U401-403 series. It has slightly higher noise than the LSK389 (1.8 nV vs. 0.9 nV) but lower CISS (4pF vs. 20pF). ==Applications== The LSK489 is used in a wide range of front-end signal chain applications, including audio preamps, piezoelectric element preamps and photodiode preamps. The part is also used in high-end sensor systems ranging from hydrophones to the front end of the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) being developed by SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory. ==ReferencesExternal links== *Company Data Sheet *Company Application Note Category:Commercial transistors ","title":"LSK489"},{"id":"54120030","text":"Teetatch Ratanasritai or nickname Kaopun (born 29 May 1999) is a Thai singer and actor.

He was known for the direction of the feature film El Último Piso (The last floor ), selected to represent Argentine cinema at the Cannes Film Festival and the film El Terrorista (The Terrorist ), about real events. His films were part of the nouvelle vague of the Argentine cinema in the 60's and in his artistic production, both in cinema and theater, carried a strong political and intellectual content. He was known for the direction of the feature film El último piso, selected to represent Argentine cinema at the Cannes Film Festival and the film El Terrorista, about real events. His films were part of the nouvelle vague of the Argentine cinema in the 60's and in his artistic production, both in cinema and theater, carried a strong political and intellectual content. His films, of lamentable fate, were persecuted by the military dictatorship in Argentina (1976/1983). In television directed the consecrated Argentine actor in \\"El teatro de Alfredo Alcón\\" – winning program of Martín Fierro Award of the Argentine TV and was artistic director of diverse television programs. In Argentina, he founded the \\"Centro de Artes y Ciencias\\" where he was responsible for conducting important musical shows and cultural activities, before leaving for exile in Brazil. It is from this time the work with the musicians like Chico Buarque de Holanda, Vinicius de Moraes, Astor Piazzolla, Mercedes Sosa and intellectuals like Jorge Luis Borges, Ernesto Sábato, Rodolfo Walsh, Tomás Eloy Martínez, Augusto Roa Bastos, that among others add part of his cultural baggage. == Biography == Son of an industrial entrepreneur and a language teacher, who had 7 languages, his family had no close relation to art. He began as a filmmaker when he was only 14 years old, at a time (1947) in which there were no film schools in Argentina. Self-taught, he created his own program of studies and attended several universities as a student listener. He sought to study the subjects he considered fundamental and in which a film director should go deeper. At the age of 20 he directed an average-length film about a tale written by himself. His first feature came at age 24, with the film \\"El Último Piso\\", written by him in partnership with Tomás Eloy Martínez and Augusto Roa Bastos. He then directed \\"El Terrorista\\" and co-produced \\"Shunko\\". He began as a theater director in 1962, co-directing with Oscar Ferrigno the work \\"Georges Dandin – El marido Confundido\\" by Molière. From 1963 to 1974 he directed the \\"Centro de Artes y Ciencias of Buenos Aires\\", an important cultural house that fomented discussion and plurality of ideas, through the collaboration of artists, musicians, philosophers, sociologists and psychoanalysts, among other disciplines. In 1974, after a bombing attack, the current military dictatorship closed all the installations of the \\"Centro de Artes y Ciencias\\", forcing him to migrate his action to television. Finally, in 1976, harassed by the military repression, he exiled himself in Brazil where he lived for 40 years and continues his artistic career. He is married to the psychoanalyst Magdalena Ramos with whom he shares three daughters: \\"mine (Andy), “yours” (Carolina) and “ours” (Victoria)\\". == Exile == The military dictatorship closed the siege in the 70's in Argentina. Although not practicing any militancy in any political party, Cherniavsky was persecuted like almost all progressive intellectuals. Bombs were placed in the administrative headquarters of the “Centro de Artes y Ciencias” (\\"Arts and Sciences Center\\"), in the movie theater where \\"El Terrorista\\" premiered, on the stage of Mercedes Sosa and in the theater hall where Nacha Guevara presented the show \\"Las Mil y una Nachas\\" (One of the great successes of the Center and Cherniavsky). The latest incident resulted in the deaths of two people. With the kidnapping and death of the writer Rodolfo Walsh and Piri Lugones (press officer of the Institute) as well as dozens of collaborators being kidnapped, killed or exiled, he was forced to a constant daily pilgrimage to remain incognito. He took refuge in different addresses with his family (wife and two daughters 2 and 9 years old) not to be found. His wife, Magdalena Ramos, a psychoanalyst, couple and family therapist and a college professor, also suffered from the closure of the University of Buenos Aires and the prohibition of gathering groups. She describes her misfortunes and those of Cherniavsky in the book \\"Sou daqui e sou de lá – Autobiografia do exílio\\". The trigger for deciding the exile was the discovery of a list where his name appeared with the status: \\"marked to die\\". In September 1976, he runs away clandestinely of his country and exiles in Brazil. His family arrives a month later. Even today, he is painful to have left in Argentina his eldest daughter, Andy Cherniavsky, today a renowned photographer who at the time had already formed her own family. The disappointment and heartache for losing his history, his language and the codes of his country, made him take 7 years to return for the first time to Argentina. == Filmography ==  In Argentina  * 1954 – El Triángulo * 1959 – Shunko ( coprodutor) * 1960 – El último piso * 1961 – El terrorista * 1962 – Y dale que va  In Brasil  * 2002 – Buenos Aires Revoltada * 2006 – O Turista Solitário no Quênia e Tanzânia * 2007 – O Turista Solitário – Um Hotel sobre rodas na Chapada dos Veadeiros * 2010 – Essa Louca...

It is one of the three traditional schools of Prince William County Public Schools. The facility enrolls students from grade 1–8, and serves the communities of Manassas, Haymarket, Bristow, Bull Run, Gainesville, and Nokesville. The school is named after Philip Michael Pennington, a Prince William County police officer who was killed in the line of duty in 1990.https://pennington.pwcs.edu/about_us/fast_facts_about_our_school In September 2000, Pennington became the first traditional school of Prince William County. Since then, only two more (Porter Traditional School and the Nokesville School) have been constructed. Students must wear uniforms and follow a strict behavioral code, and both parents and students alike are required to get an amount of validated community service hours. Pennington has won a number of awards and recognitions for its academic achievements over the years, the \\"School of Excellence Award\\", awarded almost annually since 2001. Pennington accepts students based on a lottery. About 200 students apply every year, and about 120 are admitted. Most recruits are accepted through the first grade, where 75 openings are available. https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp- dyn/content/article/2009/02/27/AR2009022703661.html?tid=a_inl Despite lacking a sports team, Pennington provides clubs such as Intramural and the Running Club to students who want to be involved in extracurricular physical activities, and a vast selection of other clubs such as Chess, Creative Writing, Foreign Language, Girl Scouts, Robotics Clubs, Muslim Student Association, Stitching Club, EDGE club, and Yearbook among others ==Public Opinion== The school has gotten fairly positive reviews on Facebook (4/5)https://www.facebook.com/philipmichaelpennington/ and Great Schools (5/5)http://www.greatschools.org/virginia/manassas/3033-Pennington-School/ from parents of Pennington students, while former students blast Pennington via Google (2/5)https://www.google.com/#q=Pennington+Traditional+School&lrd;=0x89b65c6de364e0a5:0xa1b79af33eddf3e,1,. ==References== Category:Schools in Prince William County, Virginia Category:2000 establishments in Virginia Category:Educational institutions established in 2000 ","title":"Pennington Traditional School"},{"id":"54120249","text":"The fifth-generation Surface Pro (marketed as the Surface Pro, colloquially referred to as the Surface Pro 2017 or Surface Pro 5) is a Surface-series 2-in-1 detachable hybrid notebook computer, designed, developed, marketed, and produced by Microsoft.

The new Kaby Lake chips also feature improved Speed Shift technology, allowing the processor to transition between CPU states quicker. For the first time, both the Core m3 and the Core i5 models are fanless. RAM options are 4, 8, and 16 GB, and SSD options are 128, 256, and 512 GB and 1 TB. These are the same tiers that were available with Surface Pro 4. (Note, however, that not all RAM options are available with all SSD options.) In addition, the new Surface Pro features an enhanced kickstand which now opens to 165 degrees, allowing the device to lay flatter – a mode that Microsoft calls Studio Mode. Alongside the 802.11a/b/g/n/ac Wi-Fi radio, Bluetooth 4.1 Low Energy, there will now also be the option to purchase the Surface Pro with an LTE Advanced modem for cellular connectivity. There is also a full-size USB 3.0 port, microSD card reader, headset jack, Mini DisplayPort, Cover Port, and the SurfaceConnect port to connect a wall charger, Docking Station or Surface Dock accessories. == Software == All Surface Pro models (except in mainland China and Japan) come with a 64-bit version of Windows 10 Pro and a Microsoft Office 365 30-day trial. Windows 10 comes pre-installed with Mail, Calendar, People, Xbox (app), Photos, Movies and TV, Groove, and Microsoft Edge. With Windows 10, a \\"Tablet mode\\" is available when the Type Cover is detached from the device. In this mode, all windows are opened full-screen and the interface becomes more touch-centric. In mainland China, all Surface Pro models come with a 64-bit version of Windows 10 Home and a Microsoft Office 2016 Home & Student edition. Devices with Windows 10 Pro are only available for enterprise. In Japan, all Surface Pro models come with a 64-bit version of Windows 10 Pro and a Microsoft Office Home & Business 2016.https://www.microsoft.com/ja-jp/surface/devices/surface- pro/tech-specs The device also has a Windows Hello-compatible camera. It combines the use of a regular and infrared cameras to authenticate the user. == Accessories == Microsoft introduced a collection of new Type Covers, which employs the same Alcantara material as the Surface Signature Type Cover used in the Surface Laptop and Surface Pro 4 and is available in four different color options. An updated version of the Surface Pen has also been introduced, including up to 4096 levels of pressure and tilt support. Microsoft claims it is the \\"fastest pen in the world\\", with only 21 milliseconds of latency. Unlike previous models, this new version of the \\"Surface Pen\\" does not come included with the new Surface Pro. The new Surface Pro is backward-compatible with all accessories of its predecessor models, such as the Surface Dial. The new Surface Type Cover and Surface Pen are also being made backward-compatible with older models such as the Surface Pro 4 and Surface Pro 3. == Known issues == There was a Surface Pro issue where it had been prone to randomly hibernate and resume shortly afterwards without warning.Microsoft's new Surface Pro reportedly experiencing sleep issues - MSPoweruser This issue is mentioned on answers.microsoft.com and can be fixed by installing the latest Windows updates. Additionally, users have noted a significant and widespread \\"backlight bleed\\" in which the backlight from the Surface Pro's screen is visible on solid-colored backgrounds. ==Reception== Ryan Shrout of PC Perspective wrote that \\"from a flexibility perspective, there is no denying the Windows 10 advantage for consumers, students, and business users\\" over iOS.

He is the co-founder and President of Howling Wolf Productions based in Los Angeles, CA. == Education == Wolf attended New York University. He expanded his acting and improv education later while studying with The Groundlings. == Career == In 2012, Wolf wrote the film Guest House starring Michael Gross, Heather Lind and Mark Gessner. The film is based around real events in Wolf's life, and premiered at the historic TCL Chinese Theater for the HollyShorts Film Festival. In 2014, Wolf's production company, Howling Wolf Productions, produced The Quitter, an indie drama about a former baseball player who attempts to rebuild his relationship with his daughter. In 2014, Wolf wrote, directed and co-starred in The Walk alongside Peter Riegert. The film was adapted from an anecdote written in Rabbi David Wolpe's book \\"Why Faith Matters.\\"  Restoring Tomorrow  In 2016, Wolf completed Restoring Tomorrow, a documentary on the history and $150 million restoration of Wilshire Boulevard Temple, where Wolf's grandfather Rabbi Alfred Wolf served for 50 years and where Aaron himself attended and was bar mitzvahed. The temple was built in 1929 and was designed in part by designers from Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Universal Pictures and Warner Bros., much like a Hollywood set. Its \\"false facades\\" wore over time and the building became in danger of collapsing. In 2011, Rabbi Steven Leder began a campaign to raise money for the temple's restoration and in 2013 the restoration was completed.

Ke Jie was also ranked number one in the world under Korea Baduk Association's, Japan Go Association's and Chinese Weiqi Association's ranking systems. The version of AlphaGo in this match was AlphaGo Master, the one that defeated top pros in 60 online games, using four TPUs on a single machine with Elo rating 4,858. DeepMind claimed that this version was 3-stone stronger than the version used in AlphaGo v. Lee Sedol. AlphaGo Master was actually the second best version that DeepMind had at the time, for it was already in possession of AlphaGo Zero, a version much stronger than the Master version; this can be known by the fact that Nature received their paper on AlphaGo Zero on April 7, before the games with Ke Jie. DeepMind did not reveal the existence of AlphaGo Zero until the paper was published in Nature in October 2017. Before the Future of Go Summit, AlphaGo Master defeated Ke Jie by three to zero during its 60 straight wins in the online games at the end of 2016 and beginning of 2017. ==Games== Summary Google DeepMind offered $1.5 million winner prizes for this match while the losing side took $300,000 for participating in the three games. AlphaGo won all three games against Ke Jie. After the match between AlphaGo and Ke Jie, AlphaGo retired while DeepMind continued AI research in other areas. AlphaGo was subsequently awarded a professional 9-dan title by the Chinese Weiqi Association.

About 4 hours into the game, AlphaGo simplified the position, and it became clear that Ke was losing.

It was put into effect for the first time on 22 May 2017 following the bombing of an Ariana Grande concert at Manchester Arena and for a second time following the Parsons Green bombing. HQ Standing Joint Commander (UK) is militarily responsible for directing the deployment, if ordered.https://www.facebook.com/ArmyinSouthEast/posts/headquarters- standing-joint-commander-uk-has-relocated-from-andover-to- aldershot/1977121845863525/ ==Background== The plan provides for up to 5,100 service personnel from all 3 services to be deployed to \\"augment armed police officers engaged in protective security duties\\" at key sites in the United Kingdom. In practice, troops and military police would replace some police officers particularly from the Metropolitan Police, Ministry of Defence Police and the Civil Nuclear Constabulary guarding sites of national interest or critical national infrastructure such as Nuclear power stations, military garrisons, Buckingham Palace and Parliament so they can be deployed on either armed or unarmed frontline operational duties. According to government sources cited by the Daily Telegraph, it would only be triggered following a COBR meeting. The plan was put in place following the January 2015 Île-de-France attacks in France. It was intended to be kept secret, but was accidentally disclosed in July 2015 after being inadvertently uploaded to the website of the National Police Chiefs' Council. It was said to have been contentious with the Army leadership, due to concerns about it causing overstretch, training given to troops, morale problems and difficulties with deciding when to end the operation. The British armed forces have previously deployed to support the police, most notably during the Troubles in Northern Ireland when 21,000 troops were deployed to assist the Royal Ulster Constabulary in Operation Banner. In 2003, Tony Blair's government temporarily deployed 450 troops to Heathrow Airport and other London locations during a period of heightened terrorist threat. Plans to support the police and increase the numbers of officers deployed on the streets begun after the 2011 England riots Other European countries have also deployed troops to guard against terrorist threats in cities; France has deployed over 10,000 troops under Operation Sentinelle since the January 2015 attacks in the Paris region, and Italy also deployed 4,800 troops in Rome and other cities in February 2015. ==Activation==  Manchester Arena bombing  The plan was activated for the first time on 23 May 2017 following the Manchester Arena bombing. Prime Minister Theresa May announced that the police had asked for military support and the request had been approved by Sir Michael Fallon, the Secretary of State for Defence. The operation remained in force until the end of the bank holiday weekend, despite the threat level being reduced from critical to severe on 27 May. The website Warfare.Today identified the military deployment as involving units from the Foot Guards, the 2nd Battalion, The Parachute Regiment (2 PARA) and the Royal Artillery, with additional assistance expected from the Royal Marines the RAF Regiment and the RAF Police.  Parsons Green bombing  The operation was activated again on 15 September 2017 when the threat level was raised to critical in the aftermath of the Parsons Green bombing, with military personnel replacing police officers on armed guarding duties.  Coronavirus Pandemic  On the 22nd September, the Prime Minister stated in a statement to Parliament that he would actively consider the use of the military under Operation Temperer to assist police forces to enforce COVID-19 Restrictions under the Coronavirus Act 2020. ==See also== * Military aid to the civil power * Operation Banner, the operational name for the British Armed Forces' operation in Northern Ireland from August 1969 to July 2007, as part of the Troubles.

Founded by brothers Alejandro and Javier Escovedo, True Believers were rooted in hard rock with touches of country and the rebellious energy of punk rock. They found critical praise and toured with many leading bands of the 1980s but never broke out of cult status to achieve mainstream success due in part to their hard-to-classify style. ==History== The True Believers were founded in 1982 by singer-guitarist Alejandro Escovedo, formerly of the Nuns, and his brother Javier, formerly of the Zeros. The other two initial members of the band were drummer Kevin Foley (who was formerly in the Nuns with Alejandro) and bassist Denny DeGorio. Soon after they were founded, the band became very successful on the Texas club scene, and by 1984, they were touring with such bands as Los Lobos, Rain Parade, and Love Tractor. True Believers appeared in a 1985 episode of the MTV program I.R.S. Records Presents The Cutting Edge, where they were covered as one of the Austin bands then sometimes grouped together under the name \\"New Sincerity\\". The band released its first album, True Believers, in 1986 on Rounder Records. The album was recorded in less than a week for less than $10,000 with Jon Dee Graham, and was produced by Jim Dickinson. EMI America found out about the album from a distribution deal they had with Rounder at the time. EMI was so impressed by the band's debut album that they bought them out of their contract with Rounder, giving them more money to record their second album. In early 1987, they began recording their second album with producer Jeff Glixman, but soon after it was finished, EMI America was folded into Manhattan Records, and the album was dropped from the new label's release schedule. In late 1987, Javier left the band, which broke up soon afterward. The band's second album was not released until 1994, when Rykodisc included it on Hard Road, a reissue of the band's debut album. True Believers reformed in 2012 for a well-received performance at the SXSW festival. ==Legacy== William Michael Smith of the Houston Press has written that \\"In an industry littered with tragic stories of bad luck and poor decisions, the True Believers' tale ranks right at the top.\\" Jason Cohen of Texas Monthly has said that the Believers were \\"widely considered to be Austin’s best band of the mid-eighties.\\" ==Discography== *True Believers (Rounder, 1986) *Hard Road (Rykodisc compilation, 1994) ==References== Category:Musical groups from Austin, Texas Category:Musical groups established in 1982 Category:Musical groups disestablished in 1987 Category:1982 establishments in Texas Category:1987 disestablishments in Texas Category:Rock music groups from Texas Category:Rounder Records artists Category:Rykodisc artists ","title":"True Believers (band)"},{"id":"54120416","text":"The 1922 Middle Tennessee Blue Raiders football team represented the Middle Tennessee State University during the 1922 college football season.

She was a founding member of the Scottish Women's Rural Institute. ==Life== Veneration of the grave of Agnes Brown, Dean Cemetery Brown was born in Edinburgh in 1866 to William (\\"Durie\\") Brown (1858–1921) and his wife Jessie Wishart Henderson. The family lived at 125 Princes Street facing Edinburgh Castle.Edinburgh Post Office Directory 1866 Her father was an activist for women's rights. His opposition to taxes that differentiated between genders caused him to end up in Calton Gaol. Her father ran a number if fruit shops under the title of William Brown & Sons but he trained his daughters, Agnes and Jessie, well and refused to submit to laws that he objected to.Eleanor Gordon, ‘Brown, Agnes Henderson (1866–1943)’, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, May 2007 accessed 23 May 2017 He wrote a book about his experiences. Brown was an activist for the Women's Freedom League which was a suffrage organisation created in 1907 in reply to the Pankhursts autocracy. She volunteered to be one of the \\"Brown Women\\". The \\"Brown Women\\" were not named after her but after the brown coats that the walkers wore. It was Florence Gertrude de Fonblanque's idea and she, Brown and four others including Sarah Benett set off from Edinburgh in 1912 to walk to London. They had white scarfs and green hats and as they travelled they gathered signatures for a petition for women's rights. The hikers had to walk fifteen miles and attend a meeting each day and in this way they took five weeks to get to London. They followed the route of the A6 and they were joined by others along the way. On one day near Berwick they walked over 30 miles before being welcomed by the local member of parliament. Finally they got to London on 16 November where their horse and cart was sent back to Scotland. They went by tube to Trafalgar Square where the walkers entered to music. Rosalie Gardiner Jones was a supporter of the “Pankhursts,”. She organised walks in America that were similar to the \\"Brown Wowem\\" walks. One of Jones Suffrage Hikes include the hike to Albany, New York in December 1912. With a father who had been a de facto political prisoner she supported the idea that men could be members of the Women's Freedom League. In 1913 a group of professional men failed to get a meeting with Asquith to discuss extending votes to women. That group formed the Northern Men's Federation for Women's Suffrage and Agnes volunteered to be their secretary. In 1917 she became an area organiser at the first meeting of the Scottish Women's Rural Institutes as they assisted Scottish agriculture but in time they were cut out of the organisation by the Scottish board of agriculture. In 1918 she was one of the founding members of the Edinburgh Women Citizens Association which was one of many WCAs that were formed across the country to educate new women voters. Other members were Sarah Siddons, Lillias Tait Mitchell , Agnes Syme Macdonald and Alexi Buttar Jack.Edinburgh Women Citizens Association, WomenofScotland.org, Retrieved 24 May 2017 Brown wrote articles and plays and participated in societies such as the Edinburgh Dickens Fellowship, learned to type and ride a bicycle. It was said that she was the first women to be seen cycling in Scotland. She continued to walk. Not content with the Brown Women walk she repeated a similar walk but this time she set off from John O Groats. As she travelled to London she reported on her journey in the Weekly Scotsman. Brown died on 1 December 1943 and was buried with her parents in Dean Cemetery in western Edinburgh in 1943. The small (and vandalised) grave lies in one of the central sections and is highly obscured by larger graves in front. She was noted in the Scottish Saltire Society who published her obituary as an Outstanding Women of Scotland Community in 2014-15. ==References== Category:1866 births Category:1943 deaths Category:People from Edinburgh Category:Scottish suffragists Category:Scottish activists Category:Scottish feminists ","title":"Agnes Brown (suffragist)"},{"id":"54120450","text":"Godwatch is a group of supervillains appearing in comic books published by DC Comics.

They planned to find Themyscira to free their father, Ares, from his imprisonment by the Amazons. Cale recruited her best friend Adrianna Anderson, who died and became the cybernetic creature known as Doctor Cyber while aiding her friend against Wonder Woman.Wonder Woman #16 (2017) Cale also utilized her personal bodyguard Colonel Marina Maru and her agents from Team Poison, a group of female mercenaries. Cheetah was at one time a member of Godwatch, as she despised Wonder Woman for allowing her to become a monster. Unbeknownst to her, Godwatch was actually partially responsible for Minerva's transformation into the Cheetah. Deimos and Phobos grew impatient with Cale, which led to several threats by the twins. Cale, fearful that the gods wouldn't return her daughter to her, sought out the aid of Circe, who transformed the twins into dogs. As dogs, Deimos and Phobos were forced into loyalty to Cale.Wonder Woman #20 (2017) Veronica Cale then captured Cheetah and forced her to help Godwatch locate Themyscira.Wonder Woman #17 (2016) Cale was reunited with her daughter, though Ares revealed that Isadore's body and mind would split again if they left his prison.

He started painting at the age of 12. Khavarani was trained in classical painting by Reza Samimi. In 1966, he graduated from The University of Tehran having completed a Master's in Architecture and a PhD in Urban Design. Khavarani started his career as an architect. In 1965, his conceptual design for the City Theater of Tehran was selected by an international jury. Khavarani moved to the United States in 1981. After he took residency in Los Angeles, California he had to start his architectural career all over. His first project in the States was in Beverly Hills. After the completion of that project in 1984, Khavarani won the CALBO Award of Excellence in the single-family category. He later designed the World Trade Bank of Beverly Hills, for which he won a design award from the City of Beverly Hills Architectural Commission. Khavarani took painting more seriously after arriving in the States. In the 1990s, he started studying philosophy and found inspiration in the works of the Persian poet Rumi. Khavarani's painting style was discovered by the late Professor Albert Boime, a Social Art Historian from UCLA. Boime wrote The Birth of Abstract Romanticism, Art for a New Humanity, Rumi and the Paintings of Kamran Khavarani, dedicating the entire volume to the works of Kamran Khavarani. Professor Albert Boime credited Khavarani for the creation of an artistic movement through his new style of painting, \\"Abstract Romanticism,\\" and called it a \\"one-person movement\\" In 2010, Khavarani's drawing, titled \\"The Bird of Freedom\\" was presented by Nowruz Commission to the spirit of Thomas Jefferson and accepted into the Library of Congress by James Hadley Billington. This presentation was officially noted in the Congressional Records and became part of the United States history. In 2011, the National Ethnic Coalition of Organizations awarded Khavarani the Ellis Island Medal of Honor in recognition of his contributions to America. In 2013, the potential therapeutic effect of his artwork was undergoing academic research. ==Style and Technique== Khavarani is trained in classical painting, his early works were painted in this style. His works also include ink sketches and lifelike portraits In more recent years, his paintings are inspired by the Persian poet Jalal ad-Din Rumi. Rumi emphasizes the freedom of and individuality of creation obtained through love and joy and the fluidity of reinventing itself, but to viewers these connections are indistinguishable. Yet, his paintings hold the capacity to endow a heightened state of mind associated with the themes of Rumi. Common motifs of his paintings include plants: such as flowers and trees, the four elements: earth, wind, water and fire, and he uses the theme of creation or Genesis. This new style of painting is in the genre of \\"Abstract Romanticism\\", described by Albert Boime as: \\"The debut of a new art form, bringing emotion and beauty into the here and now. A dreaming for and of transcendence: an art for a new humanity\\". Khavarani mainly paints with his hands and wears gloves to protect his skin. ==Selected Awards and Recognition== *1984: California Building Official's Award of Excellence in the category of single family design. *1986: City of Beverly Hills Architectural Commission's architectural design award for the design of the World Trade Bank. *2010: The US Congress recognized Khavarani's drawing, \\"Birds of Freedom\\" and installed it in the Library of Congress. *2011: National Ethnic Coalition of Organizations (NECO), Ellis Island Medal of Honor. Khavarani's most recognized achievement is the creation of \\"Abstract Romanticism\\".

A Catholic convert, he was a protégé of Paul Xu (né Xu Guangqi). Like his mentor, he advocated repelling the Manchu invasion by modernizing Chinese weaponry and wrote treatises on geometry and military science influenced by the Jesuits' European knowledge. From 1630 to 1632, he served as governor of Denglai, a Ming district around Dengzhou and Laizhou in northern Shandong. He was deposed by the mutiny of Kong Youde and Geng Zhongming, after which he was arrested and executed by the Ming for having failed to crush their rebellion with sufficient severity. ==Names== Sun Yuanhua initially went by the courtesy name Chuyang. Upon his conversion, he adopted the baptismal name Ignatius (). in honor of StIgnatius, the founder of the Jesuit order. He then adopted the courtesy name Huodong, which loosely translates it. ==Life== A 14th-century Chinese illustration of the \\"flying- cloud thunderclap-eruptor\\", a native Ming cannon capable of firing cast-iron bombs filled with gunpowder Sun was born in Jiading in the province of Southern Zhili (now within Shanghai) in 1581 or 1582. during the late Ming. He passed Southern Zhili's provincial exam and became a juren in 1612. Converting to Roman Catholicism under the influence of the Chinese Jesuit mission, he became a protégé of Paul Xu, who instructed him in western mathematics and use of firearms. Sun joined Xu and his fellow converts Leo Li and Michael Yang in writing memorials supporting Christianity in response to the harshly condemnatory memorials published by Shen Que () in 1616 and 1617 after he became the vice-minister of the Department of Rites at Nanjing. In the end, the Wanli Emperor sided with Shen: A number of Chinese converts were jailed; Alphonso Vagnoni and Álvarõ de Semedo, the Jesuit leaders at Nanjing, were imprisoned and then expelled; and the Catholic buildings in Nanjing were demolished. After the fall of Guangning (now Beizhen in Liaoning) to the Manchu, Sun Yuanhua published two memorials advocating the use of European- style cannon to defend the capital and the northeastern borders and passes. He argued that \\"at this stage the army is terrified of the enemy. If we are not under the shelter of garrisons, our condition will not be stable [and,] if we do not use telescopes and excellent cannon to strike first from a distance of 10li or more, then the enemy will not be warded off.\\". Most such military memorials were composed by mandarins unfamiliar with war and consisted of general platitudes and historical anecdotes, often dating back to the Zhou or earlier. Despite a general sense of cultural superiority and desire for self- sufficiency—evident in modern artillery becoming generally known as \\"red- barbarian cannon\\"—and although Sun failed Beijing's imperial examination for 1622, his memorials attracted important attention at the War Ministry because of the strength of his arguments and the great and familiar detail he included concerning the construction and use of modern cannon and fortifications. On 15 March 1622, the supervising censor Hou Zhenyang, working at the Office of Scrutiny for Personnel, composed a memorial lauding Sun's talent: \\"Sun Yuanhua... should be employed urgently to cast cannon and to construct garrisons... Let [him] investigate and measure the terrain, pin down the routes that should be followed, establish a platform [for cannon] at each juncture and then, with the cost of one platform as a base of reference for the others, the entrances to the passes will be rock-safe!... Let Yuanhua teach the tactics to the generals and commanders, [since] only the people who actually make the cannon can teach how to operate cannon.\\" Hou was dismissed because of a memorial against Shen Que and the \\"Eunuch Party\\" but not before his proposals regarding Sun were put into practice. The war minister and grand secretary Sun Chengzong offered Sun Yuanhua a place on the ministry staff but acceded to his demands to take up responsibility in the war zone, making him a \\"military commissioner responsible for armament in the field\\". A general modernization program was delayed, however, when a 1623 demonstration of foreign artillery at Beijing went awry and a piece exploded, killing a Portuguese artillerist and three Chinese.. Though subdued, official interest continued: Yuan Chonghuan began supporting Sun's policies in 1626. An important meeting was held at Sun's Jiading estate around 1627, where Andrea Palmeiro, Xu, Sun, Yang, and eleven Jesuit missionaries planned the future of Christian expansion in China, including the status of Chinese rites and which Chinese name should be used for the Christian God. Following Xu and Li's 1629 memorials, the Portuguese captain Gonçalo Teixeira Corrêa was permitted to bring ten artillery pieces and four \\"excellent bombards\\" across China to begin the training of Ming troops in European-style cannon. Further reinforcements were turned back at Nanchang in Jiangxi, owing to an outpouring of official complaints when a sudden illness removed the threat of a Manchu assault on Beijing. The merchants in Guangzhou were anxious lest their special monopolies on Portuguese trade be curtailed but a memorials of Lu Zhaolong singled Sun Yuanhua out for particular condemnation because of his overly fond treatment of the foreigners.. In 1630, Sun received the title of Shandong's Assistant Surveillance Commissioner for \\"having penetrated deep into the camp of the enemy\\".. Liang Tingdong, the minister of war, offered him the post of governor of Denglai Dēnglái) in northern Shandong, but Sun was hesitant. He composed a memorial stating Rather than assuage Sun's concerns, he was ultimately ordered to take up the post at Dengzhou (now Penglai) with a force of 8000 Liaoning conscripts and the Portuguese instructors. There, Sun worked with Gonçalo and his translator, the elderly Jesuit João Rodrigues, to train Ming troops to repel the continuing Manchu invasion. He also began manufacturing his own cannon in the Portuguese style. In a report to the capital, Sun complained of the Liaoning refugees who had fled to his district in the hundreds of thousands that they \\"had seen few wars\\" and were thus \\"weak, deceitful, and completely unreliable\\". In early 1631,. the Korean diplomat Jeong Duwon visited Dengzhou while traveling to Beijing by sea, war having blocked the usual overland route from Seoul. Sun introduced him to Rodrigues, whose interviews and gifts on the occasion have been credited with the introduction of western religion, science, geography, firearms, and jurisprudence to Korea. On 19 January 1632, Governor Sun's subordinates Kong Youde and Geng Zhongming mutinied. Both had previously served together under Mao Wenlong, a Ming general executed for using his post overseeing the Yellow Sea to support and conduct smuggling throughout northern China. Rather than immediately attacking Kong and Geng, Sun attempted to negotiate a peaceful resolution of their differences. This proved futile and, on 11 February, their forces besieged Dengzhou. When the city fell a little over a week later, Captain Corrêa and 11 other Portuguese were killed in battle, 15 escaped only with serious injury, and Rodrigues survived only by jumping from the high city wall into the sea. Sun was spared by Kong and Geng for his earlier leniency but, for the same reason, he was then condemned and arrested by the Ming government. Xu, despite now holding some of the highest posts in China for his work reforming the calendar, was unable to secure clemency through memorials absolving Sun for Kong and Geng's actions. Sun's court martial condemned him to death and he was executed shortly thereafter on 7September 1632. ==Works== Sun assisted his mentor Paul Xu with the editing of his trigonometry textbook Principles of Right Triangles Gōugǔ Yì). Like Xu, Sun also wrote his own treatises on military science and geometry, incorporating the European knowledge being introduced by their Jesuit instructors. The mathematical works included the Miscellanea on Western Learning (Xixue Zazhu), How to Do Geometry Jǐhé Yòngfǎ), and Western Calculation Tàixī Suànyāo). One military work was his Jingwu Quanbian. His 1632 Western-style Masterpieces Xīfǎ Shénjī) became famous, advocating for the use of modernized fortifications as well as firearms. Sun was particularly impressed by the angled bastions ruìjiǎo) of Renaissance Europe's star forts, writing that, \\"with the angled bastion, the enemy is kept out beyond the walls and, when subjected to our attack, there is nowhere our guns cannot reach and the enemy has no way to approach.\\" His efforts to construct them in the 1620s were apparently neutralized by factional feuds within the Ming government and turnover of the responsible officials, however, and they did not become widely employed in China. ==Legacy== Kong and Geng, after considering their options, threw in their lot with Manchuria and rose to prominence under the Qing Empire it established. The Manchu welcomed their captured artillery: Despite continuing to call them hongyipao, they adjusted one of the name's characters to make them \\"red-coated cannon\\". The Xu and Sun families remained close. Sun Yuanhua's niece Ms Wang later married Xu's grandson Erdou. A detailed Biography of Vice-Censor-in- Chief Sun was composed by Gui Zhuang (1613–1673). Gui knew Sun Yuanhua's grandson Sun Zhimi and wrote the preface for his 1671 Jiangxing Zashi. Sun is the tragic protagonist of Ling Li's 1996 novel Qingcheng Qingguo. ==See also== * Christianity in China & Jesuit China mission * List of converts to Christianity from Confucianism ==NotesReferences== Citations Bibliography * . * . * . * . * . * . * . * . * . * . * . * . * . * . * . * . * .

Prior to that he read history at Magdalen College, Oxford, where he was tutored by the influential historians A. J. P. Taylor and K. B. McFarlane. He also did military service in the Royal Artillery. In 1951 he became Tutor in History at Merton, a post he kept until he retired in 1989, teaching alongside historians Robert Gildea and Philip Waller. He was also a colleague of J. R. R. Tolkien, for whom he had little respect, describing the author as “very lazy\\" and “the worst sub-warden ever”, adding that Tolkien-mania left him “baffled”. When champagne was ordered to mark Tolkien's donation to the College of his original manuscript of The Hobbit, Highfield remarked acidly: \\"waste of good champagne\\". Highfield served as Merton's archivist for almost 40 years, as well as other College offices. In 1953 Highfield began a series of annual history reading weeks in Cornwall, open to all undergraduate historians, a tradition which continues today. In 1997 he published the History of Merton College, which was jointly authored with the historian and archivist Geoffrey Martin, drawing heavily on documents from the College archives. Highfield's scholarship focused on late medieval Spain, in recognition of which he was awarded the Order of Isabella the Catholic in 1989. ==Selected publications== Roger Highfield in Cornwall in 1990 *The Early Rolls of Merton College, Oxford; with an appendix of thirteenth-century Oxford charters.

Listed at 5' 7\\", 130 lb., she batted and threw right handed. She was dubbed 'Pepper' by her teammates.Madden, W. C. (2005) The Women of the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League: A Biographical Dictionary. McFarland & Company. == Background == Born in Peoria, Illinois, Irene Kerwin only played during one season in the All American League for her home team in 1949. Kerwin started to play organized softball at some point between eighth grade and high school graduation. At age 14, she played for the Farrow Chix for a couple of years before working at Caterpillar and playing for its fast-pitch softball team in an industrial league. During that time, a common practice was to recruit people to play for Caterpillar based on their athletic skill level and offer them employment.A picture is worth one thousand memories. Caterpillar Official Website As a result, the Pekin Lettes softball team sponsored by Caterpillar was a huge success in Peoria, as they won several Illinois State Championships over the course of many seasons and entertained crowds, while averaging over 5,000 fans per game. == All-American League == When Kerwin was 24, she was approached by an All American League scout after a tournament. She signed a contract in 1949 that led her hometown team, the Peoria Redwings. She was used sparingly as a backup catcher and at first base while appearing in 27 games with the Redwings, who finished last in the eight-team league. Kerwin hit .173 (10-for-73) with two runs scored and one RBI while stealing one base.Madden, W. C. (2000) All-American Girls Professional Baseball League Record Book. McFarland & Company. At the field, she recorded 166 putouts with seven assists and turned six double plays, while committing six errors in 179 total chances for a combined .966 fielding average. The Redwings offered Kerwin another contract for the next year, but she realized the team did not have much future and might fold due to low attendance, and she needed to pay for college studies.Heaphy, Leslie A.; May, Mel Anthony (2006). Encyclopedia of Women and Baseball. McFarland & Company. She then rejected the offer and signed a contract to play in the National Girls Baseball League of Chicago for four years instead. At the same time, Kerwin enrolled at Illinois State University and the Peoria team folded a short time after. Therefore, Kerwin played basketball during her four years at Illinois and led her team in scoring every year, while playing also for the volleyball and field hockey squads.Tri-County Youth Sports. Greather Peoria Sports Hall of Fame website She received her degree in 1953 and played a few more years of softball for the Caterpillar Pekin Lettes. Kerwin played a total of 31 softball seasons, spending time at every position except pitcher. She also served as a player- coach for the Lettes, was a member of two Illinois basketball champions, and played in three national Amateur Athletic Union tournaments. In between, she also starred in basketball for four seasons at Peoria Academy of Our Lady High School, then was high scorer for the Lettes basketball squad from 1942 through 1947. Additionally, she won 75 Senior Olympics gold medals in 20 sports, including at least one gold in every sport. Besides, she holds 13 single- season and career records for the Lettes softball team. == Coaching and Retirement == From there, she went on to teaching physical education at elementary schools for 30 years and coached two unbeaten teams at Oak Grove School in Bartonville, before retiring in 1983. Kerwin earned inductions in the Indiana State University and the Illinois Amateur Softball Association Halls of Fame, and is also a member of the 1965 Pekin Lettes softball team enshrined in the Greather Peoria Sports Hall of Fame. In 1988, Irene Kerwin received further recognition when she became part of Women in Baseball, a permanent display based at the Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum in Cooperstown, New York, which was unveiled to honor the entire All-American Girls Professional Baseball League rather than any individual figure.Before A League of Their Own.

The circuit has existed in two versions, and has been exclusively used for the \\"Imatranajo\\" motorcycle road race. From 1962 to 1978 a 6.030km clockwise street circuit in the east of the town of Imatra was used. The circuit ran along the Vuoksi river and a railway line that had to be crossed. From 1979 to 1986 a shorter circuit was used. This was only 4.950km long and consisted mostly of the western part of the original circuit. From the 1964 season until the 1982 season the Grand Prix of Finland was run 19 times in Imatra. From the 1983 season the \\"Imatranajo\\" lost its World Championship status due to the dangerous nature of the circuit and the death of sidecar driver Jock Taylor in 1982. The last road race on the Imatra Circuit for many years was held in 1986 when a six-year-old boy died after falling under a running wheel, but classic races still took place.

The worm like larvae known to fisherman and a common name as blood worm due to its red color and elongated blood gills. ==Description== The common New Zealand midge is a two-winged non-biting Chironomus. These species are often confused with the biting mosquito as they look very similar. The males of this species have feathery antenna, and the females do not. The feathered antennas allow the insect to be able to walk in the water. The colouration of the species is black or dark segmented parts on the body (abdomen) with green or yellow striping. Chironomus has three types of teeth in its mandible, one single strong apical tooth, three inner subapical teeth, and a single outer apicodorsal tooth. The mentum of Chironomus also has 15 darker pigmented teeth on outer sides and either sides of the teeth. The adult is approximately 5mm in length. The larvae form is blood red and has elongated blood gills on its penultimate abdominal segments. == Distribution and habitat == Chironomus zealandicus is a native flying insect species of Chironomid that is endemic to New Zealand. It was first reported by Hudson in 1892 and was later described taxonomically by Frederick Hutton in 1902 and Kieffer in 1921 with the name Chironomus novae zealandiae. In New Zealand, this species is mostly found in freshwater and lake areas in North Island and South Island, such as in Lake Ngaroto in Hamilton, Lake Rotoroa, Lake Ellesmere / Te Waihora in Canterbury, and other South Island lakes and freshwater areas. C. zealandicus can be found in swarms in lakes, rivers, and swamps, where they typically breed in slow stagnant water. They are especially found in great numbers in areas which are man-made. The species often lives in areas that suffer from pollution; although, as a result of its make up it can withstand these conditions unlike other midge species such as a green midge larvae related to it. The myoglobin contained in the species (made up of an iron and oxygen-binding protein) helps them survive in habitats they are abundant in such as stagnant, low oxygen water. In New Zealand, the species is common in the lower reaches of the West Coast glaciers, geothermal waters and seashores. ==Life cycle== The New Zealand midge has 4 stages in its life cycle. This ranges from egg, larva, pupa and adult. The midge often breeds in swarms in areas of lakes and stagnant water which suits pupae and larvae to breed. Eggs are often laid in numbers up to 3000 and are contained in a gelatinous substance which helps it to attach to objects in the water such as sticks or to river or lake banks. The eggs which are not attached to any material sink to the bottom but this does not stop the eggs ability to hatch on the lake bed. The first stage (the egg) lasts between 2 and 7 days in which it hatches and then feeds on the gelatinous material for a couple of days. It then burrows into the substrate or the material available for it to make its home. Most of the larval stage is spent in a tube constructed from silt. During this stage, they take on a red colour which is where the name blood worm arises from. They spend 2–7 weeks in this form which can be faster or slower due to current water temperatures caused by season weather. After they reach the end of this cycle they pupate. The pupae creates burrows in the sediment layer, where as a pupa its lives in constructed tubes. The pupa stage lasts for up to 3 days where they emerge to the surface by actively swimming and stay on the surface for several hours until the adult form emerges. The adult stage lasts a maximum of 5 days in which they breed in swarms at night and then die. In the right conditions with regards to water temperature and season, the full life cycle can be completed within two weeks. ==Diet and foraging== The adult stage does not eat and this contributes to its short life; it is known as a non-biter unlike some related species. During undulations which are created by using 2-elongated blood gills filters oxygen and nutrients past them in the water layer. In New Zealand there are a wide range of strategies the midge uses as the fauna are so diverse. With this diversity in food selection it is able to get sources of nutrients from algae, microorganisms, invertebrates, macrophytes, and woody debris. ==Predators, parasites, and diseases== The midge from the larva, pupa and adult form is predated on by river fish and other aquatic vertebrates such as indigenous minnows. Examples of this are small trout which will come up and feed on the swarms above and on the surface of the water on warm nights. Other invertebrates such as arthropods are known to prey on midges, this is usually through chance due to swarms landing or getting caught in webs. Chironomus suffer deforming in the head capsules. A recent study conducted by Jeyasingham & Ling has shown that the incidence of deformity increased during summer in larvae, the cause to this incidence is season, genetic factors and sediment chemistry which may have caused problems to the deformity of the Chironomus capsule heads. ==References== Category:Chironomidae Category:Diptera of New Zealand Category:Endemic fauna of New Zealand Category:Insects described in 1892 Category:Taxa named by George Hudson ","title":"Chironomus zealandicus"},{"id":"54120849","text":"Steatoda fallax is a species of spiders of the family Theridiidae that is endemic in Cape Verde.

Before this, Intelsat 901 had been taken out of operation (having operated for about 18 years in another orbital slot) and moved into graveyard orbit where it docked with Mission Extension Vehicle-1 (MEV-1), a satellite service craft. MEV-1 then took responsibility of propulsion and attitude control of the satellite pair. The satellites then descended back to geostationary arc, where Intelsat 901 then replaced Intelsat 907's communications responsibilities. Intelsat 901 took over from Intelsat 907 on 2 April 2020.

In 1943, Time magazine reported that Goldsmith earned \\"radio's fattest writing fee ($3,000 for one show a week).\\" ==Early years== Goldsmith was born in East Aurora, New York, the son of Charles Goldsmith and Edith Henshaw Goldsmith. His father was the local high school's principal. Goldsmith's mother died in 1907; he and his half-sister were orphaned when their father died in 1909. They spent much time thereafter with an aunt. He attended Moses Brown School in Providence, Rhode Island, and the University of Pennsylvania. After one year at the latter, he went to the American Academy of Dramatic Arts. For eight years, Goldsmith taught high school students about health topics during the day and wrote plays during the evening. ==Career== In the early 1920s, Goldsmith tried acting, with bit parts in stage productions, including Chautauquas, in New York. In 1922, he began working with publicity for the National Dairy Council, a job that he kept until 1938. Henry Aldrich In 1943, Time called Henry Aldrich \\"U.S. radio's favorite juvenile\\") Decades later, Encyclopedia.com described him as \\"The quintessential teenager of the 1940s.\\" Aldrich first was seen in 1938 as the main character of Goldsmith's Broadway play What A Life. The play opened at the Biltmore Theatre on April 13, 1938. It ran for 538 performances and was adapted into a film (also called What a Life) that was released in 1939. A radio adaptation, The Aldrich Family, was broadcast from 1939 to 1953. Goldsmith was the show's sole writer for approximately seven years; thereafter, he supervised the work of other writers. A television adaptation, also titled The Aldrich Family, was broadcast from 1949 to 1953. Goldsmith was that program's sole writer for its first year, and after that he collaborated with other writers. Goldsmith based his writings on what he observed in the lives of Peter and Thayer White, his wife's sons from a previous marriage. Other television Programs for which Goldsmith \\"consulted or collaborated in the writing\\" included The Flying Nun, Leave it to Beaver, The Donna Reed Show, Petticoat Junction, and Dennis the Menace. ==Personal life== On July 2, 1921, Goldsmith married Margaret Towell in New York City.

Many chemical reactions can be described as acid–base reactions, so models for such interactions are of potentially broad interest. The model initially assigned E and C parameters to each and every acid and base. The model was later expanded to the ECW model to cover reactions that have a constant energy term, W, which describes processes that precede the acid–base reaction. This quantitative model is often discussed with the qualitative HSAB theory, which also seeks to rationalize the behavior of diverse acids and bases. ==History of the problem== As early as 1938, G. N. Lewis pointed out that the relative strength of an acid or base depended upon the base or acid against which it was measured.Lewis G. N. (1938) Acids and bases Journal of the Franklin Institute, 226, 293-313. No single rank order of acid or base strength can predict the energetics of the cross reaction. Consider the following pair of acid–base reactions:. :4F-C6H4OH + OEt2 −ΔH = 5.94 kcal/mole :4F-C6H4OH + SMe2 −ΔH = 4.73 kcal/mole These data suggest that OEt2 is a stronger base than SMe2. The opposite is found, however, when I2 is the acid: :I2 \\\\+ OEt2 −ΔH = 4.16 kcal/mole :I2 \\\\+ SMe2 −ΔH = 7.63 kcal/mole ==E and C equation== The E-C model accommodates the failure of single parameter descriptions of acids and bases. In 1965 Russell S. Drago and Bradford Wayland published the two term equation such that each acid and each base is described by two parameters. Each acid is characterized by an EA and a CA. Each base is likewise characterized by its own EB and CB. The E and C parameters refer, respectively, to the electrostatic and covalent contributions to the strength of the bonds that the acid and base will form. These parameters have been empirically obtained by using enthalpies for adducts that form only σ bonds between the acid and base as well as adducts that have no steric repulsion between the acid and base. :−ΔH = EAEB \\\\+ CACB This equation reproduces and predicts the enthalpy, ΔH, of a reaction between many acids and a bases. ΔH is a measure of strength of the bond between the acid and the base, both in the gas phase and in weakly solvating media. Entropy effects are ignored. A matrix presentation of the equation enhances its utility. Four values, two E and two C were assigned as references. EA and CA of I2 were chosen as standards. Since I2 has little tendency to undergo electrostatic bonding, the EA parameter was assigned a small value, 0.5, while the value of CA for the covalent property was set at 2.0. For the two base parameters, EB for CH3C(O)N(CH3)2 ( DMA) was set at 2.35 and CB for (C2H5)2S, diethyl sulfide, was set at 3.92. Fixing the parameters in this way imposed the covalent- electrostatic model on the data set by fixing the EAEB and CACB products of the DMA and (C2H5)2S adducts with iodine, and these four values ensured that none of the parameters had negative values. Due to increasing enthalpy data that became available since the EC equation was first proposed the parameters have been improved. Mixing E and C numbers from the improved set of parameters with older parameters will result in incorrect calculations and is to be avoided. A select set of the improved E and C numbers is found in this article and the complete set is available in the literature. EB and CB parameters for phosphines that can be used in combination with the improved parameters for oxygen, nitrogen, and sulfur donors to measure σ-basicity have been reported. ==ECW model== In the ECW model, a new term W was added to the equation. : −ΔH = EAEB \\\\+ CACB \\\\+ W The W term represents a constant energy for cleavage of a dimeric acid or base. For example the enthalpy of cleavage the [Rh(CO)2Cl]2 by base B involves two steps. The first step is cleavage of the dimer, which is W: : ½ [Rh(CO)2Cl]2 → Rh(CO)2Cl W = -10.39 kcal/mol The second step is the binding of B to RhCl(CO)2 monomer. In this case, W = -10.39 kcal/mol. In other cases, W is the enthalpy needed to cleave the internal hydrogen bonding of the H-bonding acid (CF3)3COH. W is also useful for a base displacement reaction in poorly solvating media: :F3B-OEt2 → BF3 \\\\+ OEt2 For any base, a constant energy contribution is observed for the breaking of the F3B-OEt2 bond. An ECW study of the enthalpies of a series of bases produces a W value that corresponds to the enthalpy of dissociation of the F3B-OEt2 bond. The EA and CA parameters that result are those for uncomplexed BF3. ==A graphical presentation of the ECW model== A graphical presentation of this model clearly shows that there is no single rank order of acid or base strength, a point often overlooked, and emphasizes that the magnitude of acid and base interactions requires two parameters (E & C) to account for the interactions. The plots shown in this paper used older parameters. Improved E&C; parameters are listed in the tables and in references 5 and 6. The EC equation from the ECW Model : −ΔH = EAEB \\\\+ CACB can be rearranged into a form which can be plotted as a straight line. 512pxC-B plot using only three Lewis bases to show this graphical approach. centerthumb In a Cramer–Bopp plot for Lewis bases, the parameter Ra reflects the mode of bonding of a potential Lewis acid partner, from purely electrostatic interactions () to purely covalent interactions (). The parameter \\\\scriptstyle\\\\frac{-\\\\Delta H}{E_a+C_a} reflects the strength of the bonding interaction. The plot shown here allows comparison of three chosen Lewis bases: acetonitrile, ammonia, and dimethyl sulfide. The Lewis acid iodine () will interact most strongly with dimethyl sulfide and least strongly with acetonitrile, whereas triethylgallium () will interact most strongly with ammonia and least strongly with dimethyl sulfide. The plot also shows that ammonia is a stronger Lewis base than acetonitrile irrespective of its Lewis acid partner, whereas the relative strengths of ammonia and dimethyl sulfide as Lewis bases depends on the bonding characteristics of the Lewis acid, swapping order when . (NB: Guesstimate). The Cramer–Bopp plot was developed as a visual tool for comparing Lewis base strength with the range of possible Lewis acid partners, and a similar plot can be constructed to examine selected Lewis acids against the range of possible Lewis bases. References 4, 8, 11 & 13 contain graphical presentations that define the ranking order of strength of many Lewis acids and bases. ==Other aspects and extensions of the ECW model== As mentioned above the E and C parameters are obtained from enthalpies of adduct formation in which the bond between the acid and base is a σ interaction and adducts that have no steric repulsion between the acid and base. As a results, E and C parameters can be used to glean information about pi bonding. When pi bonding contributes to the measured enthalpy, the enthalpy calculated from the E and C parameters will be less than the measured enthalpy and the difference provides a measure of the extent of the pi bonding contribution. The ᐃH calculated for the reaction of Me3B with Me3N is larger than the observed. This discrepancy is attributed to steric repulsion between the methyl groups on the B and N. The difference between the calculated and observed values can then be taken as the amount of the steric effect, a value otherwise not attainable. Steric effects have also been identified with (CH3)3SnCl and with Cu(HFacac)2. The use of E and C parameters have been extended to analyze spectroscopic changes occurring during adduct formation. For example, the shift of the phenol OH stretching frequency, , that occurs upon adduct formation has been analyzed using the following equation: : where asterisks on the EA and CA for phenol indicate that the acceptor is held constant and the frequency shift is measured as the base is varied. The asterisks also indicate that the phenol parameters are those for frequency shifts and not those for enthalpies. An analysis like this provides a basis for using EB and CB parameters as a reference scale of donor strengths for frequency shifts. This type analysis has also been applied to other spectroscopic shifts (NMR, EPR, UV-vis, IR, etc.) accompanying adduct formation. Any physicochemical property, , that is dominated by σ donor- acceptor interaction can be correlated with the enthalpy-derived E and C parameters. The ECW equations enables one to correlate and predict the enthalpies of adduct formation of neutral donor-acceptor interactions for which the electron-transfer is limited. For gas-phase reactions between cations and neutral donors, there is significant electron-transfer. The extension of the ECW model to cation-neutral Lewis base interactions has led to the ECT model.Drago, R. S. Applications of Electrostatic-Covalent Models in Chemistry, Surfside: Gainesville, FL, 1994. Others have concluded that the ECW model \\"is generally found helpful in many fields of solution chemistry and biochemistry”.Laurence, C. and Gal, J-F.

The agency splits its inventory of state highway mileage into four categories: *The State Primary System includes Interstate Highways, Parkways, and other long-distance highways of statewide importance that connect the state's major cities, including much of the courses of Kentucky's U.S. Highways. *The State Secondary System includes highways of regional importance that connect the state's smaller urban centers, including those county seats not served by the state primary system. *The Rural Secondary System includes highways of local importance, such as farm-to-market roads and urban collectors. *Supplemental Roads are the set of highways not in the first three systems, including frontage roads, bypassed portions of other state highways, and rural roads that only serve their immediate area. The same-numbered highway can comprise sections of road under different categories. This list contains descriptions of Supplemental Roads and highways in the Rural Secondary System numbered 2000 to 2499 that do not have portions within the State Primary and State Secondary systems. __NOTOC__ ==KY 2050== Kentucky Route 2050, also known as Herr Lane, is a state highway in Louisville in Jefferson County.

The earliest version of this text was likely composed around the end of the 12th century or the beginning of the 13th. ==Overview== The Blood Bowl Sutra describes how Maudgalyāyana, disciple of the Buddha famous for his supernatural or magical powers, descended to hell to save his mother. He finds her in the company of women who are tormented by the hell wardens and are forced to drink their own menstrual blood. They are punished like this because the blood produced by their bodies pollutes the ground and offends the earth gods, or ends up in rivers from which the water to make tea for holy men is drawn. ==Belief== China Japan The belief that women descend to the underworld shortly after childbirth has been present in Japanese folklore for quite some time. Story 9 of Volume 3 in the Nihon Ryōiki tells of how a woman died in labor and went to hell. Despite the Ōjōyōshū being one of the most important texts to describe hell, it bears no mention of the Blood Pool Hell. It is possible that the nature of hell as presented in the Blood Bowl Sutra was not introduced to Japanese religious thought until the Muromachi period. At Yama- dera temple, there is a pool called the \\"Blood Pond.\\" It is said that at one time, the Blood Bowl Sutra was used for dedicatory services to women who had died in childbirth. A similar ceremony was likely held at Gangō-ji. Until relatively recently, ceremonies surrounding the Blood Bowl Sutra were also held at Shōsen-ji temple. Believers would enclose a copy of the Blood Bowl Sutra in women's coffins in order to save them from being condemned to the Blood Pond Hell. A copy of the sutra discovered at Saidai-ji appears to have been used in a similar fashion. ==Sources== *\\"Childbirth, Violence and the Mother's Body\\" by Hank Glassman. * * Category:Chinese Buddhist texts Category:Mahayana sutras Category:Post-canonical Buddhist texts ","title":"Blood Bowl Sutra"},{"id":"54121316","text":"Drot may refer to: *Jean-Marie Drot, French writer and documentary maker *Drot, pseudonym of Oleksander Tysovsky, founder of the Ukrainian Scouting organization Plast ==See also== *Drott (disambiguation) ","title":"Drot"},{"id":"54121329","text":"Jubaoshan station () is an underground station on Line 4 of the Nanjing Metro that opened in January 2017 along with eighteen other stations as part of Line 4's first phase.

Flowering plants have a rosette of two to six stalked leaves and a single green flower which is white near its base and tinged with reddish brown to black and with a gap between the petals and lateral sepals. It is common and widespread in a range of habitats. ==Description== Pterostylis pedunculata is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber. Flowering plants have a rosette of between two and six stalked leaves, each leaf 10–65 mm long and 5–20 mm wide. A single flower 15–20 mm long and 5–7 mm wide is borne on a spike 60–250 mm high. The flowers are green, white near the base with reddish-brown to black tinges near the tip. The dorsal sepal and petals are fused, forming a hood or \\"galea\\" over the column but the dorsal sepal is slightly longer than the petals and has a sharp point on its end. There is a gap between the petals and the lateral sepals, which have thread-like tips 16–30 mm long. The sinus between the lateral sepals has a deep, V-shaped notch in the centre. The labellum is 5–7 mm long, about 3 mm wide, reddish-brown, egg-shaped, straight and just visible above the sinus. Flowering occurs from July to November. ==Taxonomy and naming== Pterostylis pedunculata was first formally described in 1810 by Robert Brown and the description was published in the Prodromus Florae Novae Hollandiae et Insulae Van Diemen. The specific epithet (pedunculata) is a Latin word meaning \\"small, slender stalk\\". ==Distribution and habitat== The maroonhood is widespread and common in moist, sheltered places in forest but also grows in coastal scrub. It is found from south- eastern Queensland to south-eastern South Australia and to Tasmania. In New South Wales it mostly occurs in coastal and near-coastal districts but extends as far inland as the Australian Capital Territory. ==References== pedunculata Category:Endemic orchids of Australia Category:Orchids of the Australian Capital Territory Category:Orchids of New South Wales Category:Orchids of South Australia Category:Orchids of Queensland Category:Orchids of Victoria (Australia) Category:Plants described in 1810 ","title":"Pterostylis pedunculata"},{"id":"54121370","text":"Samuel DeButts was a prominent Washington, D.C. area physician in the early 1800s.

Prior to his professional career, Anderson played college football at New Mexico State University where he studied business administration. == Early career == Anderson attended high school at South Oak Cliff High School in Dallas, Texas, where he played football as an offensive tackle and was a member of the track and field team. From 1974 to 1977, he played college football for the New Mexico State Aggies while studying business administration. As a freshman, Anderson started for the Aggies at offensive tackle. Prior to the 1975 season, Anderson was moved to the defense as a defensive tackle. He recovered two fumbles in a game against the Texas- Arlington Mavericks that year. In September 1976, Anderson recovered three fumbles in a loss against the Lamar Cardinals. He was named to the United Press International (UPI) All-Valley Conference team as a junior. Prior to the 1977 season, Anderson was considered one of the best defensive lineman in his conference and was named to the All-Conference preseason team. The Aggies moved Anderson to left end and he immediately made significant contributions, accumulating three sacks in the first two games of the season. Despite missing the final two games of the season due to injury, Anderson received many accolades for his performance as a senior, including an honorable mention for the Associated Press (AP) All-America team, a spot on the All-Conference team, and an invitation to the East–West Shrine Game to play for the West team. He was the first Aggies player to be selected for the East–West game. == Professional career == Anderson was selected in the ninth round of the 1978 NFL Draft by the Los Angeles Rams with the 246th overall pick. In mid-August, the Rams traded Anderson to the New York Jets for a draft pick. The Jets released Anderson later that month.

The terrain is largely flat or undulating, but includes mountainous areas in the south. It contains moist forests and large wetlands that are important to resident and migratory birds. The ecoregion forms a bridge between the Pacific coast ecoregions of Colombia and Central America, and the ecoregions of the Andes and Amazon. It is surrounded by the more populated parts of Colombia and is threatened by farming, ranching, logging, oil exploitation and water pollution in the main rivers. == Geography ==  Location  The ecoregion is in the north of Colombia, with an area of . It includes the flat landscape along the lower course of the Magdalena River, and extends west over the coastal plain to the Gulf of Urabá. To the north the ecoregion transitions into the Sinú Valley dry forests and Guajira- Barranquilla xeric scrub ecoregions. To the west it meets the Choco-Darien moist forests, and to the south merges into the Northwestern Andean montane forests, Cauca Valley montane forests and Magdalena Valley montane forests. The ecoregion transitions into the Magdalena Valley dry forests in the extreme south.  Terrain  The Eastern Ranges and Central Ranges bound the eastern part of the ecoregion, and the Western Ranges borders the western part, which extends to the Gulf of Urabá and the Chocó Department. A series of ranges run along the southern part of the region, the Serranía de Abibe, Serranía de San Jerónimo, Serranía de Ayapel and Serranía de San Lucas, which rises to over above sea level. Other than these ranges and some isolated mountains, the terrain is undulating. The center of the region is flat. The main river in the ecoregion is the Magdalena River. Other important rivers include the lower Cauca, Nechí, San Jorge, Sinú and Atrato. In the center of the ecoregion the rivers form the ciénagas (wetlands), a large system of marshes, lakes and ponds, of great importance to resident and migratory birds.  Climate  The ecoregion has a seasonal climate, with dry periods in January–March, when strong winds carry clouds from the Caribbean to the southern serranías, and in July–August. There is more rainfall around the Serranía de San Lucas, in the center of the region, and in the upper valleys of the Sinú, San Jorge and Nechí rivers. Mean annual rainfall in the lower areas is . As much as may fall in the upper river valleys and canyons. At a sample location at coordinates the Köppen climate classification is \\"Am\\": equatorial, monsoonal. The mean temperature ranges from in October to in March. Yearly total rainfall is about . Monthly rainfall is under in January and February, rising to in August. == Ecology == The ecoregion is in the Neotropical realm, in the tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests biome. The Magdalena-Urabá moist forests ecoregion links the Central American and Chocó ecoregions with the ecoregions of the Andes and the Amazon basin. It has high diversity of species and a high level of endemism. The ecoregion is sometimes seen as the eastern part of the Chocó, but it has different characteristics and different endemic species.  Flora  In the flooded areas vegetation is palmettos and wetland flora. In the drier areas the vegetation is dense, high rainforest with a rich understory, with great diversity of flora. Large trees include Anacardium excelsum, Cariniana pyriformis, Caryocar amygdaliferum, Caryocar glabrum, Cedrela odorata, Ceiba pentandra, Cordia gerascanthus, Hymenaea courbaril, Myroxylon balsamum, Ochroma lagopus, Schizolobium parahybum and Tabebuia rosea. The forest contains large vines that support creepers, Araceae and Bromeliaceae. There are more than 150 species of orchid, including Cattleya warscewiczii, Cycnoches chlorochilon, Peristeria elata and Psychopsis papilio. Endemic flora include Heliconia laxa, Heliconia lentiginosa, Heliconia rigida and Heliconia sanctae-theresae.  Fauna  Large mammals found in the rain forests or wetlands include Geoffroy's spider monkey (Ateles geoffroyi), cotton-top tamarin (Saguinus oedipus), white-footed tamarin (Saguinus leucopus), jaguar (Panthera onca), cougar (Puma concolor), ocelot (Leopardus pardalis), jaguarundi (Puma yagouaroundi), crab-eating raccoon (Procyon cancrivorus), giant anteater (Myrmecophaga tridactyla), South American tapir (Tapirus terrestris colombianus), red brocket (Mazama americana), gray brocket (Mazama gouazoubira), capybara (Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris) and West Indian manatee (Trichechus manatus). Endangered mammals include black-headed spider monkey (Ateles fusciceps), Geoffroy's spider monkey (Ateles geoffroyi), red- crested tree-rat (Santamartamys rufodorsalis), white-footed tamarin (Saguinus leucopus) and cotton-top tamarin (Saguinus oedipus). The ecoregion is a wintering place or feeding place for many species of birds. It provides the main winter habitat for species such as northern pintail (Anas acuta), American wigeon (Anas americana), northern shoveler (Anas clypeata), cinnamon teal (Anas cyanoptera), blue-winged teal (Anas discors), and osprey (Pandion haliaetus). Native species include great green macaw (Ara ambiguus), military macaw (Ara militaris), blue-and-yellow macaw (Ara ararauna), scarlet macaw (Ara macao), red-and-green macaw (Ara chloroptera) chestnut-fronted macaw (Ara severus), northern screamer (Chauna chavaria), Muscovy duck (Cairina moschata), knob-billed duck (Sarkidiornis melanotos), black-bellied whistling duck (Dendrocygna autumnalis), white-faced whistling duck (Dendrocygna viduata), fulvous whistling duck (Dendrocygna bicolor), black hawk-eagle (Spizaetus tyrannus), crested eagle (Morphnus guianensis), harpy eagle (Harpia harpyja) and blue-billed curassow (Crax alberti). Endangered birds include the recurve-billed bushbird (Clytoctantes alixii) and blue-billed curassow (Crax alberti). The ecoregion is home to reptiles such as American crocodile (Crocodylus acutus), spectacled caiman (Caiman crocodilus), Magdalena River turtle (Podocnemis lewyana), red-footed tortoise (Chelonoidis carbonaria), bushmaster (Lachesis muta), boa constrictor (Boa constrictor), green iguana (Iguana iguana) and gold tegu ( Tupinambis teguixin). Endangered reptiles include Dahl's toad-headed turtle (Mesoclemmys dahli). Endangered amphibians include the frog Sachatamia punctulata. The wetlands provide a nursery for a variety of freshwater and salt water fish species. == Status == The World Wide Fund for Nature gives the ecoregion the status of \\"Critical/Endangered\\". It is surrounded by most of the population of Colombia. Pressures come from large- scale farming, ranching, gold mining, oil wells and logging. It has suffered from warfare related to illegal narcotics. The largest rivers, the Magdalena and Cauca, are highly polluted. However, there are sizeable areas where there has been little human impact, the largest being the area round the Serranía de San Lucas. Several internationally-funded projects are trying to save important wetlands in the region. == References ==  Bibliography  * * * Category:Ecoregions of Colombia Category:Neotropical tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests ","title":"Magdalena-Urabá moist forests"},{"id":"54121434","text":"Dongliu station () is an underground station on Line 4 of the Nanjing Metro that opened in January 2017 along with eighteen other stations as part of Line 4's first phase.

The division divides the liver into two planes, extending from the Middle Hepatic Vein to the middle of the gallbladder. Using Couinaud's classification system, segments two, three, and both parts of four are on the left side of the division, while segments five, six, seven, and eight are on the right. It was first described by Scottish surgeon James Cantlie in 1887 when he noticed a difference in the amount of atrophy on both sides of this line of the liver while performing an autopsy. He concluded that the line dividing the atrophied segment from the hypertrophied segment must be the true midline of the liver, opposing the more commonly accepted opinion that the umbilical fissure divided the liver. The portal vein was already known to divide near the porta hepatis, as described by Francis Glisson in Anatomia hepatis, but Cantlie was the first to propose that the liver could be functionally divided into separate, distinct left and right halves. This was confirmed later in experiments done by Rous and Larimore in 1920 and by Schalm in 1956.

Conservation works were performed in 1988. == Appearance == Regarding the spatial and structural aspect, it relies on the traditions of the academy, while the formation was derived in Serbian-Byzantine style. With functional bases, basically simple architectural compositions, the emphasis is placed on the processing of the angular part of the building with a characteristic dome. The facade is asymmetrical, with a shallow avant-corps of greater width at one end of the building and large window openings that occupy much of the facade canvas. Richly applied shallow plastic decoration, reduced almost to the plane of the facade, is made of stylized motifs taken from the heritage of the Moravian school (rosettes, ornaments, geometric designs, chess boxes). Besides being a successful realization of the Serbian-Byzantine style in Belgrade architecture and significant work of art of one of the main proponents of this style, this building also has historical significance as a representative building of a specific purpose, documenting the development of telephone services in Serbia in the early 20th century.

Williams – chiefly in an eponymous monograph of 2003. Williams compares it with other frameworks such as Noam Chomsky's minimalist program, and argues that his proposal has significant descriptive and conceptual advantages over them. The substance of the proposal is that linguistic derivation is the result of mappings and mismappings between an open set of 'representations', which in one dimension correspond to increasingly larger locality domains and in the other pair 'syntactic' (sentential and sub-sentential) and 'semantic' (as well as pragmatic) levels. Cross-linguistic variation is then accounted for by the prioritisation of 'faithfulness' to some representations over others. ==See also== *Discourse representation theory ==ReferencesExternal links== *Edwin S.

At the same time, he uses his cell phone to conduct business for \\"Saul Goodman Productions\\". At the end of his four hour shift, his supervisor logs only thirty minutes, informing Jimmy that he violated the rules by using his phone. Jimmy changes clothes and drives to a reclining chair store to shoot a commercial. When it's complete, the owner declines Jimmy's offer to shoot more. After Jimmy and Kim go through their expenses, Jimmy hands Kim the money for his share, which concerns her because she thinks he might be exhausting his savings. Nacho breaks into Daniel Wormald's (Pryce) house and offers him $20,000 if he can obtain capsules that look like Hector's nitroglycerin, to which Daniel reluctantly agrees. Mike begins construction on the new playground for Stacey's church and reluctantly accepts some help from the other members of her support group, including Anita. Later as Mike heads to the parking attendant's booth to start his shift, he sees Daniel who tells him about Nacho's offer and asks Mike to be his bodyguard again. Mike refuses to get involved and advises Daniel that he should do the same. Kim attends a meeting with Paige at Mesa Verde's offices. When Paige praises Kim's cross- examination of Chuck at Jimmy's disciplinary hearing, which led to Chuck's meltdown on the witness stand, Kim expresses regret for having destroyed Chuck's reputation. At the support group, Mike befriends Anita after she recounts how her husband, a former Navy officer, mysteriously disappeared on a hiking trip. The story compels Mike to contact Daniel and agree to be his bodyguard. While having dinner with Jimmy, Kim briefly plays along with a grifting \\"game\\", but quickly makes sure he knows they're not going to actually do it. When Kim wonders whether they did the right thing with Chuck, an exasperated Jimmy replies what happened to Chuck was his own fault and she should forget about him. Mike and Daniel meet with Nacho, who tells Mike the full story— Hector wants to turn Nacho's father's upholstery shop into a front business for the Salamanca drug trade, so Nacho intends to kill Hector by switching his nitro for a placebo. Mike agrees not to interfere, but advises Nacho that if Hector dies, he should replace the fake pills with the real ones so that the cause of Hector's death won't be obvious. Because his law license is suspended, Jimmy tries to obtain a refund on his malpractice insurance policy. The agent is unable to comply because the insurance has to stay in effect so that he's covered if someone accuses him of past malpractice while his license is suspended. She also informs Jimmy that his premium will rise by 150% after he is reinstated. Jimmy appears shaken by the news and starts to cry, but then mentions Chuck's nervous breakdown at the bar hearing and apparent mental illness as the reason for his supposed distress. Jimmy leaves the insurance agent's office with a smirk of satisfaction, knowing he's caused serious trouble for Chuck. ==Reception== Ratings Upon airing, the episode received 1.65 million American viewers, and an 18–49 rating of 0.7.

In 1951, her parents divorced and in 1955, she moved to Great Neck, New York with her mother's new husband, Marc Germont. She attended elementary school in Great Neck and also took Hebrew classes at Temple Israel. She has one half- brother from her mother's second marriage, composer Bruce Wolosoff. Germont died of leukimia when Silverman was 12 and her mother married wealthy Long Island real estate developer Alvin Bibbs Wolosoff who she worked for as a secretary. In 1964, she attended the Howard School for Girls in Bridgewater, Massachusetts and then studied liberal arts at the University of Maryland from 1965 to 1968 but dropped out. She then went to work as a receptionist at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer in New York City. In 1986, she was named a member of New York City Mayor's Commission for Protocol under Ed Koch and also served chairman of the Advisory Council of the New York State Commission on the Bicentenial of the United States Constitution. In 1988, she worked for the New York presidential campaign of then-Vice President George H. W. Bush raising over $600,000 becoming one of his top fundraisers. She donated $100,000 to Bush's campaign and additional $300,000 to his various Republican candidates either in her name, her husband's name, or in the name of Ply Gem Building Products where her husband was CEO. After Bush's victory, Bush's brother, Jonathan Bush and Republican Party Chairman Richard N. Bond recommended her for an ambassadorship and she was nominated on June 29, 1989 as United States Ambassador to Barbados (which is also responsible for Dominica, Saint Lucia, and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines) despite her desire to be named Ambassador of Luxembourg. The nomination was controversial as she was one of several made by Bush of long-time financial backers and financial supporters rather than career Foreign Service officers including Republican bundler Peter F. Secchia (Ambassador of Italy), Walter Curley (Ambassador of France), real estate developer Joseph Zappala (Ambassador of Spain), and real estate developer Mel Sembler (Ambassador of Australia). Democratic Senator Paul Sarbanes shut down the nomination stating she is \\"a candidate with no ostensible qualifications for ambassadorship other than her campaign contributions\\" despite the rest of the non-career and all-male nominees being approved to more prestigious positions. The Wolosoff family attorney and in- law, Chief Judge of the New York Court of Appeals Sol Wachtler (Wachtler's wife was the niece of Alvin Bibbs Wolosoff) tried to intervene on her behalf with formal documentation of Silverman's campaign contributions but the nomination eventually expired in the U.S. Senate never coming to a vote. President Bush then appointed her as a trustee of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts. When Alvin Bibbs Wolosoff died in 1984, Wachtler served as executor of his $24 million estate and protected Silverman's $2.4 million inheritance from Wolosoff's son James who had been disinherited. In 1988, Silverman and Wachtler began to have an affair but the relationship soured in 1991 as Wachtler refused to leave his wife; Silverman then began dating attorney David Samson. Wachtler did not take her leaving him well and soon began harassing Silverman. Silverman directly contacted then FBI Director William Sessions who referred the case to the FBI field office in Newark. After a call to Silverman was traced to Wachtler, he was arrested on 7 November 1992, on charges including extortion, racketeering, and blackmail.Plotz, David. \\"Judicial Restraint: Sol Wachtler's worthy sentiments on prison.\\" Slate.com April 16, 1997 Prosecutors alleged that he demanded a $20,000 blackmail payment in exchange for turning over compromising photographs and tapes of Silverman with her then-boyfriend, attorney David Samson. He eventually pleaded guilty to harassing Silverman and threatening to kidnap her daughter. Wachtler resigned as a judge and from the bar; and was sentenced to 15 months, but received time off for good behavior. Silverman was besieged by the press and blamed for her role in the removal of the popular judge and left New York City. Silverman later became spokesperson for the National Victim Center. ==Personal life== In January 1969, she married her childhood friend and furniture store heir, Richard \\"Dick\\" Simons. The couple moved to Palm Beach, Florida and had one son, Evan Marc Simons (born 1970). In 1972, they divorced. She was introduced to her second husband, Florida banker David L.

After graduating, he founded the literary journal Osaka bungaku with Sakunosuke Oda. He won the Nakahara Chuya Prize in 1941 and the Bungei Panron Prize in 1943 for his poetry. His father's factory, however, burned down during World War II and Sugiyama had to give up his creative activities in order to rebuild the family business, an endeavor that ended in failure in 1956 when the company had to declare bankruptcy after a series of labor conflicts and natural disasters. It took him 24 years to publish his second book of poetry. His poetry has been termed \\"short and crisp, witty, more visual than musical, philosophical and even metaphysical – without losing touch with day-to-day reality.\\" He won the Gendai Shijin Award at age 97 in March 2012, two months before his death of pneumonia. It was said that Sugiyama \\"spent his life between cinema and poetry\\". His poetry revealed \\"the eye of a cinematographer\\" and his first book, published in 1941, was on film.

The newspaper therefore emphasizes news and topical matters, prioritizing political, business, and social journalism. Kanalen follows the Ethical Code of Practice for the Norwegian Press and distinguishes itself from the local newspaper tradition with a critical and socially oriented approach. The paper is a member of the National Association of Local Newspapers. ==Editors== * Jan Arve Andersen (2001–2006) * Jarle Aaheim (2006–2009) * Britt Eriksen (2009–2012) * Tor Espen Simonsen (February 2012–) ==Circulation== According to the Norwegian Audit Bureau of Circulations and the National Association of Local Newspapers, Kanalen has had the following annual circulation: *2004: 1,869 *2005: 2,130 *2006: 2,069 *2007: 2,020 *2008: 2,049 *2009: 1,909 *2010: 1,800 *2011: 1,744 *2012: 1,774 *2013: 1,845 *2014: 1,893 *2015: 1,959 *2016: 1,842Medienorge: Opplagstall norske aviser. ==ReferencesExternal links== *Kanalen home page Category:Newspapers published in Norway Category:Norwegian- language newspapers Category:Mass media in Telemark Category:Nome, Norway Category:Publications established in 2001 Category:2001 establishments in Norway ","title":"Kanalen"},{"id":"54123831","text":"Zilahy is a Hungarian surname that may refer to *Gyula Zilahy (1859–1938), Hungarian stage and film actor *Irène Zilahy (1904–1944), Hungarian actress *Lajos Zilahy (1891–1974), Hungarian novelist and playwright *Péter Zilahy (born 1970), Hungarian writer and performer Category:Hungarian-language surnames ","title":"Zilahy"},{"id":"54123834","text":"Dave Heeke is the athletic director at the University of Arizona. ==College== Heeke earned a bachelor's degree in 1985 from Albion College, where he was a member of the club hockey team and co-captain of the baseball team, then earning a master's degree from Ohio State University in 1987. ==Career== Heeke served 18 years at the University of Oregon, initially holding a role boosting the program's support in Portland.

The Kronotsky and Krasheninnikov volcanoes are visible between the lake and the Pacific coast to the right (southwest). North is at the upper left. Lake Kronotskoye () is a triangle-shaped lake located in Kamchatka Krai, Russia, north of the Valley of Geysers and away from the east coast of the Kamchatka Peninsula. It is named after the nearby volcano Kronotsky, part of the Eastern Range, whose name presumably derives from Itelmen krának, \\"high stone mountain.\\" It was formed about 10,000 years ago when lava and pyroclastic flows from eruptions of the Kronotsky and Krasheninnikov volcanoes dammed the Kronotskaya River. Lake Kronotskoye covers an area of and has an average depth of and a volume of . The lake drains an area of , with the Listvennichnaya, Unana and Uzon being the largest rivers to flow into it. The lake drains into Kronotskaya River in its southeast corner, which flows southeast into the Pacific Ocean. Lake Kronotskoye freezes over from late December to mid-May to a depth of one metre. It is a dimictic lake, reaching isothermy in July and late November. The water is cold even in summer, not exceeding even at its warmest in September. The pH at the surface decreases from 8.7 to 8.0 during the growing season. Massive rapids at the head of the Kronotskaya River prevent fish from entering or leaving the lake. Those that live in the lake are therefore of special scientific interest as model studies in microevolution processes. They comprise a population of landlocked sockeye or kokanee salmon and a group of char distinguished by its significant polymorphism and plasticity: researchers have identified between three and five different forms. There are 11 islands in the eastern side of the lake which cover a total area of around and host a colony of about 600 pairs of slaty-backed gulls. Lake Kronotskoye is also well known for its population of swans. The area surrounding the lake is uninhabited and protected as Kronotsky Nature Reserve, a component of the Volcanoes of Kamchatka World Heritage Site. The first Russians to reach the lake were the members of F.P. Ryabushinsky's Kamchatka expedition of 1908; the islands in the lake are named after them. ==References== Category:Lakes of Kamchatka Krai ","title":"Lake Kronotskoye"},{"id":"54123940","text":"A Welcome To Britain (retitled How To Behave In Britain) is a 1943 training film for the United States Armed Forces which was narrated (and co-written and co-directed) by Burgess Meredith and Anthony Asquith. The film explains to United States troops being deployed to Europe for the invasion of Normandy how they should act and behave in the United Kingdom. It demonstrates appropriate behaviour and depicts what is expected in given social situations. Though produced for American viewing, the film was produced by the UK's Ministry of Information through the Strand Film Company, which specialized in making documentaries in the 1930s and '40s. ==Plot== Race relations scene from Welcome to Britain The film focuses on the importance of respecting, or at least acknowledging, cultural differences between American personnel and British people in order to avoid unnecessary misunderstandings. Notable settings and situations in the film include British pubs, how to behave when invited to dinner, and the friendly relationship between the RAF and the USAAF. The film provides examples of how to interact with several varied groups of people: British children, strangers, prostitutes and military officers.https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1980031/http://player.bfi.org.uk/film/watch- a-welcome-to-britain-1943/http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b69f765cc American generals John C. H. Lee and Ira C. Eaker, actress Beatrice Lillie and comedian Bob Hope also appear in the film. The film also attempts to portray attitudes of racial prejudice in the UK, which were generally more tolerant than those in the United States at the time. The film refers to non-white soldiers as \\"coloured\\" and tries to explain why a British woman might invite a \\"coloured\\" soldier for tea. To alleviate potential concerns of impropriety, an elderly woman was chosen to portray the hostess in this tea scene rather than a young woman. ==Reception== The film was very well-received by British critics. A number of British newspapers called for its general release, though it was not released for viewing by the British public during the war. The Daily Mail said that it \\"should do more than any other stroke to create a genuine Anglo-American understanding\\". Polling of GI audiences also revealed very positive attitudes. ==ReferencesExternal links== Category:1943 films Category:Army education and training Category:1940s war films Category:1943 documentary films Category:American World War II propaganda films Category:British World War II propaganda films Category:British films Category:American films Category:American documentary films Category:American black-and-white films ","title":"A Welcome to Britain"},{"id":"54124033","text":"The 1927 Middle Tennessee Blue Raiders football team represented the Middle Tennessee State University during the 1927 NCAA football season.

The Ash'aris are a doctrinal school of thought named after Imam Abu al-Hasan al-Ash'ari, and the Maturidi school is named for Abu Mansur al-Maturidi. These two schools are essentially one. However, they differ in terms of about forty matters. These differences, however, consist only matters of detail. Both Imam al-Ash'ari and Imam al- Maturidi were Sunni Muslims who lived during the time of the first three centuries after the time of the Prophetic revelation. In Sunni Islam it is understood that the earliest scholars held the most weight with terms to encapsulating the religion as was intended by Prophet Muhammad. Both of them defended and upheld the transmitted beliefs of the Qur'an and Sunnah, as understood by mainstream Sunni Islam in each generation before them, from the extremes of excessive literalism. Their teachings and methodology were accepted as the standard of mainstream Sunni Islam by clear general consensus of the scholarly community in their own times and in every generation since. The Malikis and Shafi'is, on the whole, became Ash'aris in theology, while a significant section of the Hanafis became Maturidis (who in many respects are similar to Ash'aris). == Ash'aris == Ash'aris are those who adhere to Imam Abu al-Hasan al-Ash'ari in his school of theology. Ibn 'Abd al-Salam said: \\"Agreement has formed in subscribing to al-Ash'ari's doctrine among the Shafi'is, the Malikis, the Hanafis, and the nobility of the Hanbalis.\\" His statement was endorsed in his time by the Maliki authority Abu 'Amr ibn al- Hajib and by the Shaykh of the Hanafis Jamal al-Din al-Hasiri. The Maliki imam Abu 'Abd Allah Muhammad ibn Musa al-Mayurqi said: \\"The Ahl al-Sunna among the Malikis, the Shafi'is, and the majority of the Hanafis speak with the tongue of Abu al-Hasan al-Ash'ari and argue by his arguments.\\" Taj al-Din al-Subki quoted it and went on to say: \\"We do not know any Malikis except they are Ash'aris.\\" There are some rare exceptions, such as Ibn 'Abd al-Barr and Abu 'Umar al-Talamnaki. As for Ibn Abi Zayd al-Qayrawani (310-386), he belonged to the Ash'ari school which he took, among others, from Abu Bakr ibn 'Abd al- Mu'min the student of Ibn Mujahid the student of Abu al-Hasan al-Ash'ari. Al- Qadi 'Iyad mentioned that in the year 368 Ibn Abi Zayd sent two of his students to deliver some of his books by hand to Ibn Mujahid who had requested them, with a full license to narrate them from him (ijaza). Ibn Abi Zayd notably defended the Ash'ari school in his epistle entitled \\"Al-Radd 'ala al- Qadariyya wa Munaqadat Risalet al-Baghdadi al-Mu'tazili,\\" a refutation of the attacks of the Mu'tazili 'Ali ibn Isma'il al-Baghdadi. Al-Mayurqi further narrated that Ibn Abi Zayd said: \\"Al-Ash'ari is a man famous for refuting the people of Innovation, the Qadariyya and the Jahmiyya, and he held fast to the Sunan.\\" Ibn 'Asakir in \\"Tabyin Kadhib al-Muftari fima Nusiba ila al-Imam Abi al-Hasan al-Ash'ari\\" () and Taj al-Din al-Subki in \\"Tabaqat al-Shafi'iyya al- Kubra\\" () listed the most illustrious figures of the Ash'ari scholars, starting with the biographical layer of al-Ash'ari himself.

His first murder trial ended with a stay of proceedings in April 1998 after the trial judge ruled that certain statements, because police had violated his Charter rights, could not be heard by the jury. In April 1998 lawyers revealed that a tape of Mr. Mentuck's police interrogation had been doctored, causing Mr Justice John A. Menzies of the Court of Queen's Bench of Manitoba to issue the stay. The conduct of the RCMP was questioned by the defence in the second trial because of the procedure that was employed to obtain Mentuck's confession, now known as Mr. Big (police procedure). After the first trial had ended in a hung jury, Mentuck denied the murder was his at least a dozen times to an undercover officer (aka \\"Mr Big\\") but he finally caved and confessed, after significant verbal pressure and financial subsidy from Mr Big. The judge ruled that the confession be excluded because the level of inducement diminished the reliability of the testimony.Peter Van Sant, Jenna Jackson: \\"Perfectly Executed\\". Simon&Schuster;, 2007. p.133-134nationalpost.com: \\"\\", 1 Aug 2014 Because the jury could not convict him in his second trial, the judge declared a mistrial. A third trial was scheduled a few months later.cbc.ca: \\"Murder trial ends in mistrial\\", 18 Feb 2000 For the third trial, Mentuck elected to be tried by judge alone. He was exonerated and wished for his ordeal, and in particular the tactics used in his case by the RCMP to elicit a confession, to be known by the public at large but was prevented by a publication ban. Mentuck appealed the ban to the Supreme Court of Canada. Unlike most cases this case did not come up through an appeal court. Contemporary law prevents intermediate courts from judging publication bans, making the only avenue for such challenges the Supreme Court.Ottawa Citizen: \\"Court scraps publication bans\\", 15 Nov 2001. Mr. Justice Alan MacInnes called the technique \\"bizarre\\". G+M: \\"Gag order obscures man's innocence\\", 23 Oct 2000 Said Jonathan Kroft, a lawyer fighting the ban on behalf of The Winnipeg Free Press and Thomson Newspapers Ltd: Justice Iacobucci wrote for a unanimous Supreme Court a judgment that supported # a publication ban for one year but no more as to the identity of police officers who arrested Mentuck, and # refusing a ban as to operational methods. That is, the operational methods were forthwith subject to disclosure. The ban ordered by the trial judge was properly issued and was of the appropriate scope in light of the requirements of the Charter. A three-pronged analysis introduced here by the court required the consideration of the necessity of the ban in relation to its object of protecting the proper administration of justice. The appeal was from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench of Manitoba. The particular trial dealt with a second-degree murder suspect. The suspect was subject to three trials, at the end of which he was acquitted. In the interval, Mentuck spent 20 months in jail. This case is important because it shows that the revelation of the operational methods of police is no bar to publication. A protocol has arisen in Canadian law to determine whether a publication ban can be justified; this protocol is now known as the Dagenais/Mentuck test. The Mentuck case has become infamous, as the Mr Big procedure has become viewed by the courts as \\"ingenious, not insidious\\". One author, writing in 2007, even says that the technique is \\"indiscriminate and pernicious\\".nowtoronto.com: \\"You can call me Mr. Big\\", 22 Feb 2007Kouri T.

The hangings at Battleford refers to the execution on November 27, 1885 of eight Indigenous men for their role in the North-West Rebellion. They are similar to the largest mass execution in the United States, following the Dakota War of 1862. The executions followed the Frog Lake Massacre, the North-West Resistance, and the Looting of Battleford. Prior to the North-West Resistance the Canadian Government's actions in what would become Saskatchewan resulted in starvation, disease, and death among the Indigenous peoples of the area. Traditional means of self-support, such as buffalo disappeared with the sale of lands. At both Frog Lake and Battleford, some people took up arms against the wishes of their leaders. Some faced trial and jail or sentence of death. Others fled to the United States. == Trial and charges of bias against Stipendiary Magistrate (Judge) Charles Rouleau == The Frog Lake Massacre saw Indian Agent Thomas Trueman Quinn initially shot in the head. Quinn was a notoriously harsh Indian Agent, who kept Indigenous people near Frog Lake on the brink of starvation (\\"no work, no rations\\"). Quinn treated the Cree with harshness and arrogance.(citation to Sask Encyclopedia) Before dawn on April 2, 1885, a party of Cree warriors captured Quinn at his home. He refused to go to another location with the Cree warriors and was shot dead onsite. In the moments of panic following Quinn's shooting, eight other settler prisoners were shot dead. Following the resistance at Frog Lake, the participants were taken to Battleford. Wandering Spirit pleaded guilty and was sentenced to hang on September 22, 1885. The major trial condemning six of the eight men to death by hanging was heard by Battleford \\"Resident Stipendiary Magistrate\\" (Judge) Charles Rouleau. He was described as a \\"heavy loser pecuniarily\\" after the Looting of Battleford in the December issue of the Saskatchewan Herald following the hangings - in reality, his house had been burned to the ground, and he reportedly threatened that \\"every Indian and Half-breed and rebel brought before him after the insurrection was suppressed, would be sent to the gallows if possible.\\" The Cree-speaking men who were sentenced to hang were not provided with translation at their trial. == People sentenced to death at Battleford == The following people were sentenced to die in Battleford. The first six names relate to murders which occurred at the Frog Lake Massacre, while the final two relate to murders which occurred during Looting of Battleford. # Kah - Paypamahchukways (Wandering Spirit) for the murder of T. T. Quinn, Indian Agent. # Pah Pah-Me-Kee-Sick (Walking the Sky) for the murder of Léon Fafard O.M.I., a Roman Catholic priest. # Manchoose ( Bad Arrow) for the murder of Charles Govin, Quinn's interpreter. # Kit-Ahwah-Ke-Ni (Miserable Man) for the murder of Govin. # Nahpase (Iron Body) for the murder of George Dill, Free Trader. # A-Pis-Chas-Koos (Little Bear) for the murder of Dill. # Itka (Crooked Leg) for the murder of Payne, Farm Instructor of the Stoney Reserve south of Battleford. # Waywahnitch (Man Without Blood) for the murder of Tremont, Rancher out of Battleford. == The hangings == There are a number of first-hand historical records that exist of the Hangings at Battleford, however the majority of accounts are written from the perspective of settlers in the area. Blood Red the Sun, a work by William Bleasdell Cameron, first published in 1926 as The War Trail of Big Bear, describes the events leading up to the Frog Lake Massacre and the executions in significant detail - albeit from the perspective of someone whose friends and colleagues were killed at the Frog Lake Massacre. Cameron was an HBC employee whose life was spared by Wandering Spirit. Cameron testified at the trials against the accused men. == Presence of children from Battleford Residential School == A number of sources indicate that children from Battleford Industrial School were brought from the school to witness the hangings as a \\"warning\\". == Historical significance == The hangings at Battleford are an example of British colonialism and subjugation of Indigenous peoples in what would become the Canadian prairie provinces two decades later. In his seminal 1970s-era histographical account of Indian policy in Canada, Prisons of Grass, Howard Adams points to the significance of the hangings at Battleford: \\"Every member of the Indian nation heard the death-rattle of the eight heroes who died at the end of the colonizers rope and they went quietly back to their compounds, obediently submitting themselves to the oppressors. The eight men who sacrificed their lives at the end of the rope were the champions of freedom and democracy. They were incomparable heroes, as shown by their last moments.\\" == Rediscovery of the gravesite == A headstone placed at the mass grave of the Battleford Eight. After the hangings, the bodies were placed in a mass grave near the fort. It remained hidden for many years. In 1972, the gravesite was rediscovered by students who followed old plans of the fort in order to find the burial location.(citation to Sask Indian article). The location was marked with a cement pad and chain fence. In later years, this was removed and replaced with a modern headstone bearing the names of the executed men. There is also an interpretive panel explaining the history of the burial site. The gravesite is located on public property in the Town of Battleford at near the Eiling Kramer Campground and Fort Battleford. ==References== ","title":"1885 hangings at Battleford"},{"id":"54124200","text":"Gordon Stanley Trenouth (November 3, 1886 – June 8, 1956Hockey deaths - June 1956) was a Canadian professional ice hockey player.

Erected from 1892 to 1893, the Queen Anne style structure was built for Charles Body, owner of a local wallpaper store. It underwent a major renovation from 1994 to 1995, and was added to the National Register of Historic Places on September 18, 1998. ==History of the building== The Body Block began construction in 1892, and was completed in 1893. The building was commissioned and owned by Charles Body, a local businessman who owned a wallpaper store. Although it is not known for certain, the architect was likely George H. Smith, a local architect of note who designed the 1888 Cleveland Arcade. Located at the intersection of Payne Avenue and E. 55th Street in the Goodrich–Kirtland Park neighborhood, the three-story structure has a frontage on Payne Avenue and a frontage on E. 55th Street. The structure was built of brick with a wood frame, with the interior walls coated with asbestos and mineral wool for fireproofing. The building's ground floor contained space for roughly 10 retail stores, while the upper two floors contained 44 apartments. An arcade ran through the center of the building, lit from above by a skylight with glass. Walkways connected the two sides of the building on the second floor. The total cost of the structure was $30,000 ($ in dollars). Known as the Body Block and as the Charles Body Block, the building was also referred to as the \\"Old Smith Arcade\\" due to its resemblance to Smith's Cleveland Arcade. Goodrich-Kirtland Park was largely a rural area when annexed by the city of Cleveland in 1850. It began to urbanize in the 1870s and 1880s,; and the Body Block was constructed in the middle of the 20-year period that marked the neighborhood's swiftest growth and height (in terms of population). Located at the intersection of two major thoroughfares, it catered to middle class individuals and families and made a significant contribution to the retail and residential life of the area. The Body Block suffered a severe fire on January 30, 1897, when chemicals in the basement of a ground-floor pharmacy spontaneously combusted. The major three- alarm fire caused $4,000 ($ in dollars) in damages, but no one was injured or killed. The Goodrich–Kirtland Park area began to lose housing after 1920 as it increasingly industrialized. During Prohibition, criminals being chased by the police would flee into the area to evade them, giving the neighborhood as reputation has a haven for crime. The Body Block lost its middle-class respectability, and became home to less wealthy working class families and widows. From 1920 to 1950, the area's population stayed roughly steady at about 65,000 people. It was a diverse area which included immigrants from Eastern Europe and Jews, and there was a substantial African American population since landlords in Goodrich-Kirtland Park were among the few in the city who would rent to blacks. The neighborhood was economically well- developed, with several retail shopping districts, movie theaters, and restaurants. After 1950, the neighborhood became overwhelmingly black and poor, as African Americans leaving the Deep South came to Cleveland looking for work during the Second Great Migration. What few residential areas remained in Goodrich–Kirtland Park became heavily overcrowded. The crack cocaine epidemic of the 1980s drove large numbers of people out of the neighborhood, and the population fell to just 13,000. as crack moved in, working-class blacks moved farther east, and block after block of homes and businesses were demolished in the name of urban renewal. Several blocks of buildings were abandoned, while others were demolished. Business fled the area, city services such as trash pick-up and street maintenance became irregular, illegal dumping became common, and the police presence was poor. The building's decline continued into the early 1990s, by which time it was primarily empty and decrepit. Homeless individuals used it as a refuge, and extensive drug trafficking occurred there. 1994-1995 renovation In 1991, the Nouvelle Espoir Development Corp. purchased the Body Block with the intention of renovating it. The company received a 10-year, $210,000 ($ in dollars) federal low-income housing tax credit in 1992. The following year, the company received a 30-year, $466,000 ($ in dollars) state historic tax credit; a $300,000 ($ in dollars) loan from the Cleveland Housing Trust Fund; a $400,000 ($ in dollars) loan from the Ohio Housing Trust Fund; and a $50,000 ($ in dollars) grant from the Cleveland weatherization fund. In 1994, 11 banks agreed to lend the remaining $1.5 million ($ in dollars) needed for the $2.8 million ($ in dollars) renovation project. The restoration and renovation of the Body Block left it with 49 one- and two-bedroom apartments on the second and third floors, and retail space on the first floor. All units were available for rent only to low-income individuals and families who were participating in employment programs run by the city. Construction began in April 1994, and was set for completion in February 1995. Zelina-Sandvick Architects designed the renovation, which completely overhauled the building's electrical, heating, and plumbing systems and added a playground to the rear of the building. In April 2017, the building was purchased by real estate company Smartland11, LLC, the latter of which has its headquarters based in Cleveland. ==ReferencesExternal links== Category:Goodrich-Kirtland Park Category:National Register of Historic Places in Cleveland, Ohio Category:Buildings and structures in Cleveland Category:Commercial buildings on the National Register of Historic Places in Ohio Category:Residential buildings on the National Register of Historic Places in Ohio Category:Commercial buildings completed in 1893 Category:Residential buildings completed in 1893 Category:Queen Anne architecture in Ohio ","title":"Body Block"},{"id":"54124220","text":"Christine Pellegrino is a former member of the New York State Assembly from the 9th District.

He was a personal outside attorney for U.S. President Donald Trump. On May 24, 2017, Kasowitz was retained to represent Trump personally in connection with investigations into the role of Trump's presidential campaign in Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections. He later resigned on July 20, 2017. Kasowitz also represents several Russian clients with close ties to Vladimir Putin. ==Early life and education== Kasowitz was born in New Haven, Connecticut, to Robert (1923–2015) and Felice (née Molaver; 1930–2004) Kasowitz. He has a fraternal twin brother, Stephen, and a younger sister, Susan. His family is Jewish. His father, Robert, ran a scrap metal business. Marc's paternal grandparents, Samuel and Rose Kasowitz, emigrated from Poland to Connecticut, where Samuel started the scrap business with a push cart. Robert and his brothers Milton and Harold helped grow it into a family business. On his mother's side of the family, his grandfather William Molaver also emigrated from Poland, and his grandmother's parents came from Russia. He attended Hopkins Grammar School in New Haven. He graduated from Yale University with a B.A. in American history and from Cornell Law School with a J.D. ==Career== Kasowitz worked for the law firm Mayer Brown until 1993, when Kasowitz, 18 other lawyers, and two clients left Mayer Brown to establish the Kasowitz Benson Torres law firm. After the 1993 World Trade Center bombing, Kasowitz defended the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey in a lawsuit filed by victims of the attack. In 2005, the Port Authority was ruled to be negligent. He has also defended Bill O'Reilly from allegations of sexual harassment, who was ultimately forced out at Fox News in April 2017. Donald Trump According to a May 23, 2017 article in Forward, Kasowitz, Benson, Torres, and Friedman has been a \\"go-to source\\" for Donald Trump for decades. He has represented Donald Trump in his divorce proceedings, bankruptcy cases, Trump University lawsuits, during the 2016 presidential campaign regarding sexual misconduct allegations, and during the Trump presidency in the investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections. In Spring 2017, Kasowitz told associates that he had been personally responsible for the abrupt dismissal of U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara on March 11, 2017, having previously warned Trump, \\"This guy is going to get you\\". Kasowitz departed Trump's White House legal team on July 20, 2017. Kasowitz currently represents Trump's medical adviser Scott Atlas, and threatened to sue many Stanford University-affiliated doctors and researchers who signed a letter criticizing Atlas Russian clients According to U.S. court records, Kasowitz's clients include the Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska, a close associate of Vladimir Putin and a business partner of Trump's former campaign manager Paul Manafort. Kasowitz also represents the Russian state-owned bank Sberbank, a bank under sanctions by the EU and the United States after Russia's 2014 annexation of Ukraine's Crimea region. ==2017 threats against emailer== In 2017, ProPublica reported that Kasowitz may be ineligible for a federal security clearance due to his alcohol abuse. After reading the articles, a currently unidentified individual sent an email to Kasowitz urging him to \\"resign now.\\" Kasowitz replied with a series of profanity-laced emails, some of which took a threatening tone, writing, \\"I'm on you now. You are fucking with me now Let's see who you are Watch your back, bitch,\\" as well as \\"Call me. Don't be afraid, you piece of shit. Stand up. If you don't call, you're just afraid.\\" And later: \\"I already know where you live, I'm on you. You might as well call me. You will see me. I promise. Bro.\\" The emailer forwarded the emails to the Federal Bureau of Investigation to report the threats, and Kasowitz subsequently issued a statement saying \\"The person sending that email is entitled to his opinion, and I should not have responded in that inappropriate manner...This is one of those times where one wishes he could reverse the clock, but of course I can't.\\" ==Personal life== Kasowitz is married to Lori Kasowitz, whom he met while she was working as a manager at Mayer Brown. In 2001, they created the Marc E. and Lori A. Kasowitz Scholarship at Cornell Law School. In 2007, they pledged an additional $250,000 to the law school's endowment. He and his twin brother, Stephen, also established a scholarship at Hopkins Grammar School, which they attended growing up. In recent years, Marc and Lori Kasowitz have donated hundreds of thousands of dollars to Republican causes and to Donald Trump's presidential campaign. They have also donated to Democratic politicians in the past, including President Barack Obama, Vice President Joe Biden, and Senators Chuck Schumer, and Harry Reid. ==ReferencesExternal links== *Profile at kasowitz.com * Category:1952 births Category:Living people Category:Lawyers from New York City Category:Yale College alumni Category:Cornell Law School alumni Category:Lawyers from New Haven, Connecticut Category:Twin people from the United States Category:Jewish American attorneys Category:American people of Polish-Jewish descent Category:American people of Russian-Jewish descent Category:Kasowitz Benson Torres people ","title":"Marc Kasowitz"},{"id":"54124264","text":"Theris M.

Rostenowski later backed him for an appointment to Alderman for the 32nd ward after Robert Sulski became a judge on the Circuit Court of Cook County. He took office the same day as Edward M. Burke. During the Council Wars he sided with the all-white Vrdolyak 29 in opposition of Mayor Harold Washington. In 1988, he was appointed Democratic Committeeman for the ward; succeeding his mentor Rostenkowski. In the 1987 election when Washington took a majority on the council, he defeated Washington-ally Emma Lozano Rico, the sister of labor activist Rudy Lozano, with 75% of the vote. From 1988 until 1998, Gabinski was the city's Vice Mayor. Gabinski was elected Vice Mayor by the Chicago City Council after they voted to oust David Orr over his attempts to make reforms that would have held the council's committees more accountable for the budgets they manage.

With lineage tracing back to 1866, it is the oldest National Guard artillery unit west of the Mississippi River continually serving. Today, its 2nd Battalion (2-218th Field Artillery) is a part of the 41st Infantry Brigade Combat Team and is currently headquartered in Forest Grove, Oregon. ==Current Structure== *50px 2nd Battalion, 218th Field Artillery Regiment **Headquarters and Headquarters Battery Forest Grove **Battery A, Portland **Battery B, McMinnville **Battery C, Portland **F Forward Support Company, 141st Brigade Support Battalion, Forest Grove ==Early history== The 218th Field Artillery Regiment traces its lineage to the Portland Light Battery, a militia unit founded by Portland volunteers in 1866, immediately after the American Civil War. However, the status of militia units declined as the citizens didn't consider a well-armed and disciplined reserve force necessary anymore. By 1872, the Portland Light Battery and three infantry companies were all that remained of the Oregon militia. During the Bannock War in 1878, the battery was mobilized to defend northeastern Oregon, but it never saw action and the Indians surrendered by September of that year. The Bannock War did, however, convince Oregonians of the need of skilled reserve forces, and new units were formed and the old ones were revamped. Membership in these militia organizations was more fraternal than military. For example, the published by-laws of the Portland Light Battery stated that \\"new members shall be voted upon by the membership and if three nay votes are counted, the man will not be accepted.\\" Dues of fifty cents per month were charged to enable a member to buy his own equipment. Centralized control and military standardization within the State was nonexistent. During the late Nineteenth Century, the National Guard underwent serious reorganization and expansion. In 1916, Battery A of the artillery was sent to the Mexico–United States border for federal service defending against cross-border raids by Pancho Villa. While the unit did not see combat, it underwent valuable training. In 1917, The Oregon Field Artillery helped form the 147th Field Artillery Regiment. The 147th served with the 32nd Infantry Division during World War I. The 218th claims heritage from the 147th, thus the symbol of the 32nd Division is on its coat of arms. In 1921, the Ninth Corps Area in the Western U.S. was given the 41st Infantry Division, and Oregon filled the unit's 82nd Brigade with the 162nd Infantry Regiment, the 186th Infantry Regiment, and the newly formed 218th Field Artillery Regiment. ==World War II== In 1941, the 218th Field Artillery was ordered to head to the Philippines to guard against possible Japanese attack. When the Attack on Pearl Harbor occurred, the 218th was at sea, and was immediately rerouted back to Oregon. America had entered World War II, and the 41st Infantry Division was sent to the Pacific War to fight against the Empire of Japan. In the summer of 1943, the 162nd Infantry Regiment alongside a Brigade of Australian troops assaulted Nassau Bay on the north coast of New Guinea in order to drive the Japanese out of Salamaua. The landings were disastrous, and heavy surf swamped may landing craft. The infantry struggled to get ashore, and the invasion was soon called \\"shipwreck landing.\\" The 218th Field Artillery Battalion was slated to follow the 162nd Infantry in, but not enough boats were available anymore, so B and C Batteries landed several days later. Japanese snipers, booby traps, and jungle ambushes greeted the artillerymen starting the first day, and the constant rain broken by periods of intense steamy heat marked a difficult campaign ahead. The 80 men of C Battery hauled their 4 M116 howitzers through 5 miles of jungle by hand, and were forced to cross and recross rivers in the twisting terrain. Despite the difficulties of moving howitzers through the jungle, the men were dug in on 8 July 1943, six thousand yards from a Japanese controlled hill called, \\"the Pimple.\\" On 8 July, the men of C Battery gathered to sign their names on the first shell to be fired by the 218th in combat in World War II. For several days, the 218th shelled the Pimple and its Japanese defenders in support of the US and Australian infantry assaults. The men were forced to hand carry the heavy shells hundreds of yards from the beach in order to resupply the howitzers. Some ammunition was air-dropped but most rounds were destroyed or damaged on impact. The 218th's NCOs organized working parties to sift through the damaged shells and salvage what primers and projectiles they could from the dented casings. On 10 July, C Battery fired in support of Australian assault and managed to destroy an entire Japanese company with nine high-explosive shells fired in thirty-six seconds. The enemy company had stopped for a rest while marching, and made a perfect target for the 75mm howitzers; at least 50 were killed and many more were wounded. The Australians took the Pimple the next day. As the New Guinea Campaign continued, the 218th Field Artillery supported infantry assaults on countless ridges and enemy strongpoints. On 4 August, the unit suffered its first combat fatalities when an Australian mortar round fell short and killed a forward observer team of five men. On 1 September, as the Battle of Salamaua was nearing its conclusion, the Japanese counterattacked. Dawn Company, 15th Brigade, Australian Army was cut off on a steep jungle ridge, and was low on ammunition. Captain Burelbach, the 218th's FSO (Fire Support Officer) attached to Dawn Company expertly called for fire on the attackers, and all the 218th's guns opened fire, driving the Japanese back, and rescuing Dawn Company. Japanese Marines took up the assault the next day, and the beleaguered Australians seemed on the verge of collapse. CPT Burelbah again called for the 218th to support, and the Japanese were once again thrown back. Later in the day, Dawn Company's CO, Captain Provan, hobbled into the 218th perimeter to thank the Oregon artillerymen who saved the lives of his men. The 218th would go on to serve in the Philippines Campaign from 1944–1945, and returned home when the war ended. The 41st Infantry Division was deactivated in 1946. ==War on Terror== The Second Battalion of the Regiment continues to exist as a part of the 41st Infantry Brigade Combat Team. During the Global War on Terror, the role of the artillery somewhat changed, and the 2-218th has been called upon to serve in multiple duties other than conventional artillery. Several volunteers from the Battalion agreed to serve in infantry companies during the Iraq War (OIF II), including Forward Observer Patrick Eldred. Serving with B Co, 2-162 Infantry, Eldred called for close artillery and air support over the course of 16 days of desperate fighting during the Battle of Najaf in 2004. The 2-218th Field Artillery was again called to serve in Iraq from July 2009-April 2010. They served as a route security force and escorted more than 13,000 trucks in hostile environments as US forces began withdrawing from Iraq. For their service in a role not usually suited for an artillery unit, the battalion earned the Meritorious Unit Commendation. ==References== Category:Forest Grove, Oregon Category:Military units and formations in Oregon Category:Field artillery regiments of the United States Army Category:Field artillery regiments of the United States Army National Guard Category:Military units and formations established in 1866 ","title":"218th Field Artillery Regiment (United States)"},{"id":"54125020","text":"The 1940 Ole Miss Rebels football team represented the University of Mississippi in the 1940 college football season.

One of the more dramatic points of the team's draft prowess came nights before the draft began, where Jackson said he was looking to offer star player Kristaps Porziņģis (who was feeling very discouraged about the direction the team was taking around this time) to either the Phoenix Suns or Boston Celtics in exchange for the opportunity to also draft coveted small forward Josh Jackson.http://www.espn.com/blog/new-york-knicks/post/_/id/66584/sources- knicks-offered-joakim-noah-in-kristaps-porzingis-trade-talks Rumors of Jackson also trying to obtain point guard Lonzo Ball from the Los Angeles Lakers would also crop up months after the draft concluded.http://bleacherreport.com/articles/2726995-kristaps-porzingis-trade- for-lonzo-ball-reportedly-wanted-by-phil-jackson However, after the Knicks ultimately failed to gain another draft pick to join their own first round selection, they would stick around with Kristaps and the three selections they still had back when their previous season concluded. For their only first round pick, the Knicks would select the French/Belgian point guard Frank Ntilikina, who last played for the SIG Strasbourg in France's LNB Pro A. As for their two-second round draft picks (the first being acquired from Chicago and the second from Houston), New York would use them on senior shooting guard Damyean Dotson from the University of Houston and Serbian point guard Ognjen Jaramaz from the Mega Leks. After the failed attempt to trade their star center, Jackson would ultimately be terminated from his position on June 28, 2017.https://www.sbnation.com/2017/6/28/15886050/kristaps-porzingis-phil- jackson-new-york-fired-nba-trade-rumors ==RosterStandings== Division Conference ==Game log==  Preseason  - ffcccc  1  October 3  Brooklyn   Hardaway Jr., Kanter (17)  Beasley, Hernangomez (10)  Ramon Sessions (5)  Madison Square Garden 14,981  0–1 - ffcccc  2  October 6  @ Washington   Enes Kanter (16)  Michael Beasley (8)  Jack, Sessions (5)  Capital One Arena 11,899  0–2 - ffcccc  3  October 8  @ Brooklyn   Willy Hernangomez (17)  Willy Hernangomez (12)  Jarrett Jack (5)  Barclays Center 14,161  0–3 - ffcccc  4  October 9  Houston   Tim Hardaway Jr. (21)  Enes Kanter (8)  Baker, Quinn (4)  Madison Square Garden N/A  0–4 - ffcccc  5  October 13  Washington   Tim Hardaway Jr. (23)  Enes Kanter, Kyle O'Quinn (7)  Ron Baker (5)  Madison Square Garden 17,461  0–5  Regular season  - fcc;\\"  1  October 19  @ Oklahoma   Kristaps Porzingis (31)  Kristaps Porzingis (12)  Baker, McDermott (4)  Chesapeake Energy Arena 18,203  0–1 - fcc;\\"  2  October 21  Detroit   Kristaps Porzingis (33)  Enes Kanter (10)  Baker, Sessions (5)  Madison Square Garden 19,812  0–2 - fcc;\\"  3  October 24  @ Boston   Enes Kanter (16)  Enes Kanter (19)  Ramon Sessions (7)  TD Garden 18,624  0–3 - cfc;\\"  4  October 27  Brooklyn   Kristaps Porzingis (30)  Kristaps Porzingis (9)  Jack, Ntilikina (5)  Madison Square Garden 19,812  1–3 - cfc;\\"  5  October 29  @ Cleveland   Tim Hardaway Jr. (34)  Kanter, Porzingis (12)  Jarrett Jack (9)  Quicken Loans Arena 20,562  2–3 - cfc;\\"  6  October 30  Denver   Kristaps Porzingis (38)  Enes Kanter (9)  Jarrett Jack (10)  Madison Square Garden 19,812  3–3 - fcc;\\"  7  November 1  Houston   Tim Hardaway Jr. (23)  Hardaway Jr., Thomas (7)  Frank Ntilikina (8)  Madison Square Garden 18,320  3–4 - cfc;\\"  8  November 3  Phoenix   Kristaps Porzingis (37)  Enes Kanter (15)  Jarrett Jack (8)  Madison Square Garden 19,404  4–4 - cfc;\\"  9  November 5  Indiana   Kristaps Porzingis (40)  Enes Kanter (18)  Frank Ntilikina (7)  Madison Square Garden 17,889  5–4 - cfc;\\"  10  November 7  Charlotte   Kristaps Porzingis (28)  Enes Kanter(6)  Courtney Lee (9)  Madison Square Garden 18,704  6–4 - fcc;\\"  11  November 8  @ Orlando   Tim Hardaway Jr. (26)  Tim Hardaway Jr. (11)  Frank Ntilikina (9)  Amway Center 18,500  6–5 - cfc;\\"  12  November 11  Sacramento   Kristaps Porzingis (34)  Enes Kanter (13)  Jarrett Jack (6)  Madison Square Garden 19,812  7–5 - fcc;\\"  13  November 13  Cleveland   Tim Hardaway Jr. (28)  Enes Kanter (16)  Hardaway Jr., Jack (5)  Madison Square Garden 19,812  7–6 - cfc;\\"  14  November 15  Utah   Tim Hardaway Jr. (26)  Kristaps Porzingis (8)  Jarrett Jack (5)  Madison Square Garden 18,695  8–6 - fcc;\\"  15  November 17  @ Toronto   Hardaway Jr., Porzingis (13)  Michael Beasley (7)  Jarrett Jack (7)  Air Canada Centre 19,800  8–7 - cfc;\\"  16  November 20  L.A.

In 1974, elections were held for the Mayor of Wellington plus other local government positions including eighteen city councillors. The polling was conducted using the standard first-past-the-post electoral method. ==Background== The 1974 election was famous for its close result. With a provisional majority that was small enough to be potentially eroded by special votes the final result was not known for nearly a month following several re-counts due to the closeness of the polling. Michael Fowler had an election night lead of 387 while over 4,000 special votes were cast which ended up being very evenly distributed between the two top contenders. In the end Fowlers majority was reduced by only 20 votes and he was duly declared elected as Wellington's new mayor. Sir Frank Kitts lost the Mayoralty after a record 18 years in the role, though he was still re-elected to the Wellington Harbour Board. The election saw the entry of the environmentalist Values Party into civic politics in Wellington, making it the second nationwide political party to participate in local elections. The Values Party did better than expected with party founder Tony Brunt elected to the council, the first successful third party candidate in Wellington history. Brunt also stood for Mayor with his candidacy drawing away many left-wing voters from the Labour Party. Outgoing Mayor Frank Kitts was to blame the Values vote for his defeat. ==Mayoralty resultsCouncillor results== Table footnotes: ==ReferencesExternal links== *Cartoon satirizing the closeness of the result Category:Mayoral elections in Wellington Category:1974 elections in New Zealand Category:Politics of the Wellington Region Category:October 1974 events in Oceania ","title":"1974 Wellington City mayoral election"},{"id":"54128104","text":"The 2017–18 Hertha BSC season is the 126th season in the football club's history and 5th consecutive and 35th overall season in the top flight of German football, the Bundesliga, having been promoted from the 2.

In his early career, Katzman played primarily in big band settings. Arriving in New York in the late 40's, he played in the big bands of Gene Krupa and Claude Thornhill, Sam Donahue, Buddy Rich, Jimmy Dorsey, and Benny Goodman. In 1956 he relocated to California, where he was invited to join the Stan Kenton band as a jazz soloist, both on recordings and on worldwide tours.

The Declaration was acclaimed at the 8th European Conference on Sustainable Cities & Towns from 27–29 April 2016 in Basque Country. The document can be seen as a continuation of the Aalborg Charter (1994) and the Aalborg Commitments (2004) echoing sustainability vision from Local Agenda 21, and is itself a call for active engagement from civil society. The vision of the Declaration is 'to create productive, sustainable and resilient cities for a liveable and inclusive Europe' The Basque Declaration is targeted at city leaders in Europe, including mayors and city governments, and can also be signed by individuals. It outlines pathways to help city leaders shape the development of their own municipalities, and ultimately aims to accelerate socio-cultural, socio- economic and technological transformation. The Declaration is based on the understanding that a diversity of local initiatives are required to address social, environmental and economic challenges. It recognises the importance of things such as protecting biodiversity, decarbonising energy systems, creating more sustainable mobility systems, protecting water systems, adapting to climate change, promoting social inclusion and strengthening local economies, among other things. Although focusing on action at the local scale, the Declaration is underpinned by the idea of cooperation, sharing and replication of solutions adapted to the local context. A strong theme of the Declaration is to have a highly engaged civil society, where participation is a key ingredient in both developing and implementing local transformative actions. The 15 pathways listed in the Basque Declaration are summarised under three headings: _The Socio-Cultural Transformation_ * To develop a 'culture of sustainability' * To actively involve citizens, going beyond just participatory planning to co-creative approaches * To re-think boundaries between public and private activities * To promote social innovation, enterprises and civic engagement, focusing especially on marginalised groups and immigrants * To nurture the sharing economy and ideas that combine entrepreneurship, civic engagement and societal transformation _The Socio- Economic Transformation_ * To turn challenges into opportunities for local economies in key areas such as energy and food production * To create and close local value chains, increasing public income and local investment * To apply innovative financing, including crowd-funding and blends of public funding or complementary currencies * To purchase products and services conscientiously, taking into account the environmental, social and economic impacts of purchasing decisions * To pursue development towards a circular economy, reducing the demand of natural resources and waste output _The Technological Transformation_ * To wisely take advantage of smart technologies * To use public procurement as a way to accelerate innovation in the market * To address the digital divide within local societies, focusing on equal access * To support open data standards, keeping data available to the public * The prepare political and governance structures to deal with these changes ==Transformative actions== The Declaration supports local 'transformative actions' and encourages cities to develop and share their sustainability solutions. The Sustainable Cities EU website has a central database where cities can submit their own 'transformative actions'. The idea is that local innovations can inspire other city leaders and where it is possible, help to facilitate replication of successful strategies. To encourage cities to report on their activities a 'Transformative Action Award' was created. == References  External links == * ICLEI Category:Sustainable development ","title":"Basque Declaration"},{"id":"54129453","text":"Chris O'Ryan (born July 6, 1980), known professionally as Tek, is a Grammy Award-winning Australian music producer and sound engineer.

O.Bellamy (Le Monde de la musique). Born in 1970, Demarquette entered at the age of 13 the Conservatoire de Paris where he studied with Philippe Muller and Maurice Gendron. He was unanimously awarded a Premier Prix, and worked with Pierre Fournier and Paul Tortelier before taking lessons from Janos Starker in Bloomington, USA. Familiar with the stage by the time he was fourteen, Demarquette made his concert debut at seventeen with a recital at the Théâtre du Châtelet in Paris and a recording for France 3 Television with pianist Hélène Grimaud. He caught the attention of Lord Yehudi Menuhin, who invited him to play Dvorák’s Concerto in Prague and Paris with Menuhin conducting. His career has been international ever since, taking him to many capitals in the company of the greatest French and international orchestras – most recently the Orchestre national de France, the London Philharmonic, the Vienna Chamber Orchestra, the Paris Orchestral Ensemble, the Tokyo Symphony, the Bordeaux-Aquitaine National Orchestra, the Symphonia Varsovia, the Neue Philharmonie Westphalen, the Orchestre de chambre de Paris. Demarquette has also appeared with his favourite chamber music partners Boris Berezovski, Michel Dalberto, Jean-Bernard Pommier, Fabrizio Chiovetta,Fabrizio Chiovetta's website Vanessa Benelli Mosell and Jean-Frédéric Neuburgerr. In 2006, on the occasion of composer Henri Dutilleux's 90th birthday, his interpretation of the concerto Tout un monde lointain, with the Nationaltheater Mannheim (NTM) orchestra directed by Frédéric Chaslin, gave rise to a film aired on Mezzo TV. In 2011 and 2012, he performed with Saint Petersburg Philharmonic Orchestra, Ural Philharmonic Orchestra, NDR Hanover, Orchestre National de Lille, Orchestre Français des Jeunes, Orchestre Philharmonique de Marseille... He also plays at Théâtre des Champs Elysées with Brigitte Engerer, at the Salle Pleyel with Vadim Repin, at the Berlin Philharmonie, the Salle Gaveau, and the Tokyo International Forum... He has created works by contemporary composers such as Olivier Greif (Durch Adams Fall), Pascal Zavaro (concerto), Éric Tanguy (Nocturne), Florentine Mulsant (sonata), Alexandre Gasparov (Nocturne), Christian Lauba, his New York Concerto with Jonas Vitaud, piano and Richard Ducros, saxophone... Henri Demarquette also performs an eclectic program from Bach to Galliano, in duo with the French accordionist Richard Galliano. In 2014, the duo created “Contrastes” for accordion, cello and orchestra, a composition by Richard Galliano. In 2015, he founded a string quartet with Augustin Dumay, Svetlin Roussev, and Miguel da Silva. Michel Legrand dedicated a concert to Demarquette who performed it for the first time with the Orchestre Philarmonique de Radio France conducted by Mikko Franck and recorded by Sony Music. H.Demarquette created Vocello, an original ensemble for cello and choir a capella together with L’Ensemble Vocal Sequenza 9.3. Their program includes Renaissance pieces in relation with contemporary music. In 2016, Vocello stayed as artist in residence at Collège des Bernardins. Since 2012, H.Demarquette is regularly invited by Michel Onfray to take part in the original project called Université populaire de Caen, together with an essayist, a poet, and a musician called Jean-Yves Clément.Jean-Yves Clément on lisztomanias.fr In 2005, he received an award from the Simone and Cino Del Duca Foundation.

It premiered on 17 July and ended on 28 August 2017. After the show was cancelled, it is returning with a leap due to controversies revolving around child marriage. It starred Tejaswi Prakash and Affan Khan in the lead roles. ==Plot== It follows the life of a young girl Diya, who fulfills the wish of a dying man on his death bed by taking the responsibility of an orphan boy, Ratan Maan Singh, by marrying him. What follows next is a beautiful bond of friendship between the couple and being there for each other in an platonic way. She then becomes the temporary owner of Maan Singh Heritage Group of Hotels until Ratan is old enough to take over. ==Restructured series== Public backlash surrounding the underage marriage of 18-year-old Diya to 9-year-old Ratan prompted producer Shashi Sumeet to end the show and to restructure the idea as a new series, Rishta Likhenge Hum Naya. Affan Khan, who played young Ratan, has been replaced by Rohit Suchanti as an older Ratan. After Pehredaar Piya Ki had aired, an online petition to ban the show was signed by more than 1 lakh people to take action against the show as they believed it was promoting child marriage. The case reached the BCCC, who have asked the makers of the show to change the time slot so the kids couldn't watch it and air it to 10 pm slot along with a disclaimer that it does not promote child marriage. Supporters of the show started the petition too against the ban, to stop targeting the show, which was signed by over 13 thousand supporters. The makers of the show, Sumeet Hukamchand Mittal and Shashi Mittal defended their show by clearing the controversies related to the show by calling a press conference at a suburban hotel in Mumbai. On 19 August 2017, a new promo was released by Sony, that starting from 22 August, the show would air at 10:30 pm IST. On 28 August, Sony TV had confirmed that the show has gone off air as the makers were not happy with the late time slot, as the show was meant for particular audience. Instead of continuing with the show, they decided to end it and focus on their new show instead with a renewed story. ==Cast== Main * Tejaswi Prakash W. as Diya Ratan Singh, Ratan's wife * Affan Khan as Ratan Maan Singh, Diya's Husband.

It is found in Myanmar and India. The species was first described in 1895 from a single specimen. The female was originally misidentified as another species, B. albolimbatus. Males and females look very different due to sexual dimorphism. Only in 2017 was the species rediscovered near Mumbai, India, far away from its original discovery in Myanmar. The epithet \\"cingulatus\\" means \\"wearing a belt\\" in Latin, \\"albolimbatus\\" refers to white limbs. ==Diet and behaviour== This spider preys upon other spiders. To capture web-building spiders, the typical strategy is to stand at the edge of the web and pluck upon the silken strings with its pedipalps, trying out numerous patterns/rhythms until an effective one is found, then to lunge and capture/stab the spider when it gets lured over(aggressive mimicry). Brettus cingulatus does not adhere to spider silk and can walk on webs with ease, but usually does not go into the webs of other spiders. In studies, this spider also readily stalked insects, approaching at fast speeds, then slowing down and eventually lunging at the insect to capture it. However, they prefer to eat web-building spiders. ==References== Category:Salticidae Category:Endemic fauna of Myanmar Category:Spiders of Asia Category:Spiders described in 1895 ","title":"Brettus cingulatus"},{"id":"54129602","text":"No Problem is an album by trumpeter Chet Baker's Quartet featuring Duke Jordan which was recorded in 1979 and released the following year on the Danish SteepleChase label.SteepleChase Productions ApS accessed May 22, 2017Jazzlists: Steeplechase Records 1000/30000 series discography accessed May 22, 2017Chet Baker Catalog accessed May 22, 2017Enciclopedia del Jazz: Chet Baker accessed May 22, 2017 == Reception == The Allmusic review by Ron Wynn states \\"Pianist Duke Jordan's presence adds some punch and spark to this quartet session, which is further helped along by bassist Niels-Henning Ørsted Pedersen and selections that are suited for Baker's increasingly mellow and wavering playing.\\". == Track listing == All compositions by Duke Jordan # \\"No Problem\\" – 9:45 # \\"Sultry Eve\\" – 7:04 # \\"Glad I Met Pat\\" – 5:08 # \\"Kiss of Spain\\" – 7:15 # \\"The Fuzz\\" – 6:05 # \\"My Queen Is Home to Stay\\" – 7:13 # \\"Jealous Blues\\" – 8:48 Bonus track on CD release == Personnel == *Chet Baker – trumpet *Duke Jordan – piano *Niels-Henning Ørsted Pedersen – bass *Norman Fearrington – drums == References == Category:Chet Baker albums Category:1980 albums Category:SteepleChase Records albums Category:Instrumental albums ","title":"No Problem (Chet Baker album)"},{"id":"54129627","text":"Campion is an abandoned townsite in the Wheatbelt region of Western Australia, on the Koorda–Bullfinch Road.

The early decades of his professional career were spent as a member of the East German historical establishment: the focus of much of his work was on the history of the labour movement. He nevertheless remained professionally active and made further important contributions through his published work and teaching during the years after reunification.Curriculum vitae Wolfgang Schröder. In: Wolfgang Schröder: Wilhelm Liebknecht. Soldat der Revolution, Parteiführer, Parlamentarier. Ein Fragment. Karl Dietz, Berlin 2013, , p. 477. == Life == Wolfgang Schröder was born in Dresden just over two years after the Nazi Party took power in Germany, and just under ten years before the central portion of the city was destroyed during the final months of the Second World War. He passed his school final exams (Abitur) in 1953, which opened the way to university-level education. He studied History at the Karl Marx University (as it had recently been renamed) in Leipzig between 1953 and 1957. That year he passed the state exams entitling him to work as a secondary school teacher, and for a year he worked as a secondary school teacher. In 1958 he became a research assistant at the \\"1871–1917 department\\" at the Leipzig branch of the Institute for History of the German Academy of Sciences and Humanities. He received his doctorate in July 1963, supervised by Ernst Engelberg and Lothar Mosler. His subject was the German Trades Union movement in the 1890s. A peculiar feature of the East German university system - taking a lead from the Soviet system - was the Promotion B (loosely \\"Doctorate B\\"), which in terms of building an academic career (though not, protagonists insist, in other respects) took the place of a Habilitation qualification. Schröder received his Promotion B in 1972 for work on the Labour Movement in the final third of the nineteenth century. Between 1969 and 1990 he was employed as editor responsible for the \\"Jahrbuch für Geschichte\\" ([East German] History Yearbook). From 1973 he was also a member of its editorial college. In 1976 he relocated from Leipzig to East Berlin when he switched to working as a researcher at the Central/National Historical Institute at the German Academy of Sciences and Humanities. It was here, in 1986, that he received the title of \\"professor\\". Following the changes of 1989/1990, from 1992 till 1996 Schröder worked as an assistant at the Bonn based Commission for the history of parliamentarianism and political parties [in Germany]. Schröder's main research area was the history of the later nineteenth century, with a particular focus on the German labour movement. He published an article on Ernestine Liebknecht (1989) and an essay on Nathalie Liebknecht (1990) After publishing a book on Ernestine Liebknecht (1897, 2nd ed., 1989) and an essay on Nathalie Liebknecht (1990), his crowning academic achievement was to have been his biography of Wilhelm Liebknecht (1826-1990), a pioneer of the SPD, and the father of Karl Liebknecht (1871 - 1919). Unfortunately, when Wolfgang Schröder died at Taucha (near Leipzig) in 2010, the biography remained unfinished. However, the project was well progressed, and three years later his widow, Renate Dreßler-Schröder and the historian Klaus Kinner were able to publish a version of it in 2013 as part of Schröder's literary legacy. No attempt was made to gloss over the fragmentary nature of the work, but it nevertheless contained a large amount of new research involving hitherto overlooked sources. == Output (selection) == * Klassenkämpfe und Gewerkschaftseinheit.

This was confirmed as a myth by several British police forces who publicly cited the dangers of making such calls. == Basis == The basis for the myth was a feature of BlackBerry phones: If the battery level was too low, the phone automatically locked down phone features and shut down the phone radio for all calls except to emergency services. People discovered that if they dialed 999 then immediately hung up, it would override the shutdown for a number of minutes so that phone calls could be made. == Response == The myth is believed to have originated in BlackBerry forums around 2012. In 2013, Derbyshire Constabulary released a press release telling people not to believe the myth that calling 999 charges the battery. They cited that for every silent or aborted 999 call received, the operators have to call the person back to make sure there is no emergency. These hoax calls waste police time that could potentially block responses to real emergencies. Bedfordshire Police also released information asking people not to call 999 except for an emergency as they stated that in the last six months of 2013 they had an increase in hoax 999 calls from people believing the myth. Other sources supplemented these press releases by stating that misusing the 999 number is illegal. They also stated that the police could cut off telephones being used to abuse the 999 service. A related myth emerged: that when Siri on an iPhone is told, \\"Charge my phone to 100%\\", the phone would call emergency services as a secret safety code. This was later traced to a bug in Apple programming that was fixed within a day. The myth continued to spread on social media as a prank. == References == Category:Emergency services Category:Hoaxes Category:Battery charging Category:BlackBerry Limited Category:Telephone crimes Category:Misconceptions Category:Urban legends ","title":"999 phone charging myth"},{"id":"54129773","text":"The 2017–18 RB Leipzig season was the 9th season in the football club's history and 2nd consecutive and overall season in the top flight of German football, the Bundesliga, having been promoted from the 2.

Historically, attitudes towards Muslims in Sweden have been mixed with relations being largely negative in the early 16th century, improving in the 18th century, and declining once again with the rise of Swedish nationalism in the early 20th century. According to Jonas Otterbeck, a Swedish historian of religion, attitudes towards Islam and Muslims today have improved but \\"the level of prejudice was and is still high.\\" Islamophobia can manifest itself through discrimination in the workforce, prejudiced coverage in the media, and violence against Muslims. The Anti-immigration Anti-Islam Sweden Democrats is the largest party in southern county of Sweden (Skåne). ==History== In the early 16th century, popular ontological discourse in Sweden regarding Islam was largely negative, portraying the religion as fatalistic, fanatic, violent, cruel, and aggressive. A popular painting from the same century depicts Saint Christopher carrying Jesus as a child on his shoulder, saving him from water in which the Pope and Muhammad drown. The painting was aimed at Catholicism, and portrayed the Pope and Muhammad as false prophets. Turks were often used synonymously with Muslims, as a prayer book of Caspar Melissander from 1609 reads, \\"Sweet Lord Jesus Christ, keep us from the Turk, the Tattar, the Pope and all sects.\\" Decrees during the 17th century eventually made practicing Islam illegal, as well as any other religion outside of the Church of Sweden. In 1734, membership in the Church of Sweden was established as a precondition for citizenship, and any non-Lutheran could be banned from entry into the country. During the 18th century, public opinion towards the Muslim world improved with continuous contact to the Ottoman Empire. King Karl XII made exceptions to the aforementioned citizenship laws in 1718, allowing Muslim and Jewish migrants from the Ottoman Empire the right to perform their religion. Opinion towards Islam and Muslims deteriorated once again in the early 20th century with the rise of nationalism and Orientalism in Sweden. Archbishop Nathan Söderblom, teacher and mentor of several of the leading Swedish Orientalist scholars, was highly critical of the faith. Söderblom's attitudes were very impactful to academic discourse, seeing as few Swedish scholars at the time had connection with the Muslim. After the Second World War, the concept of multiculturalism gained support in among the Swedish public and the Swedish government. By the 1980s, the presence of Islam became visible in the Swedish society for the first time and was met with mixed responses. Jonas Otterbeck, a Swedish historian of religion, claims that most Anti-Muslim sentiment in the country were derived from an opposition to traditional Islamic clothing such as the hijab and a belief that Saudi Wahhabism (an extremely conservative movement within Islam) was representative of the entire religion. At the end of the 1980s, extremist xenophobic groups began targeting Muslims as a severe societal problem and causing the recession in Sweden's economy. Håkan Hvitfelt conducted surveys in the 1990s to research the Swedish public's attitudes towards Islam. He found that the majority of Swedes had \\"a rather or very negative attitude to Islam\\" and considered Islam \\"incompatible with democracy, oppressive against women, and expansive\\" in nature. Hvitfelt claimed that media was largely responsible for negative attitudes. Attitudes towards Islam and Muslims in the late 1990s and early 21st century have improved but according to Otterbeck, \\"the level of prejudice was and is still high.\\" ==In employment== A December 2008 study by Jens Agerström and Dan-Olof Rooth of Kalmar University concluded, \\"With respect to attitudes, whereas 49% of the employers explicitly reported having more negative feelings toward Arab-Muslim than native Swedish males, the IAT showed that no less than 94% evidenced a slight implicit attitude bias.\\" When it came to the topic of productivity, \\"78% implicitly associated Arab-Muslim males with less productivity, but only 12% explicitly stated that this target group performs less well than native Swedish males.\\" When employers were directly asked whether they prefer native Swedish to Arab-Muslim males when hiring staff, \\"half of them said they did so.\\" A 2007 study by Moa Bursell of Stockholm University concluded that job applications with names that were perceived to be ethnically Swedish were twice as likely to be called for an interview compared to applications by people of foreign-sounding names, despite identical qualifications. A more recent study from 2012 that used Arabic-sounding names and Swedish-sounding names, and adjusted to make Arabic-sounding applicants more competent and charismatic found that applications with Swedish-sounding names still received more call-backs. Other studies such as a 2013 report by Swedish Muslims in Cooperation Network have referred to the \\"amount of discrimination against Muslims in the labour market\\" as \\"alarming.\\" == In education== A Swedish NGO named EXPO stated in 2015 that both school staff and teaching materials are deficient in avoiding discrimination and stereotypes. Research by Jonas Otterbeck corroborated the conclusion that schoolbooks contained many stereotypes about Islam. A 1993 study by Kjell Härenstam concluded that textbooks often portray Islam as \\"militaristic.\\" Research by Lena Sawyer and Masoud Kamali in 2006 found that school curriculums frequently pushed a \\"clash of civilizations\\" narrative between Swedish society and the Muslim world. A study by Zahra Bayati concluded \\"racialized segregation in society is reconstructed in education, for example in group work or work placements.\\" ==In the media== Research by Ylva Brune in 2006 and Mohammad Fazlhashemi in 2007 concluded that immigrants and Muslims in particular face representations as the ‘other’ and are described with stereotypes often connected to violent behavior. Government agency Equality Ombudsman issued a report in 2015 that found that stereotypes about Muslims are less prevalent in Swedish state-run media. ==In the justice system== There are no laws in Sweden that directly target Muslims but critics of the 2003 Anti-Terrorism Act, such as the Swedish Muslims in Cooperation Network, assert the laws definitions of terrorism are too broad, leading many innocent Muslims to be arrested with little to no probable cause. According to a report cited by Sweden's Televisions news programs Aktuellt and Rapport, at least 26 people have been arrested and 15 have been detained between 2003 and 2011. All of the those arrested have been Muslim. Author and journalist Jan Guillou called the Anti-Terrorism Act a \\"race law in practice.\\" The Swedish National Council for Crime Prevention issued a report in 2008 concluding Muslims are less likely to receive an objective treatment in criminal cases and that Informants to the study expressed that there is a tendency to distrust Muslim suspects, especially if they are men. The study found that stereotypes against Muslims are present throughout all instances of the Swedish justice system. ==In politics== According to Swedish writer J. Lester Feder, opposition to immigration in Sweden is often tied in with the idea of counterjihad and a fear that the \\"nation [will] collapse beneath the weight of Muslim immigration.\\" ==Hate crimes== Some Muslims have been victims of violence because of their religion. In October 1991, Shahram Khosravi, a 25-year-old student of Iranian origin, was shot in the face outside the Stockholm University by John Ausonius. In 1993, two young Somali immigrants were stabbed and a local mosque in the city was burned down. The perpetrators of the stabbing were said by police to have been motivated by racial hatred. The Imam Ali Islamic Centre in Järfälla, the largest Shia mosque in Sweden, was burned down in May 2017 in what police suspect was arson. 2003 and 2005 arson attacks on the Malmö Mosque An arson attack on the Malmö Mosque took place in 2003, which damaged the mosque and totally destroyed other buildings at the Islamic Center. Another attack took place in October 2005. 2014 mosque arson attacks in Sweden A series of arson attacks took place during one week at the end of 2014 on three mosques in Sweden. In addition to being struck by Molotov cocktails, some mosques were vandalized with racist graffiti. ==Organizations== Tryckfrihetssällskapet (Society for Freedom of the Press) is an anti-Muslim lobbying group that gained notoriety in 2012, when one of their leading members assaulted two Muslim women outside a hospital in Malmö while yelling anti-Muslim expletives. ==Opposition== Following arson attacks on mosques late 2014, many Swedes hung cut-out paper hearts on the firebombed mosques to show solidarity with Swedish Muslims. ==See also== *Racism in Sweden *Scania Party *Antisemitism in Sweden *Islamophobia in the United Kingdom ==ReferencesSources== * Category:Racism in Sweden Category:Opposition to Islam in Europe Category:Islamophobia in Europe Category:Racially motivated violence in Europe Category:Islam in Sweden ","title":"Islamophobia in Sweden"},{"id":"54130375","text":"The Carnegie Hall Jazz Band was a big band organized in 1991 by George Wein.

She received a nomination for the Rising Star award in Adelaide's round 7 loss to . Hatchard enjoyed a breakout year in 2019, showing an increased ability to compete in the midfield largely as a result of improved fitness. She attributed this development to a change in diet, specifically cutting down on fast food. Overcoming concussion concerns ahead of a thumping 66-point preliminary final victory against Geelong, she went on to play all nine games culminating in a second premiership with the Crows in three years. Gathering 24 disposals and kicking one goal on the day, Hatchard was recognised as a key performer in her club's 45-point grand final triumph over Carlton, placing second with just one vote less than team mate Erin Phillips in the award for best on ground. Her season was punctuated with a maiden All- Australian selection and a re-commitment to Adelaide by signing a two-year contract during the trade period. == AFLW statistics == : Statistics are correct to the end of the 2019 season {  -  CFECEC; width:1em\\"  Led the league for the season only -  b7e718; width:1em\\"  Led the league after the Grand Final only -  DD6E81; width:1em\\"  Led the league after season and Grand Final } - EAEAEA\\"  scope=\\"row\\" text- align:center  2017   33  7  0  0  20  22  42  9  9  0.0  0.0  2.9  3.1  6.0  1.3  1.3  0 -  scope=\\"row\\" text- align:center  2018   33  4  1  0  14  16  30  4  9  0.3  0.0  3.5  4.0  7.5  1.0  2.3  0 - EAEAEA\\"  scope=\\"row\\" text-align:center  2019   33  9  3  1  60  bgcolor=\\"DD6E81\\"  110  170  24  33  0.3  0.1  6.7  bgcolor=\\"DD6E81\\"  12.2  18.9  2.7  3.7  0 - class=\\"sortbottom\\" ! colspan=3 Career ! 20 ! 4 ! 1 ! 94 ! 148 ! 242 ! 37 ! 51 ! 0.2 ! 0.1 ! 4.7 ! 7.4 ! 12.1 ! 1.9 ! 2.6 ! 0 } ==Personal life== Hatchard's partner is fellow Adelaide player Ailish Considine. == References  External links == * * Category:1998 births Category:Living people Category:Adelaide Football Club (AFLW) players Category:Australian rules footballers from South Australia Category:Lesbian sportswomen Category:LGBT players of Australian rules football Category:LGBT sportspeople from Australia ","title":"Anne Hatchard"},{"id":"54131190","text":"Abbey Holmes (born 7 January 1991) is an Australian rules footballer who played for the Adelaide Football Club in the AFL Women's (AFLW). She began playing football for the Waratah Football Club in the Northern Territory Football League in 2012 and won four consecutive premierships with the club, along with being the league's leading goalkicker the same four seasons. In 2014, she became the first woman to kick 100 goals in a season in an established football league, and in 2016 she was drafted in the inaugural AFL Women's draft by Adelaide. In 2019, Holmes competed in the sixth season of Australian Survivor. She was eliminated on day 46 and finished in fifth place. She would then return to Australian Survivor All Stars the following season where she placed nineteenth. ==Early life and netball career== Holmes was born in Victor Harbor in South Australia. Her father was the president of the Victor Harbor Football Club and her mother was heavily involved in the local netball club. She started playing netball in Victor Harbor and continued when her family moved to Adelaide when she was ten years old. At the age of 15, Holmes made her debut in South Australia's state netball competition and in the same year she represented South Australia at underage national championships. By the age of 16, she was representing Australia in an international schoolgirls tournament. She continued playing netball at a high level and was going to represent South Australia in a national under-19 championship, but she injured her knee two weeks before the tournament and was unable to participate. ==Football career== Early career (2012–2016) Holmes moved to Darwin in the Northern Territory with her partner, Nathan Brown, in 2012 so that Brown, who had previously played in the South Australian National Football League for and , could play in the Northern Territory Football League (NTFL) during the summer (most Australian rules leagues are played in winter). Holmes had planned to continue playing netball in Darwin, but she also began playing football for Waratah Football Club in the women's competition of the NTFL. She played football in the summer and netball in the winter, as the seasons did not overlap. Holmes immediately had success in the NTFL. In her first four seasons, she was both the league's leading goalkicker and a premiership player with Waratah, becoming one of the highest-profile female footballers in the Northern Territory. In 2014, Holmes became the first woman to kick 100 goals in a season in an established women's football league, kicking 105 goals across 15 games in the 2013–14 NTFL season. She kicked seven or more goals in a single match on nine occasions and kicked ten or more thrice, including kicking 16 goals and five behinds in a match against Tracy Village. As a result of her achievement, she was mentioned by name in Federal Parliament. Holmes' success in the NTFL led to her being selected to play in various exhibition matches. She played in a West End Slowdown, sharing player-of-the-match honours with Adelaide legend Andrew McLeod and played in two E. J. Whitten Legends Games. Despite this, she was consistently overlooked by the Melbourne Football Club and the Western Bulldogs, who played annual exhibition matches. After missing out on the 2014 match, she asked then-Melbourne coach Michelle Cowan what she needed to do to improve her game and she was told that her game was too one-dimensional. Rather than staying at full-forward she needed to be able to help her team further up the field, so she started to work on this. During the 2016 NTFL Grand Final, in which Holmes won her fourth consecutive premiership, she suffered torn rib cartilage. The nature of the injury meant there was no rehabilitation beyond just resting and waiting for it to heal. In 2016, she played two exhibition matches representing the Northern Territory, but in both matches she re-tore the cartilage. She was meant to play for the St Kilda Sharks in the Victorian Women's Football League in the 2016 season, but the recurring injury meant she was unable to do anything beyond train. Instead, Holmes started to work for the Seven Network as the boundary rider for their coverage of the Victorian Football League. At the end of the year she also presented the Goal of the Year award to Adelaide player Eddie Betts. AFLW career (2017–2018) Holmes playing for Adelaide in 2018 Holmes was drafted by the Adelaide Football Club with their thirteenth selection and 103rd overall in the 2016 AFL Women's draft, the team she had been supporting for her entire life. Going into the inaugural 2017 AFL Women's season, she was expected to be one of Adelaide's star players, but for the first match of the season she wasn't initially selected to play, only being listed as an emergency replacement. She was a late inclusion into the team and made her debut in the thirty-six point win against at Thebarton Oval. Holmes played every match of the season to finish with eight matches, leading the team in handballs. Her best performance came in round four against when she accumulated 15 possessions, three tackles and kicked a goal. She was part of Adelaide's premiership side after the club defeated by six points at Metricon Stadium in the AFL Women's Grand Final. Adelaide re-signed Holmes for the 2018 season during the trade period in May 2017. She was delisted by Adelaide at the end of the 2018 season. ==Player profile== Holmes primarily plays as a forward. She is capable of taking strong marks both overhead and on a lead. Since 2014, she has also worked on adding more to her game, and now she is able to rotate through the midfield. ==Personal life== In addition to playing Australian rules football and netball, Holmes has also participated in bodybuilding contests. She is a real estate agent by trade and has done work as a part-time model. Her partner is AFL player Keegan Brooksby.

It was located in the eponymous Chakla region, near the historical border between Tibet and China. By the late 1200s, it had been founded around the city of Dartsedo, now known as Kangding. Due to its position, the town formed a trading centre for merchants from Tibet and China, who traded goods such as tea, traditional medicines, horses, and paper; for this reason the Ganden Phodrang government established a taxation regime in the kingdom, headed by a commissioner. The local kings resented the taxation coming from Lhasa, resulting in a rebellion in 1666, backed up by Chakla allying with the emerging Qing dynasty. Ganden Phodrang forces invaded five years later, followed by the murder of the king of Chakla by the commissioner in 1699. However, a year later, the commissioner was killed himself by Qing forces, who reorganised their Tibetan provinces in 1725, removing Chakla from Ganden Phodrang rule. Kingdom of Chakla was annexed by Qing dynasty in 1911; Zhao Erfeng forced the king to abdicate. However, ruler of Chakla had high prestige in Xikang, Beiyang government had to allow them to restore. Finally, the kingdom was annexed in 1950.

The script was based on M.R.Kukrit Pramoj’s 1969 nonfiction book The Fall of the Burmese (พม่าเสียกรุง) and Prince Damrong Rajanubhab’s Journey Through Burma in 1936: A View of the Culture, History and Institutions (เที่ยวเมืองพม่า). Comparisons were made between the costumes of the characters in the 2017 version and those worn by Fan Bingbing in The Empress of China. There were also complaints that some scenes were unrealistic. Soe Win, the great-grandson of Thibaw Min, the last King of Burma, called the drama \\"unwatchable\\" and \\"distasteful\\" and asked for the series to be taken off the air. The producer, Chitralada Disayanon, argued that the plot was \\"“unrelated to Burma and is completely fictional, with the costumes and setting not meant to evoke any country or time period in particular”. However, the massacre of 100 royal family members is a clear reference to events in Burma in 1879. There is also a direct mapping between the members of the Burmese royal family of the time and the characters in the drama: Lady Ananthip is Hsinbyumashin, King Muangkoom is Mindon Min, Queen Pinmanee is Queen Supayalat, King Maanfah is Thibaw Min, Upparat Kanaung is Kanaung Mintha and King Burapha Kham is Tharrawaddy Min. The rating for the finale was and the average nationwide rating for all episodes was Google ranked the phrase \\"Plerng Phra Nang\\" as the fourth most searched term by Thais in 2017, ranked second place in the category of television programs. ==Awards and nominations== {  - ! style=\\"width:50px;\\"Year !

Her poetry has been translated into German, Dutch, French, Spanish, Albanian, Italian, English, and Hebrew.

Since then, Khoury has published eight more books, among them Rings of Salt, published in Lebanon in 1998 by al-Muassa al- Arabiya, Beirut. Another book, The Most Beautiful Goddess is crying, was published in Egypt in 2000 by Markaz al-Khadara, Cairo. Khoury's books published in Akko, Nazareth, and Jerusalem have won positive reviews, particularly The Wind Belt, published by Abu-Rachmon in Akko in 1990. A departure in Khoury's writing is embodied by Book of the Flaw, which was rejected by publishers in the Arab world due to its character and content. It was ultimately published by Kolbo Sfarìm in Haifa in 2011. Book of the Flaw is a modernist book of poetry that addresses Christian theology and challenges the sacrament of Holy Communion as a central Catholic ritual. It demonstrates the breakdown of the source of authority, and undergoes a series of parallel contradictions in the process of attaining redemption. In 2005, Khoury began teaching in the Hebrew Literature Department of Ben-Gurion University. In 2009, she was appointed Senior Lecturer in the department and in the General Studies Department's conflict resolution program. Since 2014, she has served as head of the admissions committee for the conflict resolution program. In 2013, Khoury was appointed Full Professor. She also taught in the Department of Middle East Studies at Ben-Gurion. Since 2011, she has been on the board of directors of the Eliashar Center for the Study of Sephardic Jewry at Ben- Gurion. == Reception == Hannah Amit-Cochavi and Ariel Sheetrit, from the Israeli Writers Concordance, on Khoury: “Her poetry style is sensuous and modernist and her poems stand out in their musicality. Khoury frequently uses first person singular, thus examining the complexities of personal point of view. In addition, she frequently addresses the reader in second person singular, often with vehement defiance. Her poetry exposes her inner world… In contrast, most of her poems focus on oppression of women by men via religion…her writing combines motifs from Christian Scripture and church ritual, which she uses to evoke the intimate ambience that these rituals produce, as well as sharp criticism of the religious establishment…her poetry also contains an element of Ars- Poetical that stems from her awareness of and sensitivity to the power of words and the force of poetry.” Amit Goldenberg of Beit Avi Hai said of Khoury: “The poet Nidaa Khoury is one of the clearest and most interesting voices in her perspective on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Khoury, a champion of the Palestinian struggle, has walked a long path in recent years, and today looks at reality from a fascinating height in all its complexity, seeking to erase boundaries of state and land, and to focus on the individual.” She is also an active participant in human rights and has participated in over 30 international human rights conferences and literary festivals. These include: The Conference of Arab Poets in Amsterdam; The Conference of Human Rights and Solidarity with the Third World in Paris; The Poetry Festival of Jordan; The International Poetry Festival of Medellin; The St. Martin Book Fair; The Napoli Conference on Human Rights. She also works for The Forty Association, an organization that works towards securing human rights of the unrecognized Arab villages in Israel. == Areas of interest == •New Arabic literature from a comparative perspective – mainly between Palestinian Arab literature and Hebrew Israeli literature, as well as the related area of gender and Orientalism and women and nationalism since Israel's establishment •The Israeli-Palestinian conflict from social-literary perspectives. Via the relationships between literature and psychology, Khoury looks at sources of writing and how Palestinian and Israeli artists use the conflict for self- and group definition. •View of life and the conflict, distinguishing between view of existence based on philosophy of place and talking about concepts of existence and collective; and perception of experience based on philosophy of time, and talking about concepts of experience and the individual •Masculine time vs feminine time, as this distinction reflects the paradox of the Israeli who lives in a female period of time after Israel's establishment as a national home, yet his behavior consistent with a male language; and the Palestinian who lives in a male period – that of the pre-state struggle – while his behavior consistent with a female language, all reflecting the depths of the conflict on both sides. •The Dimensions of Creativity model that Khoury developed, which addresses the development of creativity stemming from literature, culture, and psychology research of groups in struggle. The model combines four planes: psychology, creativity, society, and language. Dimensions of Creativity is a psycho-social model that enables examination and analysis combined to a level of development of society, creativity, language, and the link between structure of language and structure of society. •The national-political divide. In addition to the historic and geopolitical divide in Palestinian literature, Khoury proposes a new divide, the national-political divide, which rests on the political- national event and concept, and is derived from the extent of effect and how the national-political event shapes reality in general and literature in particular. •Workshops on developing creativity and creative writing. Combining her vast experience and knowledge of literature, psychology, philosophy, and even graphology, Khoury conducts workshops for undergraduate students in Hebrew and in Arabic for beginners; and advanced workshops for Master’s students. •Conflict Resolution Program – Multiculturalism engages Khoury, and has yielded a course called Multicultural Mediation Using the Narrative Approach, co-taught with attorney Yoni Naftali == Editing == Science editing: Toward Hybrid Poetics: Post-colonial Arabic Literature, Western Modernism Sadak M.

She is based in Los Angeles, London and Stockholm. She cooperates with many magazines and brands such as Nasty Gal, Monki, Wonderland Magazine, Lula Magazine, Vice, Rookie, Garage Magazine, Baby Baby Baby magazine and I heart magazine. ==Early life== Arvida Byström was born on 4 October 1991, near Stockholm. == Art and photography == Byström started taking pictures at age 12 with a digital camera, and took a lot of selfies to “know the truth about how the world sees you”. Initially inspired by Tumblr, she started posting pictures on her account and taking part in a community of female artists questioning feminity and gender standards, using a so-called “girly” aesthetic and “girly coded stuff”. Byström also took pictures about period-related things in the series There Will Be Blood, published in Vice, on 17 May 2012. She also assumed and valorized female body hair during this period. Byström then moved to London to become more independent. She made her first fashion series for Monki and created her own gallery space, GAL, with fellow photographer and friend Hanna Antonsson. Through GAL they curated emerging artists for one night shows. In spite of this, Byström still positioned herself as being more a part of popular culture than the art world. As a member of the female collective The Ardorous, Byström presented some of her photographs in Babe – a book published in May 2015, including the work of 30 other female artists, curated by Petra Collins. The same year, Byström took part in the exhibition Girls At Night On The Internet, curated by Grace Miceli, together with artists such as Collins, Molly Soda and Maggie Dunlap. The show dealt with the misrepresentation of young artists in the art world and showcased their work. Taking part in creating an online culture that aims at reinventing body norms and self- empowerment, Byström created a performance with the artist Maja Malou Lyse, which was called Selfie Stick Aerobics, a tutorial aimed to teach participants how to take better selfies while accepting their bodies to make them feel beautiful. In October 2015, Byström and Lyse published a video about this performance on YouTube. Byström explores self-identity as a queer woman and questions sexualized women's bodies. She decided to put together a book with the artist Molly Soda about Instagram censorship, called Pics or It Didn’t Happen: Images Banned From Instagram. The book was released in March 2017 and showcases mostly pictures of women's bodies that Instagram has taken down. == References == Category:Swedish women artists Category:Swedish women photographers Category:Living people Category:1991 births Category:Place of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Arvida Byström"},{"id":"54131398","text":"right Vic Hutfield (born Gosport, Hampshire 26 May 1887) was a British engineer and builder of aircraft, including The R.A.S.

In 1931 he moved to the Soviet Union where he first worked as a teacher, then from 1936 on as a research associate of the developmental biologist Julius Schaxel (a fellow German expatriate), at the Academy of Sciences of the USSR. Starting in 1943, he instructed German prisoners of war at an anti-fascist school. After the collapse of the Nazi regime, Schneider returned to Germany as a member of the \\"Ackermann Group\\" and became politically active in Saxony. After the Soviet Military Administration in Germany had assumed command in Thuringia, Schneider was appointed as a Thuringian KPD district leader by Walter Ulbricht. Among other things, his activities included the removal of the Social Democrat Hermann Brill from his post as president of the Regierungsbezirk. Owing to Schneider's organizational incompetence and doctrinaire behaviour, in the autumn of 1945 he was pushed out of government and steered towards the university system in Jena. In this capacity, he became head of the \\"Ernst Haeckel House\\" in 1947 and also pushed for the reintroduction of the Lebensreform magazine \\"Urania\\". During his time in the Soviet Union, Schneider had become an advocate of the now-discredited scientific theories of Michurin and Lysenko. In 1951, his embrace of these theories popular with the Soviet leadership led him to a professorship at the University of Jena. In 1959, he lost this position and was sent to Moscow in the diplomatic service of the German Democratic Republic, from which he returned in 1962. From 1950 to 1954, Schneider served as a deputy for the Socialist Unity Party (SED) in the Volkskammer of the GDR, then served from 1954 to 1958 on the district council (Bezirkstag) for the district of Gera, in which the city of Jena lay. Schneider died in 1970 in a car accident in Jena. == Publications == * Die Evolutionstheorie, das Grundproblem der modernen Biologie (The Theory of Evolution, the basic problem of modern biology), Deutscher Bauernverlag, Berlin 1950 == References == *Steffen Kachel: Ein rot- roter Sonderweg?

It starred Rachana Parulkar, Asha Negi, Ashish Chaudhary and Shilpa Shirodkar. == Synopsis == Reach for the stars follows the story of Kalpana \\"Kalpi\\" Jadhav (Rachana Parulkar) and Raghav Singhania (Ashish Chaudhary), as their paths cross on a journey of self improvement. Kalpi is the daughter of a maid, Kamla Jadhav (Shilpa Shirodkar), and a mill worker, Vitthal Jadhav (Mohit Dagga). Her mother's dream is to become a part of the middle class so she works tirelessly. Kalpana selflessly loves her mother, but is deprived of her love and attention because Kamla is always busy looking after family members of her employers, mostly Pakhi Kapoor (Shirina Singh). Raghav Singhania is a rich businessman whose mission is to take revenge from the Kapoors who murdered his father. Raghav has always been in debt to Kamla as she helped him escape from the Kapoors who wanted to adopt him and take away all his wealth. He becomes attracted to Kalpi's sweet, simple and caring nature and falls in love with her. Eventually, Kalpana recognizes Raghav's feelings and reciprocates. Raghav and Kalpana fall in love, and with the blessing of their parents, plan their wedding. On the day of his wedding to Kalpi, Raghav marries Pakhi Kapoor instead. Eventually, Raghav realizes his mistake but cannot rectify it because his mother, Gauri, wants him to use his marriage to Pakhi in her plans against the Kapoors. In order to prove his love for Kalpi, he marries her by putting the sindoor on her forehead in a temple. Paakhi hires goons to kidnap Kalpi and keep her in a remote location. Later, Raghav learns where Paakhi is hiding Kalpi and rescues her. A car chase ensues in which the car drives off a cliff and blows up. Some fishermen find Kalpi in the river and take her to a hospital; Raghav is still missing. While in the hospital, Dhiraj Diwan is depressed over his niece Suhana's (Asha Negi) death. When he hears how Kalpi's face has been burned and that she has lost her memory, he requests the doctor to perform a plastic surgery procedure to make Kalpi look like Suhana. The surgery is successful. Suhana has flashbacks of her real family, the accident and struggles to believe she is indeed Suhana Diwan. On the day Suhana is to marry Aryan (Kunal Varma), she realizes that she is Kalpi and she marries Raghav instead. == Cast == * Rachana Parulkar/Asha Negi as Kalpana/Suhana * Ashish Chaudhary as Raghav * Shilpa Shirodkar as Kamla * Mohit Dagga as Vittal * Shireena Sambyal as Pakhi Category:Indian television series ","title":"Reach For The Stars (Indian TV series)"},{"id":"54132404","text":"John Philip Steven Gearson (born March 1963) is professor of national security studies in the Department of War Studies at King's College London.Professor John Gearson.

(born 1934) is a Czech physical chemist. == Life and work == Herman studied physical chemistry and radiochemistry at the School of Mathematics and Physics of Charles University, Prague (1952–57). He then joined the Institute of Physical Chemistry of the Czech Academy of Sciences, to which he remains affiliated. Herman's early work, with Vladimír Čermák concerned mass spectrometric studies of the kinetics of collision and ionization processes of ions (chemical reaction of ions, Penning and associative ionization). During his post-doctoral years (1964–65), with Richard Wolfgang at Yale University, Herman built one of the first crossed beam machines to study ion-molecule processes. Herman also built an improved crossed beam machine that was used in Prague with colleagues to investigate the dynamics of ion-molecule and charge transfer reactions of cations and dications, and ion-surface collisions by the scattering method (1970-2010). Herman has published over 240 scientific articles in this field. == Awards == Herman's academic awards include the Ian Marcus Marci Medal (Czech Spectroscopic Society, 1989), the Alexander von Humboldt Research Prize (awarded in Germany in 1992, the first time the prize was awarded to a Czech natural scientist), the Česká hlava (\\"Czech Head\\") National Prize for lifetime achievements (2003), an Honorary Degree from the Leopold-Franzens University in Innsbruck (2007), and honorary membership of the Czech Mass Spectrometric Society.

As with similar greenhoods, the flowering plants differ from those which are not flowering. The non-flowering plants have a rosette of leaves flat on the ground but the flowering plants have a single flower with leaves on the flowering spike. This greenhood has white and green flowers which have a long, curved, pointed labellum which extends beyond the sinus between the lateral sepals. ==Description== Pterostylis revoluta is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and when not flowering, a rosette of between three and seven greyish to bluish, egg-shaped leaves. Each leaf in the rosette is 10–30 mm long and 4–12 mm wide. Flowering plants have a single flower 20–25 mm long, 9–12 mm wide and which lean forwards slightly. The flower is borne on a flowering stem 100–150 mm high with between three and five leaves wrapped around the stem. The flowers are pale green and white with a brown tinge. The dorsal sepal and petals are fused, forming a hood or \\"galea\\" over the column. The dorsal sepal curves forward and downward with a thread-like tip 4–8 mm long. The lateral sepals are held closely against the galea, have an erect, curved thread-like tip 20–25 mm long and a narrow V-shaped sinus between their bases. The labellum is 14–17 mm long, about 3 mm wide, curved, pointed and extends for about half its length above the sinus. Flowering occurs from February to June. ==Taxonomy and naming== Pterostylis revoluta was first formally described in 1810 by Robert Brown and the description was published in the Prodromus Florae Novae Hollandiae et Insulae Van Diemen. The specific epithet (revoluta) is a Latin word meaning \\"turned over\\" or \\"rolled back\\". ==Distribution and habitat== The autumn greenhood grows on sheltered slopes in forest and in coastal scrub in coastal and near-coastal area from south-east Queensland to Nowra in New South Wales and as far inland as Cessnock. ==References== revoluta Category:Endemic orchids of Australia Category:Orchids of New South Wales Category:Orchids of Queensland Category:Plants described in 1810 ","title":"Pterostylis revoluta"},{"id":"54132479","text":"Brundle is a surname.

Braga's youth system at the age of 13. On 7 May 2017, whilst still a junior, he made his professional debut with their reserves, coming on as a second-half substitute in a 2–3 home loss against FC Porto B for the Segunda Liga. The following weekend, in his first Primeira Liga appearance with the first team, he scored after only a few minutes on the pitch, helping the hosts defeat already relegated C.D. Nacional 4–0 and becoming the club's youngest ever goal scorer in the competition. On 31 August 2017, both Neto and teammate Bruno Jordão were loaned to S.S. Lazio from Italy for two years, with an obligation to subsequently buy for a combined €26 million. He only played his first match in Serie A on 27 January 2019, replacing Bastos in the last-minute of the 1–2 home loss to Juventus FC. Wolverhampton Wanderers On 2 August 2019, Neto signed with Wolverhampton Wanderers. He made his debut twelve days later in the second leg of the UEFA Europa League third qualifying round against FC Pyunik, scoring and providing an assist for Morgan Gibbs-White in a 4–0 home win (8–0 aggregate). His maiden appearance in the Premier League took place a few days later in the same month, when he came on for compatriot Diogo Jota late on in the 1–1 home draw to Manchester United. Neto's first league start occurred on 28 September 2019, when he assisted Matt Doherty's opening goal in a 2–0 victory over Watford at Molineux. After having what would have been his first goal in the competition ruled out controversially by VAR at Liverpool on 29 December, he scored in the next game in a 2–1 away loss against Watford, becoming the first teenager to achieve the feat for the club in the Premier League in the process. Neto scored his debut Premier League goal at Molineux during Wolves' 1–0 victory over Fulham on 4 October 2020. ==International career== On 5 September 2019, aged 19, Neto won his first cap for Portugal at under-21 level, playing the first half of a 4–0 win against Gibraltar for the 2021 UEFA European Championship qualification campaign, held in Alverca do Ribatejo. ==Personal life== Neto's uncle, Sérgio Lomba, was also a footballer. ==Career statistics== {   + Appearances and goals by club, season and competition - !rowspan=\\"2\\"Club !rowspan=\\"2\\"Season !colspan=\\"3\\"League !colspan=\\"2\\"National Cup !colspan=\\"2\\"League Cup !colspan=\\"2\\"Europe !colspan=\\"2\\"Total - !Division!!Apps!!Goals !Apps!!Goals !Apps!!Goals !Apps!!Goals !Apps!!Goals - rowspan=\\"3\\"Braga 2016–17 rowspan=\\"2\\"Primeira Liga 2100000021 - 2017–18 1000000010 - !colspan=\\"2\\"Total !3!!1!!0!!0!!0!!0!!0!!0!!3!!1 - Lazio (loan) 2018–19 Serie A 4010colspan=2—0050 - rowspan=\\"3\\"Wolverhampton Wanderers 2019–20 rowspan=\\"2\\"Premier League 2932020112445 - 2020–21 510010colspan=2—61 - !colspan=\\"2\\"Total !34!!4!!2!!0!!3!!0!!11!!2!!50!!6 - !colspan=\\"3\\"Career total !41!!5!!2!!0!!3!!0!!11!!2!!57!!7 } ==ReferencesExternal links== * *Portuguese League profile *National team data Category:2000 births Category:Living people Category:People from Viana do Castelo Category:Portuguese footballers Category:Association football wingers Category:Primeira Liga players Category:LigaPro players Category:S.C.

Any web resource (like a HTML page) can advertise a receiving endpoint (inbox) for notification messages. Messages are expressed in RDF, and can contain arbitrary data. == Motivation == The web is a decentralized system of web resources, published by multiple organizations and individuals. Web resources, such as web pages and more formally structured Linked Data, frequently include links to other resources across the web, and may comment or describe them in various ways. The receiving end, however, are not generally notified of such link creation, and thus are unable to provide backlinks without manual intervention. Interactions within social media platforms, such as comments on a news article, are currently \\"locked\\" within the platform and hard to access across the web. Several linkback mechanisms exists, and are commonly used between blog systems, e.g. a \\"response\\" post in blog B about a post in blog A causes B's platform to send a pingback to be shown on the original blog A. These mechanisms are however generally limited in which structured information can be sent, and the notifications themselves do not form part of the decentralized web and may be difficult to consume by any third party application. A key motivation for LDN is to support notifications between decentralized Web applications , including web browsers who - not having their own HTTP server - are unable to generate a HTTP link for their reply messages. Another motivation is to structure notifications as RDF statements using any Controlled vocabulary - so that any consuming application can select the particular information they understand. == Protocol == * A sender or receiver performs a \`GET\` or \`HEAD\` to an existing HTTP resource. Its inbox URI is discovered from either: ** A \`Link:\` relation in the HTTP response headers of type \`http://www.w3.org/ns/ldp#inbox\` ** An RDF statement embedded in the HTTP body using the RDF property \`http://www.w3.org/ns/ldp#inbox\` * A sender creates a new notification (e.g. as JSON-LD), which it \`POST\`s to the inbox URI. ** The receiver creates a new HTTP resource containing the posted notification and responds with \`201 Created\` and the created URI. * A consumer retrieves RDF from the discovered inbox URI using \`GET\`, then: ** The consumer parses the response body to find RDF statements with the property \`http://www.w3.org/ns/ldp#contains\`. The object of these statements give the URIs to the accepted LDN notifications. ** The consumer retrieve any of the linked notification using \`GET\` and process their RDF in an application- specific manner. ** Notifications remain accessible, and can therefore be linked to and described in other web resources. At each stage, the sender and consumer may perform content negotiation to send or receive in any mutually agreed RDF serialization format, however a compliant LDN receiver must support at least JSON-LD. == Examples == A sender or consumer discovers the inbox for a given URI, in this example using the \`HEAD\` method: HEAD http://example.org/article/5 HTTP/1.1 HTTP/1.1 200 OK Link: ; rel=\\"http://www.w3.org/ns/ldp#inbox\\" A sender sends a notification to the discovered inbox, in this example using the Schema.org vocabulary: POST http://example.org/inbox/7 HTTP/1.1 Content-Type: application/ld+json { \\"@context\\": \\"http://schema.org\\", \\"@type\\": \\"ReviewAction\\", \\"object\\" : { \\"@id\\": \\"http://example.org/article/5\\" }, \\"agent\\": { \\"@type\\": \\"Person\\", \\"name\\": \\"Alice\\" }, \\"result\\": { \\"@type\\": \\"Review\\", \\"reviewBody\\": \\"This article is the best I've ever seen!\\" } } HTTP/1.1 201 Created Location: http://example.org/inbox/f44f3f11 A consumer lists the content of the discovered inbox to find 3 notifications: GET http://example.org/inbox/7 HTTP/1.1 Content-Type: application/ld+json HTTP/1.1 200 OK Content-Type: application/ld+json { \\"@context\\": \\"http://www.w3.org/ns/ldp\\", \\"@id\\": \\"http://example.org/inbox/7\\", \\"contains\\": [ \\"http://example.org/inbox/5c6ca040\\", \\"http://cdn.example.org/inbox/92d72f00\\", \\"http://example.org/inbox/f44f3f11\\", ] } Note that the URIs of the original resource, inbox and notifications are not required to be hosted on the same HTTP server (e.g. they may be on a CDN). The consumer follows the links for any notifications they wish to retrieve. In this example, the consumer retrieves the new \`f44f3f11\` notification, with content negotiation to prefer the Turtle RDF format: GET http://example.org/inbox/f44f3f11 HTTP/1.1 Accept: application/ld+json;q=0.9, text/turtle;q=1.5 HTTP/1.1 200 OK Content-Type: text/turtle @prefix schema: .

The organisation single-handedly led the campaign that brought about the signing of a Private Bill into Law that created the National Agency for the Prohibition of Trafficking In Persons (NAPTIP) and also mobilised organisations nationwide in Nigeria to establish Network of Civil Society organisation Against Child Trafficking, Abuse and Labour (NACTAL). It was founded in 1999 by Chief Mrs. Amina Titi Atiku-Abubakar the wife of Atiku Abubakar, a Former Vice-President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. It has since remained at the forefront of the fight against Trafficking in Persons in Nigeria and inspiring change in other African countries. ==History== In 1986, as an International Postgraduate student in Italy, Titi Atiku saw a lot of Nigerian and African girls on the streets of Italy. When she inquired she, was shocked to find out that they were into forced labour and had to use their bodies in exchange for money. She got into action immediately and started speaking against Trafficking in Persons by encouraging the people involved to come back home. Upon her return to Nigeria, she intensified her fight against Trafficking but she could only achieve a little as an individual though she knew that Trafficking In Persons was a growing menace that must be stopped. Angered by this reality, she nursed the dream and desire to establish an anti-human trafficking organisation. In 1999, her husband was sworn in as the Vice President of Nigeria and she saw the window of opportunity for the Fight Against Trafficking in Persons to begin! And she established Women Trafficking and Child Labour Eradication Foundation (WOTCLEF). At the time, HIV/AIDS was the major issue being tackled by development partners in Nigeria. So WOTCLEF embarked on massive awareness campaign against Trafficking and Child Labour, Advocacy to political office holders and massive mobilization of activists in Nigeria. Communities were informed, Nigerians became alert of trafficking and child labour, all hands were mobilized to be on the deck against the scourge. Every state in Nigeria had a WOTCLEF branch with people who served as the watchdogs against Trafficking and Child Labour. That was how the fight against Trafficking became a National and international issue that attracted government, NGO and Development partners. ==The Legacy== WOTCLEF found out that to end trafficking in persons, government must be actively involved. The dream to establish a Law against Trafficking in Persons was conceived by the Founder. In 2001, after a rigorous work by legal and policy experts led by Justice Mary Odili the First Lady of Rivers State, WOTCLEF presented Private Bill to the National Assembly which was passed and signed into the Law by former President Olusegun Obasanjo. The signing led to the establishment of National Agency for Prohibition of Trafficking in Persons (NAPTIP). NAPTIP has since began operation since 2003 rescuing victims and punishing traffickers while providing rehabilitation and support for rescued trafficked persons. This is a major legacy of WOTCLEF. ==International Activities== Apart from her national programmes, WOTCLEF has carried out campaign activities in different European countries and United States of America. The organization has collaborated with international organization to receive and rehabilitate victims of human trafficking ==Partnership== Because of her deep experience and impact in combating human trafficking, WOTCLEF has partnered with the following national and international organizations: * Care and Support Unit of the Federal Ministry of Labour and Productivity. * Nigerian Union of Road Transport Workers, International Labour Organization (ILO)/International Programme on the Elimination of Child Labour (IPEC). United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF). * International Organization for Migration (IOM). * National Agency for Prohibition of Trafficking In Persons and other related matters (NAPTIP). * National Council of Women's Societies. * European Union. ==Rehabilitation== The organization has treated over 500 cases of human trafficking and child labour. In 2015, WOTCLEF rehabilitated 20 trafficked victims within the age of 18 to 22. They were empowered and reintegrated into the society. ==ReferencesExternal links== * * Interview with the founder Category:Human trafficking in Africa Organizatons Category:Non-profit organizations based in Nigeria Category:Human rights organizations based in Nigeria Category:Youth organizations based in Nigeria ","title":"Women Trafficking and Child Labour Eradication Foundation"},{"id":"54132779","text":"João Ricardo Pereira Queirós (born 22 April 1998) is a Portuguese professional footballer who plays for German club 1.

When built, the Westwood property was , mainly consisting of a large parking lot. By the time Etobicoke was amalgamated with Toronto by Mike Harris' provincial Progressive Conservative Government in 1998 as a cost-saving measure, the land the theatre and its parking lot occupied was too valuable to be used as a theatre. The theatre shut its doors in 1998, and lay vacant until 2013. As an independent city before amalgamation, Etobicoke's city hall, and other civic buildings occupied a campus on The West Mall that was only conveniently reached by car, a site which has continued post-amalgamation as a civic and community centre. However, its new civic centre is proposed to be moved to this former Westwood site, within walking distance of the Kipling and Islington subway stations. According to local cinema historian Doug Taylor, author of Toronto Theaters and the Golden Age of the Silver Screen, the theatre's design was \\"utilitarian\\", even though it had been designed by architectural firm Kaplan and Sprachman, which had specialized in designing many of Canada's art deco cinemas.

Her first name frequently appears as Supha. She is married to Viriya Sirisingh, a well-known publisher. Supa Sirisingh is best known for her novel, Letters from Thailand (Chotmai Chak Muang Thai). ==Early life== The youngest daughter in her family, Sirisingh was born in the Phasi Charoen District of Thonburi, separated from Bangkok by the Chao Phraya River. Sirisingh's father was an immigrant from southern China, and her mother was of Chinese descent born in Thailand. She spent much of her childhood working at her parents orchard in Thonburi. Even though her father didn't believe in educating women, she managed to earn enough scholarships, the first of which she won when she was nine years old, to put herself through secondary and primary school, and then through college. ==Education== Sirisingh went to the Sutham Sueksa School for her primary and lower secondary schooling. She continued her upper secondary schooling at Watthana Sueksa School, and, finally, she graduated from high school and earned her diploma at the Triam Udom Sueksa School. She went on to earn her BA and MA degrees in 1966, from Chulalongkorn University in Bangkok, with a double major in English and Thai. ==Career== Woodland Peony Sirisingh first worked as a teacher before becoming a magazine editor, and then a freelance writer. In 1965, she was working as a writer for a Thai women's magazine named Satrisan when she first started using the pen name \\"Botan\\", one of many she would use throughout her career. She still works as a freelance writer and has published more than sixty novels. Many of her books have been successfully adapted for television and film. ==Works== Letters from Thailand Sirisingh's novel, Letters from Thailand (Chotmai Chak Muang Thai), was written when she was twenty-one. Susan Fulop Kepner translated the book into English thirteen years later, and it was published in Thailand. Her highly acclaimed novel, which depicts the conflict between Chinese-Thai cultures and the life of ethnic Thais, is one of the best-known English translations of a Thai literary work, and it has been translated into ten languages. The book was never formally published in the West. At the time of its writing, Letters from Thailand was considered controversial because the author refused to leave out aspects of the prevalent culture, opinions, or family matters that others would have ignored. Many Chinese-Thais as well as some native Thais found reasons to be offended by the way their cultures were depicted in the novel. The book consists of ninety-six letters, ranging from 1945 to 1967, written by a young man to his mother as he makes his way south from south China to emigrate to Thailand. That Woman's Name is Boonrod That Woman's Name is Boonrod (Phu Ying Khon Nan Chue Boonrod) was published in Thailand in 1980. Vichit Kounavudhi (1922–1997) directed an independent film based on That Woman's Name is Boonrod in 1985. The film was featured at the Bangkok International Film Festival in 2005. Waewvan Waewvan is briefly mentioned. The title does not translate to English, but like other books Sirisingh has written, it is about the plight of Thai women in the male- dominated Chinese culture. ==Awards== Sirisingh received the (SEATO) literary award for Letters from Thailand in 1969, the same year it was published. Some time later, the book would become required reading in high school in an effort to promote detente between the Thai and Chinese cultures. Thirty years later, in 1999, Sirisingh was named a Thailand National Artist of the Year. == References == Category:1947 births Category:Living people Category:Thai novelists Category:Thai women short story writers Category:National Artists of Thailand Category:Pseudonymous writers Category:Pseudonymous women writers ","title":"Supa Sirisingh"},{"id":"54132946","text":"In June 2014, France played a three-test series against Australia as part of the 2014 mid-year rugby union tests.

It was officially opened on 7 April 1935. ==Description== It is one of the most modern buildings in Belgrade, implemented in the spirit of modern architecture, built of reinforced concrete, brick, iron and glass. It is conceived as an extremely modern business and residential building of cubic form, interpolated into a series of adjacent objects.Вања Панић, Начела модерне у архитектури јавних објеката у Београду, период 1918–1941, рукопис докторске дистертације одбрањене на Архитектонском факултету Универзитета у Београду 2013. године, 162–171. Its spatial organization applied several elements of Corbusier free plan, with a liquid, flexible and functionally interchangeable space with a spacious club room on the ground floor. The glazed circular staircase, in the spirit of the constructivist-functionalist doctrine, drawn into a vertical rectangular concrete frame with rectangular loggias, was a very innovative motif in the Belgrade architecture of the time. The facade of the journalists' house is smooth, without ornaments and zone divisions, based on the axis of symmetry and highlighting the main motif. The flat facade is accentuated by the free poles on the ground floor, horizontal floors and accented by a final withdrawn storey. ==Significance== In the scientific and publicizing historiography of Serbian architecture from its erection until today, the house stands out as the most consistent example of early Belgrade functionalistic architecture, and as the cleanest monument of modern architecture from the first half of the fourth decade of the last century, which lead it to be declared a cultural monument.Завод за заштиту споменика културе града Београда, досије споменика културе Дом удружења новинара Србије. in 1997. The Journalists' House is one of the most significant buildings in Belgrade conceived in a modern spirit. In addition to its architectural value, it is important as a meeting place for journalists, publicists, writers and prominent personalities from the cultural life of Serbia. ==See also== • List of cultural monuments in Belgrade • Serbian Journalists' Association == Sources  External links == * Republic Institute for the Protection of Cultural Monuments – Belgrade * Republic Institute for the Protection of Cultural Monuments-Belgrade/Immovable cultural property base * List of monuments Category:Protected Monuments of Culture Category:Buildings and structures in Belgrade Category:Event venues in Serbia Category:Concrete buildings and structures Category:Commercial buildings completed in 1934 Category:Commercial buildings in Serbia Category:Mixed-use developments Category:Residential buildings in Serbia Category:1934 establishments in Yugoslavia Category:Apartment buildings Category:Vračar ","title":"Serbian Journalists' Association building"},{"id":"54132983","text":"Hondamuni Ian Aloysious de Zoysa was a Sri Lankan politician.

It is located in Belgrade, in the municipality of Palilula, at 9 Ljubomira Stojanovića Street. The house was built in 1927 under the then newly formed \\"Professor's Colony\\". From 1926, in the area of the colony, residential buildings were erected with favourable loans of the Treasury and at first, the owners of the houses were exclusively associated with the University of Belgrade. The Professor's Colony with the radial streets system and semicircular square followed the current urban planning ideas in the third decade of the 20th century, and the idea of garden cities. The colony supposed, apart from the unified allotment, relatively unified type of buildings as well. Most of the buildings in the Professor's Colony were created on the basis of standardized projects which were built by the architects Svetozar Jovanović, Mihailo Radovanović and Petar Krstić at the beginning of 1926. The project of the house of Milutin Milanković was also signed by the architects Jovanović, Radovanović and Krstić. This is a modest villa, it was similar to other houses in the area of Professor's Colony. The facades were simple, but in terms of architectural and urban value, it represents the exponent of the idea of colonies or garden cities. The maximum value of the house lies in the fact that Мilutin Milanković (1879–1958) lived in it, a famous person not only of Serbian but also of world science, professor, academician whose interests ranged from mathematics, through building construction and reform of the Julian calendar, to the famous geophysical theory, such as the astronomical theory of the glacial era. A crater on the Moon was named after him, in his honour, as well as an asteroid in the solar system. Today, the only testimony that Milutin Milanković lived and worked in the house is a memorial plaque, since the heirs do not live in it. ==See also== *List of cultural monuments in Belgrade ==SourcesLiterature== *(Serbian) House of Milutin Milanković in the Catalogue of immovable cultural property of the City of Belgrade (http://beogradskonasledje.rs) ==External links== *The house in which a scientist created is not for sale („Večernje novosti“, 31 January 2016) Category:Buildings and structures in Belgrade Category:Houses completed in 1927 ","title":"House of Milutin Milanković"},{"id":"54132999","text":"Leading Lady is a comedy-drama film directed by Henk Pretorius, produced by Llewelynn Greeff, and starring Katie McGrath, Bok van Blerk and American actor Gil Bellows as the film's antagonist, Daniel Taylor, a fictional Hollywood movie director.

He became a ski instructor in 1996, snowboard instructor in 1997 and has been a Matterhorn alpine guide since 2000 and national alpine guide instructor since 2007. ==Career== He began his career as a mountaineer on his home mountain, the Matterhorn, climbing new routes and repeating various prestigious ones. After growing up in the shadow of this mountain, it was right here where Hervé completed various extreme solo ascents. The most noteworthy of these ascents include the first solo ascent of the Via Casarotto Grassi in 2002 (ED, 1300m), the first solo ascent in 2005 of the Via Deffeyes (ED, 1300m) completed in under four hours, and in 2007 the first solo ascent of the Spigolo dei fiori on the Via Machetto route: all routes on the south face of the Matterhorn. A further noteworthy ascent was the first solo ascent and first repetition of the Via Direttissima which was first climbed in 1983 by his father Marco. The pursuit and exploration of unclimbed faces led him away from the Alps and in 2004 he climbed two new routes in Pakistan: Luna Caprese on the Chogolisa Shield and another route on Sheep Peak (6300m). His experience in Pakistan continued in 2005 and in addition to the solo ascent of an unclimbed peak on the Farol Peak ridge, he also climbed two new routes with companions from the Trip One Karakorum expedition: Up and Down (6c/7a and A1, 800m) and Fast and Furious, a mixed ice and rock route, this too on an unclimbed peak. In spring 2006 in Patagonia, during his first trip to South America, he completed another remarkable achievement when he climbed a new ice and mixed route called Café Cortado (1200m) on the north face of Cerro San Lorenzo. thumb On 8 February 2008, together with Cristian Brenna, Hervé cracked the enigma of the northwest face of Cerro Piergiorgio (Patagonia) which for years had been the object of numerous attempts by top mountaineers. “La Ruta de lo Hermano”, a route on poor quality rock, runs right through the middle of the heart of this immense face for 1150 metres: 29 pitches graded as 6b+ A3 ED+. In the summer of 2008, together with his climbing partner Simone Moro, Hervé climbed Beka Brakai Chhok in alpine style, a 6940m mountain in the Karakoram region (Pakistan), attempted numerous times by various expeditions. In autumn 2008, he climbed a 6250m unclimbed peak on Muztagh-ata (China) in alpine style. In early 2010 he returned to Pakistan together with Eneko Pou, Kris Erickson, Oscar Gogoza and Dr. Marco Cavana; after the ascent of some ice falls he organised the first course for high altitude porters also open to women at the Shimshal Climbing School, with the goal of training and teaching safe techniques for progression on rock and ice. Furthermore, thanks to the help of Dr. Marco Cavana, an intensivist from Aosta hospital, he organised the setting up of a dispensary to deal with health-care problems in the area. On 17 March 2010 he climbed a new route with his father Marco on the south face of the Matterhorn – the Couloir Barmasse (1200m, hard mixed route, ABO). In the summer of 2010 he completed an alpine style ascent in two days together with Daniele Bernasconi and Mario Panzeri of the 6300m unclimbed Venere Peak, graded ED (China). For the fourth time he received the coveted Paolo Consiglio Award for mountaineering. thumb In 2011 the \\"Exploring the Alps\\" project was carried out, a trilogy with the aim of climbing three new routes on the most important mountains in the valley which are also some of the highest in the Alps: Mont Blanc, Monte Rosa and the Matterhorn. These three new routes enabled Hervé to rediscover alpinism in the Alps and show that exploration is still possible in these places. Out of the three ascents, the Matterhorn was without doubt the most challenging. Hervé tackled it solo, astounding the mountaineering world with his audacity and the immense risk he undertook during the three-day ascent. The route first climbed by Barmasse extends over 1200 metres, 500m of which are in a frozen couloir with the rest of the route on the vertical and overhanging face of Picco Muzio. This achievement evokes the feat accomplished in 1965 by the great alpinist Walter Bonatti – the only person to have solo climbed a new route on the Matterhorn before Barmasse. On completing this achievement, Bonatti bid farewell to his career as an extreme alpinist. In 2012 Barmasse made a film about the Exploring the Alps project, called Not so far. The film participated at the most important international mountain film festivals, winning major awards. After an attempt on the unclimbed north face of Gasherbrum I (8068m) and a long break due to a problem with his spine, Hervé returned to Patagonia in 2013, but this time in winter. There he completed the first winter ascent of Cerro Pollone and the first ever ascent in winter of two of the Colmillos peaks.

He was the high priest of Anhur under Merenptah, but started his career as a military man, most likely under king Ramesses II (reigned about 1279–1213 BC). Anhurmose is mainly known from his tomb at El Mashayikh Lepidotonpolis, near Abydos. The tomb chapel is fully decorated and contains a long biographical inscription. According to this inscription he started his career on a ship, albeit it is not entirely clear what his exact position was there. Later he served in the army and was part of military campaigns. He was scribe of the army and chariotry. The inscription does not mention a king. However, it seems likely that the service in the army was under king Ramesses II, as the second part of career happened under Merenptah. The latter reigned only for about 10 years.Boyo G.

Leko, and according to a drawing of its founder and manager, professor Milan Nedeljković. Thanks to his efforts, the observatory was equipped with the latest measuring instruments. Its construction coincided with the emergence of these types of institution in the developed countries of Europe. The interest in meteorology in Serbia began in the mid-19th century. It is very likely that Vladimir Jakšić, professor at the Belgrade Lyceum and Advanced School, founder of statistics, was the first man who started to deal with meteorology in Serbia. After returning to Belgrade in 1847, having completed his education in Germany and Austria, he began to perform daily meteorological research and measurement in Belgrade. In his diaries meteorological observations, climatology and statistical work, Јakšić left valuable information on climate and hydrological phenomena of his time. In the eighties of the 19th century, the Department of Astronomy and Meteorology was established at the Advanced School. The arrival of Milan Nedeljković as the professor of astronomy and meteorology is one of the most important moments in the development of science in Serbia. \\"Milan Nedeljković, as a brilliant connoisseur of the then state of meteorology in the world and its great importance in the field of scientific activity, as well as in the development of various branches ofeconomic activity, developed tireless activity on the establishment of a modern observatory for meteorological and astronomical observations and tests and on the establishment and maintenance of systematic meteorological observations throughout the territory of Serbia, continuing the pioneering work of Vladimir Jakšić, his predecessor in this field.\\" The first task that was considered important by Milan Nedeljković was erecting an observatory and meteorological stations in Serbia. Due to his efforts, the Minister of Education decided to erect a provisional meteorological and astronomical observatory for the Kingdom of Serbia in a private house at Vračar in 1887. For this purpose, the house of G. Geisler at southwestern Vračar was used, now in number 63, Svetozar Marković Street. Milan Nedeljković continued to lead live action to raise a permanent observatory of the Advanced School, so the land for its erecting was obtained from the Belgrade municipality, on the highest point at Western Vračar. Another important thing that had to be solved after acquiring land was to raise the building. To this end, the Ministry of Education sent the drawing of the building to the Ministry of Construction, i.e. architectural department of this ministry, pursuing the efforts of Milan Nedeljković, and the department drew up a detailed plan of the building. The building was finally built in 1891 by the project of the аrchitect Dimitrije T. Leko. Carried out in the spirit of Romanticism, it was specially designed and built for the meteorological and аstronomical observations, which also caused its particular architectural design. Set freely in space, the building is conceived as a pavilion-type building, around which a park was formed. The main facade ends with tines that form the attic and the terrace railing, placed above a portion of the attic and the other facades end with stepped gables. The ground floor windows and the front door are arched. The facade decoration consists of window frames and bulged horizontal strips on the walls. Conservation and restoration works were completed in 1987–1988. The building of the meteorological observatory was built almost at the same time as in the developed countries of Europe. At the time of erection, it was the first building purposefully dedicated to meteorological and astronomical observations in Serbia. Meteorological Observatory trained the best personnel in the area, and as a pedagogical center, along with the Department of Meteorology and Astronomy at the Advanced School, provided a number of recognized and known experts. The historical significance of this building is multifaceted. First of all, the meteorological observatory represents the achievements of the society of its time. Taken as a whole, the building is a successful authorial, architectural achievement of Dimitrije T. Leko and a significant achievement of Serbian architecture. Because of its cultural- historical, social and architectural value, the building of the First Serbian Observatory in 8, Bulevar оslobođenja is declared as cultural property of exceptional importance in 1979. == See more == * List of cultural monuments in Belgrade == References  External links == * Cultural monuments in Serbia: Building of the first Serbian Observatory (website SANU) (in Serbian and English) * Historical heritage of Belgrade/Building of the First Serbian Observatory * Republic Institute for the Protection of Cultural Monuments – Belgrade * Republic Institute for the Protection of Cultural Monuments- Belgrade/Immovable cultural property base * List of monuments Category:Buildings and structures completed in 1891 Category:Buildings and structures in Belgrade Category:1891 establishments in Serbia Category:Savski Venac Category:Cultural Monuments of Great Importance (Serbia) ","title":"First Serbian Observatory"},{"id":"54133066","text":"The 2004–05 CERS Cup was the 25th season of the CERS Cup, Europe's second club roller hockey competition organized by CERH. 22 teams from five national associations qualified for the competition as a result of their respective national league placing in the previous season.

According to news reports published by the Shakhtar football club, the arena became known as the Arena of Mercy, and the center has helped save over 1 million people to date. Organisation's 2014 annual report of the Akhmetov Foundation showed that they had organised the evacuation of about 40,000 people from the conflict zone and distributed 1.35m food packages. The report also states that the Foundation espouses traditional humanitarian principles and values: ‘Our role is to fully comply with international humanitarian assistance principles that require efficiency, transparency, independence and strict neutrality’. In 2014, the Foundation's Rinat Akhmetov Humanitarian Center reported that it helped more than 710,000 people.

Alexander Vishnyakov, the director of the Rinat Akhmetov Humanitarian Center, on the press conference underlined that for 3 years of work, the Center saved more than 1 million civilians in the East of Ukraine from starvation disease and shelling and became the largest humanitarian mission in this territory. ==Major Humanitarian Programs== There are six main directions in the Center's healthcare work: targeted medical assistance, medical kits, cardiac care, medicines for children, rehabilitation of injured children, birth kits. Psychological support is one more direction that continue working trying to help all the civilians of Donetsk and Luhansk region. 250 psychologists were trained in the \\"War Trauma\\" course at the initiative of Rinat Akhmetov Humanitarian Center.

Over time, the Foundation has focused more and more on children's health, pregnant women, retired people or orphans - they became the priority. Rinat Akhmetov Foundation offers life- saving surgeries and urgent treatments especially for children, like Healthy Hearts, to provide a quick and effective response to crucial medical needs, or like a hearing aid programme. The Center provides pharmaceuticals as insulin, anticonvulsants and asthma medications to all children under 18, living in non-government-controlled areas of Donbas, and internally displaced children who left for the peaceful territories of Donetsk and Luhansk regions.https://brussels-express.eu/victims-war-ukraine-today-brussels/ In September 2019, 20 ambulances purchased by the Rinat Akhmetov Foundation were sent to the regions on the Day of Patient Safety at the initiative of President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky.\\"President's Office reported on transfer of ambulances to hospitals purchased for Akhmetov's funds \\" Bukvy, September 17, 2019 In general, the project, under which 200 ambulances, procured by the decision of Rinat Akhmetov, will be transferred to children's regional hospitals, ambulance stations and outpatient clinics of rural communities in all regions of Ukraine before the end of the year, was launched in June 2019.\\"Rinat Akhmetov Foundation handed over 57 out of 200 ambulances to doctors throughout Ukraine\\" Gordon, August 20, 2019 == Humanitarian Center performance assessment == The Overseas Development Institute has released a new report “Humanitarian access and local organisations in Ukraine” describing the needs and response of the main humanitarian assistance actors in Donbass, Ukraine. As the most active national foundation in preventing humanitarian catastrophe in the Ukraine, the Rinat Akhmetov Foundation was a major contributor to the humanitarian effort in the DPR until February 2017 when the de facto authorities closed down the foundation's network of distribution points. Local actors in the Ukraine were mainly organised civilian groups, but these local actors can not match the scale and scope of international humanitarian help. The one exception to this is the Rinat Akhmetov Foundation. Created by billionaire Rinat Akhmetov, the richest man in the Ukraine and one of Donbass' most prominent oligarchs, the Foundation has played a crucial role in providing aid for citizens, reacting early to the crisis and focusing on ‘hard’ activities such as the distribution of food and blankets.\\"New report details the work of EFC member Rinat Akhmetov Foundation and humanitarian actors in Ukraine\\" European Foundation Centre, September, 2017 After the ban of the Humanitarian Center's activities by the authorities of the Donetsk People's Republic in the territory under their control in March 2017, even Rinat Akhmetov's detractors acknowledged that his assistance was immense and indispensable, and the products from his Center actually helped the poorest inhabitants of Donetsk region to survive.\\"\\"Они тут гуляют, пьют, а мы сдыхаем без работы!

On December 5, 2006, ten years after the execution, Zhao Zhihong wrote the Petition of my Death Penalty admitting he had committed the crime. Huugjilt was posthumously exonerated and Zhao Zhihong was sentenced to death in 2015. Xinhua stated that the case was \\"one of the most notorious cases of judicial injustice in China in the recent decade.\\" Huugjilt, a Chinese Mongol, had only a single name. ==Crime== A woman surnamed Yang was raped and murdered inside a public toilet in a Hohhot textile factory, on April 9, 1996. The woman had been fatally strangled. Huugjilt had discovered the body and alerted authorities, but he was arrested and accused of committing the crime. ==Trial and execution of Huugjilt== The original trial operated on the grounds that Huugjilt had confessed to the crime. The confession occurred within 48 hours. Hohhot authorities stated that there was a quota of criminal cases to conclude, and that this influenced the treatment of Huugjilt. In an opinion article about the case, the China Daily stated \\"It has not been rare for higher authorities to exert pressure on local public security departments and judiciary to crack serious murder cases. Nor has it been rare for the police to extort confessions through torture. And suspects have been sentenced without solid evidence except for extorted confessions.\\" (Opinion) Huugjilt was held for 61 days. 18 at the time of his conviction, he was sentenced to death on May 23, 1996. He was executed by firing squad, \\\\- Updated 16 December 2014 - Print title: \\"Court 'sorry' for wrongful execution\\" on June 10 of that year; he was 18 at the time of his death. ==Zhao Zhihong's confession== Several media reports released after the execution stated that the court system used incorrect information, and several legal experts concurred with this thesis. Zhao Zhihong, who had committed thirteen rapes of women and girls and murders of ten individuals from 1996 to 2005, confessed to killing Yang in 2005. The Chinese justice system determined Zhao had committed a total of 21 crimes. He was originally scheduled to be tried for killing nine women and girls in late 2006, but this trial was adjourned and pushed back to November 2014. On January 5, 2015, Zhao's trial by the Hohhot Intermediate People's Court commenced. On Monday February 9, 2015, Zhao received a death sentence, was asked to pay 102,768 renminbi to the victims, had all political rights removed forever, and received a fine of 53,000 renminbi ($8,464 U.S. dollars). ==Exoneration and aftermath== After Zhao's confession, Huugjilt's parents demanded that the court system revisit the murder case so Huugjilt may be exonerated. The retrial of Huugjilt in the High People's Court of Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region took place from November through December 2014, concluding with his exoneration. It was partially on the grounds that in his confession he did not properly recount the crime, nor the physical description and accent of Yang. The deputy president of the court, Zhao Jianping (赵建平), gave 30,000 renminbi ($37,960 Hong Kong dollars, $4,500 U.S. dollars) to Huugjilt's parents, Li Sanren and Shang Aiyun. Both Li and Shang received 2,059,621.4 million renminbi ($332,116 U.S. dollars, or over £220,000 British pounds) in compensation from the Higher People's Court of Inner Mongolia, making up for the length of Huugilt's detention, his death, the loss experienced by Li and Shang, and the costs of the funeral. Hugjilt's family took a copy of the exoneration notice to his gravesite and burned it there as a way of telling him that he had been exonerated. Inner Mongolia authorities sanctioned 27 government officials as a result of the wrongful execution. Feng Zhiming (冯志明), the Hohhot Public Security Bureau Xincheng District branch head, was blacklisted, and he had the possibility of being criminally tried. Charges include accepting bribery, dereliction of duty, and gaining confessions by using torture. The others received demerits and other administrative sanctions. They included ten other officials from the Hohhot PSB, three officials from the Hohhot intermediate people's court and the region higher people's court, as well as ex-chief procurator Wen Da and six other officials of the Hohhot people's procuratorate. Li and Shang believed the punishments for the officials were too lenient. According to Beijing Foreign Studies University professor of journalism Zhan Jiang, the public sympathised with Huugjilt since he was young at the time of his death. The Huugjilt case became a commonly-discussed topic on Sina Weibo, with lawyers discussing the topic. ==ReferencesFurther reading== * Category:1977 births Category:1996 deaths Category:Wrongful executions Category:History of Inner Mongolia Category:People executed by China by firing squad Category:20th-century executions by China Category:Crime in China Category:Hohhot ","title":"Huugjilt"},{"id":"54133259","text":"FICTS (Federation Internationale Cinema Television Sportifs) is a Federation of Sport Televisions and of an images on screen.

It was created by researchers at London-based artificial intelligence firm DeepMind. The technique, outlined in a paper in September 2016, is able to generate relatively realistic-sounding human-like voices by directly modelling waveforms using a neural network method trained with recordings of real speech. Tests with US English and Mandarin reportedly showed that the system outperforms Google's best existing text-to-speech (TTS) systems, although as of 2016 its text-to-speech synthesis still was less convincing than actual human speech. WaveNet's ability to generate raw waveforms means that it can model any kind of audio, including music. ==History== Generating speech from text is an increasingly common task thanks to the popularity of software such as Apple's Siri, Microsoft's Cortana, Amazon Alexa and the Google Assistant. Most such systems use a variation of a technique that involves concatenated sound fragments together to form recognisable sounds and words. The most common of these is called concatenative TTS. It consists of large library of speech fragments, recorded from a single speaker that are then concatenated to produce complete words and sounds. The result sounds unnatural, with an odd cadence and tone. The reliance on a recorded library also makes it difficult to modify or change the voice. Another technique, known as parametric TTS, uses mathematical models to recreate sounds that are then assembled into words and sentences. The information required to generate the sounds is stored in the parameters of the model. The characteristics of the output speech are controlled via the inputs to the model, while the speech is typically created using a voice synthesiser known as a vocoder. This can also result in unnatural sounding audio. == Design and ongoing research==  Background  WaveNet is a type of feedforward neural network known as a deep convolutional neural network (CNN). In WaveNet, the CNN takes a raw signal as an input and synthesises an output one sample at a time. It does so by sampling from a softmax (i.e. categorical) distribution of a signal value that is encoded using μ-law companding transformation and quantized to 256 possible values.  Initial concept and results  According to the original September 2016 DeepMind research paper WaveNet: A Generative Model for Raw AudioOord et al. (2016). WaveNet: A Generative Model for Raw Audio, Cornell University, 19 September 2016, the network was fed real waveforms of speech in English and Mandarin. As these pass through the network, it learns a set of rules to describe how the audio waveform evolves over time. The trained network can then be used to create new speech-like waveforms at 16,000 samples per second. These waveforms include realistic breaths and lip smacks – but do not conform to any language. WaveNet is able to accurately model different voices, with the accent and tone of the input correlating with the output. For example, if it is trained with German, it produces German speech. The capability also means that if the WaveNet is fed other inputs – such as music – its output will be musical. At the time of its release, DeepMind showed that WaveNet could produce waveforms that sound like classical music.  Content (voice) swapping  According to the June 2018 paper Disentangled Sequential AutoencoderLi & Mand (2016). Disentangled Sequential Autoencoder, 12 June 2018, Cornell University, DeepMind has successfully used WaveNet for \\"content swapping\\" also in regards to audio and voice content, which basically means that the voice on any given audio recording can be swapped for any other pre- existing voice while maintaining the text and other features from the original recording. \\"We also experiment on audio sequence data. Our disentangled representation allows us to convert speaker identities into each other while conditioning on the content of the speech.\\" (p. 5) \\"For audio, this allows us to convert a male speaker into a female speaker and vice versa [...].\\" (p. 1) According to the paper, a two-digit minimum amount of hours (c. 50 hours) of pre-existing speech recordings of both source and target voice are required to be fed into WaveNet for the program to learn their individual features before it is able to perform the conversion from one voice to another at a satisfying quality. The authors stress that \\"[a]n advantage of the model is that it separates dynamical from static features [...].\\" (p. 8), i. e. WaveNet is capable of distinguishing between the spoken text and modes of delivery (modulation, speed, pitch, mood, etc.) to maintain during the conversion from one voice to another on the one hand, and the basic features of both source and target voices that it is required to swap on the other. The January 2019 follow-up paper Unsupervised speech representation learning using WaveNet autoencodersChorowsky et al. (2019). Unsupervised speech representation learning using WaveNet autoencoders, 25 January 2019, Cornell University details a method to successfully enhance the proper automatic recognition and discrimination between dynamical and static features for \\"content swapping\\", notably including swapping voices on existing audio recordings, in order to make it more reliable. Another follow-up paper, Sample Efficient Adaptive Text-to-SpeechChen et al. (2018). Sample Efficient Adaptive Text-to-Speech, 27 September 2018, Cornell University. Also see this paper's latest January 2019 revision., dated September 2018 (latest revision January 2019), states that DeepMind has successfully reduced the minimum amount of real-life recordings required to sample an existing voice via WaveNet to \\"merely a few minutes of audio data\\" while maintaining high-quality results. Its ability to clone voices has raised ethical concerns about WaveNet's ability to mimic the voices of living and dead persons. According to a 2016 BBC article, companies working on similar voice-cloning technologies (such as Adobe Voco) intend to insert watermarking inaudible to humans to prevent counterfeiting, while maintaining that voice cloning satisfying, for instance, the needs of entertainment- industry purposes would be of a far lower complexity and use different methods than required to fool forensic evidencing methods and electronic ID devices, so that natural voices and voices cloned for entertainment-industry purposes could still be easily told apart by technological analysis.Adobe Voco 'Photoshop-for-voice' causes concern, 7 November 2016, BBC ==Applications== At the time of its release, DeepMind said that WaveNet required too much computational processing power to be used in real world applications. As of October 2017, Google announced a 1,000-fold performance improvement along with better voice quality. WaveNet was then used to generate Google Assistant voices for US English and Japanese across all Google platforms.WaveNet launches in the Google Assistant In November 2017, DeepMind researchers released a research paper detailing a proposed method of \\"generating high- fidelity speech samples at more than 20 times faster than real-time\\", called \\"Probability Density Distillation\\".Oord et al. (2017): Parallel WaveNet: Fast High-Fidelity Speech Synthesis, Cornell University, 28 November 2017 At the annual I/O developer conference in May 2018, it was announced that new Google Assistant voices were available and made possible by WaveNet; WaveNet greatly reduced the number of audio recordings that were required to create a voice model by modeling the raw audio of the voice actor samples. == References  External links == * WaveNet: A Generative Model for Raw Audio Category:Speech synthesis Category:Artificial neural networks Category:Google acquisitions Category:Google ","title":"WaveNet"},{"id":"54133335","text":"In Greek mythology Linus ( Linos \\"flax\\") was a reputed musician and master of eloquent speech.Nonnus.

Iliad, Book 18.570-72. a form of dirge, which was sometimes seen as a lament for him. This would account for his being the son of Apollo and a Muse, and by which fact, Linus was also considered the inventor of melody and rhythm or of dirges (thrênoi) and songs in general. Thus, he was called \\"pantoiês sophiês dedaêkôs\\" by Hesiod. Either he or his brother Orpheus was regarded as the inventor of the harp; otherwise Linus was credited to be the first to use the harp accompanied with singing.Pliny the Elder. Natural History, Book 7.56.5 From his father Apollo, he received the three-stringed lute. During the Hellenistic period, Alexandrine grammarians even regarded Linus as a historical personage and according to a legend, he was known as the writer of apocryphal works in which he described exploits of the god Dionysus and other mythical legends. With these, he was among other mythical authors, like Musaeus and Orpheus, of Pelasgic writings.Diodorus Siculus. Bibliotheca Historica, Book 3.67.4 Diogenes Laertius ascribes to him several poetical productions, such as a cosmogony on the course of the sun and moon, on the generation of animals and fruits, and the like. His poem begins with the line: \\"Time was when all things grew up at once;..\\" == Mythology == Linus was said to have lived during the reign of Cadmus in Thebes and became important in the art of music along with Amphion and Zethus (1420 BC).Jerome. Chronicon, B1429 & B1420 In the Suda, Linus was said to have been the first to bring the alphabet from Phoenicia to the Greeks but Diodorus Siculus gives a different account. > \\"...when Cadmus brought from Phoenicia the letters, as they are called, > Linus was again the first to transfer them into the Greek language, to give > a name to each character, and to fix its shape. Now the letters, as a group, > are called \\"Phoenician\\" because they were brought to the Greeks from the > Phoenicians, but as single letters the Pelasgians were the first to make use > of the transferred characters and so they were called.\\"Diodorus Siculus. > Bibliotheca Historica, Book 3.67.1 The same author recounted that Marsyas was flayed by Apollo who broke the strings of the lyre as well as the harmony he had discovered. The harmony of the strings, however, was rediscovered, when the Muses added later the middle string, Linus struck the string with the forefinger, and Orpheus and Thamyras the lowest string and the one next to it.Diodorus Siculus. Bibliotheca Historica, Book 3.67.6 According to Hyginus, Linus won the contest of singing during the games for the Argives conducted by Acastus, son of Pelias.Hyginus. Fabulae 273  Versions of Death   by Apollo  According to Boeotian tradition, Apollo slew Linus with his arrows for being his rival in a musical contest (Linus' parentage here was described as the son of Urania and Amphimarus) and near Mount Helicon his image stood in a hollow rock, formed in the shape of a grotto.Pausanias. Description of Greece, 9.29.3; Eustathius. ad Homer, p.1163 Every year before sacrifices were offered to the Muses, a funeral sacrifice was offered to him, and dirges (linoi) were sung in his honour. His tomb was claimed both by the city of Argos and by Thebes.Pausanias. Description of Greece, Book 2.19.7 Chalcis in Euboea likewise boasted of possessing the tomb of Linus, the inscription of which is preserved by Diogenes Laertius. > \\"Here Linus, whom Urania bore, The fair-crowned Muse, > sleeps on a foreign shore.\\"Diogenes Laertius. Lives of the Eminent > Philosophers, Prologue 4 compare with Suidas, s.v. Linus  by Heracles  Linus also, who was admired because of his poetry and singing, had many pupils, and three of greatest renown, Heracles, Thamyris, and Orpheus. After he went to Thebes and became a Theban,Pseudo-Apollodorus. Bibliotheca, Book 2.4.9 he taught music as well as letters to the young Heracles.Suidas, s.v. Linus; Eusebius. Preparation of the Gospels, 10.11.2; Tatian. Address to the Greeks, 41 The boy, learning to play the lyre, was unable to appreciate what was taught him because of his sluggishness of soul. While Heracles was touching the instrument unmusically, Linus reprimanded him for making errors and punished him with rods. The pupil flew into a rage and violently struck his teacher with his own lyre.Aelian. Varia Historia, Book 3.32; Tzetzes. Chiliades When he was tried for murder, Heracles quoted a law of Rhadamanthys, who laid it down that whoever defends himself against a wrongful aggressor shall go free, and so he was acquitted. He was then sent by his mortal father, Amphitryon to tend his cowherds. A tale about the education of Heracles under Linus' tutelage was recorded by Athenaeus, in which he told of a play entitled Linus by the poet Alexis, > \\"... Alexis, poet tells in the play entitled Linus. He imagines Heracles as > being educated in the house of Linus and as having been bidden to select > from a large number of books lying beside him and read. So he picked up a > book on cookery and held it in both hands very carefully. Linus speaks: 'Go > up and take whatever book from there you wish; then looking very carefully > at the titles, quietly and at your leisure, you shall read.\\"Athenaeus. > Deipnosophists, 4.164 According to Pausanias, Linus' death was very prominent that mourning to him spread widely even to all foreign land that even Egyptians made a Linus song, in the language called Maneros. He also added that of the Greek poets, Homer shows that he knew of the sufferings of Linus were the theme of a Greek song when he says, that Hephaestus, among the other scenes he worked upon the shield of Achilles, represented a boy harpist singing the Linus song: 'In the midst of them a boy on a clear-toned lyre Played with great charm, and to his playing sang of beautiful Linus.Pausanias. Description of Greece, 9.29.7 Pausanias. Description of Greece, 9.29.7 ' It is probably owing to the difficulty of reconciling the different myths about Linus, that the ThebansPausanias. Description of Greece, 9.29.9 thought it necessary to distinguish between an earlier and later Linus; the earlier Linus who was killed by Apollo and the later who was said to have instructed Heracles in music, but to have been killed by the hero.compare Pseudo-Apollodorus. Bibliotheca, Book 2.4.9; Athenaeus. Deipnosophists, 4.164; Diodorus Siculus. Bibliotheca Historica, Book 3.67.1 & Theocritus. 24.103 == Interpretation == The principal places in Greece which are the scenes of the legends about Linus are Argos and Thebes, and the legends themselves bear a strong resemblance to those about Hyacinthus, Narcissus, Glaucus, Adonis, Maneros, and others, all of whom are conceived as handsome and lovely youths, and either as princes or as shepherds. They are the favourites of the gods; and in the midst of the enjoyment of their happy youth, they are carried off by a sudden or violent death; but their remembrance is kept alive by men, who celebrate their memory in dirges and appropriate rites, and seek the vanished youths generally about the middle of summer, but in vain. The feeling which seems to have given rise to the stories about these personages, who form a distinct class by themselves in Greek mythology, is deeply felt grief at the catastrophes observable in nature, which dies away under the influence of the burning sun (Apollo) soon after it has developed all its fairest beauties. Those popular dirges, therefore, originally the expression of grief at the premature death of nature through the heat of the sun, were transformed into lamentations of the deaths of youths, and were sung on certain religious occasions. They were afterwards considered to have been the productions of the very same youths whose memory was celebrated in them. The whole class of songs of this kind was called thrênoi oiktoi, and the most celebrated and popular among them was the linos, which appears to have been popular even in the days of Homer.Homer. Iliad, 18.569, with the Scholia Pamphos, the Athenian, and Sappho, sang of Linus under the name of Oetolinus (oitos Linou, i. e. the death of LinusPausanias. Description of Greece, 9.29.3); and the tragic poets, in mournful choral odes, often use the form ailinos.Aeschylus. Agamemnon, 121; Sophocles. Ajax, 627; Euripides. Phoenician women, 1535 & Orestes. 1380), which is a compound of at, the interjection, and Line. As regards the etymology of Linus, Welcker regards it as formed from the mournful interjection, li, while others, on the analogy of Hyacinthus and Narcissus, consider Linus to have originally been the name of a flower (a species of narcissus).Phot.

Linus was found by shepherds, who brought him up but the child after reaching adulthood was torn to pieces by the shepherd's dogs. Psamathe's grief at the occurrence betrayed her misfortune to her father, who would not believe that she had had intercourse with a god rather than a mortal, and thus condemned her to death. Apollo, in his indignation at the father's cruelty, visited Argos with a child-killing plague and when his oracle was consulted about the means of averting the plague, he answered that the Argives must propitiate Psamathe and Linus.Conon, Narrationes, 19 This was attempted by means of sacrifices, and matrons and virgins sang dirges which were called linoi, and the month in which this solemnity was celebrated was called arneios, and the festival itself arnis, because Linus had grown up among lambs. The pestilence, however, did not cease until Crotopus quitted Argos and settled at Tripodisium, in Megaris. In an alternate version, the baby Linus was torn apart by the king's sheepdogs upon being exposed and Apollo sent Poene, the personification of punishment, upon the city. Poene would steal children from their mothers until Coroebus killed her.Pausanias, Description of Greece, 1. 43. 7 This caused a second punishment to fall upon the city that was devastated by plague. == References == Category:Children of Apollo ==Sources== * Smith, William; Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, London (1873).

It is lined with the Mihailo Pupin Boulevard, Ušće and street Nikola Tesla Boulevard. It borders Veliko ratno ostrvo and Malo ratno ostrvo, and the city center of Belgrade through the Danube and the Sava River. Friendship Park covers an area of 14 hectares. It can be reached by local bus by bus lines 15ГСП линија 15 and 84.ГСП линија 84 ==Nature and sports facilities== The park includes a large number of green areas and trees and it leads to the river Sava and river Danube. It is suitable for walking, physical activity or relaxation in nature. The park also has a bike path and a running trail. Although located near the center of Belgrade, peace and quiet prevails in the park. Within the park, there is also Skate Park Ušće. ==Construction and history== The idea for the establishment of the Friendship Park of memorial character came from Young Gorani who, in the name of holding the first Conference of NAM in Belgrade in 1961, decided to establish a memorial park as a symbol of the struggle for peace and equality for all peoples in the world. On 29 August 1961, their initiative was supported by the Council for Culture and the Council for Urban Planning of the National Committee of the City of Belgrade. Тito’s planting plane trees on 7 September 1961 was considered the grand opening of the Park. The first preliminary design was done by engineer Vladeta Đorđević, but the final solution regarding the appearance and organization of park space is shown in the project called \\"Potez,\\" which won first prize at the Yugoslav competition in 1965. The Belgrade City Assembly and the committee on taking care of the construction and development of the park announced an all-Yugoslav competition.Завршен конкурс за идејни пројекат „Парка пријатељства“, Борба, 17.12.1965. године; Додељене награде за урбанистичко решење...Политика, 17.12.1965. године The specificity of the subject matter was a challenge to the authors since it treated the field of horticulture, not so frequent competition matter, and the position of the park among the most important government buildings, the Palace of the Federal Executive Council and the former building of the CK CPY (today BC Ušće), Museum of Contemporary Art and Hotel Yugoslavia. Nineteen works took part in the competition, of which three were awarded and eleven were purchased. The first prize was won by the work under the code \\"Potez\\" by the architect Milan Pališaški. The second prize was shared by the architects Ranko Radović and Ljiljana Pekić, and the third prize went to the architect Mira Holambek-Bencler from Zagreb. The construction of the park was symbolically marked the establishment of the Non-Aligned Movement, one of the whose founders was Yugoslavia. The work of the architect Pališaški, according to the selection panel, was a strict geometric solution with geometrical divisions and monumental size, ceremonial and representative.Извештај и мишљење оцењивачког суда (жирија) о приспелим радовима за израду идејног решења за изградњу и уређење „Парка пријатељства“ у Новом Београду, Београд, 16.12.1965. године.

The park features a flower statue of the sculptor Lidija Mišić. Peace Avenue with 26 plane trees that were planted by statesmen, during a conference of the NAM in Belgrade until 1989, is 180 m long, which also represents the number of countries which had a commitment to peace as their political priority, through the so-called policy of peaceful, active coexistence. All participants of the First Conference planted the same plant – plane tree. The selection of plane trees is their longevity, which emphasizes the idea of establishing a lasting peace in the world. Next to each planted tree is a tablet with the name of the statesman and the country of origin, year of planting, and the denomination of the tree Platanus acerofilia. Plane tree seedlings are placed at a distance of eight meters so that they could merge at a certain height of their growth and thus form a unique green series which also symbolizes of the connection of all nations through a common idea. From the competition solution to today, only 9.5 hectares of park area have been realized. Although little has been done out of the original idea of the architect Pališaški ,Изведена је само главна алеја и интерне стазе у источном делу парка, док је западни део зелена површина која се данас користи за одржавање концерата и културних дешавања. specificity in the formation of a modern park is basically considered even today.Досије споменика културе парк пријатељстав – Документациони центар завода за заштиту споменика културе града Београда ==Monument “Eternal Flame“== The Eternal Flame memorial is located in the park and is dedicated to the military and civilian victims of the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia. Largely conceived by Mirjana Marković, the leader of the Yugoslav Left and wife of Yugoslav president Slobodan Milošević. It was originally planned to have a height of 78 meters, to symbolize the 78 days of the bombing. The monument was unveiled on June 12, 2000, to commemorate the first anniversary of the end of the bombing. It was vandalized following the overthrow of Slobodan Milošević and was in a state of ruin for several years. ==Famous people in the park== In this park, numerous officials and celebrities planted a tree as a sign of friendship, and among them were the following: Francois Mitterrand, Јоsip Broz Tito, Jawaharlal Nehru, Gamal Abdel Nasser, Queen Elizabeth II, Fidel Castro, Мuammar Gaddafi, Emperor Haile Selassie, Leonid Brezhnev, Mikhail Gorbachev, Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Todor Živkov, Nicolae Ceausescu , Kim Il Sung, Indira Gandhi and others.Пријатељи стари, где сте? („Вечерње новости“, 5. септембар 2014) The last official who planted a tree during the existence of the Socialist Federative Republic of Yugoslavia was the Romanian President Ion Iliesku, who planted the 194th tree in the park in 1991. Even after the breakup of Yugoslavia, the tradition of planting trees in the park was maintained, so the members of the Rolling Stones planted trees in 2007, before their concert in Belgrade. ==Gallery == Večna vatra.jpgMonument “Eternal Flame” Spomen obelezje pocetka gradnje N Beograda.jpgMemorial of the beginning of construction of New Belgrade Novi_Beograd_-_The_SIV_building.jpg  Palace of Serbia Park prijateljstva.jpegFriendship Park == See also== * Palace of Serbia * Non-Aligned Movement * Yugoslavia and the Non-Aligned Movement == References== Category:Parks in Belgrade Category:New Belgrade ","title":"Park of Friendship, New Belgrade"},{"id":"54133357","text":"FC Breukelen is a football club from Breukelen, Netherlands.

The rest are convex, separated by a linear, undulating, somewhat thickened suture. The body whorl which exceeds 2/3 of the total height, is globular in its upper part, attenuating slightly below its middle to end with an elongation in a very short siphonal canal. The aperture is oblique, narrow and has a continuous peristome. The columella, concave in its upper part, is coated with an enamel whose edge rises in a blunt crest. Starting at this ridge, pointing inwards, are 8 folds regularly spaced along the length. The outer lip is convex, strongly thickened; Its sharp edge is not prominent. The folds in the interior protrude in the form of strong denticles. The almost round sinus is dug a little below the suture in the callosity of the outer lip.Hervier, J. 1898.

This should take careful account of: * most importantly, consultation with the users of the data * any available specification of the system which will use the data to perform the analysis * a full understanding of the information available, and any gaps, in the source data. See also Data definition specification. ==Example== Suppose there is a two-character alphabetic field which indicates geographical location. It is possible that in one data source a code \\"EE\\" means \\"Europe\\" and in another data source the same code means \\"Estonia\\". One would need to devise an unambiguous set of codes and amend the code in one set of records accordingly. Furthermore, the \\"geographical area\\" might refer to any of e.g. delivery address, billing address, address from which goods supplied, billing currency, or applicable national regulations. All these matters must be covered in the specification. There could be some records with \\"X\\" or \\"555\\" in that field. Clearly, this is invalid data as it does not conform to the specification. If there are only small numbers of such records, one would either correct them manually or if precision is not important, simply delete those records from the file. Another possibility would be to create a \\"not known\\" category. ==Other examples of invalid data requiring correction== * Telephone numbers are in the correct format and have the correct values for the territory indicated in the geographical location field. The country code may be present in some records and not in others: it should either be removed or inserted (based on the geographical location) depending on the data specification. Similarly, the formats of dates and units of measurement (weights, lengths) may be inconsistent. * In some cases missing data should be supplied from external sources (e.g. finding the Zip/Postal code of an address via an external data source) * Data should be consistent between different but related data records (e.g. the same individual might have different birthdates in different records or datasets). Where possible and economic, data should be verified against an authoritative source (e.g. business information is referenced against a D&B; database to ensure accuracy) The Five Step Data Cleansing ProcessData Preparation Article Given the variety of data sources (e.g. databases, business applications) that provide data and formats that data can arrive in, data preparation can be quite involved and complex. There are many tools and technologiesKDNuggets tools poll that are used for data preparation. The cost of cleaning the data should always be balanced against the value of the improved accuracy. == Self-service data preparation == Traditional tools and technologies, such as scripting languages or ETL and Data Quality tools are not meant for business users. They typically require programming or IT skills that most business users don’t have. A number of companies, such as Paxata, Trifacta, Alteryx, Talend, and Ataccama provide visual interfaces that display the data and allow the user to directly explore, structure, clean, augment, and update sample data provided by the user. Once the preparation work is complete, the underlying steps can be run on other datasets to perform the same operations. This reuse provides a significant productivity boost when compared to more traditional manual and hand-coding methods for data preparation. ==See also== * Data editing, correcting errors in a corpus of data * Data pre-processing, a step of cleaning data in data mining for analysis purposes * Data mining, finds patterns and insights within data sets * Data transmission ==References== Category:Computer occupations Category:Data mapping ","title":"Data preparation"},{"id":"54133484","text":"The 2017 Tour of Belgium, known as the 2017 Baloise Belgium Tour for sponsorship purposes, was the 87th edition of the Tour of Belgium cycling stage race.

Although the concept of the building was realized in a traditional way, using the tripartite division of facades, the processing of the main facade indicates the penetration of the new Art Nouveau architecture. Verticalism of the front facade facing the market is realized by three-part windows of the floors, which is overhung by an arched аttic with a pyramidal dome in the area of the roof. The central motif of the decorative treatment of façade is the motif of a woman's head with a shell and garlands in the semicircular tympanum field of the first floor. The side facades were enlivened by balconies of wrought iron, which are dominated by geometric and floral motifs. The ground floor was devoted to shops and the flats to representative housing. Vučo's House is a contribution to the development of the former Mali pijac on the river Sava, and it points to an interesting relationship investor – designer which was unique in Belgrade architecture in which all buildings of Vučo Family are designed by the architect Dimitrije T. Leko and represent Art Nouveau style. During the 19th century in this region, there were estates and houses of prominent citizens of Belgrade, such as Аntule, Vuče, Stojanović and others. The house of Ljubomir Krsmanović in 1894 and hotel \\"Bosna\\" were around Mali pijac. During bombing in the Second World War, the building was partially damaged. Repairs were made by the project in 1946. == References  External links == * Republic Institute for the Protection of Cultural Monuments – Belgrade * Republic Institute for the Protection of Cultural Monuments-Belgrade/Immovable cultural property base * List of monuments Category:Buildings and structures in Belgrade Category:Art Nouveau architecture in Belgrade Category:Art Nouveau apartment buildings Category:Savski Venac ","title":"Vučo's House on the Sava River"},{"id":"54133543","text":"Vibeke Vasbo (born 1944) is a Danish writer and women's rights and LGBT rights activist. In the early 1970s, she participated in the Redstocking movement and shortly afterwards in the Danish Lesbian Movement. She embarked on her literary career in 1976 with Al den løgn om kvinders svaghed (All those Lies about Women's Weakness) expanding on the work of a woman crane driver, based on her own experiences in Oslo in 1974-75. ==Biography== Born on 9 July 1944 on the Danish island of Als, she was the daughter of the medical doctors Harald Eyvind Roesdahl (1912–94) and Anna Helene Refslund Thomsen (born 1912). The second youngest of four children (three girls and one boy), she grew up in an old farmhouse in Tandslet where her parents had their practices. As a child, she was strongly influenced by her maternal grandmother, the author and politician Ingeborg Refslund Thomsen (1891–1972), spending much of her time at Brundlund Manor, her grandparent's home in Åbenrå. A creative child, she dreamt of becoming a journalist, writing short stories and poems. After matriculating from highschool in Sønderborg, she spent half a year as an au pair in Cambridge, England, improving her command of English. On her return to Denmark, she studied German and English at the University of Copenhagen. Participating in political student life, she met Karen Syberg with whom she set up Rødstrumperne, a small group based on the American feminist movement Redstockings, which soon developed into the Danish Redstocking Movement. A demonstration in central Copenhagen in 1970 ended with the women discarding their bras with a banner declaring Hold Danmark ren (Keep Denmark Clean). Further activities in support of women followed, including the creation of a \\"Women's Camp\\" on the island of Femø and a call for abortion rights in 1970. Vasbo abandoned her university studies in 1973, becoming a medical assistant in Bispebjerg Hospital. Many of the members of the Redstocking Movement were either already lesbians or decided to adopt lesbian ways. Vasbo, who had undergone a short period of marriage, was among them. In the face of opposition to lesbianism by many of the Redstocking members, the Lesbian Movement (Lesbisk Bevægelse) was established in 1974, soon enjoying a membership of 200 activists. Together with the Norwegian activist, Gerd Brantenberg, who had become her partner, Vasbo moved to Oslo where she worked as a crane driver. On the basis of diary notes, she wrote Al den løgn on kvinders svaghed, published in Danish and Norwegian in 1976 and later in German, describing how a woman could take up a job traditionally reserved for men. It was the first Danish book which openly described a woman's experiences from a lesbian viewpoint. Vasbo broke off her contacts with the Lesbian Movement in 1981 when she met a Danish priest, Leo Thomsen, in Italy. She developed a difficult relationship with him which ended in a separation a month before his death in 1998. Their romance was described in Miraklet i Amalfi (The Miracle in Amalfi), bringing Vasbo renewed attention. She went on to write a historic novel set in 7th-century England, Hildas sang (Hilda's Song, 1991), combining family life and sex. It was warmly welcome by the critics. ==Selected works== * 1976: Al den løgn om kvinders svaghed * 1980: Efterårsferie ved fjorden, short stories * 1980: Måske har jeg haft en anelse, poetry * 1981: Sygehjælper i æbletræernes blomstringstid, short stories * 1982: Den enøjede killing, short stories * 1984: Miraklet i Amalfi, novel * 1985: Anna-Amanda, short stories * 1990: Det er det, jeg siger: Man vil begå mord!, short stories * 1991: Hildas sang, historisk roman fra 600´årenes England, novel * 1993: Glæden ved at kigge ud ad vinduet, essay * 2004: Artemis, beretningen om en kat * 2008: Der mangler en sang om solsorten, novel * 2018: The Song of Hild, English translation of Hildas sang (translated by Gaye Kynoch) ==References== Category:1944 births Category:Living people Category:People from Sønderborg Municipality Category:20th-century Danish novelists Category:Danish women writers Category:LGBT writers from Denmark Category:LGBT rights activists from Denmark Category:Lesbian feminists Category:Lesbian writers Category:Danish expatriates in Norway Category:20th- century women writers ","title":"Vibeke Vasbo"},{"id":"54133551","text":"Blackball Universe is an Oakland, California-based multimedia collective founded by Fantastic Negrito and Malcolm Spellman to serve as support for struggling black artists.

What a Life is set in Central High School, with action primarily occurring in the principal's office.

He also has to deal with a student who bullies him. The play was copyrighted on July 7, 1936, under the title Enter to Learn. After some revisions, \\"without, however, materially changing the plot or principal characters\\", the title was changed to What a Life.

The Blue Tea would later change its name to the Ladies Literary Club. She was an anti-polygamy crusader who helped form and was the vice president of the Anti-Polygamy Society of Utah. Froiseth published the Anti- Polygamy Standard which lasted three years and later edited The Women of Mormonism, a book which described in detail the experiences of some Mormon women inside polygamous marriages. She believed strongly in women's rights and played a role in bringing enfranchisement to Utah Territory, later she became the vice president of the Utah Women's Suffrage Association. Although a strong supporter of female suffrage, she believed Mormon women should not have the right to vote until polygamy was eradicated. ==Early life== Born in Ireland, Froiseth came to the United States with her family and lived in New York. In 1866, Froiseth traveled to Europe with her brother, Colonel Finley Anderson, and her mother, Sarah Strong Anderson. During the five years Froiseth spent abroad studying in Europe, authors Charles Dickens, Robert Browning, and William Makepeace Thackeray were guests of the Anderson home. After returning to the United States in 1870, she traveled to the Utah Territory with Finley, who was on special assignment for the New York Herald in the West. In Utah, the siblings resided at Fort Douglas, where she met Bernard Arnold Martin Froiseth. Bernard and Jennie were married in the Holy Trinity Church in Brooklyn, New York, on June 8, 1871. Bernard was an army surveyor assigned to the Utah Territory, and soon after their wedding they returned to the West. ==The Blue Tea== In the late 19th century, Utah Territory was heavily populated by Mormons and dominated religiously and politically by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS church). The church held great sway over Mormon voters and people outside of the LDS church had very little political representation. Non-Mormons (at the time called \\"Gentiles\\") were effectively segregated; for example a non-Mormon woman had few ways to meet other women, whereas the women of the LDS Church could build friendships at the Relief Society. Froiseth struggled with the lack of social engagement. During a visit to family and friends back in New York City in 1875, Froiseth attended the Sorosis Women's club with her sister Julia. The experience Froiseth had at the club motivated her to form a literary club called the Blue Tea in Salt Lake City. It was Utah's first women's club. As the Blue Tea's first president, Froiseth set a cap of 25 members in 1876. The Blue Tea discussed many topics for the purpose of stimulating \\"mental culture\\" within its members. A few women would be assigned to read a book or article and come back the next week to expound on the ideas they read so the club could debate those ideas. Froiseth described the Blue Tea's first year: \\"we did good work, had some fine programmes, necessitating not a little reading and study, and the meetings went so well that there was rarely a vacant chair\\". Froiseth's club gave non-Mormon women the chance to socialize but also empowered them to push for change within their society. The minutes for the Blue Tea can be found in the Special Collections of the Marriott Library, University of Utah. ==Anti-polygamy movement== The Anti-Polygamy Society The Carrie Owen case moved Froiseth and other members of the Blue Tea to protest at Independence Hall in Salt Lake City on November 7, 1878. That same day, the women of the protest organized the Ladies' Anti-Polygamy Society of Utah; Sarah Anne Cooke was named president with Froiseth as vice president. The society's purpose \\"was not to wage war against any party, sect, or person, but...to fight to the death that system which so enslaves and degrades our sex, and which robs them of so much happiness\\". In August 1880 the Women's National Anti-Polygamy Society was founded, and Froiseth toured the country to give lectures on polygamy and to set-up Anti-Polygamy chapters. The Anti- Polygamy Society of Utah later would develop into the Utah Association for the Advancement of Women. The Anti-Polygamy Standard Froiseth's passionate opposition to polygamy led her to edit and publish The Anti-Polygamy Standard in 1880. The eight-page monthly paper has the same biblical verse printed on every issue, \\"Let every man have his own wife, and let every women have her own husband\\" (1 Corinthians 7:2). The Standard told the stories of women suffering in polygamous marriages and further educated the country on polygamy in the Utah Territory. The Anti-Polygamy Standard only lasted three years, ending abruptly in 1883 due to lack of funding. During the newspaper's life Froiseth compiled the stories of suffering women in polygamous marriages in order to publish The Women of Mormonism: Or, The story of polygamy as told by the victims themselves. The book focuses on the misery and distress felt by wives subjected to polygamy. One reverend wrote, \\"I have read some of the proof sheets of The Women of Mormonism. If the statements made are true—and they are amply vouched for by intelligent and trustworthy persons—they will certainly stir the blood of those who read them.\\" Froiseth wanted women from all over the United States to know what was happening in Utah Territory. Suffragist movement Utah held intensely liberal views of women's suffrage and also a strong dedication to polygamy. To the people in the East, women's suffrage was seen as the opposite of polygamy. For many, the two ideals could not coincide because polygamy was seen as oppressive to women. Hamilton Wilcox, a New York suffragist (1867–1868), suggested women's suffrage should be experimented with in the territories. People on the east coast were heavily motivated to push women's enfranchisement in Utah Territory, believing it would put an end to polygamy. By 1870, the idea became so popular and supported in the East that Utah territorial legislature began debate over the right of women to vote. On February 10, 1869, after two weeks of debate, a unanimous vote passed a bill enfranchising the women of Utah, fifty years before the Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution guaranteed women nationwide the right to vote. However, instead of voting against plural marriage, Mormon women helped double the majority in favor of plural marriage by reelecting William H. Hooper, who defended polygamy. Froiseth, a long time believer in the enfranchisement of women and later the vice president of the Utah Women's Suffrage Association (1888), firmly believed Mormon women should not have the right to vote—at least until polygamy was outlawed. She recognized this was inconsistent with her beliefs about women's rights but concluded, by her own judgement, that Mormon women were too heavily influenced to make voting decisions for themselves. ==Later years== The anti-polygamy Edmunds–Tucker Act passed in 1887, nine years after the organization of The Anti-Polygamy Society. In 1911, Froiseth organized a retirement home for women. She purchased the property and oversaw the architectural plans. The building was named the Sarah Daft Home and 100 years later it was still running as a retirement center. Froiseth became the president of the Sarah Daft Home and also worked with the Orphan's Home and Day Nursery. In her later years, Froiseth was an active member of the Poetry Society and served as its president. Froiseth's daughters, Ethylene and Dorothy, became members of the all-encompassing Ladies Literary Club, which took the place of the exclusive Blue Tea. As Froiseth put it, \\"the larger scope of the Ladies Literary Club\\" had discontinued the Blue Tea. Both of her daughters served for a time as president of the Ladies Literary Club. Froiseth's husband Bernard died on November 5, 1922. After living as a widow for eight years, Jennie Anderson Froiseth died at the age of 80 on February 7, 1930, 40 years after polygamy publicly ended. She had five children: Bernard Froiseth, R.J. Froiseth, R.E. Froiseth, Ethylene Perkins, and Dorothy Bracken. ==ReferencesExternal links== *Jenni Anderson Froiseth letters, MSS 3875 at L. Tom Perry Special Collections, Harold B.

Voters chose five representatives, or electors to the Electoral College, who voted for president and vice president. Rhode Island voted for the Democratic nominee, Governor Alfred E. Smith of New York, over the Republican nominee, Secretary of Commerce Herbert Hoover of California. Smith's running mate was Senator Joseph Taylor Robinson of Arkansas, while Hoover's running mate was Senate Majority Leader Charles Curtis of Kansas. Smith won Rhode Island by a very narrow margin of 0.61%, making him the first Democratic presidential candidate since Woodrow Wilson in 1912 to carry the state, as well as the first to win an absolute majority of the vote since Franklin Pierce in 1852 (Wilson won the state in 1912, but only with a 39.04% plurality due to Republican vote splitting between President William Howard Taft and his immediate predecessor, Theodore Roosevelt, who challenged him with a third party). Although Hoover won more counties than Smith, key to Smith's victory were his appeal to \\"ethnic white\\" Roman Catholic voters in Providence County and Bristol County. Rhode Island was the only state save adjacent Massachusetts (another state with a large Catholic population) outside the Democratic \\"Solid South\\" that voted for Smith in 1928. As Hoover became president in a nationwide electoral landslide, he became the first Republican elected president who did not carry Rhode Island. Given the scale of Hoover's win, Rhode Island was 18 percentage points more Democratic than the United States at large. Beginning in 1928, Rhode Island would transition from a strongly Yankee Republican state into a Democratic-leaning state. Since then, Republicans have only carried the state four times. Rhode Island would not vote for another Republican presidential candidate until Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1952. ==ResultsSee also== * United States presidential elections in Rhode Island ==References== Rhode Island 1928 Category:1928 Rhode Island elections ","title":"1928 United States presidential election in Rhode Island"},{"id":"54133672","text":"The Billingsley-Hills House, also known as the Veatch Residence, is a historic building located in Iowa City, Iowa, United States.

In the 1480s she is mentioned as married. She came to notice when her husband Richard Mellers died in 1507. He left substantial bequests to her, their three children and many good causes. He had manufactured bells and he had been the Mayor of Nottingham twice. Agnes set out to found a school in Nottingham and she got support from Sir Thomas Lovell.

By its volume and architectural features, the building is an established cultural property and has the status of a monument of culture. The name \\"Saint Sava\\" House is printed on the attic, on the main facade, above the middle of the avant-corps, which was designed by Dimitrije Naumović, Belgrade brazier, at his own expense. Society of Saint Sava, also known as the St. Sava Society, founded in 1886 with the task of spreading education and national feeling of the people, raised the building of the St. Sava Building in 1890, intended for the storage of bodies and institutions of the society, designed by architect Jovan Ilkić. On 10 August 1889, the foundation stone was laid. The Company collected financial and material resources for the construction through contributions, organizing lotteries, organizing parties and loans. Therefore, the Company also issued appeals. It sent letters to wealthy citizens. The press also helped by publishing and printing of various inscriptions with recommendations addressed to the patriotic public to that effect. Immediately after the opening ceremony of the building in 1890, the Management of the Company moved in, closely followed by the Saint Sava School and the Boarding School for Alumni of the Belgrade Trade Youth. Once, this building housed the state archives, school for the deaf of the Stefan Dečanski Society, First Belgrade Grammar School and others. Architect John Ilkić, in addition to drafting a plan and a bill, exercised construction supervision as well. St. Sava House is designed as a two-storey building with basement and ground floor. While the general concept of the building and the symmetrical composition of its main facade is based on academic principles, the facade is designed in the spirit of Romanticism, with elements of neo renaissance. The straight composed facade canvas is accented by the shallow central avant- corps, which finishes with an attic with a pyramidal dome in the area of the roof. The windows of the floors, designed as a two-light windows with arches, rely on cordon cornices, giving a romantic note to the entire facade. At the end of construction, the investor paid careful attention to the aesthetic appearance, decorations of the facade and interior furniture. Coats of arms of South Slavic countries in the lunettes above the windows of the first floor were carved by Jovan Heinrich Noken after the drawings by the painter Đoka Jovanović. In the First World War, the building was used by the occupying authorities. Many things were taken away. With some changes in the appearance of the upper part of the main facade, a third floor was added to the building in 1923, designed by architect Petar Bajalović. == External links== *Republic Institute for the Protection of Cultural Monuments – Belgrade *List of monuments *Republic Institute for the Protection of Cultural Monuments- Belgrade/Immovable cultural property base == References == Category:Buildings and structures in Belgrade ","title":"Saint Sava House"},{"id":"54133819","text":"Eduardo Enrique Fereira Peñaranda (born 29 September 2000) is a Venezuelan professional footballer player who plays as defender for Caracas FC in Venezuelan Primera División. ==References== Category:2000 births Category:Living people Category:Venezuelan footballers Category:Venezuelan Primera División players Category:Caracas FC players Category:Association football defenders ","title":"Eduardo Fereira"},{"id":"54133820","text":"Euryentmema australiana is a small sea snail, a marine gastropod mollusk in the family Mangeliidae.WoRMS (2009).

He is known for his work in films like Talvar, Commando 2: The Black Money Trail, Baaghi, Phantom, Hindi Medium and Aligarh. ==Early life== Sumit Gulati was born in Delhi, India and was raised in Geeta Colony. Right from his school days, Sumit, who has been working in Jhumroo for the past four years, showed more inclination towards theatre than studies. While in school, he attended the Theatre in Education programme run by the National School of Drama. He also joined amateur theatre troupes when he was in Class IX. Financial constraints meant that Delhi's Sumit Gulati, the actor who plays Kanhaiya, the compounder in Talvar, had to drop out even from the correspondence course he was pursuing and take up a job. But his love for acting made him feel suffocated at work, which he left in a short while, making everyone say, 'Iss ladke se kuch nahi hoga.' But today, the 25-year-old from East Delhi's Geeta Colony has been part of films like Bhaag Milkha Bhaag, Phantom and Talvar, and will be seen in Hansal Mehta's next film.

In February 2016, it was named the UK's \\"most diverse\\" road in a research project by the London School of Economics (LSE). ==History== Victorian housing in Narborough Road Narborough Road is a 1.5 mile (2.4 km)-long road in the south-west of Leicester. It stretches from Braunstone Lane in the south to Hinckley Road in the north, and is located in Westcotes, a ward of Leicester with a population () of 11,644. It is one of the main roads leading from the M1 motorway to the city centre. According to the 2015 Index of Multiple Deprivation, Narborough Road is located within areas that are among the 10–20% most deprived in England. Narborough Road was previously the main route from Leicester to the nearby city of Coventry. In 1485, Richard III rode south down the street towards Market Bosworth for the Battle of Bosworth against Henry Tudor; the street was crowded with people wanting to see him and cheer him off. After Richard lost the battle, his naked body was put on a horse and ridden back along the same route. In the mid-20th century, Narborough Road was closer to being a residential area; it then became a fashion street, with its retail units mainly selling clothes and fabrics. The opening of a number of restaurants and bars brought in students from the city's two universities, University of Leicester and De Montfort University. , 204 of the 222 units along the street (92%) are non-residential. ==Diversity== In 2015, a research project titled \\"Super Diverse Streets\\", funded by the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC), was undertaken by the LSE. Led by urban ethnographer Suzanne Hall, the project sought to \\"explore how urban retail economies and spaces are shaped by and shape migrant practices\\". Four streets were selected to be studied by the project: Rookery Road in Birmingham, Stapleton Road in Bristol, Cheetham Hill in Manchester, and Narborough Road. These four streets were selected for their ethnic diversity and their deprived urban locale. After surveying a sample of shopkeepers from each of the four streets, the project concluded that Narborough Road's 108 surveyed proprietors came from a total of 22 countries of birth, over four continents. The street was thus named the most diverse in the UK. The sampled shopkeepers observed that the ethnic make-up of the street had changed quickly. Tajinder Reehal, a Kenyan- born owner of an accessories shop, remarked: \\"I've seen the street change in the past 16 years. ... It's much more vibrant.\\" Hairdresser Dipak Maru, also Kenyan-born, agreed, and felt that \\"in the last ten years [the road has] become lively and vibrant\\". The researchers observed that, despite its high levels of economic deprivation, the high levels of diversity in the street had enabled business owners to trade skills with one another – for example, a Canadian couple who ran a book shop helped others with filling in forms in exchange for a free meal or a free haircut. Speaking about the street's community, half-English, half-Polish music shop owner Lloyd Wright noted: \\"There's no tension. It's a very relaxed atmosphere.\\" As a result of the conclusions of the project, in July 2016 the TV channel Channel 4 invited some of the shopkeepers of Narborough Road to provide voiceovers for announcements for their programmes. A total of 21 residents and shopkeepers were invited to provide announcements, which took four days to record. These announcements were broadcast on Channel 4 during the week beginning 23 July. ==References== Footnotes Sources * Category:Multiculturalism in the United Kingdom Category:Roads in Leicester Category:Streets in England ","title":"Narborough Road"},{"id":"54133943","text":"Wyatt Beazley Durrette, Jr. (born February 21, 1938) is an American attorney and Republican politician, who served three terms in the Virginia House of Delegates.Cynthia Miller Leonard, Virginia's General Assembly 1619-1978 (Richmond: Virginia State Library 1978) pp. 759, 766, 773 ==Early and family life== Born in Richmond, Virginia on February 21, 1938, Durrette (technically Wyatt Durrette Jr.) was raised in Franklin, Virginia, and attended an all- white high school during Massive Resistance.

Founded on May 23, 1899 in Albany, New York, its founding president was Ashbel P. Fitch and it was initially located in the Singer Building in Manhattan's Financial District. In 1907 the company absorbed the Colonial Trust Company, a commercial bank. During the Panic of 1907 it was the target of a bank run starting on October 23, 1907, which it survived with the backing of J. Pierpont Morgan and an infusion of gold from the Bank of England and other European sources.Mark Sullivan, Our Times, 1900-1925, Vol. III, pp. 504, 510-511.

The company ultimately represented a consolidation of the North American Trust Company, the former Trust Company of America, the City Trust Company and the Colonial Trust Company. The Trust Company of America was absorbed by the Equitable Trust Company in the spring of 1912. ==History== 1899-1903: Formation The Trust Company of America commenced business in 1895. Later on it represented a consolidation of the North American Trust Company, the former Trust Company of America, the City Trust Company and the Colonial Trust Company. The company was incorporated in Albany, New York on May 23, 1899. It had been promoted by Edward F. Cragin, James M. Donald of Hanover National Bank, and Alvah Trowbridge of the National Bank of North America. New York Representative Ashbel P. Fitch was founding president. To start, the company had $2,500,000 in capital stock, with a paid-up surplus of the same amount. However, its structure was not fully outlined, with the general belief that it would be a trust company of trust companies, \\"and as such, a Clearing House for them.\\" It was initially located in the Singer Building at Liberty Street and Broadway in Lower Manhattan's Financial District. 1904-1905: Merger In 1904 the North American Trust Company merged into the Trust Company of America. At the time, Oakleigh Thorne was president of the North American Trust Company. On April 12, 1905, it was reported that the City Trust, the North American Trust, and the Trust Company of America were merging in the near future, in what the Times called \\"the most important trust company consolidation of recent years.\\" It was announced the new company would be named the Trust Company of America, with capital of $2 million, a surplus of $9 million, and deposits over $50 million, \\"putting it among the strongest trust companies in New York.\\" Thorne, then president of the North American Trust Company, was announced as the architect of the merger. To facilitate the merger, Thorne employed a corporation to hold a majority of the stocks, with the Times writing that \\"Wall Street had never seen the idea applied to the control of banking institutions.\\" Thorne and his associates formed the Broadway Securities Company to hold a majority of the stocks from the North American and the Trust Company of America \\"against the efforts of the minority interests\\" endeavoring to block the consolidation. Stock in all three companies was also placed under the control of a committee, consisting of Charles T. Barney, George R. Sheldon, Hosmer B. Parsons, Emerson McMillin, Oakleigh Thorne, and William H. Leupp. A vote to ratify the merger was called for April 18, 1905. 1907: Colonial merger 37 Wall Street The company's second location was the ground floor of 37 Wall Street, a building which was designed by Francis Kimball and constructed during 1906 and 1907 for The Trust Company of America. The building, completed in 1907, stands at 25 floors. ′ On January 11, 1907, a plan was announced for a merger and consolidation of the Trust Company of America and the Colonial Trust Company, with Colonial to be absorbed. On January 16, 1907, meetings were held concerning the absorption of the Colonial Trust Company, with directors added to the board. Oakleigh Thorne was elected president, and John E. Borne was named chairman. The former quarters of the Colonial Trust Company continued to be maintained, in the St. Paul Building as the Colonial Branch. By October 1907, Colonial Trust Company operated as a branch of the Trust Company of America. Panic of 1907 As news spread of the Panic of 1907 in October, banks and trust companies were reluctant to lend any money. The interest rates on loans to brokers at the stock exchange soared to 70% and, with brokers unable to get money, stock prices fell to a low not seen since December 1900. The panic quickly spread to large trusts, including the Trust Company of America, the Lincoln Trust Company and Knickerbocker Trust. On the afternoon of Tuesday, October 22, the president of the Trust Company of America asked J.P. Morgan for assistance. That evening Morgan conferred with George F. Baker, the president of First National Bank, James Stillman of the National City Bank of New York (the ancestor of Citibank), and the United States Secretary of the Treasury, George B. Cortelyou. Cortelyou said that he was ready to deposit government money in the banks to help shore up their deposits, and the group prepared to audit the Trust Company of America. President Oakleigh Thorne believed his Trust Company of America bank was in sound financial condition until a New York Times article stated otherwise. Thorne told reporters that if he paid off every depositor, he would still have US$4 million in assets. According to 1912 witness testimony by Oakleigh Thorne, the run was caused when on October 23, 1907, the New York Times reported that George W. Perkins had made a statement that help was to be extended to the company. He asserted the trust's finances had been of a normal state beforehand. The Times later acknowledged this argument, and denied they were the cause, calling the assertion \\"perversions of fact\\" and stating Thorne's comment had been published in seven other newspapers as well. The Times also asserted that the run had begun the day before the reporting, on October 22. When the clearing house run by J. P. Morgan audited the bank's books, they found the bank was sound. After the overnight audit of the Trust Company of America showed the institution to be sound, on Wednesday afternoon October 23 Morgan declared, \\"This is the place to stop the trouble, then.\\" As a run began on the Trust Company of America, Morgan worked with Stillman and Baker to liquidate the company's assets to allow the bank to pay depositors. The bank survived to the close of business, but Morgan knew that additional money would be needed to keep it solvent through the following day. That night he assembled the presidents of the other trust companies and held them in a meeting until midnight when they agreed to provide loans of $8.25 million to allow the Trust Company of America to stay open the next day. The run on the bank continued on October 25, with a long line preventing some clients from withdrawing their funds. Ultimately, the trust withstood a run on its deposits lasting several days. On November 6, 1907, Trust Company of America president Oakleigh Thorne met with J. P. Morgan and others in a conference. Directly afterwards, Thorne announced the company was again \\"absolutely sound,\\" and had paid out $34,000,000 in banking since the start of the run. No changes in management were intended, with \\"ample\\" cash available. 1908-1912: After the panic and merger On December 21, 1911, the trust reported total resources of $34,220,982. By early 2012, the trust continued to have a \\"large building advantageously situated in the financial district,\\" owning the skyscraper at 37 to 43 Wall Street. Its banking rooms were described as \\"perfectly equipped\\" and \\"among the most spacious in the city.\\" On January 17, 1912, it was reported that president Alvin Krech of the Equitable Trust Company had made an offer of $375 per share for the stock of the Trust Company of America. Thorne approved, with the offer to stand open until February 15 pending a shareholder vote on the issue. The merged company would be named Equitable Trust Company, with the Trust Company of America eliminated. It was reported that if the merger went through, Equitable would have deposits of around $70 million. At the time, the Trust Company of America had capital of $2 million and a surplus of $6 million. It had deposits of $27 million. Thorne remained president until the Trust Company of America was absorbed by the Equitable Trust Company in the spring of 1912. The deal was accepted by the shareholders in early February 1912, and closed the first week of that month. Post-absorption and legacy As Equitable's skyscraper had recently burned down, Equitable moved itself into the banking rooms that the Trust Company of America owned on the bottom floor of their 37 Wall Street skyscraper. Equitable also obtained ownership of the entire skyscraper. Equitable later merged with Chase Manhattan Bank. As of January 1941, Arthur S. Kleeman was president of the Colonial Trust Company, which remained a commercial bank in New York. In August 1955, the Colonial Trust Company remained active, electing a new director James C. Olson. ==Directors== Directors for the new company were selected on May 22, 1899, and included Ashbel P. Fitch, William Barbour, Charles F. Cutler, John R. Hegeman, Henry O. Havemeyer, Myron T. Herrick, Henry S. Manning, Emerson McMillin, E. C. Converse, James M. Donald, Alvah Trowbridge, Samuel A. Maxwell, J. William Clark, Joel Francis Freeman, William E. Spier, Anson R. Flower, George Blumenthal, Henry S. Redmond, C. I. Hudson, S. C. T. Dodd, Willard Brown, Philip Lehman, and Edward F. Cragin. Among others, George Crocker (February 10, 1856 – December 4, 1909) served as a director. By early 1912, directors included Ashbel P. Fitch, Oakleigh Thorne, Albert B. Boardman, William H. Chesebrough, Charles D. Frecman, H. B. Hollins, Frank P. Lawrence, Charles C. Meyer, Seth M. Milliken, Morgan J. O'Brien, Joseph J. O'Donohoue, Jr., Lowell M. Palmer, Stephen Peabody, E.

Engraving by Georg Matthäus Vischer. Schloss Immendorf was a castle in the village of Immendorf near the market town of Wullersdorf in the district of Hollabrunn in the northeast of Lower Austria, within the Weinviertel region. From 1942 to May 1945, the Institut für Denkmalpflege (present day Bundesdenkmalamt, Vienna) rented rooms at Immendorf Castle for the purpose of storing art objects which included furniture from the MAK as well as the confiscated Lederer Klimt Collection. On 8 May 1945, on the last day of World War II the castle somehow caught on fire, presumably by the retreating German army, but not necessarily the SS as has been heretofore believed, and art stolen by the Nazis and paintings by Gustav Klimt stored therein were lost. ==History== Early owners include Bernhard von Immendorf and the Palterndorfers. Matthias Palterndorfer appears in the tax records in 1529. The castle was the seat of knightly followers who repeatedly adapted the building. In 1850, the last conversion of the plant took place, during which the moat was embedded. In 1886 Carl Freiherr von Freudenthal, from an old-noble Silesian family, acquired Schloss Immendorf. In the 20th century the small three-storey Kastellburg had four higher towers. After the fire in 1945, the ruins were vandalized for its building stone and the castle reduced to its foundation walls. In 1955, the Freudenthal family had the ruins torn down. ==Art store== From 1942-45, the Institüt für Denkmalpflege (currently the Bundesdenkmalamt, Vienna) rented rooms in Immendorf Castle for the purpose of storing art from various art collections including objects from the MAK, the art collection of the von Suttner family, and the confiscated Lederer Klimt Collection. On 8 May 1945, the last day of the war in the region, the castle caught on fire presumably started by the retreating \\"Feldherrnhalle\\"—a tank division of the German army.Storkovich, Tina Marie Die Presse: Verbrannte Klimtbilder: Das Puzzle von Immendorf; retrieved 27 May 2017 It has been assumed that this fire destroyed all the objects which had been relocated to the castle for safe storage. The losses included an important sequence of paintings by Gustav Klimt, the Klimt University of Vienna Ceiling Paintings of 1900 to 1907. It seems that the only remains of this particular collection of Klimt´s work are preparatory sketches many of which are in the collections of the Albertina (Vienna) and a few photographs (originally in the hands of Welz Gallery, Salzburg) but now in the ÖNB (Vienna). ==See also== * Lost artworks ==ReferencesExternal links== * iKlimt.com, Life and Work of Gustav Klimt * Universität Salzburg, Institut für Realienkunde des Mittelalters und der frühen Neuzeit: Immendorf * „Das Schloss der verbrannten Bilder“ at camerahumana.wordpress.com * Photos at noemedia-hollabrunn.heimat.eu Category:Castles in Austria Category:Buildings and structures destroyed during World War II Category:Lost paintings ","title":"Schloss Immendorf"},{"id":"54134100","text":"SV DFS is a football club from Opheusden, Netherlands. ==ReferencesExternal links== * Official site Category:Multi-sport clubs in the Netherlands Category:Football clubs in the Netherlands Category:Football clubs in Gelderland Category:Association football clubs established in 2001 Category:2001 establishments in the Netherlands Category:Sport in Neder-Betuwe ","title":"SV DFS"},{"id":"54134119","text":"Nomad Health is an online marketplace that directly connects physicians, nurses, and medical facilities for healthcare jobs, without the involvement third party employment agencies.

He contributed to our understanding of landscape history and environmental changes over the past 100,000 years in many parts of the world. He studied arid-region geomorphology and landscape evolution, as well as glacial geology and climate history. The study of these topics led him to the study of vegetation development and environmental history and allowed him to define the timing and mechanisms of climate-driven vegetational shifts in North America during the last 18,000 years and to recognize the role of natural fire in the dynamics of northern coniferous forests.Birks, H.J.B.

(Eds.), 1993. Global Climates Since the Last Glacial Maximum. University of Minnesota Press, Minneapolis. Beyond Minnesota and the Great Lakes region, Wright studied a wide range of research questions elsewhere in North America, and in the Near East, Europe, Asia, Latin America, and Antarctica. He advised over 75 graduate students and mentored many more students, visitors, and colleagues world-wide.http://lrc.geo.umn.edu/researchers.html == Early life and education == Wright was born on 13 September 1917 in Malden, Massachusetts. His father, Herbert Edgar Wright Sr. was an osteopath who died during the Spanish flu pandemic of 1919. His mother, Annie Mabel Richardson (1878–1964), was a nurse. Wright had an elder sister, Helena (1915–2010) who studied biology. He attended high school in Malden. He supplemented his meagre pocket money by cutting grass, selling papers, delivering and selling doughnuts made by his mother on Saturday mornings, and singing in local choirs.Birks, H.J.B.

The attack occurred in an Al-Qaeda compound that was used as a training facility for new combatants. ==Background== The raid took place four days after the United States Department of the Treasury designated two tribal leaders from the province as global terrorists for supporting al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, named Hashim Muhsin Aydarus al-Hamid, and Khalid Ali Mabkhut al-Aradah. In the designation, Hamid was identified as \\"a tribal leader in Yemen\\" who \\"regularly acted as an AQAP facilitator by assisting in the provision of weapons and money for AQAP.\\" Aradah was described as \\"a tribal sheikh and senior AQAP official in Yemen who facilitates financial support to AQAP, to include support to AQAP leadership.\\" Aradah also \\"runs an AQAP camp\\". ==The raid== According to US The raid started when U.S. Navy SEALs from DEVGRU, airlifted by helicopter to the central province of Marib, with the support of Yemeni authorities, attacked a compound on a residential block held by al- Qaeda fighters in the village of Al-Hathla. A firefight broke out, and a Lockheed AC-130 was called in. US officials said that several US soldiers were wounded during the battle, but none killed. According to US officials, US forces killed seven AQAP militants through a combination of small arms fire and precision airstrikes. According to Tribal and local sources According to reports in tribal and local Yemeni news websites and sources, at least thirty US soldiers, aided by Yemeni government soldiers, were deployed in the rural area of Al Hathla in the early hours of the day, and engaged in a gun battle with fighters from two prominent tribes in the village, Al-Moradi and Al-Aadhali. The reports said that during the ensuing fierce battle, at least seven US soldiers were killed. The reports added that no AQAP fighters had been in the area when three Boeing AH-64 Apache, and two Military transport aircraft of the US approached the village. Yemeni and U.S. officials did not confirm nor deny these reports. ==Aim of the raid== US officials said that the aim of the raid was to seize potentially important information from the compound—typically electronic devices such as computers, hard drives and cellphones—and was not an attempt to kill or capture a particular individual. It is not known if US forces managed to seize the information they wanted. ==Casualties== According to Tribal sources, the raid killed no AQAP fighters, but did kill five civilians and wounded six others, from the Al-Moradi clan, conflicting with the US claim that they had killed seven fighters from the Al- Aadhal tribe. The claims of the tribal leaders have not been confirmed by the Yemeni government. No U.S. forces were killed, but an unknown number were wounded. The Pentagon would not provide specifics on the number of troops wounded or the types of injuries incurred, citing privacy concerns and not wanting to immediately broadcast a battle damage assessment to enemy forces in the region. The wounds sustained were ambulatory, meaning U.S. forces conducting the mission were able to take themselves off the battlefield, according to Pentagon spokesperson, Capt. Jeff Davis. Some reports indicate that two of the wounded Navy SEALs suffered injuries to their arms and were flown to a hospital in Djibouti. These reports were not confirmed by US officials. Reprieve investigation Reprieve, a London-based human rights group, said it had talked to two sources from the raided village, who said that the raid went wrong from the start as the Seals opened fire on a 70-year- old partially blind man, named Nasser Al-Adhal, who had come out of his house to see what was going on, possibly to greet the US soldiers after mistaking them for visitors. On hearing al-Adhal being shot, other men then emerged from their homes, and four of them were shot dead by the Seals, according to the Reprieve account. According to Reprive investigators, they were \\"still trying to get a really full picture of exactly what happened, but what we do know is that Seals landed in the village, and they appear to have been trying to target a group of possible militants but in the course of the ground raid something went wrong, and they ended up killing a number of the people from the village, including a man of about 70, Nasser al-Adhal, who suffered from very bad eyesight. The four other villagers were killed when they started to argue with the Navy Seals after the shooting of Nasser al-Adhal. Six villagers were seriously injured, including another elderly man who was around 69 years old. After that, Al-Qaida fighters gathered nearby, after were alerted by the gunshots in the village and firefight ensued in which at least two of them were killed. The Navy Seals then left with the help of air support from a helicopter.\\" A US central command spokesman, Maj. Josh Jacques, said that the Reprieve report would be investigated. The Intercept investigation On May 28, The Intercept, an online news organization, published a report about the raid, which gathered reports of five different individuals who witnessed the raid. The eyewitnesses also claimed that civilians were killed, among them two young boys. Village residents gave a list of ten names of civilians killed and wounded during the raid. 15-year-old Abdullah Saeed Salem al Adhal was shot dead as he fled from his home with women and other children. Another child, 12-year-old Othman Mohammed Saleh al Adhal, was injured but survived. An additional seven men who were guests in one house in the village were also killed, according to a senior figure in al Adhlan. He was not able to identify the guests but they appear to account for the seven Al Qaeda militants that US forces claimed were killed. == See also == *Raid on Yakla ==References== Category:2017 in Yemen Category:21st-century military history of the United States Category:Battles involving the United States Category:Military operations involving the United Arab Emirates Category:Conflicts in 2017 Category:Operations involving American special forces Category:Yemeni Civil War (2015–present) Category:May 2017 events in Asia Category:Ma'rib Governorate Category:Trump administration controversies Category:May 2017 events in Yemen ","title":"Raid on Al Hathla"},{"id":"54134224","text":"VV Smitshoek is a football club from Barendrecht, Netherlands.

He originally selected it in September 1941 when he joined the \\"Combat\\" Resistance group. After the Liberation he became a literary critic, author and journalist, acknowledged during his final years as a member of the Paris left wing intellectual establishment. Openly gay, he is also remembered as a pioneering campaigner for gay rights. Known for his aestheticism, those whom he particularly admired included Stendhal, Proust and T. E. Lawrence. As an author, there are suggestions that his choice of subject matter was catholic sometimes verging on the eclectic. He wrote biographical works about both Habib Bourguiba and his old friend Georges Simenon. Outwardly cheerful, he attracted further headlines in December 1994 when he committed suicide by shooting himself. == Life == Roger Worms was born into a middle class Jewish family in Paris. His father was in business. He was taught by a private tutor, the scholar and writer René Étiemble, with whom he entered into a regular correspondence from the age of 15. Worms displayed little interest in the traditional subjects of a secondary education, which he managed to complete without passing his Baccalauréat, the traditional school leaving exam necessary for progressing to university level education. As a teenager, partly as a reaction to the tide of populist nationalism sweeping over western Europe, he became a fervent communist, frequenting left wing literary circles in Paris. Because of this, at a very young age he was noticed (and influenced) by some of the great writers of the day, such as André Gide, Roger Martin du Gard and André Malraux who encouraged him to become oriented towards \\"réflexion engagée\\" (literally \\"engaged reflection\\"). Even at a relatively young age he made no effort to conceal his homosexuality. Although war broke out in September 1939, for most people it was only after the German invasion of May/June 1940 that war's reality arrived in Paris. Worms involved himself in the resistance movement, and in September 1941 was one of those who created the \\"Combat\\" resistance network, and the eponymous resistance newspaper. He operated in the Aude department, according to one source, as an \\"ROP\\" (\\"Resistance, Organisation, Propaganda\\") agent. In May 1942 Roger Stéphane, as he was known to resistance comrades and, subsequently, to posterity, was arrested and held in Fort Barraux which had been converted into an internment camp, but he managed to escape on 16 November while undergoing a hospital visit to La Tronche. His arrest had been mandated by René Bousquet, secretary of state at the Interior Ministry of the puppet regime which at this time was governing the southern part of France with the increasingly inflexible backing of German state agencies such as the Gestapo. The ministry decree mandating his arrest cited his \\"gaullist activities\\". He was later rearrested and held at Évian-les-Bains, let out only in June 1944 as the war, in this part of Europe, drew to its conclusion. He lost little time in making his way to Paris where, during the final part of August 1944, together with Gérard Philipe, he took part in the liberation of the City Hall (\\"Hôtel de Ville\\"). During the final months of fighting he fought under André Malraux in the Alsace-Lorraine Independent Brigade. During the war André Malraux had been an implacable supporter of Charles de Gaulle and after the war, with de Gaulle in charge of the Provisional Government, and Malreaux enjoying heroic status during the highly charged months of postwar euphoria, his friend Roger Stéphane was employed by the Interior Ministry. It was Stéphane who arranged the arrest of Pierre Taittinger and the dismissal of the prefects (regional administrators) appointed by the \\"Vichy\\" puppet regime. During the 1940s he worked as a chronicler of contemporary politics and literary critic, contributing to \\"Temps modernes\\" (\\"Modern Times\\"), Paris-Soir and Combat. In 1950 he joined with Claude Bourdet and Gilles Martinet to found \\"L'Observateur\\". After a few years, known as \\"the adventurer in a bow tie\\", because of his dandyish appearance, he became a central figure in the French press, combining that role with a central presence in the intellectually dynamic Saint-Germain-des- Prés milieu. Familiars included Roger Vailland, Jean-Paul Sartre, Simone de Beauvoir, Jean Genet, Louis Aragon, François Mauriac, Georges Simenon and Marcel Jouhandeau. As an eloquent exponent of decolonisation, during the Indochina War he had his own taste of the inside of the vast Fresnes Prison for three weeks, in connection with \\"Exchanges of intelligence with the enemy\\". During the 1960s, working as a television producer with Roland Darbois, he was responsible for the series \\"Pour le Plaisir\\" and for a memorable documentary film entitled Proust, l'art et la douleur (\\"Proust, the artistry and the sorrow\\"). He also dedicated an unrepeatable \\"Memory portrait\\" of Proust, based on interviews with former friends of the novelist who had died four decades earlier. Those involved included Céleste Albaret, Emmanuel Berl, Jean Cocteau, Armand de Gramont, Daniel Halévy, François Mauriac, Paul Morand, Jacques de Lacretelle, Philippe Soupault, Hélène Soutzo and Simone de Caillavet. The audio-visual documentary, shot in black-and-white, was prepared only shortly before the deaths through age of several of the contributors. Viewers could watch and listen to some of the people closest to Proust (who had died in 1922), several of whom imitated his voice as they quoted him. observations. During the postwar years Roger Stéphane consciously withdrew from the limelight, indulging in what his biographer, Régine Deforges, termed as \\"la passion d'admirer\\", talking and writing relatively little about himself. Two exceptions deserve a mention. Appearing in 1952 \\"Parce que c'était lui\\" (\\"Because it was he\\") was an autobiographical account in which he reasserted his homosexuality. Much later, towards the end of his life, \\"Tout est bien\\" (\\"All's well\\"), is a chronicle of personal disillusion which won him renewed attention from the general public. == Published output (selection) == * Chaque homme est lié au monde, Sagittaire, 1946 * La Tunisie de Bourguiba, Plon, 1958 * L'Ascenseur, roman, Laffont, 1960 * T.

The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984 in recognition of the organization's history and its distinctive architecture. ==Description and history== Footguard Hall is located at the northwestern corner of downtown Hartford, at the northwest corner of High Street and Footguard Way. It is a large red brick building trimmed with brownstone, Its front section is two stories in height and capped by a hip roof, with a pyramidally roofed square tower rising near the center of the front facade. On either side of the tower are window bays with banded sash windows, set in rectangular openings on the ground floor and large rounded arches on the second. The main entrance is at the base of the tower, with a projecting round-arch portico providing shelter. A large assembly and drill hall extends to the rear of the front section. The First Company Governor's Footguard was established in 1771 by the Connecticut Colony as a formal means of protecting its governor and legislature. Members of the footguard have historically played a role in most of the nation's military conflicts, but the role they play is now largely ceremonial. Prior to the construction of this building, the company did not have its own dedicated armory. It was designed by the architectural firm of John C. Mead, a prominent local architect then in his last year of life. The design was likely the work of Melvin Hapgood, who was one of Mead's principal lieutenants and took over the firm after Mead died. The building was described at the time as the largest meeting hall between Boston and New York City, and has been used for public events. ==See also== *National Register of Historic Places listings in Hartford, Connecticut ==References== Category:National Register of Historic Places in Hartford, Connecticut Category:Romanesque Revival architecture in Connecticut Category:Buildings and structures completed in 1888 Category:Buildings and structures in Hartford, Connecticut ","title":"Footguard Hall"},{"id":"54134281","text":"The CAVB qualification for the 2018 FIVB Volleyball Men's World Championship saw member nations compete for three places at the finals in Italy and Bulgaria.

He was the father of the eponymous John Le Couteur (1794–1875). ==Early life and service in India== A member of a prominent Jersey family, John Le Couteur was the son of John Le Couteur (1718–1794), and Marie Bertault. Educated at the Royal Grammar School, Guildford, he obtained an ensigncy by purchase in the old 95th Foot in 1780, and served under Major Francis Peirson during the January 1781 Battle of Jersey. The same year, Le Couteur was promoted lieutenant in the old 100th Foot and was sent out with that regiment to India. While in the subcontinent, he was involved in operations against Hyder Ali during the Second Anglo-Mysore War. He was appointed brigade-major to Colonel Thomas Humberston and later served with General Matthews in Malabar. He was taken prisoner at Nagar (Bednore) in April 1783 by Tipu Sultan, and, following nearly a year of harsh imprisonment, was released following the Treaty of Mangalore in March 1784. Le Couteur described his campaigns in Letters, Chiefly from India, giving an Account of the Military Transactions on the Coast of Malabar during the late War (1790). ==Return to Jersey== Le Couteur became captain-lieutenant in 1784, and captain in 1785, when the 100th was disbanded and he was placed on half- pay. Le Couteur returned to Jersey and became adjutant in the Jersey militia in 1787. In 1793 he married Marie (1774–1845), daughter of Sir John Dumaresq; they had two sons. He was brought on full pay in the 11th Foot in 1793, and made brigade-major of the Jersey militia, where he gained a reputation as an energetic reformer. Between 1793 to 1795, he was charged with maintaining confidential contacts, via Jersey, between the British government and French royalists. He was promoted to major in the 16th Foot in 1797, but remained on the staff in Jersey until 1798, when he joined his regiment in Scotland as a brevet lieutenant-colonel. He was appointed inspecting-officer of militia in Jersey the following year, and was assistant quartermaster-general on the island during the detention on Jersey of Russian troops from the Texel in 1799–1800. He remained inspector of militia for twelve years. In 1811, Le Couteur was appointed a major-general on the staff in Ireland, and afterwards in Jamaica, where he led a brigade for two and a half years. ==Curaçao== Le Couteur was appointed lieutenant-governor of Curaçoa and its dependent islands in 1813, which he found on the verge of starvation. Curaçao, off the Venezuelan coast, was an important Caribbean commercial centre, but Anglo- American War of 1812 prevented the arrival of corn from Britain, and the orders in council banned the importation of foreign grain. Le Couteur set aside the orders to stave off famine. When the island was returned to the Dutch after the peace in 1815, the legislative bodies, the inhabitants, and Spanish refugees presented Le Couteur with addresses acknowledging the important services he had rendered to the colony. Le Couteur declined the Duke of York's offer to recommend him for command of a regiment, claiming he did not feel entitled to the honour as long as Peninsular officers remained unprovided for. ==Retirement and death== He retired to Belle Vue, the home he had bought in Saint Aubin, Jersey in 1792. Le Couteur became a lieutenant- general in 1821, and died aged 74 on 23 April 1835. He was buried at St Brelade's churchyard on 27 March. ==Family and legacy== Le Couteur was father of Colonel John Le Couteur, whose well-known memoirs of his War of 1812 service in the 104th Foot were edited and published by Donald Graves in 1993 as Merry Hearts Make Light Days. The younger John Le Couteur also dabbled in agricultural science in later life, was elected as a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1843, and served as an aide-de-camp to William IV and Victoria. ==Notes References == * * * Category:1760 births Category:1835 deaths Category:British generals ","title":"John Le Couteur (general)"},{"id":"54134389","text":"Nashebaaz: The Dying People of Delhi (English: Drug Addict) is 2016 Documentary film that was directed by Dheeraj Sharma.

This film took five years to be completed and had its premiere in Serbia in 2016. In 2017, a clip from the film became popular, later becoming an internet meme. == Background == Nashebaaz explores the problem of drug addiction in homeless people in Delhi that has been overlooked for several years. People visit Delhi in search of work and a better life, but when they are unable to find work they end up living on the streets. They are eventually introduced to some highly addictive drugs like heroin, pharmaceutical drugs and inhalant drugs. And as a form of escapism they are entrapped into the quagmire of drug addiction. Some drugs are so cheap that can even be bought for five rupees. It was filmed over a period of 5 years, from 2011 to its release in 2016. Part of the reason it took that length of time was the unapproachable nature for homeless people. == Production == The entire movie was shot by only 3 crew members: Dheeraj Sharma, Dhirendre Khandelwal, and Neeraj Agnihotri. == Reception == In 2017, a clip of the documentary became popular on the internet.

These 8 teams from the VFV will play the first round of a promotion-playoff, with two teams qualifying for the Promotion play-offs Final. In division A, champions Sint-Eloois Winkel and runners-up Mandel United together won all periods. As a result, Mandel United was joined in the play-offs by the next three teams in the standings: Petegem, Gent- Zeehaven and Wijgmaal. In division B, only Hasselt and Bocholt has received a licence, with the two other spots remaining vacant. Overall this meant only six out of eight teams took part, therefore two teams were drawn to receive a bye into the second round: Gent-Zeehaven and Wijgmaal. VFV Round 1 Bocholt and Ronse qualified for the VFV second round promotion play-offs. VFV Round 2 Ronse and Wijgmaal qualified for the promotion play-offs Final.

These 4 teams will play the first round of a promotion-playoff, with the winner qualifying for the Promotion play-offs Final. As champions La Louvière Centre won all three periods, this implied that normally the teams in positions 2 through 5 would take part in the playoffs, however both Hamoir and Rebecq were replaced as they did not receive (or apply for) a licence. Tilleur and La Louvière took their spot instead. ACFF Round 1 The two winning teams meet each other in round 2, the losing teams remain in the Belgian Second Amateur Division.

The winner of this play-off promotes to (or remains in) the 2019–20 Belgian First Amateur Division. As Oudenaarde is a team from the VFV side, there will be an extra VFV team relegating from the 2018–19 Belgian Second Amateur Division in case a team from the ACFF side (Visé) gets promoted.

Visé won on away goals and is promoted to the 2019–20 Belgian First Amateur Division. ==Relegation play- offs== The number of teams relegating from the Belgian Amateur Second Division in each wing (VFV and ACFF) depends on the number of teams of each wing relegating from the Belgian First Amateur Division. Upon completion of the 2018–19 Belgian First Amateur Division, with three VFV teams were relegated automatically, it was already known there would be at least one additional VFV team relegating from the 2018–19 Belgian Second Amateur Division. In case Oudenaarde, taking part in the Second Amateur Division Promotion play-offs Final and also from VFV side is also relegated and is replaced by a team from ACFF side, then a second VFV team will be relegated from the 2018–19 Belgian Second Amateur Division. On ACFF side on the other hand, no extra relegations would be necessary and only the three bottom teams in division C would be relegated. Relegation play-offs VFV The teams finishing 14th in divisions A and B played each other in a single match to avoid relegation, with the losing team relegated and the winning team having to await the result of the Second Amateur Division Promotion play-offs Final. City Pirates were relegated, three weeks later Eppegem was relegated as well as ACFF team Visé got promoted, resulting in an extra team from VFV to be relegated. Relegation play-offs ACFF As there is only one division no playoff was organised. However due to the fact that only teams from the VFV side were being relegated from the 2018–19 Belgian First Amateur Division, no extra relegations took place. ==References== Category:Belgian Second Amateur Division Bel 4 ","title":"2018–19 Belgian Second Amateur Division"},{"id":"54134468","text":"The Hampshire Cup is an annual rugby union knock-out club competition organised by the Hampshire Rugby Football Union.

The EU-SPI unit of analysis are the 272 NUTS 2 Regions of the European Union. To do so, it uses 50 indicators (the main data sources are Eurostat and the EU-SILC). Those 50 indicators are divided in three main dimensions: * Basic Human Needs * Foundations of Wellbeing * Opportunity Each dimension is divided in four components, which at the time contain from three to seven indicators. When the index was released, it showed a great contrast between how regions performed if we use the GDP per capita as a measure of well-being, and how they perform if we use the EU-SPI. Some regions, as the capital region of Belgium (Région de Bruxelles-Capitale), which has a large GDP per capita performed poorly in the EU-SPI (you can find other examples, mainly in capital regions and many regions in Italy and Spain) The publication of the Index had a notable media impact, including articles in the BBChttps://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-37616226, The Huffington Posthttps://huffingtonpost.com/entry/5818835ae4b09b190529c99a?timestamp=1478002155546 or El Paíshttp://elpais.com/elpais/2016/12/02/media/1480700831_596294.html == References == Category:Index numbers ","title":"EU Social Progress Index"},{"id":"54134484","text":"Lady Audrey Walsingham (; 1568–1624) was an English courtier. She served as Lady of the Bedchamber to queen Elizabeth I of England, and then as Mistress of the Robes to Anne of Denmark from 1603 until 1619. ==Family connections== Sometimes called \\"Etheldreda\\", she was born on 10 June 1568 to Sir Ralph Shelton of Shelton, Norfolk and Mary Woodhouse, daughter of William Woodhouse of Waxham. Her mother died five days after her birth.Francis Blomefield, An Essay Towards a Topographical History of the County of Norfolk, vol. 5 (London, 1806), p. 268. Her father was a son of Sir John Shelton and Margaret Parker, daughter of the heir to Henry, Lord Morley. John Shelton's mother was Anne Shelton née Boleyn, aunt of Anne Boleyn, Henry VIII's queen, and his sisters included Madge Shelton and Mary Shelton. Her aunt Mary Shelton married Sir John Scudamore. Audrey Shelton married Sir Thomas Walsingham, cousin of Sir Francis Walsingham. Their home was Scadbury Manor at Chislehurst. The \\"Rainbow\\" portrait of Queen Elizabeth has been associated with the Harefield Entertainment ==Lady of the Bedchamber to Elizabeth== She served as Lady of the Bedchamber to Queen Elizabeth. In 1600 the Earl of Northumberland presented Elizabeth with a petticoat supplied by Lady Walsingham and a jewel bought from John Spilman, the total value of his gift was £200.HMC 6th Report: Northumberland (London, 1879), p. 228. During Thomas Egerton's entertainment at Harefield in August 1602, she was assigned in the lottery the prize of a cutwork stomacher in the lottery with these verses; \\"This stomacher is full of windows wrought, Yet none through them can look into your thought.\\"Elizabeth Goldring, Faith Eales, Elizabeth Clarke, Jayne Elisabeth Archer, John Nichols's The Progresses and Public Processions of Queen Elizabeth, vol. 4 (Oxford, 2014), pp. 184-6, 190 modernised here.

The historian Janet Arnold linked this presentation at Harefield with the \\"Rainbow\\" portrait of Elizabeth at Hatfield House.Janet Arnold, Queen Elizabeth's Wardrobe Unlocked (London, 1988), pp. 83-4, 94. The embroidery depicted in the portrait has some similarities with the contemporary petticoat formerly preserved at St Faith's Bacton, Herefordshire.Eleri Lynn, 'The Bacton Altar Cloth', Costume, 52:1 (March 2018), pp. 18-20. ==Mistress of the Robes to Anne== In 1603, Walsingham was selected by the Privy Council to join an English entourage sent to meet the new queen Anne of Denmark at the Scottish border, and accompany her to London. Her companions included the Countess of Kildare and the Countess of Worcester. At first the queen was reluctant to make Walsingham and Kildare ladies of her Privy Chamber, but preferred Lucy Russell, Countess of Bedford.Edmund Lodge, Illustrations of British History, vol. 3 (London, 1838), pp. 11-12. Lady Anne Clifford noted that she was a great favourite of Sir Robert Cecil at this time.Jessica L. Malay, Anne Clifford's Autobiographical Writings (Manchester, 2018), p.19. She was appointed Mistress of the Robes on 26 July 1603 by Anna of Denmark, and given a salary of 40 marks yearly. The role including buying \\"stuffs of gold, silver, tinsel, silk\\", and appointing tailors and embroiderers for the queen's apparel.Mary Anne Everett Green, CSP Domestic: Addenda: 1580-1625 (London, 1872), p. 427, TNA SP15/35 f.61. Anne asked Walsingham and the Countess of Suffolk to take Elizabeth's old clothes from a store in the Tower of London for a masque at Christmas 1603.Sara Jayne Steen, The letters of Lady Arbella Stuart (Oxford, 1994), p. 197. She participated in the masques organised by queen Anne, and played the role of Astraea in The Vision of the Twelve Goddesses (1604), and Periphere in Masque of Blackness (1605). In May 1606 she was paid £300 towards the supply of linen for Anne of Denmark during childbed and for the use of Princess Mary.Frederick Madden, Issues of the Exchequer (London, 1836), pp. 34-5. One of her servants died at Hampton Court in October 1606 during plague scare.A. B. Hinds, HMC Downshire, vol. 2 (London, 1936), p. 439.

She was rumored to have a relationship with Robert Cecil (d. 1612), and in the anonymous poem O Ladies, Ladies Howle & Cry she was accused of having caused his death together with the Countess of Suffolk by infecting him with syphilis. In August 1615 thieves took embroidered cushion and stool covers and sewing silk for embroidery weighing 40 pounds from Whitehall Palace said to belong to her husband, but may have been connected with the queen's wardrobe.Constance Brown Kuriyama, Christopher Marlowe: A Renaissance Life (Cornell, 2002), p. 101 quoting Middlesex Court Records, vol. 2, p. 100.

Is also grows in the wild in Taiwan and Vietnam, and is a garden tree all over the world. While earlier grouped under Gordonia, the genus Polyspora has been found to be not closely related to the North American species, thus transferring the species to its own genus. ==Description== Polyspora axillaris grows on hillsides, and is adapted to holding on to slopes while being exposed to rain and storms. Its brown bark peels off in rather large smooth pieces. The fruit superficially resembles the green part of an acorn. The flowers are rather big, with five white petals, and many yellow anthers. They are fragrant and attract bees and butterflies. Some flowers grow in the leaf axils, leading to its scientific name, P. axillaris. The flower will fall off the tree before wilting. ==Distribution== Polyspora axillaris is normally found in forests and thickets at elevations of 100 – 800 m, but has been found at elevations up to 2300 m. It occurs in Guangdong, Guangxi, Hainan, Taiwan and Hong Kong.

The two leagues played an interlocking schedule consisting of 40 to 44 interleague games per team. At the end of each season, an Alliance champion was determined in the Triple-A Classic, a best- of-seven postseason series. ==History== The Triple-A Alliance, with Harold Cooper as its commissioner, was formed on October 1, 1987, at the annual Triple-A fall meeting in Hollywood, Florida. Under the partnership, the 8 teams of the American Association and the 8 teams of the International League would play each other 5 times for a total of 40 interleague games in their 142-game schedules in 1988. The Triple-A Pacific Coast League, located primarily in the Western United States, chose not to participate due to the difficulties and high costs associated with travel to cities in the other leagues. Both participating leagues were organized into two four-team divisions, East and West. At the end of the season, each league determined its own champion in a best-of-five series between division winners. The leagues' champions then met to determine an Alliance champion in the Triple-A Classic, a best-of-seven series. In the 1988 Classic, the AA's Indianapolis Indians defeated the IL's Rochester Red Wings, 4–2. Over the course of the season, the AA led with 187 interleague wins to the IL's 131 wins. Both leagues reported increases in regular and postseason attendance during the Alliance's first year. The partnership was subsequently extended through 1991. In order to cut down on the amount of travel required by the two-day series often scheduled in the 1988 season, the 1989 slate was expanded to 146 games with 44 interleague games per team, increasing most interleague series to three games. The Indianapolis Indians repeated as Alliance champions, defeating the IL's Richmond Braves, 4–0, in the 1989 Triple-A Classic. The IL narrowly won the regular interleague series, 178–170. Each league set new attendance records with over five million people visiting Alliance ballparks. Commissioner Harold Cooper retired after the season and was succeeded by Randy Mobley who had served as administrator of the Alliance and the International League for the past two seasons. In 1990, the Alliance was operated under the same 146-game schedule with 44 interleague contests per team. At the 1990 Triple-A Classic, the AA's Omaha Royals defeated the IL's Rochester Red Wings, 4–1. The AA won the regular season with 181 wins to the IL's 170. Facing the possibility of increased costs to be incurred under a new Professional Baseball Agreement between Major and Minor League Baseball teams, the Alliance voted at the 1990 Winter Meetings to contract its interleague schedule to save on travel expenses. The 144-game 1991 schedule eliminated games between the AA West and IL East. On July 9, 1991, at the Triple-A All-Star Game, International League team owners voted, 5–3, to discontinue interleague play with the American Association after the season. Despite an overall increase in attendance—a minor-league record 4,093,525 for the AA and an IL-record 2,958,482—six of eight IL teams had below-average attendances when hosting interleague teams. The combination of poor attendance, travel costs, and difficulty in drawing up season schedules were all factors in their decision to end the partnership. The final Triple-A Classic was won by the AA's Denver Zephyrs, 4–1, versus the Columbus Clippers. The IL bested their AA opponents, 139–99, in the regular season. After four years of interleague competition, the American Association's record stood at 637–618. ==Teams== ;American Association *Buffalo Bisons (1988–1991) *Denver Zephyrs (1988–1991) *Indianapolis Indians (1988–1991) *Iowa Cubs (1988–1991) *Louisville Redbirds (1988–1991) *Nashville Sounds (1988–1991) *Oklahoma City 89ers (1988–1991) *Omaha Royals (1988–1991) ;International League *Columbus Clippers (1988–1991) *Maine Phillies (1988) *Pawtucket Red Sox (1988–1991) *Richmond Braves (1988–1991) *Rochester Red Wings (1988–1991) *Scranton/Wilkes-Barre Red Barons (1989–1991) *Syracuse Chiefs (1988–1991) *Tidewater Tides (1988–1991) *Toledo Mud Hens (1988–1991) ==Season-by-season results== Over the all-time interleague series, American Association teams won 637 games, 19 more than the International League's 618 wins.

With Great Britain winning the trophy in 1936 following victories over Australia and New Zealand, the trophy was held in Great Britain until 1951 although it was returned to Australia for safe storage during the Second World War. It was also considered for use as a substitute for the Ashes Cup when that trophy went missing in 1937. Until the 1950s the trophy was awarded ever time the holders played one of the other three teams but then the award was made every five years to the team with the highest winning percentage of test matches during that period.

Built in 1936 using Works Progress Administration funding, it is notable as a well-preserved WPA municipal project and for its significance in the early development of the Nob Hill area. with The building served in its original role as a fire station until 1972 and currently houses a restaurant. It is the city's third oldest surviving fire station after the AT&SF; Fire Station, built in 1920, and the old station #2 on the corner of High St. and Silver Ave. opened in 1926. The fire station is listed in the New Mexico State Register of Cultural Properties and the National Register of Historic Places. It was designed by Albuquerque's City Architect, Ernst H. Blumenthal, who also designed the Old Albuquerque Municipal Airport Building (1939), which is also NRHP-listed. ==History== In the 1930s, Albuquerque was undergoing rapid development along Central Avenue on the high ground east of Downtown, an area then known as the East Mesa. As the city worked to extend municipal services to the new residents, it was able to take advantage of federal funding from New Deal programs for many of its projects. This included a Works Progress Administration grant of $14,300 to build a new fire station. The building was designed by city architect E. H. Blumenthal and was completed in November 1936 after just five months of construction. The total cost of the project was about $24,000. The building served the city as Fire Station No. 3 for over thirty years. The station originally housed one pumper truck with a crew of five, but was expanded in 1952 to accommodate a longer ladder truck and a crew of ten. However, by the 1970s the station's doors were too small for the newest fire engines and its location on traffic-heavy Central Avenue was inconvenient. The city built a new Fire Station No. 3 about four blocks away on Girard Boulevard in 1972 and the old station was sold. During the 1970s and 80s, the building housed a variety of tenants including an art gallery, a church, and a film production studio. In 1985 it was converted to a restaurant and bar called Monte Vista Fire Station, which has remained in operation since. The fire station was added to the New Mexico State Register of Cultural Properties in 1981 and the National Register of Historic Places in 1987. ==Architecture== Designed by E. H. Blumenthal, the Monte Vista Fire Station is a two-story Pueblo Revival building with a three-story corner tower. The building is constructed from structural clay tile and stuccoed to resemble New Mexico's traditional adobe buildings with stepped parapets, projecting vigas, and ladders. The tower has staggered windows following the stairs inside and contains a three-story central shaft for drying fire hoses. The building retains its original garage doors and wood-framed 6/6 sash windows. A matching addition at the rear of the building was added in 1952 to accommodate larger trucks. ==References== Category:Buildings and structures on the National Register of Historic Places in New Mexico Category:National Register of Historic Places in Albuquerque, New Mexico Category:Fire stations completed in 1936 Category:Fire stations on the National Register of Historic Places in New Mexico Category:New Mexico State Register of Cultural Properties ","title":"Monte Vista Fire Station"},{"id":"54134964","text":"The Scarlet Witch is a fictional superheroine appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics.

Following her mother's death and discovering that she had a younger sister named Gavrill (fusion of Quicksilver and Honey Badger), she decided to escape the Evolutionaries along with her sister, but was cut in pieces by Hellhound, while Herbert took Gavrill in order for her to become the new vessel for Mephicton.

Bostwick successfully litigated against Filmation Associates, which was forced to pay him for the remainder of his contract, plus residuals, including the entire second season.) Davey has recalled that the producers were hastily seeking to replace Bostwick.

On 22 May 2017, with the required majority of 72% of the EU27 states, (i.e. 20 member states representing 65% of the population of the EU27), the negotiating directives were approved. This gave authority for the EU negotiating team to negotiate with the UK in accordance with the guidelines and directives. == May 2017 negotiating directives == Key articles in the negotiating directives are set out below. Numbers refer to negotiating directive document paragraphs. Objectives * Negotiate and conclude a withdrawal agreement with the UK. (I.1) * Orderly withdrawal of the UK from the European Union and from the European Atomic Energy Community. (I.3) Nature and scope * EU law shall cease to apply to the UK on the date the withdrawal agreement becomes effective. (II.6) Also to apply to UK overseas countries and territories. (II.7) * Withdrawal date to be 30 March 2019 or such other date as both sides shall agree. (II.8) Purpose and scope of directives  * Two phase approach: (1) clarify positions of citizens, businesses, stakeholders and international partners of effect of Brexit, and (2) sort out the disentanglement of the UK and rights and obligations of the UK from its commitments to the EU. (III.9) * These directives only cover the first phase of Brexit, the withdrawal; additional directives will be issued. (III.10) * First priority is status and rights of the EU27 citizens in UK and UK citizens in the EU27, including effective, enforceable, non-discriminatory and comprehensive guarantees for those citizens' rights. (III.11) * Agreement of principle for the settlement of financial obligations. (III.12) * Issues of judicial cooperation in civil, commercial and criminal matters and administrative and law enforcement cooperation procedures. (III.13) * Nothing in the Agreement should undermine the objectives and commitments set out in the Good Friday Agreement. Negotiations should avoid the creation of a hard border on the island of Ireland. Irish citizens residing in Northern Ireland will continue to enjoy rights as EU citizens. Goods in transit routed through the UK should not be affected. (III.14) * Recognition of UK Sovereign Base Areas in Cyprus. (III.15) * Protection of EU interests in the UK. (III.16) * Governance, enforcement and dispute arrangements of this agreement. (III.17) * Possible common approach towards third country partners, international organisations and conventions that currently bind the UK.

Transitional arrangements (if any) must be clearly defined, limited in time, and subject to effective enforcement mechanisms. (III.19) Citizen rights  * Safeguard the status and rights derived from EU law of citizens at the withdrawal date and those future rights such as pensions.

(III.2.25-29) * EU obligations to UK beneficiaries after withdrawal date and rules regarding contingent liabilities.

Charter Stones date back to ancient times when such stones were granted to individuals or communities in lieu of written charters to signify the granting of land by the crown, feudal overlords or other individuals. They were used to record ownership of land before written documents came into general use. ==Characteristics of Charter Stones== The stones were sometimes engraved or were instead distinctive in terms of colour, composition or shape. The use of these stones may relate to the common practice of using boundary stones to establish precise limits to areas of land ownership but differ in that the proof of the land ownership was invested in them. Being stone they had a permanence that gave them an advantage over charters written on vellum, etc. An essential element was that the stone in question had once belonged to the donor and was next held by the grantee. The size, weight and individuality of charter stones helped to ensure that they were not easily stolen or moved any significant distance. ==Surviving examples== The Kilnasaggart Charter Stone. Replica of the Stone of Scone. In Old Dailly a tradition has it that when worship was discontinued at the old kirk in 1695 the people of Dailly insisted that the 'Blue stone' or charter stone should be removed from the old kirk to the new parish church. The people of Old Dailly refused to part with their ancient stone and in his historical notes located in Sir Walter Scott’s “Lord of The Isles”, he records this conflict in Dailly parish and notes that it was settled ‘when man, woman and child from both communities marched out and by one desperate engagement put an end to the conflict’. The inhabitants of Old Dailly triumphed and the 'Blue Stone' still resides in the old churchyard. Old Dailly is sometimes recorded as the 'Blue Stone Burgh'. Smith in 1895 mentions charter stones plural and suggests that the tradition of trials of strength, in common with the 'Leper's Charter Stone' at Prestwick, was linked with proof that the person granted the land involved was mature enough to hold it. At the Bruce's Well, Kingcase in Prestwick, records describe the Lepers' Charter Stone as being the shape of a sheep's kidney, formed of basalt, blue in colour and as smooth as glass. It weighed around 15 stones or 95 Kilograms and its weight was such that it could only be lifted with arms extended and cupped in a cavity in the stone. Lifting it was considered proof of the passage to manhood. Sources state that some English dragoons encamped one night at Bruce's Well where the charter stone was kept and somehow managed to break it. The pieces were collected and carefully kept by the freemen of Prestwick and later incorporated into the consolidated walls of the old St Ninian's Chapel (see video). Another source states that \\"... a low character of the name of Allison, who rented a salt-pan in the neighbourhood, about the year 1800 bribed a drunk man, who broke the stone in pieces.\\" The Old Inverness Market cross and Clach na Cudainn Charter Stone The London Stone The Clach na Cudainn (Gaelic for 'stone of the tub') or Charter Stone of Inverness was kept in the market place, set in a frame and bound with iron. Also known as the Clachnacuddin Stone it is said that as long as the stone is preserved then Inverness will flourish. The upper surface was supposedly worn flat by the action of women resting their tubs or pails on it whilst they rested. Near Blair Atholl at Pitagowan in Perthshire the Clach na h-Iobairt (the stone of offering) or 'Bridge of Tilt' standing stone is said to be a charter stone that records a land grant, possibly to the Church of Kilmaveonaig. The Stone of Scone was regarded as being the charter stone of the Kingdom of Scotland. In Wales charter stones are recorded from Llanllyr in Merioneth (circa 8th century) and Merthyr Mawr (11th century) and Ogmore (11th century) in Glamorgan. The example at Merthyr Mawr carries the inscription \\"in grefium in propium\\" which translates literally as \\"ownership was registered\\" and commemorates St Glywys. The Ogmore charter stone also honours St Glywys and records a Bishop Fili who was the grantee of an ager, a field. In England the ancient London Stone has been put forward as a charter stone due to its proximity to lands once held by Canterbury Cathedral. The Kirkby Stephen charter stone in Cumbria is till used on St Luke’s Fair day in October for the reading of the market's charter. Also in Cumbria is the Ca'an Stone in the main street of Kendal, once part of the market cross, but possibly older and once used as a place where proclamations were read. A possible example has been recorded at Stoke near Hartland in North Devon. In Ireland's County Armagh an eighth century example of a charter stone is recorded at Kilnasaggart. In the Isle of Man it is recorded that it was common for charter stones to be given as a sign of transfer of ownership, the stone itself once having been the property of the donor. ==Micro-history== The Kendal Ca' Stone Records show that before the Norman conquest other items that once belonged to the donor of property were given in lieu of a written charter, such as swords, helmets and especially horns. Tradition has it that charter stones are sometimes possessed with special powers such as bringing good luck to those who touch them and in some cases they can supposedly cure certain illness, etc. The Old Dailly stone is said to have held the right of being a sanctuary stone. The larger of the two Old Dailly charter stones weighs between and the smaller between and like the old Lepers' charter stone at Prestwick is smooth and their shape make them difficult to grip them easily and over the years they became a weight lifting challenge. In international stone lifting circles the name The Big Blue was the name given to the largest Old Dailly stone as a ‘lifting’ or ‘testing’ stone however the local council have bound both with metal hoops and they cannot at present be lifted. == References See alsoExternal links== *Dalmakerran Kirk, Blue Stones and Memorials. *The Old Dailly Blue, Charter or Sanctuary Stones, South Ayrshire *Bruce's Well at Kingcase, Prestwick. *St Ninian's Chapel and Lazar (Leper) Hospital, Prestwick Category:Monument types Category:Boundary markers Category:Stones Category:Charter fairs Category:Mythological objects ","title":"Charter Stones"},{"id":"54135210","text":"Miguel Mallqui (born 10 December 1971) is a Peruvian long-distance runner.
