The activity is controversial as it appears to conflict with the nature of yoga. ==History== The International Federation of Sports Yoga has organised annual championships since 1989, and is led by Fernando Estevez-Griego (Swami Maitreyananda). These competitions are not restricted to asanas, but cover all eight limbs of yoga identified in the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali. The 1989 competition was held in Montevideo with the asana competition in Pondicherry. Competitive yoga has been practised by adults in America since 2009 under the auspices of the nonprofit organisation USA Yoga; competitions were later introduced for children from the age of 7. The fiercely contested Bishnu Charan Ghosh Cup is held annually in Los Angeles. Ghosh inspired the yoga style of Bikram Choudhury, the founder of Bikram Yoga, and Choudhury has been closely associated with America's competitive yoga from its inception. The documentary film Posture by Nathan Bender and Daniel Nelson portrays competitors and detractors of the USA Yoga Federation National Championship. ==Sport or spiritual== The idea of competitive yoga seems an oxymoron to some people in the yoga community. The author Rajiv Malhotra described competitive yoga as \\"a form of misappropriation\\". The yoga teacher Loretta Turner called the term \\"offensive, because yoga is much more than posturing\\". The journalist Neal Pollack said that the goal of all types of yoga is samadhi, \\"enlightened bliss where the ego separates from the self and the practitioner realizes that hes powerless to control the vagaries of an endlessly shifting universe\\". Instead, Pollack continued, yoga competitions consist of the performance of asanas derived from hatha yoga. He concluded that he was not sure what he had witnessed, but he was glad to return to his usual modest yoga, free of competitiveness. Yoga practitioners and their instructors commonly work to avoid any feeling of competitiveness. The yoga instructor Tanya Boulton comments that yoga is challenging because it teaches people not to be competitive but to be at peace with themselves. Practitioners are advised not to compare themselves to other people in their class, and to accept that yoga is an inner thing, not a matter of physical perfection. == References == Category:Yoga styles ","title":"Competitive yoga"},{"id":"60346295","text":"The 1939 Rice Owls football team was an American football team that represented Rice University as a member of the Southwest Conference (SWC) during the 1939 college football season.

He is known for his work in studying the role of allergen detection and tissue-disruptive signals in orchestrating early innate immune responses that result in the development of type 2 immune responses. Specifically, he is interested in the dysregulation of these responses that result in asthma, allergies, and atopic dermatitis. Fritz has done research is various topics in immunology, but his favourite work was with the development of vaccine adjuvants which he worked on during his MSc and PhD. == Early life and educationInterview with Dr. Jörg H. Fritz on March 18, 2019 == Born and raised in Bruck an der Leitha, Austria in 1965, Fritz chose to attend a biochemistry high school in Vienna, Austria after becoming fascinated by the natural sciences presented in an Austrian television show Universum at the age of 10. He began his undergraduate studies at the University of Vienna, studying microbiology and genetics. At the age of 19, Fritz lost his father to cancer, which influenced him to further his studies to understand cancer and why the human body has troubles fending off the disease. After receiving his Bachelor of Science degree in 1999, he continued as a graduate student at the University of Vienna, in cooperation with Intercell AG (now Valneva) under the supervision of Drs. Alexander von Gabain and Max L. Birnstiel. Fritz's graduate work primarily focused on the development of a novel vaccine adjuvant IC31 and defended his thesis on \\"The effects of antimicrobial peptides on the immune system\\". He received his Master of Science degree in December 2000 and Doctor of Philosophy degree in September 2004. == Academic career == Fritz began his career in immunology as he believes the immune system is a perfect intersection of prokaryotes and eukaryotes since one can gather information about both worlds while taking evolution into account. This is important to Fritz as he is of Austrian heritage, and model of science research in Austria is heavily tied to the theory of evolution. Fritz's goal with his research is to increase humankind's knowledge of how the immune system works and share the excitement for the beauty of our world through science. Although Fritz has been a scientist for over 10 years, he still finds it fascinating how nature has designed the immune system to have various functions and the endless ways one could design experiments to study the immune system. === Post-doctoral fellowships === Following his graduate studies, Fritz entered a post-doctoral fellowship at the Institute Pasteur in 2004 under Dana Philpott to investigate how innate immune recognition of microbes by the Nod-like receptors, Nod1 and Nod2, instructs inflammatory and antigen-specific immune responses to fend off bacterial infections. They discovered that the detection of peptidoglycan, a bacterial cell wall polymer, by Nod1 and Nod2 is essential for mounting innate and adaptive immune responses to Salmonella and Helicobacter infections. In 2006, Philpott was offered a Faculty position at the University of Toronto in Ontario, Canada and Fritz made the decision to move to Toronto to continue his post-doctoral fellowship. In 2007, Fritz pursued a second post-doctoral fellowship under Dr. Jennifer L. Gommerman at the University of Toronto. There, he studied how immunoglobulin A (IgA) in plasma cells regulate the intestinal B cell response. IgA released by plasma cells is important for maintaining a first-line of defense against food-borne pathogens and toxins in the gut. Fritz discovered that tumor necrosis factor alpha and inducible nitric oxide synthase are required for IgA plasma cell homeostasis during healthy and infection conditions. From these results, he suggests that plasma cells should be re-examined for their roles in inflammation and infection. === Research focus and findings === In 2010, Fritz was offered a Faculty position at McGill University in Montreal, Quebec, and has established his research laboratory there. During the early years of his laboratory, he continued investigating how innate immune recognition of microbes through Nod1 and Nod2 dictates innate and adaptive immune responses. He later shifted interests towards studying how allergen detection and tissue-disruptive signals can result in early innate immune responses that may be deregulated and lead to the onset of detrimental type 2 immune responses that cause asthma, allergies, and atopic dermatitis. Group 2 innate lymphoid cells are central in the processes mentioned and his laboratory is currently studying the molecular underpinnings of these cells. Working with Dr. Salman Qureshi, it has been determined that Cryptococcus neoformas infections are positively correlated with the induction of interleukin-33 in the lung, which results in the increase of group 2 innate lymphoid cells and elevated type 2 immune responses that further contributes to fungal pathogenesis induced. Current research goals of his laboratory is to identify (1) cellular and molecular requirements of interleukin-33-mediated group 2 innate lymphoid cell activation, (2) how interferons regulate group 1 and 2 innate lymphoid cell functions, and (3) mechanisms of cytokine trafficking in group 2 innate lymphoid cells. == Fellowships and awards == * 2012, Research Achievement Award for research publication with the highest impact factor, McGill University * 2008–2010, Career development fellowship of the Austrian Programme for Advanced Research and Technology (APART), Academy of Sciences Austria * 2006–2007, Erwin Schrodinger Postdoctoral Research Fellowship, Austrian Research Fund * 2005–2006, Programme Transversal de Recherche, Postdoctoral Research Fellowship, Institute Pasteur * 2004–2005, Association Francois Aupetit, Postdoctoral Research Fellowship == Editorships == * Academic editor, PLOS ONE, 2010-present * Ad hoc editor, Frontiers in Immunology, Journal of Leukocyte Biology, Cellular and Molecular Immunology, Science Signalling, Nature Immunology, Science Immunology, 2018 == Most significant contributions == * Schellack C., Prinz K., Egyed A., Fritz J.H., Wittmann B., Ginzler M, Swatosch G., Zauner W., Kast C., Akira S., von Gabain A., Buschle M., Schmidt W., Lingnau K. \\"IC31, a novel adjuvant signaling via TLR9, induces potent cellular and humoral immune responses\\".

The group was augmented by trombonist Ian Gray, trumpeter Joe Gullace, and mallet percussionist AJ Merlino. The Dreams that Stuff Are Made Of is described as high-energy, rhythmic and dense progressive rock that spans several genres, and it draws comparison to the music of King Crimson, Mr. Bungle, The Mars Volta, Frank Zappa, Gentle Giant, and Yes. ==Reception== Dream Theater drummer Mike Portnoy writes \\"Damn!

If Zappa's Barking Pumpkin label was still active, Karmic Juggernaut might be the first band he would sign. Sprawling, fearless psychedelic rock, the songs can be playful or rocking, and often a swirling combination of both,\\" and ends with saying that the album is \\"indeed a tank of innovative ideas performed by a collection of immensely skilled, like-minded geniuses who relish the idea of being musical outliers.\\" Progressive Music Planet says \\"once you ride [the] wave and let the music unfold, one gets some pretty excellent syncopated full-band acrobatics with dynamics that ebb-and-flow and deliver right into the next track.

Her father, Moshe (\\"Mosi\\") was a shopkeeper, and a student of Rabbi Yiḥyah Qafiḥ, leader of the Dor Daim religious stream. Her mother was Hamama, most of whose family already lived in Israel since 1932. Serri came to Israel at the age of 10 with her parents in Operation Magic Carpet. The family settled in the Yemenite neighborhood near Kiryat Ata. Serri has a BA an MA in Hebrew and Semitic Linguistics from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, and worked researching Yemenite dialects, especially the language of women. During the 1960s and 1970s, in Jerusalem, there was a surge of social movements, affected by similar developments elsewhere in the world, dealing with social and political rights – including the Black Panthers (Mizrahi social movement) and Matzpen (anti-Zionism). Serri became involved a group on campus dedicated to empowerment of the Yemenite population. Serri taught Hebrew to Palestinians from East Jerusalem (only recently conquered by Israel, in 1967), and initiated literacy campaigns in immigrant communities. In the early 1970s, she married an American-born ex-hippy, whom she later left with her two young children due to domestic violence, and raised them alone. In cooperation with the Jerusalem municipality, Serri ran youth programs, but often found herself at odds with the bureaucratic establishment. This was a recurring theme for Serri, who found herself on the margins of almost every social and institutional setting: At the university, she found intellectual development, but detachment from her religion, culture and tradition. In her work with the city and with religious organizations, she was the \\"primitive\\" Mizrahi in an Ashkenazi world. In a nation ruled by military men, she was a woman. During 1989–1997 Serri lived in Berkeley, California. == Writing == Serri's writing focuses on several main subjects, including Judaism, Mizrahi identity, and political feminism. Her often overtly political and feminist poetry draws heavily on the metaphoric tradition of the great Yemenite poets, such as Shalom Shabazi. Her first published work was a short story, \\"Kri'a\\" (\\"Tearing\\", 1980), which appeared in the feminist journal Noga. The story was adapted into a play by the same name, which ran for over a year, toured twice between 1983 and 1987, and garnered praise from the critics. The story, dealing with the patriarchal traditions of marriage in Yemen, was also included in a women's stories anthology in 1994. It tells of the wedding night of a young girl, given in marriage by her father to an old man, who is already twice-widowed. The girl is completely innocent and unprepared for what is to come. The narrative is from the girl's perspective, and is described as a violent rape, which is, in her culture, the rite of passage from girlhood to womanhood, which to her horror, means complete enslavement to home and family. She becomes pregnant, and the story ends with the difficult description of giving birth to her first son. She wrote this story under a pen name, Pu'ah Meri-Dor, in her words, \\"out of embarrassment\\" because of the taboo subject. At the core of Serri's writing are autobiographical foundations. One was her mother, who was uneducated, married young, and gave birth to 18 children. Serri wanted to empower women like her mother, and give them voice. She recalled that she wrote her poems for her mother, but was afraid that she would think Serri was mocking her when she handed her the published book. But to Serri, her mother was the first poet she knew. The women in Yemen, who led lives almost completely separate from the men, would sing or chant about their problems and feelings while doing household tasks, repeating and adding lines as they moved from chore to chore. It was only upon arriving in Israel, Serri said, that her mother fell silent. This was the more personal, and feminist aspect. But her writing was also influenced by her father, who was, political, revolutionary, and a social and educational reformer. He was part of the Dor Daim movement in Yemen, and orthodox stream that believed in expanding education, for women as well, developing independent thought, and moving away from superstition and ignorance. Her poetry melds both these influences with the reality of her own time and place, and her status within it. The political aspects of Serri's writing express left-ideology and issues relating to Mizrahi culture and identity in Israel. Her poetry collection, Seventy Wandering Poems (1983) combined beat generation stylings with Yemeni traditions and feminist expression. In her writing and in her activism, she began to create connections between the social struggle of the Mizrahim in Israel to the immorality of the occupation of Palestine, while as a Mizrahi feminist, outlining the patronizing, patriarchal attitudes of the Israeli left, in particular in her later collections, Sacred Cow (1990) and Red Heifer (1991). Serri founded a publishing house, Ha'Or Ha'Ganuz, after her poems were rejected by the mainstream publishers, who published Ashkenazi poets almost exclusively. The innovation of her work was reflected also in the design of the books she published. Her writing became highly intertextual, incorporating references from the Bible dealing with women, while pointing to the conditions of Mizrahi women living in the modern age who refuse to let go of their traditions. Her work also incorporates her social activism, similarly to her contemporary, Vicki Shiran, and Jewish themes, like the poet Haviva Pedaya. Her writing is considered interdisciplinary, postmodern, and feminist. Her work was included in the anthology of Mizrahi poetry, One Hundred Years, One Hundred Writers: A Collection of Hebrew Poems by Mizrahi Poets of the 20th Century, edited by Sami Shalom Chetrit (1980). Her poems have also been anthologized in The Tribe of Dinah (1989). From the beginnings, in which her work was refused by publishers, Serri has become an important figure in the study and criticism of Israeli poetry, in recognition of her important literary contribution. == Works == * Seventy Poems of Wandering שבעים שירי שוטטות, ירושלים: הוצאה עצמית, 1983. * Red Cow פרה אדומה, תל אביב: הוצאת ברירות, 1990. * Sanctification (Book of Covenant and Grace, part 1) קידושין (ספר הברית והחסד – חלק א'), ירושלים: הוצאת האור הגנוז, 2000. * Nurit: Lessons in the Discipline of Work (Book of Covenant and Grace, part 2) נורית: שיעורים בתורת העבודה (ספרי הברית והחסד – חלק ב'), ירושלים: הוצאת האור הגנוז, 2001. * Prayers and Silences תפילות ושתיקות (ספרי הברית והחסד – חלק ג'), ירושלים: הוצאת האור הגנוז, 2002. * Edna: Stopping and Voyaging in Fifty Gates עדנה: חניה ומסע בחמישים שערים, ירושלים: הוצאת האור הגנוז, 2005. * Wisdom בינה, ירושלים: הוצאת האור הגנוז, 2006. * Of Wine בת יין, ירושלים: הוצאת האור הגנוז, 2007. * Yakum Porkan יקום פורקן התש\\"ע, ירושלים: הוצאת האור הגנוז, 2011. * Illiterate: a collection of translated poems, Berkeley: Ha'Or Ha'Ganuz, 1995. == Awards == * 1998 – New Immigrant Excellence Award * 2009 – Prime Minister's Literature Award * 2011 – Libi BaMizrach (My Heart is in the East) Special Commendation == Additional reading == * בסוד ברכה : יצירתה של ברכה סרי Be-sod Berakhah : Yetsiratah shel Berakhah Serri In secret blessing : the poetry of Bracha Serri; Henriette Dahan Kalev; Jerusalem : Karmel, 2013. == References == == External links == * (archived) * * Category:Yemeni emigrants to Israel Category:Mizrahi feminists Category:Israeli women poets ","title":"Bracha Serri"},{"id":"60347065","text":"Pope Honorius III Vineae Domini custodes is a papal bull issued by Pope Honorius III on June 1225 granting two Dominican friars, Dominic of Segovia and Martin, authorisation for a mission to Morocco.Iben Fonnesberg-Schmidt, The Popes and the Baltic Crusades: 1147–1254 (Brill, 2007), p. 169.

It was built of wood in 1687 as a filial church of the Avraamiev Monastery marking the supposed place where the monastery's founder had met St. John the Theologian in the early 11th century. The church is an octagon with porches crowned by distinctive bochka roofs and a steepled bell tower set in front of the main building. It is the oldest wooden building in Yaroslavl Oblast and is open as a museum from May to September. In 1562 monk Isaiah from the Avraamiev Monastery carved the ornate royal doors that served as the main entrance to the altar. After the Russian Revolution, the church's original furnishings, including a set of old icons and the royal doors, have been taken to the Rostov Kremlin museum and replaced with replicas.

Mehul believes Babaida too reciprocates her feelings, as the otherwise calm and composed boy retaliates when somebody misbehaves with Mehul. A day, before holi, Babaida tells her that on holi he has something to convey her. She assumes that he is going to propose to her. On the day of holi, while she is waiting on the terrace (with abeer mixed with sindur vermillion), Babaida turns up with a beautiful girl and introduces Sayantika (Falaque Rashid Roy), his new girlfriend to whom he has recently proposed and the girl reciprocated. Babaida has been working with this girl in the same office and has also written his diary based upon her. Babaida puts the abeer on mehul and tells her, now she has to shoulder the responsibility of not just Babaida, but his better half too. Heartbroken Mehul puts the abeer on Sayantika and tells her from now onwards, she hands over Babaida's responsibility to her, and leaves. Now on, she starts avoiding Babaida, focusses on her studies. One day while returning home from school, a distressed Babaida meets her while she rudely answers to him, Babaida hands her a letter which Mehul takes quite reluctantly and goes home. Three months pass by. She eventually breaks Babaida's record in the boards. On the day of her result she gets the news of Babaida's suicide, rushes to his house and after watching Babaida's dead body, which is unbearable to her sight, she runs back home and breaks in tears. 4 years later, Mehul is seen working in a government company with low-paid salary with which she now has to sustain two households - one is her own and the other is Babaida's, where only Babaida's bedridden mother lives now. One day a colleague of Mehul, named Ananda encourages her to go to an ongoing interview in a big corporate company called Unicorn just opposite to their current office. Mehul goes there and after giving the interview she gets selected. She had tried for this job but has been rejected many a times. On the first day of her new job she meets the boss, Ranadeb (Gaurav Chakrabarty), who tells her to enjoy her life and be happy. The next day Mehul completely changes her attire to bold and voguish, by which her handsome boss Ranadeb seems to be swept off his feet. He tries different ways to get close to Mehul. Mehul also seems to reciprocate to his interest. Babaida's mother also dies in the meantime. One day Ranadeb invites her for dinner and in the process tries to sleep with her. Suddenly his phone rings and Mehul sees the one calling him is his wife, Sayantika, whom Babaida introduced as his ladylove. Ranadeb forces Mehul on bed and Mehul injures his head, suddenly the scene changes to Mehul running to a police station in her bare feet, with her clothes torn. She enters the police station, indicating that she has been raped and faints. It is only then, when the mystery behind Babaida's suicide starts unfolding. From the letter that he gave her, Mehul got to know that Babaida and Sayantika were friends since college. After passing engineering they both entered Unicorn as interns, along with few other friends. But Sayantika started to change after their boss Ranadeb began showing interest in her. Babaida would often find Sayantika and Ranadeb in a very close proximity in Ranadeb's cabin. One day after Babaida enters Ranadeb's cabin to confront him of an injustice done to one of his friends, only to find Sayantika and Ranadeb making out. Enraged, Babaida and Ranadeb have a little fight. Later on, Sayantika and Ranadeb conspires against Babaida, Sayantika runs to the police station in the same condition as Mehul is seen doing in the present situation. Sayantika falsely accused Babaida of raping her, for which Babaida had to face some legal charges. For a guy who had always been very studious and respectful towards women, that rape charge was too much to take, on the other hand his career was on the verge of ending. He couldn't take it and thus committed suicide. But before dying, he thought of Mehul and expected that only she would believe him as she loves him. Sayantika and Ranadeb married each other after Babaida's death. However, after the reason behind Babaida's suicide is revealed, Ranadeb is seen being arrested and, he and his wife Sayantika are charged with fraudulence. So by the end it was clear that Mehul entered the company with a motive to avenge Babaida's death. At the end Mehul speaks to Babaida's portrait and tells him that she is his wife as he colored her head with vermillion mixed gulal on the day of holi, four years ago. And being his wife, it was her duty to give him justice. == Cast == * Ritwick Chakraborty as Babai * Subhashree Ganguly as Mehul * Gaurav Chakrabarty as Ranadeb * Biswajit Chakraborty as Mehul's father * Laboni Sarkar as Babai's mother * Tulika Basu as Mehul's mother * Samiul Alam * Adrija Addy Roy as Tusu - Mehul's friend * Tithi Das * Adrit Roy as Ananda (Guest Appearance) * Falaque Rashid Roy as Sayantika (Guest Appearance) == Marketing and release == The official trailer of the film was unveiled by Raj Chakraborty Entertainment Pvt.

He served as governor of Tabaristan under the Umayyad viceroy of Iraq, Ubayd Allah ibn Ziyad and later as the governor of Mosul under the anti- Umayyad caliph Abd Allah ibn al-Zubayr. He died fighting for the latter's brother and governor of Iraq, Mus'ab ibn al-Zubayr, against the pro-Alid ruler of Kufa, Mukhtar al-Thaqafi, at the Battle of Harura in 686. His son, Abd al- Rahman, would later lead a major rebellion against the Umayyads in 700–703. ==Life== Muhammad was the son of al-Ash'ath ibn Qays, the leader of the Kindah tribe in Kufa, and succeeded him following his father's death in 661.Crone 1980, p. 110.Howard 1990, p. 19. His brother Qays also held a leadership position in the tribe. According to an account cited by 9th-century historian al-Tabari, the newly-installed Umayyad governor of Kufa, Ubayd Allah ibn Ziyad, charged Muhammad with summoning the man hiding the pro-Alid dissident Muslim ibn Aqil to the governor's palace. Ibn Aqil had been rallying Kufan support for Husayn ibn Ali, a son of Caliph Ali () and grandson of the Islamic prophet Muhammad, who refused to recognize Caliph Yazid I (r. 680–683). Muhammad later played a key role in defending Ibn Ziyad when supporters of Ibn Aqil besieged the governor.Howard 1990, pp. 49–50. Muhammad ultimately forced Ibn Aqil to surrender and agreed to send a letter on the latter's behalf notifying Husayn not to come to Kufa, where he was expecting significant support.Howard 1990, pp. 55–56. Muhammad married off his daughter to Ibn Ziyad. The latter appointed him governor of Tabaristan, but following Ibn Ziyad's flight to Syria in the wake of Caliph Yazid's death and the subsequent collapse of Umayyad authority, Muhammad recognized the rival, Mecca-based caliphate of Abd Allah ibn al-Zubayr. Ibn al-Zubayr appointed him governor of Mosul. In response to the suppression of the Arab nobility of Kufa by the pro- Alid leader al-Mukhtar al-Thaqafi in 686, Muhammad, who at the time was residing in one of his fortresses near Qadisiyya, known as Tizanabadh, rallied to the Zubayrid governor of Basra, Mus'ab ibn al-Zubayr.Fishbein 1990, pp. 85–86 During the Battle of Harura he was installed as the leader of Kufan troops, who had earlier defected from the pro-Alid leader al-Mukhtar. He was ultimately slain during the battle under unclear circumstances, with up to four different narratives recorded in the Muslim tradition regarding the identity of his killer.Fishbein 1990, p. 95. The Zubayrids won the battle, but the death of Muhammad was lamented by Mus'ab, who remarked to his lieutenant commander, al-Muhallab ibn Abi Sufra, \\"what a joy it would have been, had Muhammad ibn al-Ash'ath not been killed!\\"Fishbein 1990, p. 100. ==References== ==Bibliography== * * Category:686 deaths Category:7th-century Arabs Category:People of the Second Fitna Category:Kinda Category:Governors of the Umayyad Caliphate Category:Military personnel killed in action ","title":"Muhammad ibn al-Ash'ath al-Kindi"},{"id":"60347563","text":"Vanotek (born Ion Chirinciuc) is a Moldovan-born Romanian record producer and disc jockey.

The Armed Forces March Competition was conceived of by the U.S. Department of Defense and ASCAP to commemorate the 1954 centenary of his birth. The competition solicited original military marches from personnel of the United States Army, United States Air Force, United States Navy, and United States Marine Corps, with one entry selected from each participating force to receive an ASCAP-John Philip Sousa Award and a prize of $1,000. Entries were restricted to those composed by persons on active duty for 90 days or more by the entry deadline and only previously unpublished marches were accepted. ==Judging and winners== Three-person judging panels were convened to choose each of the four winners from out of 137 submitted entries, with the first round of judging taking place in Washington, D.C. and the second round at West Point, New York. Among the judges were Albertus L. Meyers and Frank Simon, at the time the only two still-living cornet soloists to have been commanded by Sousa. The winning compositions were: representing the Navy, the \\"White Hat March\\" by Gerard Bowen; representing the Air Force, \\"Thunderjet March\\" by Lawrence M.

Records. The album's two singles, \\"Live for Today\\" and \\"Dance with Me\\", reached #91 and #85 on the UK Single Chart, respectively. Compared to the gothic post-punk of their eponymous debut album, Is Nothing Sacred? saw the band diversifying musically, incorporating new wave, classic rock and ska, along with synths, horns and a greater emphasis on the bass. == Critical reception == In a contemporary review for Sounds, Ralph Traitor gave the album 4 stars out of 5 and wrote: \\"This record is a sickening sell-out, a Miles Copeland sponsored nightmare, a defilement of street credibility, punk ethics and honest hard work and a rank plagiarism of James Jewel Osterburg, and I can't actually find any fault with it.\\" In a retrospective review, giving the album 3 stars out of 5, AllMusic's Bill Cassel wrote: \\"The shadow of the Rolling Stones, the classic role model for bands who embrace rock's scuzzy, dangerous, vaguely satanic side, looms large over Lords of the New Church's second album.\\" He felt that the influence of Mick Jagger on Stiv Bators' \\"lippy, sneering delivery\\" has never been more apparent and that Brian James emulates Keith Richards' \\"rhythm-oriented guitar parts.\\" Cassel commented that if it were a Rolling Stones album, \\"it'd be a pretty good one, well played and entertaining throughout.\\" He concluded that, \\"As a follow-up to the Lords' promising debut, Is Nothing Sacred? isn't a disaster, but it is a small step backward rather than forward.\\" On a more negative note, Ira Robbins of Trouser Press felt that the band ran out of material after the first song: \\"Following the excellent \\"Dance with Me,\\" the album rolls straight down the songwriting slope, stopping off only briefly to ram through the Grass Roots' venerable \\"Live for Today\\" to no audible end.\\" He added that, as a soundtrack for a gothic punk horror film, Is Nothing Sacred? \\"gets the ambience right, but that's all it does.\\" == Track listing == == Personnel == Credits adapted from the album's liner notes. ;The Lords of the New Church *Stiv Bators – vocals *Brian James – guitar, backing vocals *Dave Tregunna – bass, backing vocals *Nicky Turner – drums, backing vocals ;Additional musicians *Matt Irving (credited as \\"Matt Black\\") – synthesizer, keyboards *Steve \\"Rudi\\" Thompson – tenor saxophone, trumpet *Simon Lloyd – alto saxophone, trumpet *Todd Rundgren – synthesizer on \\"Live for Today\\" ;Technical *The Lords of the New Church – production *Stephen W.

An interesting feature of Eagle Mountain is a natural window officially named Goat's Eye located on the northeast ridge which leads many to call it Goat's Eye Mountain. It was first noted by George Simpson who wrote of it: \\"a very peculiar feature in an opening of about eighty feet by fifty, which, as we advanced nearer, assumed the appearance of the gateway of a giant's fortress.\\" ==Geology== Like other mountains in Banff Park, Eagle Mountain is composed of sedimentary rock laid down from the Precambrian to Jurassic periods. Formed in shallow seas, this sedimentary rock was pushed east and over the top of younger rock during the Laramide orogeny. ==Climate== Based on the Köppen climate classification, Eagle Mountain is located in a subarctic climate with cold, snowy winters, and mild summers.

Both Ridout and Jarvis were from the small circle of privileged insiders called upon by the Lieutenant Governors of Upper Canada, to fill administrative posts, and sinecures, that William Lyon Mackenzie would later brand the Family Compact. Ridout's father, Thomas Ridout, was Upper Canada's Surveyor General. Jarvis's father, William Jarvis, had been appointed Upper Canada's provincial secretary and registrar. During the War of 1812 Ridout served as a \\"confidential clerk\\" to his elder brother Thomas Gibbs Ridout, in the Army's Commissary Department. Ridout was studying law at the time of his death. According to Mike Filey, the author of a long-running local history column in the Toronto Sun, this was the last duel in York, the capital of Upper Canada. Jarvis, then 24, had owed debts to multiple individuals, including Ridout's father. When Ridout visited Jarvis to collect, blows were exchanged. Jarvis challenged Ridout to a duel, at dawn, on July 12, 1817. The rules for this particular duel were that Ridout and Jarvis would face away from one another, then each stride 8 paces, turn around, wait out a count of three, then fire. Ridout fired early, at two - but missed. This turned out to be a wrinkle the duelists seconds hadn't anticipated. However, they agreed that Ridout would now have to stand, unarmed, while Jarvis took his shot. While Ridout's autopsy would conclude that Ridout was killed immediately by a shot to his jugular and windpipe, Jarvis and the seconds told authorities that Ridout had lived long enough to forgive Jarvis and absolve him of responsibility. Jarvis was initially charged with murder. His charges were later reduced to manslaughter. He was acquitted. Twentieth Century commentators characterize Jarvis's acquittal as typical hypocrisy of privileged individuals, closing ranks to protect their peers. ==References== Category:Upper Canada Category:1817 deaths Category:Duelling fatalities ","title":"John Ridout"},{"id":"60348306","text":"Dell'Agnello is an Italian surname.

The BPA established the Covington Substation in 1940-1942, one of fourteen substations in the original \\"master grid\\". The Covington site was cleared as a Works Progress Administration (WPA) project. Coming online on March 3, 1942, the Covington Substation connected the electrical systems of Seattle City Light and Tacoma City Light. When the BPA decided to connect the grid to the Coulee Dam as well, providing redundancy in case of national emergency, a line was built over the Cascade Mountains linking the Coulee Dam to the Covington Substation. The main structures are built in Streamline Moderne style, common in industrial design at the time. The structures that contribute to the Historic designation are the untanking tower, control house, switchyard, heavy machinery and equipment maintenance (HMEM) shop (added in 1953), communication building (added in 1958), automotive storage building (added in 1959), maintenance warehouse (added in 1959), control house flammable storage (added in 1966), microwave tower (c. 1966), and engine generator building (added in 1973). The most visible structure is the untanking tower, which services the oil-filled transformers in the switchyard. Unlike typical BPA substations where the oil pumps would be housed in a separate structure, the oil pumps at the Covington Substation were in the basement of the untanking tower.

To stop the Muslim League to form the government in Punjab Indian National Congress and Shiromani Akali Dal extended their support to Unionist Party. Malik Khizar Hayat Tiwana resigned on 2 March 1947 against the decision of Partition of India. The Punjab province was a key battleground in the 1946 Indian provincial elections. The Punjab had a slight Muslim majority, and local politics had been dominated by the secular Unionist Party and its longtime leader Sir Sikandar Hayat Khan. The Unionists had built a formidable power base in the Punjabi countryside through policies of patronage allowing them to retain the loyalty of landlords and pirs who exerted significant local influence. For the Muslim League to claim to represent the Muslim vote, they would need to win over the majority of the seats held by the Unionists. Following the death of Sir Sikander in 1942, and bidding to overcome their dismal showing in the elections of 1937, the Muslim League intensified campaigning throughout rural and urban Punjab. A major thrust of the Muslim's League's campaign was the increased use of religious symbolism. Activists were advised to join in communal prayers when visiting villages, and gain permission to hold meetings after the Friday prayers. The Quran became a symbol of the Muslim League at rallies, and pledges to vote were made on it. Students, a key component of the Muslim League's activists, were trained to appeal to the electorate on communal lines, and at the peak of student activity during the Christmas holidays of 1945, 250 students from Aligarh were invited to campaign in the province along with 1550 members of the Punjab Muslim Student's Federation. A key achievement of their religious propaganda came in enticing Muslim Jats and Gujjars from their intercommunal tribal loyalties. In response, the Unionists attempted to counter the growing religious appeal of the Muslim League by introducing religious symbolism into their own campaign, but with no student activists to rely upon and dwindling support amongst the landlords, their attempts met with little success. To further their religious appeal, the Muslim League also launched efforts to entice Pirs towards their cause. Pirs dominated the religious landscape, and were individuals who claimed to inherit religious authority from Sufi Saints who had proselytised in the region since the eleventh century. By the twentieth century, most Punjabi Muslims offered allegiance to a Pir as their religious guide, thus providing them considerable political influence. The Unionists had successfully cultivated the support of Pirs to achieve success in the 1937 elections, and the Muslim League now attempted to replicate their method of doing so. To do so, the Muslim League created the Masheikh Committee, used Urs ceremonies and shrines for meetings and rallies and encouraged fatwas urging support for the Muslim League. Reasons for the pirs switching allegiance varied. For the Gilani Pirs of Multan the over-riding factor was local longstanding factional rivalries, whilst for many others a shrines size and relationship with the government dictated its allegiance. Despite the Muslim League's aim to foster a united Muslim loyalty, it also recognised the need to better exploit the biradari network and appeal to primordial tribal loyalties. In 1946 it held a special Gujjar conference intending to appeal to all Muslim Gujjars, and lifted its ban on Jahanara Shahnawaz with the hope of appealing to Arain constituencies. Appealing to biradari ties enabled the Muslim League to accelerate support amongst landlords, and in turn use the landlords client-patron economic relationship with their tenants to guarantee votes for the forthcoming election. A separate strategy of the Muslim League was to exploit the economic slump suffered in the Punjab as a result of the Second World War. The Punjab had supplied 27 per cent of the Indian Army recruits during the war, constituting 800,000 men, and representing a significant part of the electorate. By 1946, less than 20 per cent of those servicemen returning home had found employment. This in part was exacerbated by the speedy end to the war in Asia, which caught the Unionist's by surprise, and meant their plans to deploy servicemen to work in canal colonies were not yet ready. The Muslim League took advantage of this weakness and followed Congress's example of providing work to servicemen within its organisation. The Muslim League's ability to offer an alternative to the Unionist government, namely the promise of Pakistan as an answer to the economic dislocation suffered by Punjabi villagers, was identified as a key issue for the election. On the eve of the elections, the political landscape in the Punjab was finely poised, and the Muslim League offered a credible alternative to the Unionist Party. The transformation itself had been rapid, as most landlords and pirs had not switched allegiance until after 1944. The breakdown of talks between the Punjab Premier, Malik Khizar Hayat Tiwana and Muhammad Ali Jinnah in late 1944 had meant many Muslims were now forced to choose between the two parties at the forthcoming election. A further blow for the Unionists came with death of its leading statesman Sir Chhotu Ram in early 1945. ==Results== In the Punjab, the concerted effort of the Muslim League led to its greatest success, winning 75 seats of the total Muslim seats and becoming the largest single party in the Assembly. The Unionist Party suffered heavy losses winning only 20 seats in total. The Congress was the second largest party, winning 43 seats, whilst the Sikh centric Akali Dal came third with 22 seats. ==Government formation== A coalition consisting of the Congress, Unionist Party and the Akalis was formed in Punjab. Ishtiaq Ahmed has given a well documented account of how the Coalition Government in the United Punjab collapsed as a result of a massive campaign launched by the then Punjab Muslim League. AIML (Punjab) deemed the coalition government as a 'non- representative' government and thought it was their right to bring such government down (notwithstanding the fact that it was a legal and democratically elected government). AIML (P) called for a 'Civil Disobedience' movement (which was fully backed by Mr. Jinnah and Mr. Liaqat Ali Khan, after they had failed to enlist Sikh's support to help form an AIML led government in Punjab). This led to bloody communal riots in Punjab during the later part of 1946. By early 1947, Law and order situation in the Province came to such a point where civil life was utterly paralysed. It was under such circumstances that the coalition Punjab Premier (Chief Minister) Mr. Khizer Haya Tiwana was forced to resign, on 2 March 1947. His cabinet was dissolved the same day. As there was no hope left for any other government to be formed to take the place of the Khizer government, the then Punjab Governor Sir Evan Jenkins imposed Governor's rule in Punjab on 5 March which continued up to the partition day, that is 15 August 1947. Akali-Dall Sikkhs who, with 22 seats, were major stake-holders in the coalition along with Congress(51) and the Unionist Party (20), were infuriated over the dissolution of the Khizer Government. It was in this backdrop that on 3 March 1947, Akali Sikh leader Master Tara Singh brandished his Kirpan outside Punjab Assembly saying openly 'down with Pakistan and blood be to the one who demands it'. From this day on wards, Punjab was engulfed in such bloodied communal riots that the history had never witnessed before. Eventually, Punjab had to be partitioned into the Indian and Pakistani Punjab. In the process, over a million of innocent people were massacred, millions were forced to cross-over and to become refugees while thousands of women were abducted, raped and killed, across all religious communities in Punjab. ===Interim Assembly (1947-1951)=== On 3 June 1947 the assembly which was elected in 1946 divided into two parts. One was West Punjab Assembly and other was East Punjab Assembly to decide whether or not the province of Punjab be partitioned. After voting on both sides, partition was decided. Consequently, the existing Punjab Legislative Assembly was also divided into West Punjab Legislative Assembly and the East Punjab Legislative Assembly. The sitting members belonging to the Western Section subsequently became the members of the new Assembly renamed as the West Punjab Legislative Assembly. ====East Punjab==== The sitting members belonging to the Eastern Section subsequently became the members of the new Assembly renamed as the East Punjab Legislative Assembly. The members which were elected in 1946 election on the ticket of Shiromani Akali Dal and Unionist Party after Partition all joined the Indian National Congress. There were a total of 79 members.page xxviii-xxix of Punjab Vidhan Sabha Compendium . Retrieved on 12 January 2019. On 15 August 1947 Gopi Chand Bhargava was elected the Chief Minister of East Punjab by the members of the interim assembly. On 1 November 1947, the interim assembly sat for the first time. Kapur Singh was elected Speaker on the same day and 2 days later (on 3 November), Thakur Panchan Chand was elected Deputy Speaker.

He specializes in Penal Law and Press Rights law. == Biography == Frank Berton was born in 1962 in Amiens, France. Berton had a challenging childhood due to having a father who was violent towards him. Berton's father pressured him into going to business school. However, Berton had always known he wanted to be a lawyer and pursued his ambitions. During 1989, Berton was admitted into Lille 2 University of Health and Law. Berton has been on many highly publicized cases throughout his career and has gathered a strong reputation for himself. Berton has been hailed, \\"défense des français à l'étranger\\" or defender of French citizens abroad. Berton has a family consisting of four kids and a wife. His wife Bérangère Lecaille is also a French lawyer. == Notable Cases == === L'Affaire d'Outreau === The Outreau trial was a 2004 court trial in France that ended with the imprisonment of 18 people. However, in the following trials and appeals, it was found out that one of the imprisoned had committed perjury and this led to the false imprisonment of 14 people (one passed away in jail). Frank Berton was the lawyer for Odile Marécaux during the trial and successful appeal. This case had international attention and was included in newspapers like, The New York Times. There have also been documentaries made about this judicial mishap, one of these documentaries is called \\"Outreau, Autopsie d'un Désastre\\" directed by Jacques Renard. === L'Affaire Cottrez === The Affaire Cottrez was a large scandal where a French woman, Dominique Cottrez, was accused of committing the crime of infanticide. Cottrez was sentenced to 9 years in prison after being found guilty of killing 8 kids, 6 of which were found in her garage. Cottrez claimed that the children were born as a result of incest without her consent by her own father, which is why she ended their lives. Frank Berton along with Marie-Hélène Carlier were Cottrez's lawyers. In 2018, after serving part of her sentence, it was decided she was no longer a risk and she was free to be released. === Salah Abdeslam === Salah Abdeslam is suspected of being the only surviving terrorist that facilitated the November 2015 Paris attacks. Frank Berton was one of the lawyers that represented Salah Abdeslam. This was a highly publicized case due to the fact that 130 French people were killed in over 6 coordinated incidents. Berton made many public appearances during the trials and even invited to interviews with news sources like, France Info. This case is increasingly notable for Berton because in the face of incredible hatred and blame from the public towards Salah Abdeslam, he stood firm in his opinion that until a person is found guilty, he still deserves the right of a defense. Salah was found guilty and sentenced to 20 years of prison time at the end of court proceedings. Salah Abdeslam was held in custody with 24/7 surveillance, and this led to his refusal to talk to anyone, including his lawyers, in protest. This caused both Berton and his other lawyers to stop representing him. === Affaire Air Cocaïne === On the 20th of March, 2013, four French citizens were arrested in Punta Cana International Airport in the Dominican Republic. The police seized around 700 kg (1543 lbs) of Cocaine from their airplane. The scandal was named Affaire Air Cocaïne, or Air Cocaine Scandal by the media. Frank Berton and Philippe Screve were the defendants' lawyers. The trial ended with the four French citizens being sentenced to 20 years of prison time. == Autobiography == Frank Berton has an autobiography about his life and career that is set to come out in 2019. The book was written in collaboration with Elsa Vigoureux and the L'Obs. Berton has given some insight into the contents and has revealed that his work on high profile cases, like with Salah Abdeslam, will be detailed. == References == Category:1962 births Category:Living people Category:French lawyers Category:21st-century French lawyers Category:People from Amiens ","title":"Frank Berton"},{"id":"60348523","text":"Dumitru Mazilu (born 24 June 1934) is a Romanian politician. He had a key role in the events of the Romanian Revolution of December 1989 and in exposing the human rights abuses of the Ceaușescu regime. ==Professional career== Mazilu was born in Bacău. In 1952, he graduated from the Technical School of Engineers in Bacău. The same year, he became a security officer and was promoted to the rank of lieutenant. In 1959, Mazilu graduated from the University of Bucharest with a law degree, obtaining a PhD in the same field in 1964. As Mazilu attempted to obtain a PhD, he worked as a professor of law at Ștefan Gheorghiu Academy in Bucharest. From 1965–1966, Mazilu served as Director of Securitate in Băneasa.Actuala Academie de Poliție Alexandru Ioan Cuza, la care va continua să predea și după 1989, din 1999 în 2011 According to the Report Armageddon VII of 2004, it is claimed that Dumitru Mazilu had been dismissed from the management of Securitate officers as a result of an attempt to falsify documents relating to a car accident. From 1965–1968, Mazilu was responsible for investigating abuses and irregularities committed during the regime of Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej. In the 1970s, Mazilu's academic career further expanded. In 1970, he was established as a university professor by the Ministry of Education. In the years 1970–1974, he was the scientific director of the Institute of Political Sciences in Bucharest. In 1974, he gained admiration from American universities such as Harvard, Columbia and UCB. This attention from foreign institutes solidified Mazilu's position in Romanian diplomacy. This led to Mazilu's position as a legal adviser at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. ==Political dissidence in Ceaușescu's Romania== In 1985, Mazilu became involved in discussions of human rights and of the youth of the world. At this point in time, expectations that Mazilu wrote a report critical of the situation of human rights in Romania. Nicolae Ceaușescu was informed by secret services that Mazilu intended to publish the report. Ceaușescu forbade Mazilu to leave the country in order to prevent him from presenting the report to the United Nations Organization. The report detailed Ceaușescu's policy of exporting the majority of Romania's food, and lowering living standards in order to quickly pay off foreign debts. This was the case especially for those who lived near the construction site of Ceaușescu's planned place who were forcefully placed into hastily constructed apartment blocks that lacked electricity and running water, when in contrast, Ceaușescu lived in extravagant wealth. Mazilu furthered criticized Ceaușescu's agricultural policy of destroying traditional farming centers in an effort to modernize Romania's farming industry with the introduction of more modern agricultural centers, claiming that this compromised peasant farmers as their farms were seen by Ceaușescu's administration as \\"breeding (grounds) of bourgeois liberalism that still (perpetuate) forms of private property\\"https://www.nytimes.com/1989/08/30/world/smuggled-rights-report- indicts-ceausescu.html. From the years 1986–1989, Mazilu was placed under house arrest as a result of his criticisms of Ceaușescu's handling of human rights. As a result of Mazilu's critical report of Human Rights in Romania, he was formally fired from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in 1987 and his diplomatic passport was withdrawn, preventing him from attending UN meetings. In May of the same year, Ceaușescu had a letter written to the UN which claimed that Mazilu had suffered a heart attack and was seriously ill.United Nations Chronicle nr. 4/1998 - Defending ... The Universal Declaration of Human Rights Dumitru Mazilu wrote a letter to the Secretary-General of the United Nations stating that he had been hospitalized twice, being forced to withdraw from a summit on 1 December 1987, stating that he would not withdraw his report. The next year, the UN Subcommission to request Mazilu's release. In response, Ceaușescu stated that Mazilu's detention was in accordance with Romanian law and that placing Mazilu on the diplomat list was redundant due to his illness, thus denying the requests of the UN. However, despite being under house arrest, Mazilu was able to publish a clandestine report to the Geneva in April 1989. The report was published by the United Nations in July of the same year. This report was similarly critical, stressing conditions of extreme hunger, cold and fear in Romania . Despite repeated attempts by the UN to free Mazilu, he remained under house arrest. In September 1989, four diplomats from the embassy of the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, the United States of America and Canada were prevented by the Securitate to visit Mazilu. Several radio stations including the BBC, Deutsche Welle and Radio France Internationale brought attention to the situation. The United Nations eventually decided to take the situation to the International Court of Justice in the Hague.Secretarul General al Națiunilor Unite către Președintele Curții Internaționale de Justiție de la Haga : Înaintare a unei cereri de Aviz consultativ în cazul Dumitru Mazilu The subsequent hearing was held in October 1989 and in December 1989, Decision No 81/15 demanded that the Romanian authorities release Mazilu immediately and was voted upon unanimously, underling that Mazilu was to enjoy the diplomatic immunity of the United Nations as provided by Article 22 of the UN Convention on the privileges and immunities. ==During the Romanian Revolution== On the night of December 21, in the midst of the Romanian Revolution, Mazilu was moved to prison along with his wife and son by the Securitate. The following day, after the Ceaușescu regime was overthrown and Mazilu and his family were released.

After his speech was broadcast on television, Dumitru Mazilu was appointed Vice President of the National Salvation Front, which took power after Ceaușescu's removal. The FSN proclamation read by Ion Iliescu on the 22 of December 1989 was written by Dumitru Mazilu with some editing by Silviu Brucan. Despite this brief cooperation, tensions between Mazilu and Iliescu began as a result of the big tent ideology adopted by the FSN to present a united front against Nicolae Ceaușescu. Brucan and Iliescu believed that Communism should be kept in place, but Ceaușescu should be removed, whereas Mazilu believed that Communism was inherently flawed and was in need of replacement by Capitalism and Petre Roman believed that Socialism was Communism's natural replacement. These tensions culminated when during a march of remembrance for the fallen of the revolution on January 12, 1990, Mazilu attempted to use the dissatisfaction of the crowd to seize leadership of the FSN from Iliescu. His attempt, which included him jumping on top of a tank and shouting, \\"death to the former Securitate officers!\\" was largely unsuccessful apart from the removal of a few former Communist activists from the leadership of the FSN. After Dumitru Mazilu's failure to gain prominence as a leader in the National Salvation Front, the newspaper, Free Romania published a piece made up of information from Mazilu's political biography. The information in the piece was largely about his past under the regime of Gheorghe Gheorghiu- Dej. After being discredited from public opinion, Mazilu resigned from the leadership of the FSN on January 26, 1990, accusing the Communist practices within the political framework of the new political power of Stalinism. In March 1991, Dumitru Mazilu was attacked in Geneva during the devastation of political parties in Bucharest, the assaults of various journalists and leaders of the opposition, and the murder of Ioan Petru Culianu in Illinois. The murder was celebrated by the new union of the Romanian far-right and far- left;Antohi; Savin; Tismăneanu, \\"Cei pe care...\\" according to Vladimir Tismăneanu: \\"[Culianu] he gave the most devastating indictment of the new union of far left and far right in Romania\\". As speculation that former Securitate officers were behind the assaults of various journalists and opposition leaders and Ioan Petru Culianu's murder,Anton, Ted. \\"The Killing of Professor Culianu\\", in Lingua Franca, Volume 2, No. 6 - September/October 1992 Mazilu came to understand that the Romanian authorities were likely behind his assault and were attempting to keep him silent as a centre-left political dissident who was critical of both far-right and far-left world views. ==Post- Revolution activity== After the revolution, Mazilu left for a time to Switzerland. In 1990, he was chosen as the chairman of the Romanian Institute for Human Rights and youth, reprising the duties of a role that he held previously toward the early days of his career. In the years 1991–1993, Mazilu won a lawsuit filed by the Romanian authorities regarding his improper firing from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs during the Ceaușescu regime. He obtained his previously held role which he had lost in 1986 at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Dumitru Mazilu in the United Nations Assembly, Vienna, 1997 Mazilu returned to diplomacy, becoming the head of Romania's diplomatic mission in the Philippines (1993 and 1994). Dumitru Mazilu was appointed as ambassador to the international organizations in Vienna, and later, Romania's representative to OSCE from 1994–1997. This saw another surge in Mazilu's diplomatic career. He held various positions of power including vice president of the United Nations Organization for the Development of Industry in 1995, vice president of the United Nations Commission for the peaceful uses of the cosmic space from 1995–1997, the chairman of the Working Group of the General Conference of the International Atomic Energy Agency from 1996–1997, vice president and president of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law from 1998–2000, member of the International Diplomatic Academy in 2002. Presently, Mazilu holds a position as a Professor consultant at Bucharest University and the author of several books. In 2003, Mazilu was nominated for a Nobel Peace Prize by the International Diplomatic Academy.DR. DUMITRU MAZILU The same year, he became a member of the Scientific Council of the United Nations for distance learning. In 2004, Ion Iliescu, who had apparently moved past their past differences, appointed him in the National College of the Institute of the Romanian Revolution. In December 2004 - the 15th anniversary of the revolution - there was a symbolic reconciliation between Dumitru Mazilu and Ion Iliescu, who with his cabinet had since adopted social democracy, thus quelling earlier ideological tensions between Mazilu and Iliescu. Dumitru Mazilu was introduced into the leadership of the Institute of the Romanian Revolution of December 1989. This institution is engaged in the study and study of the Romanian revolutionary process. In November 2013, Dumitru Mazilu was interviewed in the General Prosecutor's Office as a further investigation of the events of 1989 in light of accusations surrounding Ion Iliescu. \\"We hope to find the truth,\\" he commented. The following year, Mazilu testified against Iliescu, stating \\"I am certain now that revolutions are conceived by idealists, enacted by fighters and taken advantage of by opportunists\\". Due to his role in the revolution, Mazilu's comments have raised him criticism with some Iliescu supporters branding him a traitor in light of the recent charges against Iliescu and the revolution of 1989. Mazilu is fluent in English, French, Russian and Italian. ==Awards and Recognition== Dumitru Mazilu has been awarded the titles of Doctor Honoris Causa of both Romanian and foreign educational institutions, namely: American College of Switzerland (1991); Police Academy \\"Alexandru Ioan Cuza\\" of Bucharest (September 2002); International University \\"Albert Schweitzer\\" of Geneva (November 2002); Honorary Member of the academic Community of the University \\"George Bacvia\\" in September 2003; Doctor of Constanta University of Constanta (April 2006).

Kenya has an extensive record of political violence that has been ethnically mobilized and the exacerbation of militias supported by politicians. Kenya's tribal war did not start yesterday, it goes way back to the times of Jaramogi Oginga Odinga, where parties were formed based on one's tribe. Detrimental effects of the disputed general elections have been witnessed since time immemorial, that is from 1997, when Kenya's ruling party then, Kenya African National Unity (KANU) unleashed terror in order to coerce the citizens and to forge forward their devolution agenda. The Digo Community was mobilized to fight against the peoples of the Western and Central Part of Kenya. This resulted to the displacement of more than 10000 people and the death of 104 innocent civilians. Reports from the judiciary indicated the existence of vigilante groups funded the then ruling party led by Daniel arap Moi. Key among them was Jeshi La Mzee. There was a resurgence of conflict between the Kikuyu and the Kalenjin, that existed up until 2013. The party that took over power in 2002, the National Rainbow Coalition led by Mwai Kibaki, ensured that there was peace, not until 2005 when a referendum was held to vote for a newly drafted constitution. People across divided felt that the national coalition was divided into ethnic lines. This saw the Luo led by Raila Odinga break away to form the Orange Democratic Movement. The events that followed would see Kenya sink into a deep economic crisis as a result of the 2007/8 general elections. The Presidential elections were hotly contested between two main opponents Mwai Kibaki and Raila Odinga, however, Odinga disputed the results of the elections that declared Mwai Kibaki as the winner. He insisted that they were marred with mass rigging, theft and inconsistencies in the way they were conducted. This sparked what Kenyans would refer to as exemplifying Kenya as a \\"a cradle of violence\\" as the elections plunged Kenya into periods of blood shade and mass killings of innocent Kenyans. Animosity and enmity were at the peak along different ethnic divides. The observers, like the European Union, noted discrepancies in the election result, which ragged fury in people of the Luo Community who were ardent supporters of Raila Odinga a.k.a Baba. This period saw vigilante groups like Mungiki, American Maine, China Group clashing and terrorizing innocent civilians. More than 650000 were displaced as a result and around 1300 people lost their lives making this post-election skirmish to be the single most detrimental in Kenyan history. The International Criminal Court then instituted charges of crime and inciting of violence on six Kenyans, widely referred to as the \\"Ocampo Six\\", among them Uhuru Kenyatta and the incumbent deputy president of Kenya William Ruto. The preceding elections did not proof different, the general elections in Kenya in 2013 were bitterly contested by two rivals Uhuru Kenyatta of The National Unity and Raila Odinga of the Coalition of Reforms and Democracy. Uhuru was declared the winner, which Raila disputed due to the involvement of the Bio- metric Voter System, which he highlighted its drawbacks. CORD was calling for reforms in the conduct of elections to be free and fair and hence challenged Uhuru's election in the Supreme Court, which later upheld Uhuru's election. 2017 saw the same contestants face each other in an election that was widely presumed to have already been predetermined since the electoral systems were hacked. The Chief Technological Officer at the independent and boundaries electoral commission IEBC, Chris Msando, was murdered in cold blood, in a plot that seemed an assassination. There was a tension rose and therefore the outcome of the election was disputed by the NASA coalition led by Raila Odinga and Lawyers like Miguna Miguna since they felt the electoral commission's systems were compromised and hacked. The NASA Coalition proceeded to court to seek for the nullification of the elections, which the supreme court of Kenya led by chief justice declared null and void. A second election held, saw the NASA coalition not participate in them not until their irreducible minimums were met, hence went in favor of Kenyatta who garnered 98% of the vote. This fueled a period of unrest, with Odinga declaring himself as the People's President, leading to warring factions between the supporters of Uhuru and Odinga. This was followed by mass shootings in opposition areas, in the slums and Kisumu. These events gave rise to the now famous household name \\"The March 9th Handshake\\", that brought together two national leaders who put their differences aside to serve Kenyans, Uhuru Kenyatta, and Raila Odinga. Raila Odinga, former Prime Minister of the Republic of Kenya and Leader of Opposition. == The Handshake == At the wake of 9 March 2018, Kenyans woke to \\"life-changing\\" news through a rather unexpected event. News that the key leaders, Raila Odinga, and Uhuru Kenyatta, who were at the helm of the divisive politics and hurling insults at each other were putting their differences aside and uniting through a \\"Handshake\\". This was a public declaration to cease all hostilities and instead find a common ground in the interest of moving the country forward economically and politically. After a prolonged period of turmoil, Kenya was now up on its two feet. However, politicians allied to The National Super Alliance (NASA) felt that this was betrayal and that Raila had not consulted. In as much as Kenyans perceived it an act of leaders putting aside their egocentric interests aside, there was an element of betrayal that was brought out by this sudden union. This also sparked the 2022 presidential election, with now Raila joining the government, was Ruto's presidential bid in 2022 thwarted? Miguna Miguna, Kenyan lawyer deported to Toronto, Canada == Significance of the Handshake == Raila Odinga can now freely visit the backyard of Uhuru Kenyatta, Gatundu while Uhuru Kenyatta could in Kisumu without any animosity from the locals. Raila Odinga was appointed as Africa Union's High representative for Infrastructural Development, which has been attributed to the renewed good relations between him and Uhuru, that might have made Uhuru tip him for the job Members of Parliament who had hostility against each other announced an end to the same, that is, Embakasi East Member of Parliament, Babu Owino and Starehe's Charles Njagua. Activities of ‘National Resistance Movement’ also subsided despite attempts by its self-declared General Miguna Miguna, who was deported to Canada to revamp it. == References == Category:Politics of Kenya Category:Electoral violence Category:2007 riots Category:2008 riots Category:2007 in Kenya Category:2008 in Kenya Category:Political riots Category:Conflicts in 2007 Category:Conflicts in 2008 Category:December 2007 events in Africa Category:January 2008 events in Africa Category:February 2008 events in Africa ","title":"2018 Kenya handshake"},{"id":"60348737","text":"Lucy Alexander Winchester (born January 11, 1937) is a Kentucky socialite and farmer who served as the 14th White House Social Secretary during the entirety of the Presidency of Richard Nixon and First Lady Pat Nixon. == Early life and career == Winchester was born in Lexington, Kentucky as Lucy Moulthrop Alexander.

The opposition blamed the then-President, Raúl Cubas Grau, and also the strongman of Paraguayan politics of that time, Lino Oviedo for the assassination. Argaña's assassination provoked a series of demonstrations by opponents and supporters to Oviedo and the Cubas government, which culminated in clashes in which seven demonstrators opposed to the government died, which resulted in the resignation of Cubas from the presidency. ==Background== The background for the Marzo paraguayo can be traced back to the feud between two important Paraguayan caudillos at the time: Luis María Argaña and Lino Oviedo. Argaña had a long career in Paraguayan politics. He was a judge during Paraguay's long-lasting military dictatorship under Alfredo Stroessner, and served in a number of important national positions during previous administrations. He ran an ultimately unsuccessful bid for the Colorado Party nomination for President in the 1993 election. Senator and Colorado politician Juan Carlos Galaverna would state in 2008 that there was an electoral fraud (of which Galaverna took part) in the primaries to hand the victory to Argaña's opponent Juan Carlos Wasmosy, who would go on to win the Presidency. Argaña ran another bid for the Colorado ticket in the 1997 primaries, where he faced another strong contender: Lino Oviedo, a general who participated in the 1989 coup d'état that overthrew Stroessner from power, and later staged a failed coup attempt of his own in 1996. Argaña and Oviedo faced off in what was described by Paraguayan newspaper Última Hora as \\"the most energetic and exalted electoral campaign\\" of the Colorado Party. Argaña had the support of President Wasmosy, but still could not defeat Oviedo. However, soon after his victory, Oviedo was disqualified as a candidate after being found guilty and sentenced to jail for the unsuccessful 1996 coup attempt. Oviedo's running mate, Raul Cubas Grau, assumed the presidential nomination, and the Colorado Party formed an emergency ticket enlisting the rival of Oviedo, Argaña, to fill the position of candidate for Vice President. With a campaign slogan \\"Cubas al poder, Oviedo en libertad\\" (\\"Cubas to power, Oviedo in freedom\\"), they obtained in 1998 the victory with the highest percentage of votes since the end of Stroessner's tenure (and the only outright majority win) with 55% of votes over Domingo Laíno. Cubas Grau fulfilled his campaign promise; three days after his inauguration, he released Oviedo from jail. Despite an order from the Supreme Court of Paraguay in December 1998, Cubas refused to send Oviedo back to jail. In response, the Chamber of Deputies voted to charge Cubas with abuse of power in February 1999, and began proceedings to start an impeachment process. ==Events== On the morning of 23 March 1999, Vice President Argaña was traveling from his residence, when minutes before 9:00 a.m. three men aboard a car intercepted his vehicle. The men descended from their vehicle and opened fire on Argaña's car. Argaña was transferred to a local hospital, where he was officially announced dead. At the time, Argaña was accompanied by his driver, Víctor Barrios Rey, and his assigned bodyguard, police sub-officer Francisco Barrios González; Barrios González was killed in the attack, while Barrios Rey was injured but survived. The event moved the country. Supporters of Argaña along with opponents of the Cubas Grau government blamed Oviedo and Cubas Grau for the assassination, and demanded the resignation of Cubas Grau and the imprisonment of Oviedo. Soon, a multisectoral organization had been formed with the participation of organizations such as Jóvenes por la Democracia, Paraguay Jaipotava (\\"The Paraguay That We Want\\"), Youth Parliament, and the Colorado movement that supported Argaña, Reconciliación Colorada (\\"Colorado Reconciliation\\"). Also present were the Social Ministry of the Paraguayan Catholic Church, students of the Faculty of Philosophy of the National University of Asunción and some Paraguayan unions. A march to the Palacio de los López the same day of the assassination was contained by police, and in the afternoon was victim of a strong police repression, with protesters taking refuge in the squares of the Congress. The Minister of the Interior, Rubén Arias, resigned and was replaced by retired Captain Carlos Cubas, brother of President Cubas. On 24 March, in an extraordinary session, the Chamber of Deputies overwhelmingly voted to impeach President Cubas. President Cubas announced that he ordered the arrest of Oviedo to comply with his sentence for the 1996 attempted coup d'état, which was seen as a last-ditch effort to stay in office; Cubas said that Oviedo volunteered. Oviedo went to the barracks of the Presidential Escort Battalion, but clarified that he did not consider himself a detainee, but rather voluntarily presented himself to clarify his legal situation. In the square in front of the Congress, opponents and supporters to Oviedo began to group. Both sides were separated by the police, establishing a neutral space between the groups. There were constant confrontations between the opposition demonstrators and the government supporters. The situation remained for the next two days as the protesters followed the impeachment proceedings. On 26 March, a clash broke out between opposition demonstrators and supporters of the government and police forces. A strong combined repressive action by the police forces succeeded in evicting the opposition demonstrators from the square, forcing them to retreat to the vicinity of the Metropolitan Cathedral. The Oviedistas occupied the entire sector for a few minutes, as the opposition entered the square again, attacking with stones and sticks, and succeeded in driving the supporters of the government and the police out of the place. Several cars were overturned or burned to form barricades and fortify the square. President Cubas ordered that the Armed Forces go out to impose control. A dozen tanks and troops of the Cavalry moved towards the center of Asunción, but the barricades prevented the entry to the squares. Tanks took positions in nearby areas. In the evening there was an attack by snipers located in buildings near the squares of the Congress or from nearby streets, killing seven demonstrators. With his political support having disappeared and facing near-certain conviction and removal by the Senate, Cubas Grau announced his resignation on the night of 28 March. He was succeeded by Luis Ángel González Macchi, who as President of the Senate was next in the line of succession. ==Conspiracy theories== Oviedo claimed that in the Metropolitan Cathedral of Asunción, weapons were placed at the disposition of demonstrators that were opponents to Oviedo. He stated \\"In the deposit of the Metropolitan Cathedral not only supplies were distributed, but also weapons and ammunition\\". Oviedo did not present evidence of his claims, and his statements caused widespread rejection of both the Paraguayan Catholic Church, the Association of Catholic Communicators (an organization of journalists) as well as various social and political leaders of Paraguay. Julio César Martínez, who claims to be an illegitimate son of Argaña, claimed that Argaña supposedly actually died the day before the assassination at the house of his mistress, and that his half-brothers conceived the assassination to take over the government. ABC Color journalist and ally of Oviedo, Hugo Ruiz Olazar, published a series of articles and interviews that were oriented to expose what he claimed were the \\"hidden truth\\" of the Marzo paraguayo. This series of articles contained claims such as that Argaña died the day before the assassination, and that the demonstrators shot in the square were shot from the roof of the Senate building. According to Olazar, all these statements led him to the conclusion that the Marzo paraguayo was a conspiracy designed to discredit Oviedo and Cubas Grau and overthrow the latter's government. ABC Color has been described as a media outlet close to Oviedo, and the articles and conclusions of Olazar have not been put to trial nor have the interviewees cited by Olazar offered their statements before the authorities. Claims that Argaña was already dead at the time the assassination took place were refuted by Argaña's sons, with his son Félix stating that he remembered that his father \\"woke up in good spirits\\" that morning, and that he made several calls from his cellphone. ==Aftermath== On the same day that Cubas Grau resigned, Oviedo escaped to Argentina, where he obtained political asylum. However, faced with pressures from different Argentine political sectors and the overt political activity of Oviedo, his asylum was withdrawn and Oviedo disappeared. Oviedo would resurface in Brazil, where he was arrested in June 2000. Oviedo would obtain asylum; from there, he began an intense political activity that led him to be accused of being the intellectual author of the protests against the Paraguayan government carried out mostly by his supporters, which led the government to decreed a state of emergency. The Brazilian government forbade him from engaging in any political activity, however, he defied the prohibition. In June 2004, Oviedo returned to Paraguay to face his charges both for the 1996 coup attempt and the Marzo paraguayo, and was immediately transferred to the Viñas Cue military prison. He was released on parole for good behavior on 6 September 2007, and between 2007 and 2008, both cases would be dismissed, with the judge who presided over the Marzo paraguayo case opined that it is not known where the shots came from that night. The dismissal was criticized by opposition leaders, who said it was part of an agreement between Oviedo and then-President Nicanor Duarte Frutos so that Oviedo could present himself as candidate for president in the 2008 elections and subtract votes from the opposition. Argaña's son, Félix Argaña, stated \\"I believe that nobody doubts that there is a political agreement behind all this; between Colorados both pro-government and dissidents; even Nicanor himself publicly praises Oviedo, and Oviedo returns the courtesy\\". Similar views were expressed by other leaders of the civil and political society of Paraguay, surprised that after nine years of process, many of those accused of being involved in the massacre alongside Oviedo were suddenly absolved. Oviedo died in a helicopter crash on 2 February 2013. On 23 October 1999, Pablo Vera Esteche was arrested in Paraguay. He said the murder, for which he and two other gunmen were paid a total of $300,000, was authorised by Cubas and Oviedo. Vera Esteche was sentenced to 20 years on 24 October (reduced to 18 years four years later). His accomplices were also jailed for lengthy sentences. ==In literature== The Marzo paraguayo appears in Paraguayan literature, especially in epic poetry. There are also novels and stories such as La noche de los francotiradores (\\"The Night of the Snipers\\"), a story by Catalo Bogado, and El país en una plaza (\\"The Country in a Square\\"), a novel by Andrés Colmán Gutiérrez. ==Legacy== The 2017 Paraguayan political crisis, in which a series of protests began in response to a constitutional amendment that would permit the President to run for re- election, during which demonstrators set fire to the Congress building, were sometimes referred to as \\"the second Marzo paraguayo\\" due to also taking place in March, or as \\"Cartes's Marzo paraguayo\\" in reference to then-President Horacio Cartes, whom the opposition and protesters held responsible for the crisis. ==References== Category:1990s in Asunción Category:1999 in Paraguay Category:1999 protests Category:Political history of Paraguay Category:March 1999 events in South America ","title":"Marzo paraguayo"},{"id":"60348825","text":"Lucas Alejandro Martínez Guanco (born 5 November 1998) is a Uruguayan footballer who plays as a midfielder for Juventud de Las Piedras in the Uruguayan Primera División on loan from Defensor Sporting. ==References== Category:1998 births Category:Living people Category:Juventud de Las Piedras players Category:Uruguayan Primera División players Category:Uruguayan footballers Category:Association football midfielders Category:People from Durazno ","title":"Lucas Martínez (footballer, born 1998)"},{"id":"60348828","text":"The House of Toys is a 1920 American silent drama film directed by George L.

In 1970 he graduated from the Faculty of Law of the Jagiellonian University. There, in 1974, he obtained a Ph.D. degree upon a dissertation written under the supervision of Kazimierz Opałek. In 1989 he obtained the title of professor of legal sciences. In 1978 he was a scholarship holder of Max Planck Gesellschaft in Hamburg, and in 1985−87 he held a scholarship of Alexander von Humboldt Stiftung in Göttingen. From 1988, he is the head of the Department of Legal Theory at the Faculty of Law and Administration of the Jagiellonian University. In the 1980s Gizbert- Studnicki participated in the work of the Citizens' Center for Legislative Initiatives of Solidarity. On December 14, 1981, the day after the martial law was introduced in Poland, Studnicki together with Krzysztof Płeszka and Tomasz Strzelczyk published a legal opinion in which they declared that the martial law had been introduced illegally. They signed themselves as \\"Lawyers from the Law Faculty of the Jagiellonian University\\", without specifying names. The three pointed out that, according to the then-Constitution of the Polish People's Republic, the Council of State could issue decrees only during intervals between the sessions of Sejm. In December 1981 the session of the Sejm lasted, therefore the Council of State did not have the right to issue a decree on the imposition of the martial law. Shortly after the publication, the opinion has been distributed by the Polish section of Radio Free Europe. As a result of publishing an opinion about the martial law, Gizbert-Studnicki was \\"one of the people traced particularly in detail by the Security Service\\" in the 1980s . He published a number of articles on analytical theory of law, including the theory of interpretation and legal argumentation, the theory of legal language and the analysis of legal concepts. He is a member of the Legal Commission of the Polish Academy of Learning. In the years 1995−1999 he was a member of the Executive Committee of the International Association of Legal and Social Philosophy. He was a promoter in ten completed doctoral programs. He was also a reviewer of several doctoral dissertations, a reviewer in several habilitation lectures and lines for the title of professor. He is the curator of the Association of Law Students' Library of the Jagiellonian University (TBSP) and the supervisor of the Science Club of the Philosophy of Law of TBSP, and also a tutor at Collegium Invisibile. In 1988, he founded a law firm, which ten years later has finally shaped into partnership T. Studnicki, K. Płeszka, Z. Ćwiąkalski and J. Górski (SPCG). Gizbert-Studnicki, as a counselor, specializes in company law and in transactions to acquire and merge companies, as well as in financing such transactions. He represented the SPCG's clients in several dozen transactions in this area, and as a Polish advisor he participated in several global M&A; transactions. He is currently a senior partner at SPCG. The SPCG Law Firm and lawyers occupy high positions in rankings and are recommended in international industry lists, among others in: Chambers Global, Chambers Europe, Euromoney − Deal Watch, Forbes, Legal 500, PLC Which Lawyer, IFLR 100 and Best Lawyers, which evaluate the legal services market in Europe and in the world. After the escalation of the 2015 Polish Constitutional Court crisis, Studnicki stated in a television interview that in his opinion Lech Morawski (one of the judges elected on the initiative and the votes of the deputies of Law and Justice party) \\"is a doubter, and his appointment to the Constitutional Court was not valid\\". == Awards == In the ranking of law firms of the Rzeczpospolita daily published in 2010, the law firm partnership T. Studnicki, K. Płeszka, Z. Ćwiąkalski and J. Górski was ranked ninth in Poland. In 2018, Gizbert-Studnicki was among thirty-nine lawyers and lawyers awarded the title of \\"Lawyer of the Thirty Years\\" by the Polish Union of Legal Employers and the Rzeczpospolita daily. == References == Category:Polish jurists Category:Jurisprudence academics Category:Jagiellonian University alumni Category:Jagiellonian University faculty Category:Fellows of Collegium Invisibile Category:1948 births Category:Living people ","title":"Tomasz Gizbert-Studnicki"},{"id":"60348973","text":"The 1912 Rice Grays football team was an American football team that represented Rice Institute as an independent during the 1912 college football season.

A gifted pianist, he was awarded a scholarship to the Chicago Musical College at age 12, but had to drop out due to a stammer. === Writing career === After a career as nightclub pianist, during which he accompanied Helen Morgan, Martin took up writing in his 30s. One short story was adapted into the 1940 Tex Ritter western film Pals of the Silver Sage. He published three books. His first, For Our Vines Have Tender Grapes, is about Norwegian-American farmers in a small Wisconsin community. He wrote part of the novel while he was employed by the Federal Writers' Project. Dalton Trumbo adapted the book for the MGM film Our Vines Have Tender Grapes in 1945. His estranged wife, Selma Martin, with Arnold Hansen, sued Martin after the film was released, claiming that the story was of her life and that its being told caused her to undergo undue attention and humiliation; the outcome of the lawsuit is unknown. Martin published two more novels: The Bells of St. Mary's, the novelization of the popular film, and Mark It with a Stone. In a largely positive review for The New York Times, Anne Richards wrote of its \\"freshness and vigor\\". According to Martin's obituary, he had submitted a manuscript for a book called Sans Sex and Murder to his agent shortly before he died, though it apparently never was published. === Death === On November 26, 1959, Martin committed suicide at Will Rogers Memorial Hospital in Saranac Lake, New York. He had suffered from tuberculosis for years, and friends had noticed he had been in a depressed moods at times. He was divorced and survived by a daughter, Sybil Penelope, at the time of his death. == Works == * For Our Vines Have Tender Grapes. Grosset & Dunlap, 1940.

As Japanese shipping losses mounted during World War II the Japanese began to organize their shipping into escorted convoys and they began arming their merchant ships to defend against attacks from Allied surface combatants, submarines and carrier-based aircraft. The 12cm/12 short naval gun was a multi-purpose gun introduced during 1941 which combined the roles of naval gun, anti-aircraft gun, coastal defense gun, and anti-submarine gun. == Design == The 12 cm/12 short naval gun was an autofretted monoblock gun with an interrupted screw breech that fired fixed QF ammunition. The trunnioned gun barrel had a hydro-spring recoil mechanism above and below the barrel and was mounted on a center pivot H/A L/A gun mount. The gun was normally mounted on merchant ships below 5,000 GRT and also saw use on land as a coastal defense gun on hills overlooking Japanese harbors and installations or as an anti- aircraft gun. It was described as being a light and easy to handle hand trained weapon that could be loaded at any angle by inexperienced gun crews. However, its rate of elevation/traverse 13° a second was considered too slow for effective anti-aircraft use. == Ammunition == * Anti-aircraft *Anti- submarine * High explosive - Length: , Weight: , Explosive weight: , Explosive: TNA. * Illumination * Incendiary * Shrapnel == Similar weapons == *20 cm/12 short naval gun - A similar Japanese anti-submarine gun used during the latter half of World War II. *BL 7.5-inch naval howitzer - A British anti- submarine gun used during the latter half of World War I. * 8 inch Mark 7 & Mark 8 - Two American anti-submarine guns designed late in World War I that never entered service. == References == ==External links== Category:Naval guns of Japan Category:120 mm artillery ","title":"12 cm/12 short naval gun"},{"id":"60349565","text":"The Spenders is a 1921 American silent comedy film directed by Jack Conway and starring Claire Adams, Robert McKim and Joseph J.

It is a broadly-distributed marine fish, found in waters in the bathypelagic zone. R. russelii is a scaleless, elongate and ribbonlike fish, growing up to 8 meters in length. == Taxonomy == Regalecus russelii is a member of the fish genus Regalecus and oarfish family Regalecidae. The genus currently includes only one other species of oarfish, Regalecus glesne. R. russelii is part of the order Lampriformes, which represents tube-eyes and ribbonfishes, and is part of the larger class of ray-finned fishes called Actinopterygii. == Anatomy and morphology == Regalecus russelii can grow up to 8 meters in length, and it has two dorsal fin crests that can reach 1 meter high. The species can be distinguished by its red dorsal fin crests, light brown head, and scaleless, silver body. The body is covered by dermal tubercles, which are concentrated along the ventral and lower side regions of the body. Each dorsal fin has 333 to 371 rays, which shorten and then become longer at the middle of the body. Its pelvic fin contains more than three membranous appendages and is a single elongated ray. The stomach has a long caecum, beginning posterior of the abdomen and extending to the end of the body. Muscle is contained in intermuscular septa, with dorsal and ventral septa along with teleost's characteristic horizontal, vertical, and transverse septa. Older R. russelii often have a posterior stump-like tail, which is a consequence of self-amputation but show no signs of regeneration. In some specimens, this tail appears jagged and unhealed, consistent with a fresh self-amputation. The majority of these fish have toothless jaws, but small vestigial teeth have been observed in some. There are 113 to 122 vertebrae present in the spine. The skeleton contains distinct areas of hyperostosis, or hyper-ossified bones, that are most prominent on the dorsal pterygiophores, but is also present on the cleithrum and along the supraoccipital bone. The rest of the skeleton is cartilaginous. The hyperostosis provides additional support to the pterygiophores during movement. The presence of hyperostosis varies among R. russelii of different ages and sizes; it is present in most large adult fish, and many smaller fish lack these regions of swollen bones. R. russeliis flaccid skeleton lacks mineralization, which is advantageous in maintaining buoyancy in deep waters. One of the few biological structures that has been studied is the otolith, which is a structure in the inner ear that is involved in sensing movement and gravity. R. russelii have very small sagittal otoliths that are difficult to observe; their small size may indicate that they play an insignificant role in sensing. Researchers have been able to perform CT scans and rare, invasive studies on this structure of a deceased R. russelii to better understand its physiological significance. == Distribution == Regalecus russelii lives in deep waters near areas such as Japan, California, and Baja California, in waters such as the Pacific, Atlantic, and Indian oceans. Since 1901, there have been 19 verified sightings and strandings along the coast of California waters. The R. russelii is found around the world equatorially, while the Regalecus glesne is found with antitropical distribution. The lack of live sightings of oarfish has made it difficult to determine the precise distribution of the Regalecus, and further research is needed. == Feeding and diet == The species uses a feeding stance to see the silhouette of its prey. It feeds on euphausiid crustaceans, small fishes and squid, and uses its protrusile jaws to suck in prey. The oarfish mostly consumes a diet of krill as its energy source, using its jaw to fill its oro-branchial cavity with the crustaceans, that will then be held in the gullet and passed through. == Conservation == There are no specific conservation measures for R. russelii, and it occurs in at least one marine protected area. It has been listed as 'Least concern' by the IUCN Red List. == Mythology == Two deep sea oarfish were caught live in nets off the coast of Okinawa, Japan January 28, 2019. Both died before making their way into an aquarium inland in the town Motobu. One fisher described the two oarfish squirming in the nets as looking like \\"real dragons.\\" A belief surrounds the species that they are \\"harbingers of earthquakes\\", but there is no scientific evidence or an association established between recorded oarfish sightings and earthquakes. Spread through Japanese myth, the oarfish has been described as \\"messenger from the Sea God's Palace.\\" Kiyoshi Wadatsumi, an expert in ecological seismology and director of e-PISCO, an organization which studies earthquakes, states that deep sea fish are more sensitive to the tectonic movements or tremors from active faults than fish closer to the surface of the ocean. == Parasites== * Gymnorhadinorhynchus mariserpentis Steinauer, Garcia- Vedrenne, Weinstein & Kuris, 2019 * Spinitectus gabata Poinar, Weinstein, Garcia-Vedrenne & Kuris, 2014 Despite the relatively limited number of oarfish researched, in 2014 scientists were able to discover a new species of nematode called Spinitectus gabata n. sp. (Spirurina: Cystidicolidae) within the gastrointestinal tract of a R. russelii off the coast of Japan. The S. gabata likely uses the krill the oarfish consumes as an intermediate host, since known Spinitectus species often involve crustaceans as intermediate hosts. == References == Category:Regalecidae Category:Fish described in 1816 ","title":"Regalecus russelii"},{"id":"60350145","text":"The UN offensive into North Korea was a large-scale offensive in late 1950 by United Nations (UN) forces against North Korean forces. On 27 September near Osan UN forces coming from Inchon linked up with UN forces that had broken out of the Pusan Perimeter and began a general counteroffensive. The North Korean Korean People's Army (KPA) had been shattered and its remnants were fleeing back towards North Korea. The UN Command then decided to pursue the KPA into North Korea, completing their destruction and unifying the country. On 30 September Republic of Korea Army (ROK) forces crossed the 38th Parallel, the de facto border between North and South Korea on the east coast of the Korean peninsula and this was followed by a general UN offensive into North Korea. Within one month UN forces were approaching the Yalu River, prompting Chinese intervention in the war. Despite the initial Chinese attacks in late October- early November, the UN renewed their offensive on 24 November before it was abruptly halted by massive Chinese intervention in the Second Phase Offensive starting on 25 November. ==Background== ===Strategic background=== The question of whether UN forces should cross the 38th Parallel, the dividing line between North and South Korea, became a most difficult one as soon as the Inchon landing succeeded and the Eighth Army broke out from the Pusan Perimeter. As a result of long and detailed consideration at high levels on the future course of action, the government in Washington decided Eighth Army should cross into North Korea. Pursuant to this decision, the Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) on 27 September sent to UN commander General Douglas MacArthur a comprehensive directive to govern his future actions. They stated that his first objective was to be the destruction of the North Korean forces. He was to unite all of Korea under Syngman Rhee if possible. But they warned him that he was not to consider the directive final since developments might require its modification. They particularly enjoined him to make special efforts to determine whether Soviet or Chinese intervention appeared likely, and to report any such threat to them at once. Subject to these injunctions, the directive stated that MacArthur's mission was \\"the destruction of the North Korean Armed Forces\\" and authorized him to conduct military operations for that purpose north of the 38th Parallel, provided that at the time there was no major Chinese communist forces or Soviet entry into North Korea or announced intention to enter in order to counter UN military operations there. The Joint Chiefs added that in no circumstances would any of the UN forces cross the Manchurian or Soviet borders of Korea and that non-Korean ground forces, as a matter of policy, should not be used in the area along the Manchurian border or in the northeast provinces bordering the Soviet Union. They instructed MacArthur to submit his plan for operations north of the 38th Parallel to them for approval. Thus the JCS in Washington held in their own hands final approval for any operation north of the 38th Parallel. Upon receiving this directive, MacArthur urged that the JCS remove the restriction requiring specific approval from the US Government before his forces crossed the 38th Parallel. He urged that he be allowed to cross the Parallel and seek out and destroy the remaining parts of the KPA if North Korea did not surrender in accordance with a proclamation he intended to issue. Two days later Secretary of Defense George C. Marshall sent him a personal message, marked for his eyes only, which stated that he should feel free tactically and strategically to proceed north of the 38th Parallel. President Harry Truman himself had approved this message. It is clear that on 29 September MacArthur had authority from the United States Government to cross the 38th Parallel. In a communication to the Secretary of Defense on 30 September, MacArthur said, \\"Unless and until the enemy capitulates, I regard all of Korea open for our military operations.\\" The next day, 1 October, in order to remove any obscurity that might still exist in Washington regarding his plan, MacArthur sent a message clearly stating his intentions. He said: I plan to issue and make public the following general directive to all elements of the United Nations Command at 1200 hours, Monday, 2 October, unless I receive your instructions to the contrary. \\"Under the provisions of the United Nations Security Council Resolution of 27 June, the field of our military operations is limited only by military exigencies and the international boundaries of Korea. The so-called 38th Parallel, accordingly, is not a factor in the military employment of our forces. To accomplish the enemy's complete defeat, your troops may cross the border at any time, either in exploratory probing or exploiting local tactical conditions. If the enemy fails to accept the terms of surrender set forth in my message to him of 1 October, our forces, in due process of campaign will seek out and destroy the enemy's armed forces in whatever part of Korea they may be located.\\" MacArthur stated later that the temporary UN halt at the 38th Parallel that occurred in early October was due to logistical difficulties. From the Communist side, certain storm signals appeared. In a speech in Beijing on 1 October, the first anniversary of the Chinese Communist state, Premier Chou En-lai warned that the Chinese people \\"will not tolerate foreign aggression and will not stand aside should the imperialists wantonly invade the territory of their neighbor.\\" This clearly was a threat to intervene in the Korean War if UN forces crossed the 38th Parallel. In the United Nations the Soviet delegate proposed on 2 October a plan which called for a ceasefire in Korea and the withdrawal of all foreign troops. The next day Sir Benegal Rau, the Indian delegate, stated his government's view that UN forces should not cross the 38th Parallel. The Indian view was undoubtedly influenced by a report to Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru from India's Ambassador to Beijing that China would enter the war if the UN forces crossed the Parallel. Meanwhile, MacArthur on 1 October issued his demand that North Korea surrender. He addressed his message to the Commander in Chief of the North Korean forces. He called upon the North Koreans to lay down their arms and cease hostilities under such military supervision as he might direct in order that the decisions of the UN might be carried out with a minimum of further loss of life and destruction of property, and to liberate UN prisoners of war and civilian internees. There was no answer from North Korea. On 9 October General MacArthur issued an ultimatum calling \\"for the last time\\" for North Korean surrender. There was no official response from North Korea to this demand, but Kim Il Sung in a radio broadcast in Pyongyang on the morning of 10 October, which was monitored in Tokyo, rejected it. ===UN plans for operations in North Korea=== As Eighth Army approached a linkup with X Corps near Seoul, Eighth Army commander General Walton Walker became concerned about the future relationship of Eighth Army and X Corps. He and his staff felt that X Corps should become part of Eighth Army and that all UN forces in Korea should operate under a unified field command. It is not known with certainty whether General Walker ever discussed with General MacArthur his own ideas about operations north of the 38th Parallel. It appears, however, that he never submitted them to him in writing. So far as is known, the nearest General Walker ever came to broaching the subject to MacArthur in writing was on 26 September when he sent a discreetly worded message to him suggesting that he would like to be informed of X Corps' progress and plans so that he could plan better for the approaching linkup of the two forces. General MacArthur dashed Walker's hopes in a reply the next day, informing him that X Corps would remain in Far East Command Reserve, in occupation of the Inchon-Seoul area ready to undertake a GHQ-directed operation \\"of which you will be apprised at an early date.\\" When General MacArthur flew to Seoul on 29 September to return the South Korean capital to the government of Syngman Rhee he already had formulated in his mind plans for the next phase of Korean operations. On 26 September, General Doyle O. Hickey, Deputy Chief of Staff, Far East Command had sent a check sheet to General Edwin K. Wright, Assistant Chief of Staff, G-3, Far East Command stating that General MacArthur wanted plans developed for further operations in North Korea which would employ the X Corps in an amphibious landing at Wonsan. Because the Far East Command's Joint Strategic Plans and Operations Group had kept active its studies for amphibious operations in areas other than Inchon, including one for a Corps-size landing in the Wonsan- Hamhung area of the east coast, it was only a matter of a few hours until General Wright had the outline of such a plan in MacArthur's hands. This plan proposed that the advance into North Korea would consist of a \\"main effort of Eighth Army on the west in conjunction with an amphibious landing at Wonsan or elsewhere.\\" This was the beginning officially of the Far East Command decision that led quickly to the establishment of two separate field commands in Korea for the next phase of the war, and which almost at once became the subject of controversy. For a period prior to 26 September, it appears that General MacArthur had intended to place X Corps under Eighth Army command once Seoul had fallen. Generals Hickey and Wright favored this course of action, and Maj. Gen. George L. Eberle, the Far East Command G-4, agreed with them. But apparently they did not actively advocate it to General MacArthur. Eberle held the view that although it would be possible to support X Corps logistically in an amphibious operation on the east coast, it could more easily be supported as part of Eighth Army. But if MacArthur ever had been uncertain on the future role of the X Corps, he had decided the point in his own mind by the last week of September. The reasoning which led General MacArthur to decide on two commands in Korea can best be understood by reference to the terrain map of North Korea and the problem of logistics. Above the Pyongyang-Wonsan corridor the northern Taebaek Range rises to rugged heights in the east central part of the peninsula, forming an almost trackless mountainous waste in the direction of the Manchurian border. The principal routes of travel follow the deep mountain valleys in a generally north-south direction. The only reasonably good lateral road from east to west in North Korea lay just north of the 39th Parallel, connecting Pyongyang with Wonsan, on the east coast. A rail line also crossed the peninsula here. Any plan for a military campaign north of the Pyongyang- Wonsan corridor in the interior of North Korea would encounter most difficult logistical and supply problems. In surveying the logistical problems attending any future military operations in Korea, General MacArthur had to note the condition of transport communications in South Korea. UN aerial action, together with KPA demolitions, had destroyed nearly all the rail and highway bridges north of the Pusan Perimeter. Weeks of concentrated work by all available Engineer troops would be required to repair the rail lines from the Pusan Perimeter to the 38th Parallel. Aerial action had also badly shattered the communication and transport system of North Korea. In considering this state of affairs, General MacArthur apparently decided that he could not supply both Eighth Army and X Corps from Inchon for a quick continuation of the pursuit northward. He also wanted to get military forces behind the North Koreans retreating from the Pusan Perimeter through the central mountains and up the east coast. MacArthur reasoned that a landing on the northeast coast might accomplish this. The base for operations in Korea actually was Japan. MacArthur believed that two separate forces co-ordinated from there could operate in Korea without impairing the effectiveness of either. Involved also in his decision was the idea of encirclement of the North Korean capital. While Eighth Army attacked north from the Seoul area toward Pyongyang, MacArthur's plan called for X Corps, upon landing at Wonsan, to drive west along the Pyongyang corridor and to take the city from the flank and rear. The first outline of the operational plan for the projected movement into North Korea set the target date for the Wonsan assault, for planning purposes, at twelve days after Eighth Army passed through the X Corps in the Seoul-Inchon area. It was thought that Eighth Army could initiate its attack three to seven days before the X Corps amphibious assault on Wonsan. General MacArthur approved this plan on 29 September. After the Far East Command plan to move X Corps by water to Wonsan became known to Eighth Army, Colonel Dabney, Eighth Army G-3, prepared a message to Far East Command setting forth a concept to replace it. This plan would have assigned X Corps to Eighth Army and provided for early movement against Pyongyang and Wonsan overland. The Eighth Army staff felt that the plan to load X Corps would unnecessarily delay pursuit of the defeated KPA and would impede the advance of Eighth Army northward. It also believed that the ROK advance on the east coast would capture Wonsan before X Corps could be landed there. Dabney took the message to General Walker who read it and said that he agreed with the plan, but that it was not to be sent to Far East Command. According to Dabney, Walker said he had already made his views known and had received contrary orders. In connection with the possible escape into North Korea of large numbers of enemy soldiers from the Pusan Perimeter, Eighth Army earlier had requested X Corps to block the central mountain route through Wonju and Ch'unch'on with at least a regiment, but X Corps had replied that it could not extend \\"the anvil\\" to that point. On 11 October a radio message from General MacArthur shattered any remaining hope Walker may have had of directing future operations in the east. It informed him that MacArthur intended to use Wonsan Airfield for land-based aircraft under X Corps control and that ROK I Corps in the east, then under Eighth Army control, would come under X Corps command as soon as X Corps landed. It appears that General Walker believed that X Corps, after the fall of Seoul, should continue the attack north to Pyongyang under Eighth Army command, with Eighth Army moving up behind it. He reasoned that this should save a lot of time as X Corps was already in position for continuing the attack in the west, and Eighth Army was not. In such an attack the Corps could continue to be supplied from Inchon. General Walker and most Eighth Army senior officers felt that not to continue the pursuit at once—to halt for a period of almost two weeks while X Corps loaded out at Inchon and Eighth Army moved into position below the 38th Parallel would permit the escape of a large part of the remaining North Korean forces retreating northward which might otherwise be destroyed or captured. In Walker's view, once X Corps reached Pyongyang, with or without Eighth Army help as the case might be, Eighth Army could then move laterally along the Pyongyang-Wonsan corridor to the east coast where it would join ROK I Corps already there and advancing northward. This plan contemplated X Corps continuing the attack in the west from Pyongyang toward the Yalu River. An alternative course would be for X Corps to cross to the east coast by the Pyongyang-Wonsan corridor, while Eighth Army attacked north from Pyongyang. The operations of both forces would be coordinated under Walker's command, and both would be supplied from Inchon and Pusan and by airlift until Wonsan fell. Then the force operating in the east could be supplied largely by sea through that port and Hungnam farther to the north. Generals Hickey, Wright, and Eberle of MacArthur's staff favored such a plan of operations. Admiral C. Turner Joy, Commander, NAVFE, and key members of his staff, had objected to the Wonsan amphibious operation as being unnecessary, holding the view that X Corps could march overland from Seoul to Wonsan much faster than it could be lifted and landed there by water. General O.P. Smith, commanding the 1st Marine Division, had many reservations about the proposed operations of his division in northeast Korea. The prediction of the Eighth Army commander and staff that Wonsan would fall to ROK I Corps before the X Corps could land there became a fact on 10 October and their view that the North Korean capital of Pyongyang would also fall to Eighth Army attack before the X Corps could move west from Wonsan also proved to be correct. General MacArthur officially acknowledged this fact by issuing on 17 October a new United Nations Command Operations Order which drew a boundary between Eighth Army and X Corps. This boundary, starting at the 39th Parallel, followed generally the line of the Taebaek Mountains that extended through the eastern part of Korea up to the Yalu River. ===X Corps plans amphibious assault into northeast Korea=== On 1 October, X Corps commander General Edward Almond and Admiral Arthur Dewey Struble received preliminary instructions from Far East Command for the projected landing at Wonsan. Joint Task Force 7 had been re-established to land the X Corps at Wonsan, and Admiral Struble had been named to command it. He received from Admiral Joy the mission of JTF 7. This was (1) to maintain a naval blockade of the east coast of Korea south from Ch'ongjin; (2) to load and transport X Corps to the Wonsan area and provide cover and support en route; (3) to conduct pre-D-day naval operations as required; (4) on D-day to seize by amphibious assault, occupy, and defend a beachhead in the Wonsan area; (5) to provide naval gunfire, air, and initial logistic support to X Corps in the Wonsan area. On 2 October General MacArthur formalized in his United Nations Operation Order 2 instructions for UN military operations north of the 38th Parallel, and set forth therein the plan of movement and the mission of X Corps. The 1st Marine Division and X Corps headquarters were to load at Inchon while the US 7th Infantry Division and most of the X Corps troops moved to Pusan for loading. The problem of outloading X Corps at Inchon in adverse tidal conditions with the limited amount of amphibious craft available, concurrently with the expected partial use of the port by Eighth Army, was so complicated and difficult that MacArthur decided that part of the force would have to outload at Pusan if the entire Corps was to be loaded within two weeks. The selection of Wonsan as the site of the projected X Corps landing in northeast Korea had been based on a number of factors. Situated at the southwest side of a large bay which bulges inland from the Japan Sea, Wonsan is the principal port on the east coast of Korea; it is the eastern terminus of the easiest route across North Korea; and it is a road and rail communications center. In 1950 when the war started the city had a population of approximately 150,000. The Japanese had developed Wonsan as a naval base, and the North Koreans had continued to use it for the same purpose. It was the principal port of entry for Soviet supplies and military equipment received by sea from the Vladivostok area, and it was a key point on the rail line running southwest into Korea from the Soviet Vladivostok base. It was the petroleum refining capital of Korea. From Wonsan a military force could move inland and west across the peninsula to Pyongyang, or north to the Hamhung-Hungnam area, away, the most important industrial area of all Korea. On 30 September General Smith, commander of the 1st Marine Division, was first informed of the projected X Corps landing at Wonsan. The next day he was requested to submit loading plans by 3 October with a proposed D-day at Wonsan of 15 October. Since ships for the lift had not yet been designated it was impossible to meet these dates. On 7 October, Admiral Doyle, in command of the Attack Force, recommended 20 October as the earliest D-day which the amphibious assault forces could meet. Admirals Struble and Joy concurred and forwarded this recommendation to General MacArthur. He accepted it as a tentative D-day but indicated that every effort should be made to achieve an earlier one. Two days later Admiral Struble published his operation plan outlining the task force organization. On 10 October General MacArthur ordered UN Operations Plan 2 put into effect, thereby canceling all other tentative plans. General MacArthur's Operation Plan 9-50 of 29 September assigned priority of outloading at Inchon to the 1st Marine Division, the amphibious assault element of X Corps. ====1st Marine Division embarkation at Inchon==== On 3 October, X Corps ordered the Marine division to initiate movement to an assembly area in Inchon. On 4 October, General Almond issued a Corps order for the projected operations at Wonsan. The 1st Marine Division had the mission of seizing a Corps base of operations while the 7th Infantry Division was to start an attack west to join with Eighth Army in front of Pyongyang. By 6 October the 1st, 5th, and 11th Marines had virtually completed their movement to Inchon; the next day the 7th Marines began its movement from Uijeongbu to the Inchon assembly area. As it assembled at Inchon to re-embark on amphibious shipping, the 1st Marine Division numbered 23,591 men, with 40 US Army troops and 4,516 Korean Marines attached, for a total of 28,147. At noon on 6 October the 3rd Logistical Command assumed responsibility for all unloading at Inchon. During the day X Corps requested it to halt all unloading activities not directly concerned with the Corps, because otherwise X Corps outloading would be delayed for an estimated six to twenty days. X Corps reverted to Far East Command Reserve at noon on 7 October when Eighth Army assumed responsibility for the Inchon-Seoul area. At Inchon the tides and the great mud banks at low tide made the outloading exceedingly difficult and required carefully co-ordinated schedules in moving troops and supplies. There were only seven berths where Landing Ship, Tank (LSTs) or landing craft could beach at Inchon and these could be used only at high tide. Moreover, there was no adequate staging area. There was only one small pier from which vehicles could be loaded into an LCM, and then only at high tide. Vehicles were loaded on the top decks of LST's and ferried out to the ships in the harbor, and there lifted by crane from the LSTs to the Attack transports and Amphibious cargo ships. The tidal basin was used to outload all bulk cargo for ferrying to the ships in the harbor. This unexpectedly developed into a major and difficult task. The 1st Marine Division had been informed that the 1st Logistical Command would bottom load all the shipping dispatched to Inchon to outload the division with 10 days' level of supply, but this was not done, and it resulted in the necessity of unloading from ships in the harbor and reloading on others, and also of reloading on X Corps shipping considerable supplies from the dumps ashore that otherwise could have been left for Eighth Army. From Japan by air came 32,000 assault rations and 100,000 C rations to Kimpo Airfield, and from there they were taken to the port for outloading. Troops began loading at Inch'on on the 9th. The 1st and 3rd Battalions, 1st Marines, went aboard their LSTs on 10 October, and were in these cramped quarters for sixteen days before they again got ashore. On 11 October the X Corps command post closed ashore and opened aboard the . Bulk loading of cargo began on 8 October and continued to 16 October when all X Corps loading at Inchon was completed. The ships of Amphibious Group One and the LSTs sailed from Inchon late in the afternoon of 16 October. At 08:00 on the 17th, the main body of the Attack Force with the 1st Marine Division aboard departed Inchon, moved into the Yellow Sea, and headed south to round the tip of Korea. From Inchon it was to Wonsan by the shortest sea route. After arriving off the objective area, the flotilla carrying the 1st Marine Division steamed slowly back and forth from 19 to 25 October in the Sea of Japan just outside the Wonsan channel. The restless Marines called it \\"Operation Yo-yo.\\" ====7th Infantry Division movement to Pusan and embarkation==== While the 1st Marine Division was loading at Inchon, the 7th Infantry Division was assembling at Pusan to outload there for the X Corps amphibious movement to northeast Korea. On 30 September the division had been relieved of its responsibilities in the Seoul area and its units began to shift south and southeast to the Suwon and Ich'on areas preparatory to the long overland move to Pusan. Ten LSTs were reserved at Inchon for the division's tanks and heavy equipment. On 4 October Eighth Army indicated the route it wanted the 7th Division to take through its zone, specifying the road through Ch'ungju, Hamch'ang, Kumch'on, Taegu and Kyongju to Pusan, a road distance of from Ich'on. At Taegu the troops were to load on trains for the final part of the journey, whereupon the trucks would return to Suwon and Ich'on for others. The 3rd Battalion, 31st Infantry Regiment, led the 7th Division movement, passing the initial point at Ich'on at 03:50 on 5 October, with the rest of the regiment following. The command group of the 32nd Infantry Regiment led the movement of that regiment through Ich'on four hours later. The 17th Regiment remained at Ich'on, holding its blocking position there until relieved on 8 October, and it then began the motor movement to Pusan. Both the 31st and 32d Regiments arrived at Pusan on 7 October. On 8 October the 7th Division command post closed at Anyang-ni and opened at Pusan, although most of the headquarters was still on the road. The movement to Pusan was not without incident. On two occasions KPA forces ambushed convoys in the mountains near Mun'gyong. The first ambush caught the head of the 2nd Battalion, 31st Infantry, at 02:00, 6 October, and inflicted nine casualties; the second ambush at 02:30, 9 October, caught the division headquarters convoy in the pass northwest of Mun'gyong. KPA machine gun fire killed six men and destroyed several vehicles. Elements of the 1st Battalion, 17th Infantry Regiment, succeeded in clearing the pass area that afternoon. This battalion thereafter patrolled the pass above Mun'gyong until it was relieved on 11 October by the 27th Infantry Regiment of the 25th Division. The division artillery was the last major unit to leave Ich'on at 17:00 on 10 October. It and the 1st Battalion, 17th Infantry, arrived at Pusan on 12 October to complete the division movement to the port. About 450 division troops had been airlifted on 11 October from Kimpo Airfield to Pusan. In addition to the 7th Division, the X Corps Medical, Engineer, Ordnance, Transportation, Quartermaster, Chemical, and Signal units moved overland to Pusan for outloading. Altogether, in seven days, approximately 1,460 tons of supplies and equipment and 13,422 troops had moved overland in division vehicles and those of the 52nd Truck Battalion. The loading of the 7th Division vehicles and equipment at Pusan began on 14 October and that of the men two days later. The division was completely loaded on 17 October, the deadline set by X Corps nine days earlier. The loading of Corps troops at Pusan began on 19 October. In its order of 8 October, X Corps had required the 2nd Logistical Command to furnish 15 days' supply of all classes for the 25,000 troops outloading at Pusan, 10 days of supplies for the troops outloading at Inchon, and, for the entire Corps, 15 days' resupply to arrive in the Wonsan area on D-day plus 8 (28 October). Providing the 15 days of supply depleted depot stocks in that area, particularly of winter clothing, operational rations, POL, and post exchange comfort items. This resulted in subsequent logistical difficulties for Eighth Army. Much of the 15 days' resupply for X Corps had to be requisitioned on the Japan Logistical Command. The difficult logistical and outloading problem given the 2nd Logistical Command on such short notice was worked out successfully only by the constant mutual effort and co-operation of the staffs of the logistical command and of the 7th Infantry Division. The outloading was completed in time. It was an outstanding performance. On 16 October the 7th Division advance command post opened aboard the . But because mine fields in Wonsan Harbor now delayed sailing of the convoys for nearly two weeks, the hectic work at the port to meet the loading deadline was largely in vain. ===Eighth Army deployment=== Based on General MacArthur's UN Command Operations Order 2, dated 2 October, Eighth Army on 3 October issued an operations order to implement its part in the plan for the attack into North Korea. The army order called for US I Corps to seize a line west of the Imjin River with not less than a division, and to concentrate the Corps in an assembly area there as rapidly as IX Corps could relieve it. I Corps was then to conduct operations northward on army orders, making the main effort with the 1st Cavalry Division leading the attack. The 24th Infantry Division and the ROK 1st Infantry Division were to protect the Corps' flanks and form a reserve. In addition to relieving the I Corps in its zone, IX Corps was to protect the line of communications, Seoul-Suwon-Taejon- Taegu-Pusan and, together with Korean National Police, destroy the remaining KPA forces in South Korea. The ROK Army was directed to move its II Corps, consisting of the 6th, 7th, and 8th Infantry Divisions, to the area between Ch'unch'on and Uijongbu in central Korea and its I Corps, composed of the Capital and 3rd Infantry Divisions, to the area between Yongp'o and Chumunjin- up on the east coast, all prepared to attack northward. The ROK Army was also to provide a new division (the 11th) by 5 October to help IX Corps in the rear areas of South Korea. Pursuant to orders, on 5 October the 1st Cavalry Division advanced north of Seoul for the purpose of securing the I Corps' assembly area near the 38th Parallel. Led by I Company, the 5th Cavalry Regiment in the evening crossed to the north side of the Imjin River at Munsan-ni. At noon on the 7th, the 16th Reconnaissance Company entered Kaesong, and that evening elements of the 1st Battalion, 8th Cavalry Regiment, arrived there. By the evening of 8 October the 7th and 8th Cavalry Regiments of the 1st Cavalry Division had secured the I Corps assembly area in the vicinity of Kaesong. Some of the troops were within small arms range of the 38th Parallel. Behind the 1st Cavalry Division, the 24th Infantry Division concentrated in the Seoul area. At this point a new military organization appeared in Korea, and it also concentrated near Seoul. The 3rd Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment, commanded by Lt. Col. Charles H. Green, arrived at Pusan on 28 September. It joined the British 27th Brigade at Kumch'on on 3 October, which was then renamed the 27th British Commonwealth Brigade. Two days later the bulk of the brigade moved by air to Kimpo Airfield as part of the I Corps concentration near the 38th Parallel. With its I Corps concentrated to the north of Seoul, Eighth Army took over control of the Inchon-Seoul area from X Corps at 12:00, 7 October. The command posts of both Eighth Army and the ROK Army moved from Taegu and opened in Seoul on 12 October. Earlier, on 4 October, the Far East Air Forces (FEAF) and the Fifth Air Force, acting on a directive of 8 July, had assumed control of the Marine squadrons at Kimpo. This was highly displeasing to X Corps, and particularly so to the Marines. But the change in control actually made little difference in air operations since FEAF directed that the 1st Marine Air Wing continue to support X Corps. The Fifth Air Force headquarters moved to Seoul on 15 October. As a result of the September victories, the Japan-based fighters and fighter-bombers of the Fifth Air Force moved to Korean bases. This permitted an increase in their armament load, more time over target and combat area, and lengthened flight ranges into North Korea. ==Offensive== ===ROK I Corps captures Wonsan and Hungnam (30 September – 17 October)=== Regardless of whether the UN forces did or did not cross the 38th Parallel, there was always the strong probability that the ROK troops would. Syngman Rhee had often stated his intention of halting the ROK only at the Yalu. Speaking at a mass meeting at Pusan on 19 September he said, \\"We have to advance as far as the Manchurian border until not a single enemy soldier is left in our country.\\" He said that he did not expect the UN forces to stop at the 38th Parallel, but if they did, he continued, \\"we will not allow ourselves to stop.\\" A message dropped by a Korean Military Advisory Group (KMAG) G-3 officer from a light plane at Samch'ok and delivered to Colonel Emmerich at Kangnung on the afternoon of 29 September ordered the ROK 3rd Division to cross the 38th Parallel and proceed to Wonsan as soon as possible. Advanced patrols of the ROK 3rd Division crossed the parallel on 30 September. The next day just before noon two rifle companies crossed the border and came under fire from KPA troops in old fixed positions north of the Parallel. On 2 October the ROK 3rd and Capital Divisions established their command posts in Yangyang, north of the parallel. Although General MacArthur made the first official public announcement of forces under UN command crossing the 38th Parallel on 3 October, the American press had reported the incident the day before. Anticipating that ROK forces would cross the Parallel, newspaper correspondents flew to Kangnung, just south of the border on the east coast, to get the news. Now began a remarkable phase of the pursuit. The ROK 3rd Division traveled northward night and day, on foot and by vehicle, out of communication most of the time with higher headquarters, without flank protection to the west, and bypassing many KPA groups which often attacked their supply points in the rear. There were some costly firefights on the road north. The KPA 5th Division with about 2,400 survivors, retreating as best it could ahead of the ROK's, kept the pursuing advanced elements under mortar and 76-mm. antitank fire. The road was heavily mined and lead vehicles had many casualties. From fortified positions, including connecting trenches, caves, and dug-in gun positions, the KPA tried to stop or slow the ROK advance, however the 3rd Division averaged about a day. The Capital Division followed the 3rd, and at intervals sent some of its units inland into the Diamond Mountains, the lofty Kumgang-san, which crowded close upon the coastline. In central Korea, troops of the ROK II Corps crossed into North Korea later than did the troops of the I Corps on the coast. On 6 October the ROK 6th Division crossed the parallel from the vicinity of Ch'unch'on and advanced on Hwach'on. For three days it fought two regiments of the KPA 9th Division which stubbornly defended that town. Late on the afternoon of 8 October, the division entered Hwach'on, driving two KPA battalions northwest. The 8th Division crossed the 38th Parallel on 7 October. On its right, the 7th Division crossed a day or two later. Both divisions headed for the Iron Triangle. ROK troops arrived at the Iron Triangle on 10 October. There in the Ch'orwon area a large force of KPA attacked the ROK 16th Regiment during the day but was repulsed and forced to withdraw. Elements of the 8th Division then entered Ch'orwon. The Iron Triangle was an area of relatively flat terrain, shaped like an equilateral triangle, in the mountains of east central North Korea. It is situated above the 38th Parallel, halfway across the peninsula, and northeast of Seoul. It is bounded at its three corners by the towns of Ch'orwon at its western base, Kumhwa-eup at its eastern base, and P'yonggang at its northern apex. The area was an important North Korean rail and road communication center, linking east and west coastal areas with each other, and in turn connecting them with the communication net leading south through central South Korea. On 11 October the ROK 8th Division and the 7th Regiment of the 6th Division converged on P'yonggang. On 13 October the 7th Division arrived there by way of Kumhwa. All the ROK divisions, except the 1st, which was part of the US I Corps and accordingly under direct US command, were across the 38th Parallel before any of the American divisions crossed. On 9 October, the ROK 3rd and Capital Divisions were at the south edge of Wonsan, up the coast above the 38th Parallel. That day the Capital Division on the Wonsan-Iron Triangle road south of the city captured 6 tanks, 4 artillery pieces, 10 82-mm mortars, 1 120-mm mortar, 30 heavy machine guns, 500 submachine guns, 5,000 Soviet rifles, 1 boxcar of medical supplies, and another of miscellaneous supplies. The bulk of the ROK 3rd Division arrived in front of Wonsan by the coastal road. The KPA 24th Mechanized Artillery Brigade, the 945th Regiment (naval amphibious troops) and other units subordinate to the naval headquarters at Wonsan defended the city. KPA artillery pieces emplaced behind dikes just south of it delivered direct fire against the ROK forces. Troops of both the ROK 3rd and Capital Divisions entered Wonsan on 10 October, with the 3rd Division on the coastal road making the greater effort. About long and of irregular, narrow width, the city is shaped by the -high hills that rise abruptly from the narrow coastal strip. In order to settle rival claims as to which division entered the city first, the Corps commander, Brig. Gen. Kim Baik Yil decreed that both divisions got there simultaneously at 06:00 and that both secured it at 10:00. But the city was not secured then. Colonel Emmerich, KMAG senior adviser with the 3rd Division, entered the city with the front line troops of the ROK 23rd Regiment just after noon. The KPA had maintained a heavy artillery fire from the city until almost noon. Then, after withdrawing most of their guns from Wonsan, they fired into the city all afternoon from its northwest sector and the hills behind it. That afternoon the 3rd Division captured the heavily mined airfield on the peninsula east of the city. At nightfall both ROK divisions were still engaged in street fighting within the city. During the night a KPA armored task force, including about ten 76-mm self-propelled antitank guns, returned to the airfield and did a good job of shooting it up, burning out most of the buildings and hangars. On 11 October, the ROK 3rd Division fought through Wonsan against KPA artillery, mortar, and small arms fire. It secured the city, and by evening had troops one mile north of it. The Capital Division helped clear the city and occupied the airfield. Generals Walker and 5th Air Force commander General Earle E. Partridge flew into Wonsan Airfield on the 11th. Finding it in good condition, General Partridge had twenty-two planes of the Combat Cargo Command fly in 131 tons of supplies for the ROK troops the next day. In the week after the capture of Wonsan the ROK 3rd Division remained in the vicinity, securing the area for the expected landing of X Corps. The Capital Division meanwhile moved on north up the coast, and, against light resistance, secured both Hamhung and its port, Hungnam, on 17 October. During its great success in advancing northward into North Korea the ROK expanded and reorganized. On 8 October it reactivated the 5th Division at Taegu and once again counted eight divisions, the same number that it had when the war began. Simultaneously, the ROK activated the 1st Guerrilla Group of five battalions (1st, 2nd, 3rd, 5th and 6th). Eight days later, on 16 October, it activated the ROK III Corps. This new corps, to which the 5th and 11th Divisions were attached, was to assume responsibility for the ROK zone south of the Seoul-Ch'unch'- on-Inje-Yangyang axis, and destroy remaining KPA troops and guerrillas in that part of Korea. ===Eighth Army crosses the 38th Parallel (7 October)=== On 5 October Eighth Army issued its operations order for the movement across the 38th Parallel, but withheld the date for the attack. On 7 October Eighth Army implemented its order of the 5th by radio messages to US I Corps commander General Frank W. Milburn and to the Chief of Staff, ROK. The attack on Pyongyang was about to begin. Eighth Army expected strong KPA resistance at the 38th Parallel and a stubborn defense of Pyongyang. According to ROK intelligence, the North Koreans had three known lines of defense across the peninsula, each consisting of pillboxes, gun emplacements, trenches, and barbed wire entanglements. The first line was along the 38th Parallel and was about in depth; the second line was about behind the first; the third lay farther back and was based on locally situated critical terrain features. All three lines were oriented to defend against southern approaches. North of the Parallel the UN Command expected to meet newly activated divisions that had been training in North Korea or elements of units that had engaged in the fighting around Seoul. Some intelligence sources indicated there might be as many as six divisions totalling 60,000 men in North Korean training centers. Actually, only the KPA 19th and 27th Divisions defended the Kumch'on- Namch'onjom area north of Kaesong. Both had been brigades activated in the summer and expanded in September to division status. They engaged in combat for the first time when UN forces crossed the Parallel. On the right (west) of these divisions, the 74th Regiment of the 43rd Division defended the Yesong River crossing site west of Kaesong. The 43rd Division, organized in mid- September, had the task of defending the coastal area beyond the Yesong River. Some elements of the KPA 17th Armored Division engaged in action just north of the Parallel in the zone of the ROK 1st Division, east of the 1st Cavalry Division. Ready for the attack, the 1st Cavalry Division was deployed in three regimental combat teams just below the Parallel in the vicinity of Kaesong. In the center, Colonel Palmer's 8th Cavalry Regiment was to attack frontally along the main highway axis from Kaesong to Kumch'on; on his right, Colonel Crombez' 5th Cavalry Regiment was to swing eastward, then west, in a circular flanking movement designed to envelop KPA forces south of Kumch'on, north of the Parallel. Meanwhile, on the division left, Colonel Harris' 7th Cavalry Regiment faced the task of crossing the Yesong River to get on the road running north from Paekch'on to the little town of Hanp'o-ri, north of Kumch'on, where the main Pyongyang road crossed the Yesong River. At Hanp'o-ri the 7th Cavalry was to establish a blocking position to trap the large KPA forces that Division commander General Hobart R. Gay expected the 8th and 5th Cavalry Regiments to be driving northward. These were the maneuvers involved in the action of the Kumch'on Pocket. Because the prospects of forcing a crossing of the Yesong River did not appear very promising with the support available, General Gay and the division staff relied principally on the 8th and 5th Cavalry Regiments for initial success in the attack. The 1st Cavalry Division sent patrols across the Parallel late on the afternoon of the 7th, and others crossed on the night of 8 October. On 9 October, at 09:00 General Gay issued his orders, and the division moved up to the Parallel and started fighting its way northward. ===The Kumch'on Pocket (9–14 October)=== The Kumch'on Pocket, 9–14 October 1950 In the division center along the main highway, the advance was very slow. The highway was heavily mined and the armored spearhead repeatedly came to a halt, waiting for Engineer troops to remove the mines. On 12 October, halfway to Kumch'on, a KPA strongpoint defended with tanks, self-propelled guns, and antiaircraft weapons again stopped the regiment. An air strike by sixteen planes and a 155-mm howitzer barrage failed to dislodge the KPA. In this action, Lt. Col. Robert W. Kane, the 1st Battalion commander, was severely wounded. On the division right the 5th Cavalry Regiment also had difficulty. It reached the Parallel at 19:30 9 October but did not cross until the next morning. In its initial attack it captured the hills flanking and dominating the road on both sides just above the Parallel. northeast of Kaesong a KPA force held a long ridge with several knobs (Hills 179, 175, 174) dominating a pass. There it stopped the 1st Battalion. The next day, 12 October, the 2nd Battalion joined in the battle. The 5th Cavalry drove the KPA from the ridge during the afternoon. In the fighting at Hill 174, 1st Lt. Samuel S. Coursen, a platoon leader in C Company, went to the aid of a soldier who had entered an enemy emplacement mistakenly thinking it was empty. The soldier escaped with a wound, but Coursen was later found dead there together with seven KPA soldiers whom he had killed in a desperate hand-to-hand struggle. Several of the North Koreans had crushed skulls from rifle butt blows. Coursen was later posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor. On 11 October, the 27th British Commonwealth Brigade, with tanks of B Company, 6th Medium Tank Battalion, in support, had crossed the Imjin River and followed the 5th Cavalry Regiment northeast out of Kaesong. General Gay's plan was for the brigade to move northwest through the mountains for a close-in envelopment of Kumch'on. His aerial observer, hitherto very reliable, wrongly reported that the roads were as shown on the maps and that the plan was feasible. The road taken by the British, little more than a cart track, dead-ended in the mountains. The Middlesex Battalion got lost on this trail, turned back, and tried another. Despite an arduous effort in the mountains, the British troops never got into the fight for Kumch'on. While the British were crossing the Imjin, the ROK 1st Division crossed it at Korangp'o-ri at dawn on the 11th, eastward of the 1st Cavalry Division, and attacked northwest on a road that converged with the one taken by the 5th Cavalry Regiment. The 5th Cavalry in the late afternoon of 12 October was engaged in a firefight with the KPA at the objective crossroads when advance elements of the ROK 1st Division arrived there from the southeast. In a conference on the spot Colonel Crombez and General Paik Sun- yup, the ROK division commander, agreed that the 5th Cavalry would have precedence on the road until Crombez' troops turned west, northward on a lateral road leading into Kumch'on. The ROK 1st Division, following behind the 5th Cavalry, would then continue its attack north to Sibyon-ni where it would veer northwest toward Pyongyang. Tanks of C Company, 6th Medium Tank Battalion, supported the ROK 1st Division. Of the three regimental attack forces, the 7th Cavalry Regiment on the division left flank had the most difficult assignment, and in fact General Gay and his staff expected it to accomplish little. The regiment had to cross the wide Yesong River against defending KPA forces before it could turn north as the lefthand column in the Kumch'on Pocket maneuver. Since all of I Corps' bridging troops and equipment were committed to establishing bridges across the Imjin River at Munsan-ni to support the main effort northward, river crossing support could not be supplied for the 7th Cavalry Regiment at the Yesong River. On 8 October, the 7th Cavalry Regiment received orders to move up to the Yesong River, search for crossing sites, and clear KPA troops from the area southwest of Kaesong. The Intelligence & Reconnaissance (I&R;) Platoon found that the high, -long combination highway and rail bridge over the river on the Kaesong-Paekch'on route was standing, although damaged. It was so weakened, however, that it could support only foot traffic. The I&R; Platoon received small arms, automatic, and mortar fire from the KPA on the far side of the river. Colonel Clainos, commander of the 1st Battalion, also personally reconnoitered the area with a platoon of A Company on the afternoon of the 8th and received fire from the west bank of the stream. The I&R; Platoon leader told him that KPA forces held the west side of the river from the southern tip of the peninsula to a point northeast of the Yesong River bridge. Colonel Harris, the regimental commander, upon receiving the I&R; Platoon report that the bridge was usable for foot troops, ordered the platoon to prevent further destruction of the bridge. He then called upon the 1st Battalion to seize the bridge and crossing area. A full report of the situation was given to the 1st Cavalry Division with the recommendation that the 7th Cavalry Regiment seize this unexpected opportunity for a quick crossing of the river. General Gay feared that the North Koreans had set a trap in leaving the bridge usable for foot troops, and that KPA zeroed-in mortar and artillery fire and automatic weapons would decimate any troops caught on it. The division staff said also that a regimental attack west of the Yesong River northward could not be supported logistically. The untiring efforts of Colonel Harris and his S-3, Captain Webel, however, succeeded in winning from General Gay authority to attempt the crossing on the 9th. On the afternoon of 9 October, the 7th Cavalry Regiment delivered three hours of preparatory artillery fire against KPA positions on the west bank of the river. At 15:00, Colonel Clainos ordered a platoon of C Company to cross the bridge under cover of the barrage. In crossing the bridge and seizing the immediate approaches on the far side, the platoon suffered a few casualties from small arms fire. Following this platoon, B Company, 8th Engineer Combat Battalion, went on the bridge and spent all night under fire repairing holes in the roadway. After the first troops reached the far side, Clainos sent the rest of C Company across and it occupied the hill on the right of the bridge. Next to cross was B Company, which seized the hill just south of the bridge. The artillery and mortar barrage had been unable to silence KPA mortars, and these fired heavy concentrations on the bridge during the 1st Battalion crossing, which took several hours to complete. The overhead steel girders of the bridge gave excellent protection from fire and prevented many casualties. When the supporting artillery barrage had to be lifted from the immediate environs of the bridge, once the 1st Battalion troops crossed to that side, casualties began to increase rapidly from KPA fire. In this crossing attack, the 1st Battalion had 78 casualties; C Company alone had 7 killed and 36 wounded. After dark, the KPA launched a counterattack against the 1st Battalion, and Colonel Harris ordered Lt. Col. Gilmon A. Huff to hasten his crossing with the 2nd Battalion. Just before midnight Huff's battalion started infiltrating across the bridge which was still under some mortar and small arms fire. On the other side, Huff assembled his battalion on the south flank of the 1st Battalion, approximately west of the bridge. He then attacked west along the Paekch'on road in a column of companies with G Company leading. This attack progressed only a short distance when a heavy KPA counterattack from the south struck the flank of G Company. The counterattack threw the 2nd Battalion into momentary confusion. In the beginning of the fight, small arms fire hit Huff in the shoulder, but he remained with his battalion throughout the night battle. The largest weapons the battalion had at hand were 57-mm recoilless rifles and 60-mm mortars. Huff's unit eventually seized the high ground southeast of the bridge and the road. By dawn, it was clear that the battle was all but over and that the 2nd Battalion would be able to move forward. Huff then turned over command of the battalion to the executive officer who led it in a continuation of the attack westward. The battalion seized Paekch'on and the high ground north of the town in the afternoon. The next morning, 11 October, the 3rd Battalion, 7th Cavalry, crossed the Yesong River and headed north. Thus, by that morning all three regiments of the 1st Cavalry Division had crossed the 38th Parallel and were driving into North Korea. On the morning of 12 October, the 3rd Battalion, 7th Cavalry, seized its objective—the railroad and highway bridges at Hanp'o-ri north of Kumch'on, and the road juncture there. This closed the western escape route of an estimated 1,000 KPA troops in Kumch'on. Fighter-bombers mistakenly strafed and rocketed the 3d Battalion at Hanp'o-ri, wounding several men. That evening the 2nd Battalion joined the 3rd Battalion at Hanp'o-ri. During the night at the 3rd Battalion roadblock, the pressure from the 8th and 5th Cavalry Regiments on the North Koreans was made evident. A platoon of L Company ambushed 11 KPA trucks running with their lights on, destroying 4 trucks loaded with ammunition, capturing 6 others, killed about 50 KPA soldiers and capturing an equal number. Among the latter was a mortally wounded regimental commander who had in his possession a document indicating that the KPA 19th and 27th divisions intended to break out of Kumch'on the night of 14 October. Before he died the officer said part of the KPA force had been ordered to withdraw to Namch'onjom, a fortified area north of Kumch'on. The drive of the 7th Cavalry Regiment northward to Hanp'o-ri after crossing the Yesong River could not have taken place without logistical supply. In the discussions before the 7th Cavalry attack at the Yesong River bridge, the 1st Cavalry Division supply officer advised that he could not provide the gasoline, rations, and ammunition for the drive north from Paekch'on even if the river crossing attempt was successful. Colonel Harris and Captain Webel decided to try to obtain the needed logistical support from the 3rd Logistical Command at Inchon by amphibious transport through the Yellow Sea and up the Yesong River. 500 tons of supplies were loaded on thirteen Landing craft and they arrived at the 7th Cavalry crossing site at the Yesong River bridge late in the afternoon of the 10th. Engineer troops from I Corps on the 12th constructed a ponton ferry at the bridge site and it transported the tanks of C Company, 70th Tank Battalion, across the river for support of the regiment. 13 October promised to be a critical day in the efforts of the 1st Cavalry Division to close the Kumch'on Pocket. With the 7th Cavalry blocking the exit road from Kumch'on, the decisive action now rested with the 8th and 5th Cavalry Regiments which were trying to compress the pocket from the south and the east. After it turned west from the Sibyon-ni road the 5th Cavalry encountered an almost continuous minefield in its approach to Kumch'on, and it also had to fight and disperse a KPA force estimated to number 300 soldiers, from the town. Overcoming these difficulties, the regiment pressed ahead and by the evening of the 13th it was approaching Kumch'on. Strong opposition confronted the 8th Cavalry Regiment on the main highway where the KPA apparently had concentrated most of their available forces and weapons. There, on the morning of the 13th, an artillery preparation employing proximity fuze air bursts blanketed the North Korean positions. Because of the closeness of the American troops to the enemy, a planned B-26 bomber strike was canceled, but a new flight of fighter planes appeared over the KPA positions every thirty minutes. The KPA resisted stubbornly with tanks, artillery, mortars, small arms fire and counterattacks. In one of the counterattacks, KPA tanks rumbled out of the early morning mist to strike an outpost of B Company, 70th Tank Battalion. Sgt. Marshall D. Brewery said his tank gunner first fired on the lead tank at a range of yards. A second round hit it at a range of . Still the T-34 came on and rammed into the American tank. Brewery's driver put his tank in reverse, jerked loose, and backed away. At a few yards range the gunner fired a third round into the tank which now had a split gun muzzle and was burning. Amazingly, the tank rumbled forward and rammed Brewery's tank a second time. The fourth round finally knocked out this stubborn tank. In the day's series of attacks and counterattacks the 8th Cavalry and supporting arms destroyed eight KPA tanks; B Company, 70th Tank Battalion, accounted for seven of them without loss to itself. While the KPA south of Kumch'on fought desperately and successfully to prevent the 8th Cavalry from closing in on the town, a large KPA column of trucks and carts with an estimated 1,000 soldiers moved northward out of it on the road toward Namch'onjom. At the Hanp'o-ri bridge it ran into the 7th Cavalry roadblock. In the ensuing action the 7th Cavalry, aided by airstrikes, killed an estimated 500 and captured 201 of this force. The other KPA troops escaped into the hills northeast of the town. At the same time, elements of the KPA 43rd Division cut off below Paekch'on were moving around that town and fleeing north. One such group in company strength occupied old KPA defensive positions just north of the 38th Parallel the night of 12–13 October. The following day it ambushed the tail end of the 1st Battalion, 7th Cavalry, column moving north from Paekch'on. Part of A Battery, 77th Field Artillery Battalion, and B Company, 8th Engineer Combat Battalion were in the ambushed column. A soldier who escaped raced back into Paekch'on to the 3rd Battalion, 21st Infantry Regiment, command post. Colonel Stephens, the regimental commander, happened to be there. Upon hearing what had happened, he directed Lt. Col. John A. McConnell, Commanding Officer, 3rd Battalion, to send a company to the scene. Colonel McConnell thereupon directed I Company, 21st Infantry, which was on a blocking mission south of the ambush site, to go there. On arrival it engaged and dispersed the KPA force with mortar and small arms fire, and captured 36 North Koreans. In this ambush the North Koreans killed 29 American and 8 South Korean soldiers and wounded 30 Americans and 4 South Koreans. They also destroyed 4 and damaged 14 vehicles. In this episode, as in so many others like it, those caught in the roadblock apparently made little effort to defend themselves. In another ambush on the road that night enemy troops captured the 2nd Battalion, 7th Cavalry, supply officer and 11 men; subsequently, however, the officer and 5 men escaped. At midnight of the 13th, the 2nd Battalion, 5th Cavalry Regiment, resumed its attack on Kumch'on from the east. After dispersing a KPA force near the town, the battalion then entered and seized the northern part of it. The 3rd Battalion following behind seized the southern part. At 08:30, 14 October, Colonel Crombez and the regimental command group arrived in Kumch'on. Crombez ordered the 2nd Battalion to turn north toward the 7th Cavalry at Hanp'o-ri and the 3rd Battalion to turn south to meet the 8th Cavalry on the Kaesong road. The 1st Battalion remained behind to secure the town. Advancing northwest, the 2nd Battalion joined elements of the 7th Cavalry above Hanp'o-ri at noon. A KPA force, estimated to number 2,400 men, which had been attacking the 7th Cavalry roadblock position at Hanp'o-ri, escaped into the hills when the 2nd Battalion approached from the south. Meanwhile, attacking south from Kumch'on, the 3rd Battalion neared a special task force of the 8th Cavalry Regiment which had attacked north during the morning and already had lost two tanks to KPA action. The two columns, the 3rd Battalion, 5th Cavalry, and the special 8th Cavalry task force met just after noon about south of Kumch'on. Even though the 1st Cavalry Division envelopment and capture of Kumch'on had been carried out in five days, a large part of the KPA force in the Kumch on Pocket escaped, mostly to the north and northwest. The day Kumch'on fell to the 1st Cavalry Division, 14 October, the North Korean Premier and Commander in Chief, Kim Il Sung, issued an order to all troops of the KPA explaining the reasons for the army's defeat and outlining harsh measures for future army discipline. Alluding to the recent reverses, Kim Il Sung said, \\"Some of our officers have been cast into utter confusion by the new situation and have thrown away their weapons and left their positions without orders.\\" He commanded; \\"Do not retreat one step farther. Now we have no space in which to fall back.\\" He directed that agitators and deserters be executed on the spot, irrespective of their positions in the Army. To carry out this order, he directed that division and unit commanders organize, by the following day, a special group, which he termed the \\"Supervising Army,\\" its men to be recruited from those who had distinguished themselves in battle. By the close of 14 October, with US I Corps troops through the principal prepared KPA positions between the 38th Parallel and Pyongyang, KPA front lines as such had ceased to exist. The KPA were in a state of utter confusion. In these auspicious circumstances, President Truman on 15 October met General MacArthur on Wake Island. A few days earlier, in announcing his intention to make the trip, President Truman had said he would discuss with General MacArthur \\"the final phase of U.N. action in Korea.\\" ===Demining Wonsan Harbour (10-25 October)=== Following the Inchon landing, evidence began to mount that the North Koreans were mining the coastal waters of North Korea. Three US Navy ships, the , Alansfield and , struck mines and suffered heavy damage. Although intelligence sources indicated mines were being laid in coastal waters, little was known about the location and extent of these mine fields. North Korean interests certainly dictated, however, that the sea approaches to Wonsan should be mined. In a series of conferences from 2 to 4 October, Admiral Struble and his staff decided to form the Advance Force JTF 7, which would proceed to the objective area and begin minesweeping at the earliest possible date. All minesweepers available were to be concentrated for the task. The group comprised 21 vessels, including 10 American and 8 Japanese minesweepers, and 1 Republic of Korea Navy vessel used as a minesweeper. Minesweeping operations at Wonsan began on 10 October. A search by helicopter over the harbor channel showed it to be heavily mined inside the 30-fathom curve. The plan to sweep this channel was cancelled and another substituted—to sweep from the 100-fathom curve down the Russian Hydropac Channel passing between Yodo and Hwangt'o-do Islands. By 12 October this channel had been swept a distance of from the 100-fathom curve. remained to the inner harbor. At this point the novel idea was advanced of exploding mines along a narrow passageway by aerial bombing which would permit the lead sweeps to pass. On 12 October thirty-nine planes from the carriers and flew down the Russian channel dropping 1,000-pound bombs. Three minesweepers, , and , then entered the bombed channel to resume minesweeping. Northwest of Yodo Island Pirate struck a mine at 12:09; Pledge hit one six minutes later. Both vessels sank. As Incredible, third in line, maneuvered into safe water, KPA shore batteries opened fire. Twelve men went down with the two ships and one died later from wounds. At least 33 others were wounded and injured in varying degrees. The menace of shore batteries was removed on 17 October when ROK I Corps, which had already captured Wonsan, gained control of the peninsulas and islands commanding the harbor approaches, however, casualties from mines continued. On 18 October two ROK Navy vessels struck mines in the Wonsan area; one was disabled at the entrance to the harbor, and the other, a minesweeper, was sunk. The next day a Japanese minesweeper struck a mine and sank. The risk of sending transports with troops to the beaches was still great. The presence of ground mines in the shallow water made necessary a thorough magnetic sweep of the close-in approaches to the landing beaches. Because troops of ROK I Corps were now well past Wonsan, the military situation did not warrant an unnecessary risk in unloading the Marine units. Admiral Struble, therefore, recommended that they not be unloaded on 20 October as planned, but that D-day be deferred until the minesweeping could be completed. Admiral Joy and General MacArthur concurred. A report from the minesweeper group on 23 October indicated that a channel free of mines had been swept to Blue-Yellow Beach, but that sweeping of the beach area itself was being continued. At a conference on board the the next day, Admiral Struble decided that landings could start on the 25th; actually they did not begin until the morning of the 26th. The conference on the 24th also decided that the minesweepers should clear the Wonsan inner harbor. Then they were to sweep the approaches to Hungnam to clear that port. General Almond had urged this so that logistical support could be centered there for the X Corps operations in northeast Korea. Not until 4 November did the minesweepers complete their work in the Wonsan inner harbor. Ships of the task force then stood into the harbor and pulled up alongside the dock. The minesweepers then continued to Hungnam where they swept a channel long and wide, as well as an anchorage in the inner harbor. Actually, the minesweepers were busy as long as X Corps was in northeast Korea. Floating mines were common sights at this time off the east coast of Korea in the Wonsan-Hungnam area. One of the worst mine disasters occurred on 16 November, when an Army tug with a crane barge in tow struck a mine off the entrance to Wonsan Harbor and sank, with approximately thirty men lost out of forty. While the minesweeping was progressing offshore, Lt. Col. William J. McCaffrey, Deputy Chief of Staff, X Corps, on 16 October brought the X Corps Advance Command Post to Wonsan by air, flying from Kimpo Airfield. He immediately established communications with ROK I Corps and the commander of the minesweeping operations. McCaffrey's staff set to work at once with ROK I Corps G-2 to learn who had laid the mines in the harbor and to find the warehouses where they had been stored. This was done successfully by ROK I Corps intelligence section. The ROK found a villager who had worked in the mine depot who guided a party to a depot north of Wonsan where the mines had been stored and assembled. He also provided information enabling the investigators to take into custody one of the sampan captains who had helped plant the mines. The information gained from these sources indicated that thirty Russians had been in Wonsan until 4 October assembling the mines and supervising laying the minefields. Working almost entirely at night, from about thirty-two small boats, North Korean crews and their supervisors had laid approximately 3,000 mines. The North Koreans and their helpers had not confined laying mines at Wonsan to the waters in the harbor. The beaches were also heavily planted with land mines. This had been expected, and as soon as ROK I Corps had secured Wonsan it cleared the beaches of mines. On the night of 16 October at the north end of the Wonsan Harbor ROK troops had stacked about 1,000 20-pound box mines they had just lifted from the beaches. A ROK lieutenant and five enlisted men decided to have a private celebration, and, moving off about , the lieutenant fired into the stacked mines. The mines exploded, shattering panes of glass in the provincial capital building away and killing all six ROK soldiers. On 20 October General Almond flew from the USS Missouri by helicopter to Wonsan Airfield. At noon the X Corps command post was officially opened in Wonsan. ===Logistical problems=== The Eighth Army advance into North Korea had begun under great logistical difficulties and was supported only on the narrowest margin. On 10 October, the day after the attack began, General Milburn expressed himself as being disturbed by the logistical situation of I Corps. He felt that at least 3,000 tons of balanced stocks should be in the Kaesong ammunition supply points. But Col. Albert K. Stebbins, Jr., Eighth Army G-4 supply officer, informed him that this could not be accomplished unless all the truck companies were diverted to that task. The unfavorable supply situation largely grew out of the fact that during the first half of October (1–17 October) unloading activities at Inchon for Eighth Army were negligible. Practically all the port capabilities at that time were engaged in mounting out the 1st Marine Division for the Wonsan operation. Levels of some supplies for I Corps were at times reduced to one day, and only selective unloading enabled the supply sections to meet troop requirements. Most combat vehicles, such as tanks, operated in the forward zone without knowing whether they would have enough fuel at hand to continue the attack the next day. Because it could not support any more troops north of the Han River at this time, Eighth Army had been compelled to undertake the movement north of the 38th Parallel with only I Corps, leaving IX Corps below the river. As rapidly as the logistical situation permitted, General Walker intended to move IX Corps into North Korea to help in the drive to the border. On 23 October, General Walker informed IX Corps commander General John B. Coulter that ROK III Corps (5th and 11th Divisions) would relieve IX Corps in its zone as soon as practicable for this purpose, and not later than 10 November. On 19 October the army forward distributing point was at Kaesong. Hence, for most units supplies had to be trucked more than , a most difficult logistical situation even with good roads, and those in Korea were far from that. During this time Eighth Army used about 200 trucks daily to transport food, gasoline, and lubricants to dumps north of Seoul. A pipeline, completed in October, carried aviation gasoline from Inchon to Kimpo Airfield and helped immensely in supplying the planes with fuel. The 3rd Logistical Command at Inchon was assigned to Eighth Army on 7 October with the primary mission of providing it with logistical support in North Korea. Eighth Army in turn attached the 3rd Logistical Command to the 2nd Logistical Command. From Pusan the 2nd Logistical Command continued of necessity to forward by rail and truck supplies for Eighth Army. The solution to Eighth Army's logistical problems rested in the last analysis on the railroads. Airlift and long-distance trucking were emergency measures only; they could not supply the army for an offensive operation several hundreds of miles from its railhead. At the end of September, rail communications for Eighth Army did not extend beyond the old Pusan Perimeter. Yet the army itself was then at the Han River, northward. Because of the resulting logistical strain, the repair of the rail line north of Waegwan was of the greatest importance. The reconstruction of the railroad bridges over the major rivers north of Taegu constituted the greatest single problem. To rebuild these bridges Eighth Army marshalled all available bridging equipment and matériel. Engineer construction troops, aided by great numbers of Korean laborers, worked to the limit of their endurance to restore the rail lines northward. The Koreans assumed responsibility for repairing minor bridges, I Corps most of the highway bridges, and Eighth Army the rail bridges and the largest highway bridges. The first great task was to repair the break in the Waegwan rail bridge over the Naktong. Working above the water, the engineers, after some preliminary work, in 7 days completed the major repairs. Rail traffic crossed the bridge on 5 October. At first all effort was concentrated on opening single track communications over the of rail from the Naktong to the Han River. This was accomplished on 10 October, 17 days after reconstruction work started at the Naktong River bridge. It was not until 11 days later that a shoofly bridge carried rail traffic across the Han into Seoul. But even after trains crossed into Seoul they could proceed only as far as Munsan- ni on the south bank of the Imjin River. This was still below the Eighth Army front at the Ch'ongch'on River in late October. Thus, at that time the railhead was still as many miles south of the Eighth Army front as it had been a month earlier when the front was in the Seoul area and the railhead was at Waegwan. At Munsan-ni the supplies were unloaded, trucked across the Imjin, and reloaded on trains on the north side. Meanwhile, Engineer troops were at work repairing the Imjin River rail bridge. The water span was long, with a length of several thousand feet of earth fill required in its approaches. As a generalization, it may be said that the railhead lagged 200 miles behind the Eighth Army front in October 1950. The daily \\"must\\" trains from Pusan at this time were (1) a train of 9 cars to Taejon for the 25th Division, (2) a ration train of 20 cars (200,000 rations) to Yongdungp'o, (3) 2 ammunition trains of 20 cars each, (4) 1 hospital train, (5) 1 POL train of 30 cars, and (6) 1 train of 20 cars every other day in support of ROK troops based in the Seoul area. Repair of the major highway bridges presented a problem just as pressing as repair of the rail bridges. In some respects, it was an even more immediate problem because, in general, the highway bridges could be repaired more quickly, and they were the first used to keep supplies moving forward to the troops. The span break in the Naktong River highway bridge at Waegwan was closed with pile bents and a triple single-panel Bailey bridge. The first traffic crossed the repaired bridge on 30 September. To provide a vehicular bridge across the Han River at Seoul quickly, the FEAF Combat Cargo Command, using seventy C-119 flights, flew in a pontoon bridge from Japan. This 50-ton floating bridge was long. On 30 September, 3,034 vehicles crossed it, and thereafter traffic passed over it day and night. A second bridge was completed across the Han on 7 October. The next afternoon two-way traffic resumed across the river. At every turn in the operations in North Korea during October, Eighth Army's effort was limited by an adverse logistical situation. Eighth Army's troops had almost reached Pyongyang before it could get any supplies through the port of Inchon, where facilities were still devoted exclusively to outloading X Corps. ===Battle of Sariwon (17 October)=== With action in the Kumch'on Pocket ended, in the first phase of Eighth Army's drive into North Korea, the 2nd Battalion, 7th Cavalry, marched from Hanp'ori on Namch'onjom. Air strikes on that town at 07:00, 15 October, preceded the attack. The 2nd Battalion then launched its assault, supported by artillery, against fiercely defending KPA. After hard fighting the 2nd Battalion overcame the KPA and entered Namch'onjom at noon, losing ten men killed and thirty wounded in the battle. KPA prisoners said that strafing attacks on Namch'onjom during the morning had destroyed the 19th Division command post and killed the division chief of staff. Torrential rains now turned the dusty roads into seas of mud, and maneuvers planned to put the 5th Cavalry in front of the retreating enemy came to naught. On 16 October, Colonel Lynch's 3rd Battalion, 7th Cavalry, led the attack out of Namch'onjom, and by noon it had secured Sohung, northwest. The 1st Battalion passed through the town, turned north on a secondary road, and prepared to advance on Hwangju the next day. Colonel Harris and the regimental headquarters arrived at Sohung late in the afternoon. On the right of the 1st Cavalry Division the ROK 1st Division had made spectacular progress. On the 13th it entered Sibyon-ni, a vital crossroads northeast of Kaesong. Two days later it engaged a regiment- sized force of KPA, which was supported by six tanks and artillery, in heavy battle in the vicinity of Miu-dong northeast of Namch'onjom. With his men following the high ground and his tanks on the road, Paik moved ahead. His division fought another battle the next day, 16 October, after which its leading elements entered Suan, southeast of Pyongyang. General Paik said at this time that his tactics were \\"no stop.\\" It began to look as if his division, the infantry afoot and traveling over secondary roads, was going to beat the American motorized columns to Pyongyang. On 15 October General Milburn reflected General Walker's impatience with what Walker thought was a slow advance. Milburn ordered the 24th Division to move into attack position on the left (west) of the 1st Cavalry Division and to seize Sariwon from the south, and then attack north toward Pyongyang. On the same day General Gay ordered the 27th British Commonwealth Brigade to assemble behind the 7th Cavalry Regiment and be prepared to pass through it and seize Sariwon. Thus the stage was set for a continuation of the I Corps drive for Pyongyang. General Gay has said of that period, \\"The situation was tense, everybody was tired and nervous.\\" The 21st Infantry Regiment, 24th Division met just enough opposition as it moved from Paekch'on toward Haeju to prevent the infantry from mounting the trucks and rolling along rapidly as a motorized column. Its tank-infantry teams on 17 October overcame 300 KPA defending Haeju and secured the town that afternoon. The 19th Infantry Regiment, 24th Division, meanwhile, trailed the 5th Cavalry Regiment. Both of them turned westward off the main highway at Namch'onjom. The 19th Infantry was to continue westward beyond Nuch'on-ni and then turn north toward Sariwon. On the 16th a bad traffic jam developed on the road up to Namch'onjom where the 27th British Commonwealth Brigade, the 5th Cavalry and the 19th Regiment were all on the road. For long periods the vehicles moved slowly, bumper to bumper. From Namch'onjom westward, the 19th Infantry, behind the 5th Cavalry Regiment, was powerless to accelerate its pace although Division commander General John H. Church had ordered it to do so. Word came at this time that General Milburn had told Generals Gay and Church that whichever division—the 1st Cavalry or the 24th Infantry reached Sariwon first would thereby win the right to lead the Corps' attack on into Pyongyang. The 24th Division was handicapped in this race for Sariwon, as it had a roundabout, longer route over inferior roads and poorer supply routes. Map of the capture of Pyongyang On 17 October, with the 1st Battalion in the lead, the 7th Cavalry Regiment followed the secondary \\"cow path\\" road north from Sohung in a circuitous route toward Hwangju where it would strike the main Pyongyang highway north of Sariwon. The 27th British Commonwealth Brigade passed through the lines of the 7th Cavalry that morning at Sohung and took up the advance along the main highway toward Sariwon. Sariwon lay some up the highway almost due west from Sohung. At Sariwon the highway and railroad debouched from the mountains, turned north and ran through the coastal plain to Pyongyang, away. Only occasional low hills lay across the road between Sariwon and Pyongyang. It was generally expected that the KPA would make their stand for the defense of Pyongyang, short of the city itself, on the heights before Sariwon. The 27th British Commonwealth Brigade advanced on Sariwon along the main highway capturing the town while the 7th Cavalry Regiment encircled it and moved south. During a day and night of confused engagements, the British/US force killed over 215 and captured more than 3,700 KPA soldiers for minor losses. ===Capture of Pyongyang (17–20 October)=== By the time the UN troops reached Sariwon it was clear that the remaining KPA forces could not attempt a strong defense of Pyongyang without incurring total destruction or capture. The KPA by this time not only had to contend with US I Corps, approaching Pyongyang along the main Seoul axis from the south, but also the enveloping movements of the ROK forces from the southeast and east. Some of these forces, if they continued their rapid advance for a few days more, would almost certainly cut on the north the highways and exits from the city. Pyongyang would then be surrounded and any forces retained in and around the city for its defense would face either destruction or surrender. The 1st Cavalry Division had won the role of leading the attack into Pyongyang and they began their assault on 18 October. Almost simultaneously with the 1st Cavalry Division's arrival at Pyongyang the ROK 1st Division entered the city on the Sibyon-ni-Pyongyang road at a point northeast of the 1st Cavalry Division. The US and ROK forces cleared the city of KPA by 20 October. ===The Chinese intervene (19 October)=== The destruction of the KPA and the rapid advance of UN forces through North Korea towards the Chinese border on the Yalu River had prompted China's Chairman, Mao Zedong, to order the People's Liberation Army's North East Frontier Force to enter North Korea and engage UN forces under the name People's Volunteer Army (PVA). In order to stabilize the rapidly collapsing Korean front and to push back the advancing UN forces, Mao authorized the First Phase Campaign, a bridgehead- building operation with the aim of destroying ROK II Corps, the vanguard and the right flank of the Eighth Army. After the Chinese leadership finally settled the issue of armed intervention on 18 October, Mao ordered the PVA to enter Korea on 19 October under strict secrecy. ===Sukchon, Sunchon and Yongyu (20–22 October)=== US 187 RCT airdrop at Sukchon and Sunchon, 20–21 October 1950 On 20 October the US 187th Airborne Regimental Combat Team (187th RCT) was parachuted ahead of the advancing UN spearheads into drop zones in Sukchon and Sunchon, 40 kilometres north of Pyongyang, with the objectives of cutting off the retreating KPA forces that were withdrawing up the west coast of the Korean Peninsula and releasing US and South Korean prisoners of war. Although the airborne drop itself was a success, the operation came too late to intercept any significant KPA elements and the US landings initially met little resistance. However, on 21 October as the 187th RCT began to advance south to the clear the Sukchon to Yongyu road towards Pyongyang the Americans came under heavy attack from the KPA 239th Regiment and requested assistance. The British 27th Commonwealth Brigade was ordered to assist the 187th RCT. The brigade crossed the Taedong River at Pyongyang at noon on 21 October, and moved north on the main highway to Sukchon with the task of reaching the Ch'ongch'on River. The 1st Battalion, Argyll and Sutherland Highland Regiment, subsequently pushed up the road until fired upon by KPA forces in the hills to the south of Yongyu. By nightfall the hills were cleared by the Argylls, while the 3rd Battalion, 187th RCT occupied Yongyu. Cut-off, about midnight the KPA 239th Regiment attempted to break out, resulting in heavy fighting. The KPA attacks drove the 187th RCT from Yongyu, forcing them back onto the battalion's main defensive position to the north. 3rd Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment (3 RAR) was ordered to take the lead the following morning. By dawn the Americans again requested assistance. At first light on 22 October, two companies of Argylls advanced into Yongyu, before the Australians passed through them riding on M4 Sherman tanks. Now leading the brigade, at 09:00 the Australians came under fire from a KPA rearguard position in an apple orchard on their right flank. 3 RAR carried out an aggressive attack off the line of march from the road, with US tanks in support. Despite fire support from mortars and artillery being unavailable due to the location of 3/187th RCT being unknown, the Australian attack succeeded and the KPA forces were forced to withdraw from the high ground, having suffered heavy casualties. Meanwhile, 3 RAR's tactical headquarters came under attack and was forced to fight off a group of North Koreans. Having been forced off the high ground, the KPA were now caught between the advancing Australians and the 187th RCT to the north. Attacking the North Koreans from the rear, 3 RAR subsequently relieved the 187th RCT, with the Commonwealth Brigade linked up with them by 11:00. Caught between the 187th RCT and the Commonwealth Brigade, the KPA 239th Regiment was practically destroyed. ===KPA massacre at Sunchon=== After the airdrop, a new task force, formed around the 1st Battalion, 8th Cavalry Regiment, and a company of tanks, 70th Tank Battalion, started from Pyongyang to make junction with the airborne troops at Sunchon. Lieutenant Colonel William M. Rodgers of the tank battalion commanded the task force. It arrived at Sunchon at 09:00 on 21 October, picking up five escaped American prisoners. At the bridge just south of Sunchon, a few KPA troops hiding in holes under it opened fire as Task Force Rodgers came up and killed two men of the 8th Cavalry. The KPA had remained unobserved even though some airborne troops were on the bridge. General Gay and Brigadier General Frank A. Allen, Jr., from an L-5 Sentinel had watched Task Force Rodgers successfully establish contact with the airborne troops. Upon returning to Pyongyang, General Allen climbed into his jeep and accompanied by his aide, his driver, and two war correspondents from the Associated Press and Baltimore Sun, started for Sunchon, arriving there about noon. Allen had been in the command post of the 2nd Battalion, 187th RCT, only a short time when a Korean civilian came in and excitedly told a story of KPA troops murdering about 200 Americans the night before at a railroad tunnel northwest of the town. Allen determined to run down this story at once. His group set out with the Korean civilian and, on the way, stopped at the ROK 6th Division command post in Sunchon. A ROK colonel, an interpreter, and a driver in a second jeep joined Allen and drove with him to a railroad tunnel just beyond the village of Myonguch'am, northwest of Sunchon. They arrived there at 15:00. The railroad ran along a hillside cut and entered the tunnel some distance above the dirt road the men had followed. While the rest waited on the road, the ROK colonel climbed the hillside and entered the tunnel. He came back and said he had found seven dead Americans inside. Allen and the others now climbed to the tunnel. Inside it near the far end they found the seven emaciated bodies on straw mats beside the rail track. These men had either starved to death or died from disease. Some had old wounds, apparently battle wounds. The colonel had walked on through the tunnel. He reappeared at the end and called out that he could see five Americans on the ridge top. Everyone hurried outside and started down the track. A little distance beyond the tunnel, a thin, wounded American soldier staggered from the brush. He was PFC Valdor John, who pointed into the brush. Seventeen dead Americans, all shot, lay there in a gully. John had escaped by feigning death. Allen started climbing the ridge to the Americans who could be seen on top. Whitehead walked off alone across the railroad track into a cornfield on the other side. There he accidentally stumbled upon a semi-circle of fifteen more dead Americans. They had been shot as they sat on the ground with rice bowls in hand expecting to receive food. Whitehead turned back to report to Allen; on his way back three American survivors came from among some bushes to him. Allen brought six more Americans who had escaped down off the ridge. The survivors told the story of what had happened. Two trains, each carrying about 150 American prisoners of war, had left Pyongyang on the night of 17 October, making frequent stops to repair the tracks, and crawling north at a snail's pace. Each day five or six men died of dysentery, starvation, or exposure. Their bodies were removed from the train. A few men escaped as the train traveled north. On the afternoon of 20 October, while the parachute jump was in progress, the second of the two trains stayed in the tunnel northwest of Sunchon to escape the air activity in the vicinity. The group of 100 prisoners of this train, crowded into open coal gondolas and boxcars, was the remnant of 370 whom the KPA had marched north from Seoul more than a month earlier. That evening, the prisoners had been taken from the train in three groups to receive their evening meal. They were shot as they waited for it. The train and the KPA guards left that night. From this story it appeared that there was another group of murdered men yet to be found. A search revealed a fresh burial place, and, upon removal of a thin covering of earth, the men discovered 34 more bodies. Altogether there were 66 dead (exclusive of the seven found in the tunnel) and 23 survivors, some of the latter critically wounded. Two of these died during the night, leaving only 21 who survived. A ROK detachment safely conveyed the rescued Americans and the dead to Pyongyang, where C-54 Skymasters flew them to Japan. ===Advance to Ch'ongch'on (22–24 October)=== UN offensive into North Korea, 20–24 October 1950 Even as the 187th RCT landed at Sukch'on, the Eighth Army intelligence officer was preparing his estimate that the North Koreans would be incapable of making more than a token defense of the Ch'ongch'on River barrier, north of Pyongyang. He predicted that the KPA withdrawal would continue on to the north along the axes of two rail and highway routes, the first bending to the right and leading northeast from Sinanju and Anju on the Ch'ongch'on through Huich'on to Kanggye deep in the rugged mountains of central North Korea, from the Yalu River; and the second, the west coastal route, bending left and running northwest from the Ch'ongch'on River to Sinuiju near the mouth of the Yalu River at the Manchurian border. North Korean radio on 21 October announced that Premier Kim Il Sung's government had established a new capital at Sinuiju, on the south bank of the Yalu and opposite the Chinese city of Andong on the north bank. But the North Korean capital soon moved on to Kanggye, and it was there in the mountains that the remnants of the North Korean Government and military power assembled. The Kanggye-Manp'ojin area, mountainous in the extreme and heavily wooded, was an ideal area in which to fight defensive delaying actions. It had been a stronghold of Korean guerrilla operations during Japanese rule. Many crossings of the Yalu were near at hand, it was centrally located, and it had lateral road communications to both northeast and northwest Korea. On 22 October, C Company, 6th Medium Tank Battalion, designated Task Force Elephant, started from Pyongyang by way of Sunch'on for Kujang-dong to block the railroad there. Passing through Sunch'on, the task force arrived at its objective at 22:00 and then turned west to Kunu-ri, downstream in the valley of the Ch'ongch'on. The ROK 1st Division followed behind the task force. The ROK recovered 40 escaped American prisoners whom they evacuated at once to Pyongyang. Two more escaped prisoners came in at Kunu-ri the next morning, 23 October. That afternoon, a sergeant of the ROK 6th Division found the bodies of 28 American prisoners on the railroad track, and 3 men still alive, north of Kujang-dong. On 23 October General Paik led his division from Kunu-ri down the valley of the Ch'ongch'on. Near Anju, D Company tanks knocked out two T-34 tanks and two self-propelled guns, and captured one tank intact. Just before noon, a platoon of tanks seized the damaged wooden bridge over the Ch'ongch'on River northeast of Anju. A tank patrol continued downstream to Sinanju, which it found deserted and the bridges there across the Ch'ongch'on destroyed. Repair of the Anju bridge began at once and continued through the night. By 09:00 on 24 October wheeled traffic, including 2½-ton trucks, could cross on it. During that morning a reconnaissance party found a tank ford east of the bridge, and the 6th Medium Tank Battalion crossed the river there. All three regiments of the ROK 1st Division crossed the Ch'ongch'on on 23–24 October. The division then attacked northeast toward Unsan. Complying with I Corps' order to continue the advance beyond Pyongyang, advance elements of the 24th Division arrived in an assembly area north of the city on the evening of 22 October, and there the division assumed control of the 27th British Commonwealth Brigade, the 89th Medium Tank Battalion, and the 90th Field Artillery Battalion. Meanwhile, the British Brigade had hurried on northward from Sukch'on. On 23 October it arrived at Sinanju only a few hours after the ROK 1st Division tank patrol entered the town. It also secured the airstrip to the southwest. By this time the 24th Division completed its move to Sunan, north of Pyongyang. The Ch'ongch'on River at Sinanju, not far from the sea, is wide, has tides, and deep mud along its edges. On the 24th the British Middlesex 1st Battalion started crossing in assault boats. The rest of the brigade and the vehicles crossed that night over the ROK 1st Division bridge at Anju. The 3rd Engineer Combat Battalion now worked to clear the highway to Sinanju, and to improve it for carrying the main part of Eighth Army's logistical support in the projected drive to the Manchurian border. While US I Corps on the UN left advanced to the Ch'ongch'on, two divisions of the ROK on its right also took up the advance. The ROK 6th Division turned northeast from Kunu-ri up the Ch'ongch'on River on the road that led through Huich'on to Kanggye. East of it the ROK 8th Division reached Tokch'on at midnight of 23 October. There it turned north and struck the Ch'ongch'on at Kujang-dong two days later. Both the ROK 6th and 8th Divisions were now in exceedingly mountainous country. Near Kunu-ri the ROK 6th Division captured two trains, one carrying 8 tanks, and, farther on, near Kujang-dong, it captured 50 boxcars of ammunition. The division had a hard fight with an estimated regiment of KPA south of Huich'on but dispersed this force and entered Huich'on on the night of the 23rd. There it captured 20 T-34 tanks needing only minor repairs. At Huich'on the ROK 6th Division turned west, and later north, its objective being Ch'osan on the Yalu River. It was now far in front of any UN division. ===Advance to the Yalu (24–30 October)=== Until 17 October General MacArthur's orders, based on the Joint Chiefs of Staff directive of 27 September, had restrained UN ground forces other than ROK troops from operating north of a line extending from Ch'ongju on the west through Kunu-ri and Yongwon to Hamhung on the east coast. On 17 October General MacArthur, in his UNC Operations Order 4, lifted this restriction and advanced northward the line below which all UN ground forces could operate. This new line, confirmed in a message to all commanders on 19 October, extended generally from Sonch'on through Koin-dong-P'yongwon- P'ungsan to Songjin on the east coast. It was generally south of the Manchurian border across the greater part of the peninsula, and was within the spirit and meaning of the Joint Chiefs of Staff directive of 27 September, which was still in effect. In the policy laid down in this directive, only ROK forces were to be used in the provinces of Korea bordering on the Yalu River. But on 24 October, as the leading UN forces crossed the Ch'ongch'on River, General MacArthur issued an order to his ground commanders in Korea which changed all earlier orders drastically. He now removed all restrictions on the use of UN ground forces south of the border, and instructed his commanders to press forward to the northern limits of Korea, utilizing all their forces. Thus, when Eighth Army began what it thought would be the last series of maneuvers to end the war it did so under orders radically different from those that had so far guided its operations in Korea. The day it was issued, this order brought a message from the Joint Chiefs of Staff to MacArthur stating that it was not in accord with the directive of 27 September and asking for an explanation. General MacArthur's reply the next day justified lifting the restriction as a matter of military necessity. He said that the ROK forces could not handle the situation by themselves, that he felt he had enough latitude under existing directives to issue the order, and that, furthermore, the whole subject had been covered in the Wake Island Conference. While it is clear that the Joint Chiefs of Staff felt that MacArthur had violated their basic 27 September directive, they did not countermand his orders to go to the Yalu. When the 27th British Commonwealth Brigade crossed the Ch'ong-ch'on, that unit, the US 24th Infantry Division which followed, and all the other UN troops deployed in Korea, were authorized to go to the Yalu River —to the extreme northern limits of the country. The Ch'ongch'on River and its tributaries, the Kuryong and Taeryong Rivers, all flowing from the north, together form the last major water barrier in the western part of North Korea short of the border. The Ch'ongch'on valley is a wide one for Korea, varying in width from . The Ch'ongch'on, like the Yalu, flows from the northeast to the southwest and it generally parallels the Yalu at a distance of approximately . The Ch'ongch'on River, the principal terrain feature in the field of operations for Eighth Army, largely dictated the army's deployment and tactical maneuvers. The main Pyongyang highway crosses the Ch'ongch'on at Sinanju and runs west and northwest in the coastal area to Sinuiju at the North Korean border. Inland from the west coast, mountainous spines run down from the Yalu to the valley of the Ch'ongch'on and the terrain becomes ever rougher and more forbidding. These mountains reach their greatest heights and become almost trackless wastes in central Korea between the Changjin (Chosin) Reservoir and the Yalu. The Yalu itself, save for its lower west coast reaches, runs through a gorge-like channel rimmed by high mountains on both sides. The Suiho hydroelectric dam on the middle Yalu impounds a reservoir of the same name that extends upstream for , pushing water into hundreds of little lateral fjordlike mountain valleys. Above the reservoir there is a major crossing of the Yalu at Manp'ojin. southeast of Manp'ojin, situated in the very heart of the mountain fastness, is Kanggye. There the North Korean governmental officials and high military commanders assembled. From there, if necessary, they could retreat across the Yalu at Manp'ojin to the sanctuary of Manchuria. From the valley of the Ch'ongch'on the principal road to Kanggye and Manp'ojin ran northeast from the Sinanju- Anju-Kunu-ri area through Huich'on. A railroad followed the same passageway. From the lower valley of the Ch'ongch'on, inland from the west coast, an important secondary road network ran north through Unsan to the Yalu. The events of the next few weeks were to give this particular road net special importance. The configuration of the valley of the lower Ch'ongch'on in relation to the mountain ridges that approach it from the Yalu must be noted. North of the lower Ch'ongch'on for a distance of approximately the ground is flat or only slightly rising with occasional low hills. A lateral road extending eastward from Yongsan-dong and generally paralleling the river marks the cleavage line between this low ground, which in a broad sense can be described as the valley of the Ch'ongch'on, and the mountain spurs that rise rather abruptly from it and extend to the Yalu. The southern extremities of these mountain ranges with their limited corridors of passage form a natural defensive barrier to a military advance northward. The towns of Taech'on, Unsan and Onjong stand at the entrances to these mountain corridors. The Eighth Army operation above the Ch'ongch'on began essentially as a continuation of the pursuit that had started with the breakout from the Pusan Perimeter; US I Corps was on the left, ROK II Corps on the right. Within I Corps, the 24th Division (27th Commonwealth Brigade attached) was on the left, the ROK 1st Division on the right. The UN Command expected little organized opposition from the KPA and emphasized a speedy advance to the northern border. Several columns were to strike out northward with little or no physical contact between them. The advance was not to be closely co-ordinated; each column was free to advance as fast and as far as possible without respect to gains made by others. ===The ROK 6th Division reaches the Yalu (24–26 October)=== As Eighth Army resumed its general advance toward the North Korean border, the ROK 6th Division of ROK II Corps appeared to have the greatest success of any front-line UN division. Meeting no serious opposition and traveling fast up the valley of the Ch'ongch'on, it reached Huich'on the night of 23 October. There it left the valley of the Ch'ongch'on and turned west, the 7th Regiment leading. Its advanced battalion marched northwest over a cart trail, but the remainder of the regiment had to turn west from Huich'on on a road to Onjong. The night of 24–25 October, the 7th Regiment passed through Onjong, then turned north and joined its advanced battalion. Finding the road clear, it headed north for its objective, the town of Ch'osan, away on the Yalu. Late in the afternoon the regiment stopped at Kojang, a sizable town south of Ch'osan, and bivouacked there for the night. The next morning, 26 October, Maj. Harry Fleming, KMAG adviser with the ROK 7th Regiment, accompanied the Reconnaissance Platoon, reinforced, into Ch'osan. The remainder of the regiment stayed at its overnight position. In Ch'osan the Reconnaissance Platoon found North Koreans retreating into Manchuria across a narrow floating footbridge that spanned the Yalu. Fleming and the ROK officers directed the setting up of machine guns to halt this foot traffic into Manchuria, but placed the weapons so that the impact area of their fire would not be in China across the river. After a thorough reconnaissance of the town, Fleming and the main body of the Reconnaissance Platoon returned to the regimental position. They left a small party in Ch'osan because the next morning the main force of the ROK 7th Regiment was to come into the town. The Reconnaissance Platoon from the 7th Regiment, ROK 6th Division, was the first UN unit to reach the northern border of North Korea, and, as events turned out, it was the only element operating under Eighth Army command ever to get there during the war. Following behind the 6th Division, the ROK 8th Division had reached the valley of the Ch'ongch'on at Kujangdong the night of 25–26 October, marching from Sunch'on through Tokch'on. On the 26th, the day the advanced elements of the 6th Division reached the Yalu, the 8th turned up the Ch'ongch'on Valley toward Huich'on for the purpose of joining the 6th Division. ===Battle of Kujin (25–26 October)=== On 25 October the 27th Commonwealth Brigade had resumed their advance towards Pakchon after crossing the Ch'ongch'on River, with 3 RAR as the lead battalion. Arriving at Kujin, the Australians discovered that the centre span of the concrete bridge had been demolished by North Korean engineers, blocking their passage across the river. A platoon-sized reconnaissance patrol crossed the river using debris from the destroyed span; however, it was soon forced to withdraw by North Koreans holding the high ground. The subsequent battle continued until midday on 26 October when the KPA withdrew. Commonwealth Brigade losses were 8 killed while KPA losses were 100 killed and 350 captured. ===Chinese First Phase Campaign (25 October – 6 November)=== The Chinese First Phase Campaign, 25 October – 1 November The first engagements by the PVA would be in the Battles of Onjong, Unsan and Pakchon in which they probed the strength of the UN forces and identified weak points. At Onjong from 25 to 29 October 1950, the PVA 40th Army conducted a series of ambushes against the ROK 6th Infantry Division of II Corps, effectively destroying the right flank of the United States Eighth Army while stopping the Eighth Army from advancing further towards the Yalu River. Exploiting the situation, the PVA launched another attack on the now exposed Eighth Army center on 1 November, resulting in the loss of the ROK 15th Infantry Regiment and the US 8th Cavalry Regiment at Unsan. With the Chinese forces pouring into the rear of the UN lines, the Eighth Army was forced to retreat to the Ch'ongch'on River. US losses were 449 killed and ROK losses were 530 killed. PVA losses were estimated at over 600 killed. During the night of 4–5 November, the PVA mounted a full-scale assault on the US 24th Infantry Division, pushing back the 19th Infantry Regiment nearly 2 kilometres. The PVA subsequently turned west, advancing between the Taeryong and Chongchon rivers and threatening the rear of the 27th Commonwealth Brigade by cutting the Pakchon–Sinanju road. On 5 November the PVA attacked C Battery, 61st Field Artillery Battalion which was guarding a bridge near Kujin. The Commonwealth Brigade then successfully counterattacked the Chinese forces occupying a number of nearby ridgelines during the day but were in turn counter-attacked before being pushed off the high ground during the night. Following heavy fighting, the assault unexpectedly ceased after midnight and the PVA were observed beginning to withdraw. Commonwealth losses were 14 killed and PVA losses were 270 killed. On 4 November PVA forces drove hard for Kunu-ri. Hill 622, a large mountain cresting northeast of Kunu-ri, dominated the town, the valley of the Ch'ongch'on, and the rail and highway communication lines passing along it. The 3rd and 5th Regiments of the ROK 7th Division held this key terrain feature, with the US 5th Regimental Combat Team, 24th Division, in blocking position just behind them. The ROK 8th Regiment was in reserve along the road east of Kunu-ri. That morning a strong PVA attack broke the ROK 3rd Regiment position on the mountain and ROK soldiers began streaming back through the 5th RCT. The commanding officer of C Company stopped and reorganized these ROK troops and sent them back to retake the hill. The ROK 8th Regiment was now also committed to the battle. The hill changed hands several times throughout the day, but at dark ROK troops held its vital northwest ridge. The 5th RCT itself had heavy fighting in this battle to hold Kunu-ri, and was forced to withdraw about . Part of the fighting was at close quarters. By evening the PVA attack in estimated division strength (elements of the CCF 38th Army) had been repulsed. The ROK 7th Division and 5th Regimental Combat Team had saved Kunu-ri and successfully protected the right flank of Eighth Army. Simultaneously with this attack south of the Ch'ongch'on against Kunu-ri, the PVA struck the bridgehead force north of the river. On 4 November both ground and aerial observers reported approximately 1,000 enemy soldiers crossing the Kuryong River northwest of the 1st Battalion, 19th Infantry, and moving south through wooded terrain, evidently intent on getting into the rear of the battalion. The enemy maneuver succeeded. PVA troops captured the battalion's radio while the operator was using it to report the situation to the regimental headquarters. The battalion did not make much of a fight, and, after destroying and abandoning its heavy equipment and vehicles, it withdrew eastward and infiltrated across the Kuryong and Ch'ongch'on Rivers to friendly positions. Nearly all the men escaped. Meanwhile, a task force of the 3rd Battalion, 19th Infantry, subsequently reinforced by the entire battalion, tried to drive through to the 1st Battalion's position, but strong PVA forces on the road repelled it. With these difficulties developing in the bridgehead area, General Church ordered Brig. Gen. Garrison H. Davidson, the assistant division commander of the 24th Division, to assume command of all 24th Division troops north of the Ch'ongch'on and to co-ordinate the actions of the 27th Commonwealth Brigade and the division troops. Davidson arrived at the 19th Infantry command post shortly after noon on the 4th to assume command of Task Force Davidson. The worsening situation caused General Church at 16:30 also to order the 21st Infantry Regiment to cross to the north side of the Ch'ongch'on River during the night and attack the next day, to clear the PVA from the 19th Infantry area and restore the bridgehead line. A PVA force made a further penetration in the 19th Infantry zone during the night, but the next morning, 5 November, the 2nd and 3rd Battalions, 21st Infantry, attacked and restored the position. Fleeing the battle area, hordes of refugees crossed the Ch'ongch'on; 20,000 of them passed through the checking points on the south side of the river on 4–5 November. On the west, there was a gap between the left flank of the 19th Infantry bridgehead position and the 27th Commonwealth Brigade position. A large mountain mass lay in this no man's land, and over and through it PVA forces could move at will to the flank and rear of either the 27th Brigade or the 19th Infantry. On the 19th Infantry's extreme left flank at the edge of this gap the 2nd Battalion held Hill 123 which overlooked a valley near the little village of Ch'onghyon, above the Ch'ongch'on. On the night of 5–6 November the PVA made a coordinated attack all along the bridgehead line. At Hill 123 the attack achieved surprise against E and G Companies, 19th Infantry. At least part of the PVA assault force came up to E Company's position from the rear, apparently following field telephone wire. The PVA caught many men asleep in their sleeping bags and killed them where they lay. Others were shot in the back of the head. The PVA virtually overran the battalion positions on Hill 123. Cpl. Mitchell Red Cloud Jr. gave the first alarm to E Company from his position on the point of the ridge where a trail climbed to the company command post. A group of PVA suddenly charged him from a brush-covered area away. Red Cloud sprang to his feet and fired his BAR into them. PVA fire wounded and felled him, but he pulled himself to his feet, wrapped one arm around a small tree, and again delivered point-blank BAR fire until he was killed. Red Cloud was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor for his actions. By 03:00 the battalion had withdrawn 1,000 yards. There it was only barely able to hold its new position. After daylight the PVA withdrew from contact with the 2nd Battalion. Elsewhere the other battalions on the 19th Infantry front repulsed the attacks on them after hard fighting. Artillery firing from the south side of the Ch'ongch'on supported the 19th Infantry during the bridgehead battles. After daylight the re-equipped 1st Battalion, 19th Infantry, which had re-crossed to the north side of the Ch'ongch'on during the night, counterattacked and closed the gap between the 2nd Battalion and the rest of the regiment on its right. The 19th Regiment then began restoring its original bridgehead line. In these night battles of predawn 6 November the PVA had suffered heavy losses. On 8 November the 2nd Battalion alone counted 474 PVA dead in the vicinity of Hill 123, and it found evidence that many more dead had been buried. The 3rd Battalion, 19th Infantry, counted more than 100 PVA dead. Interrogation of prisoners disclosed that the PVA 355th Regiment, 119th Division; the 358th Regiment, 120th Division; and a KPA regiment had attacked the 19th Infantry on the east side of the bridgehead. By 6 November logistics difficulties forced the Chinese to end the First Phase Campaign and their forces were observed withdrawing northwards. ===ROK I Corps advances towards the Chosin Reservoir (24–30 October)=== ROK I Corps had attacked north from the Hamhung area, the 3rd Division north toward the Chosin Reservoir and the Capital Division northeast up the coastal road. The 26th Regiment led the advance for the ROK 3rd Division. On the morning of 25 October two battalions of the regiment approached the first and second hydroelectric plants of the Chosin Reservoir area, about inland from Hungnam, and halfway to the reservoir itself. A message from Maj. Malcolm Smith, KMAG adviser with the regiment, to Colonel Emmerich that evening informed him that the regiment had captured a prisoner definitely identified as a Chinese soldier who said he belonged to the 5th Regiment of the 8th Army. This prisoner said there were 4,000 to 5,000 Chinese in the immediate vicinity. During the next two days, the ROK regiment moved ahead very slowly against increasing resistance. On the morning of 28 October the ROK attacked in the vicinity of Sudong in what proved to be a very costly action and suffered heavy casualties. ROK patrols to the Sinhung-ni and Koto- ri areas brought back news that they had seen at both places what they believed to be Chinese soldiers. That day two PVA soldiers were captured west of Sudong. All day of the 29th small arms close combat continued in the large fields around the second hydroelectric plant. In the afternoon enemy 120mm fire increased. The ROK troops at the same time began to show signs of demoralization as their supply of grenades ran low. In the fighting on this day, the ROK captured sixteen more PVA soldiers and learned from them that the 370th Regiment, 124th Division, 42nd Army, blocked the way north, with the rest of the division nearby. KPA tanks supported these Chinese. The PVA division and regimental headquarters reportedly were at Hagaru-ri at the southern end of the Reservoir. On the 30th, after a heavy battle with the Chinese, the ROK 26th Regiment withdrew a short distance to a stronger defensive position. The capture of the sixteen PVA on the 29th was a considerable prize, and General Kim, the ROK I Corps commander, telephoned the news to General Almond. On 30 October, General Almond went to the ROK I Corps command post at Hamhung and personally inspected the captives and interviewed them through an interpreter. The Chinese told him they had not eaten for three days. They said they had crossed the Yalu River at Manp'ojin on 16 October (later they said they had crossed on the 14th) and had marched from there on foot at night, their mortars being carried on packhorses and mules. Most of the sixteen soldiers were members of the Mortar Company, 370th Regiment. At the time of their capture they said three of their four mortars had been destroyed and the fourth had been withdrawn. The men were well-clothed, healthy, and averaged twenty-eight to thirty years in age. They asserted that their entire division had crossed into Korea and marched to the front. Most of the men in this division had been in Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalist Army, stationed near Beijing, until about a year earlier, they said. Their division had surrendered there to the Communists and was immediately taken into the PLA. General Almond at once sent a personal radio message to General MacArthur informing him of the presence of Chinese units in northeast Korea and giving such details as he had learned in the course of his interview with the prisoners. The 370th Regiment apparently arrived at its positions near Sudong on 23 or 24 October and first encountered ROK troops on the 25th. Behind it came the other two regiments of the 124th Division, the 371st and 372nd, one a few days behind the other. When General Almond visited General Kim again on 31 October, he learned that seven more PVA prisoners had been captured to make a total of twenty-five now in the X Corps zone. Some of them said a second PVA division was near the Chosin Reservoir. A search of enemy dead showed they carried no official identification, although a few had written their names and units in ink on the left inside of their blouses. These soldiers were armed mostly with Japanese rifles confiscated in Manchuria at the end of World War II. The greater part of their mortars, machine guns, and Thompson submachine guns were American-made, having been captured from the Nationalists. Having left its artillery behind because of the mountains, the 124th Division in the battle below the reservoir used nothing larger than 82-mm. mortars. ===X Corps comes ashore (26–29 October)=== After steaming back and forth from 19 to 25 October in the Sea of Japan just outside the Wonsan channel, it was a great relief to everyone afloat when twenty-one transports and fifteen LSTs came into Wonsan harbor on 25 October and dropped anchor off Blue and Yellow Beaches. X Corps began a quiet, administrative landing at 07:30 on 26 October. At 10:00 27 October the command post of the 1st Marine Division closed aboard the USS Mount McKinley and opened in Wonsan. By the close of 28 October, all combat elements of the division were ashore. Meanwhile, the 7th Division had remained idly afloat at Pusan for ten days. Finally, on 27 October it received orders to proceed to Iwon, above Wonsan, and to unload there across the beaches. Because the X Corps mission by now had been changed to advancing northward instead of westward from Wonsan, General Almond decided to land the 7th Division as close as possible to its axis of advance inland toward North Korea's northern border. This was to be the Pukch'ŏng-P'ungsan-Hyesan road to the Yalu. On receipt of the changed orders, the 17th Regimental Combat Team (17th RCT), which was to be first ashore, had to unload its unit equipment from its transports at Pusan and reload combat equipment onto LST, in order to be prepared to land on a possibly hostile beach. This done, seven LST with the 17th RCT aboard left Pusan on 27 October and headed up the coast for Iwon. The landing proved to be without danger for the minesweepers found no mines there, and the ROK Capital Division had captured and passed through the town several days earlier. The 17th Infantry landed over the beaches at Iwon unopposed on the morning of the 29th. Except for most of its tanks, the 7th Division completed unloading there on 9 November. On 26 October General Almond issued orders for his plan of operation. In its zone, the 1st Marine Division was split into three regimental combat teams: (1) the 1st Marine Regiment to relieve ROK I Corps elements in the Kojo and Majonni areas south and west of Wonsan; (2) the 5th Marine Regiment was to secure the Wonsan area, the Yonpo Airfield south of Hungnam, and the X Corps west flank; and (3) the 7th Marine Regiment was to relieve the ROK 3rd Division along the Hamhung-Chosin Reservoir corridor and to secure the power installations of the Chosin and Pujon Reservoirs (). X Corps' landings at Wonsan and Iwon were a strategic error diverting limited resources away from the pursuit of the KPA to pointless landings on territory already held by the ROK. In addition, the split command with X Corps operating separately from Eighth Army violated US Army doctrine of unified command. ===ROK I Corps advances to the Manchurian border (26 October – 17 November)=== Following the landing of US X Corps at Wonsan, the ROK Capital Division, already north of Hungnam, continued its attack northward in three regimental combat teams. The ROK Cavalry Regiment of the division, a motorized organization, constituted what General Almond called the \\"flying column.\\" It was to advance as rapidly as possible toward the border. Almond made arrangements for supplying this flying column from an LST at sea, and he provided it with a tactical air control party from the 7th Infantry Division. On 28 October, the ROK Cavalry Regiment against strong opposition captured Songjin, northeast of Hungnam. At the same time, the 1st Regiment of the Capital Division approached P'ungsan, inland halfway to the border on the Iwon-Sinch'ang-ni- Hyesanjin road. Two days later the third regiment of the division, the 18th, reached the south end of Pujon Reservoir. In front of the ROK Cavalry Regiment on the coastal road an estimated KPA battalion retreated northward toward Kilchu, a sizable town north of Songjin, inland from the coast, the farthest point inland for a town of any size along the whole length of the east coastal road. Situated beyond the reach of effective naval gunfire, it was a favorable place for the North Koreans to fight a delaying action. The ROK attack before daylight of 3 November developed into a day-long battle which failed to win the town. The ROK 1st Regiment joined the Cavalry Regiment in the battle. By daylight of 5 November the two ROK regiments had encircled Kilchu, and they captured it before noon. On the day of Kilchu's capture F4U Corsair air strikes from the 1st Marine Air Wing were credited with destroying 2 KPA tanks, 4 artillery pieces and 350 KPA dead. The next day a count of all the North Korean dead reached 530. In the Kilchu battle, the ROK captured 9 45mm antitank guns, 6 82mm mortars, and 10 heavy machine guns. The ROK Cavalry Regiment lost 21 killed and 91 wounded. Prisoners said the KPA 507th Brigade had defended the town. The local North Korean commander reportedly ordered the execution of a battalion commander whose unit had retreated. After the Kilchu battle, aerial reports indicated that fresh KPA troops were moving south along the coastal road from the Ch'ongjin-Nanam area. Supported by tanks, this force, estimated at six to seven battalions, met the Capital Division on 12 November just north of the Orang-ch'on, above Kilchu. In the resulting battle, it forced the ROK 18th Regiment to withdraw south of the stream. Bad weather prevented effective close air support, and, since the scene of action was beyond the range of destroyers' guns, the heavy cruiser was sent to provide naval gunfire support. Clearing weather enabled Corsairs to join in the battle on the 13th, and that afternoon an air strike destroyed two tanks, damaged a third, and forced another to withdraw. Six inches of snow covered the Orang-ch'on battlefield. The KPA attack resumed and made further penetrations in the positions of the 18th Regiment on 14 November. The next day it compelled the 18th and the 1st Regiments to withdraw again. Close air support for the ROK prevented the KPA from exploiting this success and during the day destroyed 3 more tanks, 2 self-propelled guns, and 12 trucks. At the same time, thirty B-29's dropped 40,000 incendiary bombs on Hoeryong, a rail and road communication center of 45,000 population on the Tumen River at the Manchurian border, southwest of Vladivostok. By 16 November the four days of ground battle and three of aerial attack had so weakened the KPA force that it faltered, and the ROK 18th Regiment once more advanced slowly. A delayed report covering the three days from the evening of 14 November to that of 17 November listed 1,753 KPA killed, 105 prisoners, and the capture of 4 rapid-fire guns, 62 light machine guns, 101 submachine guns and 649 rifles. On the 19th, air attacks destroyed 2 more tanks and 2 artillery pieces. The now gave naval gunfire support to the ROK. The KPA force that fought the battle of the Orangch'on consisted of about 6,000 troops of the KPA 507th Brigade and a regiment of the KPA 41st Division, supported by a battalion of 8 tanks. The ROK troops fought these battles in northeast Korea under worsening weather conditions. On 16 November the temperature in their zone already had dropped to 16° below zero. By 17 November the ROK 3rd Division had moved up behind the Capital Division on the coastal road and had started its 23rd Regiment inland from Songjin toward Hapsu. The next day its 22nd Regiment started for the same objective from farther north at Kilchu. The larger part of the ROK 3rd Division, therefore, was now deployed on the left of and inland from the Capital Division. Six LST's of the Korean Navy supplied ROK I Corps. Able at last to resume its advance after the battle of the preceding week, the Capital Division on 20 November crossed the Orang-ch'on and resumed its drive toward Ch'ongjin, the big industrial center north of the river and southwest of the Siberian border. A little more than a month earlier a naval task force had heavily bombarded Ch'ongjin with 1,309 rounds of 6-inch, 400 rounds of 8-inch, and 163 rounds of 16-inch shells. ROK troops, following behind a rolling barrage of naval gunfire, enveloped Ch'ongjin on 25 November. That evening the 1st Regiment moved around the city to a point north of it; the Cavalry Regiment seized the airfield on its western edge; and the 18th Regiment was on its southern outskirts. The next day, Ch'ongjin fell to the Capital Division. The ROK's now planned to turn due north and inland along the highway and railroad leading to Hoeryong at the Manchurian border. ===Battle of Chongju (29–30 October)=== On 29 October 3 RAR took over as lead battalion of the 27th Commonwealth Brigade 6 kilometres from Chongju. As they approached Chongju, aerial reconnaissance reported a battalion-sized force of 500–600 KPA infantry supported by several tanks and at least two self-propelled guns, positioned on a thickly wooded ridgeline around Chongju. The Australians launched a series of company attacks with M4 Sherman tanks and aircraft in support. Despite heavy resistance, the KPA were forced to withdraw and the Australians captured their objectives after three hours of fighting. That evening the KPA counterattacked 3 RAR suffering serious casualties but failing to overrun their positions. On 30 October 3 RAR advanced to the high ground overlooking Chongju, killing and capturing a number of North Koreans in skirmishes. That afternoon the town itself was cleared by the remaining elements of the 27th Commonwealth Brigade without opposition. KPA losses were 162 killed and 10 captured and 11 tanks and 2 self-propelled guns destroyed. Commonwealth losses were 9 killed including 3 RAR commander Lt. Col. Charles Green. ===US 7th Infantry Division advance to the Yalu River (29 October – 23 November)=== Following the landing of the 17th Infantry Regiment at Iwon on 29 October, the US 7th Infantry Division began operations between ROK I Corps to the north and the 1st Marine Division to the south. On 29 October the 1st Battalion, 17th Regiment; the 49th Field Artillery Battalion; and A Company, 13th Engineer Combat Battalion moved from the beachhead to Cho-ri, a distance of . From Cho-ri the 7th Division was to strike north for the Manchurian border at Hyesanjin, away. But over the poor dirt road that twisted its way through the mountains and the Korean upland the distance was much greater. On 31 October the 1st Battalion and regimental headquarters moved on to P'ungsan, from the Iwon beaches and approximately halfway between the coast and Hyesanjin. The 1st Regiment of the ROK Capital Division had cleared the road of KPA troops that far. When the 7th Division got all its elements ashore its total strength would exceed 26,600 men. The division on 1 November counted 18,837 men, almost full-strength, and to this were added 7,804 attached South Korean soldiers. The 7th Infantry Division had its initial action in northeast Korea on 1 November when the 1st Battalion, 17th Infantry, helped the ROK 1st Regiment repulse a strong KPA attack north of P'ungsan. Col. Herbert B. Powell, commander of the 17th Infantry Regiment, ordered an attack by the 1st Battalion the next morning at 08:00 to clear the KPA force from in front of the town. But the KPA in approximately regimental strength attacked first, at 07:00, starting an action that continued throughout the day. Except for one company, all units of the 17th Regiment arrived at P'ungsan by the end of the day. Colonel Powell's regiment now relieved the ROK 1st Regiment, which turned back to join the Capital Division on the coastal road. Because the open beaches were wholly at the mercy of the weather and high seas, unloading of the 7th Infantry Division at Iwon went forward slowly. The relatively few vehicles ashore, the long haul and the low stockpile on the beach combined to cause the 17th Infantry on 4 November to request an airdrop at P'ungsan of 4.2inch, 81mm, and 60mm mortar ammunition. An airdrop the next day had considerable breakage loss. Patrols on the 4th discovered the KPA had withdrawn from in front of P'ungsan, and the 17th Infantry advanced unopposed to the Ungi River. The temperature stood at 2° below zero. At the Iwon beachhead, the 3rd Battalion, 31st Infantry Regiment, landed on 3 November and the rest of the regiment followed ashore the next day. The regimental mission was to move to the left (west) flank of the 17th Infantry. This would place it in the mountainous country extending to the Pujon Reservoir. ROK troops previously had advanced into that region. Carrying out its mission, the 31st Infantry Regiment advanced on the division left flank toward the reservoir. On 8 November it encountered Chinese soldiers on the eastern slopes of Paek-san, a peak east of the southern end of the reservoir. This was the 7th Division's first contact with the PVA. There, during the afternoon, elements of the regiment engaged in a battle with an estimated battalion of PVA, later identified as part of the 376th Regiment, 126th Division. Before nightfall, the 31st Infantry seized that part of Paek- san, and the PVA force withdrew with at least 50 killed. On this same day a patrol of the regiment met a Marine patrol about midway between Hamhung and the Pujon Reservoir, thus establishing the first contact between the two divisions in northeast Korea. On the division right flank on 9 November, the 7th Reconnaissance Company moved to Sillyong, east of P'ungsan, to protect a power installation. On 12 November the division received orders from X Corps to continue the advance northward. The 17th Infantry was to seize Kapsan, and then go to Hyesanjin on the Yalu; the 31st Infantry was to advance on the left of the 17th; and the 32nd Infantry Regiment was to seize the southeast shore of the Pujon Reservoir. The 32nd Infantry, which began unloading on 4 November and was the last of the regiments to come ashore at Iwon, moved southwest from the beach along the coast through Hamhung and there turned northeast to Tangp'ang-ni in preparation for its part in the operation. In accordance with the Corps' order, the 17th Infantry prepared to attack across the Ungi River on 14 November. To replace the bridge which the North Koreans had blown, Colonel Powell had ROK troops in the regiment construct a floating footbridge made of planking extending between empty oil drums. KPA fire on the bridge site was at long range and ineffective. The 2nd Battalion, 17th Infantry, crossed over this footbridge without difficulty on the 14th and proceeded to the attack. The 3rd Battalion was scheduled to cross the river at the same time over a shallow ford a few miles to the east. During the night of 13–14 November KPA forces apparently opened dams upstream. The water level rose , making the river waist-deep. In the face of heavy small arms and some mortar fire, six men of L Company waded the stream in weather 7° below zero. A few other men entered the water, but it soon became apparent that all who crossed the stream would be frozen and out of action in a few minutes unless they were specially cared for. The battalion commander ordered the men who had crossed to the north side to return. Their clothes had to be cut from them. They were then wrapped in blankets and taken to the 3rd Battalion command post tent to warm. Casualties from this abortive crossing attempt were 1 killed, 6 wounded, and 18 men suffering frostbite from exposure in the river. Colonel Powell agreed with the battalion commander that the 3rd Battalion could not cross by wading the icy water. Both Generals Barr and Almond concurred in this decision. The battalion subsequently crossed over the oil drum footbridge. The need for shelters and warming areas for the front-line troops led the 7th Division the next day to request the immediate delivery of 250 squad tents and 500 oil-burning stoves. In order to keep vehicle gasoline lines and carburetors from freezing it was necessary to mix alcohol or alcohol-base antifreeze with gasoline. On 15 November, the 1st Battalion crossed the Ungi River behind the 2nd Battalion and moved up on its left, but the two battalions made only small gains. On the 16th, aerial observers reported the KPA forces separating into small groups and withdrawing toward Kapsan. That day the 17th Regiment gained about . On the 19th, the 1st Battalion seized Kapsan at 10:30 after a co-ordinated infantry, tank and artillery attack. In this action the 17th Tank Company overran KPA troops in their foxholes, while the heavy fire of the 15th Anti-aircraft Artillery Battalion 40mm weapons drove other North Koreans from log-covered trenches and pillboxes and then cut them down. Under cover of the combined fire of the tanks and the antiaircraft weapons, the infantry then crossed the river. That night the 1st Battalion was north of Kapsan, only by road from Hyesanjin on the Yalu. The 2nd and 3rd Battalions followed behind the 1st Battalion. The regimental command post set up in Kapsan for the night. The next day, 20 November, the 17th Regiment in a column of battalions the 1st, 3rd, and 2nd in that order advanced on foot over icy roads through and over the mountains to a point only a few miles from the Yalu. Small KPA groups opposed the advance with only brief exchanges of fire and then fled. On the morning of 21 November, without opposition, the 1st Battalion, 17th Infantry, led the way into Hyesanjin, and by 10:00 had occupied the town and surrounding ground to the banks of the Yalu River. General Almond had flown into Kapsan on the 20th and, together with General Barr and Colonel Powell, accompanied the leading elements of the 17th Infantry Regiment into the town. A week earlier, on the 13th, Navy carrier planes had attacked the military camp at Hyesanjin, burning the barracks buildings and warehouses. The town was now about 85 percent destroyed by this and earlier aerial action. The Yalu River at Hyesanjin is not the great river it becomes near its mouth at Sinuiju. At Hyesanjin, near its source on the southwest slopes of the high Nam P'otae-san, the Yalu was approximately wide. On the day the 17th Infantry first stood on its banks the river was frozen over except for a wide channel; four days later it was completely frozen over. The bridge across the stream at Hyesanjin had been destroyed before the 17th Infantry arrived there. Upstream about on the north side of the Yalu in Manchuria there was an undamaged Chinese village larger than Hyesanjin. Officers and men of the 17th Infantry had mixed emotions, some apprehensive, as they looked across the ribbon of ice and water into Manchuria. There they saw Chinese sentries walk their rounds and their officers come and go. Meanwhile, to the southwest, the 31st Infantry Regiment patrolled extensively and advanced in its zone. This mountainous waste was virtually roadless, and ox-drawn carts were used to transport supplies and evacuate wounded. On 15 November a patrol from the 3rd Battalion, 31st Infantry, reached the eastern shore of Pujon Reservoir. The next day another patrol encountered about 200 PVA soldiers at the northern end of the reservoir and drove them away after a brief fight. On the 18th, patrols ranged both sides of the reservoir. Leaving strong detachments to guard the mountain passes from the reservoir eastward into the division's rear along the Cho-ri-P'ungsan road, General Barr on 20 November began moving the bulk of the 31st and 32d Regiments to the P'ungsan-Kapsan area behind the 17th Infantry. On the division right, ROK troops finally arrived at Sillyong shortly before midnight of the 20th to relieve I Company, 32nd Infantry. In the darkness, each group at first thought the other the enemy and a brief firefight resulted in the wounding of five ROK's. The 32nd Infantry Regiment, concentrating now at Kapsan, prepared to strike northwest through Samsu to Sin'galp'ajin on the Yalu. This would put it on the Manchurian border to the left or west of the 17th Regiment at Hyesanjin. Task Force Kingston, commanded by 2nd Lt. Robert C. Kingston, a platoon leader of K Company, started for Samsu on 22 November and entered the town unopposed at midafternoon, followed later by the rest of the 3rd Battalion, less I Company. The 17th Infantry at Hyesanjin was to co- operate with the 32nd Infantry by attacking west to meet it. On 22 November, the first day that it attempted to move west to join the 32nd Infantry, one of its patrols encountered a force of KPA about west of Hyesanjin, and a stubborn fight developed. This set a pattern of action that occupied the 17th Infantry during the next week, daily fights with small but stubborn enemy forces that blew bridges, cratered roads, all but immobilized the Regiment, and kept it from making any appreciable gains. At the same time, in front of the 32nd Infantry, KPA forces fought effective delaying actions north of Samsu so that not until 28 November did Task Force Kingston, reinforced, reach Sin'galp'ajin. The intense cold of northeast Korea in late November took its toll in frostbite casualties in the 7th Division. The worst to suffer was the 31st Infantry which operated in the remote mountain regions east of the Pujon Reservoir. A total of 142 men in the division were treated for frostbite up to 23 November; 83 of them were from the 31st Regiment. Of the 58 men evacuated because of frostbite, 33 were from that regiment. ===US 3rd Infantry Division (5–25 November)=== During November the US 3rd Infantry Division joined X Corps in Korea. The 65th Infantry Regiment was the first part of the 3rd Division to come ashore at Wonsan on 5–6 November. A division advance party opened the 3rd Division tactical command post at Wonsan on 10 November. The 15th Regimental Combat Team began unloading there on the 11th and the 7th Regimental Combat Team finished landing on 17 November. The 3rd Division's primary mission was to relieve all 1st Marine Division troops in the Wonsan area and south of Hamhung, to block the main roads in the southern part of the Corps' zone against guerrillas and bypassed KPA, and to protect the Wonsan-Hungnam coastal strip. The 3rd Division zone of responsibility measured approximately by , an area so large as to make centralized division control impracticable. Therefore, Robert H. Soule, the division commander, decided to establish four regimental combat teams (RCTs) and to assign sectors and missions to each. These were the 7th RCT supported by the 10th Field Artillery Battalion; the 15th RCT, supported by the 39th Field Artillery Battalion; the 65th RCT, supported by the 58th Armored Artillery Battalion (self-propelled guns) and C Company, 64th Heavy Tank Battalion; and the ROK 26th Regiment, 3rd Division (attached to the US 3rd Division for operations), supported by A Battery, 96th Field Artillery Battalion. The 15th RCT had the mission of protecting Wonsan and the area south and west of the city, with the Wonsan- Majon-ni-Tongyang road the probable axis of major KPA activity. North of the 15th RCT, the 65th RCT was to hold the west-central part of the division zone, with the Yonghung- Hadongsan-ni lateral road the principal route into the regimental sector from the coast. The northern sector of the division zone, west of Hamhung, fell to the ROK 26th Regiment; included among its missions was that of patrolling west to the Eighth Army-X Corps boundary. The 7th RCT was in 3rd Division reserve with the mission of securing the coastal area from Chung-dong, a point about eight miles north of Wonsan, to Hungnam. The 64th Heavy Tank Battalion was also in division reserve. The 3rd Division did not engage in any major military operations, but beginning on 12 November it did have a number of engagements with KPA forces in ambushes and roadblocks along the regimental main supply routes, particularly in the sector of the 15th RCT west of Wonsan between Majon-ni and Tongyang. Several of these were serious and resulted in heavy losses of men and equipment. They grew progressively worse toward the end of November; apparently the KPA actions were co-ordinated with Chinese intervention in the reservoir area of northeast Korea. ===1st Marine Division in the Chosin Reservoir (29 October – 25 November)=== Map of the Chosin Reservoir area While the ROK I Corps and the US 7th Infantry Division advanced toward the northeast border of Korea against scattered and ineffective KPA opposition, the 1st Marine Division began moving up its assigned axis of advance toward the Chosin Reservoir to the southwest of them. Unknown to them was that the PVA was preparing a trap for the Marines by sending strong forces behind them, all along the single road leading up to the Chosin Reservoir to cut them off. At 07:30 on 29 October, the 1st Battalion, 7th Marines, began loading into trucks at Wonsan and an hour later it started on the trip to Hamhung. The next day X Corps ordered the 1st Marine Division to relieve ROK I Corps in the reservoir area. At the end of the month, the 7th Marine Regiment was in an assembly area north of Hamhung and the 5th Marine Regiment was en route there from Wonsan. From Hamhung to the southern tip of the Chosin Reservoir the road climbs for . For slightly more than half the distance, to Chinhung-ni, the climb was easy and gradual over a two-lane road. From there a one-lane dirt road zigzagged up precipitous slopes to the high plateau lying just south of the reservoir. In an air-line distance of and a road distance of north of Chinhung-ni, the road climbs in elevation to the rim of the plateau, south of Kot'o-ri (). A narrow-gauge railroad paralleled the road from Hamhung to Chinhung-ni, but from that point to the top of the plateau a cable car incline replaced it. Once on top of the plateau, the railroad track continued north to Hagaru-ri (now Changjin-ŭp) () and the Chosin Reservoir. There were four mountain power plants on the road to the reservoir. by road below Chinhung-ni is the village of Sudong (). There, just below the steep climb to the plateau, the PVA 124th Division held its blocking position. south of Sudong the road, climbing northward, crosses from the west to the east side of a mountain stream. The bridge at this crossing was of importance; if it were destroyed the UN forces north and south of it would be separated and those on the north cut off from their source of supply. Hill 698 dominated this bridge from the west, as did Hill 534 from the east. These two hills were critical terrain features. Early on 1 November the 7th Marines boarded trucks at its Hamhung assembly area and, together with its attached artillery, the 2nd Battalion, 11th Marines, it moved north by road to defensive positions behind the ROK 26th Regiment, below Chosin Power Plant 3. The ROK troops had fallen back more than since they first met the PVA. At 10:30 on 2 November, the 7th Marines relieved the ROK 26th Regiment in its position and the 1st Battalion, followed by the 2nd Battalion, attacked north. By noon it had confirmed that PVA troops opposed it, and during the day captured three of them one from the 370th Regiment and two from the 372nd. At 16:30 the 1st Battalion began to prepare night defensive positions about south of Sudong. The 2nd Battalion, nearly behind the 1st Battalion, meanwhile had engaged in a hard struggle for Hill 698 west of the road. behind the 2nd Battalion the Regimental headquarters and the 3rd Battalion were at the Majon-dong road fork. Shortly after midnight the PVA launched a co-ordinated attack, calculated to separate the 1st and 2nd Battalions from each other and from the regiment behind them. The PVA infantry cut in between the 1st and 2nd Battalions and almost overran the 4.2-inch mortar company in position along the road. Fighting was close and at grenade range for both battalions. In the course of the battle the PVA gained a position dominating the crucial bridge in the 2nd Battalion area. With the coming of daylight, Marine aircraft went into action, repeatedly attacking the Chinese and eventually forcing them from their roadblock positions. Sandbagged trucks successfully brought sixty-six wounded Marines through PVA small arms fire to the rear. During the day combined ground and air action killed about 700 PVA soldiers. Identification on the dead showed that nearly all of them were members of the 370th Regiment. After the heavy battle on the 3rd, the PVA apparently withdrew, for the Marines encountered only light opposition on the 4th as they entered and passed through Sudong and continued on to the higher ground around Chinhung-ni. At Samgo railroad station, just north of Chinhung-ni, the Marines destroyed the last four tanks of the KPA 344th Tank Regiment. Less than beyond Chinhung-ni the steep climb began through the Funchilin Pass () to the Kot'o-ri plateau. The Marines could see enemy troops on the heights flanking the road at the pass. Farther north, according to aerial observers, an estimated 400 soldiers and three tanks were moving south from the Chosin Reservoir. Strafing reportedly caused heavy casualties in this column. A critical terrain feature, Hill 750, or How Hill as it came to be called, beyond Chinhung-ni, dominated the road where it made a hairpin loop of eastward in starting the climb. This hill was, in fact, the southern knob of a long finger ridge that extended southward from the rim of the Kot'o-ri plateau, on the east side of the road. On 5 November the 3rd Battalion moved through the 1st Battalion to start the attack up the pass. From How Hill the PVA stopped its advance. A map taken from a dead PVA officer showed that reinforced battalions on either side of the road were holding the high ground. Marine aircraft repeatedly attacked How Hill but failed to force the PVA from their positions. The Marines had to take How Hill before they could advance farther. The next day H Company made a long flanking march to approach the hill from the southeast. At 16:00 on 6 November, H Company reached the position from which it was to make its assault. After half an hour of air strikes and an artillery preparation, two platoons started for the top. Four times the PVA drove them back. When darkness fell the PVA still held the hill, and H Company withdrew. All night artillery and mortars pounded How Hill, the 81mm mortars firing 1,800 rounds. Meanwhile, west of the road a Marine force had seized Hill 611 without difficulty. A prisoner taken there supplied the second report X Corps had received that two more PVA units, the 125th and 126th Divisions, were in the reservoir area. The next morning, patrols from the 3rd Battalion found that the PVA had withdrawn from the heights behind Chinhung-ni, including How Hill leaving behind many dead and some wounded. Information gained later from prisoners disclosed that the artillery and mortar barrage against How Hill during the night had caused crippling casualties in the 372nd Regiment (possibly the 371st) of the 124th Division while it was moving up to reinforce the line. These losses had caused the CCF to withdraw. On the afternoon of 7 November the 3rd Battalion moved ahead and reached the village of Pohujang and Power Plant 1. During the Marines' six days of battle with the PVA 124th Division the 1st Marine Air Wing had inflicted great numbers of casualties on the Chinese. But according to prisoners, the supporting artillery and mortars had taken an even greater toll. After 7 November the PVA 124th Division reportedly was down to a strength of about 3,000 men. Except for its stragglers, the 124th Division did not again enter the fighting in the reservoir area. Thus far the action against the PVA 124th Division from 2 through 7 November had cost the 7th Marines 46 men killed, 262 wounded, and 6 missing in action. For two days after reaching Power Plant 1, the 7th Marines sent out patrols which failed to contact the PVA. On 10 November the regiment moved up over the pass without opposition and occupied Kot'o-ri. Only now separated it from Hagaru-ri. In its fight to reach the Kot'o-ri plateau the 7th Marines had captured 58 Chinese prisoners, 54 of them from the 124th Division and 4 from the 126th Division. It had taken its first prisoner from the 126th Division on 7 November. During this time a controversy between General Almond and General Partridge over the control of the 1st Marine Air Wing came to a head. Under existing procedure the Fifth Air Force Joint Operations Center at Seoul controlled the assignment of missions to the 1st Marine Air Wing. General Almond felt that, during a period of active ground combat when the local ground tactical situation could change drastically within an hour or two, he, the local commander, should have complete command over the air units supporting the ground troops. On 4 November General Partridge flew to Wonsan to hold a conference with General Almond on the subject. General Almond won his point; the Fifth Air Force ordered the 1st Marine Air Wing to assume direct responsibility for close support of X Corps without reference to the Joint Operations Center. Close support requests beyond the capabilities of the 1st Marine Air Wing were to be reported to the Fifth Air Force. On the Kot'o-ri plateau, during the afternoon and night of 10–11 November the temperature dropped 40 degrees to 8° below zero and with it came a wind of velocity. The weather later became colder, with the temperature dropping to from 20° to 25° below zero. During the succeeding three or four days more than 200 men of the regiment collapsed from severe cold and were placed in sick bays for medical treatment. Stimulants had to be used to accelerate depressed respiration. Water-soluble medicines froze, and morphine could be maintained in satisfactory condition only when kept against the body. Plasma could be used only after a 60- to 90-minute preparation in a warm tent. After the 7th Marines reached the Kot'o-ri plateau on 10 November, neither Colonel Litzenberg, the regimental commander, nor General Smith, the division commander, showed any inclination to hurry the advance. General Smith plainly indicated that he was apprehensive about his western exposed flank, that he wanted to improve the road up the pass from the division railhead at Chinhung-ni, that he wanted to develop a secure base at Hagaru-ri, and that he wanted to garrison key points on the main supply road back south and most of all he wanted to concentrate the full strength of the Marine division in the Hagaru-ri area before trying to advance further toward the Yalu. Winter struck early in the Chosin Reservoir area in 1950. It arrived with violent force and subzero temperatures on 10 November, the day the Marines reached the Kot'o-ri plateau. From that day on the troops there were involved in a winter campaign. Patrols sent out from Kot'o-ri on 11 and 12 November found only small scattered PVA groups in the hills, and the next day a Marine unit advanced to Pusong-ni, halfway to the reservoir. On 14 November the 7th Marines, wearing their heavy arctic parkas, trudged in subzero weather toward Hagaru-ri over a road now covered with an inch of snow. Vehicles froze up on the move and the men themselves had difficulty in moving forward. Entering Hagaru-ri, the Marines found it burned out by previous bombing attacks and practically deserted. Natives told them that the 3,000 PVA soldiers occupying the town had departed three days earlier, going north and west. A PVA soldier from the 377th Regiment, 126th Division, captured near Hagaru-ri during the day, said elements of his division were east of the reservoir. That night, 14–15 November, the temperature dropped to 15 degrees below zero. The next day the 7th Marines completed its movement into Hagaru- ri, and Colonel Litzenberg made arrangements for a perimeter defense. The 1st Battalion protected the northwest approaches, the 2nd Battalion the southern and the 3rd Battalion the northeast approaches to the town. That same day the 2nd Battalion, 5th Marines, arrived at Kot'o-ri, beginning the concentration of the rest of the 1st Marine Division in the Chosin Reservoir area behind the 7th Marines. The 5th Marines now guarded the main supply route back to Hamhung. Two days after the first Marine units entered Hagaru-ri, General Smith and Maj. Gen. Field Harris, Commanding General, 1st Marine Air Wing, on 16 November looked over the ground there and selected the site for a C-47 airstrip. Smith felt that such an airstrip would be needed to supplement supply by road and for fast evacuation of casualties. Engineer troops began work on the airstrip on 19 November, and others continued work on improving the road up the pass from Chinhung-ni. The first trucks climbed through the pass to Hagaru-ri on the 18th. Smith held the Marine advance to Hagaru-ri while this work continued. Thus it was, that with virtually no PVA opposition, the Marines advanced at an average rate of only a mile a day between 10 and 23 November. But this caution on the part of General Smith in concentrating the division and his insistence on securing its supply lines and of establishing a base for further operations in the frigid, barren wastes of the Chosin Reservoir area were to prove the division's salvation in the weeks ahead. ===The gap between Eighth Army and X Corps=== By mid-November in northeast Korea, forces under X Corps command were far to the north, and in some places stood at the northern boundary of the country. In west and central North Korea the forces under Eighth Army command were far south of these latitudes. A line drawn due east from the Eighth Army front after the battle to hold the Ch'ongch'on River bridgehead in early November would cross the X Corps rear areas far behind the Corps front. Not only was the X Corps front far north of Eighth Army's, but it was also separated from it by a wide lateral gap. Virtually all of North Korea west or northwest of the X Corps front in November was in KPA/PVA hands. This great gap, seldom penetrated even by army or corps patrols, extended a minimum distance of from the northernmost right flank positions of Eighth Army to the nearest left flank positions of X Corps. Farther south the gap was greater, being about on a line east of Pyongyang and west of Wonsan. This was the distance after the Korean Marine Corps 3rd Battalion established its blocking position at Tongyang on 14 November; before that the distance was about when the X Corps' westernmost position was at Majon-ni. The road-mile distances of this gap over exceedingly bad mountain trails, they hardly could be called roads, were far greater. Accordingly, physical contact between the two commands would have to be made in the southern part of the X Corps zone if it was to be accomplished at all. This wide gap between the two major tactical organizations of the UN Command in Korea caused great concern to Eighth Army and some to the Joint Chiefs of Staff in Washington; but less concern in X Corps, and very little, apparently, to General MacArthur. He believed that the mountainous backbone of North Korea was so destitute of roads and usable means of communication that it would be impossible for the UN forces to maintain a continuous line across the peninsula that far north, and that the enemy would be unable to use this mountainous spine for effective military operations. Indeed, it seems quite clear that it was principally because of this forbidding terrain and the lack of lateral communications between the western and eastern parts of North Korea that General MacArthur established the two separate commands in North Korea. While General MacArthur never expected solid and continuous physical contact between Eighth Army and X Corps in North Korea, he did expect communication and coordination between them by radio and personal liaison to the extent possible. There was radio communication between the two commands, and there was a daily trip by air of a liaison officer from X Corps to Eighth Army and back. As early as 25 October, before X Corps troops had landed on the east coast, arrangements had been made by the Fifth Air Force Joint Operations Center for two reconnaissance flights daily between ROK II Corps right flank and X Corps left flank, which were to report on front lines and enemy concentrations. The two commands made many attempts to establish physical contact between them by means of patrols scheduled to meet at designated points along the Eighth Army-X Corps boundary. The first of these efforts was made on 6 November when the 2nd Infantry Division of Eighth Army sent a reinforced patrol from K Company, 23rd Infantry Regiment, to the designated point (the village of Songsin-ni) on the boundary east of Yangdok. The patrol reached this point the next day but there were no elements of the X Corps there to meet it. At Yangdok the patrol found and destroyed 16 boxcars of 120mm, 80mm and 47mm ammunition; 6 self-propelled guns; 16 47mm antitank guns; 30 57mm antitank guns; 1 120mm mortar; 3 heavy machine guns; and 3 antitank rifles. X Corps sent a radio message to Eighth Army saying that Marines from the 3rd Battalion, 1st Marines, at Majon-ni, to the east, could not meet the Eighth Army patrol because of the distance and intensive guerrilla action in the area to be traversed. It suggested other contact points on roads to the north at Hadongsan-ni and at Sach'ang-ni. Upon receiving this message Eighth Army withdrew the 23rd Infantry patrol and prepared to send another one from the 38th Infantry Regiment, 2nd Division, to Hadongsan-ni on the next lateral road northward. General Almond meanwhile had ordered Colonel Harris, commanding officer of the 65th Infantry Regiment, 3rd Division, to place one battalion near the boundary to establish contact there with elements of Eighth Army. For this purpose the 1st Battalion, 65th Infantry Regiment, on 10 November after some delay rolled west and established its patrol base at Kwangch'on, about from the boundary, but double that in road miles. On 9 November IX Corps had ordered the 38th Infantry to send a patrol to Hadongsan- ni. But the patrol of the 2nd Reconnaissance Company which tried to reach that point was turned back by craters and boulders in the road. The next day patrols discovered all roads leading east from the 38th Infantry area were cratered or blocked by boulders. From the X Corps zone a patrol of the 65th Infantry went to the boundary on 11 November, and the next day it went beyond its boundary without meeting a patrol from Eighth Army. On the 12th the pilot of a liaison plane working with the patrol discovered a ROK force westward and dropped a message to it arranging a meeting for the next day. On the 13th, however, even though it went beyond the boundary to a point where the road became impassable, the 65th Infantry patrol failed to meet an Eighth Army patrol. Eighth Army had tried to keep the rendezvous at Hadongsan-ni, but its strong motorized patrol built around E Company, 38th Infantry, was stopped by road craters east of Maengsan. All the mountain roads and trails leading eastward from this area were examined by 38th Infantry patrols but none were found that would permit passage of motorized vehicles. Some of the craters were about deep and in diameter. Although work was started on a bypass it appears that it was never completed. While the 38th Infantry patrol failed to get through to the contact point on the 14th, on the 13th an Eighth Army liaison plane dropped two messages to the X Corps patrol saying that a patrol from the 10th Regiment, ROK 8th Division, was working its way to the contact point along a different route. On 14 November at 10:00 the two patrols, a platoon from the 2nd Battalion, 10th Regiment, ROK 8th Division, and a patrol from the 1st Battalion, 65th Infantry, did meet near the village of Songha- dong just west of the boundary. The ROK patrol had come on foot from its patrol base at Maengsan, to the west. En route it had encountered an estimated total of 400 KPA guerrillas and had fought several minor engagements. The round trip of the ROK patrol to the boundary and back to its base took ten days. This should explain why there were not daily meetings between Eighth Army and X Corps patrols at the boundary contact point. On 18 November, just before noon, a patrol from the 3rd Battalion, 38th Infantry, reportedly reached Hadongsan-ni on the boundary where it found a blown bridge which it could not bypass. There were no patrols there at that time from the 65th Infantry in the X Corps zone. Only once, therefore, on 14 November, did patrols from the Eighth Army (ROK II Corps) and the X Corps make physical contact with each other at the army-corps boundary. ===The Home by Christmas offensive (24–25 November)=== ====Planning==== Korean front line 23 November 1950 On 6 November, General MacArthur took official notice of the recent PVA offensive and summed up his estimate of the changing situation in Korea. He said the defeat of the North Koreans had been decisive when the Chinese intervened in \\"one of the most offensive acts of international lawlessness of historic record.\\" He said the possible trap \\"surreptitiously laid calculated to encompass the destruction of the United Nations Forces\\" was avoided, \\"with minimum losses only by the timely detection and skillful maneuvering of the United States commander responsible for that sector.\\" General MacArthur announced his future intentions: \\"Our present mission is limited to the destruction of those forces now arrayed against us in North Korea with a view to achieving the United Nations' objective to bring unity and peace to the Korean nation and its people.\\" He intended, obviously, to destroy the Chinese forces in Korea as well as the remaining North Koreans. To accomplish this he considered it necessary to establish an integrated continuous front in western and central Korea for co-ordinated large-scale offensive action. On that day General Walker issued Eighth Army's operation plan for a renewal of the offensive. It called for an advance to the Korean border with three Corps abreast, US I Corps on the west, US IX Corps in the center and ROK II Corps on the east in the army zone. With the withdrawal of the PVA from contact both in the west and northeast Korea about 7 November, confidence had reasserted itself in both Eighth Army and X Corps and X Corps on 11 November reiterated its directive to proceed to the Yalu. Both Eighth Army and X Corps were still enjoined under General MacArthur's directive of 24 October to proceed to the Yalu. On 15 November MacArthur instructed Almond to open an attack to the west after his inland flank forces reached the town of Changjin, north of the Chosin Reservoir. west of Changjin lay Kanggye and a junction with the arterial road and rail line connecting Manp'ojin and Huich'on. The road and track obviously served as enemy supply routes, and it was MacArthur's intention that the X Corps' westward attack would cut them. Apprehensive that the supply line of the attack force would become precariously extended in any drive westward from a point as far north as Changjin town, Almond offered the alternative of an attack over the road leading into the Eighth Army zone from Yudam-ni () at the western edge of the Chosin Reservoir. The enemy supply routes were to be cut at the village of Mup'yŏng-ni, west of Yudam-ni and north of Huich'on. Almond intended that the 1st Marine Division make the westward effort into Mup'yŏng-ni and then press an attack northwestward to the Yalu, pinching out in the process ROK II Corps on the Eighth Army right. MacArthur agreed to the change and instructed Almond to begin the attack as soon as possible. Almond set the 27th as the opening date. The 7th Division meanwhile was to expand its zone westward, placing forces on the east side of the Chosin Reservoir for an advance to the Yalu through the zone previously assigned to the Marines. ROK I Corps was to continue to the border from Hapsu and Ch'ongjin while Almond's remaining major units, the US 3rd Division and 1st Korean Marine Corps Regiment, secured the Corps' rear area between Wonsan and Hungnam. In accordance with Eighth Army's operational plan, the Joint Operations Center arranged 120 sorties for the Eighth Army's opening advance, these and others that might be requested during the day to be flown by the Fifth Air Force squadrons based in western Korea. General Partridge allotted the Fifth Air Force and Marine squadrons in northeastern Korea to the support of the X Corps. The Navy squadrons aboard the and meanwhile were to fly interdiction missions in the Eighth Army zone. As planned, Task Force 77 and Far East Air Forces' Bomber Command were to strike bridges and lines of communications within a strip along the Yalu River. This interdiction would in effect extend the air campaign launched earlier by General MacArthur against the Yalu bridges and North Korean supply and communications centers. The bombing attacks on the Yalu River crossings had already knocked down spans of the highway bridge at Sinuiju and two bridges at Hyesanjin, and incendiary strikes against North Korean towns had destroyed between 20 and 95 percent of the built-up areas. It was MacArthur's appraisal that this effort had \\"successfully interdicted enemy lines of support from the north so that further reinforcement therefrom has been sharply curtailed and essential supplies markedly limited.\\" ====The opposing forces==== On the afternoon of 21 November, Eighth Army advised I and IX Corps and the ROK that H-hour for the army attack was 10:00 24 November. Word of the attack hour had reached the front-line units by 23 November. The army front was generally quiet. Patrols went out several thousand yards in front of the line with little PVA/KPA contact. Nearly everywhere the PVA/KPA seemed to have withdrawn during the past week, leaving behind light outpost and covering positions. At no place did UN forces uncover what could be considered a main line of resistance. At the start of the offensive UN ground forces numbered 423,000 while it was estimated that the KPA strength was approximately 97,000 and the PVA strength approximately 70,000. In fact PVA strength at this point was approximately 300,000 as the interdiction of supply routes had failed to prevent the buildup of PVA forces. By 23 November the UN Command acknowledged the presence of twelve Chinese infantry divisions when in fact there were nine armies with thirty infantry divisions. On 23 November, the PVA VIII Army Group's six armies were located north of the Eighth Army front. The 50th and 66th Armies stood opposite I Corps in the west; the 39th and 40th Armies were centrally located north of IX Corps; the 38th and 42nd Armies were above ROK II Corps in the east. The 42nd Army earlier had opposed X Corps forces below the Chosin Reservoir but had shifted west into the Eighth Army zone after being relieved by the 20th Army of the IX Army Group. The latter group, also deployed with major units assembled behind screening forces, was now located above and west of the reservoir. 20th Army was deployed to the west and south of Yudam-ni, in the path of the X Corps' coming westward drive and had assembled the 26th and 27th Armies in the mountains to the north and northeast of the reservoir. This arrangement of forces followed a long-existing Chinese concept of mobile defense designed for operations against a superior force. Aimed not to hold ground but to destroy opposing forces in brief actions, the underlying strategy was to invite attack; fight a delaying action while allowing the attack force to penetrate deep; then, at a point of Chinese choice, counterattack suddenly while the opposing force was ill-prepared to receive the assault. It was because the Chinese deployed major forces well behind screening units that Eighth Army patrols and X Corps assault forces had encountered only outposts after mid-November. Showing little awareness of their adversary's doctrine, however, UNC officials had assumed from the light contact that the PVA had withdrawn into position defenses far to the north, and they had interpreted the deep, voluntary withdrawal as further indication that the PVA were weak in numbers. With unwarranted optimism, then, Eighth Army and X Corps started forward on 24 November, believing that they comfortably outnumbered enemy forces and expecting to encounter these in defensive positions that their weakness, and perhaps their mission, had forced them to establish. While General Walker fully expected the Eighth Army to encounter Chinese when it moved north, the lack of revealing contact in his zone left him uncertain about the location of PVA/KPA positions. From a study of aerial reconnaissance and prisoner of war interrogations, his Intelligence Officer (G-2), Lt. Col. James C. Tarkenton, traced two possible PVA/KPA defense lines. The nearer line curved from Chongju northeast through T’aech’on and Unsan above the western half of the army front, then extended almost due east into the mountains roughly above the eastern segment of the front. The second line started at Sonch’on, beyond Chongju, and ran northeast through Kusong, Onjong and Huich’on and into the Taebaeks as far as the northern end of the Chosin Reservoir. Colonel Tarkenton estimated that the Eighth Army would meet some 48,000 PVA and several KPA units defending important road centers along these lines. Walker distributed assault forces evenly for the advance toward the suspected lines. In the west, I Corps comprised the 24th Infantry Division, the ROK 1st Division, and the 27th Commonwealth Brigade. At center, IX Corps included the 25th Infantry Division, the 2nd Infantry Division, and the brigade-size 1st Turkish Armed Forces Command, which had not yet seen combat in Korea. ROK II Corps, on the east, would operate with the ROK 6th, 7th and 8th Divisions. The 1st Cavalry Division and the British 29th Independent Infantry Brigade were Walker's immediate reserves. While in reserve the cavalry were to protect forward army supply points at Kunu-ri, located just below the Ch’ongch’on River in the IX Corps area, and at Sukch’on, south of the river on Route 1 behind I Corps. The British brigade, a recent arrival in Korea, was currently far to the south assembling temporarily at Kaesong, north of Seoul. Eighth Army units with no assignment in the attack included the 187th Airborne Regimental Combat Team and the Philippines 10th Battalion Combat Team, which were guarding supply installations in the Pyongyang-Chinnamp’o area, and ROK III Corps with four recently activated or reactivated ROK divisions (the 2nd, 5th, 9th and 11th) which was operating against guerrillas in central and southern Korea. The Thai Battalion had just finished processing at the UN Reception Center and was en route to Pyongyang on the eve of the advance. Replacing the Thais at the reception center was the Netherlands Battalion, which had reached Korea on 23 November and was to receive two weeks’ training before joining operations. ====Offensive==== On the morning of 24 November I Corps commander General Milburn sent his two divisions west and northwest toward Chongju and T’aech’on, holding his British brigade in reserve. IX Corps commander General Coulter, kept the Turkish brigade in reserve at Kunu-ri, sent one division north astride the Kuryong River toward Unsan and Onjong, and moved his other division up the Ch’ongch’on valley in the direction of Huich’on. On the army right, Maj. Gen. Yu Hae Ueng, the ROK II Corps commander, started two of his three divisions north through the mountains toward terrain objectives aligned with those of Coulter's forces. At the I Corps left, Maj. Gen. Church's 24th Division led off with a regimental attack over Route 1, its 21st Infantry and a company of tanks moving westward toward Chongju, away. On the Corps' right, two regiments of Maj. Gen. Paik Sun Yup's ROK 1st Division supported by a company of American tanks advanced on T’aech’on, moving upstream on both sides of the Taeryong River over secondary roads that converged on the objective northwest. The 21st Infantry Regiment marched more than halfway to Chongju during the day, receiving only a little long-range small arms fire from the hills north of Route 1 as it moved. Two platoons of PVA infantry and a ditch that delayed the tanks were the only opposition to General Paik's forces, who established night defenses within of T’aech’on. In the left half of the IX Corps zone, the 25th Division, commanded by Maj. Gen. William B. Kean, moved north astride the Kuryong River toward Unsan with two regiments and an armored force, Task Force Dolvin. The 35th and 24th Infantry Regiments on left and right, respectively, advanced unopposed, while Task Force Dolvin in the middle moved along the east bank of the Kuryong, receiving only small arms fire as it covered the last mile. southeast of Unsan Task Force Dolvin recovered thirty members of the 8th Cavalry Regiment who had been captured in the Battle of Unsan in early November and then released by the PVA. Most were wounded and frostbitten. Maj. Gen. Laurence B. Keiser's 2nd Infantry Division, at the IX Corps' right, sought no sweeping first-day gains since it was already ahead of the 25th Division. Rather than risk an open west flank, General Keiser ordered short moves by his line regiments, the 9th and 38th, to mass along the lower bank of the Paengnyong River, a westward flowing tributary of the Ch’ongch’on. In the ROK II Corps zone, gains by the ROK 7th and 8th Divisions ranged from but none at all against two PVA/KPA battalions dug in near the boundary between them. In one of the deeper gains, the ROK 3rd Regiment, 7th Division at the Corps' left came up to the Paengnyong River and tied in with the 38th Infantry of the 2nd Division. General MacArthur, other senior commanders and several chiefs of US press bureaus in Tokyo, had flown to Korea on the morning of the 24th to witness the beginning of the attack. General Walker joined them in visits to I Corps, IX Corps and 24th Division headquarters along the Ch'ongch'on. At I Corps headquarters General Milburn cast a momentary shadow over the bright picture being drawn when he told the party that his patrols had found the Unsan area heavily defended, and in his opinion the projected IX Corps attack there would not progress easily. General Church briefed the party at the 24th Division headquarters shortly after noon on the progress of the attack. Optimism and enthusiasm as to chances of the attack succeeding seemed to prevail. Chongju and T’aech’on remained the immediate I Corps objectives on 25 November. Chongju, previously tagged as a probable center of PVA/KPA resistance, was empty when the 21st Infantry entered in midafternoon. In preparation for widening the 24th Division's advance, General Church meanwhile moved the 19th Infantry out on Route 1 to Napch’ongjong (), before Chongju. The ROK 1st Division, on the other hand, had found during the night that T’aech’on would be harder to take when PVA supported by artillery and mortar fire counterattacked along the east bank of the Taeryong and forced part of General Paik's right regiment to the rear. Although the PVA lifted their attack after daylight, they allowed the ROK only to restore and improve slightly their previous position. Paik's forces west of the Taeryong held themselves to a small advance while those on the east regained lost ground. The division was still short of T’aech’on at dark on the 25th. Encountering no organized PVA/KPA positions but receiving considerable long-range small arms, machine gun, and mortar fire, the two IX Corps divisions gained on the 25th. At that rate the 25th Division astride the Kuryong on the Corps left was easily within a day's advance of Unsan. On the Corps' right, the 9th Infantry Regiment, 2nd Division moved up the Ch’ongch’on valley, closing into positions split by the Ch’ongch’on with the bulk of the regiment on the west side of the river. The 38th Infantry meanwhile stayed at the Paengnyong except for patrols that searched above the river to cover the 9th's east flank. ROK II Corps advanced against opposition that varied in much the same pattern as on the previous day. The Corps' center continued to be a trouble spot, and at the far right, to the rear of the ROK front, an enemy force tested the 16th Regiment, 8th Division protecting the Corps' and Eighth Army east flank from positions some east of the village of Yongdong-ni (). The force, presumably PVA and possibly a reconnaissance unit since it was reported to include a hundred horse cavalrymen, struck the easternmost battalion of the 16th and lifted its attack only after forcing the ROK to withdraw . Although the second day of advance had produced heavier PVA/KPA fire and local counterattacks, General Walker's forces had little reason to lose enthusiasm for their renewed offensive. All divisions had gained ground. In the I Corps zone, the 24th Division, having occupied Chongju, was on the Eighth Army's first phase line, and the ROK 1st Division was close to it. In the IX Corps zone, the 25th Division was not far from Unsan and the 2nd Division had made progress in the Ch’ongch’on valley. Despite rougher going in the Taebaek ridges farther east, ROK II Corps also had pushed forward. Casualties had not been heavy in any of the Corps' zones. The advance, moreover, was soon to be reinforced by X Corps’ attack from the east. Walker issued a single order on the 25th, one that shortened the final objective line of ROK II Corps to conform with the 27 November attack by General Almond's forces. Otherwise, he intended that the Eighth Army would continue its advance on the 26th as originally conceived. The Eighth Army's optimism still hinged on the assumption that the Chinese had not tapped their large Manchurian reserve for offensive operations in Korea. Although the final army intelligence report on 25 November showed an increase in PVA forces opposing the advance, the new figure stood at only 54,000, just 6,000 more than the pre-attack estimate. In reviewing possible PVA/KPA actions, Colonel Tarkenton added only that he now expected PVA/KPA forces to employ local counterattacks in conjunction with their defense. ==Aftermath== On 24 October, when Eighth Army troops crossed the Ch'ongch'on River and the ROK 6th Division passed through Huich'on and headed for the Yalu, less than six weeks had passed since that army had battled desperately at the Pusan Perimeter. Since then, the Eighth Army, moving up from the south had penetrated into North Korea. In doing this it had overrun Pyongyang and breached the last important river barrier south of the northern border of the country. These attacks had virtually destroyed the KPA. By the end of the first week of November, it was clear that Chinese forces had intervened in the war. This intervention, long feared and by some expected, had become a fact. The intervention came in sufficient force to drive the Eighth Army back to the Ch'ongch'on River and to delay the advance of X Corps in the east toward the Chosin Reservoir. After accomplishing this, the PVA withdrew from immediate contact with Eighth Army behind a screen of KPA forces. In the two weeks after the Chinese broke off their offensive and withdrew from contact with Eighth Army, the impact of the Chinese intervention on the American command gradually subsided. Among Eighth Army staff members, the motive generally ascribed for the intervention was that the Chinese wanted to protect the power plants south of the Yalu River. Many now thought they would dig in on a defensive line to do this. As the days passed and the front remained quiet, fear of massive Chinese intervention dwindled. On 22 November, X Corps intelligence reported that the PVA was \\"apparently preparing to make a defensive stand in his present positions,\\" and that there was \\"no evidence to indicate any considerable number of [PVA] units have crossed the border since the initial reinforcement.\\" Against this optimistic assessment the UN Command launched its \\"Home by Christmas\\" Offensive intended to complete the conquest of North Korea. On 25 November the PVA launched their Second Phase Offensive with the Battle of the Ch'ongch'on River against Eighth Army and the Battle of Chosin Reservoir against X Corps. By the end of December, these and subsequent PVA/KPA attacks had forced the UN forces to retreat below the 38th Parallel. ==See also== *UN September 1950 counteroffensive *Second Phase Offensive == References == Category:Conflicts in 1950 Category:1950 in Korea Category:Battles of the Korean War Category:Battles involving North Korea Category:Battles involving South Korea Category:Battles of the Korean War involving Australia Category:Battles of the Korean War involving China Category:Battles of the Korean War involving the United Kingdom Category:Battles of the Korean War involving the United States ","title":"UN offensive into North Korea"},{"id":"60350161","text":"Kesari Nandan is an Indian social drama television series that aired on Colors TV from 1 January to 26 July 2019.

Smith-Gobat, along with climbing partner Libby Sauter, completed the climb in October, 2014. Other notable ascents include her 2012 first female ascent (FFA) of Punks in the Gym (5.14a) in the Arapiles climbing region of Australia, and the first all female Half Dome/El Cap link up in Yosemite in 2013. == Early Life == Smith-Gobat is from Christchurch, New Zealand. Although she became interested in alpine and sport climbing around Mount Cook as a teenager, her focus turned to alpine skiing for several years. In 2000, she was competing in extreme skiing competitions and ranked as the best female extreme skier in New Zealand. Smith-Gobat recalls that \\"when I left school I became side-tracked by skiing - I followed winters around the world and barely climbed for a couple of years... until a skiing accident turned my attention back to climbing\\" at the age of 21. Smith-Gobat had been skiing in Breckenridge, Colorado at the time of the accident, a run-in with a pine tree. The collision broke a heel in one leg and ankle in the other, and left her with a temporarily wired-shut jaw and six months of crutches. Grounded from skiing, Smith-Gobat turned to climbing as an outlet for her energies. == Climbing Achievements == After recovery from her accident, Smith-Gobat began racking up a string of sport climbing and bouldering accomplishments. Starting in 2002, Smith-Gobat made FFAs of many New Zealand-based bouldering routes and won the New Zealand National Bouldering Series in 2002, 2003 and 2004, and the Christchurch Indoor Bouldering Series in 2005. By 2007 she was climbing up to 8b+ (V10/5.14a) level routes, including a first ascent Heaven/ Little Babylon (8b/8b+) in Milford, NZ. By the late 2000s, Smith-Gobat was one of the leading climbers from New Zealand, male or female, as the first New Zealander to complete an 8c level climb, with L’academicien in Ceuse, France. === Salathé Wall === By 2009, Smith-Gobat was climbing in Yosemite and interested in taking on big-wall challenges. The Salathé Wall is a classic route up El Capitan in Yosemite Valley. At approximately 3500ft and 35-pitches, it is also one of the longest routes, known for its difficult, off-width crack sections. A single female climber, Steph Davis, had previously free climbed Salathé. Smith-Gobat spent the summer of 2010 working out the beta for the crux sections before making a ground-up attempt. Unfortunately, a five-day rain storm hit while she was in the upper reaches of the climb, forcing her to bail out. In 2011, Smith-Gobat returned and, in a six day final push, managed to complete the remaining pitches, becoming only the second woman to do so. Later, she described the experience as \\"900m of air under my feet and only one single flared crack splitting the sheer overhung granite wall. It felt so good.\\" === Speed Climbing The Nose=== Smith-Gobat became interested in attempting to break the women's record for climbing speed on The Nose after hearing how slow the old one was. \\"I first started thinking about doing it when the women’s record was 12 hours, basically because I felt that this was almost an embarrassment to us.\\" In 2012, she and partner Chantel Astorga set a new record with a seven hour and 26 minute climb of The Nose. They then linked to Half Dome, becoming the first all female team to complete the linked climb in under 24 hours (at 20h:09m). Smith-Gobat also broke the mixed-gender record for The Nose, finishing it in three hours and 29 minutes with partner Sean Leary. By the end of 2012, between Salathé, a FFA of Australia's iconic Punks in the Gym (8b+) in October, 2012 and the Yosemite speed records, Planet Mountain would describe Smith-Gobat as \\"certainly one of the world's leading rock climbers.\\" In 2014, with partner Libby Sauter, Smith-Gobat would set a new women's record, four hours and forty three minutes. The women made several attempts that season, improving in speed each time. Smith-Gobat noted that they had to work both on developing trust and communication and to learn a different style of climbing that emphasized speed over safety. The team decreased the number of bolts, increasing the height of any potential fall. On easier sections, the climbers simul-climbed, a higher-risk climbing technique, while on harder sections, they employed a short-fixing style. Smith-Gobat described the technique they used to increase speed as \\"pretty risky...if I fall off, I'm hopefully not going to die, but I'm going to fall a hell of a long way before I hit the end of that rope.\\" She noted that \\"the main difference between us and the guys who are climbing it in 2:30, is that they simulclimb more of the upper half of the route, where we are short-fixing more to keep it within the safety margin we are happy with.\\" ===Riders on the Storm === ==== 2016 Attempt ==== By 2016, Smith-Gobat had turned her focus towards making the first free ascent of Riders on the Storm, a massive 1300m (4265ft) route up the east face of Torre Central in Torres del Paine, Patagonia. The region surrounding Torre Central is notorious for fickle weather and poor conditions. Several key pitches are nearly always encased in ice, and the route, crusted with unstable rock, requires strength in a variety of styles, including crack, roof and face. Wolfgang Güllich and Kurt Albert put up Riders on the Storm over the winter of 1990/1991 using a mixed aid climbing technique. The original climbers were able to free climb pitches up to 7c (5.12d) and aid climb to A3. While the first free ascent of Riders is considered a \\"plum objective throughout the big wall climbing world,\\" according to PlanetMountain , the region's notoriously bad weather and the allure of more popular routes nearby at Fitz Roy and Cerro Torre, limited the number of attempts. Up to 2016, three teams successfully reached the summit following Riders on the Storm, none making a free ascent. Over the course of 15 days in January and February 2016, Smith-Gobat, climbing partner Ines Papert and photographer Thomas Senf broached the climb. The climbers began with a rare stretch of good weather, and were able to establish a five-pitch free climbing variant to avoid a section that had previously only been possible with aid climbing. They also succeeded at free climbing two previously unconquered upper pitches and became the fifth team to reach the summit on February 6th. The duo endured numb hands and feet and near-miss rockfalls. At one point, they developed an innovative, but disconcerting, technique to deal with the ice, wearing a climbing shoe on one foot and an ice boot with crampons on the other. After summit day, with deteriorating weather and 110mph winds in the forecast, the team resolved to try to complete the remaining four pitches they had yet to free climb. Early on in the attempt, they were delayed for several hours when they found that their cached ropes and equipment had been buried under an avalanche and needed to be dug out. During the ascent, the predicted high winds hit, and after struggling to reach the portaledge, they decided to descend. Continuing bad weather ended the trip without the first free ascent, although they achieved the summit and free climbed several new sections, extending the difficulty level to 7c+ (5.13a). The women had several near misses, surviving a rock fall into their portaledge and another that split Papert's helmet, and a nearly spliced rope. While Smith-Gobat wanted to give the route another try, Papert decided to forgo a second attempt, saying \\"I have had a lot of luck on the wall. Even though the prospect of coming back is very tempting, I have decided the level of risk is not worth it.\\" ==== 2017 Attempt ==== Smith-Gobat recruited a new partner for the second attempt, up-and-coming climber Brette Harrington, who, at 25 years old, was making a name for herself with trad and free soloing accomplishments. Prior to her return, Smith-Gobat allowed that she wondered why so few others had successfully reached the summit. However, Torre Central presented a new face in 2017, one that made it clear exactly how difficult the task was going to be. \\"When Brette Harrington and I approached Torre Central our hearts sank: the lower slabs were covered in ice and ice snow, unrecognizable from last season.\\" The climbers struggled through the lower sections to reach the four remaining pitches. They had originally planned to free climb all the lower pitches as well, but given poor conditions, they resolved to get to the crux pitches any way they could. In 2016, it took Papert and Smith-Gobat two days to reach the crux, but nearly four weeks the second time. Each morning they would wake at 3am, hoping for a break in the weather, only to encounter punishingly high winds, ice covered slabs, and wet rock. In the end, they were only able to work on the crux pitches for two days out of the six week attempt. Afterwards, Smith-Gobat would write of the experience \\"all I wanted to do was leave and never come back. It felt as if we were forcing something that was not meant to be—like swimming against a strong current. I was exhausted ... deep down I knew that leaving would mean never returning to Riders on the Storm. In this moment I hated the place. Hated that it was forcing me to face the one thing that had always terrified me about climbing in Patagonia—to sit still in a tent and wait with nothing to do for weeks on end; to sit and watch all that hard-earned strength waste away, and to what end?\\" Despite falling short of the goal, Harrington and Smith-Gobat free climbed two of the four remaining pitches and felt that, even with the poor weather, they had been very close on a third. Harrington later wrote that she believed \\"the crux pitches could go,\\" setting up a possible return trip for the duo. However, as of 2019, both Harrington and Smith-Gobat were focusing on other goals, with no public plans for another attempt on Riders on the Storm. == References == Category:1979 births Category:New Zealand mountain climbers Category:Living people ","title":"Mayan Smith-Gobat"},{"id":"60350164","text":"Ulrich of Attems (Ulrich von Attems; 1082 in Attimis, Udine – 1170) was an Italian nobleman from the family of Attems. He also served as the imperial vicar of Tuscany and Spoleto between 1139 and 1152. Ulrich was the son Conrad of Attems (1052–1106), who was a Minister of King Conrad III, who regarded himself as the heir of Henry V. Therefore, Ulrich tried in 1128–1130 in opposition to the popes to seize the vast Italian properties of Matilda of Tuscany. In 1137, Henry X, Duke of Bavaria (Henry the Proud) of the Welf family was named the Margrave of Tuscany by Lothair II, Holy Roman Emperor. Shortly before the death of Henry in 1139, Ulrich was appointed by Conrad (who succeeded Lothair) as vicar there.von Freising, Otto, Chronica, lib. VII, chapter 23 This led to further conflicts between Konrad and the Welf family.Gebhardt, Bruno, Handbuch der deutschen Geschichte: Zwölftes Jahrhundert, 1125-1198, p. 67 Ulrich as vicar ruled over Tuscany and Spoleto until 1152. During his time in Tuscany, the Normans from the Kingdom of Sicily attacked and conquered northern Abruzzo (at that time part of the Duchy of Spoleto) in 1140. King Roger II of Sicily sent his son Alfonso of Capua supported by his eldest son Roger III, Duke of Apulia, across the border at Pescara which overwhelmed the defensive forces against them. The resulting territory up to the Tronto River was then incorporated into the Kingdom of Sicily.Matthew, Donald, The Norman Kingdom of Sicily, University of Cambridge Press (1992) pp.53-54 Subsequently, Ulrich had difficulty maintaining and consolidating his power in Tuscany. After the death of Conrad in 1152, another member of the Welf family, Welf VI was named the Margrave of Tuscany and Duke of the remainder of Spoleto by Frederick I. ==See also== * Duke of Spoleto * List of rulers of Tuscany * * Norman conquest of southern Italy ==References== Category:1082 births Category:1170 deaths Category:Italian nobility ","title":"Ulrich of Attems"},{"id":"60350167","text":"Sazhino () is a rural locality (a selo) in Dubovskoye Rural Settlement, Beryozovsky District, Perm Krai, Russia.

Cady. Her family was initially from Connecticut, but migrated to Columbia County in the middle of the eighteenth century. She was remembered by neighbors and family members as beautiful, strong-willed, and active; none remembered her artistic endeavors. Census records give her occupation as \\"housework\\". Cady remained unmarried throughout her life. After the deaths of her parents she moved in with a nephew; around 1920 she moved again, to Grass Lake, Michigan, where she lived with her sister and sister's family until dying. Cady's work is unusual, as theorem painting was long past its popularity when she began practicing the art. Her work was discovered in the 1930s by folk art collectors J. Stuart Halladay and Herrell George Thomas, who assumed that she was another person of the same name who lived in New Lebanon, New York around 1820, when theorem painting was at its most popular. Research performed in 1978 by Ruth Piwonka and Roderick H. Blackburn revealed her true identity. Four watercolors and one oil on canvas by the artist are known; two of the former are still-life depictions of glass compotes, while the other two are images of doves sitting on a branch. One of these, produced for her brother and sister-in-law on the birth of their eldest son in 1890, is her only signed and dated work. Cady was evidently a master of the theorem technique; besides using both transparent and opaque watercolor paints, she applied mica flecks to her depictions of glass and used a textured cloth to spread powder over her stencils, a technique known as \\"pouncing\\". Her works are considered among the finest examples of theorem painting known. She is one of the few theorem artists known to have signed her work. One of Cady's still-life paintings, Fruit in Glass Compote of c. 1895, is in the collection of the American Folk Art Museum, to which it was donated by Ralph Esmerian. A nearly identical piece, dated c. 1890, is owned by the Abby Aldrich Rockefeller Folk Art Museum. ==References== Category:1854 births Category:1933 deaths Category:American women painters Category:19th-century American painters Category:19th-century American women artists Category:People from Columbia County, New York Category:Painters from New York (state) ","title":"Emma Jane Cady"},{"id":"60350311","text":"Vasantha Kumar Hanumaiah Ranganatha (born 16 January 1994) is an Indian badminton player who currently plays in doubles category. ==Career== In 2018 he won the Ghana International.

With the release of her 1936 film El Gato montés (The Wildcat) she became one of Spain's women film pioneers, along with Elena Jordi and Helena Cortesina. She also directed Molinos de viento. Her Star Films Movie Company produced the first talkies in Spain. == Biography == Rosario was born in Barcelona in 1899 into a family that owned a textile factory in Sabadell. She walked with a limp from a young age (likely due to polio, according to historians). As a young woman, she forged a path for herself as an entrepreneur, starting her own lingerie business in Barcelona. When her business failed in 1929, she moved to Madrid and entered the fledgling film industry, forming a production company called Star Films. Star Films produced the first Spanish talkies. In 1935 she made her debut as director with El Gato Montés (The Wildcat), released in 1936, an adaptation of the Manuel Penella Moreno's operetta of the same name. After she moved back to Barcelona to direct her second feature film Molinos de viento in 1937, during the Spanish Civil War, her career as a filmmaker more or less ended, and she was forced into exile in Italy. Unfortunately, her film Molinos de viento, starring Maria Mercader, is lost. In Rome, she worked as Maria Mercader's agent, who soon became one of Cinecittà film studios stars. Some critics believe that Pi Brujas continued working in the film industry in Rome, and was the uncredited director of the film Forza bruta (1940). For Magí Crusells and Jordi Sebastian, back in Madrid, she run a restaurant and worked as a journalist under the pseudonym of Rizpay. For Martin-Márquez she instead got a job at the Casa Mabel, a fashion designer that produced costumes for the film industry and made Ana Mariscal's dresses. Ironically, Mariscal was the actress who, just a few years later, would take Rosario Pi's place as the sole woman filmmaker in Spain. == Selected filmography == === As producer === * ¡Yo quiero que me lleven a Hollywood!

Richard quits his job to pursue his compression application Pied Piper. The company initially starts out as a simple data compression platform, but when this, and a videochat that Dinesh created with the algorithm fails, Richard pivots toward creating a new, decentralized internet, called PiperNet. For the most part, Richard is shy and weak-willed, and does not have much of a temper, but when he finally reaches his limit, is prone to intimidating explosions of anger. Richard is constantly struggling with the demands of the business world, preferring instead to disappear into the coding of his application, but realizes that as CEO he must do more. Throughout most of the series, Richard is determined to make Pied Piper a company different from the dreary Hooli and the condescending, aloof Gavin Belson, but as the series progresses, it becomes clear that the many trials and tribulations of trying to get his business to succeed have made him cynical, narcissistic and unappeasable, in much the same vein as the man from whom he once sought to distinguish himself. This is exemplified in the season 5 premiere, wherein Richard uses Gavin's tactic of spending large amounts of company money and resources to bankrupt two weaker, recently merged companies, ostensibly to acquire their coders, but in reality to get petty vengeance on the two CEOs, who had tried to screw him over. Richard has also grown more aggressive and outspoken toward his friends, even insulting Gilfoyle without fear. However, Richard has also grown more competent and prideful in business by season 5, effectively using Gavin's ego to stall his 51% attack on Pied Piper and gain back 51% of the company, allowing Richard to finally release PiperNet the way he wants it without more interference. In season 6, Richard once again struggles between executing business tactics and not compromising his own moral values. He proclaims in front of the United States Senate that Pied Piper will not collect user data and the implementation of a decentralized internet will prevent such actions from taking place, but soon finds that one of Pied Piper's developers, Collin, is actively mining user data. He attempts to blackmail Collin by using APIs to collect his phone calls, but the plan backfires when Collin shows off the technology to interested investors. Collin would later join Chilean billionaire Maximo Reyes's alliance with YaoNet, Pied Piper's main competitor after Richard turned down an offer from Reyes to purchase a $1 billion stake in Pied Piper because Richard refused to collect user data. Pied Piper is able to fend off YaoNet when they purchase the cash-striped Hooli by going around Gavin Belson and convinces his board to sign on. Later, Belson, forced into retirement, publishes a code of conduct known as \\"Tethics\\" for all major companies to sign on. Richard refused initially out of anger at Belson's blatant hypocrisy, but soon discovers that Belson had plagiarized from the mission statements of companies such as Applebee's and Starbucks. Richard then attempts to close a deal with AT&T; but was turned down initially. While running the internet service at Russ Hanneman's RussFest, Richard discovers YaoNet's presence at the festival. He and the team initially fend off YaoNet, but soon learns from Laurie Bream that YaoNet was only observing the performance of PiperNet and that it is not more advanced compared to YaoNet. Richard initially breaks down at the revelation, but later reverts the system with artificial intelligence, leading to success at RussFest and a $100 million deal with AT&T.; However, days before PiperNet's launch, Richard discovers that the network's AI has become so advanced that it can bypass advanced encryptions, meaning that it can potentially end privacy if implemented on a large scale. Although initially reluctant, Richard agrees to intentionally sabotage PiperNet in order to prevent the AI from potentially ending internet privacy. After PiperNet's launch caused thousands of rats to emerge onto streets all over the country, Richard shuts down Pied Piper in shame. He would later travel the world and is revealed to have become a \\"Gavin Belson Professor of Technology Ethics\\" at Stanford University ten years after the initial PiperNet launch. === Erlich Bachman === Erlich Bachman, portrayed by T.J. Miller (seasons 1–4), is an arrogant entrepreneur who founded an innovation incubator in his home after the purchase of his airfare collator Aviato. Erlich still holds on to his glory days in the valley, wearing Aviato T-shirts and driving a Ford Escape adorned with Aviato logos. Under the incubator agreement, Erlich owns 10% of Pied Piper, and is later appointed to the company's board of directors after Richard realizes how important Erlich is to the business. Erlich is a frequent user of marijuana. It is revealed in the season 2 finale that Erlich no longer codes because of severe carpal tunnel syndrome. Despite being relatively unsuccessful in his own entrepreneurial ventures, he is a charismatic public speaker and negotiator, and is often seen as the \\"face\\" of Pied Piper. In season 3 he begins to have a less active role in Pied Piper. He begins to start his own VC firm with Big Head but then declares bankruptcy. After selling his Pied Piper shares to cover his debts, he gets rehired into the company as a PR representative. When Richard starts his new company using the Pied Piper trademark, Erlich then owns 10% of the new company while keeping his PR job at the old company which is eventually deleted. Erlich then decides to focus on Jian-Yang's product which also fails. After another failed deal with Kenan Feldspar and quitting his job at Bream-Hall, Erlich then decides that he and Richard will never be successful and moves away to Tibet to join Gavin Belson at a monastery at the end of season 4. After Gavin was informed that Jack Barker was being held hostage, he immediately proceeds to take Erlich with him to leave Tibet. However, Erlich then becomes incubated upon consuming opium at an Inn, and Gavin pays the innkeeper enough money to take care of Erlich for five years. Erlich is never heard from again afterward, although Richard reveals in \\"Exit Event\\" that he tried to look for Erlich in Tibet. === Nelson \\"Big Head\\" Bighetti === Nelson \\"Big Head\\" Bighetti, portrayed by Josh Brener, is a former tenant of Erlich's incubator and Richard's best friend who also works at Hooli. He is unintelligent and naïve, but still manages to acquire significant influence as a result of the struggle between Hooli and Pied Piper. After work on Pied Piper commences, Big Head is offered a huge raise and promotion by Gavin Belson to help Hooli develop its copycat software, Nucleus, out of spite and because Richard was forced to limit his staff. He is continually promoted so rapidly that buzz develops about him, and he ends up on the cover of Wired magazine. He is later removed from the Nucleus project due to his lack of technical knowledge, and has absolutely no responsibilities at Hooli. He was later promoted further to make it appear that he was the actual creator of Pied Piper while working at Hooli, but he is unaware of this. After a disastrous binding arbitration with Pied Piper, Gavin makes Big Head redundant and pays him $20 million in severance, which he blows through very quickly when Erlich tricks him into entering into a business arrangement with him, naming their firm, \\"Bachmanity\\". Big Head then buys a majority stake in PiperChat following the sale of a technology blog he and Erlich owned. Due to his poor business skills, his father takes over control of his share on his behalf. In season 4, Big Head takes a position as a Computer Science instructor at Stanford University. In season 5, after discovering that he never formally severed his arrangement with Erlich, Big Head is legally Erlich's next-of-kin and gains ownership of Erlich's house and 10% ownership of Pied Piper from Jian-Yang. Big Head moves into Erlich's house but keeps in touch with Jian-Yang, allowing him to move back into the house after Jian-Yang loses everything in China. In season 6, Big Head continues to run the Hacker Hostel with Jian-Yang but is aloof to his unethical activities. After Jian-Yang refused to give Pied Piper the backdoor key of his algorithm, Big Head reveals that he has recited it and gives it to Richard. In the series finale \\"Exit Event\\", it is revealed that Big Head's father's stake has been bought by Russ Hanneman, although Big Head himself is unaware of it. Later, it is shown that ten years after PiperNet's launch, Big Head has become the President of Stanford University and has hired Richard to work as a \\"Gavin Belson Professor of Technology Ethics\\". === Bertram Gilfoyle === Bertram Gilfoyle, portrayed by Martin Starr, is a LaVeyan Satanist network engineer and system architect. Initially an undocumented immigrant from Canada, Gilfoyle successfully applied for a visa after being pressured by Dinesh. Gilfoyle credits himself as an online security expert, and as such is responsible for system administration and server configuration at Pied Piper. Gilfoyle has a girlfriend Tara (Milana Vayntrub) who is also a LaVeyan Satanist, with the two having an open and long-standing relationship, though Tara still lies to Gilfoyle about sleeping with other men. Gilfoyle often plays mocking pranks on Dinesh, but the two do appear to be friends or at most, frenemies despite this, with the two often bonding over their shared moral ambiguity. While he is usually indifferent to Richard and lacks loyalty toward him, Gilfoyle highly respects Richard as a coder and admits that Pied Piper is nothing without Richard. Like Dinesh, Gilfoyle is quick-witted and merciless, but in contrast, highly apathetic, sardonic and brutally honest. He acts as the systems architect of Pied Piper. Gilfoyle is very confident in his abilities and has proven his worth to the Pied Piper team on multiple occasions, such as building the server farm \\"Anton\\", to save the company the struggle of paying for generic, mediocre servers in an office space. Due to this, Gilfoyle takes great pride in his security tech, becoming very nervous and confused whenever his tech is compromised. In season 5, Gilfoyle is promoted to senior management along with Dinesh with the title of \\"Chief Systems Architect\\". By Season 6, Gilfoyle is promoted to VP of Architecture at Pied Piper but refuses to take anyone under his management, preferring to work on the Systems Architecture by himself. This leads to continual conflict with Head of HR Tracy Robertson. After Pied Piper was shut down, Gilfoyle and Dinesh began to run a large cybersecurity firm together and also live next to each other. === Dinesh Chugtai === Dinesh Chugtai, portrayed by Kumail Nanjiani, is a talented programmer specializing in Java originally from Karachi, Pakistan who is typically the victim of Gilfoyle's embarrassing games and pranks. Dinesh exhibits a quick-witted and merciless temperament toward everyone on the team, and often behaves in a deceitful and unhelpful manner, such as when he plots the death of a man who was dating the girl that he liked. Dinesh is also shown to be especially materialistic and uncomfortable with women. Dinesh always seems to run into bad luck, such as getting involved with cyber criminals to opportunities for recognition. Like Gilfoyle, Dinesh usually lacks loyalty to Richard, exemplified in season 4, when Dinesh was briefly CEO of PiperChat, he refused to give Richard algorithm usage data in exchange for use of the algorithm as promised. Dinesh has proven that when given the opportunity or a small stream of good luck, he is more than willing to ditch his friends. However, Richard keeps Dinesh on account that despite his disloyal acts, Dinesh is still very good at what he does. In season 5, Dinesh is promoted to senior management along with Gilfoyle and gains an obsession with being the \\"top Tesla driver\\" in the company. In Season 6, Dinesh is promoted to VP of Engineering but is usually disrespected by his employees. In the series finale \\"Exit Event\\", Dinesh initially recuses himself from participating in the Pied Piper team's attempt to sabotage the launch of PiperNet, believing that his pride and greed will be in the way. However, when he is notified that the faulty code meant to disrupt PiperNet was reverted, Dinesh personally walked to the top of the Salesforce Tower to install the faulty code, successfully crashing PiperNet. After Pied Piper closed, Dinesh and Gilfoyle began to run a large cybersecurity firm together, and lives next to each other as well. === Peter Gregory === Peter Gregory, portrayed by Christopher Evan Welch (season 1), is the billionaire founder and CEO of Raviga Capital as well a 5% equity owner of Pied Piper after his $200,000 investment. Gregory is extremely intelligent, but socially awkward, eccentric and fastidious. Historically, Gregory and Gavin Belson were friends, however their relationship soured as each went to run their own competing tech companies, making interactions between them awkward. Welch died after the fifth episode of season 1 was completed, but the character remained present off-screen for the remainder of the season. Gregory later died in the season 2 premiere. Monica is saddened by Gregory's death and still highly reveres him, becoming very disappointed whenever the values Gregory believed in and instilled in the Valley are dishonored, notably by Laurie Bream's profit- motivated approach to business. In season 4 it is revealed that Peter Gregory theorized decentralized internet years before Richard Hendricks did, but he was limited by the technology of his time. === Monica Hall === Monica Hall, portrayed by Amanda Crew, is an employee of Raviga Capital and associate partner under both Peter Gregory and later Laurie Bream. Monica is often charged with engaging with clients on a more personable and approachable way than either Gregory or Bream are, and as such forms a close friendship with Richard after she convinces him to launch Pied Piper on his own. In season 4, Monica was demoted by Laurie after she voted against selling Pied Piper to the highest bidder, which turns out to be Erlich's company Bachmanity rather than Hooli. Later, Monica realizes that Ed Chen, an up-and-coming colleague at Raviga, is attempting to remove Laurie, she notifies her, earning Laurie's trust in the process. They soon both depart Raviga to form a new VC firm, Bream/Hall and proceeds to fund Pied Piper. In season 5, upon realizing that Laurie plans to take advantage of Pied Piper once they get there Series B funding, Monica finally severs all business ties with her, and moves to Pied Piper as its new chief financial officer. In season 6, Monica continues to assist and advise Richard on business affairs and helped in Pied Piper's successful acquisition of Hooli. In \\"Exit Event\\", it was revealed that ten years after PiperNet's launch, Monica has moved to Washington, D.C. and is working for a \\"think tank\\", although later it was indicated that she was in fact working for the NSA. === Donald \\"Jared\\" Dunn === Donald \\"Jared\\" Dunn, portrayed by Zach Woods, is an ex-VP of Hooli who quits the company in order to join the Pied Piper team as its CFO and business advisor. Like Richard, Jared is anxious and vulnerable, but gains confidence as the series progresses and the company's success necessitates it. Jared is a graduate of Vassar College and provides the business skills that the largely engineering-oriented team lacks, which Gilfoyle admits is very helpful due to their disdain for the business side of startups, providing business strategies to the team such as scrum and SWOT analysis. He is also exceedingly optimistic, kind-hearted and staunchly loyal to Richard, sacrificing his high-paying and financially secure job at Hooli to lend his business expertise to Pied Piper. His birth name is Donald, but his former boss, Gavin, once referred to him as Jared, and the nickname stuck, despite the Pied Piper team knowing it's not his real name. He is frequently roasted by the other employees of Pied Piper, aside from Richard who often protects him, though he tends to be oblivious of this or too uptight to actually understand the insult. Jared is usually depicted as the most empathetic person on the team, given most of the team's moral ambiguity. Over the course of the series, Jared drops bits and pieces of his considerably dark backstory, such as being the product of a forced adoption to finding his biological father in the Ozarks. In season 5, Jared is promoted to chief operating officer of Pied Piper. In season 6, Jared leaves Pied Piper, feeling that it is no longer the company he loved and has refocused his efforts to advising developers at the incubator. His loyalty and respect for Richard have deteriorated following this decision. Jared later returns to help Pied Piper successfully acquire Hooli, but request that he and Gwart, the coder he is mentoring, be released from their contracts. Gwart would later leave to work for Laurie Bream. Later on Jared tracks down his birth parents, and learns that they gave him up for adoption because they thought they don't have enough room for a third child, only to discover later that they do. The experience traumatized Jared, causing him to become increasingly committed to helping other people. In the finale \\"Exit Event\\", Jared convinces Richard to sabotage PiperNet by using the example of J. Robert Oppenheimer's regret for developing the atomic bomb. After Pied Piper closed, Jared begins to work at a nursing home. === Gavin Belson === Gavin Belson, portrayed by Matt Ross (recurring season 1, starring season 2–6), is the CEO and founder of tech giant Hooli and the series' main antagonist, who embodies the soulless corporate culture that Richard is desperate to avoid with Pied Piper. Belson constantly spews forth pseudo-philosophical rants to his employees, who remain enamored with his work, but at the same time demonstrates complete ignorance and a mean spirit. === Jian-Yang === Jian-Yang, portrayed by Jimmy O. Yang (recurring season 1, starring season 2–6), is another tenant of Erlich's incubator, and the only person who lives there that is not involved with Pied Piper in any capacity. He speaks English with a mixed Cantonese-Mandarin accent. Jian-Yang and Erlich have frequent disagreements, given Erlich's racist bullying from the start. In general, Jian-Yang appears to play naive, but then takes advantage of Erlich's naivite or stupidity. For example, after Erlich complains how difficult it is for a landowner to evict a tenant, Jian-Yang decides to take advantage of this fact and lives rent-free in Erlich's house for a year. As payback for Erlich's racist abuse, Jian-Yang often insults and makes prank calls to Erlich, and takes a sadistic enjoyment in tormenting him. At the end of the show, Jian- Yang has assumed Erlich's identity. === Laurie Bream === Laurie Bream, portrayed by Suzanne Cryer (season 2–6), is the replacement for Peter Gregory as CEO of Raviga Capital, and later co-founder of Bream Hall Capital with Monica. Like her predecessor, Laurie is highly intelligent and socially inept, but appears to rely more on tangible metrics than Peter. Further, unlike him, she is completely devoid of empathy, emotion or any kind of idealism, concerning herself only with making a profit. Little is known about Laurie's personal life, except that she's recently had her fourth child, and is taking low dose MDMA for severe post-partum depression. In season 2, Laurie initially offers Pied Piper $20 million in Series A funding at a $100 million valuation, but Richard instead takes half of Laurie's offer upon advice from Monica. After Hooli files a lawsuit against Richard, Laurie drops Pied Piper from Raviga's portfolio. After Richard won against Hooli in binding arbitration, Laurie buys Russ Hanneman's stake and three board seats in Pied Piper, and immediately removes Richard as CEO in an emergency board meeting. In season 3, Laurie offers Richard to stay on as CTO and reserve his board seat, which Richard initially refuses until he met with Jack Barker, Laurie's choice for CEO. After a disagreement between the Pied Piper team and Jack on what platform to develop, Laurie sides with Pied Piper upon realizing the value of their platform and fires Barker, later reinstalling Richard as CEO. After it was discovered that Jared had been using click farms to increase Pied Piper's Daily Active Users (DAU), Laurie proceeds to sell Pied Piper to the highest bidder. Initially thought to be Hooli, Laurie later sells Pied Piper to Bachmanity, owned by Erlich and Big Head, after they outbid Hooli by one dollar. However, Monica is demoted as a result for voting against Laurie. In season 4, Laurie becomes pregnant with her fourth child and faces a hostile takeover from Ed Chen. She proceeds to partner with Monica upon learning her loyalty and forms a new VC called Bream-Hall together, later agreeing to fund Pied Piper once again after its concept of a decentralized internet was successfully proven. In season 5, Laurie initially offers Pied Piper $30 million in series B funding, but later reveals that she plans to leverage them into collecting user data and other actions, leading to Pied Piper pulling out and fund itself through its ICO, PiperCoin. Laurie later partners up with Yao, a Chinese businessman who owns YaoNet, the version of Pied Piper developed by Jian-Yang, and attempts a failed hostile takeover of Pied Piper's network. In season 6, Laurie is revealed to have split from Yao and has moved YaoNet's operations to the U.S. She later partners with Maximo Reyes, the Chilean businessman who attempted to buy a $1 billion stake in Pied Piper. The Pied Piper team later found her at RussFest, where she revealed that she was spying on PiperNet's abilities. In the series finale \\"Exit Event\\", Laurie is revealed to be in prison ten years after the initial PiperNet launch, although the reason for her imprisonment was never told. === Russ Hanneman === Russ Hanneman, portrayed by Chris Diamantopoulos (recurring season 2–3, starring season 4 and 6, guest season 5), is a brash, loud and fiery billionaire investor who provides Pied Piper with their Series A funding. He initially earned his fortune by \\"putting radio on the internet\\" (a parody of how Mark Cuban earned his wealth), and is very protective of his billionaire identity. At the end of season 2, Russ sells his share of Pied Piper to Raviga Capital after it won against Hooli in binding arbitration, helping him to become a billionaire again. Russ is later found broke due to putting all of his money into 36 ICOs, with only one of them being successful but losing the thumb drive containing the coin. In season 6, Russ approaches Richard and helps him avoid investigation from the Attorney General of California through his possession of dirt on the attorney general, and in exchange, Richard agrees to provide internet for Russ's three-day festival in the Nevada desert, RussFest. Although there were initial issues, the Pied Piper team successfully implemented a large decentralized service through artificial intelligence, leading to Russ purchasing a stake in Pied Piper before the launch of PiperNet. In the series finale \\"Exit Event\\", Russ reveals in a documentary produced ten years after PiperNet's launch that he has managed to earn his wealth back by investing in hair transplants. === Jack Barker === \\" Action\\" Jack Barker, portrayed by Stephen Tobolowsky (recurring season 3, starring season 4), is briefly the CEO of Pied Piper and later Hooli. He has a self- designed business model called the \\"Conjoined Triangle of Success\\", and often applies it in his career. In season 3, Jack is picked by Laurie Bream as the new CEO of Pied Piper, which Richard initially opposes until Barker tells him that he will turn down Laurie's offer if Richard leaves as well. The Pied Piper team, however, soon becomes disillusioned with his business approach, including his excessive spending on a new office and sales team. Barker later demands the Pied Piper team to make a data storage box, which the team initially tries to sabotage until it was inadvertently discovered by him. After discovering his attempts to undermine her, Laurie fires Jack as CEO. After running into Gavin Belson at an airport, Jack is hired as Hooli's head of development and immediately begins to work on the box he had planned to produce with Pied Piper with Endframe. In season 4, Jack and Gavin secure a deal with Chinese producers to make the Hooli-Endframe boxes. But on their way back, Jack requested the pilot to drop him off first at Jackson Hole, Wyoming instead of Mountain View. Upon finding out that the route caused him to travel a longer distance, Gavin is enraged. In retaliation, he moves Jack's office to the data storage room. Despite this, Jack remains optimistic, leading Gavin to track down his call history with his grandchildren. After Gavin is fired following the numerous COPPA violations in PiperChat, Jack replaces him as CEO and finds a way around the COPPA fines. After the Hooli boxes suffer a setback in their rollout at HooliCon, Jack acquires the VR company owned by Kennan Feldspar and uses it for a demo at the conference. However, the mobile demo, along with the unbeknownst installment of Pied Piper's internet, causes numerous Hooli phones to explode at HooliCon and elsewhere. Instead of a firmware update, Barker orders for 9 million Hooli phones to be replaced in a three-day span. He travels to Hooli's factory in China and attempts to boost production through a motivational speech, but is instead taken hostage by the workers. Gavin, who is in Tibet, learns of Hooli's failures and Barker's hostage situation and heads to the factory to successfully negotiate Jack's release. This helps Gavin regains the Hooli board's trust, and he regains his position as CEO and ousts Jack. ==Recurring characters== * Aly Mawji as Aly Dutta/Naveen Dutt (seasons 1–3), a Hooli coder who bullies Richard and Big Head.

His twin brother, Ben, is also a professional footballer for the Gold Coast Suns. ===2019 season=== King underwent a knee reconstruction after suffering a ruptured anterior cruciate ligament early in his draft year, an injury he was still recovering from when he was drafted. King returned to the field for the Sandringham Zebras in the VFL in May, playing 3 quarters and kicking 1 goal. In June, King sustained a right ankle injury whilst playing for Sandringham which prevented him from making an AFL debut in 2019. ===2020 season=== King made his AFL debut in St Kilda's round 1 match against North Melbourne.

Broas de mel are traditionally consumed at Christmas time (Natal), and in some regions on All Saints' Day (Dia de Todos os Santos). ==History== The giving and receiving of broas de mel traditionally carries a double meaning with the use of two expressions. The first, receber as broas (roughly, to receive the broas) represents the receiving of a gift, usually money. And the second, que ricas broas (roughly, \\"what rich/abundant broas\\"), contains an irony; for if one has had any problems that require the spending of money, the holidays only become poorer as a result. Another source states that the giving and receiving of broas represents the offering and receiving of good memories, remembrances or wishes. == References == Category:Portuguese cuisine Category:Portuguese desserts Category:Christmas food Category:Cakes Category:Biscuits ","title":"Broa de mel"},{"id":"60350603","text":"Gabriel Mälesskircher, or Mäleßkircher (c.1425/30 – c.1495) was a German painter; active in Southern Bavaria. He was a representative of the \\"Second Munich School of Painting\\". == Life & work == Part of his apprenticeship period may have been spent in the Netherlands. He is documented as having been in Munich after 1461. He served several terms as the head of the Guild of St. Luke (painter's guild) and became a member of the city council in 1469. He was elected the Zweiter Bürgermeister (assistant mayor) in 1485. That same year, he purchased the on the Starnberger See.Ernst Götz (Ed.): Georg Dehio (creator): Handbuch der deutschen Kunstdenkmäler, Bayern IV: München und Oberbayern, 2006, Deutscher Kunstverlag Munich/Berlin, pg. 568, The Mäleßkircherstraße in the Daglfing district of Munich is named after him. Much of his work was done on behalf of Tegernsee Abbey, because around 1450 he married Anna Ayrenschmalz, the sister of its Abbott, Konrad Ayrenschmalz (?-1492). Thirteen altarpieces created for the abbey (now in various museums) are considered to be his most important works. This includes scenes from the lives of the Four Evangelists, now at the Museo Thyssen-Bornemisza in Madrid. He also worked for and Rottenbuch Abbey. His workshop was very productive and, at one time, included Michael Wolgemut, of Nuremberg, who would become the teacher of Albrecht Dürer. In 1470, documents indicate that he received a major commission from Sigismund, Duke of Bavaria, which is believed to have been for work at Fürstenfeld Abbey. Much of his major work from 1474 to 1479 may be seen in the Galerie Schloss Schleißheim, the Bayerische Nationalmuseum and the Alte Pinakothek. He died in Munich during an outbreak of the plague. After his death, the workshop passed to his son, Caspar, who had been operating it since c.1485, when his father's health began to decline. ==Scenes from the Lives of the Evangelists (1478)== File:Gabriel Malesskircher 1478.jpgFrom left to right: St. Matthew, St. Matthew taming the dragons, St. Mark, Martyrdom of St. Mark, St. Luke, St. Luke painting the Virgin, St. John, The miracle of the hosts at St.John's tomb ==References== == Further reading == * Hans Dollinger: Die Münchner Straßennamen.

It has smooth, light coloured bark, glossy green egg- shaped to broadly lance-shaped adult leaves, club-shaped buds arranged in groups of seven, white flowers and bell-shaped fruit on a relatively long pedicel. ==Description== Eucalyptus bunyip is a slender tree typically growing to a height of about with smooth, whitish to light brown or yellowish bark with rough corky bark at the base of the trunk. The leaves on young plants are egg-shaped to lance-shaped, long and wide on a petiole long. Later, intermediate leaves are up to long and wide. Mature trees have large numbers of intermediate leaves in the crown. The adult leaves are broadly lance-shaped to egg-shaped, long and wide on a petiole long. They are more or less the same colour on both surfaces.

She has been a member of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly since March 2019, representing the electoral district of Murray as a member of the Shooters, Fishers and Farmers Party. Since her election, Dalton has been a vocal critic of NSW Government water management and alleged under-funding of rural hospitals, infrastructure and services. She has frequently clashed with government MPs in NSW Parliament, notably Health Minister Brad Hazzard and Water Minister Melinda Pavey, who has labelled Dalton a \\"disgrace\\". Deputy Premier John Barilaro called her a \\"disgusting human\\" on Twitter. ==Early life and career== Dalton was born in 1959 and raised on a sheep and wheat farm north of Rankin Springs in the Melbergen District. Dalton studied Education and worked for as a primary school teacher from 1981–1987. She owns a family farming business that produces maize, rice, cereals, cotton, beef cattle, wool and fat lambs. In 2007, she was awarded a Nuffield Australia Farming Scholarship. ==Political career== Dalton ran for parliament unsuccessfully in 2015 and 2017 as an independent and for the Shooters, Fishers and Farmers party, respectively. In March 2019, Dalton won the seat of Murray by a 26.2% swing, breaking 35 years of National Party incumbency. Bookmakers had her as a 9 to 1 outsider just two months before the election. In her campaign, Dalton presented a plan to address water mismanagement and corruption, argued for a royal commission into the Murray Darling Basin Plan, and pushed for better rural health and hospital services. She has continued to raise these themes as a state MP. Her maiden speech in NSW Parliament highlighted the rapid decline in service provision and living standards across rural NSW. Dalton has written a bill to improve transparency on who owns water in NSW If passed, the Bill will force state MPs to declare their water interests, and provide for a public water register allowing the public to search for the names of companies and individuals who own water. A parliamentary speech Dalton gave on the destruction of family farms across Australia has been viewed more than 330,000 times. She has also criticised excessive foreign ownership of Australian water and farmland. ==Personal life== Dalton married in 1984 and has four adult children. ==References== Category:21st-century Australian women Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Living people Category:20th-century Australian women Category:21st-century Australian politicians Category:Women members of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly Category:Shooters, Fishers and Farmers Party politicians Category:Australian schoolteachers ","title":"Helen Dalton"},{"id":"60350914","text":"Hamilton Park is a public park at 513 W. 72nd Street in the Englewood neighborhood of Chicago, Illinois. The park opened in 1904 as part of a plan led by the South Park Commission to add small neighborhood parks on Chicago's South Side. It was the first public park in Englewood. Landscape designers the Olmsted Brothers and architecture firm D. H. Burnham & Company collaborated on the park's design. The park opened with a fieldhouse, baseball field, wading pool, and walkways; within the decade, the designers added gymnasiums, a playground, and tennis courts. The fieldhouse has a Beaux-Arts design, and its inside features several murals of prominent figures in American history. The park was heavily used after it opened, and the fieldhouse in particular was booked so consistently that it was expanded in the 1920s.

He received a master's degree in mechanical engineering from Massachusetts Institute of Technology and a Ph.D. in mechanical engineering from the University of Toronto. Simmons contributes to the fields of mechanobiology, stem cells, microfluidics and tissue engineering. ==Personal life== Simmons reports being inspired to become an engineer and a teacher by his family from an early age. His father is an engineer who has been a recipient of the Ontario Professional Engineer Award, while his grandfather owned a machine shop where Simmons spent a lot of time early on in his life. His mother is a teacher who inspired him to teach engineering at the post secondary level and encouraged his curiosity for research. ==Education== Craig Simmons completed his Bachelor of Science in bioengineering at the University of Guelph in 1991 with distinction. He then continued on to receive his Master of Science degree in mechanical engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1994. Six years later in 2000, Simmons completed his Ph.D. thesis on the Modelling and Characterization of Mechanically Regulated Tissue formation around Bone-interfacing Implants at the University of Toronto under the supervision of Robert M. Pilliar and Shaker Meguid. ==Professional career== After completing his doctorate degree, Simmons worked as a postdoctoral fellow at David J. Mooney’s lab at the University of Michigan. In 2002, he started his postdoctoral fellowship in the University of Pennsylvania under the supervision of Peter F. Davies. Simmons returned to the University of Toronto in 2005 as an assistant professor. He received his title as a Distinguished Professor of Mechanobiology in 2016.\\"Craig Simmons named U of T Distinguished Professor of Mechanobiology\\". U of T Engineering News. 25 January 2016. From 2009 to 2014, Simmons lead the NSERC CREATE program in Microfluidics Applications and Training in Cardiovascular Health (MATCH) as its program director. MATCH trained over 70 graduate students in biomedical micro-technologies helping them to become professors, doctors, create their own startups and work in the medical device and healthcare industry.\\"Craig Simmons, P.Eng.\\". Peo.on.ca Simmons was also appointed as the scientific director of Translational Biology and Engineering Program (TBEP) in 2015 for a five-year term. TBEP is an interdisciplinary research initiative at the Ted Rogers Center for Heart Research that unites the University of Toronto, the Hospital for Sick Children and the University Health Network to advance treatments for cardiovascular disease. It focuses on three key research areas: 1) discovery in cardiovascular development, disease initiation and repair, 2) determination of molecular signatures or biomarkers for early detection and management of cardiovascular disease, and 3) regeneration of cardiovascular tissues using molecules, cells and materials.\\"Craig Simmons appointed Scientific Director of Translational Biology and Engineering Program\\". U of T Engineering News. 30 July 2015 He is also the Director, NSERC CREATE program in Microfluidic Applications and Training in Cardiovascular Health (MATCH) (2009–15). ==Research== ===Stem cell mechanobiology and tissue engineering=== This subgroup of Simmons lab works on strategies for culturing and conditioning pluripotent and mesenchymal stem cells. Projects have focused on disease modelling, therapeutic drug testing, and tissue engineering for the replacement of damaged tissues in cardiovascular systems. Ongoing projects include utilization of novel biomaterials and measurement techniques, development of bioreactors, and screening conditions for optimal stem cell culture.Usprech, Jenna; Romero, David A.; Amon, Cristina H.; Simmons, Craig A. \\"Combinatorial screening of 3D biomaterial properties that promote myofibrogenesis for mesenchymal stromal cell-based heart valve tissue engineering\\" - Ncbi.nlm.nih.govWang, Li; Dou, Wenkun; Malhi, Manpreet; Zhu, Min; Liu, Haijiao; Plakhotnik, Julia; Xu, Zhensong; Zhao, Qili; Chen, Jun; Chen, Siyu; Hamilton, Robert; Simmons, Craig A.; Maynes, Jason T.; Sun, Yu (27 June 2018). \\"Microdevice Platform for Continuous Measurement of Contractility, Beating Rate, and Beating Rhythm of Human-Induced Pluripotent Stem Cell-Cardiomyocytes inside a Controlled Incubator Environment\\" - Ncbi.nlm.nih.gov Some of their recent publications concern myocardial models, differential regulation of extracellular matrix components, and generating growth factor profiles to enable extracellular matrix accumulation within an in vitro tissue engineering environment. ===Microfabrication and microfluidics to control cell environment=== The Simmons lab aims to mimic the complex environments that cells reside in, These environments have significant impacts on the phenotype and function of cells. To account for these environmental factors, the Simmons lab integrates microfabrication with cell mechanics and advanced biology, along with the lab's mechanobioreactors. The goal is to stimulate cells in a controlled manner. The lab's microfluidic platforms models vascularized cell environments. They offer potential for incorporating on-chip biomolecular and cell-secreted factor detection in the context of physiological shear stress. These labs-on-chips would be an efficient means to investigate vascularized cell environments and aid disease diagnosis. ===Heart valve mechanobiology and disease=== The Simmons lab studies the mechanical and biological triggers that lead to sclerosis. It tries to identify though microgenomics techniques, the cellular and molecular differences in diseased vs. healthy heart tissue. Based on hypotheses about molecular regulators of valvular calcification and fibrosis, the lab uses in vitro co-culture systems to mechanically stimulate heart valve cells and investigate the phenotypic expression. The lab also works toward engineering a living heart valve tissue to repair defective valves. ==Honours== *Canada Research Chair in Mechanobiology (2006) *Ontario Early Researcher Award (2006) *Early Research Award, Department of Mechanical & Industrial Engineering (2009)\\"Craig Simmons  Faculty of Dentistry, University of Toronto\\".

The subscription was three guineas for eight concerts....\\" The concerts were influenced by the founders' background with the Concerts of Antient Music; but recent vocal works were also performed, by composers including John Wall Callcott, William Crotch and Reginald Spofforth. In the second year there were ten concerts. The concerts were discontinued in 1794, as the subscription had fallen off; the principal singers returned to the Ancient Concerts. ===Revival=== In 1801, with Thomas Greatorex and James Bartleman, Charles Knyvett revived the Vocal Concerts. There was a larger orchestra, led by Franz Kramer, and a chorus, and there were additional solosts. The general conductor was Thomas Greatorex at the organ. The subscription was four guineas for the season of nine concerts. Charles Knyvett withdrew from the management in 1803, but continued to perform at the concerts. Elizabeth Billington In 1803 Elizabeth Billington became the principal female singer: \\"the attraction of her name was such that the subscription... closed some days before the concerts commenced\\". She retired in 1810, and was succeeded by Angelica Catalani. In 1814 the concerts moved to the Hanover Square Rooms. By 1821 musical tastes had changed, and instrumental music was preferred. \\"Glees, English ballads, and the whole ancient school of vocal music, had gone gradually out of favour.... The establishment and rapid increase of the Philharmonic, however, may be considered as the more immediate cause of the failure of the Vocal Concerts.\\" In 1819 and 1820 the series was of six concerts, and in 1821 they came to an end. ==See also== * Professional Concerts ==References== Category:British music history Category:Concerts Category:Classical music in London ","title":"Vocal Concerts"},{"id":"60351091","text":"May Than Nu (; born on 27 January 1961) is a Burmese film actress.

The company's founder, Mario Malanca, started the venture by building mechanical parts and hubs for motorcycle wheels before producing his first complete motorcycle in 1956. The company found success in Italy, then eventually went on to produce bikes for Asia and America. Initially its engines were supplied by Franco Morini. Then, in 1960, Malanca built a new factory and started producing its own. In 1973 Mario presented the first 125cc twin cylinder Malanca at the Paris Motor Show. In 1978 Mario's son, Marco Malanca, was appointed CEO; by this time the company was officially known as Malanca Motors SpA. After his appointment, production focused mainly on 125cc models. After the peak of moped sales in Italy in 1980 and its eventual decline, Malanca moved on to larger-engined bikes. The company struggled, however, as it had spent much of its time and resources on the 125cc scooters as well as on research for, and development of, the smaller 50cc-engined bikes for both racing and regular sales. The company eventually folded in 1986.

Due to this historical tie, Sudan and Turkey share an Ottoman legacy, though little comparing to other Arab states. ==History before mid-20th century== The Ottomans, represented by Egypt of Muhammad Ali, conquered Sudan in early 19th century, which marked the era as Turkiyah (Turkish rule). Under the Turkiyah, Sudanese slavery was soon abolished as part of Tanzimat reforms, and economy of Sudan started to improve. Yet, due to the Ottomans' favoritism toward religious orthodoxy, it was met with resistance from the Sudanese. From 1870s onward, weakening Ottoman Empire paved way for the rebellion led by Muhammad Ahmad against the Turks. It was met with angers from both Egyptians/Ottomans alike, after Muhammad Ahmad proclaimed himself as mahdi, ignited the Mahdist War resulting with heavy military defeat of the Ottomans under British commands to the hand of the Sudanese Mahdists. It wasn't until 1890s that saw the Ottomans, reorganized by Herbert Kitchener, re-conquered Sudan in a costly and bloody war under the banner of the Ottoman Turks/Egyptians. With the outbreak of World War I, Britain separated Egypt and Sudan together from the Ottomans, and the two countries would have no official relations until mid-20th century. Nonetheless, the Sultanate of Darfur at 1916 proclaimed support to the Ottomans, which was marked by British annexation of Darfur to Sudan. ==Modern relations== With the independence of Sudan from Egypt at 1956, Sudan established relations with Turkey, with Turkey among the earliest nations to open embassy in Sudan. However, for most of late 20th century, Sudan–Turkey tie was characterized with remoteness and lack of interests, as Turkey has more interests in the Middle East and Balkans, while Sudan went into political turmoils. Despite this, relations were cordial under Gaafar Nimeiry, but had become cold under Omar al-Bashir from 1990s to 2010s. From 2010s, after years of neglecting relationship, Turkey, headed by the Islamist Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, started to diverting its attention to Africa, including Sudan, which has boosted the relations. Turkey has increased their presence in Sudan. One of the most notable is the lease of Sudanese island Suakin to Turkey in a 99-year contract, in which regional rivals like Egypt and Saudi Arabia have reacted with skepticism and suspicions. Turkey has denied attempt to build a military base in Suakin. This deal was cancelled by the transitional government after Bashir's overthrow. ===Sudanese protests=== Turkey has voiced support to Omar al-Bashir's Government in Sudan during the wave of growing anti-Bashir protest, and has pledged to send aids, ammunitions and supports to Sudan battling against protesters. ==Diplomatic mission== *Sudan has an embassy in Ankara and a consulate in Istanbul. *Turkey has an embassy in Khartoum. ==See also== * Foreign relations of Sudan * Foreign relations of Turkey ==References== Category:Bilateral relations of Sudan Category:Bilateral relations of Turkey Category:Relations of colonizer and former colony ","title":"Sudan–Turkey relations"},{"id":"60351455","text":"Romang may refer to: * Romang (island), an Indonesian island * Romang language, a Malayo-Polynesian language spoken on Romang island * Romang, Santa Fe, a municipality in Argentina == People == *Martin Romang, Swiss curler == See also == * Romange, a commune in the Jura department in the region of Franche-Comté in eastern France ","title":"Romang"},{"id":"60351461","text":"Perfluorodecanoic acid (PFDA) is a fluorosurfactant and has been used in industry, with applications as wetting agent and flame retardant.

Tertiary dentin is therefore a mechanism for a tooth to ‘heal’, with new material formation protecting the pulp chamber and ultimately therefore protects the tooth and individual against abscesses and infection. This form of dentine can be easily distinguished on the surface of a tooth, and is much darker in appearance compared to primary dentine. Tertiary dentine will often not be visible on the surface of a tooth, but because it is more dense it can be viewed on a Micro- CT scan of the tooth. Tertiary dentin on the surface of a gorilla tooth. The darker area indicated by the white arrow is tertiary dentin and has formed as a response to tooth wear. Wear on the surface of a tooth can lead to the exposure of the underlying dentine. When wear is severe tertiary dentine may form to help protect the pulp chamber. Frequency of tertiary dentin in different species of primate suggests teeth 'heal' at different rates in different species. Gorillas have a high rate of tertiary dentin formation, with over 90% of worn teeth showing tertiary dentine. Hominins have a much lower rate of tertiary dentin formation, with around 15% of teeth that have dentin exposed through wear showing tertiary dentin formation. Chimpanzees have rates in between gorillas and humans, with 47% of worn teeth showing ‘healing’. Clinical studies have researched the properties of tertiary dentine formation, including anatomy in both humans and animal models, usually from an oral health perspective. Genetic changes in animal models can increase tertiary dentine production. This suggests certain species may have evolved to produce tertiary dentin in response to dietary changes. For example, gorillas may have evolved high rates of tertiary dentin as protection against severe wear, since they consume a lot of tough vegetation. == References == ","title":"Tertiary dentin"},{"id":"60351737","text":"Sandy Herbert also known as \\"Jack Herbert\\" was an Australian professional rugby league footballer who played in the 1940s and 1950s.

Kellogg House, located at 1 Monroe Street in Battle Creek, Michigan, was built as a private house for Kellogg Company founder Will Keith Kellogg. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1985. In 1990, it was moved from its original location at 256 West Van Buren Street to its present location near the W.K. Kellogg Foundation headquarters. ==History== Beginning in 1880, W.K. Kellogg served as business manager at the Battle Creek Sanitarium, whose head physician at the time was Dr. John Harvey Kellogg, W.K.'s older brother. While there, W.K. experimented with grain-based substitutes for meat and bread, and accidentally discovered a process to manufacture cereal flakes. In 1906, W.K. Kellogg left the sanitarium to start his own company, then called the Battle Creek Tasted Corn Flake Company (later changed to the Kellogg Company). Despite established competition, Kellogg's company quickly became profitable. In 1909, Kellogg moved into a house located at 2650 W. Van Buren Street. In 1918, he married his second wife, Dr.. Carrie Staines, a physician at the sanitarium. He then had this house constructed next door, at 256 West Van Buren Street. The Kelloggs lived there until 1924, when they moved into an apartment building they owned. In 1927, Kellogg moved his sales manager, Dwight Mahan, into the house at 256 West Van Buren Street. Kellogg continued to own the house into the 1940s. In 1990, the W.K. Kellogg Foundation was in the process of building a new headquarters, and purchased the Kellogg's house. In march of that year, they moved it from its original location to a new site located across the river from their new headquarters.

It was called following the death of incumbent, Wong Tien Fatt on 28 March 2019. Wong was a 2-term Member of Parliament for Sandakan since 2013. He was a member and Sabah state party chairman (2015-2019) of the Democratic Action Party (DAP), a component party of the Pakatan Harapan (PH) coalition. Vivian Wong Shir Yee of DAP won the by- election by 16,012 votes out of the 21,595 votes cast with a bigger majority of 11,521 votes despite at a lower turnout rate at 54.44%. == Background == Wong Tien Fatt had died of heart attack on 28 March 2019. Causing the Sandakan seat vacant and a by-election was called. The Election Commission (EC) had set the polling day for 11 May 2019. Early voting was held on 7 May 2019 and Nomination Day on 27 April 2019. The electoral roll last updated on March 28 with a total of 40,131 voters was used. Of that figure, 39,856 are regular voters, 270 qualify as early voters and five voters who live abroad and qualify as absentee voters. Sandakan's registered voters are 49% Chinese, 44% Muslim-Bumiputra, 6% non-Muslim Bumiputra, and 1% Indian and others. ==Nominations== On 25 April 2019, Sabah Chief Minister Shafie Apdal announced that Sabah DAP's Vivian Wong Shir Yee, the daughter of the late incumbent, as the candidate for the alliance of Pakatan Harapan (PH), Sabah Heritage Party (WARISAN) and United Pasokmomogun Kadazandusun Murut Organisation (UPKO) for the by-election. On 26 April, Shafie Apdal said that the alliance would use DAP's logo for the by-election as DAP won by a vast majority using their logo in the 14th General Elections (GE14). United Sabah Party or Parti Bersatu Sabah (PBS); of the United Alliance or Gabungan Bersatu Sabah (GBS) had earlier mulls over their decision fielding a candidate. On 22 April 2019, the PBS finally announced their decision to contest the by-election. On 26 April, former Batu Sapi MP, Linda Tsen Thau Lin was announced as the PBS candidate. PBS would also used its own logo as GBS coalition is not registered while it had quit Barisan Nasional (BN) after GE14. Homeland Solidarity Party or Parti Solidariti Tanah Airku (STAR); one of PBS's two allies beside United Sabah People's Party (PBRS) within GBS alliance had earlier announced its intention to field economist Jenny Liew Wean Chee, 50, who is its Tanjung Papat division chief to contest the Sandakan by-election. Somehow STAR had later retracted earlier decision to contest in the by-election in order to support their GBS counterpart and ally, PBS instead. Sabah Progressive Party (SAPP) president Yong Teck Lee on 25 April had conveyed their backing for the party’s former foe, PBS to its president Maximus Ongkili in the by-election; for the interest of Sabah rights. Sabah Barisan Nasional (BN) and United Malays National Organisation (UMNO) chief Bung Mokhtar Radin said Sabah BN or UMNO would not contest the by-election but would support a single candidate from the Opposition front. There was speculation that Malaysian Chinese Association (MCA) might contest the by-election and Batu Sapi MCA Division Chief, Chew Kok Wah was touted as the candidate. On 21 April 2019, BN announced their intention to contest the by-election and candidate would likely come from the MCA or a direct member. On 22 April 2019, BN acting chairman, Mohamad Hasan made the final decision for BN to not contest the by-election. Sabah Native Co-operation Party (Anak Negeri) intended to contest in the by-election since BN opted out of it and wished BN would support them instead. However the party did not contest. Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), of which previous candidate Lim Ming Hoo contested the seat under BN ticket in the last GE14, announced that they would not contest this by-election. They also had earlier denied they had met their previous BN coalition partner, UMNO, and declared they would not work with them in the by-election. Another former BN component; Parti Gerakan Rakyat Malaysia (Gerakan) cancelled their plan to contest by fielding the ex-Sabah deputy chief minister, Raymond Tan Shu Kiah, for the by- election after he resigned abruptly from the party. He joined WARISAN later. The Sabah Pan-Malaysian Islamic Party (PAS) announced on 2 April that they were ready to field a candidate in the by-election and Sabah PAS commissioner Mohd Aminuddin Aling said the decision would be confirmed in a meeting later on. On 17 April 2019, PAS announced that they would not contest the seat and would support a candidate from the Opposition. United Sabah National Organisation (USNO) also declared they would not contest and would support the PBS candidate in the by-election. Businessman and former oil palm company manager Chia Siew Yung, 46, announced he would be contesting in the by- election as an independent. Other than Chia, at least two other independents, ex-Sabah National Trust Party (AMANAH) chairman / ex-Sabah PAS commissioner Hamzah Abdullah and youth activist Jufazli Shi Ahmad, also stated their wish to contest for the by-election. Sulaiman Abdul Samat, 36, the ex-Assistant Administrator of DAP Sandakan Parliament Service Centre, had also intended to join the by-election. On 27 April Nomination Day, Vivian Wong of DAP and Linda Tsen of PBS alongside with 3 independents, Chia Siew Yung (key), Hamzah Abdullah (tree) and Sulaiman Abdul Samat (chair) filed their nomination papers to set for a five-cornered fight in the by-election. == Controversies and issues == Finance Minister, Lim Guan Eng announced a RM2.28 billion development project to be held in Sandakan. This was widely criticised by social media for launching a project when the by-election was near. DAP candidate Vivian Wong was criticised for cleaning a Muslim cemetery. Social media users cited that it was a political gimmick to gain Muslim Bumiputera votes. PBS put up a controversial banner that claimed Finance Minister Lim Guan Eng had threatened Sandakan voters by saying he could not solve the issue of insufficient parking lots at the Sandakan Hospital in the event that DAP's candidate Vivian Wong lost in this by-election. DAP dismissed the claim and explained that Lim's remark was taken out of context. The banner was subsequently removed by the Election Commission. ==Results== ===Polling District Result=== DAP won all the polling districts and post votes.

After emigrating to st Croix, he married there Anna Elizabeth Leenhardt around 1775 and had with her five daughters. He escaped bankruptcy in 1777, when he was living at Fiskergade 4 in Christiansted and became around 1780 the Deputy Customs Official in Christiansted. In 1788, he lived at 10 Hospital Street with his wife and daughters, along with other dependants, and he was the government's Comptroller and a Customs Official. He worked as major in the Danish army and was also surveyor and cartographer. He lived at Kirkegade 5 in Christiansted in 1803. As government surveyor he surveyed disputed boundaries on the East End of St. Croix, but this map is now lost. However two of his maps survive: one showing a town plan of Charlotte Amalie on St Thomas was made when the town was rebuilt after two destructive fires in the early 1800s, the other shows Estate Bethlehem on St Croix in 1779.

She is married to Juan Guaidó, president of the National Assembly and a claimant to the country's acting presidency in the Venezuelan presidential crisis. She is considered by the White House and the National Assembly of Venezuela as the first lady of Venezuela. Also available online at AP News == Early life and education == Rosales was born in the town of Tovar, Mérida State, on 22 April 1992. Her father, Carlos, was a farmer, and her mother a journalist. As a child, she observed her mother's interviews and became interested in social issues. She assisted in running the family farm and decided to study journalism. Her father died after having a heart attack in 2013, for which she blames the shortages in Venezuela; she says \\"there was no medicine in his village to stabilize him, and no ambulance to take him to the nearest hospital\\". Her cousin died similarly, because products for a blood transfusion could not be found. In 2013, she graduated from Universidad Rafael Belloso Chacín with a degree in journalism and social communications. She worked in Mérida state for a city council as a press officer, and later held a similar position after moving to Caracas. She met Juan Guaidó at a youth rally, and they married in 2013. They have a daughter who was born in 2017. == Political activism == Rosales with Guaidó at a protest in February 2019 During her university studies, Rosales began working for the opposition party Popular Will (). As a human rights activist, she had close to 150,000 followers on Instagram as of 26 January 2019. She has stated that a motivating factor for her is that she does not \\"want [her] daughter to grow up wanting to leave Venezuela\\", and that she is \\"working for [her] daughter to inherit a better country\\". During the Venezuelan presidential crisis, Guaidó was designated acting president by the Venezuelan National Assembly, contesting the legitimacy of Nicolás Maduro. More than 50 governments have recognized Guaidó as the acting president of Venezuela, which implicitly gives Rosales a claim to being the First Lady of Venezuela. She told Reuters that spies and \\"pro- government armed groups\\" follow her and Guaidó. === Foreign relations === The New York Times says Rosales is \\"emerging as a prominent figure in [Guaidó's] campaign to bring change to the crisis-wracked country\\". She has assumed the role of international ambassador for the opposition, meeting with Bolivarian diaspora and regional leaders to solicit support for the opposition and her country. Rosales started in Latin America, meeting with Martín Vizcarra and Sebastián Piñera, presidents of Peru and Chile respectively, in March 2019. Rosales with Trump On 27 March, she visited the White House to meet with US President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence. She said that the crisis in Venezuela is serious, describing it as \\"freedom or dictatorship, life or death\\". Trump said it was a \\"great honor to have the first lady of Venezuela\\". From Washington, D.C., she went next to a meeting with Miami mayor Carlos A. Giménez, where she was given the key to Miami-Dade County. The Associated Press wrote that her \\"opponents have cast her recent tour as a desperate attempt to keep Guaido in the international spotlight\\", and quoted a diplomat from the Maduro administration, who said, \\"She is trying to boost Guaido's image, as support for his movement in Venezuela deflates\\". == References == == External links == * * Category:1992 births Category:21st-century Venezuelan women writers Category:First Ladies of Venezuela Category:Living people Category:People from Tovar, Mérida Category:People of the Crisis in Venezuela Category:Popular Will politicians Category:Venezuelan women in politics Category:Venezuelan women journalists ","title":"Fabiana Rosales"},{"id":"60352486","text":"Urai () is a rural locality (a village) in Asovskoye Rural Settlement, Beryozovsky District, Perm Krai, Russia.

Paley's equipment was used to create a passion play that was exhibited in New York. Edison met it with a lawsuit asserting copyright infringement over his film technology. The play received newspaper coverage in part because of fraudulent claims it was filmed in Germany and captured the original production when it was actually a staged recreation.

He was the biographer and publisher of the writings of Isaac Baer Levinsohn. ==Biography== Bernhard Nathanson was born to a wealthy Jewish family in Satanov, Podolia. He his early Hebrew education under Yosef Tzvi Polichinetzki and then under the supervision of his own father, and received rabbinical ordination in 1850. Under the influence of the Haskalah, Nathanson went to Odessa after his father's death in 1853, where he devoted himself to both Jewish and secular studies. There he co-operated with Jacob Israel Levinsohn, the nephew of Isaac Baer Levinsohn, in copying and revising the latter's manuscripts. Nathanson was occupied for three years on Levinsohn's Aḥiyah ha- Shiloni ha-Ḥozeh and Zrubavel. From 1871 to 1875 Nathanson lived in various places in Bessarabia, settling in Warsaw in 1875 in connection with the publication of the complete works of Levinsohn. He died there in February 1916 at the age of 83. ==Publications== Nathanson's first article, \\"Le-Torah veli- Te'udah\\" ('Torah and Testimony'), was published in Ha-Maggid in 1864. He later serves tas the Odessa, Kishinev, and Warsaw correspondent for Ha-Melitz in St. Petersburg, to which he also contributed stories and impressions of Jewish life. The more important among his articles, contributed chiefly to Ha-Melitz, are: \\"Tekunat Sefat 'Ivrit ve-Hargashoteha\\" (1868); \\"Kerobaz (1869); \\"'Al ha- Tzaddikim ve-'al ha-Ḥasidim\\" (1869); \\"Lefanim veha-Yom\\" (1870); \\"Zikronot le- Korot Odessa\\" (1870).

Her mother, who was illiterate, insisted she get the best and broadest education possible, and as a result she completed her schooling at the French Jaffa school College de Ferrer, and speaks five languages: Arabic, Hebrew, French, English and Spanish. She is the second of four children. Her first book of poetry, A Basket Full of Silent Languages (סל מלא שפות שותקות) came out in 2013, in both Arabic and Hebrew. Her second, I Am Two (אני זה שניים), also a bilingual volume, was published in 2018. Abou Shmeiss, who writes in Hebrew, won the Emerging Poets Award from the Israel Ministry of Culture in 2015. She has stated that she is constantly asked about this choice, whether simply because it seems odd to write in a language that is not one's native tongue, or because it is akin to \\"sleeping with the enemy\\". Abou Shmeiss says it was only years after beginning to write in Hebrew that she acknowledged that it is indeed a form of colonialism or occupation, but that it came naturally for her to write in Hebrew – to her Arabic is a holy language, the language of the Quran, and she would be diminishing it by writing her everyday thoughts and feeling. Her second collection, I Am Two, expresses this duality. She says that to Israelis, if she writes about her Palestinian identity, they view her as a traitor, and Palestinians view her that way because she writes in the language of their oppressor. She says, however, \\"I have learned to live in halves\\". For all the reasons she gives, those that are intentional and those she likes less, she says \\"I will probably never stop writing in Hebrew, thinking in Hebrew, and also dreaming. And my mother tongue is reserved for those who are close to me, and for God, mostly for God.\\" Her duality is not only as a Palestinian citizen of Israel. Abou Shmeiss is a feminist, wears short clothing by Muslim standards, and has tattoos, but also prays five times a day and fasts on Ramadan. She defines herself as a religious Muslim. The content of her poetry, however, is entirely derived from all aspects of her life: As a resident of Jaffa, a conquered city, as a marginalized minority, as a woman, as a member of her family, and more. She has participated in the burgeoning political poetry scene, such as Guerrilla Culture and Ars Poetica, the Mizrahi venue founded by Adi Keissar. She has read her poetry in other cultural venues, and has been asked to participate in international festivals, and contribute to various women's writing projects, such as \\"Women's Ramadan\\", a 2016 project by the feminist online magazine \\"Politically Corret\\", which featured an article about a pioneering Muslim woman, from various disciplines and fields, each day of the Ramadan holiday. Some of her poems have been translated and published in English. In 2015, independent filmmaker Noga Kalinsky made a short film about Abou Shmeiss, called \\"Silent Languages\\". Both her books have been highly praised by critics. Abou Shmeiss is married to Ahmed, and has one son, Mahmoud. Iaat and Ahmed became engaged when she was 15 and he 17, and were married when she was 18. == Works == * סל מלא שפות שותקות / A Basket Full of Silent Languages, Mitan, Tel Aviv 2013 * אני זה שניים / I Am Two, Mitan, Tel Aviv 2018 == Awards == * Shulamit Aloni Prize (I Am Two, Arabic Culture Prize), 2019 == References == == External links == Category:People from Jaffa Category:Israeli women poets Category:Israeli feminists Category:Living people Category:1984 births Category:Israeli poets ","title":"Ayat Abou Shmeiss"},{"id":"60353078","text":"Givat Harsina in 2019 Givat Harsina shown to the northeast of Hebron Givat Harsina ( ), also Ramat Mamre () is an urban Israeli settlement on the outskirts of Hebron, in the Judean Mountains region of the West Bank.

Born in Clapham, in London, Gourd joined the Independent Labour Party. He found work in the dockyards, and joined the Government Labourers' Union, a small union based around dock workers in Portsmouth. He was blacklisted for a time, due to his trade union activity, but was permitted to work in the yard again from 1904, and by 1914 was the union's secretary. He renamed the union as the National Union of Government Employees, and by 1920, it had grown to around 7,000 members. Gourd arranged for it to merge into the Workers' Union, becoming a full-time divisional organiser for the union. He also served as secretary of Portsmouth Trades Council. Gourd's increased prominence led him to serve as secretary of the Admiralty Industrial Council, and then of the Miscellaneous Trades Joint Council. He also served on the WO Industrial Committee, and the Government Co-ordinating Committee. He spent some time as a Labour Party member of Portsmouth Borough Council, representing Kingston. At the 1922 United Kingdom general election, the union sponsored him as a candidate in Portsmouth Central; he took 21.4% of the vote, but only fourth place. In 1929, the Workers' Union merged into the Transport and General Workers' Union, for which Gourd continued working. ==References== Category:1870 births Category:Year of death missing Category:Councillors in Hampshire Category:General secretaries of British trade unions Category:Independent Labour Party politicians Category:Labour Party (UK) councillors Category:Labour Party (UK) parliamentary candidates Category:People from Clapham ","title":"Arthur Gourd"},{"id":"60353209","text":"Joan Henley (2 September 1904 – 10 February 1986) was an Irish actress and radio presenter. She was active on the London stage since at least 1927 in inguenue roles, and appeared there throughout the 1930s. Her first film role was a supporting part in Purse Strings in 1933. She had a career of over 50 years in film and television, but her appearances were seldom and mostly small because she concentrated on the stage and her private life. She is probably best known for her role as the friendly spinster Teresa Alan in the Oscar- winning romance film A Room with a View, which was released less than a year before her death. Joan Henley married Bruce Belfrage in 1930 and they had a son, Julian Belfrage, who became an actor's agent. After her divorce from Belfrage, she was married to author Laurence Meynell from 1956 until her death. == Filmography == * Purse Strings (1933) as Ida Bentley * Charley's Aunt (1938 TV movie) as Donna Lucia * School for Randle (1949) in a minor role * Reluctant Heroes (1951) in a minor role * The Common Room (1959 TV series, one episode) * Peridot Flight (1960 TV series, three episodes) * The Reckoning (1970) as Mrs. Reynolds * The Rivals of Sherlock Holmes (1971 TV series, one episode) * Follow Me! as Dinner Guest * Hadleigh (1973 TV series, one episode) * Dial M for Murder (1974 TV series, one episode) * Days of Hope (1975 TV mini series, one episode) * Armchair Thriller (1978 TV series, one episode) * The Thirty Nine Steps (1978) as Lady Nettleship * A Room with a View (1985) as Miss Teresa Alan * The Good Doctor Bodkin-Adams (1986 TV movie) as Mrs. Morrell * Shades of Love: Sincerely, Violet (1987) as Maggie == References == == External links == * Category:1904 births Category:1986 deaths Category:Irish stage actresses Category:Irish television actresses Category:Irish film actresses Category:20th-century Irish actresses ","title":"Joan Henley"},{"id":"60353280","text":"The 2019 Mongolian constitutional crisis refers to legislation that has been criticized as threatening Mongolia's democracy by undermining its constitutional separation of powers. Though there is no consensus on the exact date the crisis began, many point to March 27, 2019, when the Mongolian Parliament adopted an unprecedented law empowering the National Security Council of Mongolia to recommend the dismissal of judges, prosecutors, and the head of the Anti-Corruption Agency. Proposed by President Khaltmaagiin Battulga, the law was ratified by a majority of the ruling Mongolian People's Party. ==Background== The Mongolian People's Party won the 2016 elections with a supermajority, claiming 65 of 76 total seats. In November 2018 Prime Minister Ukhnaagiin Khürelsükh survived a vote of no confidence in the wake of a 2018 scandal involving the fraudulent allocation of the Small and Medium Enterprises Development Fund. Empowered to dismiss the Speaker by a law proposed by President Battulga, Khürelsükh's supporters in Parliament eventually ousted Speaker of Parliament Miyeegombyn Enkhbold, replacing him with current Speaker Gombojavyn Zandanshatar. Khürelsükh promised to dissolve the cabalistic MANAN (a play on words between the Mongolian word for fog манан and the combined acronyms used by the two political parties involved) as part of a larger initiative to address corruption and restore justice. Khürelsükh received widespread public support for this on social media. At this point the judiciary was widely seen as the only remaining branch of government that posed a threat to Khürelsükh and President Battulga. Prosecutor General M.Enkh-Amgalan was a vocal critic of parliamentarians involved with the SME loan scandal. ==Events== Shortly after the public apology in late March 2019 by Minister of Justice Tsendiin Nyamdorj for the torture of suspects indicted for the 1998 murder of Sanjaasürengiin Zorig, the National Security Council of Mongolia sent an urgent order dated March 25, 2019, to President Battulga. The National Security Council of Mongolia currently includes the President, Prime Minister, and Speaker of Parliament. President Battulga proposed the law to Parliament on March 26. The opposing Democratic Party criticized the law as an attempt to seize state authority by force. Many law professors, lawyers, and former members of parliament protested that the National Security Council is not a constitutional body and warned of the dangers of putting the judiciary in the hands of the legislature and executive branches, particularly the long- term consequences of depreciating the checks and balances that underlie the 1992 Mongolian constitution. Former President of Mongolia Tsakhiagiin Elbegdorj held a press conference criticizing the law. On March 27, Parliament convened to ratify the law, where they first viewed and discussed the classified footage of Sanjaasürengiin Zorig's torture before voting. Despite members of the Democratic Party leaving parliament hall and refusing to vote, the law was ratified by a significant majority. The following day, both the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, Ts.Zorig, and Prosecutor General of Mongolia, M.Enkh-Amgalan, were dismissed by Presidential order. B.Amgalanbaatar, alleged to be involved with the SME loan scandal, took charge as Acting Prosecutor General. The torture video was shown to journalists on March 29, 2019, who were then allowed to convey its contents to the general public through written descriptions and drawings. ==Reactions== Amnesty International of Mongolia published an announcement on March 28, 2019, stating that the recently ratified law posed a serious threat to the independence of the judiciary branch and increased the risk of further illegal torture. Prominent lawyers said they would appeal to the Constitutional Court of Mongolia. Foreign language news did not report on the events. Mongolian media reported heavily on the events and social media platforms were active with discussion. The only English language article related to the constitutional crisis was posted on the UB Post. The National Human Rights Commission of Mongolia complained that Parliament only now took note of torture despite previously being notified 13 times from the Commission regarding torture. ==References== Category:Constitutional crises Category:Politics of Mongolia Category:Political history of Mongolia Category:2019 in Mongolia ","title":"2019 Mongolian constitutional crisis"},{"id":"60353338","text":"Railway Roundabout was a British children's television series produced by the BBC from 1957 to 1963.

Point of View, November 30, 2017. The film profiles a number of musicians, including Irving Berlin, Mel Tormé, Jay Livingston, Ray Evans, Gloria Shayne Baker and Johnny Marks, who made a mark on contemporary culture by writing many of the most beloved Christmas music standards even though they were Jewish rather than Christian; it focuses, in particular, on the way these songwriters helped to create the 20th-century shift from traditional liturgical Christmas music toward contemporary pop songs that address Christmas through universal themes of love, joy, peace, family and the sensual pleasures of winter rather than explicitly religious imagery. The young Larry is portrayed by Decker Williams in this documentary and it takes place in a Chinese restaurant where he and his family enters on about December 25, 1961. The film incorporates interview segments with figures such as musician Ben Sidran, comedians Jackie Mason and Mark Breslin and music writers Rob Bowman, Ophira Eisenberg and Robert Harris, interspersed with musical performances of some of the songs being discussed.\\"CBC documentary Dreaming of a Jewish Christmas has heft and beauty\\".

It made its debut at the 2019 Chicago Auto Show on February 7, 2019 and went on sale in the third quarter of 2019. This is the first Legacy model that isn't officially sold in Japan, as the nameplate usage ended there in June 2020. ==History== Series production of the seventh generation Legacy and sixth generation Outback started in July 2019. The first of each model was driven off the SIA production line in Lafayette, Indiana on July 29. The seventh generation Legacy was not marketed in Japan. Orders for the sixth generation Legacy were accepted through June 22, 2020 and production was discontinued after that. ==Design== The 2020 model year Legacy was moved to the Subaru Global Platform (SGP), which is torsionally stiffer compared to the previous generation Legacy. Its exterior styling is similar to the previous generation model, but the headlights and the taillights are slightly restyled. The interior now features an 11.6 inch touchscreen on all trims except the base model, which has two 7 inch displays. Notable mechanical changes include an updated base engine, the FB25 now featuring direct injection, and a turbocharged 2.4 liter FA24 flat four engine from the Ascent for higher trim levels which replaces the outgoing 3.6 liter EZ36 flat six engine. 90% of the components in the new FB25 are new compared to its predecessor.

She has originated featured roles in the ballet productions of Romeo + Juliet, Lifecasting and Ocean's Kingdom. She has also performed featured roles in a variety of ballet revivals, including productions of The Nutcracker, A Midsummer Night's Dream, The Sleeping Beauty and West Side Story Suite. Being of Filipino descent, Pazcoguin has advocated for better Asian representation in the ballet community. Pazcoguin has also branched out into musical theater. She made her Broadway debut in 2015 in a short stint as Ivy Smith in On the Town. She went on to play the role of Victoria the White Cat in the 2016 Broadway revival of Cats. ==Early life== Pazcoguin was born and raised in Altoona, Pennsylvania. She is biracial; her father is a retired surgeon who immigrated from the Philippines after medical school, and her mother is Italian. Growing up as a middle child with five siblings, Pazcoguin would try to get noticed by being \\"really weird\\", such as putting on performances of The Nutcracker with her siblings in the family's basement. She began training at the Allegheny Ballet Academy when she was four years old. Growing up, Pazcoguin also took classes in other dance styles besides ballet, including African, tap and jazz. She graduated from the Professional Children's School with a high school diploma. ==Ballet== In 2001, Pazcoguin enrolled in the School of American Ballet, the associate school of the New York City Ballet (NYCB). The following year, she started an apprenticeship with NYCB, and in 2003 became a member of its corps de ballet. She became a soloist following a promotion in 2013, which Pazcoguin says makes her the first Asian American female soloist in NYCB's history. With NYCB, Pazcoguin performed featured roles in the original productions of Romeo + Juliet (as the Nurse, 2007), Lifecasting (2009), Ocean's Kingdom (as Scala, 2011). She has also had featured roles in numerous NYCB revivals, including George Balanchine's The Nutcracker, Balanchine's A Midsummer Night's Dream (as Hippolyta), The Sleeping Beauty (as Carabosse) and West Side Story Suite (as Anita). The role of Anita, which Pazcoguin first played in NYCB's 2008 American Songs and Dances program, was the first that required her to sing on stage. Pazcoguin also appeared in the 2010 film adaptation of N.Y. Export: Op. Jazz, directed by Jody Lee Lipes and Henry Joost. ===Branding and advocacy=== Pazcoguin considers herself the \\"complete antithesis\\" of the stereotypical ballet dancer. During her early days at NYCB, she struggled with body image issues, noting in a 2013 interview with Time Out New York that she \\"will never be that super, super thin, skeletal [dancer]\\". She has since styled herself as \\"The Rogue Ballerina\\" as a means of embracing the qualities that make her stick out as a dancer, such as her body type and ethnicity. Pazcoguin is a proponent of greater diversity and inclusion within the ballet community. With former dancer Phil Chan, she started \\"Final Bow for Yellowface\\" in 2017, a campaign to combat Asian stereotypes in ballet productions such as The Nutcracker. ==Theater== After years as a corps de ballet dancer, Pazcoguin felt her career was stagnating and began to explore opportunities in theater. In 2012, she joined American Dance Machine for the 21st Century (a reboot of the American Dance Machine), a dance company that performs Broadway theater dance numbers. Pazcoguin made her Broadway debut in August 2015 for a two-week stint as a replacement for Megan Fairchild in the role of Ivy Smith in the revival of On the Town. Her next Broadway role came when she was asked to audition for Victoria the White Cat in the 2016 Broadway revival of Cats. She got the part and took a leave of absence from NYCB for the role. Pazcoguin noted that playing Victoria pushed her beyond her comfort zone, as the ingénue character was a departure from her usual roles and the part required her to sing and hip-hop dance. Cats officially opened in July 2016 and Pazcoguin eventually left the production in March 2017. ==Accolades== *2002 Mae L.

Intersektsionen Byuro was founded at the first conference of the Jewish labour movement in France, held in December 1910. Intersektsionen Byuro emerged from the efforts of Solomon Lozovsky, an exiled Russian-Jewish social democrat, and other Jewish radicals to unite different Yiddish-speaking union sections. It functioned as a link between the Jewish and French labour movements. Intersekstionen Byuro was modelled after the Deutsche Arbeiter Kartell ('German Workers Cartel'), the organization of German workers in France. Intersekstionen Byuro united Yiddish-speaking sections of unions among cobblers, locksmiths, woodworkers, bakers, leatherworkers, tailors and barbers as well as the Syndicat des casquettiers (Capmakers Union, the first Jewish trade union in Paris, founded in 1896). All in all, Intersektsionen Byuro gathered over a dozen trade union sections in Paris. The organization published the journal Der yidisher arbeyter ('The Jewish Worker') as its organ. The organization found itself in the midst of ongoing debates of the role of Jewish separatism in the labour movement; the Bundists wished to have a more distinct 'Jewish' movement whilst the anarchists claimed the Jewish separatism of the Intersektsionen Byuro was going too far. At the second conference of the Jewish labour movement, held in December 1912, the Bundists (refugees after the defeat of the Russian Revolution of 1905) proposed creating a completely independent Jewish labour centre (i.e. breaking the bonds with the French CGT). This proposal was rejected by the majority at the conference. The organization ceased to exist in 1914. In 1923 the Confédération générale du travail unitaire (CGTU) organized the Intersindikale kommisie as a continuation of the Intersektsionen Byuro, notably a majority of Jewish workers had joined CGTU in the CGT-CGTU split. ==References== Category:1910 establishments in France Category:1914 disestablishments in France Category:Ashkenazi Jewish culture in France Category:General Confederation of Labour (France) Category:Jewish anarchism Category:Jewish socialism Category:Yiddish culture in Europe ","title":"Intersektsionen Byuro"},{"id":"60353532","text":"The FR Tower Fire broke out on the eighth floor of the 22-storey building called FR Tower at the commercial Banani area of Dhaka city around 1:00 pm BST.

The October 1977 Thai coup d'état was a bloodless military coup which took place in Thailand on 20 October 1977, staged by the Royal Thai Armed Forces (RTAF). The coup was carried out under the nominal authority of Admiral Sangad Chaloryu of the Royal Thai Navy, head of the National Administrative Reform Council (NARC), but it was effectively led by General Kriangsak Chamanan of the Royal Thai Army, Supreme Commander of the RTAF. It led to the deposition of Prime Minister Thanin Kraivichien, who assumed the office following the 1976 coup d'état (which was also led by Admiral Sangad and resulted in the establishment of the NARCStaff report (Oct. 18, 1976). \\"A Nightmare of Lynching and Burning\\" Time.), in the immediate aftermath of the Thammasat University massacre. The October coup was preceded by the March 1977 coup d'état attempt, staged by a group of younger Royal Thai Army officers known as the \\"Young Turks\\", led by General Prasert Thammasiri, Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Royal Thai Army. Their attempted coup failed. The military justified their intervention in October because Thanin's government had divided the country, had virtually no public support, the economic situation had worsened, and people in general disagreed with such a long-term suspension of democracy. General Kriangsak assumed the office of Prime Minister, and served until his resignation in 1980. ==See also== * History of Thailand (1973–2001) * List of coups d'état and coup attempts by country#Thailand ==References== Category:1970s coups d'état and coup attempts Coup d'état October Thai coup d'état October 1977 coup d'etat October 1977 Coup d'etat October Thai coup d'état October 1977 Coup d'état ","title":"October 1977 Thai coup d'état"},{"id":"60353639","text":"Jim Sullivan was an Australian professional rugby league footballer who played in 1950s.

Writers such as Alison Pilkington and Robin Hill suggest that O'Leary's work deconstructs painting, expanding its possibilities into space while blurring boundaries between object and image with bricolage approaches they trace to Kurt Schwitters and Dada, as well as Arte Povera. O'Leary's exploration extends to the history of painting and its materials, as well as her personal and artistic history; she transforms studio remnants and detritus into new, tactile works through an intuitive, part-handicraft, part invention- through-need process that harkens to her Irish childhood, weaving personal memories into universal narratives.Baume, Sara. \\"Helen O'Leary at Catherine Hammond Gallery,\\" Visual Artists News, Visual Artists Ireland.

Retrieved March 25, 2019. ===Early paintings=== In her early work in Chicago, O'Leary created large-scale paintings that riffed on the \\"heroic\\" work of abstract expressionism (e.g., Untitled, 1989). She laid canvas on the floor, capturing drips, mistakes and overshot gestures normally bound for floorboards; for her, the process alluded to issues of class (e.g., servants washing floors) and subsistence (surviving off table leavings and cast offs). Chicago Tribune critic Alan Artner labeled her second solo show at Zolla/Lieberman (1991) a fulfillment of earlier promise, noting her \\"drawn, dripped and stenciled\\" works for an improvised look that \\"disguised their rigor\\" and that recalled the early abstractions of Kandinsky. Artner suggested that in the best works, her lattice-like forms \\"exploit fragility by suggesting a highly strung discourse that has run amok\\" with accretions submerging, encircling, overwhelming firmer shapes and gestures. After purchasing a home in Drumshanbo, Ireland in the 1994, O'Leary traveled more often. As a result, she sought to create still-epic paintings that could fit in suitcases and be reassembled; this extended her fragmented painting process further and led to new modes of creating, picking apart and exhibiting work.Falvey, Deirdre. Artscape: Review, \\"Trunk Show,\\" Irish Times, December 11, 2004. Aidan Dunne described a painting installation in this vein for EVA International in Limerick (1999) as a \\"sprawling but elegantly understated\\" recreation of the \\"crowded yet calming walls\\" of her studio.

She disassembled, repurposed, glued and patched older works and studio detritus (wood off-cuts, linen scraps, shards, fragments), refashioning them into new works exploring notions of support, stability and the boundaries of painting.Raidió Teilifís Éireann. \\" Hennessy Art Fund 2018: Helen O'Leary on 'dissembling painting,'\\" Raidió Teilifís Éireann, May 29, 2018.

Critics suggest the shift liberated her work to take on a variety of tenuous, three-dimensional forms: small, wall-mounted, façade-like pieces masking precarious scaffolding; free- standing, exposed grid-like constructions that read like absences, with open spaces replacing blocks of color (e.g., Armour - Delicate_Negotiations, 2014); and installations displaying a \\"kinetic, Tinguely-like potential.\\" O'Leary found inspiration in diverse sources, from bent and pierced armor to the combined concision and complexity of both Sean nós song—a form of Irish lament—and the literature of Beckett and poets Louise Gluck and Vona Groarke.Butler, Sharon. \\"Ideas and Influences: Helen O'Leary,\\" Two Coats of Paint, October 12, 2014.

It was signed by Mexican Miguel Santa María and Spaniard José María Calatrava. ==Background== From 1521, Spain had conquered the territory known today as Mexico and subjugated the indigenous civilizations living there, founding a colony which would be elevated to the category of viceroyalty in 1535 called New Spain. Spain ruled over Mexico for three centuries. On September 16, 1810, the Mexican War of Independence began with the so-called Cry of Dolores.Arias, (1880). tome IV, page 392 nota 2 The war ended in 1821, with the signing of the Treaty of Cordoba on August 24 and the Declaration of Independence of the Mexican Empire on September 28 of that year. This act was the result of the negotiations of the different factions participating in the war, including Juan O'Donojú, the last viceroy of New Spain on behalf of the monarchy. However, Spain would not recognize the treaties and the declaration on the grounds that O'Donojú was unable to make such arrangements.Zárate, Julio (1880). tomo III page 741 Even though most of the royalist armies within the Mexican territory had ceased hostilities and recognized the Treaties of Cordoba, the military incursions of Spain to try to reincorporate Mexico into its empire, did not cease for more than a decade. In 1825, the Spanish army seized the fortress of San Juan de Ulúa but was forced to retreat by Mexican forces. Later, another attempt by the Iberian country to reconquer Mexico culminated in the Battle of Tampico in 1829. Meanwhile, Mexico had tried unsuccessfully to take the island of Cuba, a bastion of the royalist government in the Gulf of Mexico, in order to diminish the influence of Spain on these seas, to prevent further incursions and open a way out to the Atlantic Ocean.Secretaría de Marina. Gobierno de México (2001) ==The treaty== In 1833, King Ferdinand VII died. He had ascended to the throne shortly before the wars for the independence of the American colonies began, leaving Spain in a terrible economic situation. He was succeeded by his daughter Isabella II, who was then a minor, so his mother Maria Cristina assumed the regency of the country, coinciding with the start of the First Carlist War due to the conflict of succession with Carlos María Isidro de Borbón, brother of Ferdinand VII. For this reason, María Cristina decided to adopt a more liberal attitude towards her government in order to attract popular support. This would be reflected, also, in a more open position regarding relations with the American countries to motivate trade and reactivate the damaged Spanish economy.Terán Enríquez, Adriana (2007) Mexico en lugar de Nueva España: el reconocimiento de una pérdida. México: UNAM. pages 17–18. . In 1835, Mexico appointed Miguel Santa María, who was already minister in the United Kingdom, as minister plenipotentiary to sign the peace treaty. For its part, the Spanish Regency appointed José María Calatrava. The treaty was signed in Madrid on December 28, 1836. It was published in Mexico on March 4, 1838.Arias, Juan de Dios; Olavarría y Ferrari, Enrique de (1880) tomo IV page 392 ==References== Category:1836 treaties Category:Peace treaties of Mexico Category:Peace treaties of Spain Category:1836 in Mexico Category:1836 in Spain Category:Mexican War of Independence Category:Mexico–Spain relations ","title":"Definitive treaty of peace and friendship between Mexico and Spain"},{"id":"60353757","text":"Hannes Vartiainen and Pekka Veikkolainen are Finnish filmmakers. == Biography == Hannes Vartiainen met Pekka Veikkolainen in Järvenpää in 1990.

Chandran. Joju George, Nyla Usha, and Chemban Vinod Jose portrays the titular characters, and also features Rahul Madhav, Vijayaraghavan, and Sudhi Koppa in supporting roles. The original soundtrack of the film was composed by Jakes Bejoy. The story is loosely based on events that occurred in 1980s-1990s Thrissur. The film was released in theatres across India on 23 August 2019 to positive reviews. It turned out to be a commercial success. It was the 5th film of 2019 after Lucifer, Kumbalangi Nights, Uyare and Virus to successfully complete 100 days in theaters. == Plot == In 1965, Porinju Joy and Puthanpally Jose are best friends in their youth, and Jose tries to persuade Porinju to confess his love to Alappattu Mariyam Varghese, but a then timid Porinju could not. One day at school, a boy bullies Mariyam and a fight ensues between Porinju and the boy. Since the boy was from an influential family and Porinju was from a poor family, the teacher punishes Porinju alone, striking him repeatedly. Porinju and Jose shout at the teacher and leave the school never to come back. Mariyam openly condemns the teachers attitude in front of the class, for which she is scolded. In 1985, Porinju is known as Kattalan (hunter, literally 'man of the forest') Porinju, now a village butcher and henchman of Iype Muthalali, a wealthy and powerful man at the locality. Porinju is very close to Iype, but Iype's sons do not like their relationship. Jose is an aspiring disco-dancer and performs his moves at the annual Perunnal of the church. Mariyam is now a money lender. The three of them still keep a close relationship, even though Mariyam has now become critical of Porinju and Jose for their troublesome life. Porinju now often openly woos Mariyam, which she ignores. On a perunnal night, a procession is going on in front of Mariyam's house, Jose dances along with Mariyam. Meanwhile, Iype's grandson Prince gropes Mariyam, she humiliates him in front of public. Jose beats Prince and drives him away back to his house. As the procession advances later towards Iype's house, Prince tells his uncles about the incident and together they beat Jose. Porinju breaks up the fight, but Prince still beats him, leading to him and Jose beating up Prince and the uncles. Iype, though seeing his sons getting beaten up, ignores it. In a flashback, Mariyam was about to elope with Porinju but her father Varghese ties a rope around his neck and threatens to hang from a tree if she ran away. However, he loses his grip and accidentally hangs himself. Due to this, she lives alone without marrying Porinju. A year later, as the Perunnal nears, Prince arranges hitmen to kill Porinju and Jose. Jose gets killed while at a movie theater. For this, Porinju takes revenge and hacks Prince to death in front of the Perunnal procession. Prince's uncles arrange other hitmen to kill Porinju, but Porinju kills them and scares the uncles away, sparing them. Meanwhile, Mariyam arranges to get bail for Porinju in case he goes to court for the killings. Iype's household, including Iype himself, is mourning for Prince's death. The Perunnal procession passes by the house, and he comes out to greet them. Porinju also arrives and the two dance together happily. However, Iype takes out a hidden knife and stabs Porinju multiple times, saying that his grandson's life matters to him, but not Porinju's. The bystanders surround Iype, but Porinju snatches the knife and tells everyone to back off, and orders Iype to go back to his own house. Mariyam arrives, and he dies in her arms. In the end, Mariyam stands in front of Porinju's gravestone. The stone also has her name inscribed on it, with a vacant death date. Mariyam then watches a fight going on between some children while they are playing football, and she smiles. == Cast == *Joju George as Kattalan Porinju *Nyla Usha as Alappattu Mariyam Varghese *Chemban Vinod Jose as Puthanpally Jose *Vijayaraghavan as Iype Muthalali *Rahul Madhav as Prince *Sudhi Koppa as Puthanpally Babu *Salim Kumar as Beedi Joy (Porinju's father) *TG Ravi as Anthony (Jose's father) *Sarasa Balussery as Jose's mother *Nandhu as Varghese (Mariyam's father) *Swasika as Lizy Jose *Malavika Menon as Lilly *Parvathi T. as Susanna (Prince's mother) *Sadhika Venugopal as Alice *Remya panikkar as Sherly *I.

Designed by the Brazilian Caio Jordão, the Colt was publicly introduced at AirVenture, in Oshkosh, Wisconsin in July 2019. The aircraft is supplied ready-to-fly. The design first flew in 2018 and met the ASTM standards as a light-sport aircraft in September 2019. The first customer delivery was in January 2020. ==Design and development== The aircraft is based upon the Brazilian Jordão-designed INPAER Conquest 180, developed to comply with the US light-sport aircraft rules. It features a strut-braced high-wing with flaps, a two-seats-in-side-by-side configuration enclosed cockpit accessed by doors, fixed tricycle landing gear with wheel pants and a single engine in tractor configuration. The aircraft is made with a welded 4130 steel tubing cockpit cage, with the rest of the airframe aluminum construction, covered in aluminum sheet. The Colt has yoke controls, four point harnesses, a Galaxy GRS 6/600 SD Speedy ballistic parachute and a basic glass cockpit. The standard engine used is the Rotax 912ULS four-stroke powerplant. In September 2019 the type completed ASTM testing to qualify for the US light-sport category, and is listed as the \\"Colt 100\\" on the Federal Aviation Administration's list of approved special light-sport aircraft. The company plans to build six to eight aircraft in 2019 and 24 during 2020, at its plant at South Texas Regional Airport in Hondo, Texas. The plant was officially opened in February 2019 and employs many ex-U.S. military aircraft maintenance personal to build the aircraft. Prices have not been announced, but sales are to start in July 2019. In July 2020 the company announced that it was developing an electric aircraft variant. The eColt will be powered by lithium-sulfur batteries and will have a greater than two-hour endurance, giving a range of . In August 2020 the manufacturer announced that the aircraft would be available with the Garmin G3X Touch EFIS and Garmin GTN 650 GPS/NAV/COMM/MFD, in response to demand from flight schools that want to use the aircraft for flight training. ==Operational history== The first customer aircraft was delivered to a private owner in January 2020. In a flight review in February 2020 AVweb's Paul Bertorelli praised the aircraft's handling and cabin ergonomics once seated. He faulted the cabin entrance size, however, writing, \\"the problem is getting in because the door has an upper sill that forces you to duck to ingress. It proved only a slight problem for my 5-ft. 8-in. frame, but taller pilots or those long of torso may struggle.\\" He also noted the design's limited useful load, \\"at 836 pounds empty, the Colt has 484 pounds of useful load. That’s two 200-pounders and 14 gallons of gas. That’s fine for a training flight, but not so fine for cross- country flying where you might also wish to carry some baggage. So if you carry full fuel, the people better not weigh more than 300 pounds total.\\" Of the design overall he concluded, \\"the Colt’s performance is workmanlike, but not exceptional. If it stands out at all, my view is that it’s a little airplane masquerading as a big one. The ergonomics are excellent and the handling is well sorted, especially if the airplane finds a home as a trainer. Teaching landings in it would be a blast.\\" ==Specifications (Colt) == ==References== ==External links== * *AVweb video review Category:2010s United States sport aircraft Category:Light-sport aircraft Category:Single-engined tractor aircraft ","title":"Texas Aircraft Colt"},{"id":"60353956","text":"Wang Ji (1463-1539) was a Ming physician who published an early medical casebook.Joanna Grant, A Chinese Physician: Wang Ji and the Stone Mountain Medical Case Histories, Routledge, 2003. 200px ==Works== * Shishan yian [Stone mountain medical case histories], 1520. * Zhenjiu Wen Dui [Acumoxa Questions and Answers], 1530 * Tui qiu shi yi [Ascertain the master’s meanings] * Waike lili [Patterns and Examples for External Medicine] ==References== ==External links== * Portrait of Wang Ji Category:1463 births Category:1539 deaths Category:Medieval Chinese physicians Category:Ming dynasty writers Category:Chinese non-fiction writers Category:Writers from Anhui Category:Physicians from Anhui Category:People from Huangshan ","title":"Wang Ji (Ming dynasty)"},{"id":"60353979","text":"Say It With Acting is an American television game show that was broadcast on NBC from January 8, 1951, until May 1951, and on ABC from August 1951 until February 22, 1952. ==Background== The program began in January 1949 as a local show, Look Ma, I'm Acting, on WNBT-TV in New York City. It was the first TV program for which Bill Cullen was host. For each scene performed by actors, a viewer was called and asked to describe the scene in a single word, with a prize given for a correct answer. On February 20, 1949, the NBC network began to carry the show, with the new title Act It Out. It ran until August 7, 1949. == Format == Say It With Acting pitted two teams against each other in charades competition. Bud Collyer and Maggi McNellis were team captains each week. Ben Grauer was the host. Each four-member team consisted of actors and actresses from a current Broadway play, and the winning team returned the following week to face a new opponent. Players' pantomimes had to communicate \\"tough sayings, or titles of books, plays, songs—things like 'The Dreadful Dragon of Hungry Hill,' 'Neurotic You and Psychopathic Me,' or 'As fluffy as a fleecy cloud.'\\" Teams competed against the clock, with the team that used less time being the winner. ==Sponsor and schedule== Brown Shoe Company's Naturalizer division sponsored Say It With Acting from 6:30 to 7 o'clock on Saturday nights on NBC.

Many are crucial indicator organisms in the bioassessment of freshwater (e.g.: Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, Trichoptera) and marine (e.g. Annelida, Echinoderms, Molluscs) ecosystems. Since its introduction, the field of DNA barcoding has matured to bridge the gap between traditional taxonomy and molecular systematics. This technique has the ability to provide more detailed taxonomic information, particularly for cryptic, small, or rare species. DNA barcoding involves specific targeting of gene regions that are found and conserved in most animal species, but have high variation between members of different species. Accurate diagnosis depends on low intraspecific variation compared with that between species, a short DNA sequence such as Cytochrome Subunit Oxidase I gene (COI), would allow precise allocation of an individual to a taxon. == Methodology == While the concept of using DNA sequence divergence for species discrimination has been reported earlier, Hebert et al. (2003) were pioneers in proposing standardization of DNA barcoding as a method of molecularly distinguishing species. Specimens collection for DNA barcoding does not differ from the traditional methods, apart from the fact that the samples should be preserved in high concentration (>70%) ethanol. It has been indicated that the typical protocol of storing benthic samples in formalin has an adverse effect on DNA integrity. The key concept for barcoding macroinvertebrates, is proper selection of DNA markers (DNA barcode region) to amplify appropriate gene regions, using PCR techniques. The DNA barcode region needs to be ideally conserved within a species, but variable among different (even closely related) species and therefore, its sequence should serve as a species-specific genetic tag. Therefore, the selection of the marker plays an important role. Cytochrome Subunit Oxidase I gene (COI) is one of the most widely used markers in barcoding of macroinvertebrates. Other markers that can be used are ribosomal RNA genes 16S and 18S. Moreover, sorting invertebrates into different size categories is useful, since specimens in a sample can vary widely in biomass, depending on species and life stage. For further details on methods see DNA barcoding. === DNA metabarcoding === Due to the significant number of taxa that compose aquatic macroinvertebrate communities, DNA metabarcoding method is generally used to assess distinct taxa within bulk or water samples. DNA metabarcoding is a method that consists of the same workflow as DNA barcoding, distinguished by the use of high-throughput sequencing (HTS) technologies. The potential of DNA metabarcoding in the assessment and monitoring of various taxonomic groups, has been successfully demonstrated in several studies. Numerous researchers have used metabarcoding methods to classify benthic macroinvertebrates from tissue samples, indicating its feasibility and higher sensitivity from classical taxonomy methods. Others, validate the use of next- generation sequencing (NGS) technologies in environmental samples to evaluate water quality in marine ecosystems and in freshwater biodiversity studies, including macroinvertebrate species assessment. Applications of these technologies in environmental samples is constantly increasing. Most of the recent studies are based on advancing eDNA approaches' implementation, field validation, platform and barcode choice or database limitations. == Application and challenges == Macroinvertebrates (meta)barcoding methods are often used in: * Biodiversity assessment. Because of the large number of macroinvertebrate species, sample processing (sorting and identification) is laborious and often difficult task that can lead to errors during the assessment. * Environmental monitoring programs. Macroinvertebrates within the same system may be residents from several months to multiple years, depending on the lifespan of each organism. Consequently, macroinvertebrate communities inhabit aquatic ecosystems long enough to reflect the chronic effects of pollutants and yet short enough to respond to relatively acute changes in water quality. Because of the limited mobility of macroinvertebrates and their relative inability to move away from adverse conditions, the location of chronic sources of pollution often can be pinpointed by comparing communities of these organisms. * Detection of alien species. Application of eDNA and (meta) barcoding techniques are constantly increasing in the studies of invasion processes. * Species identification. ‘Species’ level identification requires a high level of taxonomic expertise. Different developmental stages of macroinvertebrates are often difficult to identify morphologically, even for experts, especially because of the lack of appropriate identification keys for aquatic macroinvertebrates . For some aquatic invertebrates taxa for example, taxonomic identification is only possible for males and some late instars, but the coupling of barcoding with traditional taxonomy provides a robust framework for biological identification. Often, species cannot be identified as they are morphologically cryptic, similar or represent less known groups. It has been suggested that a combined analysis of morphological and molecular data could provide the best solution into what is called “integrative taxonomy”. Number of studies have used barcoding or metabarcoding approaches on different groups, for example Odonates, specifically dragonflies (Anisoptera) and the damselflies (Zygoptera), with recommendation to use combination of markers. * Stress response. Individual freshwater invertebrate species, often merged to a higher taxonomic level for biomonitoring purposes, can differ substantially in their tolerance to stressors and respond in more complex ways than observed at genus level. Identifications based on DNA barcoding have the potential to improve detection of small changes in stream conditions. Recent results showed that DNA barcoding can increase taxonomic resolution and thereby, increase the sensitivity of bioassessment metrics. There are also many challenges when it comes to genetic barcoding of aquatic macroinvertebrates: * Reference libraries. Availability of reference libraries of DNA barcodes is very important in species' identification. *Missing species in databases. Information about existing species are usually not complete or correlated with ecological parameters such as depth, sampling technique, salinity etc. *Validation of data quality. Databases' records are often not currated. *Outdated taxonomy. Species in databases can be sometimes named with outdated taxonomy (e.g. synonyms). *Quantitative measurement of species diversity (estimation of biomass and abundance of species). *Lacking DNA information. Species in earlier literature are identified only by taxonomic features of which no DNA samples exist to confirm. *Technical challenges must be taken into consideration, such as the need to apply different protocols when working with different organisms, selection of an appropriate DNA barcoding markers, primer design (identication of conserved regions suitable as primer-binding sites, evaluation of the taxonomic coverage and the ability of the amplified regions to resolve taxa at the family level, etc.). *Costs related with sequencing. == See also == *DNA barcoding *Fish DNA barcoding *Algae DNA barcoding *PCR *Sequencing == References == Category:Animal models Category:DNA Category:Animal anatomy ","title":"Aquatic macroinvertebrate DNA barcoding"},{"id":"60354096","text":"George Hugo was an Australian professional rugby league footballer who played in the 1950s and 1960s.

Johnson's mother was deeply disappointed to find herself marrying a prosperous older man as his third wife, having been in love with a young but poor Dunne cousin. Johnson was his father's only son. He was first educated at Holt Grammar School, then was tutored by a clergyman called Reeve at Bungay and another called Buck near Saffron Walden.

Johnson was ordained a deacon and priest in 1793 and after leaving Cambridge became a curate at Dereham, living there with his sister Catharine (1767–1820). In the same year he was appointed as Chaplain to the Earl of Peterborough and Vicar of Hempnall. However, when Cowper's close friend Mary Unwin became paralysed, needing constant attention, Johnson moved her and Cowper to Norfolk and gave up his parish duties. Mrs Unwin died in December 1796, and Cowper became depressed and ill, remaining with the Johnsons until he died on 25 April 1800. After Cowper's death, Johnson had a long correspondence with another cousin of Cowper's, Harriett Hesketh, which was published in 1901. In 1800, Johnson was appointed as Rector of Yaxham and Welborne, benefices he held until his death.

The film is produced by Cairo Cannon, Maggie Monteith, and Luc Roeg. The film stars Mamie Gummer, James Caan, Toby Jones, Patricia Clarkson, and Jacki Weaver in the lead roles. The film is based on Martin Amis' 1997 novel Night Train. == Plot == Detective Mike Hoolihan (Patricia Clarkson) is investigating the murder of Jennifer Rockwell (Mamie Gummer), an astrophysicist at an observatory in New Orleans. She had presented a talk on black holes in the evening, but was found dead in the morning by the manager of the observatory (Toby Jones). She had been shot in the face, but there was no weapon. There is a sock and a jar of moisturizing cream found at the scene. The manager claims that he was out all night with an associate. The sock is traced to Jennifer's boyfriend, who claims he left hurriedly to work on a new theory. Jennifer's home is full of tchotchkes and other old knick-knacks. Mike passes out when she picks up a Florida snow globe, and imagines unique blue marbles similar to one that is on a string around her neck. When she comes to, she talks about the marble, and how she doesn't remember where it came from. She was an orphan, and has always had it. Her co-investigator and supervisor suggest that this looks like \\"The .38 Caliber Killer\\", who killed young women, but hadn't struck in many years. The murderer always exchanged knick-knacks with his victims. While doing a more detailed search of the area, Mike finds a gun in a case, and a red scarf she had been having dreams about. The gun, a .38 revolver, is traced to the observatory manager, who admits he found it, and tried to dispose of it so he wouldn't be a suspect. Figuring from where the gun originally lay, Mike concludes that Jennifer had shot herself. The investigators agree. In photos of the crime scene, Mike realizes that there are no photos of the jar of moisturizing cream that she noted. When she buys a jar of the cream, she reacts as if memories come flooding back. A video made during Jennifer's presentation on black holes shows some of the people who attended. There is a shadow of a man with a cap - very much like Jennifer's father's. Mike checks out the family home, and Jennifer's 2 brothers. She finds an old brooch that Jennifer had been wearing, but was missing from the murder scene. As she speaks with the family members, it becomes clear that Jennifer's father (James Caan) is an intimidating figure, and other family members are afraid of saying much around him. Mike notices that an object from one of the .38 Caliber Killings is in a picture of the family. A witness from one of the old murders recounts hearing the suspect walking as if he had a cane, just like Jennifer's father. In photos of the father, he seems to switch the cane from his right to his left hand, using it inconsistently. It appears that the father had been killing young women who looked like his mother, but the killing had stopped when his daughter (Jennifer) was born. Mike goes to a gun shop and buys a .38 revolver. She confronts Jennifer's father, but he grabs the gun from her and talks her out of her suspicions. She returns to the observatory, and considers suicide, but instead checks out an old, boarded up house. In the house, she relives the murder of her mother. She was hiding in a closet when the .38 Caliber Killer shot her. Young Mike came out of the closet and rubbed the moisturizing cream on her dead mother's hands, asking her to wake up. Blue marbles had spilled all over the floor, and young Mike carries one out as she leaves with a police officer. The killer had taken the Florida snow globe. Mike gets into her car, and drives away, knowing that she has solved the mystery of Jennifer's death, the .38 Caliber Killer, and her own demons. == Cast == * Patricia Clarkson as Detective Mike Hoolihan * Toby Jones as Professor Ian Strammi * Jacki Weaver as Miriam Rockwell * James Caan as Colonel Tom Rockwell * Mamie Gummer as Jennifer Rockwell * Aaron Tveit as Tony Silvero * Jonathan Majors as Duncan J.

Being two ancient countries, trades between Carthage and Ptolemaic Kingdom was extremely abundant, if not say, good and extensive. Nonetheless, rivalry existed between two countries, as the Egyptians didn't trust the Carthaginians and sometimes turned against the Carthaginians, making it complicated. This complicated nature between two nations would maintain until the end of antiquity and beginning of medieval eras. War elephants of Hannibal were thought to have traced from the Egyptians, many took parts on Hannibal's failed attempts to conquer Rome. Both Egypt and Tunisia were together fallen to various empires later, the Roman Empire, the Arab Caliphates and Ottoman Empire. The most influential among all were the conquests led by Arabs on two countries, in which two nations adopted the Arabic language instead of their ancient languages, and the arrival of Islam. The influence of Islam and Arab also caused significant remarks, with some of the oldest ongoing institutions located in two countries, notably Al-Azhar University in Egypt and Great Mosque of Kairouan in Tunisia. With the Ottoman conquest, Egypt and Tunisia were together placed under the Turks, but Ottoman rule in two diverged by differences. Ottoman Egypt and Ottoman Tunisia both functioned as autonomous provinces of the empire, but relationship were remarkedly different. The Tunisians, in majority, remained loyal to the Ottoman state, and had been one of the earliest regions to support the Tanzimat, including abolishment of slavery which was one of the earliest in the world, at 1846, and was even among some of the most liberal parts of the empire; but the Egyptians had a number of conflicts with the Turks, dating back to the Ottoman–Mamluk Wars, and even later Egyptian–Ottoman War; while at the same time, Egypt used to support the Ottomans in various Ottoman wars. This backlash of relations between Egypt to the Ottoman Empire further developed with its own different view that would eventually escalate into 20th century under Gamal Abdel Nasser. Overall, Tunisia's relations with the Ottomans were deemed as good while Egypt's relations with the Ottomans were mostly complicated. In late 19th century, both Egypt and Tunisia fell to the hand of European colonizers, the British Empire and France. Both were heavily modernized and effectively became some of the most liberal Arab countries, but its treatments varied. However, anti-British and anti-French activities in Egypt and Tunisia were so great that it pushed the British and French to re- decide their positions over its colonies. Both countries suffered much at the World War II, being targeted by Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy; and also the turning points of the war started in both nations, notably the North African Campaign. ==Modern relations== With Tunisia became independence at 1956, Egypt and Tunisia established relations thanked for the efforts by Habib Bourguiba, who used to study in Egypt previously. Egypt and Tunisia maintained cordial relationship, with Egypt and Tunisia were in common front against Israel. However, after Anwar Sadat signed the Egypt–Israel Peace Treaty at 1973, relationship between two soured, though not directly, as Tunisia had refrained from engaging against Israel unlike Egypt prior to Sadat. It was not until late 1980s that saw Egypt and Tunisia restored tie, but Tunisia was able to maintain low-key relations with Egypt. In 1985, Israel launched Operation Wooden Leg, attacking Palestine Liberation Organization headquarter in Tunis, prompted angers from Tunisians. Egypt was one of these nations to condemn the attack, helped warming relations. After the end of Cold War, Egypt and Tunisia re-approached and became strategic partnership. ===Arab Spring=== The outbreak of the Arab Spring drew strong support from both Tunisians and Egyptians alike, since they were the two earliest Arab nations to be influenced by the revolution. Despite this however, only Tunisia was more successful in transforming into democracy; Egypt, on the other hand, saw a second change of regime and even more unrest, although it was able to fully avoid civil war unlike Syria, Yemen, Iraq and Libya. Despite the Spring, the two countries remain unsolved over its social issues. Radicalization of young people and Islamists alike, along with unstable economic conditions, have led to the two countries remaining corrupt even after the Spring. ==Cooperation== In 2019, Abdel Fattah el-Sisi announced strengthening of relations and anti-terrorism with Tunisia. Previously, two countries also signed 10 cooperation agreements in 2017. It was expected, in 2017, that the trade relationship between two would have a boost. There are educational exchanges between Egypt and Tunisia in many fronts. ==Diplomatic missions== *Egypt has an embassy in Tunis. *Tunisia has an embassy in Cairo. ==References== ==Further reading== *Egypt- Tunisia relations *A comparative historical analysis of the Ulama and the state in Egypt and Tunisia Tunisia Category:Bilateral relations of Tunisia ","title":"Egypt–Tunisia relations"},{"id":"60354622","text":"Nick Margevicius McDonnell, Andy. \\"Carpool Conversations: Nick Margevicius\\" (2018).

Held on Tuesday nights the upstairs room of The Crown on Station Street in Birmingham city centre, Henry's became known as the first progressive music club in the UK outside of London. The club featured a range of touring British and Irish rock bands who would later go on to gain worldwide recognition, including Status Quo, Thin Lizzy, Jethro Tull, and Judas Priest.In addition, future Led Zeppelin members Robert Plant and John Bonham were regulars at Henry's Blueshouse, and would often get on stage to jam with the booked performers. Henry's Blueshouse hosted a number of notable American bluesmen, including Champion Jack Dupree, Lightnin' Slim, Arthur Big Boy Crudup and Reverend Gary Davis. === Black Sabbath === One week, two members of the club, John \\"Ozzy\\" Osbourne and Tony Iommi, approached Simpson to ask if they could have a support slot for their recently formed band, Earth, at a future gig in exchange for four Henry's t-shirts. After auditioning for Simpson at the venue, they were booked to open for visiting band Ten Years After.Earth would go on to both perform regularly at Henry's Blueshouse and be managed by Simpson, changing their name to Black Sabbath.The band would go on to acknowledge this period as a formative one in their career, with Osbourne commenting \\"we were made by Jim Simpson\\", using their sets at the club to play in much of the early material on their eponymous debut album, widely acknowledged by publications such as Metal Hammer as the first recording in the heavy metal genre. == Closure and rebirth == By 1970, Simpson found his time more and consumed by his work managing Black Sabbath and other bands, and Henry's Blueshouse came to an end. The pub continued to trade, with the upstairs gig room being used intermittently for both discos and live music, including early gigs by Birmingham punks GBH.However, in the summer of 2014 then-owners Admiral Taverns sold The Crown to Japanese property developers, who evicted the then-licensee, leaving the building boarded up and closed to the public. Jim Simpson continued to work in the live music business as a promoter and artist manager. In March 2019 Big Bear Music relaunched Henry's Blueshouse, this time hosted at The Bulls Head on Bishopsgate Street, approximately one mile from the original venue, where it continues to present live blues every Tuesday night. == References == == External Links == * Henry's Blueshouse on Birmingham Music Archive * A partial list of bands that played Henry's Blueshouse * Information page for the current iteration of Henry's Blueshouse * Jim Simpson talks about the history of Henry's Blueshouse Category:Music venues in Birmingham, West Midlands Category:Black Sabbath ","title":"Henry's Blueshouse"},{"id":"60354996","text":"Legislative elections were held in New Caledonia on 22 December 1946 and 5 January 1947 to elect the 19 elected members of the General Council.Jean Le Borgne (2005) Nouvelle-Calédonie: 1945-1968 - La confiance trahie, Editions L'Harmattan, p20 The elections saw the left-wing members elected in 1945 largely replaced by members representing business and the mining industry.N.

She had two brothers Alfred (1896-1917) and Walter (1910-1994). Her father and her uncle Heinrich, managed the paper and paper bag factory in Wesel which had been founded by her grandfather Heinrich Berkenkamp in 1865. Lou Scheper-Berkenkamp graduated from elementary school, then attended a grammar school for four years and went on to attend the Viktoria-Schule in Essen, a girls' grammar school with progressive teaching. Through the art teacher Margarete Schall (1896-1939) her talent for colours and painting was discovered. Hermine Louise Berkenkamp originally wanted to study medicine or German philologie. But Margarete Schall, who herself later enrolled in the Bauhaus for a semester, suggested she study at the art school as it was known for its progressive teaching methods. == The Bauhaus period == Color Wheel Johannes Itten 1961Farbkreis (Color Wheel) nach Johannes Itten von (Alias) KagoBelcol youtube.com Farbkreis After graduating from high school in 1920, Lou Berkenkamp enrolled at the Bauhaus in Weimar and studied under Johannes Itten, Lyonel Feininger, Paul Klee and Georg Muche. She became acquainted with Hinnerk Scheper, a classmate in the mural painting workshop there and married him on December 24, 1922 in Weimar. Berkenkamp lived with her parents in Wesel during the first years of her marriage, with their son Jan Gisbert, born in November 1923. During this time the first pictures letters were created. In 1922 the couple left the Bauhaus Weimar and while Lou focused on her artistic work, Hinnerk Scheper worked as a colour designer. In 1925, he was called to the Bauhaus in Dessau as a master of the mural painting workshop at the Bauhaus Dessau. In 1926 their daughter Britta was born in Dessau. After Georg Muche, master woodcarver, left for Berlin in 1927, a semi-detached house became available and the Scheper family was able to move in. Lou Scheper-Berkenkamp worked - without matriculation - in the stage workshop of the Bauhaus under the direction of Oskar Schlemmer. Lou supported an important area of Schlemmer's work with the development of costumes, choreographies, sets and puppets for \\"Triadisches Ballett\\", premiere 1922 in Stuttgart, further developed by Oskar Schlemmer in 1926 with music by Hindemith. She designed and directed costumes and sets for the plays Ojdar“ and Circus and directed. In the group exhibition Junge Bauhausmaler (Young Bauhaus Painter), in Halle (Saale), she took 1928 part. She also created also a number of children's books until the couple's 1929 departure from Dessau. Family Scheper remained associated with the Bauhaus until its closure in 1933 and beyond. Triadisches Ballett by Oskar Schlemmer - Staatsgalerie - Stuttgart - Germany 2017.jpgFigurines of the Triadic Ballet at the Staatsgalerie Stuttgart Oskar Schlemmer Triadisches Ballett 100.jpgChoreography Triadic Ballet == Moscow 1929 to 1931 == Redeemer Tower of the Moscow Kremlin From July 1929 to August 1930 the Schepers followed a call to Moscow. Hinnerk Scheper, a specialist in colour design, was to set up a \\"Consultation Centre for Colour in Architecture and Cityscapes\\" (Russian Maljarstroj) for the entire Soviet Union. Together they worked on the colour plans. During this time Lou Scheper-Berkenkamp wrote articles for the German-language weekly Moskauer Rundschau (Moscow Review) In her contributions she captured the everyday life of people in the big city with an artistic hand and in a socially critical manner. In the service of her husband, she did not publish her own works in Moscow and supported Hinnerk in organizational problems. Inspired by the figures of the Triadic Ballet, she created collages of the basic forms circle, triangle and square. With her abstract work she critically opposed the standardization of architecture and the Soviet citizens. She painted Moscow's street life with ink and opaque colours. This resulted in ironic text and skillful picture designs. == The National Socialism period == Das Bauhaus, Dessau, DDR May 1990 (5288787560) After another shorter stay in Moscow in 1931, the Schepers returned to the Bauhaus in Dessau under the new director Ludwig Mies van der Rohe. When the Bauhaus moved in 1932, they also moved to the capital Berlin. Due to the worsening political situation in Germany in 1932, further cooperation with Soviet colleagues was no longer conceivable. The right-wing magistrate in Dessau, the leading faction in the city council since 1931, cut all funding for the Bauhaus. On October 1, 1932, the Bauhaus Dessau closed down involuntarily and under high political pressure. The building was used as the Gauführerschule of the NSDAP. Mies van der Rohe wanted to continue the Bauhaus in Berlin with his own funds under the title \\"Free Teaching and Research Institute\\" in the former Steglitz telephone factory, but the fascists forced him to close the institute on 20 July 1933. From then on, the teachers had to secure their livelihood with casual jobs. Some Bauhaus artists emigrated to Palestine and the USA. Since the closure of the Bauhaus in 1933, Lou Scheper-Berkenkamp worked as a freelance painter in Berlin. Between 1933 and 1945, Scheper-Berkenkamp designed a number of children's books, many of which were published following the Second World War by the publisher Ernst Wunderlich, Leipzig. Her son Dirk was born in Berlin in 1938. Lou accompanied Hinnerk on his \\"Norddeutsche Reportage-Reisen\\" and wrote texts for his various landscape photo series of landscapes. Repressions in 1934 against her husband Hinnerk, who was forbidden by the Nazis to join the Reich Association of German Photojournalists, also cut off this source of income for the family. So they concentrated on the colour design of public houses, murals and restoration work. Hinnerk Scheper did military service in Germany from 1942 to 1945. During this time, Lou provided for the family alone. She invented picture stories, which were not published as children's books until by Ernst Wunderlich Verlag in Leipzig. The family survived the war years in complete seclusion. == After World War II == Lou Scheper-Berkenkamp and her children Britta, Jan Giesbert, Dirk and her parents, whose house in Wesel was destroyed by the war, had experienced the end of the war in Badbergen. In 1945 the Berlin magistrate appointed Hinnerk Scheper as a monument conservator and state curator of Berlin and his wife supported him in his work. From now on she devoted herself again to her artistic work and looked for a way to publish children's books. In the publisher Ernst Wunderlich from Leipzig she found the right contact person, with the best technical possibilities of offset printing and a great supporter. House at the Waldsee,Berlin In 1950/51 she took part in \\"exhibitions of picture book originals\\". Her works were shown in \\"America Houses\\" in Kassel, Darmstadt, Frankfurt, Gießen, Marburg and Wiesbaden. These American institutions were established around 1950 in West Germany in the spirit of democratic educational work by the Allies. In the open, democratig and friendly atmosphere of these houses, Lou's timelessly artistic picture stories were able to unfold the narrative stream flow of their art. === \\"The Ring\\" 1951 Berlin Artists' Association Exhibitions and new projects === In 1951 Lou Scheper-Berkenkamp was one of the co-founders of the Berlin artists' association \\"The Ring\\", of which she was a member of the board until 1970.

Of Anglo-Dutch extraction, she was a wealthy heiress, possible early love interest of George Washington, and New York City socialite. Married to an ex-British army colonel, her Loyalist sympathies in the American Revolution reshaped her life. At the age of 22 she inherited one-third of her father's roughly \\"Highland Patent\\", which sprawled from the Hudson Highlands on the west bank of the lower Hudson River to the Connecticut Colony in the east. In 1758 she married in New York Englishman Roger Morris (January 1727 – September 1794), who had fought extensively in the French and Indian War. With Roger's appointment to the Governor’s Council of the Province of New York the couple became pillars of the local establishment. A year after their marriage Morris had a large country estate, Mount Morris, built in northern Manhattan between the Hudson and Harlem rivers in what is now Washington Heights. The family lived there until 1775. Roger fled to England at the onset of the Revolution, returning two years later. In 1779 the government of the Colony of New York seized both Morris' personal property and Mary's inheritances. Despite assurance of restitution in the 1783 Treaty of Paris Description of the Abstract of Sales, Commissioners of Forfeiture no compensation was forthcoming. The family relocated to England. It was later found that a provision in the couple's prenuptial agreement creating a life trust transferable to their children had protected her Highland Patent inheritance from the 1779 bill of attainder. In 1809 the Morris heirs finally received from American robber baron John Jacob Astor £20,000 sterling for their rights to the disputed lands. Mary died in York, England at the age of 96. A monument is erected over her grave at St Saviour’s Church there.Women of the American Revolution: Mary Philipse ==Highland inheritance== Map of the Philipse Patent showing the holdings of Philip, Susanna, and Mary Philipse Mary was, along with her elder brother Philip, older sister Susanna (1727–1822), and younger sister Margaret (1733-1752), a one-quarter heir to the roughly \\"Highland Patent\\" of her father (later to become known as the Philipse Patent, and in time today's Putnam County of southeastern New York). Margaret Philipse died intestate, and her share of the Patent was equally divided among her named living siblings. A redistribution of the land among them was done in 1754.French's Gazetteer of the State of New York (1860): “The Philipses Patent… divided among the remaining three [children] Philip… Susannah married to Beverly Robinson, and Mary married to Col. Roger Morris. On the 7th of Feb 1754, the patent was divided into 9 lots: 3, each 4 mi. square, bordering upon the Hudson and denominated ‘water lots;’ 3, each 4 mi. wide by 12 long, extending N. and S. across the patent, and denominated ‘long lots;’ 3, each 4 mi. square, upon the E. border denominated ‘back lots.’ Philip, Susannah and Mary Philipse each owned one of each kind of lots.\\" ==The Washington legend== Philipse Manor Hall in today's Getty Square neighborhood of Yonkers George Washington was a Colonel in service to the British Army during the French and Indian War, serving from 1753 to 1758. He was acquainted with Joseph Chew (b. 1725), a Colonial merchant and port surveyor in New London, Connecticut, through Chew's brother Colby, who served in Washington's Virginia Regiment. Chew was a friend of the Robinson and Philipse families. In early 1756 Washington had shared company with then retired Captain Beverley Robinson and his wife Susanna, Mary's elder sister. Mary, known as \\"Polly\\", had caught Washington's eye. In 1756-1757 Chew wrote several letters to him, which survive and begat the legend of a doomed Washington/Mary Philipse love. Washington's letters to Chew - or Polly - have never surfaced. Chew often stayed at the Philipse Manor house, the family seat on the Hudson in today's Yonkers, during his trips to Boston, and visited with Mary at the Robinson home on the Hudson in the Philipse Patent. Among his letters were the following passages: * 4 March 1756: \\"I have this moment a Letter from our Worthy friend B. Robinson, he, Mrs. Robinson, the agreeable Miss Polly and all his family are Very well.\\" * 14 March 1757: \\"I am now at Mr. Robinson’s, he, Mrs. Robinson and his Dear Little Family are all well and they desire their Compliments to you. Pretty Miss Polly is in the same Condition & situation as you saw her.\\" (\\"Condition & situation\\" refer to Mary’s alleged affections for Washington.) * 13 July 1757: \\"As to the Latter part of your Letter what shall I say? I often had the Pleasure of Breakfasting with the Charming Polly. Roger Morris was there (don’t be startled) but not always; you know he is a Lady’s man... \\" (Morris ultimately married Mary Philipse in January 1758.) * 13 July 1757: \\"I intend to set out tomorrow for New York where I will not be wanting to let Miss Polly know the sincere Regard a Friend of mine has for her and I am sure if she had my Eyes to see thro she would Prefer him to all others.\\" (The \\"Friend\\" being George Washington.) According to Washington biographer Douglas Southall Freeman, a match between George and Polly had been considered a possibility.Freeman, Douglas Southall. George Washington, Volume 2: Young Washington (1948) p. 160)Philipse Manor Hall State Historic Site and Museum website. Within a year of his mention Mary and Roger Morris were married. ==American Revolution== Mount Morris, today's Morris-Jumel Mansion, in the Washington Heights section of northern Manhattan. General George Washington used it as a headquarters during his defense of New York City in the American Revolution. Morris and his family lived in Mount Morris from 1765 until 1775, when the American Revolution began. A Loyalist, Morris went to England at the start of the war, while his wife and family stayed at the family Manor house in Yonkers.Morris-Jumel Mansion Interior Designation Report , New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission, 27 May 1975. Between 14 September – 20 October 1776, General George Washington used the Morris mansion as his temporary headquarters. There is no record of any communication during the war between Washington and Polly. Morris returned to New York in 1777, after the city had been captured by the British. In 1779, estates of 58 prominent Loyalists, including the Morris home and Mary's share of the Philipse Patent, were confiscated by the Commissioners of Forfeiture of the New York Colony. Despite assurance of restitution in the 1783 Treaty of Paris Description of the Abstract of Sales, Commissioners of Forfeiture compensation was not forthcoming. ==After the war== Mary Philipse Morris (undated) in Women of the American Revolution (1846) Before wedding, Philipse and Morris had signed a prenuptial agreement that shared a life lease of the estate between husband and wife, transferred to their children after their death. After the war it was subsequently shown in court that as a result the Morris share of the Philipse Patent was vested in their children and had not been reached by New York's bill of attainder.Philipse Manor Hall State Historic Site and Museum website Unfortunately, a resolution ground along for decades before progress was made. In 1809 America's first robber baron, John Jacob Astor, bought the interest of the Morris heirs, which included Polly, for this property for £20,000 sterling, then brought suit against the State to recover the lands - or at least the rents due upon them - from the former tenant farmers who had been able to acquire their holdings from the Colonial government of New York for a fraction of their value during the dark days of the Revolution when the Continental Army was desperate for funds.French's Gazetteer of the State of New York (1860) Astor's gambit failed, but the Morris family was able to retain his payment. It was not until 1832 that Astor was paid some $561,000 by the state of New York to drop his claims. ==Family== The Morrises had two sons and two daughters. Sons Amherst and Henry Gage both served in the Royal Navy, as a lieutenant and rear-admiral, respectively. ==See also== * Philipse family * Philipse Patent * Dutchess County Land Patents * The Oblong ==ReferencesPutnam's Past * Boundary Changes of Putnam County Category:1730 births Category:1825 deaths Category:American members of the Dutch Reformed Church Category:American people of Dutch descent Category:People of colonial New York Mary ","title":"Mary Philipse"},{"id":"60355350","text":"Daxing Township () is a township under the administration of Heishan County, Liaoning, China. , it has eight villages under its administration. == References == Category:Township-level divisions of Liaoning Category:Heishan County ","title":"Daxing Township, Heishan County"},{"id":"60355354","text":"Map of the Philipse Patent showing the holdings of Philip, Susanna, and Mary Philipse Susanna Philipse (also \\"Susannah\\", 8 September 1727 – 22 November 1822) was the eldest surviving daughter of Frederick Philipse II, 2nd Lord of Philipsburg Manor of Westchester County, New York. She was, along with her elder brother Philip and younger sisters Mary (1730–1825), and Margaret (1733-1752), a one-quarter heir to the roughly \\"Highland Patent\\" of her father (later to become known as the Philipse Patent, and in time today's Putnam County of southeastern New York). Susanna was married to Beverley Robinson, a soldier from a prominent family in the Colony of Virginia who had relocated to the Province of New York. He was a childhood friend of future American general and statesman George Washington, who was for a time during the French and Indian War an irregular guest at their home on Susanna's land on the east bank of the Hudson. It is there Washington is said to have developed an attraction to Susanna's younger sister Mary. During the Revolution Susanna's lands and the Robinson family fortune were confiscated by the rebel government of the New York Colony. Their home became the headquarters of soon to turn treasonous Continental Army general Benedict Arnold. During an extended stay there by Washington Arnold's plans were revealed through the capture of British spymaster Major John Andre. Following his trial and sentencing Beverley Robinson was sent to Washington to plead for Andre's wife. Washington refused to see him. Following the war the Robinsons relocated to Southwest England, where in time they received a partial payment for their seized properties. Both died and were interred there. ==Marriage== On 7 July 1748, she married then-Captain Beverley Robinson, a soldier from a prominent family in the Colony of Virginia, in Trinity Church, New York City.Gentleman's Magazine, Beverley Robinson, February 1852 pp 188–190 Robinson had personally raised a company of troops there in 1745 and relocated it to the Province of New York to defend that state's frontier against Indian attack.Loyal American Regiment: Beverley Robinson The couple went on have at least five children, four boys and a girl, including Beverley Honorable Robinson (1754–1816), Morris (1759-1815), Susanna Maria Robinson (1760–1833), John Robinson (1761–1828), and Frederick Philipse Robinson (1763-1852). ==Inheritance== Margaret Philipse died intestate in 1752, and her share of the Highland Patent was equally divided among her named living siblings. A redistribution of the land among them was done in 1754.French's Gazetteer of the State of New York (1860): “The Philipses Patent… divided among the remaining three [children] Philip… Susannah married to Beverly Robinson, and Mary married to Col. Roger Morris. On the 7th of Feb 1754, the patent was divided into 9 lots: 3, each 4 mi. square, bordering upon the Hudson and denominated ‘water lots;’ 3, each 4 mi. wide by 12 long, extending N. and S. across the patent, and denominated ‘long lots;’ 3, each 4 mi. square, upon the E. border denominated ‘back lots.’ Philip, Susannah and Mary Philipse each owned one of each kind of lots.\\" Susanna's eldest brother, Frederick Philipse III (1720–1785), inherited the family's vast hereditary estate in lower Westchester County, New York, Philipsburg Manor, and was its third and last Lord. Upon Susanna's inheritance of her interest in the Patent, the Robinsons settled on her land, gradually renting parcels to tenant farmers. It was a pleasant life, though Susanna's plots were only lightly settled and lacked the commerce and industry of her eldest brother's Manor. ==American Revolution== With the onset of the American Revolutionary War Beverley sought to remain uninvolved, but in time relented. In 1777, he formed the Loyal American Regiment, which proved a very active Loyalist force in that conflict. In addition to serving as its Colonel and commander through the British defeat 1783, he was known for his work with the British secret service during the war, particularly in regards to the betrayal of Continental general Benedict Arnold in the André Affair.

Since 1988 the studio has worked on projects for more than 30 wineries, which have been disseminated in national and international media, and several have received awards. Bórmida combines her activity at the studio with academic pursuits, developing an extensive career in the field of heritage preservation. In 2012 she received the Konex Award for Architecture. ==Early years== In childhood, Eliana Bórmida became interested in the humanities, art, drawing, and reading. She studied at a normal high school and was determined to study philosophy. When she was in high school she traveled to Chicago on an exchange scholarship, and there she became interested in architecture when she met an architect, a relative of the family that she was staying with. When she returned home, Bórmida enrolled in the University of Mendoza's recently inaugurated Faculty of Architecture. This was directed by and had professors from Córdoba, Santa Fe, and San Juan who promoted the modern movement and an integral way of understanding design. She graduated in 1972. Her classmate Mario Yanzón later became her partner and husband. ==Career== Bodega Séptima Bodega Salentein Bodegas Diamandes Bodega O Fournier Bórmida and Yanzón formed an eponymous studio whose projects are led by both of them. After their divorce, the associates continued working together in the same arrangement. One of their daughters, Luisa Yanzón, is an architect and also works for the studio doing interior design. Bórmida's works are based on an integrative conceptualization of architecture and context, understood as a natural and cultural landscape, which seeks to give architecture a transcendent support and projection, to contribute to regional identity. Her experience comes from professional practice and also from university teaching and research. She has been a Professor Emeritus at the University of Mendoza since 2011, where she was Associate Professor of History of Architecture and Urban Planning from 1973 to 2005 and founder and director of the Institute of Architectural and Urban Culture. Alberto Nicolini worked with her to consolidate the institute, which was something exceptional in a private university. There she developed themes of cultural heritage and Andean regional identity and initiated a line of research on Cultural Heritage of Wine in Mendoza. She was called on by the Regional Government of Andalusia to edit, together with Graciela Moretti, an architectural guide for Mendoza. From 1995 to 2003 she was a delegate of the National Commission of Museums and of Monuments and Historical Places (CNMMyLH) and of the International Council on Monuments and Sites (ICOMOS) Argentina. Bórmida started on this track early in her career when she participated in the meetings organized by the Institute of History coordinated by Marina Waisman, a pioneer in the field in Argentina. In 2007 she was recognized by the Office of the President of Italy with the Order of the Star of Italian Solidarity. In 2014 she was declared an illustrious citizen of the city of Mendoza.

The BGT is used for a variety of research applications, particularly those that benefit from specially tailored positron gases, plasmas and/or pulsed beams. 450x450px 250x250px ==Design and operation== The schematic design of a BGT is illustrated in Fig. 1. It consists of a specially designed (Penning or Penning–Malmberg) type electromagnetic trap. Positrons are confined in a vacuum inside an electrode structure consisting of a stack of hollow, cylindrical metal electrodes such as that shown in Fig. 2. A uniform axial magnetic field inhibits positron motion radially, and voltages imposed on end electrodes prevent axial loss. Such traps are renowned for their good confinement properties for particles (such as positrons) of a single sign of charge. Given a trap designed for good confinement, a remaining challenge is to efficiently fill the device. In the BGT, this is accomplished using a series of inelastic collisions with a molecular gas. In a positron-molecule collision, annihilation is much less probable than energy loss due to electronic or vibrational excitation. The BGT has a stepped potential well (Fig. 1) with regions at successively lower gas pressure. Electronic excitation of molecular nitrogen (N2) in the highest- pressure region is used to trap the positrons. This process is repeats until the particles are in a sufficiently low-pressure environment and the annihilation time is acceptably long. The particles cool to the ambient gas temperature due to inelastic vibrational and rotational collisions. Trap efficiency is typically 5 – 30%, but can be as much as 40%. Positronium (Ps) formation via charge-exchange (e.g., e+\\\\+ N2-> N2+\\\\+ Ps) is a major loss process. Molecular nitrogen is used because it is unique in having an electronic energy level below the threshold for Ps formation; hence it is the trapping gas of choice. Similarly, carbon tetrafluoride (CF4) and sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) have very large vibrational excitation cross sections, and so these gases are used for cooling to the ambient temperature (typically ~ 300 K). While most positron sources produce positrons with energies ranging from a few kiloelectronvolts (keV) to more than 500 keV, the BGT is only useful for much lower energy particles (i.e. less than or equal to tens of electronvolts). Thus, high-energy positrons from such sources are injected into the surfaces of materials (so-called positron moderators) in which they lose energy, diffuse to the surface, and are re-emitted with electronvolt energies. The moderator of choice for the BGT is solid neon (~ 1% conversion efficiency ), frozen on a cold metal surface. The lifetime in the final trapping stage is limited by annihilation and is typically less than or equal to 100 seconds, which limits the total number of trapped positrons. If larger particle numbers are desired, the positrons are transferred to an ultra-high vacuum (UHV) Penning–Malmberg trap in a several Tesla magnetic field. Annihilation is negligible in UHV. Positron cooling (necessary to combat heating due to extrinsic effects) is now due to the emission of cyclotron radiation in the large magnetic field. This accumulation and transfer process can then be repeated to build up larger collections of antimatter. ==History and uses== The BGT was invented in the 1980s, originally intended to study positron transport in tokamak (fusion) plasmas. Subsequently, the technique was refined and is now used in laboratories worldwide for a variety of applications. They include study of positron interactions with atoms and molecules, materials, and material surfaces; the creation of antihydrogen, the positronium molecule (i.e., Ps2, e+e−e+e−), and novel positron and positronium beams. BGTs are also expected to play similarly important roles in efforts to create and study positoronium atom Bose–Einstein condensates (BEC) and a classical electron-positron “pair” plasmas. ==See also== *Penning trap * Non- neutral plasmas * Positron annihilation ==References== Category:Particle physics Category:Particle traps ","title":"Buffer-gas trap"},{"id":"60355567","text":"Betty (c. 1738 – 1795) was a biracial enslaved woman owned by Martha Washington. She was owned by the Custis Estate and worked at Daniel Parke Custis' plantation, the White House, on the Pamunkey River in New Kent County, Virginia. Custis married Martha Dandridge (Washington) in 1750 and, when he died in 1757, Betty became one of Martha's dower slaves whom she brought to George Washington's plantation, Mount Vernon, after the Washington marriage in 1759. Betty worked at Mount Vernon until she died. Betty was the mother of Ona Judge, who escaped from the Washingtons. Betty worked as a seamstress both at the White House and Mount Vernon plantations. Her story exemplifies the sexual vulnerability that enslaved women faced. == Early life == Betty was of mixed European and African heritage. Since Betty was born enslaved, her mother would have been of African descent as slavery was inherited through the mother per the law of partus sequitur ventrem. As Betty's mother had a child with a white man, her mother was most likely a slave in the domestic sphere, as that occupation would have caused Betty's mother to be in close proximity to white men. Betty was born circa 1738 and spent her childhood cared for by someone besides her mother as enslaved parents worked sunup to sundown and only had time with their children at night. Enslaved children younger than twelve did not work with their parents and did not yet have specified occupations. Instead, their owners had them do chores, like collecting water and firewood, or taking care of younger enslaved children. Because enslaved children did not typically work as long as adults, they did not receive shoes or blankets, and were often forced to share blankets with their family members. Enslaved children were also given less than the normal food ration and often helped to grow gardens so their family could have more food than just the meager rations they were provided. As with many other slaves, Betty likely only had one set of clothes for the whole year. Children like Betty were given shifts to wear. == Life at the Custis Plantation == By the time she was a pre-adolescent, around 11-14 years old, Betty trained to be a seamstress, a skilled occupation that gave her a higher status among the enslaved workforce at the White House. Betty started work before sunrise and ended work after the sun went down. Slaves working in the domestic sphere, like seamstresses, were often biracial. As a seamstress, Betty was not only tasked with making clothes for her master and his family, but also for other enslaved people on the plantation. The master and his families' clothes would have been made with materials like silk, cotton, or anything that the master could afford, while slaves' clothes tended to be made from linen or wool, which were much cheaper materials. Betty would also have been tasked with repairing clothes of both the enslaved people and her master and his family. As an enslaved domestic worker, Betty worked closely with Martha Custis (Washington) both at the White House plantation and at Mount Vernon. Betty was one of Martha's favorite slaves and while working at the White House, \\"Betty watched... [Martha Washington] survive the sudden loss of her first husband\\" and two of her four children. She also saw her meet and marry George Washington. While working at the Custis plantation, Betty gave birth to her first child, Austin, at the age of nineteen in 1757. Austin's father is unknown, but it is likely that his father was white as Austin was reported to have lighter skin. Since lighter skin was favored for domestic occupations, Austin worked as a waiter for the Washingtons. == Move to Mount Vernon == Daniel Parke Custis died in 1757, leaving Martha Custis a very rich widow. As part of Martha's widow dower share she received 84 slaves from the Custis estate. Scholar Erica Dunbar notes that the death of an owner would have made 21-year-old Betty nervous, as slaves were often sold and families separated in order to pay off any outstanding debts their owner may have had. Luckily for Betty, she and her two-year-old son, Austin, were not separated and Martha Washington picked both of them to go to Mount Vernon with her in 1759. At the time of Betty's and Austin's move to Mount Vernon, together the two of them were worth sixty pounds. Eventually a total of 155 slaves from the Custis estate were brought to Mount Vernon. Dunbar notes that Betty's anxieties would not have subsided with her move to the new Virginia plantation, as she was likely nervous about the sexual vulnerability she faced with her new owner. Dunbar writes that at 21, Betty was the perfect age for childbearing and she did not know how Washington would treat her. It was never recorded that George Washington sexually abused any of his slaves, but Betty was still vulnerable to exploitation by other men at Mount Vernon, as well as at the White House plantation. == Life at Mount Vernon == The Mansion House at the Mount Vernon Estate At Mount Vernon, Betty was part of the 6% mixed race (of mixed European and African descent) population at the plantation. Betty spent her entire day working primarily as a seamstress and spinner, but she also cooked and cleaned. Since Betty worked at the Mansion House, the domestic part of the estate, she was likely to be seen by visitors and so she was clothed better than her enslaved field working counterparts. Betty wore simple, ankle-length dresses that were made out of cheaper material, like linen or wool. Betty also had an apron, cap, stockings, and shoes. As a seamstress, like at the White House plantation, Betty was tasked with making clothes for her owners as well as for other slaves. She would make clothing for enslaved individuals, mostly out of linen and wool, according to the clothing ration Washington allocated for his enslaved people. Each week, Betty had to make a certain percentage of clothes or she would have been punished. During her time at Mount Vernon, it is not exactly clear where Betty lived. She possibly lived in a log cabin or in a brick building, called the \\"House of Families,\\" which was the predominant slave quarter at the Mansion House., 86. Domestic slaves were kept close to the Washingtons' home and Betty's possible living space was only 300 feet away. Only skilled, domestic slaves lived at the \\"House of Families,\\" and it was located on \\"the north lane of outbuildings, directly across from the blacksmiths' shop.\\" It was two stories tall and had chimneys. From archaeological evidence, it appears that slaves living at the \\"House of Families\\" cooked \\"one-pot meals\\" that consisted of low-grade meat and cornmeal, as well as any vegetables or fruits that they had grown in their gardens. Washington only provided his enslaved people rations of pork and cornmeal. In 1792–1793, the \\"House of Families\\" was destroyed. It was replaced with one-story quarters built next to where the \\"House of Families\\" used to be. These new quarters were 2,800 square feet and held sixty people in four rooms. Each room had one fireplace, one door, and some kind of bunk beds. Washington built these new quarters so that he could keep a closer eye on his enslaved people. The housing situation at Mount Vernon reveals a hierarchy, as slaves were housed according to their occupation. Skilled slaves tended to be housed in brick buildings at the Mansion House, while field workers were instead housed in log or wood cabins at the different farms in which they worked. Mount Vernon consisted of five farms. While at Mount Vernon, Betty had four more children: Tom Davis (born 1769), Betty Davis (born 1771), Ona Judge (born 1774 and died 1848), and Philadelphia (born 1780 and died 1831). Tom and Betty were the children of Thomas Davis, a white man who worked at Mount Vernon as a weaver. Ona Judge was the daughter of Andrew Judge who was from England. Philadelphia's father is unknown, but in 1807 she was freed from slavery and married William Costin, an abolitionist and free man, who was the son of an enslaved woman, Ann Dandridge, and whose father was possibly John Parke Custis, Martha Washington's son. While Betty had five children total, as a slave she would have been separated from her children for most of the day. Betty also had \\"little control... over the lives of...[her] children.\\" Austin and Ona were selected by George and Martha Washington to accompany them to New York and Philadelphia after Washington was elected President. There was nothing Betty could do about this, and her children were forced to be separated from her because they were Martha Washington's property and she could do whatever she wanted with them. Every child Betty had enriched the Washingtons' and the Custis Estate, as children and young adults provided more enslaved labor.Morgan, Jennifer L. (Jennifer Lyle) (2004). Laboring Women: Reproduction and gender in New World slavery. Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press. p. 119, 167. . . The number of children that Betty had and the varying white fathers may illustrate the sexual vulnerability that enslaved women faced, especially when they worked in the domestic sphere, which put them in close proximity to many white men, not just their owner. (See, for example, the biographies of Alice Clifton, Jane the Runaway, Bridge Town, and Winney Grimshaw.) == Relationship with Andrew Judge == Andrew Judge, the father of Betty's daughter, Ona, came to the colonies in 1772 from England as an indentured servant. Washington bought Judge's labor, and Judge worked as a tailor at Mount Vernon. Betty was around 34 years old when Judge arrived at Mount Vernon and she likely met him due to the work that they both did with textiles and tailoring. Judge eventually worked off his indentured servitude and left Mount Vernon in the 1780s. We do not know if their relationship was consensual. == Later life and death == Slave Cemetery at George Washington's Mount Vernon. Likely Betty's final resting place. While her children Austin and Ona where working in Philadelphia, Betty labored at Mount Vernon. She became a grandmother to eighteen grandchildren. However, tragedy struck in 1794 when her son, Austin, drowned while traveling back to Virginia from Philadelphia. Erica Dunbar states that this \\"news was too much for Austin's mother [Betty] to bear.\\" Betty at this point was fatigued by her lifelong work as a slave and had been sick. She eventually died at Mount Vernon in 1795, around 57 years old. Of her death George Washington said \\"It is happy for old Betty, and her children and friends, that she is taken of[f] the stage; her life must have been miserable to herself, and troublesome to all those around her.\\" Betty never escaped the bonds of slavery and labored at the White House plantation and Mount Vernon for her entire life. However, two of her daughters, Ona Judge Staines and Philadelphia Costin, did escape their bonds and lived out their lives as free women of color. == References == Category:18th-century American slaves Category:George Washington ","title":"Betty (slave)"},{"id":"60355569","text":"Valmiki Choudhary is an Indian politician.

One researcher suggests it can be seen as both propaganda and literature. The work has received little critical attention since it was published. Another reviewer suggests it be seen as a work of historical fantasy, based on \\"current events and the chauvinism of World War I\\", not written in Leacock's usual nonsensical style but as a work of \\"rancorous satire\\". The stories feature stereotypical immigrant character types, \\"women adhered to their husbands' beliefs that it was a 'woman's lot to bear and to suffer. A German language version of the book was published in 1989, as Die Hohenzollern in Amerika und andere Satiren (The Hohenzollern[s] in America and other Satires). ==References== Category:1919 books Category:Books by Stephen Leacock ","title":"The Hohenzollerns in America"},{"id":"60355614","text":"Masindi–Biso Road is a road in the Western Region of Uganda, connecting the city of Masindi, in Masindi District and the town of Biso, in Buliisa District in the oil-rich Albertine Graben. ==Location== The road starts at Masindi, the district capital and the largest city in Masindi District.

It is situated alongside East Service Road of the North Luzon Expressway at its junction with Paso de Blas Road at the Malinta Interchange, and opposite Puregold Paso de Blas. Nearby landmarks include the Malinta Market and the former Plastic City manufacturing estate being redeveloped by Ayala Land into a mixed-use urban complex. ==History== The Valenzuela terminal started its interim operation on August 15, 2018. A provincial bus ban on EDSA was announced earlier in the month with the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA) announcing that nine bus companies serving the provinces of Bataan, Bulacan, Pampanga, Zambales, Pangasinan, Baguio, Ilocos Sur and Cagayan Valley and 1,954 buses would be accommodated at the new terminal. The terminal is part of a traffic reduction plan by MMDA that aims to free up the busy highway of some 2,276 northbound provincial buses. The plan also includes building two other provincial bus terminals in the south of the region for southbound provincial buses and the eventual closure of all 46 bus terminals on EDSA. The ban on provincial buses along EDSA was deferred until the completion of certain facilities and infrastructure at the Valenzuela terminal. The House of Representatives of the Philippines also expressed its concern over the designation of the Valenzuela terminal as Metro Manila's northern terminal citing its limited space, lack of infrastructure, and narrow streets, among others.

Captain George Scott was given charge of the ship in June 1807. ==Napoleonic Wars== Horatio was soon deployed to take part in the West Indies Campaign as part of the ongoing Napoleonic Wars. ===Capture of Junon=== On the morning of 10 February 1809, Horatio along with the sloop came upon the French frigate pursuing a British brig-of-war () about north of Anguilla. Under the command of George Scott, Horatio engaged in battle the 44-gun Junon, commanded by Augustin Rousseau. The French frigate aimed above Horatios decks, destroying its masts and rigging and causing many injuries, including to Captain Scott, who was incapacitated by a grape-shot blast to the shoulder, and to his first lieutenant, Manley Hall Dixon. Lieutenant George Douglas took over command for the rest of the 95-minute battle, at which point the badly damaged Junon attempted to flee. At this point the brig Superieure and frigate arrived in the area and joined the battle. After a short exchange of fire with Latona, Junon surrendered. In the engagement seven sailors on Horatio were killed and 26 wounded (17 of them seriously). On Latona there were six minor injuries. Thomas Colville, a seaman on Driver, was also badly injured. Scott described the British loss as \\"by no means Considerable\\" in relation to the \\"dreadful loss of the Enemy\\" suffered by the 323-man crew of Junon. He counted 130 French sailors killed and wounded, including Rousseau, who died shortly afterwards. The hull of Horatio suffered only minor damage, but the masts and rigging were essentially destroyed. In contrast, the hull of Junon was \\"most wonderfully cut up\\" and took on a great deal of water until the shot holes were patched. The heroism of the crew of Horatio was recognized in 1847 when the Navy issued as clasp to the Naval General Service Medal inscribed \\"Horatio 10 Feby. 1809\\". Thirteen surviving crew members from Horatio received this clasp. ===Later action during the Napoleonic Wars=== A year later, on 21 February 1810, still apparently under Scott's command, Horatio gave chase to Necessité, followed by an hour's \\"running action\\" resulting in the capture of the French ship without injuries on either side. Necessité, which was built as a 40-gun ship but only carried 28 guns at the time, had a crew of 186 men and was carrying a cargo of naval stores and provisions from Brest to Mauritius. Scott later went on to become captain of , but was forced to resign in 1814 due to pain from the injuries he received during the battle with Junon. ==War of 1812== By 1812, Horatio was under the command of Captain Lord George Stuart. On 2 August, boats from the frigate captured two Danish vessels, under the command of Lieutenant Hans Buderhof, and their prize, an American vessel of about 400 tons burthen (bm). The two Danish vessels were schooner No. 114 (with six 6-pounders and 30 men), and cutter No. 97 (with four 6-pounders and 22 men). Nine men from Horatio were killed and 16 wounded, of whom two died later; the Danes lost ten men killed and 13 wounded. In 1813, Horatio was in Buenos Aires under the command of Captain Joshua Percy, the younger son of the Duke of Northumberland. This is where George Pegler, an English boy of about 14 joined the crew, having escaped from the crew of a merchant ship. Leaving, Buenos Aires, Horatio anchored for a while off the coast of Montevideo, near Isla de Flores, which the crew named Seal Island for the vast numbers of South American fur seals. Parties of 100 or more sailors from Horatio would land on the island every day to hunt the seals. After this, the frigate sailed for Rio de Janeiro and Portsmouth. On 19 May 1814, Horatio arrived in Barbados from Bermuda along with a squadron of seven other British warships. On 2 June, it was in Halifax, Nova Scotia, having reportedly arrived from Cork and Newfoundland. The ship's voyages in the period from 12 August 1814 to 10 January 1816 are known in some detail due to the discovery of the illustrated logbook of midshipman John Smith Gould. During this period Horatio travelled to and painted Funchal, Madeira, the Ascension Islands, St. Helena, the Cape of Good Hope, Madras, Malacca, Singapore, Manilla, Macao, Ansons Bay and Rio de Janeiro. The log contains watercolours of icebergs that Gould called \\"ice islands\\" and pre- and post-eruption views of a volcano. ==Later service== Drawing of the iron mast step (support) fitted to former frigates Horatio and Eurotas as part of their conversion to steam-powered guard-ships in 1845–46. The ship spent 1816 in the East Indies, with calls at ports in India and China. At the end of 1816, Horatio was ordered home, and paid off at the beginning of 1817. The following year, the ship remained out of commission at Deptford. Horatio underwent major repairs at Deptford Dockyard between 1817 and 1819, under the direction of the yard's master shipwright, William Stone. Many frames were replaced with new timber or reused timbers taken from other ships. In late 1845 and early 1846, plans were drawn up to convert Horatio and to become steam-powered screw-driven guard ships. Some sources suggest that the actual conversion work was performed at Chatham Dockyard in 1850, with Horatio being the first screw-driven frigate launched from that yard. After its conversion Horatio was posted to Sheerness. Following the outbreak of the Crimean War in 1854, the navy revived the concept of the bomb vessel. As well as powered and unpowered newly built craft, in 1855 the navy earmarked four old sailing frigates that had recently been converted to screw propulsion to also be fitted with mortars: Horatio and Eurotas, plus the later frigates and .

On 5 July 2019, a wooden statue carved out of a tree trunk with a chainsaw was unveiled by the Sava river in Rožno, near Trump's hometown Sevnica in Slovenia. The artwork was commissioned by U.S. artist Brad Downey, who hired a local craftsman and artist Aleš Župevc (aka Maxi) to create the statue. The statue is styled after the blue dress she wore during her husband's (Donald Trump) presidential inauguration in 2017.

In order for Johnson to have actually killed Boyd, he would have needed to leave an apartment party, travel three miles to commit the murder, and return to the apartment on foot all within the span of five minutes. While this is beyond the realm of possibility, Johnson's case was doomed by investigative fabrication, perjured testimony, the suppression of exculpatory evidence, and an unreliable jailhouse informant. One of the men responsible for his conviction was lead detective Joseph Nickerson, who falsified four witness statements and even offered a man a $4,000 bribe to identify Johnson as the killer. St. Louis Circuit Attorney Kim Gardner, who stands by Johnson's innocence, filed a motion for a new trial in July 2019. Circuit Judge Elizabeth B. Hogan ruled against the motion just one month later, saying that it was 24 years too late. Hogan stood by a court rule that only allowed for a motion for a new trial to be scheduled within 15 days of a conviction. == See also == * List of wrongful convictions in the United States * Innocence Project * Innocence Network == External links == * Homepage * https://themip.org/clients/lamarjohnson/ == References == Category:People wrongfully convicted of murder Category:Overturned convictions in the United States Category:Crime in Maryland Category:People from Maryland ","title":"Lamar Johnson (wrongful conviction)"},{"id":"60355938","text":"Ernest Fernando (born 26 October 1938) is a Sri Lankan wrestler.

He now currently works for the Carnegie Institution of Science and is an active member of the NASA Astrobiology Institute. == Research == Steele’s research focuses on the detection of microbial life on Mars. He creates instrument and mission concepts for Mars missions. Steele uses a technique called “high-resolution confocal Raman imaging,” which is used to analyze samples collected during missions. He and his team used this technique to analyze samples from Mars in 2012 and identified hydrocarbons, which are important for organic chemistry reactions and play key roles in the creation of life. By studying these hydrocarbons, Steele was able to prove that the hydrocarbons did not come from biological origins, but rather from volcanic activity on Mars. Steele is currently investigating a new Martian meteorite, which contains more water than any other Martian meteorite found before, as well as hydrocarbons. Similar to his 2012 discovery, Steele was able to determine that the hydrocarbons did not result from contamination, but from a non-biological process, helping to answer important questions about the origin of life. Collectively, his investigations have helped inform discussion about thee potential habitability of Mars. == Awards == In 2012, the Royal Society of London awarded Steele the Wolfson Professorial Award. == References == == External links == *Andrew Steele Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Living people Category:Alumni of the University of Central Lancashire Category:Astrobiologists ","title":"Andrew Steele (astrobiologist)"},{"id":"60355975","text":"Target, or TARG, was an action video game written by Steve Dompier for the VDM-1 video card for S-100 bus microcomputers. It is among the earliest computer video games, released some time in 1976 or 1977. The game used the VDM-1's graphics characters in a game that Dompier described as a \\"shoot the airplanes sort of game\\". The player had a gun that could be rotated left and right, firing at targets moving sideways across the top of the screen. Target is almost certainly the first microcomputer game to be shown on national television. It appeared in late 1976 on The Tomorrow Show, mesmerizing the host Tom Snyder to the point where he had to be forced to stop playing it in order to finish the episode. ==Gameplay== Target puts the user in control of a missile base centered at the bottom of the screen. The keyboard is used to tilt the launcher to the left and right to angle it. A single missile can be on the screen at any time, and they can be moved left and right after firing, using the same controls. Enemy \\"spaceships\\" enter near the top of the screen travelling to the left or right. There are three types of enemy ships, large cargo ships worth 100 points, smaller scout ships worth 200, and parachutes that appear when two enemies collide, worth 600. When ships are hit, they blow up and fall to the ground, during which time they may hit other spaceships and destroy them as well. There are bonuses for destroying more than one ship with a single missile. The score is reduced by 20 when a ship escapes without being destroyed, or 30 when a missile flies off the top of the screen without hitting anything.

Nebraskanic acid was identified as a major component of the seed oil of Chinese violet cress (Orychophragmus violaceus L. O.E.Schulz). This fatty acid also occurs in Chinese violet cress oil with a second 24-carbon dihydroxy fatty acid wuhanic acid [(7R,15Z,18R,21Z)-7,18-dihydroxytetracosa-15,21-dienoic acid]. Nebraskanic and wuhanic acids were named in recognition of the location of their co- discoverers at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln and Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan, Hubei, China. == Biosynthesis == Discontinuous fatty acid elongation pathway for nebraskanic acid biosynthesis. The proposed biosynthetic pathway of nebraskanic acid is based on biochemical and genetic data obtained from Chinese violet cress seeds. These data are consistent with a biosynthetic pathway that originates from the 12-hydroxylation of oleoyl-CoA by a variant fatty acid desaturase 2 (FAD2) enzyme, followed by partial elongation to a C20 3-OH-CoA intermediate. This intermediate is pulled from the elongation cycle through a process termed \\"discontinuos elongation\\" by a variant 3-keotacyl-CoA synthetase or FAE1 and elongated through a continuous or complete cycle. The resulting C22 5-OH fatty acyl-CoA then goes through a continuous elongation cycle that results in the hydroxyl group at the C-7 carbon of the 24-carbon fatty acid chain. This pathway for the biosynthesis of the C-7 hydroxyl group of nebraskanic acid is conceptually similar to the anaerobic pathway for fatty acid desaturation in bacteria. This pathway is genetically supported by the reconstruction of nebraskanic acid synthesis in Arabidopsis seeds by co-expression of a 12-fatty acid hydroxylase gene and a variant FAE1 gene from Orychophragmus violaceus. == Functionality == Tribology tests of nebraskanic acid- and wuhanic acid-rich Chinese violet cress oil conducted in the BioDiscovery Institute at the University of North Texas showed that this oil has superior high temperature lubricant properties compared to castor oil for metal-on-metal wear at 100 °C. It was speculated that the hydroxyl groups of nebraskanic acid and wuhanic acid allow formation of additional fatty acid esters or estolides on the triacylglycerol molecules in Chinese violet cress oil. ==References== Category:Fatty acids Category:Diols ","title":"Nebraskanic acid"},{"id":"60356014","text":"Joiri Minaya (born 1990) is a Dominican-American artist based in New York City.

Originally planned as a remake of the 2005 video game Pathologic, it has been set to be a complete reimagining of the original game. The game is planned to be released in three parts, each one dedicated to the story of one of the three main characters. The first part telling the story of the Haruspex was released 23 May 2019.Pathologic 2 - Release Date Trailer  Children of Gorkhon A playable demo (released on 2 December 2016) called \\"The Marble Nest\\" with its own short story is freely available on the internet, as well as an alpha build which was released on 11 September 2018. Another playable demo was released on 24 April 2019, one month prior to the release of the first part of the game.Pathologic 2 demo live  Steam Community == Plot == Pathologic 2 consists of many separate quests and points of interest which are not necessarily linear in nature. It is therefore possible that a player will not encounter some of the events described in this synopsis, or that they will encounter these events in a different order to that listed here. The protagonist of the game is a surgeon named Artemy Burakh, also known as the Haruspex. The game begins at the end of a previous, seemingly failed run, on 'day 12'. The town is nearly empty, filled with bodies and the sounds of screaming. Artemy speaks to various characters and eventually makes his way to the Cathedral, where he is able to speak to the mysterious theatre manager, Mark Immortell, and request a 'second attempt'. This is granted, and time resets to Artemy on a train, travelling to the Town. The player controls Artemy through a series of strange dreams and visions, ultimately culminating in the game beginning for real. Through dialogue with a character known as the 'Fellow Traveller', it is revealed that Artemy was born and raised in the town but has not been back in many years. His father, Isidor Burakh, is the local physician and a leading member of the Kin, the native inhabitants of the steppe. He sent Artemy to the capital as a teenager to gain an education in medicine, but has now requested that he return, stating that 'great difficulties' are coming. Upon arriving in the town, Artemy is greeted by three locals who try to kill him. In a cutscene, he kills the attackers. Nearby strangers in plague doctor suits tell him that the locals suspect him of killing an important resident of the town and that the attack on him was an act of revenge. It is soon revealed that, in fact, two people have seemingly been murdered. The first is Simon Kain, a prominent leader of the town and a man who had previously been assumed to be immortal; the second is Isidor. Artemy is suspected of patricide and attacked by many of the townspeople, who have been driven to unusual violence by the recent events. Young women are targeted in particular due to old steppe legends of a 'Shabnak-adyr', a creature with clay legs who brings death. A local gang of children known as the 'Soul-And-A-Halves' request Artemy's assistance with finding a boy who poisoned their dogs, while an old friend of his known as Bad Grief requests assistance with a local man who has been injured. The leader of the town's economy and industry, a powerful man known as 'Fat Vlad', vouches for Artemy, and his innocence is restored. At his father's funeral, Artemy discovers that his father seemingly died of a strange stab wound. He is urged to accept his father's legacy as a menkhu, a special caste of Kin folk with the right to cut open bodies. In doing so, he is given a list containing the names of seven local children, plus a strange steppe sigil that he is told means 'udurgh'. He learns that these are the children his father felt would be most important in 'rebuilding the town', and that they must be kept safe at all costs. Signs of an outbreak begin to appear in the village, including a strange rot on the sides of buildings and an ominous black cloud within his father's old bedroom. A plague known as 'Sand Pest' or 'Sand Plague' strikes the town, killing people within a day of infection and leaving the districts abandoned and rife with looters the next. Artemy is required to perform daily tasks at the hospital in exchange for food and money, as food prices rise rapidly once the outbreak hits. It is revealed that the Sand Pest has hit the town once before, and Isidor managed to curb the outbreak by boarding up the infected district and leaving all those within to die. He encounters a young Herb Bride- a caste of Kin women who dance barefoot to encourage the growth of sacred herbs such as twyre- who seems to know him, and eventually tells him he is destined to kill her. Artemy is able to use his father's old equipment to create tinctures that increase immunity, and later can mix these with organs or blood to produce antibiotics and painkillers. He collects sacred blood from a crack in the ground in an ancient steppe village, and finds that combining this with tinctures produces a panacea that cures Sand Pest- however, there is only enough blood for two doses. An Inquisitor, Aglaya Lilich, arrives in the city. She has been sent to save the town at any cost, and Artemy is warned by others that Inquisitors are inherently manipulative and dangerous. He continues to try and discover how to gain access to larger amounts of sacred blood, eventually learning that the only way to get enough to stop the plague is to destroy a tower known as the 'Polyhedron' which houses hundreds of children. The mysterious 'udurgh' refers to the Earth itself, which is leaking out the sacred blood due to being repeatedly harmed and nearly killed by the Town's presence. Destroying the Polyhedron will produce enough of this blood to cure everyone, but kill the Earth in the process, causing many of the 'miracles' of the world- including many aspects of the Kin- to fade and die. It is up to the player which option they choose- either the tower is destroyed and the town is saved (the 'Diurnal' ending), or the tower remains in place and the Kin retake the Town as their own (the 'Nocturnal' ending). == Gameplay == All the action takes place in the Town-on-Gorkhon, a town with no further name located in an unspecified area of the steppe. The town culture represents a mix of Russian culture not long before the 1917 Revolution, and the ancient traditions of the steppe inhabitants which is full of strange customs and superstitions. The town itself is divided into a number of sections named after body parts, such as 'The Flank' and 'The Gut', which may become infected or abandoned throughout the game. The player's actions often directly affect which districts become infected and which remain healthy, and travelling through infected districts greatly raises the player's own infection risk. The player must manage a variety of needs in order to stay alive, including Hunger, Thirst, Exhaustion, Health, Immunity and Reputation. Hunger can be sated with food which can be bought at shops, received from trade with villagers or stolen from NPC houses. Thirst can be sated with water, which becomes rare and often infected during later gameplay. Exhaustion can be managed with sleep- during which the player often dreams, which reinforce themes or directly progress the story- or with coffee beans, though these damage health. Health itself is affected by these three factors, and also decreases when the player is attacked, infected or if they take fall damage. Immunity must be maintained using tinctures or immunity boosters in order to avoid infection, and once infected antibiotics must be consistently taken until a cure can be found. Reputation is boosted by trading with others, completing hospital duties and treating infected patients, while reputation is harmed by killing innocent people, harvesting organs and looting houses. If the player's reputation becomes too low, shops will refuse to sell to them, townspeople will refuse to trade with them and they can be attacked on sight by other characters. Pathologic takes place over twelve in-game days, which grow shorter as the game progresses. The player must save manually at clocks located throughout the town. If the player dies, they find themselves in the theatre, where Mark Immortell will explain to them that dying has certain consequences. These consequences stack the more times the player dies, and include punishments such as lower maximum health, faster increases to hunger and exhaustion, and more minor punishments such as the inability to hug other characters. These penalties cannot be undone by loading a previous save, and can only be removed by starting a new game or editing the source files. == Development == In September 2014, Ice-Pick Lodge team launched a fundraising campaign on Kickstarter: according to the Kickstarter description, a remake was supposed to keep the overall plot of the game and the world of the original game, but with updated graphics and game mechanics as well as better AI and behavior model of the disease.Pathologic (Мор.Утопия) by Ice-Pick Lodge — Kickstarter According to the promises of developers, the duration of the game should exceed 70 hours. On October 7, 2014, the campaign ended with a total donation of $333,127. This money was enough to fulfill the first super goal—the expansion of the in-game town. Initially, the release of the game was scheduled for autumn 2016. The developers claim that there are enough changes and innovations in the game to call it a separate game and not a remake. On December 1, 2016, those who donated a sufficient amount of money to the Kickstarter or the game site were granted a demo version of the game called \\"Pathologic: The Marble Nest\\", which is essentially a separate game. Later the development was extended until autumn of 2017. On March 14, 2017 \\"The Marble Nest\\" became available to everyone. In August 2017, the development was extended until 2018, changing the Russian name from \\"Mor (Utopia)\\" to just \\"Mor\\", and the English one from \\"Pathologic\\" to \\"Pathologic 2\\". At the same time, Pathologic 2 also remains a new game, and not a continuation of the original. In August 2018, an alpha version of the game was released. On March 28, 2019, it was officially announced that the first part of the game, telling the story of the Haruspex, will be released on May 23 of the same year.Pathologic 2 - Release Date Trailer  Children of Gorkhon The PS4 version released on March 6, 2020. On July 6, 2020, Ice-Pick Lodge announced that they were working on the second of three promised scenarios, \\"The Bachelor\\", stating it is to be released \\"in the foreseeable future.\\" == Reception == Pathologic 2 received \\"mixed or average reviews\\" according to review aggregator Metacritic, with a score of 69 based on 27 reviews. Users, however, gave it an average rating of 8.6, representing \\"generally favourable reviews\\" based on 165 player reviews. Critics praised the game's unique atmosphere, but criticized its unforgiving survival mechanics and clunky combat. In response to this, the game's developers added difficulty sliders to the game, allowing customisation of specific parameters in addition to overall difficulty. == References == == External links == * Category:2019 video games Category:Role- playing video games Category:Psychological horror games Category:Steampunk video games Category:Crowdfunded video games Category:Survival video games Category:Art games Category:Kickstarter-funded video games Category:Single- player video games Category:Video game remakes Category:Video games developed in Russia Category:Windows games Category:PlayStation 4 games Category:Xbox One games Category:Unity (game engine) games Category:Adventure games ","title":"Pathologic 2"},{"id":"60356030","text":"Stoyko Malov (born 6 June 1943) is a Bulgarian wrestler.

The case revolved around the Metropolitan Police arresting the claimants prior to the wedding of Prince William and Catherine Middleton based on intelligence that the group intended to disrupt the wedding. The claimants argued that they had been arrested on no valid preventive basis. The Court dismissed the claim as inadmissible due to ill- founded beliefs. == Background == Prince William, second in line to the British throne, married Catherine Middleton in London on 29 April 2011. The defendants being republicans objected to the wedding and planned ways in which to disrupt it. The defendants were involved in three plans. One was attempting to go to a republican street party at Red Lion Square hosted by the Republic political pressure group but was arrested by a plainclothes Metropolitan Police officer. Eiseman-Renyard and one other were dressed as zombies as part of a \\"Queer Resistance\\" plan to hold a \\"zombie picnic\\"; the police arrested them based on a leaflet that suggested that \\"maggot confetti\\" would be thrown. The remainder were arrested by the British Transport Police at Charing Cross railway station after being found in possession of republican placards and megaphones having intended to join a Republic tea party in Trafalgar Square. The police arrested them on the grounds that they could have caused a breach of the peace due to the large number of monarchists on the streets supporting the royal wedding. The claimants were all later released without charge after the wedding had finished. The claimants then requested a judicial review of their arrests. The High Court of Justice dismissed the claims on the grounds that the arrests had been proportionate to prevent any immediate breach of the peace. They appealed to the Court of Appeal on a point of law that they believed the arrests were unlawful and contrary to Article 5 of the European Convention on Human Rights. The court denied this on the grounds that the High Court's judgment had not been challenged. Permission was granted to appeal to the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom, who ruled that the police had the right to detain someone to stop them from imminently committing an offence. Leave was then granted to the claimants to appeal to the European Court of Human Rights. == Case == The case was heard on the grounds of an alleged deprivation of liberty under Article 5. The court found that certain types of preemptive detention were considered legal in order to allow police forces to be effective. The claimants had claimed the police had adopted an illegal policy for arrests during the royal wedding; however, the European Court stated that there was no evidence of this and that the police had sufficient grounds for arrest due to suspicion of imminent illegal activities and that a fair balance had been made between the claimants' right to liberty and the safety of the public. Accordingly, all of the claimants' cases were dismissed as inadmissible based on the fact they were \\"manifestly ill-founded\\".

J. Graham, (Vol XXVI) 1–9 March 1915 (series) ==Alternative spelling== While Tecuya is the most common spelling, variations in spelling have been used including Tucoya (Graham) and Tecoya (MillerHistory of Kern County, California by Thelma B. Miller, published by S. J. Clarke Publishing Company, Chicago (1929)). ==Key reference== An Indian chief named Tecuya was a central figure in a series of newspaper articles published by W. J. Graham in 1915. The series was entitled \\"The Lost Padre Mine or The Mystery of Tejon\\" edited by Frederick Q. Tredway, the newspaper's \\"city editor\\". Tredway also played a role in shaping these stories through editorial comment. According to Graham, the story he committed to paper was from the Native American story-telling tradition (oral history). A version of this same tale was published 13 years earlier in the San Francisco Chronicle in 1902. The source of the story was attributed to Graham by the author Flora Haines Loughead.San Francisco Chronicle: Lost Padre Mine by Flora Haines Loughead, 2 February 1902, page 11 ==Biography== William John Graham was born 13 November 1859 at Carson Hill, County of Calaveras, California, from parents that had immigrated from Ireland. William was a blacksmith by trade who worked in Bakersfield, CA, for a number of years. In 1888 Graham was elected Sheriff of Kern County running on a Democratic ticket. He served one, two-year term as sheriff from April 1889 to April 1891.Memorial and Biographical History of the Counties of Fresno, Tulare and Kern, California by Myron Angel - The Lewis Publishing Company, Chicago (1892) page 412 He was twice married, firstly to Agnes Sullivan on 11 April 1878. His second marriage was c.1904 to Julia Elizabeth Hinkson (1874-1964).https://www.familysearch.org/tree/pedigree/landscape/K8HG- RF8United States of America, Bureau of the Census, Washington, D.C., National Archives and Records Administration, 1 June 1900http://www.frontierfolk.net/ramsha_research/Hinkson/RR01/RR01_063.HTML Around the turn of the century, Graham turned his attention to gold mining in Tuolumne County. \\"W. J. Graham, superintendent of the Duleek mine near Sonora, is arranging to add new machinery to the plant and will run a tunnel 4000 feet in length to tap the ledge at a depth of 800 feet.\\"Mining and Scientific Press, Volumes 84, Number 14, San Francisco, 5 April 1902, page 195 The Duleek gold mine was in Groveland, Big Oak Flat District, East Belt area, in Tuolumne County. Graham died at age 74 on 3 January 1934, Eugene, Lane, Oregon.http://stchsgenealogy.com/p52.htm#i1556 ==Legend== Graham told the story of an exposed gold ledge where pure gold could be simply picked up from the ground. He claimed his story came from the Native American oral-history or story-telling tradition before the recording of written history in that part of California. Tecuya's father told him of Jesuit priests who had come to their village in San Emigdio Canyon from across the Colorado River. Several priests lived among the Indians and built smelters for processing ore. Every year they loaded a mule train with processed gold and silver recovered in the area which they exported across the Colorado River. One of these annual expeditions was attacked by Paiute Indians and two priests were killed. In an ensuing inter-tribal battle that started at the Canebrake (Battle of the Canebrake), three remaining priests also lost their lives. Their deaths put an end to the export of precious metals by these mission fathers. Some years later another priest arrived at Tecuya's village. This time it was a priest from the Dominican or Franciscan Order. He came alone with a smaller mule train of 13 animals. Every year for eleven consecutive years, this priest exported gold that he had recovered single-handedly from a secret location in the surrounding mountains. On his last trip, the priest revealed the gold ledge to the young Tecuya making him the life-long guardian of the gold field. Tecuya was sworn to keep the location an absolute secret. A padre's curse was placed on the site with serious consequences, including death, for any interlopers. Native Americans in particular took these curses very seriously. ==Other authors== A number of authors have repeated the stories introduced by Graham in partnership with the newspaper man, Tredway. Examples of authors who published versions of Graham's stories include Virginia Wegis, Thelma B. Miller, Harry Earl Rieseberg, Clarence Cullimore, Jerry Reynolds, and Annie Rose Briggs. Using a different spelling for Tecuya's name, the author, Thelma B. Miller, wrote about Tecoya and his father, also named Tecoya, in her book \\"History of Kern County, California\\" published in 1929. Thelma Miller's account closely parallels the William J. Graham story and therefore her account appears to be entirely derivative rather than being based on independent corroborative sources. Virginia Wegis published a series of stories for their intrigue and entertainment valueLegend of the Lost Padres Mine by Virginia Wegis, Gold Prospectors News, vol. 5, no. 5, November 1979 published by the Gold Prospectors Association of America Her stories paraphrased what Graham had published in 1915. The architect, Clarence Cullimore, also refers to Tucoya in his booklet, \\"Old Adobes of Forgotten Fort Tejon\\" but acknowledges William J. Graham as the source.Old Adobes of Forgotten Fort Tejon by Clarence Cullimore (1941) pages 36, 43 and 44 ==Geographical nomenclature== A mountain, a ridge, a canyon, and a creek are all named after Tecuya. Tecuya Mountain (7,163 feet) is the highest point on the Tecuya Ridge section of the San Emigdio Mountain range bordering Cuddy Valley in southern Kern County. Tecuya Mountain is the headwaters of Tecuya Creek that flows north through Tecuya Canyon. The name Tecuya first appeared on U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) maps in 1904.http://www.hundredpeaks.org/signatures/04e.htm Rather than being named after a person, these geographical features were named after a Native American tribe which was a sub grouping known as the Tecuya Chumash. ==Origin of name== The origin of the geographical name Tecuya is thought to be derived from the Indian word, Tokya, which is the name the Yokut Indians used when referring to the neighboring Chumash peoples.California Place Names of Indian Origin, Volume 12, by Alfred Louis Kroeber (1916) The origin of that name is probably the Yokut word thoxil meaning \\"west\\". In other words, a descriptive name for their western neighbors, or tribe to the west.California Place Names: The Origin and Etymology of Current Geographical Names, by Erwin G. Gudde, University of California Press (2010), page 387California Indian Languages by Victor Golla, University of California Press (2011), page236 In an expedition in 1806, the diarist Father José María Zalvidea visited the Indian ranchería (village) named Taku'y/Tacui.Historical Overview of Los Padres National Forest by E. R. Blakley and Karen Barnette, July 1985, page 15 The report mentioned 23 inhabitants who were living in this village near what later became known as Tecuya Creek. Father Zalvidea baptized two old men there that he named Fernando and Ramon.Colonial Expeditions To The Interior Of California Central Valley, 1800-1820 - by S. F. Cook, University of California Press (1958), page 246 Taku'y/Tacui could be a Spanish transliteration of the word, Tokya, so this is another possibility for the origin of the name Tecuya. The inland Chumash welcomed many coastal Chumash refugees fleeing Mexican-era oppression including a large migration of Kagismuwas Chumash who vacated the area of the current-day Vandenberg Air Force Base to take up residency in Tecuya Canyon.https://www.aaanativearts.com/native-american-tribes-by- region/california-tribes-by-region/chumash-indians ==Death== At the end of the nineteenth century, Tecuya was said to be one of the last of the full-blood, tribal elders remaining on what used to be the Sebastian Indian Reservation better known as the Tejon Indian Reservation (1853-1864). He lived in an isolated hut about eight miles from the ranch headquarters. Tecuya reportedly died on Tejon Ranch in 1898. He was thought to be around 100-years old at the time of his passing. ==Tashlipun== The name of the Chumash village in the mouth of San Emigdio Canyon was Tashlipun. The Graham/Tredway legend asserts that the chief of Tashlipun in the early 1800s was Tecuya. However, records clearly show the chief at that time was named Uichojo.North American Indigenous Warfare and Ritual Violence edited by Richard J. Chacon and Ruben G. Mendoza (2007)Forging Communities in Colonial Alta California edited by Kathleen L. Hull and John G. Douglas (2018) ==Validity== An elderly Indian named Tecuya was never mentioned in any of the studies made about Tejon Indian history covering the late nineteenth century. This includes John P. Harrington ethnographic and linguistic fieldwork at Tejon. Nor is anything found in the original notebooks of C. Hart Merriam, Alfred Kroeber, and Frank Forrest Latta from their research at Tejon. Both Harrington and Latta interviewed Bill Skinner, who Graham alleges was a close blood relative of Tecuya, yet Skinner never mentions any person with this name.Correspondence with John R. Johnson, Ph.D., Curator of Anthropology, Santa Barbara Museum of Natural History The absence of independent references to an Indian named Tecuya undermines the validity of William J. Graham's stories. Tecuya therefore appears to be a fictional character created to drive a story about a fabulously rich gold field in southern California's early history. It is reasonable to conclude Tecuya is not a real person but rather is an imaginary protagonist in a lost- mine legend. It appears Tecuya only exists as a larger-than-life character in folklore. == References == Category:Year of birth missing Category:1898 deaths ","title":"Chief Tecuya"},{"id":"60356596","text":"Christian women in the patristic age appear in later works of art.

The 15 March 1793 the city is taken by the Vendée insurgents. == Prelude == The Convention having ordered, on February 23, the levying of 300,000 men, the first riots began in the Mauges at the announcement of the terms of recruitment. On the 2nd and 3rd of March, young men from the canton assembled at Cholet by the district manifested their refusal to leave. At Beaupréau, mobs threatened the national guard who shot and killed three rebels and wounded eight.. On 12 March, at Saint-Florent-le-Vieil, 600 peasants put the republican forces to flight, on March 13th, the peasants who put Jacques Cathelineau at their head took Jallais. On the 14th of March, Chemillé fell in his turn, stormed by these same peasants. Most of the 200 National Guards defending the city were captured, as well as their three culverins, the largest of which was renamed the \\"Marie-Jeanne\\" by the peasants of Anjou who made it a true mascot. The victories of Cathelineau provoked the uprising of hundreds of other parishes which joined the small army of the insurgents, with notably Jean-Nicolas Stofflet. == The battle == On 15 March the peasants, numbering 15,000, presented themselves before Cholet. An emissary was sent to negotiate the surrender of the patriots, but Beauveau, the commandant of the place, refused. He estimated that his 580 national guards, well armed, were sufficient to repel peasants armed with scythes. But he was mistaken: in a few hours the insurgents seized the city, 150 patriots were killed, including Beauveau against 40 rebels. An important booty was seized. == Consequences == The next day the insurgents seized Vihiers, whom the patriots had preferred to abandon. The peasants, however, were afraid of the repression of the \\"Blues\\" whom they knew to be inevitable. It was at this moment that the insurgents went to fetch the nobles of their country, former soldiers, to force them to put themselves at their head. Thus several nobles like Charles Artus of Bonchamps or Maurice Gigost of Elbée joined the insurrection. At the initiative of their leaders, the insurgents then decided to march on Chalonnes-sur-Loire near Angers. The city was defended by 4,000 soldiers. Faced with the threat of the insurgents, the defenders preferred to abandon the city and retreated to Angers. At that moment the peasants who had driven the patriots out of their countries dispersed and returned home. The revolt had thus ended, but the revolutionary armies sent to repress it were to restart the war in the Mauges. On April 14, 1793, the Republican General Leygonier occupies the city of Cholet which will be resumed the next day by the Royalists. The Republican prisoners, including Jean-Julien Savary, were saved from death thanks to the prayer of the inhabitants. == References == == Bibliography == * * * .

The company was co-founded by director, designer and visual artist Michael Counts, performer and producer Michelle Stern and scholar and Butoh performer John Oglevee . In the first two years, GAle GAtes et al. productions were mounted in multiple indoor and outdoor locations in New York, Thailand and Japan ranging from the vacant floors of skyscrapers to the side of a mountain at Min Tanaka's Body Weather Farm. In 1997, the company became resident in a 40,000 sq ft warehouse space in Dumbo, Brooklyn where it produced five large scale performance installations and presented numerous visual art installations, gallery exhibitions and performances. The New York Times described GAle GAtes et al. as \\"an adventurous troupe with one foot in the world of post-modern art and the other in downtown performance\\". This feeling can be compared to wandering through a gallery and encountering surprising artworks, much like Counts wandered through the galleries of the Metropolitan Museum of Art as a child.

Dalziel was most notable for being considered the best technical surgeon at the time in the west of Scotland. He was also particularly notable for the discovery of a disease called chronic interstitial enteritis in 1913, that later became known as Crohn's disease. ==Life== Dalziel took his early schooling in Dumfries before matriculating at the University of Edinburgh Medical School and subsequently graduated in 1883 with a Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery. After visiting Berlin to gain experience in experimental surgery and Vienna for pathology, Dalziel returned to Glasgow to start his post clinical training with a post as a house surgeon at the Glasgow Royal Infirmary with the noted neurologist William Macewen ==Career== In 1885, Dalziel succeeded Sir William Macewen as casualty surgeon at the Glasgow Royal Infirmary, and held the position until 1894. In 1889 he was appointed to the surgical staff of the Western Infirmary as an assistant to Sir Hector Clare Cameron in ward rounds and teaching. In 1891 he was appointed Professor of Medical Jurisprudence at Anderson's College. In 1993 he appointed Dean at Andersons and in 1895 he promoted to Professor of Surgery. He remained in that post at Anderson until 1902 when he was promoted to Visiting Surgeon at the Western Infirmary. Dalziel was also associated with the Royal Hospital for Sick Children for many years, and where he took an active part in the planning and erection of the new hospital. He was appointed in 1888 as an extra honorary surgeon at the Dispensary. In 1892, when Hector Clare Cameron resigned his post, Dalziel was appointed as Visiting Surgeon to the Royal Hospital for Sick Children. In 1913, Dalziel gave the Dr James Watson lecture for the Faculty of Physicians and Surgeons, with a title of Some practical points in abdominal surgery. For much of his life, Dalziel volunteered, initially in his home county of Dumfriesshire but later in a military capacity working at the Royal Engineers in the Clyde submarine division. When the Territorial Medical Service was established in 1908, Dalziel joined immediately, he was posted to the 3rd General Hospital located at Stobhill Hospital in Glasgow as director with the rank of Major à la suite. When the first world war broke out, Dalziel and his unit wee mobilised to the Royal Army Medical Corps and was promoted to the rank of Lieutenant-colonel. In 1916 the War Office ordered him to visit various hospitals in France. ==Crohn's disease== In 1913 Crohn's disease was first discovered by Dalziel while he was a surgeon at the Western Infirmary, and that he described in his classic paper, Chronic Interstitial Enteritis. In his paper Dalziel described nine patients in which he observed eosinophils, giant cells and granulomas with no infectious agents. The first patient was a professional colleague and upon operating Dalziel found that the whole intestine was chronically inflamed and was unable to restore function with the patient dying. The second patient was seen several years later in Paisley and was more acute and this patient also died. The third patient was called Mrs T by Dalziel and was seen in 1905. Dalzeil operated along with Samson Gemmell and removed two feet of the jejunum that was found to be infected. In a child of 10 he found a great thickening of the bowel wall and in a description of the pathology described it as having the consistence and smoothness of an eel in a state of rigor mortis. Of the nine patients two died of the disease, the other seven were treated to surgery. Dalziel described common symptoms in all the cases, that were characteristic feature being violent colic that caused vomiting and occasionally an escape of some blood, also constant mucus from the bowel. In the examination of the disease, Dalziel drew particular attention to the bowel, something that Burrill Bernard Crohn, the American gastroenterologist who discovered the disease, did not. Dalziel gave it the name hyperplastic enteritis. ==Membership== Dalziel was a member of the Royal Medical Society and the Pathological and Clinical Society of Glasgow located at Faculty Hall, 242 St Vincent's Street, Glasgow. In 1887 Dalziel was elected as a Fellow of the Faculty of Physicians and Surgeons that was later known as the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Glasgow. ==Awards and honours== For his services during World War I to the Advisory Council of the Royal Army Medical Corps, Dalziel was knighted by King George V. ==References== Category:1861 births Category:1924 deaths Category:Scottish surgeons Category:British gastroenterologists Category:Alumni of the University of Edinburgh ","title":"Thomas Kennedy Dalziel"},{"id":"60356891","text":"Netherlands – New Zealand relations is the official relationship between the Kingdom of the Netherlands and New Zealand. New Zealand has an embassy in The Hague and the Netherlands has an embassy in Wellington. The Ambassador to the Netherlands is concurrently accredited to Denmark, Finland, Iceland and Norway. Both New Zealand and the Netherlands are constitutional monarchies. They share very similar social attitudes and values and have a substantial history of working together on issues of international importance. They often cooperate closely in multilateral forums. In many international meetings the Netherlands delegation is seated immediately alongside New Zealand. De Molen in Foxton, New Zealand There is also a strong academic and research cooperation between Wageningen University in the Netherlands and Massey University in New Zealand. Cultural connections between the two countries were enhanced in 2010, with “Te Hono ki Aotearoa”, a waka taua, being provided on permanent loan to the Dutch National Museum of Ethnology in Leiden. Moreover, 256 New Zealand airmen killed in World War II lie buried in the Netherlands, in 85 different cemeteries. In 2003, a full size replica of a Dutch windmill, called De Molen was completed and opened in Foxton, New Zealand.Nederlanders in Nieuw-Zeeland ==History== An early map of Australasia during the Golden Age of Dutch exploration and discovery (). Based on a chart by Joan Blaeu, Historically there has been a strong link between New Zealand and the Netherlands. In December 1642, Dutch explorer Abel Tasman became the first European to sight New Zealand. He arrived in his ships Heemskerck and Zeehaen and anchored at the northern end of the South Island in Golden Bay (he named it Murderers' Bay). Tasman named it Staten Land \\"in honour of the States General\\" (Dutch parliament). He wrote, \\"it is possible that this land joins to the Staten Land but it is uncertain\\", referring to a landmass of the same name at the southern tip of South America, discovered by Jacob Le Maire in 1616. He also named Cape Maria van Diemen and the Three Kings Islands. Mount Tasman, Abel Tasman National Park, the Tasman Glacier and the Tasman Region are named after him. In a hostile encounter, four crew members were killed and at least one Māori was hit by canister shot. Tasman sketched sections of the two main islands' west coasts and left and there was no further contact between the Netherlands and New Zealand for more than a hundred years. In 1645, Dutch cartographers renamed the land Nova Zeelandia after the Dutch province of Zeeland. British explorer James Cook subsequently anglicised the name to New Zealand. Once New Zealand was established as a state in 1840 relations have been good. The relationship was enhanced significantly with migration of large numbers of Dutch people to New Zealand after World War II. Before World War II there were only 128 Dutch-born people in New Zealand, including Gerrit van Asch (grandfather of Henry Piet Drury van Asch) who established the Van Asch College, and Petrus van der Velden. New Zealand's eighth premier Julius Vogel was son of a Dutchman.The invisible immigrants As a result of negotiations between the Dutch and New Zealand Governments a migration agreement was signed in October 1950. This resulted in thousands of Dutch immigrants coming to New Zealand in subsequent years. Peaking between 1951 and 1954, with 10,583 immigrants. By 1968, they formed the biggest group of non-British immigrant groups.Our relationship with the Netherland The 2013 census shows that 28,503 people identified their ethnic group as Dutch. The Netherlands Embassy in Wellington estimated that there were approximately 45,000 Dutch citizens residing in New Zealand. This number includes persons with dual New Zealand and Dutch nationality. Today more than 150,000 New Zealanders claim Dutch heritage. There is also a sizable expatriate New Zealand community in the Netherlands. New Zealand has maintained a resident ambassador in the Netherlands since 1967, and a resident Head of Mission since 1950. ==Trade== The Netherlands is an important export destination for New Zealand’s goods and a significant source of investment. For the year 2017, the Netherlands was its fourth-largest trading partner within the European Union. Fonterra and Mainfreight have both chosen to locate their European Headquarters in the Netherlands. In 2017, New Zealand exported $874 million (403 237 goodsInternationale handel; in- en uitvoer naar SITC (1 digit) en land 2008-2017 ) to the Netherlands and imported $571 million (510 282 goodsInternationale handel; in- en uitvoer naar SITC (1 digit) en land 2008-2017 ).Top export products are sheep meat, dairy products and unwrought aluminium.

It is a roman à clef loosely based upon the life of socialite and flapper Starr Faithfull, whose unsolved death in 1931 became a tabloid sensation. Reviews were mixed but the novel was a best-seller. It was adapted for a 1960 movie of the same name, starring Elizabeth Taylor and Laurence Harvey. A paperback edition published at the same time sold more than one million copies. In 2019 it was one of four John O'Hara novels published in a collection by the Library of America. ==Plot summary== The novel explores the life of Gloria Wandrous, a young woman having an affair with Weston Liggett, an older, married businessman. Set in New York circa 1931, it fills in her family background and sexual history, and it locates her within a circle of friends, their relationships, and economic struggles, providing a closely observed tour of \\"the sordid and sensational lives of people on the fringe of café society and the underworld\\". The minor character of Jimmy Malloy, a junior newspaper reporter, serves as O'Hara’s alter ego; he has the style of a Yale University graduate but not the means. The title of the novel derives from the pattern of telephone exchange names in the United States and Canada. Until the early 1970s, telephone exchanges were indicated by two letters and commonly referred to by names instead of by numbers, with the BU represented on the telephone dial as \\"28,\\" followed by four digits. In December 1930 an additional digit was appended to the exchange name. BUtterfield was an exchange that provided service to Manhattan's well- to-do Upper East Side, and BUtterfield 8 was still new when the novel was published. ==Reception== Clifton Fadiman's review in The New Yorker was titled \\"Disappointment in O'Hara\\", and Heywood Broun said O'Hara's characters all spoke with the same voice. Ernest Hemingway supplied the publisher with a blurb: \\"John O'Hara writes better all the time.\\" The New York Times said it provided \\"the ultra-ultra in fictional depiction of the willful degradation of sex\\". ==Adaptations== The novel was adapted for a film of the same name that was released in 1960. It starred Elizabeth Taylor, who won the Academy Award for Best Actress for her portrayal of Gloria Wandrous. O'Hara did not participate in writing the adaptation, and publicity for the film did not mention his name. With the release of the movie, more than 1 million paperback copies of the novel were sold. In a review of the movie, the Harvard Crimson described BUtterfield 8 \\"one of O'Hara's few good novels\\" and \\"one of the truly great chronicles of the 1930s\\". In 1960, at the time of the movie and paperback edition, O'Hara described his ambition in writing this novel: \\"I was determined to make plain what I had seen.\\" He claimed to have suppressed the more shocking details of the story and enjoyed that it was nevertheless \\"a shocker to the literary cocktail party set\\". He wrote: O'Hara donated the typescript of the novel to Yale, and complained when an article in the Yale Alumni Magazine about the school’s holdings in American literature omitted mention of him. ==Second edition== When Random House republished the novel in 1995, Margo Jefferson criticized its prose but wrote that O'Hara was > \\"full of passion and honest spleen, driven to show why we live and act the > way we do. And how he understands class structure, American-style! The > comedy of it and the meanness, the social climbing and the downward plunges, > the tricky business of balancing your ethnic debits against your physical or > financial assets.\\" In 2013, writing in The New Yorker, Lorin Stein called BUtterfield 8 \\"one of the great novels of New York in the Depression\\". He noted that the novel remains fresh in presenting a wide range of sexual behaviors from the point of view of a woman and also allowing her an intense friendship–love on his part–with a male peer, commercial illustrator Eddie Brunner. ==Legacy and honors== BUtterfield 8 was one of four O'Hara novels included in a collection published by the Library of America in 2019. ==References== ;Additional sources * * Category:1935 American novels Category:Novels by John O'Hara Category:Suicide in fiction Category:American novels adapted into films Category:Novels set in New York City ","title":"BUtterfield 8 (novel)"},{"id":"60356973","text":"Zhangzheng () is a town under the administration of Xingqing District, Yinchuan, Ningxia, China. , it has one residential community and 11 villages under its administration. == References == Category:Township-level divisions of Ningxia Category:Yinchuan ","title":"Zhangzheng"},{"id":"60357005","text":"Tonggui Township () is a township under the administration of Xingqing District, Yinchuan, Ningxia, China. , it has 6 villages under its administration. == References == Category:Township-level divisions of Ningxia Category:Yinchuan ","title":"Tonggui Township"},{"id":"60357018","text":"The Arizona Project is the first large-scale implementation of collaborative journalism, triggered predominately by the murder of Arizona Republic reporter Don Bolles and with the support of the newly established nonprofit organisation Investigative Reporters and Editors, Inc (IRE). In June 1976, Bolles passed away in hospital following injuries amassed from a targeted car bombing in Phoenix. Bolles's rich investigative history relating to organised crime in Arizona and the rarity of such a murder indicated to working journalists that this attack was a direct response to his investigations. In the wake of Bolles's death, the Investigative Reporters and Editors organisation conceived The Arizona Project as a way to both continue and honour Bolles's investigative work within Arizona on a larger scale. With then-Newsday editor, Robert W. Greene overseeing the project, over 40 reporters flooded to Arizona - operating independently from the 23 different news organisations they came from - in an attempt to form together and uncover corruptive relationships between politics, business and organised crime within the state. Their research aimed to expose and portray these deep-rooted links in a series of news articles to then be published nationwide, while also functioning as a message meant to reflect the unity of journalists and the consequences of killing a reporter. The findings were distributed in numerous publications, however, due to various controversies surrounding the project, some newspapers such as The New York Times and The Washington Post avoided the series. Robert Greene described the findings to a CBS reporter, stating they reveal, \\"that Arizona is facing a massive problem in organised crime,\\" and the 23 part series indeed exposed names and stories regarding corruption, land fraud and organised crime in the state.\\" == Background == ===Don Bolles=== Donald Fifield Bolles was raised in Teaneck, New Jersey and graduated Teaneck High School in 1946, after which he completed a degree in government at Beloit College. Following a term in the United States Army in the Korean War, Bolles found a job at the Associated Press and by 1962 was hired by The Arizona Republic newspaper. By age forty seven, Bolles had carved out a career unearthing corruptive practices within the political sphere as well as exposing organised crime in Arizona. In the fourteen years he worked at the Arizona Republic, \\"he had uncovered secret political slush funds controlled by the state patrol, bribery of state tax commissioners, land fraud, and Mafia influence in a national sports concession firm, Emprise Corporation.\\" Bolles's investigative work was the catalyst for the Arizona State Legislature commanding Emprise Corporation to divest investments in a number of dog and horse racetracks in 1976. Together with another reporter, Bolles released the names of almost 200 organised crime individuals and their respective ties to legitimate companies in Arizona. Investigative work like this earned Bolles a nomination for a Pulitzer prize as well as an established reputation in the journalistic sphere throughout America, including an honorary award in his name at his former college. 353x353px Bolles had stopped doing investigative work for various reasons around ten months before he received a phone call on May 27 from a man claiming to have evidence of land fraud schemes implicating the aforementioned Emprise Corporation and well known business and political figures. After speaking briefly, Bolles agreed to meet the man, John Adamson, at 11:25 am on June 2 in the lobby entrance of the Clarendon House hotel in Phoenix. Adamson didn't turn up however, and instead called Bolles to inform him that their meeting was cancelled. Bolles was known to be a cautious man in his investigative days, habitually placing a piece of scotch tape over the front hood of his car so he would know if someone had tampered with his engine. However this wouldn't help Bolles from the six sticks of dynamite that were detonated underneath the vehicle's chassis as he started to pull out of the Phoenix parking lot. As Bolles lay half out the driver's side of the car, bleeding profusely and lapsing in and out of consciousness, he managed to whisper, \\"They finally got me... Emprise - the Mafia - John Adamson - find him.\\" He died in hospital 11 days later on June 13. ===Investigative Reporters and Editors, Inc. (IRE)=== Coincidentally, the newly established IRE had scheduled their first national conference just days after the bombing, and as a result, the meeting was abuzz with different ideas and theories concerning the attack. News of Bolles' murder shocked reporters, \\"and particularly those of us in the field of investigative reporting,\\" said experienced investigative reporter Clark Mollenhoff. \\"For years we had proceeded about our business ignoring threats to our lives and our job, more or less assuming that the bosses of organised crime and politics would 'be too smart' to kill a reporter or editor and stir up the whole journalistic community.\\" The community of journalists were unsurprisingly rattled, projecting fears that subjects of other investigations around the country may be encouraged to act violently toward investigating reporters following the attack on Bolles. After days of discussion, it was decided the best course of action to defend what they considered an assault on press freedom - as well as to signal to the world that reporters could not be muzzled - was to form a team to continue Bolles's work. Robert Greene was to lead the team on behalf of the IRE, and stated that \\"the purpose of such an investigation would not have as its direct aim the solution of Bolles's assassination. The point would be to expose the political-land fraud-mob structure of Arizona... For all of us - particularly newspapers with high investigative profiles - this is eminently self-serving. We are buying life insurance for our own reporters.\\"Robert W. Greene, \\"Memorandum RE: Bolles Affair,\\" July 19, 1976, IRE files == The project == The project began in October 1976, and emboldened by widespread support was expected to be completed by March 1977. Money for the project was raised from various organisations, philanthropists, citizens and even newsroom staffers around the country, who would donate a portion of their salaries. The final budget was estimated at $150,000. By January 1977, following extensive research and with overflowing files collated on different individuals and businesses, the Arizona Project team started to write. After only a month, the series was finished – a collection of 23 different articles detailed with photographs and biographies of significant individuals, spanning a total of over 100,000 words that outlined an intricate and deep-rooted web of organised crime and corruption in the state. As per the ideology of collaborative journalism that the team embodied, no one received individual credit for any of the work. Rather, the IRE was credited as the author of each article published across America as numerous news organisations began to distribute the series in March 1977. ===Findings=== 243x243pxThe series was broken down by a number of key themes - including land-development fraud; gambling, prostitution and drug trade; connections between politicians and individuals associated with organised crime; as well as corruption in the legal system - and was led with a story introducing the project and outlining some of the key stories that were to follow. Barry Goldwater, the Senator in Arizona and a 1964 U.S presidential candidate was a key target throughout the investigation, and many of the articles focused on friends and associates he was involved with. The Goldwater's were quoted stating the IRE reports were, 'ridiculous and untrue', however, his connection to underworld figures was argued to be at the very least the same as 'condoning organised crime'. The second day of publication outlined the dominance and reach of Barry Goldwater, as well as his involvement and connection to a ranch uncovered to be exploiting illegal alien workers. After a meeting with head of local border patrol, Raymond Feld, IRE reporter, Michael Wendland had learned that Feld's border patrol team was heavily understaffed, and at every request for extra support on raids, the border patrol team would turn up to Arrowhead ranch and find nothing and nobody illegal. Feld later found out spies from the ranch were tipped off to their plans at every stage. However, there was more to the story; every time they would catch and deport illegal aliens from the state, Feld and his team would often find them right back in Arizona not long after. There was an established trade of procuring and smuggling illegal workers, and even with extensive evidence and requested assistance to his superiors, Feld noted that 'they totally ignored it'. Reporters working on the story began to theorise someone higher up was squashing any interest in Arrowhead such as Barry Goldwater, a man of power whose family was a partial owner, allowing a decade of illegal workers to live in subhuman conditions near the Arrowhead ranches. The stories continued to outline ties from members of the Goldwater family and other political figures to individuals associated with organised crime, including Barry's brother, Robert Goldwater. The sixth story revealed Robert's involvement with an associate of American mobster Peter Licavoli and their partnership in the Arizona restaurant chain Hobo Jo's. The IRE exposed the chain as a, 'pipeline for mafia cash', as well as the scandalous details of where the money was going. Over the course of a 21 month period, over $1.5 million was siphoned from the chain to pay for 'wild parties with former playboy bunnies', as well as a $350,000 home for a Mafia associate. Barry Goldwater stated that the reports were, 'totally false,' and Robert called them, 'poppycock'. Articles published on days nine and ten examined Governor of Arizona, Raul Castro and his business linkage to Kemper Marley, a millionaire alcohol distributor implicated in the assassination of Don Bolle's by John Adamson, who had been arrested shortly after Bolles died. Days eleven, twelve and thirteen were centred around Ned Warren Sr. and his various business practices. It was said that he, among others, took advantage of loose regulations and loop holes surrounding land and real estate business, earning himself the nickname the, 'Godfather of land fraud'. Until 1975, he got away virtually untouched, jumping ship from one corporation to the next, while associates often took the brunt of the prosecution. Meeting with IRE reporters during the Arizona Project investigations he stated, 'I was a thief... a good thief'. The following week of stories set the stage for a first person account from IRE reporters, detailing their cross border travels with drug traffickers and tying together the extent of drug smuggling operations between Arizona and Mexico. The opening line of the 19th story claimed Arizona was, 'rapidly emerging as the most concentrated corridor of narcotics smuggling from Mexico into the United States'. Some of the key findings from the story revealed there to be 23 different major smuggling rings controlled by various crime families throughout America, as well as an estimation that as many as 800 licensed pilots earn a full-time income transporting narcotics from Mexico into Arizona. The final few stories dealt with organised crime and its corruptive influence on the criminal justice system, highlighting the leniency awarded to high profile families and prominent individuals. == Reception == Although the series was published in a number of newspapers across America, many significant publications, including Arizona’s own, ‘Arizona Republic,’ either completely rejected the series, or ran greatly edited versions. Reception was mixed; many agreed that the investigation brought to light a better understanding of the deep-seated roots of criminal practice throughout Arizona, engendering awareness and propelling action against such corruptive behaviours on a nationwide scale. However others argued that the collaborative journalism technique together with the Bolle’s influenced motivation of the Arizona Project encouraged sensationalist reporting and unnecessarily hostile and bias investigation. Other criticism catalysed a debate as to whether the collaborative technique undercut competition in the press, and whether local journalists were better situated to report on their own regions. Prominent Los Angeles Times news critic David Shaw stated of the project that the stories, were 'vague, unproven, filled with innuendo,’ and, ‘instead of proof, the Arizona team too frequently offered unsubstantiated surmise, syllogistic reasoning and hyperfervid language’Richard Cady letter to David Shaw, April 14, 1977, IRE files A month after initial publication of the series, a polling service in Phoenix called Behavior Research Center surveyed 1000 households spanning the Rocky Mountains. The results painted a picture of the profound impact the Arizona Project had on residents throughout the area and the report concluded that, ‘Without question, the IRE reports have had a negative impact on the image of Arizona among residents of the Rocky Mountain region.'Behavior Research Center, “IRE Reports Had Strong Impact in Arizona Western States”, undated press release, IRE files ==References== Category:American journalism ","title":"The Arizona Project"},{"id":"60357039","text":"Josef Hartwig (1880–1956) was a Bauhaus sculptor and Nazi party member best known for his 1923 design for a chess set. Josef Hartwig was born in on March 19, 1880 in Munich. Beginning at age 13, he served as an apprentice in the studio of stonemason Simon Korn. During his time in Korn's studio, Hartwig met a number of prominent architects including Theodor Fischer and August Endell. From 1904 to 1908 Hartwig attended the Academy of Fine Arts, Munich, studying under Balthasar Schmidt. For a brief period after his graduation, he worked as a stonemason, producing gravestones in Berlin. In 1921, Walter Gropius invited Hartwig to teach at the Bauhaus in Weimar. Hartwig accepted the offer going on to serve as a teacher and head of the sculpture department from 1921 to 1925. After his tenure at the Bauhaus, Hartwig continued producing sculptural work and began a brief career in art restoration. During the Third Reich, Hartwig was a member of the Nazi Party. ==Chess Sets== From 1922-24, Hartwig designed a series of wooden chess sets, which have now become a famous example of the Bauhaus design sensibilities. The detailed design of the pieces differed from model to model, but all of them feature geometric shapes with a square base--- in Model XVI from 1924 the pawns are plain wood cubes. The design of each piece combines two different forms of representation. First, they abstract the visual appearances of traditional chess pieces into simple geometric shapes. Second, the shape of each piece reflects how it moves: pawns and rooks move in straight lines and are represented as rectangular prisms, the bishops feature diagonal lines, the king has both straight and diagonal elements, and the knights are L-shaped. The chess sets were sold in two versions, a \\"daily use\\" version ( _Gebrauchsspiel_ ) which cost 51 Marks, and a hand-made \\"luxury\\" version ( _Luxusspiel_ ) which used more expensive types of wood and cost 155 Marks. As was the case with most Bauhaus products, this was too expensive for most consumers, and the chess sets remained a luxury item sold in small numbers. == References == Category:1880 births Category:1956 deaths Category:Nazi Party members Category:Bauhaus teachers Category:Artists from Munich ","title":"Josef Hartwig"},{"id":"60357046","text":"Baleshwar Ram was an Indian politician.

First published in 1951 by the former International Commission on the Rules for the Approval of Electrical Equipment (IECEE), it unified standards produced by several continental European countries. The 2nd edition was published in 1963 and last updated in March 1983. It remains available from the IEC, but they state that \\"this standard shall not be used alone, it is to be used in addition to IEC 60884-1\\". ==CEE 7 standards== The International Commission on the Rules for the Approval of Electrical Equipment (IECEE) was a standards body which published Specification for plugs and socket-outlets for domestic and similar purposes as CEE Publication 7, known simply as CEE 7\\\\. It was originally published in 1951, the 2nd edition was published in May 1963 and was last updated by Modification 4 in March 1983. CEE 7 consists of general specifications, plus a number of standard sheets for specific connectors. A number of standards based on two round pins with centres spaced at 19 mm are in use in continental Europe and elsewhere, most of which are listed in IEC/TR 60083 \\"Plugs and socket-outlets for domestic and similar general use standardized in member countries of IEC\\". There is no European Union regulation of domestic mains plugs and sockets, and the Low Voltage Directive specifically excludes domestic plugs and sockets. EU countries each have their own regulations and national standards; for example, some require child- resistant shutters, while others do not. CE marking is neither applicable nor permitted on plugs and sockets. ===CEE 7/1 unearthed socket and CEE 7/2 unearthed plug=== CEE 7/1 unearthed sockets are designed to accept CEE 7/2 round plugs without notches in the body and having pins. Because they have no earth connections they have been or are being phased out in most countries. The regulations of countries using the CEE 7/3 and CEE 7/5 socket standards vary in whether CEE 7/1 sockets are still permitted in environments where the need for earthing is less critical. Sweden, for example, prohibited them from new installations in 1994. In Germany unearthed sockets are rare, whereas in the Netherlands and Sweden it is still common to find them in \\"dry areas\\" such as in bedrooms or living rooms. Some countries prohibit use of unearthed and earthed sockets in the same room, in the \\"insulated room\\" concept, so that people cannot touch an earthed object and one that has become live, at the same time. The depth of the sockets varies between countries and age. Older sockets are so shallow that it is possible to touch the pins of a plug when the plug is inserted only deep enough to get electrical power on the pins, while newer sockets are deep enough to protect from this kind of accident. CEE 7/1 sockets accept CEE 7/4, CEE 7/6 and CEE 7/7 plugs without providing an earth connection. The earthed CEE 7/3 and CEE 7/5 sockets were specifically designed not to allow insertion of CEE 7/2 unearthed round plugs fitted to older appliances which had to be earthed via other means. Two Schuko (CEE 7-3) socket-outlets manufactured by Busch-Jaeger Elektro GmbH, the lower has (black) protective shutters, the upper does not, revealing internal metal contacts. ===CEE 7/3 socket and CEE 7/4 plug (German \\"Schuko\\"; Type F)=== Schuko plug (CEE 7/4) and socket (CEE 7/3) The CEE 7/3 socket and CEE 7/4 plug are commonly called Schuko. The socket (which is often, in error, also referred to as CEE 7/4) has a predominantly circular recess which is deep with two symmetrical round apertures and two earthing clips on the sides of the socket positioned to ensure that the earth is always engaged before live pin contact is made. The plug pins are . The Schuko connection system is symmetrical and unpolarised in its design, allowing line and neutral to be reversed. The socket also accepts Europlugs and CEE 7/17 plugs. It is rated at 16 A. The current German standards are DIN 49441:1972-06 \\"Two-pole plugs with earthing-contact 10 A 250 V≅ and 10 A 250 V–, 16 A 250 V∼\\" (which also includes CEE 7/7 plug) and DIN 49440-1:2006-01 \\"Two-pole socket-outlets with earthing contact, 16 A 250 V a.c.\\" In addition to Germany, it is used in Albania, Austria, Belarus, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Chile, Croatia, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Georgia, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Indonesia, Iran, Italy (standard CEI 23-50), Kazakhstan, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Republic of Macedonia, Republic of Moldova, the Netherlands, Norway, Pakistan, Peru, Portugal, Romania, Russia, Serbia, Slovenia, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Turkey, Ukraine, and Uruguay. It was widely used in Ireland until 1964, a legacy of Ireland's early electricity grid which was largely built based on design work on the Shannon hydroelectric scheme by Siemens-Schuckert. The British BS1363 (localised as Irish Standard I.S.401) was adopted as the new standard plug to ease import of electrical appliances from the UK. CEE 7/1 and CEE 7/4 are still occasionally found in less used areas of some older homes, particularly in outbuildings or hot presses. Schuko is an abbreviation for the German word Schutzkontakt, which means \\"Protective contact\\" - in this case \\"protective\\" refers to the earth. Some countries, including South Korea, Portugal, Finland, Denmark, Norway and Sweden, require child-proof socket shutters; the German DIN 49440-1:2006-01 standard does not have this requirement. ===CEE 7/5 socket and CEE 7/6 plug (French; Type E)=== French socket Rewireable French plug The CEE 7/5 socket and CEE 7/6 plug are defined in French standard NF C 61-314 \\"Plugs and socket-outlets for household and similar purposes\\" (which also includes CEE 7/7, 7/16 and 7/17 plugs) The socket has a predominantly circular recess which is deep with two symmetrical round apertures and a round earth pin projecting from the socket such that the tip is beyond the live contacts, to ensure that the earth is always engaged before live pin contact is made. The earth pin is centred between the apertures, offset by . The plug (which is often, in error, also referred to as CEE 7/5) has two round pins measuring , spaced apart and with an aperture for the socket's projecting earth pin. This standard is also used in Belgium, Denmark, Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and some other countries. Although the plug is polarised, CEE 7 does not define the placement of the line and neutral and there is no universally-observed standard. However, the Czech standard recommends that the line wire be on the left side when facing the socket. The French convention changed circa 2002 from nothing particular, to, if the earth pin was at the top then the line hole in the socket would be on the right looking at the socket. However, the socket may not necessarily be installed with the earth pin at the top. Packaging in France of sockets is normally marked with correct connection of the cables. Polarised pre-fitted plugs on appliances are therefore connected with the brown line wire to the right pin and the blue neutral wire to the left, the earth being connected to the contact at the \\"top\\" of the plug. CEE 7/2 and 7/4 plugs are not compatible with the CEE 7/5 socket because of the round earthing pin permanently mounted in the socket. === CEE 7/7 plug (compatible with E and F) === CEE 7/7 plug To bridge the differences between German and French standards, the CEE 7/7 plug was developed. It is polarised to prevent the line and neutral connections from being reversed when used with a French CEE 7/5 socket, but allows polarity reversal when inserted into a German CEE 7/3 socket. The plug is rated at 16 A. It has earthing clips on both sides to connect with the CEE 7/3 socket and a female contact to accept the earthing pin of the CEE 7/5 socket. Currently, appliances in many countries are sold with non-rewireable CEE 7/7 plugs attached, enabling use in all countries whose socket standards are based on either CEE 7/3 or CEE 7/5. This plug can be inserted into a Danish Type K socket, but earthing is not enabled. === CEE 7/16 plugs === The CEE 7/16 standard sheet appears in Supplement 2 (June 1962) to the 1951 edition of CEE 7. The CEE 7/16 unearthed plug is used for low power Class II applications, it has two round 4 by 19 mm (0.157 by 0.748 in) pins, rated at 2.5 A. There are two variants. ====CEE 7/16 Alternative I==== Alternative I is a round plug with cutouts to make it compatible with CEE 7/3 and CEE 7/5 sockets. (The similar-appearing CEE 7/17 has larger pins and a higher current rating.) This alternative is seldom used. ====CEE 7/16 Alternative II \\"Europlug\\" (Type C)==== Example of a Europlug Alternative II, popularly known as the Europlug, is a flat plug defined by Cenelec standard EN 50075 and national equivalents. The Europlug is not rewirable and must be supplied with a flexible cord. It can be inserted in either direction, so line and neutral are connected arbitrarily. There is no socket defined by EN 50075; neither is there a socket specified in CEE 7 to accept only the Europlug. Instead, the Europlug was designed to be compatible with a range of sockets in common use in Europe. These sockets, including the CEE 7/1, CEE 7/3 (German/\\"Schuko\\"), CEE 7/5 (French), and most Israeli, Swiss, Danish and Italian sockets, were designed to accept pins of various diameters, mainly 4.8 mm but also 4.0 mm and 4.5 mm, and are usually fed by final circuits with either 10 A or 16 A overcurrent protection devices. To improve contact with socket parts the Europlug has slightly flexible pins which converge toward their free ends. UK shaver sockets designed to accept BS 4573 shaver plugs also accept Europlugs for applications requiring less than 200 mA.Typical example of BS 4573 compliant socket that accepts europlug (and Australian) http://www.tlc- direct.co.uk/Technical/DataSheets/MK/K700.pdf Other than such personal hygiene applications, UK consumer protection legislation does not permit Europlugs. The Europlug is also used in the Middle East, Africa, South America, and Asia . ===CEE 7/17 unearthed plug=== CEE 7/17 plug This is a round plug which conforms to a shape compatible with CEE 7/1, CEE 7/3, and CEE 7/5 sockets.

She worked on circular dichroism and bioseparation. In 1967 Phillips was the first African- American woman to complete a bachelor's degree at Vanderbilt University. == Early life and education == Phillips grew up in segregation in the southern United States. She was one of eight children. Her father, Reverend Robert Cam Wingfield, was a Baptist minister, and her mother, Rebecca Cooper Wingfield, did occasional domestic work. As a young girl the only white people Phillips knew were those who had employed her mother. Her parents were very supportive of her education, and attended local meetings of the Negro Parent Teachers Association. The Wingfields became more active with the civil rights movement after the Rosa Parks bus boycott in 1956. Her brother was part of the Nashville sit-ins and her family were one of the first to integrate into Nashville. Phillips attended an National Science Foundation summer school for African-American students, which inspired her to study chemistry. She and her boyfriend took part in a statewide mathematics competition 'for colored students'. She eventually majored in chemistry at Tennessee State University, but transferred to Vanderbilt University in 1966. While Phillips originally intended to study medicine, she was discouraged by her advisor who believed she would not be able to have a family and attend medical school. She pledged to the Alpha Kappa Alpha sorority and was listed in the Who's Who Among American High School Students. She studied chemistry at Vanderbilt University, where she was the first African-American woman to earn a Bachelor of Arts in 1967. Attending Vanderbilt University was the first time Phillips had white classmates and professors. After graduating, Phillips worked in psycho- pharmaceutical research. She completed her doctoral studies at the University of Cincinnati, and, again, was the first African-American woman in Cincinnati to earn a PhD in biochemistry. In 1973 the joined the American Chemical Society. She worked on the R17 virus, using circular dichroism and electron paramagnetic resonance to understand the conformation of the viral protein. Whilst researching the R17 virus, Phillips read about the work of Patrick Oriel at Dow Chemical Company, and decided to apply. == Career == After graduating, Phillips joined the Dow Chemical Company as a bench scientist. She developed circular dichroism and began to work on antibiotics and herbicides. At Dow Chemical Company Phillips helped students from Michigan State University to analyse the antibiotics in animal feed. She established how they might impact animal growth. She is responsible for several patents in the area, including one to improve lactation and another to improve feed utilisation. Phillips joined the Waters Corporation in 1984, where she worked in research and development until 1996. At Waters Corporation Phillips was a member of the Chemical Research and Development department, developing chromatography packing materials and bioseparations. Under her leadership the team developed the AccellPlus exchange packings, which could be used to separate proteins. She began to consult the biotechnology company Millipore Corp., travelling the world to talk about the work of the Waters Corporation. Her work expanded to include high-performance liquid chromatography. Phillips also investigated small molecules, including the drug sildenafil. She served as Clinical Marketing Director and Strategic Marketing Director. She was involved with the development of the Waters Corporation Symmetry columns and Oasis cartridges. After an almost thirty-year career, Phillips retired from the Waters Corporation in 2013. === Academic service === In 1990 Phillips became involved with the American Chemical Society Northeastern Section. She was involved with the American Chemical Society Project SEED, a scheme which allows high school students from disadvantaged backgrounds to complete summer placements in research laboratories. In 2013 Phillips was appointed Director- at-Large of the American Chemical Society. She was re-elected as Director-at- Large in 2016, and seeks to use her tenure to improve their 'globalization and diversity'. In 2017 Vanderbilt University created two faculty fellowships in her honour. The inaugural fellowship holder was Renã A. S. Robinson. === Awards and honours === Phillips' awards and honours include; * 1994 University of Cincinnati Distinguished Alumni * 2004 American Chemical Society Nashville Section Salute to Excellence Award * 2006 Vanderbilt University Unsung Heroine Award * 2006 American Chemical Society Northeastern Section Henry A. Hill Award * 2008 American Chemical Society Santa Clara Valley Section Shirley B.

It describes the principal conclusions of the Special Counsel investigation. The Barr letter is a four-page letter sent on March 24, 2019, from Attorney General William Barr to leaders of the House and Senate Judiciary Committees detailing the purported \\"principal conclusions\\" of the Mueller Report of the Special Counsel investigation led by Robert Mueller into Russian efforts to interfere in the 2016 United States presidential election, allegations of conspiracy or coordination between Donald Trump's presidential campaign and Russia, and allegations of obstruction of justice. After the release of the redacted report on April 18, 2019, Barr's letter was criticized as a deliberate mischaracterization of the Mueller Report and its conclusions, and as an attempt at spinning the media narrative to undermine Mueller's investigation. In March 2020, a federal judge sharply criticized Barr's characterizations and ordered the Justice Department to provide him the redacted portions from the public version of the Report so he could determine if they were justified. == Background == On May 17, 2017, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein appointed a special counsel, Robert Mueller, to investigate Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election and \\"any matters that arose or may arise directly from the investigation\\". Mueller concluded his investigations and sent a 448-page written report to Attorney General William Barr on March 22, 2019. Two days later, Barr sent a four-page letter to the leaders of the House and Senate Judiciary Committees detailing what he said were the report's principal conclusions on Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election, allegations of coordination between Donald Trump's presidential campaign and Russia, and allegations of obstruction of justice. On April 18, 2019, the Department of Justice released to the public a two-volume redacted version of Report on the Investigation into Russian Interference in the 2016 Presidential Election, informally known as the \\"Mueller Report\\". == Contents == Barr's letter describes the conclusions investigated by the Special Counsel investigation. It is split into two sections: Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election and allegations of obstruction of justice. === Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election === Barr's letter mentioned two methods found by the special counsel that Russia tried to do to influence the 2016 presidential election. First method: disinformation through social media campaigns by the Internet Research Agency (IRA) \\"to sow social discord\\"; and secondly, hacking computers for emails that came from the 2016 Clinton presidential campaign and Democratic National Committee. Barr quoted the report as saying the \\"investigation did not establish that members of the Trump Campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities.\\" === Obstruction of justice === Barr wrote that the special counsel \\"did not draw a conclusion – one way or the other – as to whether the examined conduct constituted obstruction\\"Barr letter p. 3: Special Counsel therefore did not draw a conclusion - one way or the other – as to whether the examined conduct constituted obstruction. and that \\"The Special Counsel's decision to describe the facts of his obstruction investigation without reaching any legal conclusions leaves it to the Attorney General to determine whether the conduct described in the report constitutes a crime\\".Barr letter p. 3: The Special Counsel's decision to describe the facts of his obstruction investigation without reaching any legal conclusions leaves it to the Attorney General to determine whether the conduct described in the report constitutes a crime. Barr concluded on obstruction of justice by saying: \\"Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and I have concluded that the evidence developed during the Special Counsel's investigation is not sufficient to establish that the President committed an obstruction-of-justice offense\\".Barr letter p. 3: Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and I have concluded that the evidence developed during the Special Counsel's investigation is not sufficient to establish that the President committed an obstruction-of-justice offense. Our determination was made without regard to, and is not based on, the constitutional considerations that surround the indictment and criminal prosecution of a sitting president. == Comparison between Barr memo and Barr letter == After the Barr letter was released, media commentators have pointed out that previously in June 2018, Barr (who was not working for the government then) wrote an unsolicited 19-page memo to the Department of Justice protesting that Mueller's investigation of President Trump for obstruction is \\"legally insupportable\\", and \\"fatally misconceived\\". The memo continued by saying that Trump was within his power to firstly ask then-FBI Director James Comey to stop investigating Michael Flynn, first and former National Security Advisor to Trump, and to secondly fire Comey. Barr further wrote that it would be detrimental to the institution of the presidency if Trump were accused of a crime when he fired Comey, a subordinate. Both the 2018 memo and the Barr letter argued that an underlying crime (in this case, \\"related to Russian election interference\\") was needed for obstruction to occur. Democrats referred to the memo in suggesting that Barr's decision on obstruction was biased. Time Magazine said \\"Barr has already realized some of Democrats' biggest fears\\", then went on to describe the memo. USA Today wrote that Barr's decision in the letter \\"rekindled concerns among Democratic lawmakers\\" about the memo, while CNN wrote that the Barr letter gave the memo \\"heightened relevance\\". Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein previously said that the memo had \\"no impact on the investigation\\", but The Guardian points to the memo as why Barr's decision on obstruction in the letter is \\"controversial\\". The New Yorker wrote that in light of Barr's decision in the Barr letter, the memo raises questions on whether Barr should have recused from the special counsel investigation, as it has already done before when Barr was nominated for Attorney General. The Los Angeles Times wrote that Barr used similar reasoning in both the 2018 memo and Barr letter, while NPR similarly wrote that the memo which \\"was a precursor to\\" the Barr letter. Regarding the decision on obstruction in the Barr letter, The Washington Post wrote that the memo \\"suggests Barr didn't think there was much of a case in the first place\\", while The Irish Times wrote that \\"Barr already made his views clear\\" earlier in the memo. == Comparison of findings between Barr letter and Mueller Report == After the release of the redacted report, Barr's letter was criticized as a deliberate mischaracterization of the Mueller Report and its conclusions, and as an attempt at spinning the media narrative to undermine Mueller's investigation. Numerous legal analysts concluded that Barr's letter did not accurately portray some of the findings of the investigation, casting Trump in a better light than was intended in the report. The New York Times reported instances in which the Barr letter omitted information and quoted sentence fragments out of context in ways that significantly altered the findings in the report, including: * Omission of language that indicated Trump could be subject to indictment after leaving office, inaccurately suggesting that Trump was \\"totally exonerated\\". * A sentence fragment described only one possible motive for Trump to obstruct justice, while the Mueller Report listed multiple possible motives. * Omission of words and a full sentence that twice suggested there was knowing and complicit behavior between the Trump campaign and Russians that stopped short of direct coordination, which may constitute conspiracy. CNN wrote that while Barr in his letter took it upon himself to deliver a ruling on whether Trump had committed obstruction, the redacted report indicates that Mueller intended that decision to be made by Congress, not Barr. Numerous other political and legal analysts, including Bob Woodward and Brian Williams, observed significant differences in what Barr said about Mueller's findings in his letter, and in his April 18 press conference, compared to what the Mueller Report actually found. This commentary included a comparison of Barr to Baghdad Bob, calling him \\"Baghdad Bill\\". Barr wrote that his letter provided \\"the principal conclusions\\" of the Mueller Report. Ryan Goodman, a professor at the New York University School of Law and co-editor of Just Security, observed that in 1989, Barr also wrote a letter which he stated contained \\"the principal conclusions\\" of a controversial legal opinion he worked on as head of the OLC. Barr declined to provide the full opinion to Congress, but it was later subpoenaed and released to the public, showing that the 1989 letter did not fully disclose the principal conclusions. == Reactions == === Robert Mueller === Letter from Robert Mueller III to William P. Barr objecting to Barr's characterization of the conclusions of the Mueller Report On March 25, a day after the Barr letter was released, Robert Mueller himself reportedly wrote a letter to Barr, as described in the New York Times as \\"expressing his and his team's concerns that the attorney general had inadequately portrayed their conclusions\\". In USA Today it was described that Mueller \\"expressed his differences with Barr\\". On March 27, Mueller sent Barr another letter describing his concerns of Barr's letter to Congress and the public on March 24. Mueller thought that Barr's letter \\"did not fully capture the context, nature, and substance\\" of the findings. \\"There is now public confusion about critical aspects of the results of our investigation. This threatens to undermine a central purpose for which the Department appointed the Special Counsel: to assure full public confidence in the outcome of the investigations.\\" Mueller also requested Barr release the Mueller Report's introductions and executive summaries. This was first reported on April 30, 2019. Letter from Attorney General William P. Barr on March 29 to the chairs of the House and Senate Judiciary Committees The next day on March 28, Mueller had a phone call with Barr and reportedly expressed concerns about public misunderstandings of the obstruction investigation due to a lack of context released by Barr's letter. In their phone conversation, Barr reportedly said that his letter was not intended to be a summary, but rather only as a description of the principal findings of Mueller's report, and said he preferred not to release more information until a more complete redacted version of the report could be prepared. Barr then sent a subsequent letter to Congress in which he reiterated that his letter had not been intended as a summary of the Mueller Report and volunteered to testify before Congress in early May. === Some members of the special counsel team === On April 3, 2019, some members of the Mueller investigation team, who spoke on condition of anonymity, expressed concerns to the press that Barr's letter did not accurately portray some of the findings of the investigation, casting Trump in a better light than was intended in the report. === President Donald Trump === On Barr's decision to clear him on obstruction, Trump said in late April 2019 that Barr read the Mueller Report \\"and he made a decision right on the spot. No obstruction.\\" === Members of Congress === In a joint statement, Democrats House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said that Barr is \\"not a neutral observer\\". They also said that Barr's past \\"bias\\" against the special counsel (Barr's memo) showed that he was \\"not in a position to make objective determinations\\". Then-Republican congressman Justin Amash (who in July 2019 left the Republican Party and became an Independent) stated in May 2019 \\"it is clear that Barr intended to mislead the public about Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s analysis and findings,\\" adding, \\"Barr’s misrepresentations are significant but often subtle, frequently taking the form of sleight-of-hand qualifications or logical fallacies, which he hopes people will not notice.\\" In his own statement, Republican House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy declared, based on the conclusions in the Barr Letter and the vast scope and resources made available to Mueller, that \\"This case is closed.\\" McCarthy emphasized the need to move on from the investigation \\"after months upon months of manufactured outrage.\\" === Federal Judge Reggie Walton === On March 5, 2020, Reggie Walton, a senior judge of the DC district court, sharply criticized Barr's characterizations of the Mueller Report as \\"distorted\\" and \\"misleading\\" and called \\"into question Attorney General Barr’s credibility and, in turn, the department’s\\" representations to the Court. Walton asked if Barr's characterizations were a \\"calculated attempt\\" to help the president. He ordered the Justice Department to show him the redacted portions from the public version of the Report so he could determine if they were justified. == See also == * Mueller Report § Mueller Report findings compared to Barr letter == References == == External links == * Mueller Report, redacted version publicly released April 18, 2019: :*Report on the Investigation into Russian Interference in the 2016 Presidential Election * Attorney General William Barr's four-page letter to leaders of the House and Senate Judiciary Committees of the principal conclusions of the Mueller investigation (March 24, 2019) Category:2019 documents Category:2019 in American law Category:2019 in American politics Category:Aftermath of the 2016 United States presidential election Category:Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections Category:United States Department of Justice Category:United States documents ","title":"Barr letter"},{"id":"60357224","text":"Kingdom of Gwynedd c.620, showing cantrefi Rhosyr was the name of one of the three medieval cantrefs (meaning a hundred towns) on the island of Anglesey, north Wales, in the Kingdom of Gwynedd.

It chronicles the struggles of undocumented immigrant workers as they attempt to achieve fair wages and better working conditions in New York’s Upper East Side. Since its premiere at the Full Frames Festival in January 2014, the film has received acclaim from critics as well as multiple awards including a nomination for the 2017 Outstanding Business and Economic Documentary Emmy. == Plot summary == The film focuses on a group of undocumented immigrants who prepare and serve food and coffee to residents of New York’s Upper East Side. The Cafe at which they work, 63rd Street Hot and Crusty, appears from the outside to be a fair and efficient business, however, the film reveals a situation in which workers face sub-legal wages, dangerous machinery and abusive managers who will fire them for calling in sick. In January 2012, led by sandwich maker Mahoma Lopez, the group unionised in an attempt to get their voice heard and achieve fair working conditions. With the assistance of a number of inspired organisers from the Occupy Wall Street movement, the workers risk deportation and the loss of their livelihood as they embark on a year-long battle for a living wage against reluctant New York City investors. Their plight is complicated when their complaint to the New York State Department of Labor is ignored, as well as their requests to join larger unions on the grounds that their restaurant is too small. Their case is fought in court and on the streets as they endeavour to promote a greater recognition of undocumented workers within the United States' economy, and the injustices they currently face. == Cast == * Virgilio Arán - Himself * Benjamin Dictor - Himself * Diego Ibanez - Himself * Gonzalo Jimenez - Himself * Elizabeth Lopez - Herself * Mahoma Lopez - Himself * Margarito Lopez - Himself * Nastraran Mohit - Herself * Diana Ortiz - Herself * Rosanna Rodriguez - Herself * Felicito Tapia - Himself == Production == The film was produced by Jubilee Productions who operated under an estimated budget of $370,000. The film was almost entirely shot in New York City. == Release == The film debuted in April 2014 at the 22nd Annual Full Frame Documentary Film Festival held in Durham, North Carolina where it won the Audience Award. == Reception == === Critical response === The Hand That Feeds Us received critical acclaim, with a 93% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 14 reviews and an audience approval rating of 80% based on 125 user reviews. On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 60 out of 100, indicating \\"generally favourable reviews\\". In a positive review for The New York Times, Ben Kenisberg complimented Blotnick and Lears’ ability to illuminate an important political issue, lauding the film as \\"an effective portrayal of the intricacies of activism – and of a situation in which victories seem all too brief.\\" Similarly, Peter Keough of The Boston Globe commends the positive motivation for the film and the intelligent delivery of its message, claiming it to be “socially conscious documentary film-making at its best.” Further, Diana Clark of The Village Voice applauded the documentary’s entertainment value, writing that it was \\"filmed with the urgency and suspense of a Hitchcock thriller.\\" However, despite the vast majority of critical reviews praising both the political message of the film and the technical prowess of its makers, it has induced some more negative responses. Such reviews predominately have issue with the imbalance of opinions represented in the film. Martin Tsai for the Los Angeles Times articulates this concern by claiming that \\"when the employer declined an interview, the filmmakers could have - but apparently didn’t - reach out to unaffiliated legal or labor experts for comment. Instead, we got lots of blurred-out signs, unnamed parties, first-name-only interviewees, pointless establishing shots and a manipulative score.\\" Further, he believes the film “barely substantiates the hardships of workers and does not put their quality of life into any kind of statistical perspective.” === Accolades === * DOC NYC (2014) - Audience award, Full Frame Documentary Film Festival (2014) - Audience Award (Won) * Sidewalk Film Festival (2014) - Best Documentary (Won) * Emmy Award (2017) - Outstanding Business and Economic Documentary (Nominated) * Cleveland International Film Festival (2014) - Greg Gund Memorial Standing Up Award (Nominated) * DOC NYC (2014) - Metropolis Grand Jury Prize (Nominated) == Political Significance == === Improper Entrance and Unlawful Presence === Under United States federal criminal law, it is a misdemeanour for a non-citizen to enter or attempt to enter the United States at any time or place other than designated by immigration officers, elude examination or inspection by immigration officers, or attempt to enter or obtain entry to the United States by wilfully concealing, falsifying, or misrepresenting material facts. Although some of the workers who were a part of the union in the film lacked legal status, as far as the film shows, none of them were guilty of improper entry. A vast number of foreigners enter the United States legally but then fail to renew their visa or leave the country before their original visa expires. However, merely being unlawfully present in the country is not a crime. Although it is a breach of federal immigration law to remain in the country, it is not punishable by criminal penalties, but rather civil ones. According to a study conducted by the Pew Research Center of the approximately 11 million immigrants unlawfully present in the United States, nearly 8 million of them are active in the labor force. Their representation by industry is pronounced, making up over half of the hired labor on farms and 9% of jobs in the service sector. The majority of these service sector jobs are in domestic help and fast food. Overall, unlawful immigrants make up approximately 5% of the American labor force. The Hand That Feeds presents the issues surrounding the rights of unlawful immigrants and their impact on the American economy from the perspective of such workers. === Occupy Wall Street === Occupy Wall Street protestors – Credit: David Shankbone Occupy Wall Street (OWS) is a left-wing protest movement that began on September 17, 2011, in Zuccotti Park, located in New York City's Wall Street financial district, against economic inequality. The movement was initiated by Canadian anti-consumerist magazine Adbusters in response to concerns over social and economic inequality, corruption and the unreasonable influence of corporations on government, specifically from the financial services sector. The OWS slogan, \\"We are the 99%\\", is a comment on the vast income disparity between the wealthiest 1% of Americans and the rest of the population. Protests were largely performed in Zuccotti Park until on November 15, 2011, the group was forced to relocate. Protesters shifted their focus to occupying banks, corporate headquarters and university campuses. Members of the OWS finance committee initiated a process to streamline the movement by carefully allocating funds to worthy \\"working groups\\". Although the film does not reveal the full extent of OWS' involvement in the lives of the workers in the film, at the very least a \\"working group\\" of OWS advocates are shown to be proving financial and logistical support to the workers of 63rd Street Hot and Crusty in their quest for fair wages and better working conditions. === Changing The Food Chain === Changing The Food Chain is a collaboration between Food Chain Workers Alliance and The Hand That Feeds. An online interactive map aims to facilitate community engagement with organisations that support workers in the American food industry. Both The Food Chain Workers Alliance and the makers of the film recognise the importance of developing a more sustainable food system in the United States in order to ensure a desirable level of wellbeing amongst workers, employers and consumers. This is evident in the size and growth rate of the food sector in the US economy. With the food system comprising approximately 20 million workers, one in six US workers are employed within the food sector, making it the single largest private-sector employer in the country. Organisations within Changing The Food Chain are divided into four different categories. * Work Centres: Organisations that provide assistance to low-wage, often immigrant workers who are not represented by a union or similar advocacy bodies or those who are not subject to labor laws. * Advocacy Groups: Any group seeking to promote the agendas of the public in order to affect policy change at the local, state and national level. * Service Organisations: Organisations that provide services such as legal assistance, education or real estate agency. * Unions: Organisations that are legally recognised to equip groups of workers with collective bargaining powers when disputing issues regarding working conditions, wages and contract violations. Changing The Food Chain implores those that are interested in contributing to the cause to find an organisation near you, learn more about local issues, learn your rights, organise your workplace, become a community supporter, advocate for change and finally actualise the movement. == References == == External links == * * The Hand That Feeds at IMDb Category:2014 documentary films Category:American docufiction films Category:American films Category:Documentary films about labor relations in the United States ","title":"The Hand That Feeds (film)"},{"id":"60357269","text":"Xingjing may refer to: *Xingjing, Ningxia (兴泾), a town in Xixia District, Yinchuan, Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, China *Hetu Ala, the capital of Later Jin (1616–1636), also known as Xingjing (興京) after 1636, located in Xinbin Manchu Autonomous County, Liaoning, China *Gun Metal Grey (刑警), a 2010 Hong Kong TV series ==See also== *Xinjing (disambiguation) ","title":"Xingjing"},{"id":"60357293","text":"Fasching in 2012.

Stephen was of Persian origin. In 694, he was ordered to oversee the construction projects of Justinian II, including at the Great Palace of Constantinople. Later Byzantine writers (Nikephoros I of Constantinople and Theophanes the Confessor), were hostile towards him. Nikephoros described Stephen as \\"lordly and authoritative, exceedingly bloodthirsty and cruel\\". Theophanes wrote that he was extremely cruel towards the workmen assigned to the building projects. He was also said to be brutal in his behavior towards the mother of Justinian II, Anastasia. According to Theophanes, he beat her while Justinian was away. He mistreated the citizens of Constantinople in a harsh manner in general; this contributed greatly to the public dissatisfaction with Justinian II. In 695, Justinian II was overthrown by his own citizens and forced into exile. During the chaos that erupted an angry mob captured Stephen, dragged him along the Mese to the Forum of the Ox, and burned him alive. ==References== ==Sources== * * Category:695 deaths Category:7th-century Byzantine people Category:Byzantine officials Category:Byzantine people of Iranian descent Category:7th-century Iranian people Category:Byzantine eunuchs Category:People executed by burning ","title":"Stephen the Persian"},{"id":"60357370","text":"Shurtz is a surname.

He has released numerous EPs, mixtapes, and albums. His most recent album Mariposa was released March 13, 2020 on Same Plate/Sony. ==Early life and education== Christian Felner was born and grew up in Trumbull, Connecticut. He graduated high school from Fairfield College Preparatory School in Fairfield, Connecticut in 2013. He was an avid snowboarder at Okemo Mountain. He began releasing music while still in high school, and also built a following on YouTube by making and selling beats. After graduating, he went on to attend the University of Southern California (USC) where he studied music. While in college, Felly founded 2273 Records with fellow USC attendees Jake Standley and Gyyps (with whom Felly frequently collaborates). He graduated from USC in 2017. ==Career== While still attending USC, Felly released several mixtapes and an EP. His first project to receive major attention came in May 2014 with the release of Waking Up To Sirens, which featured the single \\"Fabrics\\". This led to an appearance as an opener for Madlib. He followed that with a second mixtape, Milk & Sugar, which was released in November 2014. That collection featured a guest appearance from Ari Lennox on the track, \\"Tell Me\\". His third mixtape, This Shit Comes in Waves, was released in July 2015, and featured the single \\"7th King\\". That song was the namesake for his 2016 tour (the \\"7th King Tour\\") which ran for 21 dates in the U.S. In July 2016, Felly released an EP entitled, Young Fel, and embarked on another tour in support of it. That collection featured the single \\"Desert Eagle\\" (featuring Gyyps), for which Felly filmed a music video. In 2017, he would embark on the \\"Mermaid Gang\\" tour, which was named after the group formed by Felly, Gyyps, and Trip Carter. All three members performed on stage during the 40-date tour. Throughout 2017, Felly released numerous songs including \\"Ali\\", \\"Baby Boy\\", \\"Fight the Feeling\\", \\"Delta Deathbus to Zion\\" (featuring Peter $un), \\"Hotel Room\\", \\"Keep The Team Straight\\", and numerous others. Some of the tracks were part of a summer series called New Flavors which saw Felly release a new song each Wednesday over that summer. In August 2017, he released his first studio album, Wild Strawberries, as a Cinematic Music Group signee. The album featured the singles \\"Baby Boy\\", \\"Bag Season\\" (featuring Trip Carter), and \\"Wide Angle\\" (featuring Konshens). It also featured other guest appearances from Gyyps and Frex. In the fall of 2017, Felly opened for T-Pain for two nights on his \\"Acoustic Tour\\". Felly then embarked on his own 20-date \\"Strawberry Season Tour\\". In March 2018, he released an EP called, Winters in Brooklyn featuring the single, \\"BLANCO\\". In September of that year, it was announced that Felly had been signed to Same Plate Entertainment, a joint venture with Sony Music. He released his first project on that label (Surf Trap) later that month. The lead single off the album was \\"Pretty Girl\\" followed by \\"Miami\\". In 2019, Felly continued releasing new music with tracks like \\"At Fault\\" (with Medasin) and \\"Cheap Cheap\\" (with Jack Harlow). He was also featured on the MAX song, \\"Acid Dreams\\", which was released in July 2019. In October of that year, Felly released the single, \\"Heartstrings\\", which featured Carlos Santana on guitar. ==Discography== ===Studio albums=== { class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text-align:center;\\" + List of studio albums, with year released and selected details ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:11em;\\"  Title ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:16em;\\"  Album details -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\" Surf Trap  * Released: September 28, 2018 * Label: Same Plate/Sony * Format: Digital download -  style=\\"text- align:left;\\" Mariposa  * Released: March 13, 2020 * Label: Same Plate Entertainment * Format: Digital download - } ===Mixtapes=== { class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text-align:center;\\" + List of mixtapes, with year released and selected details ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:11em;\\"  Title ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:16em;\\"  Album details -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\" Waking up to Sirens  * Released: May 5, 2014 * Label: 2273 Records * Format: Digital download -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\" Milk & Sugar  * Released: November 6, 2014 * Label: 2273 Records * Format: Digital download -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\" This Shit Comes in Waves  * Released: July 27, 2015 * Label: 2273 Records * Format: Digital download -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\" Wild Strawberries  * Released: August 18, 2017 * Label: Cinematic Music Group * Format: Digital download - } === EPs === { class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text-align:center;\\" + List of EPs, with year released and selected details ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:11em;\\"  Title ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:16em;\\"  Album details -  style=\\"text- align:left;\\" Young Fel  * Released: July 22, 2016 * Label: 2273 Records * Format: Digital download -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\" Winters in Brooklyn  * Released: March 14, 2018 * Label: 2273 Records * Format: Digital download - } ===Singles=== { class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text- align:center;\\" + List of singles with selected details ! scope=\\"col\\" Title ! scope=\\"col\\" Year ! scope=\\"col\\" Album - ! scope=\\"row\\" \\"Fabrics\\"  rowspan=\\"3\\" 2014  Waking up to Sirens - ! scope=\\"row\\" \\"Probation\\"  rowspan=\\"2\\" Milk & Sugar - ! scope=\\"row\\" \\"Schoolzones\\" - ! scope=\\"row\\" \\"7th King\\"  2015  This Shit Comes in Waves - ! scope=\\"row\\" \\"Desert Eagle\\" (feat.

It is located on in Paradise, Nevada, in the Las Vegas Valley. Newton initially purchased five vacant acres of the property in 1966 and gradually expanded it with several houses, including a mansion completed in 1978. In 2010, Newton proposed turning the estate into a public attraction, an idea that received opposition from nearby residents who had concerns about the traffic that such a project would bring. Newton's proposal was approved by county officials, but was delayed in 2012, when his business partner on the project, CSD LLC, filed a lawsuit against him, alleging that he and his family had interfered in the development plans. After legal issues were resolved, the property was put up for sale in 2013 and again in 2014. The estate ultimately opened as a public attraction on September 18, 2015, with Newton's involvement. It closed for renovations on April 24, 2018. Newton said the property would reopen to the public, although he and his wife subsequently withdrew the permits for the attraction in July 2018. It was sold in 2019 to Smoketree LLC, which put it up for sale a year later. ==History== Singer Wayne Newton initially purchased five acres of the site in 1966. The site was vacant at the time. As of 1967, the Casa de Shenandoah ranch included a stable and riding corral. Newton, his parents, and his brother and sister-in-law lived in a guest house on the ranch, while a main house was in the planning stage. Newton had ten horses living on the ranch, as well as a pack of dogs. Newton's wife, Elaine, would also live at the ranch following the couple's marriage in 1968. At the time, the ranch included a Learjet plane on the site. Additional acreage was acquired between 1969 and 1972. The ranch would ultimately consist of . As of 1970, Newton had an Arabian horse-breeding stable on the ranch. Newton would later breed his Arabian horses at a separate ranch elsewhere in Nevada, where the remainder of his horses would be kept. By 1973, the ranch had three houses and a horse hospital. As of 1976, Casa de Shenandoah was home to 120 Arabian horses. The ranch would later include a heliport and a dozen automobiles in various garages located on the estate. Newton's on-site automobile collection included Rolls-Royces, and a 1929 Duesenberg that once belonged to Howard Hughes, a former boss of Newton. In addition, Casa de Shenandoah has artesian wells and lakes. As of 1976, work was underway on a new house for the ranch. At the time, Newton and his wife lived in a six-bedroom ranch house on the property, and his parents lived in a separate house, also on the land. As of 1978, construction was nearing completion on a $4 million southern-style mansion on the site. The mansion was designed by Newton, who denied that it was meant as a replica of the Tara plantation featured in Gone with the Wind. After the mansion's completion, Newton's then-wife decorated each room of the building except for his office, known as the Red Room, where Newton conducted media interviews. The room featured red velvet walls, and contained Newton's various plaques and awards, as well as memorabilia. As of 1979, Newton and his parents lived on the ranch along with approximately 70 servants and aides. By that time, Newton also had various animals freely roaming on the property, including deer, dogs, ducks, swans, and wallabies, as well as peacocks which frequented the property's lakes. Newton's eventual spokeswoman and sister-in- law, Tricia McCrone, said, \\"People have actually dropped their animals over the wall, hearing it's an animal sanctuary — especially bunnies after Easter.\\" U.S. President Ronald Reagan attended a political fundraiser at the ranch in 1982. At the time, the ranch had eight separate homes, including the mansion. Newton married Kathleen McCrone at the estate in April 1994. Newton also hosted private weddings there. In August 2000, a brush fire at the nearby Sunset Park went over a 10-foot wall and onto Newton's property, burning an acre of land. Animals on the property were moved to safety by the staff, and Newton's collection of vintage Rolls-Royce vehicles were driven away from the garage to a secure part of the property. The fire on Newton's property was quickly extinguished, although embers on the land reignited twice later in the night. Newton and his family were in Boston at the time for one of his performances. In 2008, CBS News named Casa de Shenandoah as one of the top five homes in the country, while MTV Cribs called it one of the top three \\"priciest pads\\". Bruton Smith, a former friend of Newton's, filed a lawsuit against him in February 2010, alleging that Newton owed $3.3 million on a loan. Smith sought to foreclose on Casa de Shenandoah, but the case was voluntarily dismissed later that year. Subsequently, a complaint was filed against Newton's recent storage of his Fokker F-28 jet plane on the property. ===Attraction=== In June 2010, CSD LLC purchased the estate for $18.7 million, along with ten additional acres across the street for a further $10 million. Lacy and Dorothy Harber, residents of Texas, were majority owners of CSD, while the Newtons became 20 percent partners in the company. Steve Kennedy and his ex-girlfriend/business partner Geneva Clark split the remaining 10 percent of company ownership. CSD and the Newtons had plans to open Casa de Shenandoah as a public attraction with tours going through the property. Newton said that \\"a lot of people have written and want to see what the property looks like, and my wife said that if you have something so special, it should be shared.\\" The partnership agreement between CSD and the Newtons ranked among the largest Las Vegas real estate deals of the decade. Prior to signing the deal with CSD, Newton had already filmed hundreds of hours of commentary about his various memorabilia. Since May 2010, Newton's friend Rudy Ruettiger had been involved in shooting a documentary on the ranch's transformation into an attraction. CSD became the landlord of the Newtons, charging a lease fee of $1 per month until the completion of a new house on the property for the Newtons to live in. CSD agreed to pay $2 million to build the new home, which would not be part of the public attraction. The private home would be built on the back of the property, and Newton and his family would live there while tours were being given of the main house, which contained . The plans for Casa de Shenandoah were announced in September 2010. Tours would include Newton's garage of automobiles and his Fokker jet, while shuttle tours of the ranch would feature Newton's zoo of animals, including African penguins, peacocks, and more than 70 Arabian horses. In addition to tours, the project would include a dinner theater, museum, and a gift shop, all of which would be located on the ten acres. The museum would be a larger version of the Red Room, and would include items from Newton's career and from other entertainers affiliated with Las Vegas. Newton described it as a hall of fame for people such as Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, and Sammy Davis Jr. Newton said entertainers would be added to the hall of fame each year, and mentioned the possibility of a television special focusing on it. The 600-seat theater would be designed like Newton's favorite showroom, the Copa Room at the Sands Hotel and Casino. Newton would be the primary headliner. The museum and theater would be located in a vacant building that previously operated as the Napa Valley Pottery and Floral store. A neighborhood meeting on the project was held later in September 2010. A film crew from Ruettiger's production company attended the meeting, where the project received unanimous opposition from nearby residents. Newton's home was located in a neighborhood designated for rural preservation, and residents expressed concern about shuttle bus traffic for the new project, although the site of the proposed museum and theater was already zoned for commercial use, and Newton's home would only require a special-use permit for tours. In October 2010, Kennedy and CSD filed a lawsuit against M.J. Harvey, a longtime Paradise township activist, alleging that she repeatedly made false statements about how the project could affect homeowners and nearby communities. The lawsuit alleged that Harvey did so \\"with the intent of denying the project the necessary community endorsements.\\" Later that month, the Paradise Town Advisory Board recommended against the project, citing concerns about tourism and heavy traffic in the rural area. The board also recommended against a proposal by Newton to privatize Tomiyasu Lane, located along the west side of Casa de Shenandoah, in an effort to contain traffic. Newton stated he would pay for the road proposal, although residents along Tomiyasu opposed the idea. CSD planned to build the museum regardless of neighborhood opposition. The project would create 400 jobs. According to Newton, opponents of the project referred to it as \\"Graceland West\\", in reference to Elvis Presley's Graceland. Newton said, \\"Elvis was a dear friend, but to use Graceland as a way to promote what we're doing would not be right. It's Shenandoah, and it will always be Shenandoah.\\" During the town board meeting, 33 people spoke against the project, with 11 speaking in favor. Despite the board's recommendation, the Clark County Commission approved the project in November 2010. To alleviate concerns from residents, the public entrance to Casa de Shenandoah would be on Sunset Road instead of Tomiyasu Lane. Plans for a wedding pavilion were scrapped entirely, although Newton would continue to host private weddings at the estate. Casa de Shenandoah was originally intended to open as an attraction in February 2011, although work proceeded slowly on the project following the approval. The museum was later expected to be open by the end of 2011. In October 2011, Newton said he expected the estate to be opened for public tours by February 2012. ====Legal issues==== Work on the project was halted in May 2012, when CSD filed a lawsuit against Newton. The lawsuit alleged that: * Newton and his family had interfered with the development plans, stating that they refused to move out of the mansion and that they refused to allow their new private residence on the property to be built. * Newton refused to catalog and turn over personal property and memorabilia for the museum. * Newton refused to remove horses from the property; he had 55 horses there, whereas CSD stated that less than 20 would be needed for the new project. * Newton allegedly sexually harassed a young woman who had been hired by CSD to take care of and train the horses. * Newton had various large dogs freely roaming the property; the lawsuit alleged that they had bitten people multiple times and that Newton refused to remove them to allow for the opening of the museum. Newton's attorney denied that the allegations were true, and stated that CSD was to blame for failure to get the museum and new residence built. Another allegation, stating that Newton's animals were not properly cared for, was also denied. Clark declined to get involved in the lawsuit, stating that Kennedy \\"is wrongly accusing the Newtons and mismanaging his role of leadership. I will not condone nor support his actions or anyone who is supporting him with this lawsuit.\\" The Newtons countersued, alleging that Kennedy had entered their house without permission and that they had been locked out of their horse barn. They also alleged that a computer with their business files had been taken from Newton's home office. A temporary restraining order was issued against Kennedy, who was not to come within 50 feet of the family and the estate. Newton stated that the project would not proceed with Kennedy as manager, and that he regretted entering into the deal with him. There was the possibility that the project would be revived with new investors. A horse at the ranch (2016) In June 2012, a county judge denied CSD's motion to move some of the estate's horses to another location. CSD stated that it had spent approximately $888,000 to feed and care for the horses. CSD also stated that there should only be about 10 to 15 horses on the property, which consisted of about 15 acres of grazing land; the property contained 51 Arabian horses. CSD had been spending $37,000 in monthly costs for the horses, and stated that it could not afford to continue doing so. Up to that time, CSD had spent $50 million on the project. Later in June 2012, CSD members voted to call the new project \\"The Fabulous Las Vegas Museum\\". During the same month, the Newtons posted a $5,000 bond as protection for economic damages that CSD could suffer during litigation. This was later increased to $50,000. In July 2012, as a result of the horse ruling, CSD sought a $1 million loan to continue taking care of the Arabian horse herd. The Newtons stated that CSD had sufficient funds for horse upkeep without a loan. The Newtons' attorney stated that the terms of the loan were set to allow a limited liability company to foreclose on the loan and take over the property in the event that the loan is not repaid within 30 days. Later in the month, CSD alleged that the Newton family was experiencing financial difficulty when they sold the property, and that they had no real intention to cooperate with the plans to turn it into an attraction. The Newtons and Kennedy also accused each other of posing a threat to one another. In August 2012, CSD requested court approval to dissolve the management company that was to create the attraction. Such an action would give CSD complete ownership of the property. Approval of the request was delayed until December 2012, to give the Newtons time to gather facts to refute CSD. That month, CSD sought a patent for a \\"Welcome to the Fabulous Las Vegas Museum\\" sign, while the Newtons wanted the museum to retain its intended focus on Wayne Newton. In October 2012, a three-week jury trial between Newton and CSD LLC was set for May 2013. Later that month, CSD LLC was placed into Chapter 11 bankruptcy, and the company dropped its plans for the attraction. In December 2012, a bankruptcy court judge approved the ranch and 13 acres across the street to be sold. The property was valued at $50.8 million. In February 2013, CSD filed a lawsuit stating that the Newtons were micromanagers who repeatedly obstructed progress on the project. The lawsuit alleged that the Newtons demanded the location of their new house to be moved \\"several feet in one direction, and then several feet in another,\\" and that they subsequently requested $5 million for the home's construction, more than the allotted $2 million. The lawsuit also stated that Newton refused to provide his personal property for the planned museum, and that he and his wife complained repeatedly about the contractors and subcontractors hired to work on the project. The lawsuit was dismissed later that year. In March 2013, CSD LLC received permission from a bankruptcy court to sell the ranch's approximately 280 exotic birds, fish and mammals for $27,300, to the Zoological Wildlife Conservation Center and the Sloth Captive Husbandry Research Center in Rainier, Oregon. Later that month, a bankruptcy court judge sealed the case concerning CSD's bankruptcy. Kathleen Newton stated that the family would continue living in the house if it were sold. At the time, her sister also lived in a house on the property, while Newton's 92-year-old longtime personal secretary lived in a third house on the site. In April 2013, the Newtons, the Harbers, Kennedy, and others reached a settlement, resulting in the lawsuits being resolved. ====Further developments==== Newton and his family moved out of Casa de Shenandoah in June 2013, after purchasing new residential property nearby. Newton later said he was relieved when he and his family moved out of the estate, stating, \\"By the time we got to the point of leaving, I had had enough of the toll it was taking on my family. We had been fighting in court for a long time. [...] It just wasn't worth it anymore.\\" Under CSD's bankruptcy reorganization plan, Lacy Harber would own the entire company and would have full control of Casa de Shenandoah. The reorganization plan was approved later in June 2013, and the company intended to proceed with its plans to open the property as an attraction later in the summer. However, several aspects would now be absent, including Newton's animals and the museum of memorabilia. The Harbers spent up to $20 million in renovations to the property over the next several months, including new flooring, bathrooms, hardware, stair railing, landscaping, and wallpaper. In September 2013, the Harbers put Casa de Shenandoah up for sale at a cost of $70 million, making it one of the most expensive homes for sale in the Las Vegas Valley. The property sale would include eight homes, various horse stables, ponds, and a private jet. In December 2013, the property was renamed Sunset Springs Ranch. In July 2014, CSD had plans to add a wedding chapel to the property. The ranch was put up for sale again in September 2014, at a cost of $30 million. The ranch was expected to be sold to a housing developer which would build up to 80 homes on the land. Nearly 1,000 people signed a petition to have the ranch designated a historical site. Later in September 2014, Lacy Harber contacted the Newtons with a proposal for them to work out a deal and reclaim the property, an idea which the Newtons accepted. This ended plans for the housing subdivision, and Newton later said about the property, \\"This really is a piece of Las Vegas history. It would be a shame for it to be turned into something else.\\" In December 2014, the \\"Casa de Shenandoah\\" name was restored, and the Newtons planned to revive the attraction project, while also planning to eventually reside on the property again. The Harbers spent more than $100 million to renovate Casa de Shenandoah into a museum. ====Operation==== A VIP party was held on the night of September 17, 2015, ahead of the public opening the following day. Attendees to the VIP party included Carrot Top, Clint Holmes, Lance Burton, Robert Torti, Sabrina Bryan, and the Harbers. At the time of the opening, Newton said, \\"Nobody thought we'd be back here. When we moved out, I never thought I'd be back here, either.\\" The Newtons continued living at their newer house following the public opening of Casa de Shenandoah, although Wayne Newton visited the ranch every day. Within five days of its opening, approximately 400 people had visited the ranch daily. The newly built Visitor Center across from the ranch contained Newton's memorabilia, shops, and a short documentary film about Newton's life and the creation of Casa de Shenandoah. The video tour was narrated by Newton, while a VIP package featured Newton himself as the tour guide. Three shops were each respectively named after Newton, his wife, and their daughter: Wayne's World, Kat's Korner, and Lauren's Lair. Customers were shuttled from the visitor center to the estate. Newton's automobile collection (2016) Featured on the tour was Newton's collection of 13 rare automobiles, mostly consisting of Rolls-Royces and Bentleys. The collection included vehicles owned by Johnny Carson and Liberace, and two one- of-a-kind cars: a 1934 Rolls-Royce and a 1983 Mercedes-Benz. Also featured on the tour was Newton's Native American artifact collection, his private jet, armed forces items, and letters he received from U.S. presidents. Newton's memorabilia dated back 60 years. The property contains of grass, and the tour also featured Newton's zoo of animals. In November 2016, neighbors of the estate complained of peacocks being a nuisance. Newton's attorney said the peacocks were not Newton's responsibility, stating that the animals were already present in the area when Newton bought the property in the 1960s. CSD LLC was allowed to hold events on the ranch under strict guidelines set by the county. This included no outdoor loudspeakers, no alcohol sales, and no events after dark. CSD also could not charge for events. However, these rules would later be ignored, and neighbors subsequently complained about events at the property for reasons such as loud music and traffic congestion. County commissioner Jim Gibson said CSD was \\"doing things well beyond what they were authorized to do.\\" In early November 2017, the Nevada District Office of the Small Business Administration (SBA) held a banquet on the property, an event which included a $1,500 cash bar. Neighbors complained that the event utilized loudspeakers and that it lasted after dark, prompting an investigation by county code enforcement officials. The SBA also opened an investigation into the event, as SBA money was illegally used to pay for alcohol at the event. Subsequent controversial events held at the ranch included a $10,000 wedding and a car show. In April 2018, more than 1,200 people attended a dining and dancing event that included live music until 9:30 p.m. Casa de Shenandoah closed to the public on April 24, 2018, although the estate continued to host a few more events into the next month. Newton said the closure was necessary to allow for renovations, which could not take place with tours ongoing. He said the property would reopen as soon as possible. However, on July 10, 2018, the Newtons withdrew the permits used for the property's museum and tour operations. Newton said, \\"As of now, we are just taking a breather and deciding what we want to do in the future. We have not wanted to make any rush decisions.\\" Cosmetic work on the property, including exterior painting, would continue. During the same month, CSD stated it would not use the property as a museum or event space for at least a year. The animals were required to be relocated by mid-September 2018. ===2019 sale and subsequent legal issues=== Casa de Shenandoah was sold to Smoketree LLC in July 2019, for $5.56 million. Earlier that year, Newton had offered to buy back the estate for $6 million. Although he thought an agreement had been reached, he was disappointed to later learn that the estate was being sold to another buyer. In August 2019, Newton took legal action against Smoketree, who believed that the purchase included the estate's contents. Newton denied that this was the case, and he sought to retrieve property from the estate such as antiques, art, and personal items. The visitor center and its 10-acre site were sold in September 2019, to Harsch Investment Properties. In February 2020, Newton won a preliminary battle to reacquire his belongings. Newton also owned the \\"Case de Shenandoah\\" name, which was removed from the estate. In August 2019, a woman sued Newton and CSD over an alleged incident that occurred at the estate in 2017, in which her teenage daughter was bitten by his pet capuchin monkey while on the tour. Newton's wife stated that the family was not directly involved with estate operations at the time of the incident and had no knowledge of it. In April 2020, a woman filed a second lawsuit against Newton, claiming that she too had been bitten by his pet monkey during a tour in 2018. In August 2020, Smoketree put the estate up for sale at a cost of $29.9 million. ==In popular culture== A 90-minute television program, The Wayne Newton Special, was filmed at Casa de Shenandoah in 1974, and aired later that year on NBC. The ranch was also featured in The Rockford Files and Vega$. Casa de Shenandoah and Newton appear in the 1997 film Vegas Vacation. In June 2005, Newton filmed a series of introductions for Total Request Live that involved the ranch's various animals. The ranch was featured as the finishing point in the finale of The Amazing Race 15 in 2009.

They had two children (also named as appellants), neither of whom were Irish citizens. Ms Sivsivadze, at the time of the hearing, had been granted leave by the Minister for Justice to remain in Ireland, temporarily, on humanitarian grounds. During the course of the hearing, Ms Sivsivadze admitted that she had concocted a false story in order to obtain her permission to remain in Ireland. Her husband, Davit Arabuli, had arrived in Ireland in 2001. In December 2001, the Minister made an order for Mr Arabuli's deportation under s3(1) of the 1999 Act, but \\"through various deceptive means Aribuli avoided deportation until November 2011.\\" The appeal to the Supreme Court focused on s 3(1) of the 1999 Act, under which the Minister for Justice can order the deportation of a non-national (who has no permission to remain in the State) for an indefinite period. The appellants had already unsuccessfully challenged the constitutionality of this section and s3(11) of the 1999 Act in the High Court, and had been refused a declaration that s3(1) and s3(11) of the 1999 Act were incompatible with Ireland’s obligations under the European Convention of Human Rights (\\"ECHR\\").Sivsivadze and Others v Minister for Justice and Equality, Ireland and Attorney General (No 1) [2012] IEHC 137, [2012] IEHC 244 S3(11) permits the Minister to amend or revoke a deportation order. == Holding of the Supreme Court == The Supreme Court judgment was delivered by Murray J. The appellants argued that s3(1) of the 1999 Act was unconstitutional in that, as a deportation order under it was for an indefinite period, this amounted to a disproportionate interference with the rights of the family under the Irish Constitution. The appellants also argued that s3(11) of the 1999 Act was incompatible with Article 15 of the Irish Constitution, in that it permitted an unlawful delegation of legislative powers to the Minister, in the absence of a sufficient statement of principles and policies in the legislation governing how the Minister should exercise his power to make a deportation order.Sivsivadze v Minister for Justice [2015] 2 ILRM 73; [2016] 2 IR 403; [2015] IESC 53 [3]. Alternatively, the appellant’s argued (on the same grounds) that their family rights under Article 8 of the ECHR were breached by the provisions of the 1999 Act. === The Constitutional Arguments === The Supreme Court noted that the constitutional challenge focused \\"on the potentially disproportionate impact which allegedly an indefinite and perhaps lifelong deportation order may have on the family life of a person who will, as a result of deportation, be separated from a spouse and children lawfully resident in this country\\".Sivsivadze v Minister for Justice [2015] 2 ILRM 73; [2016] 2 IR 403; [2015] IESC 53 [45]. However, the Court noted that a deportation order under s3(1) of the 1999 Act is not necessarily unlimited in time, as the Minister can, under s3(11) of the 1999 Act, amend or revoke the order. The Court held that the Minister, in exercising the discretion to make an order under s3(1) of the 1999 Act, or to amend or revoke an order under s3(11) of the 1999 Act, must do so in line with the principles of proportionality and fair procedures, and in accordance with his obligations under the Constitution and the ECHR. The effect of a deportation order made in respect of a person who has no legal right to enter or remain in the State is to put that person in the same position as all other non-nationals who must seek permission from the Minister to enter the State. Such non-nationals do not acquire rights to enter or remain in the State simply due to the passage of time, so it would be \\"incongruous\\" for a deportation order to define a period of time within which the obligation to remain outside the State would end.Sivsivadze v Minister for Justice [2015] 2 ILRM 73; [2016] 2 IR 403; [2015] IESC 53 [58]. The Supreme also rejected the argument that s3(11) of the 1999 Act amounted to an unconstitutional delegation of legislative powers to the Minister. Murray J held that the power of the State to exclude non- nationals or aliens from the entering the territory of Ireland is not a power that originates in statute, but \\"is a power inherent in a sovereign state\\"; he held that \\"what the Act of 1999 does, in effect, is to designate the Minister as being the person who makes the decision whether to make or revoke a deportation order\\".Sivsivadze v Minister for Justice [2015] 2 ILRM 73; [2016] 2 IR 403; [2015] IESC 53 [67]. Murray J cited the decision of Fennelly J, who considered s3(11) of the 1999 Act in Cirpaci (nee McCormack) & anor -v- The Minister for Justice, Equality & Law ReformCirpaci (Née McCormack) and Cirpaci v The Minister for Justice, Equality & Law Reform [2005] IESC 42, [2005] 4 IR 109.: > On its face, this provision confers a broad discretion, to be exercised in > accordance with general principles of law, interpreted in the light of the > Constitution and in accordance with fair procedures.Cirpaci (Née McCormack) > and Cirpaci v The Minister for Justice, Equality & Law Reform [2005] IESC > 42, [2005] 4 IR 109 [26]. Murray J concluded that the exercise of the power under s3(11) of the 1999 Act involves the exercise of a margin of appreciation related to the facts of individual cases, and that the discretion was clearly left by the Oireachtas to the Minister. === The ECHR Arguments === The Court applied the same logic to the ECHR arguments, noting that there was nothing in the relevant sections that would restrict the Minister, when making a decision, from \\"fully taking into account the Article 8 rights of the family directly affected by a deportation order or a refusal to revoke one, in accordance with the principles laid down in the European Convention.\\"Sivsivadze v Minister for Justice [2015] 2 ILRM 73; [2016] 2 IR 403; [2015] IESC 53 [85]. === Conclusion === The Supreme Court dismissed the appeal. ==References== == External Links == *Asylum and Immigration Law *Sivsivadze v Minister for Justice ","title":"Sivsivadze v Minister for Justice"},{"id":"60357454","text":"Liangtian () may refer to these places in China: *Liangtian Township, in Jiexi County, Guangdong *Liangtian Subdistrict, in Linwei District, Weinan, Shaanxi ==Towns== *Liangtian, Guangxi, in Luchuan County, Guangxi *Liangtian, Guizhou, in Zhenning Buyei and Miao Autonomous County, Guizhou *Liangtian, Hunan, in Chenzhou, Hunan *Liangtian, Ningxia, in Yinchuan, Ningxia ","title":"Liangtian"},{"id":"60357463","text":"The John Cox House, in Hopkins County, Kentucky near Nebo, Kentucky, was built in 1875.

As a consequence of these tragedies, Eliza Ann and her husband Captain David Ross raised Alimira's fourth son, John Jenkins Kenney (1882-1963). == Seafaring life == Eliza Ann accompanied her husband, Captain David Ross on many ocean voyages in square- riggers. They sailed around Cape Horn several times and crisscrossed the Atlantic carrying general cargo to British, Scottish and northern European ports, sailing mostly from New York and Philadelphia. She was with her husband aboard the brig Madeline Lovitt in 1899, en route to Falmouth with a load of grain, when their ship was rammed and badly damaged while lying in wait for a favorable wind. On their last voyage Captain Ross who was then fifty-three years old, accompanied by Eliza Ann was in command of the steel four-masted barquentine Reform, which had been bought by William Lovitt of Yarmouth, Nova Scotia in 1899. Reform cleared the port of Brunswick, Georgia, on February 2, 1901, bound for Buenos Aires. She had a new crew of Portuguese sailors, none of whom could speak or understand English, except Alexander Spears, the first mate. Within a fortnight the ship ran into a violent winter storm, and on the night of February the eleventh, a heavy sea broke over the barquentine and flooded the deck, sweeping Captain Ross overboard to a watery grave.Memorial 85057654 - Find A Grave - Capt David Larkin Ross This was a traumatic experience for Eliza Ann but, having learned navigation from her husband, she assumed command of the ship. Besides having to cope with her loss and the responsibility of taking complete charge of the barquentine, she had to depend on her first mate to interpret her orders to the crew. For fear that they might mutiny, she had to make sure the crew were not aware that the captain was gone. For the next fifty days Eliza Ann was the ship's master. Reform cleared Argentina and Eliza Ann successfully delivered Reform's cargo.\\"The Ship-Masters of Old Cape Sables\\" by Capt. Arthur N. McGray 6 March 1941 - Capt.

She was a four-masted barkentine built of steel at 191.7 feet long and 30.4 feet wide. Her gross tonnage was 593.24, with under deck tonnage at 540.01, poop 4.29, roundhouse 39.30, hatchway 9.64, and deductions 48.24, for a net 545 registered tonnage. The 48.24 ton deductions accounted for 16.70 tons for crew and officers. An additional 31.54 tons accounted for the master's cabin, chart room, boatswain's stores, and sail room aft.File: YMS-6-248, Yarmouth County Archives (Yarmouth, Nova Scotia, Canada) \\"ship's file card,\\" On 16 March 1896, Sachsen was wrecked on Burial Island off County Down, Ireland. She was purchased and repaired by an English shipowner. In 1898 Norske Veritas lists Sachsen's owner as J. J. Marks, Liverpool. About that time, Sachsen's name was changed to Reform. From 1899 to 1906, Reform was owned by William Leslie Lovett of Yarmouth, Nova Scotia. From 1903 to 1906, Reform's ownership was through The Reform Shipping Company, Limited. Under Yarmouth owners, she was chiefly engaged in the lumber trade with South America. On 15 November 1906, the Reform was in ballast, sailing from Rio Janeiro to Turk's Island, where she was to load a cargo of salt for Boston. At about 5 o'clock in the morning, Reform while under full sail struck a sunken reef about a mile from Barbuda and \\"went so hard and fast that it was decided impossible to take her off.\\" While Reform was a total loss, Captain Spears and the crew reached the shore safely. She was insured for $10,000 in the Boston Insurance Company. Reform is not to be confused by a similarly named ship also associated with southern Nova Scotia. Brig Reform from Barbados went ashore at Brier Island in nearby Digby County on 25 November 1837. There, she was wrecked with the crew saved. == References == Category:1849 births Category:1940 deaths Category:People from Shelburne County, Nova Scotia Category:Sea captains ","title":"Eliza Ann Ross"},{"id":"60357608","text":"Mary Stapleton-Bretherton (1809-1883) was a Papal Marchesa and landowner who lived in Ditton and Rainhill near Liverpool. She founded many Roman Catholic churches and owned The Hall, Rainhill, Lancashire, and Lackham Manor, Wiltshire. ==Biography== Mary was the only surviving child of Bartholomew Bretherton (c. 1775-1857) and Jane Atkinson (1776-1869). Bartholomew was born in Aighton, near Stonyhurst in the Ribble Valley, and Jane was born in Scattergate, Appleby, Westmorland. Her parents married in Liverpool in 1799. They had another daughter Jane, who preceded Mary and only lived a few months (1805-6). Mary was baptized in the Portico Chapel, Prescot on 27 March 1809. Her father was listed as a flour dealer at the time of his marriage, but he became involved in the coaching business with his three brothers at the turn of the century, made his fortune, became a landowner and benefactor. Mary married firstly William Gerard Esq. (1806-1844) the grandson of Sir Robert Cansfield Gerard, 9th Baronet of Bryn. William's older brother John (1804–54) was the 12th Baronet, and his younger brother Robert, (1808–87) became Sir Robert Tolver Gerard the 13th Baronet and the First Baron of Bryn. William's father John died in 1822. (John's two older brothers were the 10th and 11th Baronets respectively.) Their sister Maria Juliana Gerard married Thomas Stapleton of Carlton and had several children. The third child was Gilbert Stapleton (1808-1856), a cousin of William Gerard, and he became Mary's second husband. Mary married William in 1829, and Gilbert in 1848. Mary made her home at Ditton Hall near Widnes during her two marriages. She was childless. By the time her father died in 1857, Mary was a wealthy woman. She had been the sole beneficiary of her first husband, William Gerard; had been amply endowed with the residue of the estate of her second husband, Gilbert Stapleton; and was the inheritor of her father's lands and, on the death of her mother, occupied Rainhill Hall (later it became a Catholic retreat centre known as Loyola Hall). In 1866 she acquired her Lackham Manor estate in Wiltshire. She had the means to keep the two mansion houses and estates going, and to give away her home at Ditton Hall, Widnes to the Jesuits in exile from Germany in 1872. She also paid for St. Michael's Church, Ditton to be built. Mary owned mines, quarries, woodlots, farms and their dwellings, and had a financial portfolio of stocks and shares. She was presented to Queen Victoria in 1849 by her sister-in-law, Lady Beaumont. Mary changed her last name to Stapleton- Bretherton by Royal Licence in September 1868 and was made a Marchesa Romana by Pope Pius IX in 1873. She was henceforth known as \\"Lady Mary \\" in many quarters. She was known for her endowments to the Roman Catholic Church and had an extensive network of friends, relatives and acquaintances among the Catholic gentry. She made several additions, including the gateway and the surrounding walls, to St. Bartholomew's Church, Rainhill, the church that her father founded. Mary died of breast cancer in 1883. She would have been a multi-millionairess by today's standards. Her assets at her death were listed as £375,744.14s.6d. and her will with two codicils was 75 pages long. Her main heir was her first cousin once removed Frederick Annesley Stapleton-Bretherton (1841-1919) whose family then occupied Rainhill Hall as well as property in Hampshire. A condition of Mary's will was that Frederick adopt the name Stapleton-Bretherton. Her Lackham estate was inherited by Sir George Errington (1839-1920), MP for Longford (1874-1885). The Roman Catholic Church of St. Mary and St. Joseph in Aiskew, North Yorkshire, built in 1878 has a memorial window, dating from 1884, to Mary placed by her nephew the Hon. Miles Stapleton (1850–95), who became the 10th Lord Beaumont. == See also == * Bartholomew Bretherton * Bartholomew Bretherton (jockey) * Evelyn, Princess Blücher * Rainhill Hall * St Bartholomew's Church, Rainhill == References == Category:British landowners Category:1809 births Category:1883 deaths ","title":"Mary Stapleton-Bretherton"},{"id":"60357615","text":"The Hanson Historic District, in Hanson, Kentucky, is a historic district including 11 contributing buildings which was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1988.

Both lines operate every 20–30 minutes during peak hours and 24–30 minutes at other times on weekdays and Saturdays, and 30–40 minutes on Sundays. Trips would take roughly 60-70 minutes for both routes. On Sundays however, the C2 is shortened to operate between Takoma Langley Crossroads Transit Center and Greenbelt Station, which takes 30 minutes. Both lines connect northern Prince George's County to Montgomery County via the University Boulevard East/West (MD 193) corridor. ==Background== Routes C2 and C4 mostly provide service along University Boulevard operating between Montgomery County and Prince George's County via Takoma Park connecting riders between the two.

} ==History== ===Origination of the Line=== C2 was created as a new route on February 4, 1973, to replace the segment of the former J8 streetcar line between Wheaton Plaza & Montgomery Mall when the J8 became a Metrobus Route and was truncated to only operate between the Wheaton Plaza & Beltway Plaza. Routes C2 & J8 operated as part of the \\"Beltway Plaza–Montgomery Mall Line\\" until February 19, 1978. when they were both merged into route C2. Route C2 operated between Montgomery Mall & Beltway Plaza, via Prince George's Plaza Mall & University of Maryland, College Park. Route C6 originally operated between White Oak to Montgomery College and then between White Oak and Twinbrook until replaced by various routes. ===1984 Changes=== On December 15, 1984, route C2 was truncated to terminate at the newly opened Twinbrook station only discontinuing service to Montgomery Mall. During this same time, route C4 began revenue service to operate alongside with the C2 operating between Twinbrook and Langley Park (Lebanon Street & University Boulevard East). The line was renamed as the \\"Greenbelt-Twinbrook Line\\" as of result. ===1990 Changes=== On September 22, 1990, route C2 was truncated even further to only operate up to Wheaton station while route C4 was diverted to serve Wheaton station. Route C2 would now only operate between Wheaton station and Beltway Plaza. ===1993 Changes=== On December 11, 1993, route C2 was extended from Beltway Plaza Mall to Greenbelt Center via Greenbelt station when the Green Line northern portion was opened replacing route F6 service between University Of Maryland and Beltway Plaza which was rerouted to serve New Carrollton station along with route F4. But Route C2 will discontinue service via Prince Georges Plaza and University Of Maryland operating on a direct route along Campus Drive. Route C4 was extended from Langley Park to Prince George's Plaza station, along route C2's original routing from intersection of University Boulevard East in Langley Park & the Prince George's Plaza Mall, via Riggs Road, and East West Highway. ===2001 Changes=== On January 13, 2001, route C4 was rerouted along Toledo Terrace and Belcrest Road to serve the apartment complexes behind The Mall at Prince Georges. The line would serve the mall bus bays from Belcrest Road. ===2003 Changes=== Route C4 at Prince Georges Plaza On May 15, 2003, the original bus bays inside Prince Georges Plaza mall, were demolished in order to build a new Target store. Routes C4 along with routes 86, F4, F6, F8, R2, R3, R4 and TheBus 13, 14, 18 have stopped entering and looping inside around the mall. ===2010 Proposed changes=== In 2010, WMATA proposed to completely discontinue the C4 and to replace it with the C8 and J5. Under the proposal, the J5 would discontinue service along the Capital Beltway and Grosvenor–Strathmore station and will serve the former C4 stops via Parklawn Drive, Randolph Road, Veirs Mill Road, Wheaton Station, and Georgia Avenue. Service to Prince George's Plaza station would be provided by the C8 which was proposed to discontinue service to College Park–University of Maryland station and University of Maryland. However a major problem in the proposal was the C8 was proposed to only operate on Weekday Peak Hour services only while the J5 only operated during Peak Hours. With the discontinuation of the C4 and the changes made on the C8 and J5, it would not only lose direct service from Prince George's Plaza to Twinbrook, it would also mean residents would have a lack of bus service where the C4 operated since the C8 and J5 would only operate during rush hours only. Route C2 was proposed to be shorten to Greenbelt station discontinuing service to Greenbelt Center being replaced by a new route T12, T14, and existing T16 or routes G12, G14, and G16 eliminating service between Greenbelt station and Greenbelt Center. This was a result of Greenbelt bus service lacking much service and the city of Greenbelt wanting to restructure the lines. ===2010 Changes=== On December 19, 2010, route C2 was truncated from the Greenbelt Center to only operate up to Greenbelt station at the request of the city of Greenbelt with service between Greenbelt station and Greenbelt Center being replaced by new routes G13, G14, and G16, in order to simplify Greenbelt bus service as much as possible with other routes and as a method of circumventing the transportation budget shortfall in Prince George's County, MD. Route C2 also discontinue the Beltway Plaza Loop as well being replaced by routes G14, and G16. ===2015 Proposed Changes=== In 2015, WMATA proposed to split the C2 and C4 into two separate routes. Route C2 would operate between Greenbelt station and the upcoming Takoma Langley Crossroads Transit Center while route C4 would keep its current routing but have every other trip end at Wheaton station. Sunday service would also be added to route C2 in order to replace route 81 which is proposed to be eliminated. The changes were due to the demand for bus service is the lowest on the section of the line between Langley Park and Greenbelt station and it is easier to manage service on University Boulevard with only one route instead of having overlapping service. ===March 2016 changes=== On March 27, 2016, new Sunday Service was added to the C2 operating between Greenbelt station and Langley Park only replacing route 81 service. ===December 2016 changes=== When the Takoma Langley Crossroads Transit Center opened on December 22, 2016, the C2 and C4 were rerouted, along with several other Metrobus, Ride On buses, Shuttle UM and TheBus routes, to serve the newly opened Transit Center. Routes C2 and C4 would serve Bus Bay A. ==Incidents== * On September 30, 2010, a C4 bus rear ended a C2 bus along University Boulevard. 26 people were injured in the collision. == References == C2 Category:Transportation in Montgomery County, Maryland Category:Transportation in Prince George's County, Maryland ","title":"Greenbelt–Twinbrook Line"},{"id":"60357644","text":"Oscar Arnulfo Diaz Ramirez (born 31 December 1991 in San Francisco Gotera, Morazán) is a Salvadoran professional footballer who plays in the midfielder position for Central Texas Lobos FC.Central Texas Lobos He previously played for C.D.

From 1646 to 1647, he worked on decorating the \\"Cabinet de l'Amour\\" at the Hôtel Lambert, along with the landscape painters Pierre Patel, Jan Asselyn and Herman van Swanevelt. In 1648, he became a member of the Académie royale de peinture et de sculpture and was named a Professor in 1655, which was an unusual honor for a landscape painter. Together with Laurent de La Hyre, he helped to popularize the classical landscape style of Claude Lorrain. Having become famous for his decorations, he undertook to paint the apartments of Queen Anne of Austria at Fontainebleau. As with the Hôtel Lambert, the greater part of those works have disappeared. His wife died in 1671. By 1686, he was too ill to attend sessions of the Académie, and was excused.

TuiSamoa spent a lifetime supporting and campaigning for the rights of her fellow Pacific Islanders in Auckland, both new migrants and their New Zealand-born children. She was a leading figure in many community organisations and campaigns, at a time when very few Pacific people were active in the fields of social work or political advocacy. Her work was marked by innovation and a willingness to take a contrary path to others in her community. Her initiatives also supported struggling Auckland families from a variety of other backgrounds. == Early life == Of Samoan and Chinese descent, Agnes Rosa Sue was born on 7 December 1932 in Suva, Fiji, the daughter of Apaula Theresa Perera and her husband, Harry Sue. Her parents separated when she was young and both remarried. She was brought up by her godmother and foster father until the age of 10, when she returned to live with her mother. Her childhood contained many aspects of difference: growing up Samoan in Fiji, with significant links to her Chinese heritage; being Catholic in a largely Protestant country; and being better- dressed than many of her schoolmates. These things made her aware that there were many less fortunate than herself. After a Catholic education, she attended a business college and worked for the Catholic bishop as a teenager. In 1951 she moved for a time to Western Samoa, where she consolidated her Samoan language skills. Her facility with languages – she also spoke English, Fijian and some Hindi – would be very important in later years. She soon became known as someone who could help others, a reputation which followed her to New Zealand. == Living in New Zealand == Sue emigrated to New Zealand in 1953 as a young single woman who wanted to become a nurse. She was given a training position at the private Catholic Mater Misericordiae Hospital in Auckland, but faced racism and did not receive the training she had been promised. She resigned and found work in the accounts department at Auckland Hospital’s laundry, which employed many Pacific Islanders. Since the Second World War, the Pacific Island community in Auckland has grown rapidly, its members having travelled to New Zealand looking for increased opportunities for education and employment. In 1954, Sue had her first child; she was engaged to the boy’s father, but he returned to Western Samoa and she did not wish to follow him. There was minimal social support for unmarried mothers at that time, so others cared for her son on weekdays while she worked. After six months, Sue’s mother took the baby to Fiji. Sue married Keresipi Tuisamoa in Auckland on 21 October 1955. Born in Western Samoa, Keresipi was a car painter and later a labourer who had emigrated to New Zealand in the early 1950s. Agnes Tuisamoa's second child was born in 1956, and eight more followed over the next 16 years. Her eldest son returned to the family in the early 1960s. The family spelled their surname ‘TuiSamoa’ after Keresipi received a Samoan title in 1998. == Social and community work == Although Tuisamoa married into the Presbyterian church, her Catholic upbringing remained an important influence throughout her life. She joined the congregation of the Pacific Island Presbyterian Church in Newton, the first Pacific Island church in New Zealand. This church provided social support services to its congregation, and, unlike many other churches at that time, had Pacific Islanders in roles of responsibility. It was also one of the few organisations of the era to work across the quite disparate Pacific migrant communities. Agnes worked voluntarily with the clergy to support those newly-arrived from the islands who were struggling to adjust to life in a big city away from their social and kin networks. Unlike many in her community, Tuisamoa felt that attending services on Sunday should be a matter of choice. She viewed her social work and counselling as her contribution to church life. Families increasingly came to Tuisamoa for help – her language skills and ability as an advocate created an expectation that she would help people in trouble. She worked as a part- time nurse aide in the mid-1960s, but in 1975 she moved into professional community and social work. That year she joined the Auckland Methodist Central Mission; she remained a lynchpin of its Pacific Centre, a unique inner-city social-service agency run by and for Pacific Islanders, for nearly 30 years. Her work involved assisting families with immigration and legal issues, finance and budgeting, domestic violence, and drug and alcohol problems. She worked with all age groups and ethnicities, often taking on difficult cases, sometimes for years, until they found their feet. She worked with patience and skill, lobbying social welfare officials on behalf of struggling families and working with lawyers on immigration issues. Social work fa'asamoa (in the Samoan way) placed particular demands on Tuisamoa and her family. People would come to her home to seek help, or she would visit theirs, in the middle of the night if necessary. Her young family was also involved, helping provide food to struggling people who came to their door. Tuisamoa received a Certificate for Community Studies from the University of Auckland in 1977. She was later involved in the Pacific Advisory Committee for the new School of Social Work at the Auckland College of Education, working to ensure it met the needs of Pacific Island students. Through her work, Tuisamoa became involved in networks of like-minded people in Auckland who were trying to help those in need. She worked particularly closely with urban Pacific Island and Māori groups, and political pressure groups campaigning for the rights of the downtrodden. Tuisamoa was one of the few of the older, more cautious, generation of Pacific Island leaders to support the Polynesian Panther movement, a youth-led organisation concerned with the treatment of Pacific Islanders in New Zealand during the 1970s era of ‘dawn raids’ and the deportation of ‘overstayers’. She was regarded as a ‘stirrer’ and likened by some to the Māori women activists of her day, such as Whina Cooper and Eva Rickard. In the early 1970s she also worked with anti-racism groups that were exploring the implications of the Treaty of Waitangi. She participated in direct action, particularly supporting tenants at risk of eviction and occupying homes while legal issues were resolved. She was also involved in a successful legal challenge to New Zealand's immigration policies in 1982, which reclassified many Western Samoans as New Zealand citizens. == Social organisations == As well as assisting families directly, Tuisamoa helped pioneer and support many social organisations, as the needs of Auckland's Pacific Island community changed over the decades. Much of this work was focused on Auckland's inner suburbs such as Grey Lynn, Ponsonby and Herne Bay, where the Tuisamoa family and most of the city's Pacific Islanders lived at the time. In 1978 she helped establish the Grey Lynn Neighbourhood Law Office, which provided free legal advice. This was the first community law centre in the country; such centres soon became an important part of New Zealand's legal culture. Recognising that there was a lack of culturally-appropriate services for vulnerable members of Pacific Island and Māori communities, Tuisamoa helped set up or support three women’s refuges, an organisation to assist alcoholics, the Grey Lynn Community Housing Society, a residential housing programme for homeless young people, and Pillars, an organisation supporting children whose parents were in prison. Tuisamoa believed that the education system was letting down Pacific Island children by undermining their culture. She considered language central to defining a person's identity, so was concerned for the New Zealand-born generations of Pacific Islanders living without their language: ‘They will think of themselves as Kiwi, but will Kiwis accept them? I don't think so. They will be in limbo. In the 1980s she helped establish the first full-immersion Pacific Island language early childhood centre in Auckland, A’oga Fa’a Samoa, a model since replicated around the country. Disappointed that her own children had not grown up bilingual, she took much pleasure in interacting with her Samoan-speaking grandchildren. She was also involved with the governance of her children's schools, and took part in initiatives to promote non-formal and community education initiatives for adults. Tuisamoa sat on many committees which advised local and central government. She was a member of the Samoan Council of Women and the Pacific Island Advisory Council, established to create lines of communication between her community, the Minister of Pacific Island Affairs and government. She also worked in the Labour Party’s Auckland Central electorate office. She represented New Zealand at the 1975 Pacific Women’s Conference in Suva, the first time women in the region came together to assess the position of women in their societies. From this grew a new women’s organisation, PACIFICA, which aimed to empower Pacific women living in New Zealand. In 1988 she was one of the first trustees appointed to the ASB Community Trust, an organisation which provided grants to groups in Auckland and Northland. She held this position until 1994. == Later life and legacy == Tuisamoa stood out for taking on non- traditional roles, particularly as a woman in Auckland’s largely conservative Samoan community. She was the first Pacific Island woman in many community organisations. She believed strongly in the equality of men and women, and stood up to those who sought to play down social issues within their community. Likewise, she took a contrary view to many in her generation with regard to the cultural obligations on families to donate money to the church and extended family members in the islands. Her belief that her children should have freedom sometimes brought her into conflict with her more traditional husband. Made a Justice of the Peace in 1985, Tuisamoa enjoyed the opportunity this role gave her to meet a range of people. She did not wish to receive public recognition for her work, but was awarded a Queen's Service Medal for community service in the 1985 Queen's Birthday Honours. She retired from social work in the early 2000s, at a time when professional social work was changing radically. Although she was dedicated to Samoan culture, Tuisamoa lived in New Zealand for 51 years. Interviewed in 1988, she said that she defined herself as a New Zealander and regarded New Zealand as her home. She also denied that she was a ‘leader’ of her community, or even a ‘helper’: ‘I don’t claim to lead people, I want to walk along with them, I don’t want to get in front’. Agnes TuiSamoa died in Auckland on 17 November 2004, aged 71, and was survived by her husband and children. == References == Category:1932 births Category:2004 deaths Category:New Zealand community activists Category:New Zealand people of Samoan descent Category:New Zealand social workers Category:People from Suva Category:Recipients of the Queen's Service Medal Category:New Zealand justices of the peace ","title":"Agnes TuiSamoa"},{"id":"60357734","text":"Kaira Sturdivant Rouda (born May 17, 1963) is an American author and businesswoman.

Wuhanic acid was identified, along with nebraskanic acid, as a major fatty acid of the seed oil of Chinese violet cress (Orychophragmus violaceus L. O.E.Schulz).. Wuhanic acid was named in honor of the location of its co-discoverer Chunyu Zhang, a professor in the National Key Lab of Crop Genetic Improvement and College of Plant Science and Technology at Huazhong Agricultural University in Wuhan, Hubei, China. Chinese violet cress flowers and seeds, the source of wuhanic acid rich-oil. == Biosynthesis == Wuhanic acid is believed to arise in part from a \\"discontinuous elongation\\" pathway as described for nebraskanic acid biosynthesis. In the proposed biosynthetic pathway, oleic acid bound to phosphatidylcholine is converted to ricinoleic acid by a 12-hydroxylase, a functional variant of the FAD2 Δ12 oleic acid desaturase. Ricinoleic is subsequently released to the acyl-CoA pool where it is elongated to a C20 intermediate. At the second step of fatty acid elongation, the C20 3-OH intermediate is elongated to a C22 5-OH fatty acyl- CoA by a variant FAE1 β-ketoacyl-CoA synthetase. This elongation of the 3-OH intermediate prior to the completion of a full fatty acid elongation cycle was termed discontinuous elongation. This fatty acid undergoes a subsequent complete elongation cycle to form the C24 7,18 dihydroxy fatty acid nebraskanic acid. The omega-3 double bond is believed to be introduced during wuhanic acid biosynthesis by a FAD3 ω-3 fatty acid desaturase. == Functionality == Chinese violet cress oil contains 35% to 50% of the C24 dihydroxy fatty acids wuhanic and nebraskanic acids. This oil was shown to have superior lubricity at 100 °C in metal-on-metal lubrication studies compared to ricinoleic acid-rich castor oil. In these studies, Chinese violet cress oil had ~4-fold lower coefficient of friction relative to castor oil. The unique functionality of Chinese violet cress oil was speculated to result from fatty acids binding to the hydroxyl groups of wuhanic and nebraskanic acids in triacylglycerols to form complex estolides. ==References== Category:Fatty acids Category:Diols ","title":"Wuhanic acid"},{"id":"60357988","text":"Jinfeng () is a town under the administration of Zhangjiagang, Jiangsu, China. , it has 11 residential communities and 24 villages under its administration. == References == Category:Township-level divisions of Jiangsu Category:Zhangjiagang ","title":"Jinfeng, Jiangsu"},{"id":"60358003","text":"Lost in the Feeling may refer to: *\\"Lost in the Feeling\\" (song), a 1983 song by Conway Twitty *Lost in the Feeling (Conway Twitty album), 1983 *Lost in the Feeling (Mark Chesnutt album), 2000 ","title":"Lost in the Feeling"},{"id":"60358026","text":"Valter Mutt (born 1955) is a Swedish politician.

Carroll, Xiaohong Chen and Yingyao Hu propose an approach to identify and estimate a general nonlinear errors-in-variable (EIV) model without validation data, measurement error distribution, and instrumental variables. They utilize two samples which are supposed to contain three parts for each sample, including a dependent variable (Y), certain error-free covariates (W), and one measurement of the error-ridden covariate (X). The corresponding true variable is not measured precisely in two samples and the latent true values might be randomly associated with the unknown measure error distribution. Without knowing the measurement error distribution that might be associated with latent true values and the precise corresponding true variable, the authors suppose the latent true covariate and the error-free covariates in the dependent variable are the same. However, the latent true variables distributed differently across observed and specific error-free variables. In addition, they also propose a sieve quasi-MLE method to estimate parameter in the parametric regression model and \\"establish its root-n consistency and asymptotic normality under possible misspecification, and its semiparametric efficiency under correct specification, with easily estimated standard errors\\". *\\"Land of Addicts? An Empirical Investigation of Habit-Based Asset Pricing Models\\" (2009): The winner of The Richard Stone Prize in Applied Econometrics The scarceness of habit function leads to the difficulty in formal estimation. Xiaohong Chen and Sydney C. Ludvigson study a general class of habit-based asset pricing model by using the semiparametric approach in this article. Without putting constraints on the habit function, they estimate both finite dimensional parameters and the habit specification. They have three main findings in their paper, as following: \\"the estimated habit function is nonlinear\\", \\"habit formation is better described as internal rather than external, and the estimated time-preference parameter and the power utility parameter are sensible\\". Comparing with the SMD-estimated external habit model, the three-factor asset pricing model, the scaled consumption CAMP model, the classic CAPM, and the classic consumption CAPM, the SMD-estimated internal habit model have more advantages in explaining \\"a cross-section of size and book-market sorted portfolio equity returns\\". Their study tries to overcome the limitation on formal estimation and testing. One significant limitation is the lack of the functional form of the habit. Another limitation is the lack of \\"theoretical reason why other forms of nonlinearities could not be entertained\\".The habit-based asset pricing model is assessed, and they tried to put fewer constraints on the habit specification and the motion law for consumption is not put any parametric constraints on. They exam the unknown habit function and compare the internal habit and external habit formation by Sieve Minimum Distance (SMD) procedure. By using this method, they test their hypotheses about the habit-based asset pricing models' specification. For the first hypothesis, they test the linearity and find that nonlinear is more appropriate to depict the habit function. Conditional moment constraint is used to compare the internal habit and external habit specification. For the second hypothesis, they conclude that the internal habit formation is more proper to describe habit formation. For the third hypothesis, they estimate the \\"quantitative importance of the habit in the power utility specification\\" by utilizing the SMD method and they find that time-discount factor and power utility curvature parameter are sensible toward different instruments and returns. *\\"Estimation of Copula- based Semiparametric Time Series Models\\" (2006): The winner of the 2008 Arnold Zellner Award In the article, the unknown marginal distribution estimators and the copula dependence parameter estimators are given in Xiaohong Chen and Yanqin Fan's studies of copula-based semiparametric stationary Markov time series models that contains nonparametric marginal distributions and parameterized copulas. Chen and Fan also estimate the characteristics of transitional distribution of the time series by using the two estimators they proposed and create the consistency and root n asymptotic normality of the two estimators. *\\"Causality, Prediction, and Specification Analysis: Recent Advances and Future Directions\\" (2014) This paper is written by Xiaohong Chen and Norman R.

It is a transition metal complex consisting of an iron atom in the +3 oxidation state and three bidentate oxalate ions anions acting as ligands. The ferrioxalate anion gives a lime green color to salts, and in solution it is fluorescent. The anion is sensitive to light and higher-energy electromagnetic radiation, which causes the decomposition of one oxalate to carbon dioxide and reduction of the iron(III) atom to iron(II). This property is exploited for actinometry. The most common and most-studied salt is potassium ferrioxalate, but the sodium, ammonium, and lithium salts have also received some attention. ==Properties== ===Stability=== In the absence of light or other radiation, the ferrioxalate complex is quite stable. The potassium and sodium salts and their solutions can be heated to near 100 °C for hours without significant decomposition. ===Molecular structure=== The complex is held together by dative covalent bonds, due to the oxygen atoms in the oxalate anions (the \\"ligands\\") donating a lone pair to the p and d orbitals of the iron atom (the \\"center\\" of the complex). The center has three electrons in its d orbitals, leaving 13 empty places in the remaining d and p orbitals. Twelve of these are filled by electrons from the ligands. The iron center in the ferrioxalate anion has a distorted octahedral geometry The ferrioxalate complex has D3 molecular symmetry, within which . The six Fe–O bond distances all close to 2.0 Å which indicates that the Fe(III) is high spin; as the low spin complex would display Jahn–Teller distortions. The ammonium and mixed sodium-potassium salts are isomorphous, as are related complexes with Al3+, Cr3+, and V3+. ===Chirality=== The ferrioxalate complex displays helical chirality as it can form two non-superimposable geometries. In accordance with the IUPAC convention, the isomer with the left-handed screw axis is assigned the Greek symbol Λ (lambda). Its mirror image with the right-handed screw axis is given the Greek symbol Δ (delta). center ==Reactions== ===Photoreduction=== In solution, the ferrioxalate complex undergoes photoreduction. In this process, the complex absorbs a photon of light and subsequently decomposes to form and . The iron centre is reduced (gains an electron) from the +3 to the +2 oxidation state, while an oxalate ion is oxidised to carbon dioxide: : 2 []3− \\\\+ hν → 2 []2− \\\\+ 2 + This reaction provides an efficient chemical method for photometry and actinometry, the measurement of light and higher-energy electromagnetic radiation. Potassium ferrioxalate is over 1000 times more sensitive than uranyl oxalate, the compound previously used for these purposes. While the complex itself is insensitive to neutrons, the lithium salt can be used to measure them. A lithium-6 nucleus can absorb a neutron and emit alpha particle and a triton with high energies, which presumably decompose the nearby ferrioxalate.Junko Akashi, Yoshio Uchida, Tomoko Kojima, Motomi Katada, and Hirotoshi Sano (1984): \\"Mössbauer Spectroscopic Studies of the Effects of the 6Li(n, α)T Reaction in Lithium Tris(oxalato)ferrate(III)\\".

It is the first Quebec law stating that \\"The State of Québec is a lay State (section 1).\\" Since it was passed, new hires among public workers in positions of coercive authority have been banned from wearing religious symbols. It also mandates having one's face uncovered to give or receive specific public services. == Laicity of the state == The first section of the Act Respecting Laicity of the State asserts that Quebec is a \\"lay State\\". The laicity of the state is based on four principles * the equality of all citizens (); and * freedom of conscience and freedom of religion. According to the second paragraph of section 4, \\"State laicity also requires that all persons have the right to lay parliamentary, government and judicial institutions, and to lay public services\\". ==Background== ===Prior legislation=== The Quebec ban on face covering (included in Bill 62, “An act to foster adherence to State religious neutrality and, in particular, to provide a framework for requests for accommodations on religious grounds in certain bodies”) made world headlines in October 2017. The bill was passed on October 18, 2017. The ban prevented a person whose face is covered from delivering or receiving a public service. Justice Minister Stéphanie Vallée stated that people could seek religious exemption on a \\"case by case\\" basis. According to an article in The Economist, the law's \\"real purpose is to ban Muslim women from wearing niqabs, or face veils, when they provide or receive public services\\". Some others feel that the aim of the law is to counter growing use of religious symbolism by Muslim women in Quebec. The ban has worried some conservative Muslims who consider face covering a necessary part of their religion and have defined the move as islamophobia. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau spoke out against it. Several scholars have also criticised the ban. The ban was challenged by the Canadian Civil Liberties Association and the National Council of Canadian Muslims in the Quebec Superior Court. Meanwhile, the Parti Québécois and the Coalition Avenir Québec argued the ban was not extensive enough. Some journalists accused Quebec's then-premier Philippe Couillard of supporting the ban for “perceived political advantage”. while a majority of the general public expressed their support for this move.http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/bill-62-support-in- quebec-1.4366032 With regards to public opinion, an October 27 Ipsos poll found that 76% of Quebecers backed Bill 62, with 24% opposing it. The same survey found the 68% of Canadians in general supported a law similar to Bill 62 in their part of Canada. An October 27 Angus Reid Institute poll found that 70% Canadians outside of Quebec supported \\"legislation similar to Bill 62\\" where they lived in the country, with 30% opposing it. However, a judge made the decision that the face-covering ban cannot be applicable while analysis by another court, because of irreversible injury it may cause some women of the Muslim faith. Twice since December 2017 a Quebec judge granted an injunction on that section questioned in court by the National Council of Canadian Muslims with the participation of the Canadian Civil Liberties Association. In the judgment of the court, said section contravenes the freedoms guaranteed by the Quebec and the Canadian charters of human rights and freedoms.https://nationalpost.com/news/politics/quebec-judge-once-again- suspends-application-of-provinces-face-covering-law The Quebec Liberal Party government confirmed that it would not appeal that suspension of the key article of its Religious Neutrality Act. The government of Quebec preferred to wait for a judgement on the substance and constitutionality of the law.http://journalmetro.com/actualites/montreal/1678693/port-de-signes- religieux-des-partis-pourraient-recourir-a-la-clause-derogatoire/ If the Quebec Liberal Party government had been re-elected in the general election on October 1, 2018, Premier Philippe Couillard said he would be ready to go to the Supreme Court of Canada, if necessary, to defend Bill 62.https://quebec.huffingtonpost.ca/2018/09/10/philippe-couillard-neutralite- religieuse-etat_a_23523125/ From his previous comments on the matter, Couillard was not likely to preserve the face covering ban by invoking the notwithstanding clause of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.https://www.thestar.com/opinion/star-columnists/2018/09/12/will- quebec-be-the-next-province-to-use-the-notwithstanding-clause.html Couillard stated that his government, in passing Bill 62, did not use the notwithstanding clause by design, saying that the Supreme Court would probably uphold his government’s limited ban as reasonable and justified.https://ipolitics.ca/2018/09/12/doug-fords-use-of-notwithstanding- clause-music-to-the-ears-of-quebecs-francois-legault/ ===CAQ proposal=== As promised during the 2018 election campaign, the CAQ government tabled Bill 21 on March 28, 2019, entitled \\"An Act respecting the laicity of the State\\". The bill, since made law, bans public workers in positions of \\"authority\\" from wearing religious symbols, specifically while they are on duty. According to the text of the bill, the laicity of the state is defined by a neutral religious stance, keeping state and religious affairs apart, as well as promoting equality and freedom of conscience and religion among citizens. Immigration Minister Simon Jolin-Barrette said all religious symbols, regardless of the size of the object, would be prohibited, but not religious tattoos or hairstyles such as Rastafarian dreadlocks. The law affects: * Any public employee who carries a weapon, including police officers, courthouse constables, bodyguards, prison guards, and wildlife officers * Crown prosecutors, government lawyers, and judges * School principals, vice- principals and teachers A grandfather clause exempts some public workers as long as they continue to hold the same job, at the same institution. The law also details rules that require people to uncover their faces to receive a public service for identification or security purposes, such as taking public transit with a reduced-fare photo ID card. However, people who have their faces covered for medical reasons or to do their jobs are exempt from these rules. The previous Liberal government passed a similar law banning veils that cover the face, but the relevant sections remain suspended following a court challenge by civil liberties groups. Before that legislation, the Parti Québécois proposed a law banning the display of \\"ostentatious\\" religious symbols, but they were unable to pass it before losing an election some months thereafter. Under the CAQ's legislation, the law applies when receiving government services, including: * Municipal services such as public transit * Doctors, dentists, and midwives in public institutions * Subsidized daycares * School boards The law invokes the Notwithstanding clause to avoid legal challenge based on the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, and amends the Quebec Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms to say that \\"state laicity\\" is of \\"fundamental importance\\" to avoid lawsuits under Quebec law. ==Passage== Bill 21 at third reading had a closure motion to cut off debate at the committee stage passed by the majority CAQ members of the assembly. Debate and vote were scheduled for June 16, 2019, and passed as expected. The Bill passed on June 16 with CAQ government forcing passage of the law by a 73–35 vote, with backing of the Parti Québécois. The Quebec Liberal Party and Québec solidaire were opposed. The CAQ government also introduced last-minute amendments toughening the law, making provisions for a minister to verify that it is being obeyed and to demand corrective measures if necessary. ==Reactions== The Quebec Liberal Party said the law would go too far, particularly in respect to Muslim women, and continued to advocate a ban only on religious clothing which covered the face, such as the niqab. Québec solidaire said that it was opposed to any ban on the wearing of religious symbols. Quebec Liberal Leadership candidate, Dominique Anglade, argued that “We are all in favour of secularism, but not the way it was done with Bill 21.” The Parti Québécois said the ban did not go far enough, and that it should have been extended to public daycare workers, as in its proposed legislation. Gérard Bouchard and Charles Taylor, authors of the Bouchard-Taylor report on reasonable accommodations raised concerns that doesn’t make the province look like a “decent society” and will only feed an intolerance toward minorities. Various forms of resistance to Bill 21 have emerged since its inception. The National Council of Canadian Muslims (NCCM) and the Canadian Civil Liberties Association (CCLA) filed a legal challenge against the law which aims to stay its application. The groups argue that the law is unconstitutional, irreparably harms religious minorities and constitutes \\"state-sanctioned second class citizenship.\\" The Quebec Court of Appeal later granted the petitioning organizations leave to appeal the claim for an injunction. The Coalition Inclusion Quebec is taking legal action on the basis that Bill 21 specifically targets Muslim women. The Coalition Inclusion Quebec is challenging the use of the notwithstanding clause because it cannot be used against Section 28 of the Charter, regarding gender discrimination. Another court case is being filed by the English Montreal School Board on the basis of violating minority language rights. Calgary city council voted unanimously to condemn Bill 21 with the Mayor of Calgary, Naheed Nenshi, urging other municipal governments to speak out against Bill 21. Bill 21 was debated in the 2019 federal election debates. Bloc Quebecois leader Yves-Francois Blanchet stated this was a provincial matter and not relevant to the federal election but did campaign in favour of Bill 21. When explaining why being called a nationalist to Canada Press is not seen a pejorative; Joseph Yvon Thériault, a sociology professor at University of Quebec at Montreal, compared Bill 21 to stricter legislation to European countries such as France and Belgium as an argument that Quebec Nationalism is based on moderation. The law has faced many legal challenges. There are currently four of them. Among those four, three of them will be heard on the same date. ==See also== * Quebec Charter of Values * Quebec ban on face covering * French ban on face covering * Hijab by country#Canada * Islam in Canada ==External links== * * * ==References== Category:2019 in Quebec Category:Clothing in politics Category:Clothing controversies Category:Political controversies in Canada Category:Politics of Quebec Category:Quebec provincial legislation Category:Religious controversies Category:Political history of Quebec ","title":"Quebec ban on religious symbols"},{"id":"60358537","text":"Barry William Higman (born 30 September 1943) is a retired Australian historian of Caribbean studies who primarily taught at the University of the West Indies from 1971 to 1996.

The society operated from 1848 to 1925 and until 1901 was located in Pitt Street South. ==History== The refuge was established on 21 August 1848 by Sydney- siders concerned at the level of extra-marital pregnancies and prostitution. The Refuge Committee made it clear they felt Sydney was no worse than other cities but that it did have unique problems of its own.Sydney Female Refuge Society. (1864, March 8). Empire (Sydney, NSW: 1850–1875), p. 5. Retrieved February 5, 2019. The first of these was the legacy of young women sent out as convicts and separated from the guidance and support of their parents and families, leaving them susceptible to attack by unscrupulous men. A second problem was caused by the lack of water and sanitation in the city which encouraged disease and poor health. The society had its origins with a member of the Sydney Mechanic’s Institute, Philip Clapman, who in June 1848 arranged a private meeting with New South Wales State Ministers.Annual Report of the Sydney Female Refuge Society, Kemp and Fairfax, George Street, Sydney, 1849, p. 7. A provisional committee was set up supported by Edward Deas Thomson, Colonial Secretary, and Sir Alfred Stephen, the Chief Justice. Among their first decisions was the stipulation the new institution should be non- denominational and should abide by a clear set of rules. The running of the Institution was conducted by the Ladies’ Committee and the Gentlemen’s Committee but the internal management of the Institute was the sole responsibility of the Ladies.Twenty-Third Annual Report of the Sydney Female Refuge Society, 1871, Joseph Cook & Co., 370 George Street, Sydney, 1872, p. 11. The refuge was first housed in the ‘Old House of Correction’ next to the Carter’s Barracks in Pitt Street.Annual Report of the Sydney Female Refuge Society, 1848, Kemp and Fairfax, George Street, Sydney, 1849, p. 14. This building originally housed the treadmill (known locally as the ‘Climbing Sorrow’) where juvenile offenders, and some of maturer years, were corrected.\\"Old Sydney.\\" Truth (Sydney, NSW: 1894–1954) 21 December 1913: 12. Web. 7 February 2019. Modifications were made to the buildings by Mr Thomas Cowlshaw, a builder who lived in Hutchinson Street, Surrey Hills. One of the first orders of business was the removal of the treadmill which was noted to have no place in the upcoming regime of female reform. Entry to the refuge was either voluntary or made upon the recommendation of a magistrate, keeper of the gaol or a minister of religion. Once inside the inmates were expected to abide by the rules laid out and to stay for 1-2 years during which time they worked in the laundry or as seamstresses to earn money for the upkeep of the refuge. The rules also stipulated that they were not allowed to receive visits from anyone except those that have a legal right to see them, and these only on Tuesdays and Fridays, in the presence of the ‘Visiting Ladies’.Fourth Annual Report of the Sydney Female Refuge Society, Daniel Lovett Welch, Atlas Office, 485 George Street, Sydney, 1853, p. 10. These rules were at times hard to enforce as it was difficult to confirm exactly who the relatives were. On Tuesday 15 December 1864, Emily Brown was visited by “her brother” I told him he could not see her again without a letter from his father as matron has heard he was not her brother.A 7019 Volume 2, Daily journal book, 30 September 1864-22 October 1870, State Library of New South Wales Although the institution claimed to only accept voluntary admissions it seems that in some cases parents placed their children there - with varying results. In December 1858 the society reported how, Two young girls, aged respectively, fifteen and sixteen years, who were for some months inmates of the refuge, have since repeatedly called, and in the most feeling manner gratefully acknowledged their obligations to your committee, for the reception and treatment; their parents have also expressed their thankfulness for the beneficial change effected in their daughters.Tenth Annual Report of the Sydney Female Refuge Society, 1858, Stokes and Co, 205 George Street North, Sydney, 1859, p. 5-6.

This suggests a high success rate but the number of escapes listed in the minute books suggests a much more complex environment. It also remains unclear whether the return of thirty-one inmates to their “friends” would mark a successful outcome in practice for these women. In 1860 Inspector Harrison stated that nearly a third of the prostitutes working in Sydney were under the age of sixteen and had been born in Australia.Sydney Female Refuge Society. (1860, May 31).

Nearby is the Oregon Trail Recreation Area, another part of the NRHP segment managed by Boise Parks and Recreation. Although the Oregon Trail followed the segment identified in the NRHP listing, it then continued along the route of what is now Boise Avenue. The Capitol Boulevard Memorial Bridge, also known as the Oregon Trail Memorial Bridge, is located where the Oregon Trail crossed the Boise River by ferry and proceeded through Boise City west toward Caldwell. A series of 21 obelisks now mark the route of the Oregon Trail through Boise. ==Oregon Trail in Idaho== In the 1830s explorers Nathaniel Wyeth and Benjamin Bonneville traversed the South Pass through the Rocky Mountains into the Oregon Country. Wyeth established Fort Hall in 1834 at what is now southeastern Idaho. Also in 1834, Thomas McKay established Fort Boise in the southwest of Idaho. By the 1840s, the route between the two forts had become a well traveled part of the Oregon Trail. Although he may not have visited the region, geographer Samuel Augustus Mitchell wrote of the landscape, \\"The region lying between the Rocky and Blue mountains is rocky, barren and broken; stupendous mountain spurs traverse it in all directions, affording little level ground, and on its elevated portions snow lies nearly all the year. It rarely rains here, and no dew falls.\\" Fort Boise was abandoned in 1854, but a new Fort Boise was established in 1863 at a location farther east. Boise City was platted adjacent to the new fort in 1863. In 1906 Ezra Meeker placed the first marker in Boise to commemorate the Oregon Trail. The marker is visible at the southeast corner of the Idaho State Capitol grounds. ==See also== * Route of the Oregon Trail ==References* Category:National Register of Historic Places in Ada County, Idaho Category:Oregon Trail ","title":"Oregon Trail (Ada County, Idaho segment)"},{"id":"60358825","text":"The BAW Luba (陆霸) is a mid-size sports utility vehicle (SUV) produced by the Chinese manufacturer BAW from 2005 to 2017. ==Overview== The BAW Luba debuted in 2005 and is essentially an unlicensed copy of the Toyota Landcruiser 90-series or the Land Cruiser Prado produced from 1996 to 2002.
