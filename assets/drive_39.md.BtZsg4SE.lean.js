She made her professional debut in 1921, was a founder member of the BBC Symphony Orchestra and went on to play for more than half a century until her retirement in 1981. == The Goossens family == She was born in Liscard, Wallasey, Cheshire, a member of the famous Goossens family that had emigrated to Britain from Belgium in the 19th century. Her father and grandfather were both conductors, both called Eugène. Her brother Sir Eugene Goossens made an international conducting career in the mid-20th century and was also a composer. He spent many years working in Australia as the director of the NSW Conservatorium of Music and chief conductor of the Sydney Symphony. Her brother Léon was an eminent oboist and her sister Marie was also a distinguished harpist.Obituary in the Times, 15 December 2004 In 1916, her brother Adolphe, a gifted French horn player was killed in action.CWGC == Early career == As a child, she wanted to become an actress but was encouraged by her father to play the harp.Obituary on the BBC website, 15 December 2004 Taught by Miriam Timothy, she was already playing in public by the age of 16. When she joined the London Symphony Orchestra in 1921, taking part in their first ever tour, she was the only female performer. In 1923 she became the first harpist to be broadcast on the radio, and followed this up in 1936 by becoming the first to be broadcast on television (with the BBC Television Orchestra, conducted by her then husband Hyam Greenbaum).BBC Television Opening Night: November, 1936 == BBC Symphony Orchestra == She was a founder member of the BBC Symphony Orchestra with whom she played for fifty years (1930–1980). The founder of the orchestra, Adrian Boult, engaged her as Principal Harp before the orchestra's first public concert in October 1939. She also played under guest conductors such as Arturo Toscanini, Bruno Walter and Arnold Schoenberg. She officially retired from the orchestra in 1980, the year it was celebrating its golden jubilee. At age 91 in 1991, she became the oldest person to perform at the Last Night of the Proms concert. == Personal and family life == She married her first husband, the conductor, violinist and composer Hyam Greenbaum, in 1924. Always a heavy drinker, he died of an alcohol-related problem after their only son died at birth. With her second husband, Norman Millar, she raised pigs and poultry at the 400-year-old family home near Dorking in Surrey, where she continued to live after his death. She was a close personal friend of Sir Adrian Boult and Pierre Boulez,Robert Ponsonby: Musical Heroes, A Personal View of Music and the Musical World over Sixty Years (London: Giles de la Mare Publishers Ltd, 2009) 93-96, who wrote of her: 'Always her presence was reassuring, her professional conscience irreproachable, her attitude faultless. She loved her metier, her instrument. All this, really, was the reflection of her personality for which I have had from the first instant, not only the greatest admiration, but also an immense affection.' == Final years == She was honoured with a MBE in 1974, and later an OBE in 1980. She was recommended for a Damehood, but this was allegedly vetoed by Margaret Thatcher, who said: 'We can't give a DBE to an orchestral musician'. She retired officially from the BBC Symphony Orchestra in 1980, the year of the orchestra's Golden Jubilee. Her final performance was in 1991 during the Last Night of the Proms when she accompanied Dame Gwyneth Jones in her own arrangement of \\"The Last Rose of Summer\\". There were celebratory concerts for her 100th birthday at London's Wigmore and Royal Festival Halls. She died in Reigate, Surrey, on 15 December 2004 aged 105. == References == ==External links== * telegraph.co.uk * GOOSSENS, Sidonie International Who's Who. accessed 8 September 2006.

The population was 6,974 at the 2010 census. Much of the village center is listed on the National Register of Historic Places as Kingston Village Historic District. It was originally known as Little Rest. ==History== Kingston was first settled in the late seventeenth century. For a time, starting in the late 1770s, the preacher Jemima Wilkinson, known as the Public Universal Friend resided and gave sermons in the town. As late as the 1900s inhabitants of Kingston called a species of solidago \\"Jemima weed\\", because its appearance in the town coincided with the preacher's first visit to the area.Christian M McBurney, Kingston : a forgotten history (1975), p. 32Philip Kittredge Taylor, \\"Little Rest\\", in The New England Magazine, vol. 28, no. 2 (April, 1903), p. 139 (a record from when the term \\"Jemima weed\\" was still in use). Originally known as Little Rest, the name was changed to Kingston in 1826. It was the county seat for Washington County (formerly Kings County) from 1752 until 1894, when a new courthouse was built in nearby West Kingston. West Kingston is also the site of the historic Kingston Railroad Station which opened in June, 1875. The station is served by Amtrak on its Northeast Corridor. South Kingstown established the Kingston Historic District in 1959, and much of Kingston village became a National Register historic district in 1974 as Kingston Village Historic District. The historic district is located just outside the campus of the University of Rhode Island and contains many fine examples of 18th and 19th century architecture. The historic district includes 38 buildings. The University of Rhode Island was established at Kingston in 1888 as the Rhode Island Agricultural School and Agricultural Experiment Station, by funding from the Hatch Act of 1887. In 1892 the Agricultural School became the Rhode Island College of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts with funding from the Second Morrill Land Grant Act of 1890, later becoming Rhode Island State College in 1909 and the University of Rhode Island in 1951. ==Economy== In addition to the university, major businesses in Kingston include APC by Schneider Electric and the Arnold Lumber Company. ==Education== Public schools are operated by the South Kingstown School District.

As with his Gor series, his main body of work, Norman displays both philosophical reaction and an affinity with incorporating historical events with the actions of fictional characters. ==Outline== \\"There was little noticeable, little remarkable about Edward Chance, saving perhaps that he had once shot and killed a man....His craft, medicine, was more than a business with him, more than a professional skill. It was a way of healing his own heart too.\\" In Ghost Dance, it is through Chance's keen eyes and weary heart that readers travel along on a journey of discovery and sorrow. On the run across the plains, Chance stumbles upon Running Horse, a Sioux warrior enacting the sacred and violent ritual of the Sun Dance. Quickly, Chance is pulled into the world of the Sioux people. As their civilization teeters on the brink of destruction, the Sioux perform the mournful and frightening Ghost Dance. Clashes with the white man are rising; the Wounded Knee Massacre approaches, still in the unknown distance; and violence and anger threaten the traditions of a proud and once-great people. Nearby, in her quaint sod house, Miss Lucia Turner awaits the full impact of those clashes. Dust on the horizon signals great change coming to her once- simple life. Lucia will soon become a different kind of woman. With Ghost Dance, author John Norman brings the same vigor and passion of storytelling and imagination that enriches his classic Gor novels to a vivid story of historical upheaval and personal exploration.

T. Selbit performing a version of the trick in 1937 Sawing a woman in half is a generic name for a number of stage magic tricks in which a person (traditionally a female assistant) is apparently sawn or divided into two or more pieces. ==History== There remains a debate about the origin of sawing illusions, with some sources saying a magician named Torrini may have performed the first version in front of Pope Pius VII in 1809. However, it is more likely that the story is a fiction which has its roots in the writings of the famous French magician Jean Robert-Houdin. In his Memoirs, written in 1858, Robert-Houdin described a sawing illusion performed by a magician named Torrini. Modern magic inventor and historian Jim Steinmeyer has concluded that there was probably no real Torrini and the story was merely a way for Robert- Houdin to play with ideas. It was suggested during a court case in 1922 that the trick can be traced back to ancient Egypt; however, this claim has not been substantiated.Goldin v. Clarion Photoplays, New York (Dec 1922) The Yale Law Journal, Vol. 32, No. 2, p.201 Wherever the idea originated, until the 1920s it remained just an idea for an effect, rather than a practical application of a method. It is generally accepted that the first public performance of a sawing illusion was achieved by British magician P.T. Selbit in January 1921 at the Finsbury Park Empire theatre in London. In fact Selbit had previously performed the illusion in December 1920 before a select audience of promoters and theatrical agents at the St. George's Hall, London, to try to persuade one of them to book his new act for public shows. His trick, which he billed as \\"Sawing Through A Woman\\", was significantly different from what a modern audience would expect. Selbit's assistant was locked inside a closed wooden crate and could not be seen. The impression that she could not evade the saw was created by the confined space in the box and by ropes tied to her hands, feet, and neck, which were held throughout the illusion by spectators from the audience. The question of who was the first woman to be sawn in half has received much less publicity than the question of which magician first presented the illusion. According to Jim Steinmeyer the woman who participated in the December 1920 demonstration was Jan Glenrose, who was Selbit's main assistant at that time and who was also the partner of magician Fred Culpitt. In the public performance the role of victim was taken by principal assistant, Betty Barker. A later iteration of Horace Goldin's version of the trick, with a buzzsaw blade Later in 1921, Horace Goldin, a magician working in the United States, presented the first version which might look familiar to modern audiences. Goldin's assistant lay in a box from which her feet, head and hands protruded. Goldin sawed through the middle of the box, inserting metal sheets to cover the cut ends, and then pushed the two halves a little way apart. This process was then reversed, and the assistant released unharmed. Goldin later developed a sawing illusion that dispensed with boxes and used a large buzzsaw. The success of Selbit and then Goldin led to more and more magicians trying to imitate them with copies or improved versions of sawing illusions. By November 1921 the Thayer magic company in America was advertising a version for sale. A complete prop from Thayer would cost $175 or they would sell plans for $5. ==Effects and variations== There are many sawing tricks with significant differences in their basic effect. In some, the illusion is merely of a blade passing through an assistant's body, while in others it appears that the assistant is severed into two pieces that are moved apart. Some so-called \\"sawing\\" illusions do not actually involve a saw but instead use plain blades or blunt dividing panels. One major group of tricks involves an assistant in a box, which conceals her body from view while any cutting takes place. This group includes the \\"Selbit\\", \\"Wakeling\\" and \\"Thin Model\\" tricks as well as several versions associated with Horace Goldin. Most \\"box\\" sawings give the illusion of the two halves of the assistant being moved apart, although there are versions where the effect is simply that a blade must have passed through the assistant's body. In some versions the box completely covers the assistant while in others the assistant's head, hands and feet remain in view during the trick. ===The Selbit sawing=== Several volunteers are recruited from the audience. One or more of these people are invited to tie ropes around the assistant's wrists, ankles and neck. The assistant then steps into a wooden crate or box, which is similar in proportion to but slightly larger than a coffin. The ropes are threaded through holes in the box and the ends are given to volunteers, who are instructed to pull them tight and keep hold of them (the neck rope has an added knot to prevent the assistant being strangled). The assistant is thus secured in a standing spreadeagle position in the box. The box is then closed and lifted into a horizontal position on a set of trestles. The magician then slides glass plates through the crate (and apparently through his assistant). The magician then saws right through the centre of the box, dividing it into two. The sections are pulled slightly apart and the assistant's torso is visible. The impression is that the saw blade must have passed through the assistant's midriff. The assistant is then released from the box and is revealed to be unharmed. This was the illusion performed at the Finsbury Park Empire theatre in London on 17 January 1921. ===Goldin's box sawings=== Goldin presented several sawing illusions that involved a box. To audiences they all appeared largely similar but they involved differing methods, which were steadily improved as time went on and as earlier methods were exposed. filed 1923 accessdate = 2007-04-03 His first performance was at the Society of American Magicians annual banquet at the McAlpin Hotel, New York, on 3 June 1921. On that occasion the trick was not well received. The box he used was large and not very deceptive and instead of an attractive woman he employed a bellboy as an assistant. The impression given was that he was clumsily and hurriedly trying to cash in on Selbit's success in Britain. However, fellow magician Howard Thurston, who was in the audience, realised the potential of the trick and persuaded Goldin to let him help in its development. Thurston employed an established magician and prop builder named Harry Jansen to perfect the illusion. Jansen's improved version of the apparatus featured a smaller box from which the victim's head and feet would protrude during the sawing. Goldin, Thurston and various other magicians employed by Goldin toured the United States performing this trick with great success at theatres belonging to the Keith-Orpheum group. Goldin had great promotional acumen and was fond of resorting to legal action to block anyone else, including Selbit, from competing with him in the USA. As a result, Goldin was sometimes wrongly credited as the originator of the sawing illusion. The basic form of Goldin's box sawings was as follows. The magician presents a box which is similar in size and proportion to that used in the Selbit sawing but which is already in a horizontal position. An assistant climbs into the box and lies down. In the process her head and hands are seen to emerge from holes in one end of the box and her feet from the other. The box is closed and then sawn through across the middle. Dividers are placed into the box either side of the cut and it is then pulled apart so the sections can be seen clearly separated. The assistant's head and hands are seen sticking out of one section and her feet out of the other. The box is then pushed together again and opened and the assistant emerges unharmed. ===Wakeling=== The magician presents a rectangular table just big enough to accommodate a person lying upon it. An assistant is introduced and several assistants are recruited from the audience. The magician presents a set of restraints consisting of a sturdy collar and a pair of ankle straps, each attached to a length of chain or rope. The assistant sits on the table with her legs stretched out and volunteers are invited to fasten the restraints around her neck and ankles. The ropes or chains are threaded through holes in the table and the ends given to volunteers, who are instructed to pull them tight and hold them that way throughout the illusion. The assistant is thus pulled down onto her back and secured in that position. Two halves of a large box are presented and fixed in place over the assistant, covering her completely. Side panels are opened to show the assistant is still in place lying flat on her back. The assistant is then divided into two. Sometimes the division is accomplished merely by pushing two metal dividing panels into slots near where the two halves meet. Sometimes the cutting of the assistant is emphasised by sawing between the two halves of the box before sliding the dividers into place. Catches are released to allow the table to be separated into two halves along with the box. The halves are parted and the assistant thus appears to have been cut into two completely disconnected pieces. The box and table are then pushed together, the restraints are released and the box is opened to allow the assistant to emerge unharmed. This version of the trick is generally associated with magician and inventor Alan Wakeling. Whilst Wakeling performed this illusion and perfected aspects of it, the general configuration and method have been attributed to an earlier magician, Virgil Harris Mulkey (1900–1989), aka. \\"The Great Virgil\\", who first performed it in 1942 and later passed on the idea to Wakeling. ===The thin model=== The thin model sawing is one of the most common variants performed by contemporary magicians. The basic arrangement and sequence of events is similar to that described for the Goldin box sawings (see above). However, the box appears very shallow in comparison to Goldin's, which was large by modern standards. The ends of the box are initially open when the assistant climbs in. Once the assistant is lying down she is secured in place by having stocks placed over her neck and ankles. The stocks form the ends of the box. The shallow box adds to the impression that the assistant could not possibly find room to evade the saw blade even if she could release herself from the stocks and try to curl up in one half of the box. ===Transparent boxes=== Magician Les Arnold is reported to have been the first to have devised a clear box sawing (known as the \\"Crystal Sawing\\") as far back as 1976.Stephen Mulhern performing the UK TV debut of the Les Arnold Crystal Sawing on ITV's Magic Numbers The Pendragons performed a variation called \\"Clearly Impossible\\", in which the box used is both particularly slim and also transparent.The Pendragons performing Clearly Impossible in Cincinnati 1998 PBS TV Special The concept of \\"Clearly Impossible\\" has been credited to Jonathan Pendragon and the major distinguishing feature of The Pendragons' illusion from the Les Arnold concept is that the transparent boxes are seemingly never covered. ===Double sawing=== The \\"double sawing illusion\\" is a way of adding an extra effect to box-type sawings. It is generally associated with the \\"thin-model\\" sawing apparatus. The magician saws two people in half using two sets of apparatus. The people are usually chosen or dressed so as to be clearly distinguishable. For example, they might be in different colored costumes, of different skin colors, or of different genders. After the box halves are separated they are jumbled up and then re-assembled so that the bottom half of one box is matched to the top of the other and vice versa. When the victims emerge, each appears to have been given the other's lower half. The creation of this version has been credited to magician Alan Wakeling, who devised it for fellow magician Channing Pollock to perform. ===Jigsaw=== An assistant lies down on a table. A frame is placed over her middle. The magician then presents an electric jigsaw and proceeds to align the blade into a slot in the frame. The magician switches on the saw and apparently uses it to slice through the assistant's waist, which remains obscured by the frame. The saw emerges from the opposite side of the frame. Once the sawing is finished the frame is removed and the assistant is revealed to be in one piece. ===Bow saw=== This variant begins in a similar way to the jig sawing, with the assistant lying on a table and having a frame fixed over her midriff. The magician then presents a bow saw and proceeds to saw through the assistant, with the blade guided within the frame. Once the blade has apparently passed all the way through the assistant the frame is released and removed. It is then revealed that the assistant is encircled by the handle and blade of the bow saw. Then he/she will have a member of audience come up and look at the props. ===Buzzsaw=== A large apparatus is presented, consisting of a sturdy frame supporting a large buzzsaw or circular saw and a table sufficiently large to carry a person lying flat. It is shown that the table travels beneath the saw, leaving little or no gap, so that anything placed upon it in the path of the saw would be sliced through. The table is moved either by an electric mechanism or by some form of manual crank. The buzzsaw is generally driven by an electric motor. To demonstrate the saw is completely genuine, a piece of wood is placed on the table and sliced in two in full view. An assistant is introduced and placed in a horizontal position on the table. Sometimes the magician might give the impression of hypnotizing the assistant into a rigid trance before having her lifted onto the table. She is secured in place with two metal \\"straps\\" that close over her waist and which align close to the plane of the saw. She might also be further secured with straps or manacles at her wrists and ankles. A strip of wood is pushed beneath her waist in line with the saw. The saw is then started and the table set in motion. The saw visibly passes through the assistant and generally sounds like it is sawing through something. Once the table reaches the end of its travel and the saw is switched off the assistant is released and shown to be in one piece and uninjured. The strip of wood that had been placed beneath her is shown to have been sawn into two strips, thus reinforcing that the saw really did cut in the manner it appeared to. Harry Blackstone, Sr. was performing this effect in the United States in the 1930s. ===Death Saw=== The Death Saw is presented as an escape gone wrong. Its best known performer is David Copperfield. The performer is secured to a table beneath a large buzzsaw or blade, which is set to descend upon them under the control of a timing mechanism. After being secured with various manacles the performer is enclosed in a box. The saw is then set going. After a while the sides of the box fall away to reveal the performer struggling to escape the manacles. Finally the saw drops before the performer has time to escape. The blade slices right through the performer's body. The two halves of the table are rolled apart so that the performer is clearly separated into two sections. The performer then appears to command the whole process to reverse: The body halves go back together, the saw rises, the box closes. Finally the performer emerges unharmed from the box. Copperfield has claimed exclusive rights to this illusion; however, others, including Tennessee-based illusion builder Jeff Davis, have asserted that the method and effect were previously published in two magazine articles during the 1960s. The March 1965 edition of The Linking Ring contains text and diagrams from an Indian author called B. Rakshit giving the basic sawing method. An article in the September 1969 Genii Magazine outlines the routine including the idea of the saw descending a tower. ===Modern Art=== Although not generally classified as a \\"sawing\\" illusion, Modern Art is sometimes billed as an \\"upright dividing the lady in two\\". The prop is a vertical cabinet which stands alongside a table-like structure that is half its height. The assistant enters the cabinet through a door in the side away from the table structure. The assistant's face can be seen peering from an opening at the top of the cabinet and a panel at the bottom of the front of the cabinet is opened to show the assistant's legs. A sword or blade is then placed into a slot at the point where the top of the half-height table meets the cabinet. The top of the cabinet then slides across onto the table, giving the impression that the top half of the assistant has been moved sideways and in the process been severed from the legs by the blade. Panels in the front of the cabinet are opened to show the top and bottom halves of the assistant apparently separate. The top of the cabinet is then slid back into its original position and the assistant emerges unharmed. The effect and method are credited to designer Jim Steinmeyer. ===Criss Angel's pulling a woman apart=== Criss Angel performed a trick in which he appeared to pull a woman in half with his hands during an outdoor performance and half of her crawled away. The trick involved a woman with sacral agenesis and a contortionist. Magician and historian Ricky Jay has written that a version of this trick was previously performed by another magician. The magician that inspired Criss Angel's trick was Rajah Raboid, who performed this trick with Johnny Eck and his twin brother, Robert, in 1937. ==Methods and exposure== Variant 1. Variant 2. As suggested by the various effects, detailed above, there are numerous methods for accomplishing sawing illusions. Over the years a number of these have been exposed and several have been published and are easily obtainable. Publishing of magic methods has proved a controversial subject at times. It has involved battles between those determined to expose methods and magicians, who have sometimes resorted to legal action to try to preserve secrecy. The sawing illusion has had a prominent role in the history of such battles and has thus contributed to case law. In September 1921, motivated by concerns about preventing competition from other magicians who might copy him, Horace Goldin forwent secrecy and applied for a patent for Sawing a woman in half. He was awarded U.S. patent number 1,458,575 on 12 June 1923. The following is an outline summary the patent: Penn and Teller use the second variant of this trick on a regular basis in Las Vegas. They have also performed this trick on television at least twice: on Home Improvement and during the 2007 NBA All-Star Weekend. They always reveal how the trick is done. ==Famous performances and depictions== A number of performances or depictions of sawing illusions have achieved particular fame or notoriety. * P.T. Selbit's original performances in London in January 1921 were special because the effect was new and shocking to audiences of the time. Such was the impact of Selbit's creation that, for decades afterwards, other magicians would try to emulate and improve on what he had done, thus affecting the course of stage magic history.This performance was recreated in the final episode of the six-part BBC Television documentary series Magic, originally broadcast in 2004. See * In 1956, Indian illusionist P. C. Sorcar used a buzzsaw to cut his wife in two during a televised performance. Just when he had divided her the host quickly signed off and the show ended. This caused horrified viewers to believe she had accidentally been killed. In reality, it was a live television broadcast and time had run out.Dawes, A. E., et al. Making Magic. London: Multimedia Books, Ltd, 1993. * In the 1957 Friz Freleng cartoon Show Biz Bugs, Bugs Bunny asks for a volunteer for this trick, and Daffy Duck happily obliges, throughout attempting to expose the fraud of this trick. After the trick is over, Daffy tries to show the audience he isn't cut in half, only for his upper and lower halves to jump whenever he is angry. (His response: \\"Hmmph. It's a good thing I got Blue Cross.\\") * Live performances by Peruvian magician Richiardi Jr are often cited as the most horrific presentations of a sawing illusion. Richiardi used a buzzsaw prop similar to that employed by Sorcar but he greatly added to the shock value by incorporating fake blood and entrails, which were sprayed over the stage (and sometimes beyond it) as the saw went to work. *The 1962 Alfred Hitchcock Presents episode \\"The Sorcerer's Apprentice\\" depicted sawing a woman in half. The NBC Television Network and sponsor Revlon determined the episode was too gory and chose not to air it. ==Critical responses and twists== Jim Steinmeyer has argued that Selbit's introduction of the sawing illusion was a turning point in the history of magic after which gentler styles represented by the likes of John Nevil Maskelyne were in irreversible decline to be replaced by more sensational presentations that owed something to the shock effect of Grand Guignol theatre. In particular, Steinmeyer identifies the sawing illusion as the beginning of a fashion for magic featuring female assistants in the role of victim. He says the cliche of \\"pretty ladies teased and tortured by magicians\\" was not a cliche prior to Selbit's illusion. Male assistants were common in magic history and in the Victorian era; the cumbersome clothes imposed on women by the fashions of the time made it impractical for them to squeeze into confined spaces required by some tricks. Changing fashions in the early 20th century made Selbit's choice of a female victim a practical proposition. It was also true that an illusion designed for a lithe woman might be more compact and deceptive than one tailored to fit a man. However, more controversially, a combination of the emancipation of women and a population desensitized by war and exposed to new entertainment phenomena meant Selbit's choice struck a chord in the public imagination. In Steinmeyer's words: \\"beyond the practical concerns, the image of the woman in peril became a specific fashion in entertainment\\". Modern magicians, including female performers, have responded by placing a male performer in the role originally filled by a woman. Magician Dorothy Dietrich, who established herself as a leading magician as a teenager has been called the \\"First woman to saw a man in half.\\"The New York Times ==See also== * Clearly Impossible, variant on the trick * Zig Zag Girl another variant * Hemicorporectomy, when a person is actually cut in half ** Black Dahlia * Magician's assistant ==References== ==Further reading== * Jim Steinmeyer, Art and Artifice: And other essays of illusion.

The battle is considered the initial engagement of the North- West Rebellion. Although Louis Riel proved to be victorious at Duck Lake, the general agreement among historians is that the battle was strategically a disappointment to his cause. ==Prelude== On March 19, 1885, Louis Riel self- affirmed the existence of the new Provisional Government of Saskatchewan. Following Riel's declaration, the Canadian government sought to reassert their control over the turbulent territory. Leif Crozier, the newly appointed NWMP superintendent and commander of North-Western Saskatchewan's forces, requested immediate reinforcement to Fort Carlton because he feared the growing instability created by Riel and the ever-growing possibility of a First Nations uprising. Riel dispatched emissaries to deliver an ultimatum calling for the surrender of Fort Carlton without bloodshed. Crozier's representatives rejected the demand and vowed that the Métis leaders would be brought to justice. On March 25, in need of supplies for his men and horses, Crozier ordered Sergeant Alfred Stewart, Thomas McKay, and seventeen constables to Hillyard Mitchell's general goods store at Duck Lake. Unbeknownst to Crozier, however, commander Gabriel Dumont (Riel's right-hand man) and his Métis force had already entrenched themselves on the road to Duck Lake. On the morning of the 26th, Stewart's party encountered the band of Métis near Duck Lake. After ample harassment, Stewart decided not to risk a physical engagement, and chose to return to Fort Carlton; no shooting occurred. Crozier rallied together a larger force, which included 53 North-West Mounted Police non-commissioned officers and men, 41 men of the Prince Albert Volunteers, and a 7-pound cannon, and set out to secure the much-needed supplies and to reassert the authority of the Canadian government in the District of Saskatchewan. ==Battle== The forces met about outside Duck Lake on a snowy plateau covered by trees, shrubs, and a few log cabins. Having spotted Crozier's force, Gabriel Dumont ordered his men to set up defensive positions around the log cabin and lie in wait. Similarly, Crozier's scouts informed the superintendent of the movements of the Métis; subsequently, Crozier ordered his men to halt and deploy their sleighs parallel to the road which was just before them. Both sides took up defensive positions. Gabriel Dumont dispatched his brother, Isidore, and an elderly half-blind chief, Assiwiyin, with a white flag in hopes of distracting Crozier's forces. The superintendent, believing that Dumont was interested in a parley, walked forward with an English Métis interpreter, \\"Gentleman\\" Joe McKay. During the half-hearted discussion, Crozier came to believe that Isidore and Assiwiyin were stalling so that the Métis force could manoeuver to flank his own men. As they began to leave, both Assiwiyin and Isidore attempted to draw their guns, prompting Crozier to give McKay the order to fire. A brief scuffle ensued between the two parties, which resulted in McKay shooting, and killing, both Isidore and Assiwyin. Despite the firepower and training of Crozier's militia, the Métis force were more numerous and their position within the log cabins and the tree line proved to be an efficient advantage. In an attempt to relieve the pressure on the Prince Albert Volunteers, Crozier ordered the 7-pound cannon to target the log cabins. After numerous discharges, a shell was placed in before the power charge was inserted, which disabled the cannon for the remainder of the battle. Within half an hour, Crozier recognized the unavoidable and sounded a general retreat back to Fort Carlton. The Métis were eager to chase down Crozier and his retreating force, but Louis Riel intervened and declared the battle over. ==Aftermath== The battle toll was high for the government forces. Twelve men were killed, and eleven men seriously injured. For the opposing side, five Métis warriors were killed in the skirmish, including Dumont's brother. Furthermore, Gabriel Dumont himself was injured in the head by a passing bullet. Losing to Riel and the Métis force came as a great shock to Crozier's superiors. Colonel Acheson Irvine, Crozier's supervisor, suggested that Crozier's officerial prowess and judgement was overruled by impulsiveness. Fort Carlton, a trading post with few defensive installations, was now in serious risk of attack. Immediately, Colonel Irvine summoned a council to discuss the future of Fort Carlton. The resounding unanimous decision was in favour of the evacuation and destruction of the fort. By 4 AM on 28 March, the last sleigh had left the smouldering fort. In the span of three days and with the loss of only five men, Riel's forces had defeated Crozier's militia, forced the destruction and scavenged the remains of Fort Carlton, and spread fear of a Métis uprising throughout the North-West Territories. Riel's plans were not completely successful, though: he had hoped to capture Crozier and his men as hostages so that he might force the government's hand. Thus, while tactically successful, the battle of Duck Lake proved to be a strategic disappointment for Riel. ==Legacy== The site of the battle was designated a National Historic Site of Canada in 1924. In the spring of 2008, Tourism, Parks, Culture and Sport Minister Christine Tell proclaimed in Duck lake, that \\"the 125th commemoration, in 2010, of the 1885 Northwest Resistance is an excellent opportunity to tell the story of the prairie Métis and First Nations peoples' struggle with Government forces and how it has shaped Canada today.\\" Duck Lake is home to the Duck Lake Historical Museum and the Duck Lake Regional Interpretive Centre, and murals which reflect the history of the rebellion in the area. The Battle of Duck Lake, the Duck Lake Massacre, and a buffalo jump are all located here. The \\"First Shots Cairn\\" was erected on Saskatchewan Highway 212 as a landmark commemorating the scene of the first shots in the Battle of Duck Lake. The Our Lady of Lourdes Shrine at St. Laurent north of Duck Lake is a local pilgrimage site. ==See also== * List of battles won by Indigenous peoples of the Americas * North- West Rebellion * Provisional Government of Saskatchewan * Prince Albert Volunteers * North-West Mounted Police ==References== ;Sources * - 1910 edition; * * - First Edition (1936) available at University of Alberta Library * ==Further reading== * * * The Story of Saskatchewan and its people Volume 1 (Duck Lake) ==External links== Duck Lake Category:National Historic Sites in Saskatchewan Category:March 1885 events Duck Lake ","title":"Battle of Duck Lake"},{"id":"1281952","text":"An Iraqi man comes to vote for the first elections in Iraq following the 2003 war CRS police, given the possibility of disruption. Voting in Washington, DC, USA Parliamentary elections were held in Iraq on 30 January 2005 to elect the new National Assembly, alongside governorate elections and a parliamentary election in Kurdistan Region. The 275-member legislature had been created under the Transitional Law during the international occupation. The newly elected body was given a mandate to write a new constitution and exercise legislative functions until the new constitution came into effect. The elections also led to the formation of the Iraqi Transitional Government. The United Iraqi Alliance, tacitly backed by Shia Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, emerged as the largest bloc with 48% of the vote. The Democratic Patriotic Alliance of Kurdistan was in second place with 26%, whilst interim Prime Minister Ayad Allawi's party, the Iraqi List, came third with 14%. In total, twelve parties received enough votes to win a seat in the assembly. Low turnout amongst Sunni Arabs threatened the legitimacy of the elections, with voter turnout as low as 2% in Al Anbar Governorate. More than 100 armed attacks on polling places took place, killing at least 44 people (including nine suicide bombers) across the country, including at least 20 in Baghdad. ==Background== In November 2003, the US-managed Coalition Provisional Authority had announced plans to turn over sovereignty to an Iraqi Interim Government by mid-2004. The actual transfer of sovereignty occurred on 28 June 2004. The interim president installed was Sheikh Ghazi Mashal Ajil al-Yawer, and the interim prime minister was Ayad Allawi, a man who had been a CIA asset according to former American intelligence officials.Commondreams.org , New York Times, June 9, 2004 The voting represented the first general election since the United States-led 2003 invasion of Iraq, and marked an important step in the transition of turning control of the country over from United States occupation forces to the Iraqis themselves. Iraqi police officers hold up their index fingers marked with purple indelible ink, a security measure to prevent double voting. The election was seen by some as a victory for democracy in the Middle East, but that opinion is not shared by all, especially as most of the Arab Sunnis boycotted the vote. Seymour Hersh has reported that there was an effort by the American government to shift funds and other resources to Allawi and that there may have been similar under-the- table dealings by other parties. Although he did not get the most seats in the Transitional Assembly, Allawi's delegation jumped from a projected 3-4% of the vote to 14% of the vote, giving him power in the writing of the Constitution. Two parties supported by the majority Shi'a (or Shiite) Muslim community between them won a majority of seats, while parties representing the Kurdish community will also be strongly represented. Parties representing the Sunni Arab community boycotted the elections and some armed Sunni groups threatened election day violence. There were 44 deaths around polling stations in at least 9 separate attacks on election day. With a total of some 8.4 million votes cast, a 58% turnout, the Iraqi Electoral Commission considers the election to have taken place without major disruption. Voter turnout ranged from 89% in the Kurdish region of Dahuk to two percent in the Sunni region of Anbar. After the legislative elections held in December 2005, where 76,4% of registered voters participated, the Iraqi government is considered by 44 international governments to be a legitimate government. According to the American administration, the judiciary in Iraq operates under the primacy of rule of law, so those convicted of war crimes from the former regime of Saddam Hussein will get an open trial, in which their rights will be subjected to due process and be protected by the scrutiny of a free press, the requirements of modern court proceedings. There has however been considerable criticism of criminal justice system presently operating in Iraq. ===Transitional Law=== The Transitional Law required a two-thirds majority of the new assembly to select the new presidents, who appointed the Prime Minister who took office after receiving a simple majority vote of confidence from the assembly. Eighteen Governorate Councils and a 111-member council of the Kurdistan Regional Government were also elected. The Iraqi Transitional Assembly would: *Serve as Iraq's national legislature. It has named a Presidency Council, consisting of a President and two Vice Presidents. (By unanimous agreement, the Presidency Council will appoint a Prime Minister and, on his recommendation, cabinet ministers.) *Draft Iraq's new constitution. This constitution was presented to the Iraqi people for their approval in a national referendum in October 2005. Under the new constitution, Iraq would elect a permanent government in December 2005 as new legislative elections were held for the Council of Representatives of Iraq. Under the Transitional Administrative Law, signed March 2004, the country's executive branch was led by a three-person presidential council. The election system for the council effectively ensures that all three of Iraq's major ethnic / religious groups are represented. The constitution also includes basic freedoms like freedom of religion, speech, and assembly, and is perceived by some to be more progressive than the American Constitution. Controversially, however, it states that all laws that were in effect on the transfer date cannot be repealed. Furthermore, since the coalition forces are currently working to maintain order and create a stable society under the United Nations, coalition troops can remain in effective control of the country despite the transfer of sovereignty. Since Iraqi forces were then considered not fully trained and equipped to police and secure their country, it was expected that coalition troops will remain until Iraqi forces no longer required their support. ==Electoral system== The members of the National Assembly were elected by proportional representation using the Hare quota and the largest remainder method with a threshold of one quota. At least every third candidate on each list had to be female. The Independent Electoral Commission of Iraq (IHEC) also held an \\"Out-of-Country Registration and Voting Program\\"; it was conducted by the International Organization for Migration (IOM). The goal of the program was to enable approximately one million eligible voters living outside Iraq to participate in the election of the transitional National Assembly. There are 280,303 registered expatriates. By far the largest group of those eligible to vote are in Iran with significant populations in a number of western countries. Iraqi expatriates voted from January 28 to January 30, 2005. International voters could place their ballots in fourteen countries: Australia, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Iran, Jordan, Netherlands, Sweden, Syria, Turkey, United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom and the United States. ==Conduct== ===Violence and disruption=== Armed Islamist, Ba'athist and other groups, which have carried out a campaign of bombings and assassinations in Iraq since the beginning of the occupation in 2003 (see Iraqi insurgency), threatened to disrupt the elections by suicide bombing and other violent tactics. Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, head of the al-Qaida affiliate in Iraq, said: \\"We have declared a fierce war on this evil principle of democracy and those who follow this wrong ideology. Anyone who tries to help set up this system is part of it\\". He also made it clear that al-Qaida opposes elections in Iraq because they will result in a Shi'a-dominated government. He alleged that \\"the Shiites aim to begin spreading their evil faith among people through money and fear,\\"ABCnews.go.com A rigid security clampdown succeeded in preventing major disruption of the polling. In most parts of the country Iraqis were able to vote freely. More than 100 armed attacks on polling places took place, killing at least 44 people (including nine suicide bombers) across Iraq, including at least 20 in Baghdad. However, threats by opponents of the election to \\"wash the streets in blood\\" were not fulfilled. A member of the Iraqi Security Force hands out pamphlets and provides security at a polling site in Nasarwasalam. With civilian cars banned from roads for security, hundreds of residents of the Al Monsour district of Baghdad walk along a freeway to the polls. An unnamed al-Qaida affiliate dismissed the elections as \\"theatrics\\" and promised to continue waging \\"holy war\\" against coalition forces. \\"These elections and their results ... will increase our strength and intention to getting rid of injustice,\\" read the statement, which was posted to an Islamist web site. ===Boycotts=== One challenge to the legitimacy of the election was the low Arab Sunni turnout, which was as low as 2% in Anbar province. Areas with mixed populations saw the vast majority of voters back Shi'ite or Kurdish parties. The largest Arab Sunni party, The Iraqis, won only 1.78% of the vote (for comparison, Arab Sunnis are thought to be 15-20% of the population). The boycott was largely a product of the threatened violence. The violence is centered in the Arab Sunni areas and the Arab Sunni party leaders felt that it would be impossible to hold fair elections in their areas. Major Arab Sunni parties such as the Iraqi Islamic Party and the Association of Muslim Scholars, boycotted the elections, as did some smaller groups such as the Worker-Communist Party of Iraq. The major Arab Sunni groups called for elections to be postponed until the safety of voters could be guaranteed. This call for a delay was supported by some in the west, but any such scheme was strongly opposed by the Shi'a parties. Despite the boycott and the resulting tiny Arab Sunni representation in the assembly, the major party leaders have assured the Arab Sunnis that they will have input into the new constitution. It is also expected that at least one of the major government positions will go to an Arab Sunni. Small groups of protesters around the United States demonstrated in support of the boycott of the Iraq elections and against the occupation of Iraq. They claim that for an Iraqi election to have meaning America should not be \\"orchestrating the process\\". Scott Ritter has alleged that America has partially rigged the election to reduce the percentage won by the United Iraqi Alliance from 56% to 48%. No evidence has been provided to support these allegations.UFPPC.org ===Observers=== Hundreds of voters line up outside a polling place in Baghdad. The election was monitored from outside of Iraq by the International Mission for Iraqi ElectionsIMIE.ca made up of members from nine nations and headed by Canada. It was supported by the United Nations but was not a UN operation. The UN recused itself from monitoring the election as it had played a central role in setting up the election. A number of UN staffers worked within the Iraqi electoral commission setting up the election and are considered by some to be de facto international observers. It proved impossible to find monitors that would actually monitor the election from within the country. Rather the IMIE observers were based in Amman, Jordan and monitored the election from there. There were also representatives in Baghdad, generally the staff in the embassies of the IMIE nations. The absentee poll held in fourteen countries around the world were monitored by a wide array of IGO and NGOs, but these groups were unwilling to monitor the election in Iraq itself. It is highly unusual to base the monitoring team outside of the country where the election is being held, but the observers decided this was necessary for safety reasons. Among other security precautions all but the head of the mission, Canadian Jean-Pierre Kingsley, remained anonymous. The main burden on monitoring the election thus fell to Iraqi representatives on the ground who sent reports to Amman. The majority of these volunteers were some 35,000 partisan scrutineers representing the parties competing in the election. Another 21,000 non-partisan volunteers were recruited by a variety of agencies and NGOs.Canoe.ca The observers assert that despite the unusual circumstances the election was adequately monitored. Others disagree arguing that the IMIE was created to rubber stamp the American-created elections. At the close of the polls, Kingsley stated that \\"the Iraqi elections generally meet international standards,\\" while a preliminary assessment released after polling closed said that areas needing improvement included \\"transparency regarding financial contributions and expenditures, improvements to the voter registration process and reviewing the criteria for candidate eligibility.\\"Boston.com The final report is available on the IMIE Web site.IMIE.ca ==Results== Election results by alliance Provisional results released on February 13 showed that the United Iraqi Alliance, tacitly backed by Shi'a leader Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, led with some 48% of the vote. The Democratic Patriotic Alliance of Kurdistan was in second place with some 26% of the vote. Prime Minister Ayad Allawi's party, the Iraqi List, came third with some 14%. In total, twelve parties received enough votes to win a seat in the assembly. Abdul Aziz al-Hakim at a polling station in Baghdad. His United Iraqi Alliance won the most seats in this election. :More info: Complete results The majority of the 111 lists that competed in the election did not win seats. The most prominent party to be excluded was the secular, but predominantly Sunni, Independent Democrats Movement led by former exile Adnan Pachachi. It only received some 12,000 votes. Other prominent parties that failed to win seats include the monarchist Constitutional Monarchy Movement, and the Movement of Free Military Officers and Civilians. { class= style=text-align:right !colspan=2Party !Votes !% !Seats -

It also appointed Adel Abdul Mehdi, a Shiite Arab, and Ghazi al-Yawar, the former Interim President and a Sunni Arab, as Vice Presidents. Ibrahim al-Jaafari a Shiite, whose United Iraq Alliance Party won the largest share of the vote, was appointed the new Prime Minister of Iraq. Most power was vested in him. The new government was faced with two major tasks. The first was to attempt to rein in a violent insurgency, which had blighted the country in recent months, killing many Iraqi civilians and officials as well as a number of American troops. (As of mid-2005, approximately 135,000 American troops remained in Iraq with 2,214 American soldiers killed.) The second major task was to re-engage in the writing of a new Iraqi constitution, as outlined above, to replace the Transitional Administrative Law of 2004. ==References== ==External links== * Zaid Al-Ali, The Struggle for Iraq's Future, Yale University Press (2014) * The Economist: Iraqi legislative election who's who (pay site) * BBC: Questions and Answers on the Iraqi election, Discussion of some of the main lists and candidates * The Iraqi and Vietnamese Elections * Full results by governorate Iraq Category:2005 elections in Iraq Category:Elections in Iraq Category:January 2005 events in Asia ","title":"January 2005 Iraqi parliamentary election"},{"id":"1281968","text":"Joel Anthony Crothers (January 28, 1941 – November 6, 1985) was an American actor. His credits primarily included stage and television work, including a number of soap opera roles, the best known being that of Miles Cavanaugh on The Edge of Night, who he played for eight years. He was also known for his roles as Joe Haskell and Lt. Nathan Forbes on Dark Shadows. ==Early years== Born in Cincinnati and raised in New York City, Crothers graduated from Birch Wathen School in 1958. His passion for performing emerged at the early age of nine. Crothers auditioned and won a role on the CBS religious TV series Lamp Unto My Feet. At the time, his father was a production supervisor on the show. Unbeknownst to him, his son auditioned for the show under a different name, apparently done as a practical joke. Nevertheless, by the age of twelve, he was taking Broadway bows alongside Burgess Meredith for his stage debut in 1954 in The Remarkable Mr. Pennypacker at the Coronet Theatre. ==Career== During the 1950s and 1960s, Crothers made guest appearances on numerous prime- time programs, including Alfred Hitchcock Presents, The Defenders, Have Gun – Will Travel, Rescue 8, Zane Grey Theater, Studio One, Playhouse 90, Kraft Television Theatre, and Goodyear Playhouse. His later daytime television credits included First Ladies Diaries: Martha Washington. Crothers was cast in the 1960 episode, \\"3-7-77\\", of the syndicated anthology series, Death Valley Days hosted by Stanley Andrews. He played Jim Badger, a young man who tangles with corrupt lawmen and vigilantes. Crothers graduated from Harvard University, Phi Beta Kappa, in 1962. In 1966, he returned to Broadway in a starring role opposite Joan Van Ark in Barefoot in the Park, which he worked on simultaneously with his stint on Dark Shadows. From 1966 to 1969, he played Joe Haskell, boyfriend of Carolyn Stoddard (Nancy Barrett) and later boyfriend of Maggie Evans (Kathryn Leigh Scott). During the 1795 storyline, he played Lt. Nathan Forbes, a devious naval officer who blackmailed his way into the Collins family. After Nathan Forbes was killed off, Crothers' main character, Joe, was bitten by the vampiric Angélique and placed under her thrall. Haunted by the apparition of his deceased cousin Tom (a victim of vampire Angélique) and unable to cope with the revelation that Tom's twin brother Chris was a werewolf, Joe slowly lost touch with reality and was sent to a mental hospital by Maggie. He was never seen again and was mentioned only once in a later episode. From 1969 to 1971, he played twice-married cheat and liar Ken Stevens #2 on the CBS serial The Secret Storm. Several of his 1971 episodes have been preserved by UCLA's TV Archives, though the magnetic VHS tapes are awaiting digital transfer and are not available for viewing by the public. From 1972 to 1976, he played concert pianist-turned-newspaper editor Julian Cannell on Somerset. From 1977 to 1984, he made it big with another soap opera role: Dr. Miles Cavanaugh on ABC's The Edge of Night, for which he was twice nominated as Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series at the Daytime Emmy Awards in 1979 and 1984. He played that role until the series went off the air on December 28, 1984. In 1985, his final role was on Santa Barbara as both Jack Lee, a prominent attorney, and his villainous lookalike cousin Jerry Cooper, who had locked Jack in a dungeon and was posing as him. Crothers' soap opera fame helped draw attention to the ground-breaking off-Broadway play Torch Song Trilogy. The play made major stars of its writer (and lead performer) Harvey Fierstein and castmates Estelle Getty and Matthew Broderick—but when it premiered, Crothers was better known than any of them and received star billing on posters, playbills, and even the tickets. Fierstein played Arnold, a world-weary drag queen; Crothers played Alan’s bisexual lover, Ed. He left the cast when Torch Song transferred to Broadway. Brian Kerwin played Ed in the film version. ==Personal life== Though he had been openly gay among co- stars and others in the entertainment industry, Crothers was closeted publicly and was engaged to his good friend, actress Veleka Gray at the time of his death.

Dodd worked at Beard's camp in Pennsylvania for 13 summers, where he honed his writing and illustration skills under Beard's guidance. Dodd became a scoutmaster and the first paid Youth and Physical Education Director for the city of Gainesville, Georgia. ==Back Home Again== After studying architecture at Georgia Tech and at the Art Students League of New York, he purchased a ranch in Wyoming in 1926. In 1930, while working as a guide in the national parks, he created Back Home Again, a moderately successful daily single-panel which included characters from Gainesville and North Georgia. The panel, about a hillbilly family, was distributed nationally by United Feature Syndicate until 1945. ==Mark Trail== On April 15, 1946, he launched Mark Trail as a daily comic strip distributed by The New York Post to 45 newspapers. Mark Trail centers on environmental themes and its title character, a wildlife photographer and author whose assignments inevitably lead to involvement in local environmental conflicts. Trail was a younger \\"alter ego\\" of Dodd (Gurr 2006), likewise a pipe-smoking outdoorsman and conservationist but footloose and free to travel to adventure. Trail owned a St. Bernard named Andy and lived (between travels) with Doc and Cherry Davis in Lost Forest. Likewise, Dodd had a St. Bernard named Andy, and owned a home and studio (designed by Frank Lloyd Wright's student Herbert Millkeyhttps://smartech.gatech.edu/handle/1853/51273) in a forest in North Georgia that he named Lost Forest. Dodd's challenge with this alter ego was to write an educational outdoors-themed continuity strip, in varied settings, about a good-guy conservationist who nevertheless remained credible as a man in his responses to exploiters and to underdogs, and to romance and to hardship. At its peak in the 1960s, the strip enjoyed distribution to about 500 newspapers through North America Syndicate and spun off numerous publications about camping and wildlife. Mark Trail was written by Dodd and drawn by Tom Hill until the latter's death in 1978. Dodd then retired, and the strip was continued by his long-time assistant, Jack Elrod, and later by James Allen. Dodd enjoyed wide respect for his support of conservation, and among his honors was Georgia Conservationist of the Year in 1967. On the occasion of the 40th anniversary of Mark Trail in 1986, he told a reporter that he had quit Georgia Tech's architecture program because of failing grades in math and chemistry. \\"In my case, finishing college would have been a mistake,\\" he said. \\"I'd probably have become a mediocre architect and starved to death.\\" Towards the end of his life, he established the Mark Trail/Ed Dodd Foundation. He died in Gainesville in 1991, survived by his fourth wife, Rosemary, who still resides in Gainesville. That same year, the U.S. Congress honored Dodd's hero with the Mark Trail Wilderness in the Chattahoochee National Forest. Dodd's 130-acre Lost Forest is now residential neighborhoods, one bearing the name \\"Lost Forest\\" with a street named \\"Mark Trail\\". In 1996, the house formerly occupied by Dodd in Lost Forest burned to the ground (Hill 2003). ==Works== *Mark Trail's 2nd book of animals: (North American mammals), by Ed Dodd, 1959 *Mark Trail's Book of Animals (North American Mammals), by Ed Dodd, 1965 *Flapfoot (Carousel book), by Ed Dodd, 1968 *Chipper the Beaver (A See and read beginning to read book), by Ed Dodd, 1968 *Mark Trail's Hunting Tips, by Ed Dodd, 1969 *Careers for the '70s: conservation (Crowell-Collier careers), by Ed Dodd, 1971 *Mark Trail's Cooking Tips, by Ed Dodd, 1971 *Mark Trail's Camping Tips, by Ed Dodd, 1971 *Mark Trail in the Smokies!: A Naturalist's Look at Great Smokey Mountains National Park and the Southern Appalachians, by Ed Dodd, 1989 == Sources== *Georgia Tech Alumni.

Gore Jr. and the wife of former United States Senator Albert A. Gore. She is credited with playing a significant role in both of their careers with Al Gore saying \\"there will never be a better campaigner than Pauline LaFon Gore\\". Her advice was an important factor in his refusal to sign the \\"Southern Manifesto\\" opposing desegregation and his opposition to the Vietnam War which were critical issues in his bid for re-election as a Senator in 1970. She came from a poor family in small business to become one of the first female lawyers to graduate from Vanderbilt University and managed a Washington law firm in the 1970s. ==Early life== She was born in Palmersville, Tennessee as one of six children. Her parents, Maude (née Gatlin) and Walter L. LaFon,Ancestry of Al Gore (b. 1948) ran a general store. When her father was injured, the family moved to Jackson, Tennessee, where her father worked for the Tennessee highway department. Despite the fact that her family was struggling and it was the Great Depression, Pauline LaFon was determined to graduate from college and waited on tables in order to pay her way. From 1931 to 1933, she attended Union University, but did not earn a degree from that institution until nearly seven decades later where she was granted an honorary degree. In 1936, she became the 10th woman to graduate from Vanderbilt University Law School. She met Albert Gore Sr. while waiting tables at the Andrew Jackson Hotel while he was studying for a law degree as well as farming and acting as the Commissioner for Schools. They ended up studying together for the bar exam where Pauline LaFon obtained a higher mark than Albert Gore Sr. Following graduation from Vanderbilt, she practiced law in Texarkana, Arkansas for a year before returning to Tennessee and married Albert Gore Sr on April 17, 1937. She practiced in oil and gas law and also divorce law, being one of the first women to practice law in those fields. ==Political wife 1937-1970== Al Gore Sr. was a rising man in the Tennessee political system when he married Pauline LaFon. He was appointed State Labor Commissioner later the same year and was elected to Congress a year later. The Gores' elder child Nancy LaFon Gore Hunger was born in 1938 as well. When Al Gore Sr., was elected to Congress in 1938, it was traditional for political wives to stay in the background and not play an active role in their husbands' political lives. However, she took Eleanor Roosevelt as a role model and actively stumped for Gore's first campaign speaking at clubs and extensively canvassing in the rural parts of the electorate. Pauline Gore would play an active role in all of her husband's campaigns as his closest adviser. In 1952, Albert Gore Sr., ran for the Senate standing in the Democratic primary against Kenneth McKellar, who was the powerful chair of the Senate Appropriarions Committee. Due to his position, McKellar was in a strong position to win funding for Tennessee. In order to remind voters of his access in Washington, McKellar used the slogan \\"The thinking fellar votes McKellar\\". In order to counter this slogan, Pauline Gore suggested placing signs with the slogan \\"Think some more and vote for Gore\\" close by McKellar's signs. Albert Gore Sr. won the primary in what was an upset and the tactic played an important part in the victory. The Gores' second child, Al Gore Jr., was born on March 31, 1948. During his childhood, the family would live in Washington for much of the year and return to the family home in Carthage, Tennessee for the summer. Al Gore often referred to her as his \\"greatest teacher\\". Pauline Gore was influential in many committees of Senators' wives when she was in Washington. During Albert Gore Sr's career as a Senator, Pauline Gore was one of his closest advisers. Her views were influential in Al Gore's decision not to sign the \\"Southern Declaration on Integration\\" opposing desegregation issued in 1956 by all but three southern Senators. Al Gore Sr. was briefly a candidate for the Democratic nomination as Vice-President but bowed out in favour of fellow Tennessee Senator Estes Kefauver who was nominated. Later on, she advised her husband to oppose the Vietnam War, which was highly controversial in the electorate. ==Lawyer, mother, and grandmother 1970-2004== After the defeat of her husband, Pauline Gore resumed her law career in Washington. Her husband joined with her in establishing a law firm together. She later became the managing partner of Peabody, Rivlin, Gore, Claudous and Brashares, a large law firm in Washington, and became a mentor to young women starting their legal careers. Al Gore ran for election to Congress in 1976, and Pauline Gore campaigned for him. She would help in most of his campaigns, although she would not play as active a role in his political career as she did in her husband's career. She also offered counsel to Phil Bredesen, later mayor of Nashville. She campaigned for Al Gore in 1988 in his unsuccessful bid to become the Democratic nominee for President. In 1992, she joined her husband in campaigning for the Clinton-Gore ticket on a seven-week bus trip across the United States with many visits to senior citizens' clubs. She had a mild stroke in 1993 and had a heart attack in 1995. Albert Gore Sr. died on December 5, 1998. After receiving a humanitarian award in 1998, she established a scholarship fund for residents of Smith County, Tennessee to enable poor people from that county to attend college. In 1999, the Vanderbilt University law school named her as its Distinguished Alumna for the year, the first woman to be so honored. She died in her sleep at her home in Carthage on December 15, 2004. ==References== ==External links== *The Women Who Made Al Gore *Pauline Gore, Mother of Former VP Dies *Pauline Gore receives degree from Union Univ. at age 87 * *Transcript of Al Gore's speech on presentation of honorary degree by Union College to Pauline LaFon Gore *Information on Pauline LaFon Gore scholarship *Governor Bredesen's statement on the death of Pauline LaFon Gore * Category:1912 births Category:2004 deaths Category:Arkansas lawyers Pauline LaFon Gore Category:Mothers of Vice Presidents of the United States Category:People from Weakley County, Tennessee Category:People from Jackson, Tennessee Category:Tennessee Democrats Category:Tennessee lawyers Category:Union University alumni Category:Vanderbilt University alumni Category:Vanderbilt University Law School alumni Category:Lawyers from Washington, D.C.

Medina Lake extends north of it in northeastern Medina County and southeastern Bandera County. The dam and irrigation project was designed and financed by Dr. Frederick Stark Pearson, an American engineer, with extensive British financial backing. The construction took over 1500 men two years to build while working 24 hours a day. They were mostly skilled Mexican workers with experience building other dams for Pearson. They received two dollars for a day's work, which were good wages for the time.Using average annual wage from a 1910 census, $574, and dividing by 365 days (a year) gives us an average daily wage of $1.57. $2/day is 127% of the average daily wage Pearson's Medina Irrigation Company (MICO) built a camp to house the workers and their families; the company town was first called MICO after its acronym. The community is now known as Mico, Texas. When the dam was completed in 1913, it was the largest hydraulic engineering project west of the Mississippi River and the fourth-largest dam in the US.Ruben E. Ochoa, \\"Medina County\\", Handbook of Texas Online, accessed 3 Aug 2010 It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places for its significance as an infrastructure project and its contributions to economic development of the county. Author of Ripples from Medina Lake, Rev. Cyril M. Kuehne claims a total of 70 lives were taken during the dam's construction, however, he only managed to locate 27 death certificates. Dr. Oscar B. Taylor, dentist of near-by settlement Hondo, Texas, was quoted by Kuehne as saying \\"sixty-six [unmarked] graves\\" were counted at a cemetery 3 miles away. The dam contains over 292,000 cubic yards (223,000 m³) of concrete and measures 164 feet high by 128 feet (39 m) wide at the base by 1,580 feet (482 m) long. It is 25 feet (8 m) wide at the top, which is 1076.2 feet (328 m) above sea level, and the spillway is 1,064.2 feet (324 m) above sea level. The dam provides irrigation to over 34,000 acres (138 km²) to Blackland Prairie farmlands below the Balcones Escarpment around Castroville, Texas, and also supplies water to the Medina River Ultrafiltration Water Treatment Plant owned and operated by the San Antonio Water System. The reservoir behind the dam is called Medina Lake and is a major recreation area. It discharges into the Medina River, which also contains a diversion dam four miles downstream. Medina Dam was once a publicly accessible, one-lane roadway that connected to County Road 260, from the time of its creation until 1980 when vehicle traffic was closed and rerouted to a new road known has County Road 264; although temporary use of the dam as a road continued in 1990. == Historical State Markers on the Dam == Located on the dam and currently inaccessible to the public are three state-placed historical markers. === 1936 Mountain Valley marker === The earliest of the three markers is a 1936 state marker that acknowledges the previous Mormon settlement, Mountain Valley that was built in 1854 and was destroyed in 1913 during construction of the dam.

Reynolds was a New York-based anchor of the ABC Evening News from 1968 to 1970 and later was the Washington, D.C.-based co-anchor of World News Tonight from 1978 until his death in 1983. During the Iran hostage crisis, he began the 30-minute late-night program America Held Hostage, which later was renamed Nightline, and then taken over by Ted Koppel. ==Background== Born in East Chicago, Indiana, Reynolds attended Bishop Noll Institute in Hammond and Wabash College in Crawfordsville. He was a member of Lambda Chi Alpha fraternity. Reynolds served in the U.S. Army during World War II; he was a staff sergeant (E-6) in the infantry and was awarded the Purple Heart. ==Early career== After the war, Reynolds began his broadcast career in Indiana with WWCA-AM in Gary. (He also had an early career stint with WJOB-AM in nearby Hammond, Indiana). Reynolds was a television anchor in Chicago, first on the original WBKB in 1949, which in 1953 would become WBBM-TV, the CBS owned-and-operated station; he also served as Chicago correspondent for CBS News. In 1963, he moved to the second WBKB, an ABC owned-and-operated station (now known as WLS-TV) and served as their main news anchor. Reynolds joined ABC News in 1965 as a correspondent. ==Anchor, ABC News== By 1968, he became co-anchor of the ABC evening newscast with Howard K. Smith, who remained as co-anchor after Harry Reasoner was hired from CBS to replace Reynolds in December 1970. After the demotion, Reynolds returned to the field as a correspondent for the network. After Reasoner and Barbara Walters ceased their anchor duties in 1978, Reynolds returned to the anchor chair as the Washington, D.C., anchor for the now-revamped World News Tonight newscast, with co-anchors Max Robinson and Peter Jennings. Reynolds was also the original anchor of \\"America Held Hostage\\", a series of special reports seen weeknights at 11:30 p.m. (10:30 p.m. Central Time) on the Iran hostage crisis in November 1979 that evolved into the newsmagazine Nightline in March 1980. Reynolds, still an evening news anchor, soon tired of the grind of the extended hours and was replaced by one of his revolving substitutes, Ted Koppel, then the network's chief diplomatic correspondent. === Reagan assassination attempt coverage episode, 1981 === One famous moment in Reynolds' career occurred on March 30, 1981, during live news coverage of the assassination attempt on President Ronald Reagan. Early reports received by his newsroom had indicated that press secretary James Brady and others had been shot, but that Reagan was uninjured. He became upset when a report arrived indicating that Reagan had been struck and at one point can be heard shouting at an individual off-screen to \\"Speak up!\\" as more information arrived. Later, Brady, a close friend of Reynolds, was erroneously reported by all three networks as having died from the head wound he suffered in the incident.It is often erroneously cited that Reynolds was told that Reagan had died. Upon learning that the information regarding Brady was incorrect, Reynolds suddenly appeared noticeably upset and, looking around at staffers in the background, angrily burst out: > \\"Let's get it nailed down ... somebody ... let's find out! Let's get it > straight so we can report this thing accurately!\\" === Death === Reynolds was diagnosed with multiple myeloma in early 1983 and had been absent from his anchor position since April of that year. He died three months later, on July 20, at the age of 59; his death was attributed to acute viral hepatitis.name=nytobit83 ==Legacy== Grave at Arlington National Cemetery One of Reynolds' five sons is WGN America News Nation correspondent Dean Reynolds. Coincidentally, it was a report from the younger Reynolds while he was a correspondent for UPI which first revealed that James Brady was still alive, leading to the aforementioned outburst from the elder Reynolds. Reynolds is also famous for his optimistic prediction during a live broadcast of the solar eclipse of February 26, 1979, where he stated, “Not until Aug. 21, 2017, will another eclipse be visible from North America, that’s 38 years from now. May the shadow of the moon fall on a world at peace.” Reynolds' last broadcast was April 20, 1983, and, despite promises of his return by substitute anchormen, he never did, dying from hepatitis-induced liver failure at Sibley Memorial Hospital on July 20, 1983, at the age of 59. He was diagnosed with multiple myeloma while he was being treated for acute hepatitis. Reynolds had injured his upper left femur in the Florida surf in January while on vacation and fell on it after slipping on ice in a mid- February snowstorm.

Reynolds, an Army veteran wounded in combat, is interred in Arlington National Cemetery in Virginia. President Reagan and wife Nancy were among the 1,100 at the funeral at St. Matthew's Cathedral in Washington. Pope John Paul II sent condolences to the family by a letter from the Vatican, read by Bishop Edward John Herrmann. In 1985, Reynolds was posthumously awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Reagan on May 23. A few years after Reynolds' death, musician Paul Hardcastle recorded a section of an ABC documentary about the Vietnam War, that included narration by Reynolds, and later used it as part of his 1985 U.S. Top 40 and U.K. #1 (5 weeks) hit, 19. Hardcastle had a video made of the song that included footage from that documentary that ABC later demanded be removed. The ABC footage was later replaced with stock footage, but Reynolds' voice remained on the recording. ==References== ==External links== * Category:1923 births Category:1983 deaths Category:20th-century American journalists Category:American army personnel of World War II Category:American Roman Catholics Category:American television news anchors Category:ABC News personalities Category:Burials at Arlington National Cemetery Category:Television anchors from Chicago Category:Deaths from bone cancer Category:Deaths from multiple myeloma Category:Deaths from cancer in Washington, D.C.

Further, SOLAS seeks to link ocean-atmosphere interactions with climate and people. Achievements of these goals are essential in order to understand and quantify the role that ocean-atmosphere interactions play in the regulation of climate and global change. SOLAS was first initiated with an Open Science Conference in 2000 and was formally launched in 2004. Since then, the SOLAS community has grown into a worldwide network with 1075 members and 30 national networks around the world. Development and implementation of the SOLAS science plan is guided by a scientific steering committee (SSC) composed of international experts covering a broad spectrum of disciplines, including atmospheric chemistry, oceanography, marine biology, and legal sciences. SOLAS science is currently organised around five core research themes, namely: 1) Greenhouse gases and the oceans; 2) Air-sea interface and fluxes of mass and energy; 3) Atmospheric deposition and ocean biogeochemistry; 4) Interconnections between aerosols, clouds, and marine ecosystems; and 5) Ocean biogeochemical control on atmospheric chemistry. The five SOLAS core research themes are complemented by cross-cutting themes on key environments (such as upwelling systems, polar oceans, and the Indian Ocean), as well as on evaluating the environmental efficacy and impacts of climate intervention proposals, policy decisions, and societal developments. Since 2000, SOLAS has organised seven international Open Science Conferences and seven Summer Schools tailored to students and early career earth scientists. In addition, to these large-scale events, SOLAS also organises meetings, workshops, and conference sessions related to SOLAS science. The SOLAS project is coordinated by an International Project Office (IPO), which is currently hosted by GEOMAR Helmholtz Centre for Ocean Research Kiel, Germany, in association to the research unit chemical oceanography, with a nodal office hosted by the State Key Laboratory of marine Environmental Science at Xiamen University, China.

It is operated by the Bexar/Medina/Atascosa County Agricultural District. Medina Dam was completed in 1913 in a privately financed project, creating the lake to supply irrigation water for local agricultural use. Lake Medina is in northeastern Medina County, and southeastern Bandera County, about 40 miles (64 km) northwest of San Antonio. It is a crescent-shaped reservoir running west to east. It is 18 miles (29 km) long and 3 miles (5 km) wide at its broadest point. It is contained by the Medina Dam at the lake's south end. At the time of the dam's construction, it was the largest concrete dam in the country and the fourth largest dam overall. The dam is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The lake is fed by and discharges back into the Medina River, and serves both recreational and irrigation uses. Communities located along the lake are Mico, Lake Medina Shores and Lakehills. There is also a Lake Medina east of Medina, Ohio, which recently was made a county park. ==Fish populations== Medina Lake has been stocked with species of fish intended to improve the reservoir for recreational fishing. Fish in Medina Lake include largemouth bass, white bass, hybrid striped bass, catfish, and carp. Due to drought conditions lasting up until July 2015, recreational fish species had disappeared. Plans to restock the lake once levels reach viable levels were put in place. These plans were realized when the lake did reach these levels, which as of October 2, 2016, is 96.6% full.https://waterdatafortexas.org/reservoirs/individual/medina ==Future and state of the lake== As part of the 2010–13 Southern United States drought, the lake water levels dropped below 5% capacity. Many cracks, oil drums and a Jeep are visible as a result of low water. Only one public boat ramp remains, located at Red Cove in Mico. A few showers in the Summer of 2013 helped the lake rise to 5.2%, but the dam was reopened in September as many people in the South Side of San Antonio use the lake for a water source. Many businesses have closed in the area, many residents have left and Lakehills has become somewhat of a ghost town. Heavy rainfall in the region as of May, 2015 brought the levels above 46% capacity. At that time, Medina Lake was about 28 feet low, down from 90 feet low mere months before. Due to heavy rains on the Medina River basin & the lake itself in May 2016, Medina Lake is 100% full and 1.5 feet above its conservation pool as of June 1, 2016. ==References== Category:Reservoirs in Texas Category:Bodies of water of Bandera County, Texas Category:Bodies of water of Medina County, Texas ","title":"Medina Lake"},{"id":"1282111","text":"Cecil Donald Briscoe (March 20, 1940 – October 31, 2004) was an American stage and soap opera actor known for starring in the TV series Dark Shadows. == Early life and education == He was born on March 20, 1940 in Scobey, Mississippi.

Fronted by chief songwriter and lead vocalist Sean Bonniwell, the band cultivated a characteristically dark and rebellious image reflected in an untamed musical approach. Sometimes it made use of distorted guitar lines and hallucinogenic organ parts, punctuated by Bonniwell's distinctively throaty vocals. Although they managed to attain national chart success only briefly with two singles, the Music Machine is today considered by many critics to be one of the groundbreaking acts of the 1960s. Their style is now recognized as a pioneering force in proto-punk; yet within a relatively short period of time, they began to employ more complex lyrical and instrumental arrangements that went beyond the typical garage band format. In 1965, the band came together as a folk rock trio known as the Raggamuffins, before expanding to the quintet that was later rechristened the Music Machine. The group was known for their style of dress, clothing themselves in all-black attire. In 1966, the Music Machine was signed to Original Sound, and released its first single \\"Talk Talk\\" in the latter half of the year, with it reaching the Top 20 of the Billboard Hot 100. Their debut album (Turn On) The Music Machine and the moderate hit \\"The People in Me\\" followed. The band's original lineup fragmented in late 1967 after managerial and financial disputes. Bonniwell reassembled the group under the name The Bonniwell Music Machine. In 1968, a second album, The Bonniwell Music Machine appeared, but the group disbanded in early 1969. ==History== ===Beginnings (1965–1966)=== The nucleus of the band was formed when Sean Bonniwell (lead vocals, rhythm guitar) took part in a jam session with Keith Olsen (bass guitar) and Ron Edgar (drums; born Ronald Edgar on June 25, 1946 in Minneapolis, Minnesota) – both of whom he met in the folk music circuit. Bonniwell, already a practiced \\"folky,\\" possessed prior experience as a vocalist with the Wayfarers. The traditional folk combo had already enjoyed some regional success: releasing three albums, and building on the experience of Bonniwell who insisted on the importance of rehearsal. As Bonniwell traveled and recorded with the group, he began penning some material that would later surface with the Music Machine. However, still influenced by acts now considered passé, the Wayfarers' musical conservatism became stifling to Bonniwell who wanted to explore the type of harder, cutting-edge stylistic possibilities that he eventually would find in rock. Prior to meeting, Olsen had previously performed in Gale Garnett's backing band, and Edgar was a member of a bohemian folk quintet called the GoldeBriars. With the GoldeBriars, Edgar contributed to their unreleased third album that was originally intended for distribution on Epic Records, but the group disbanded before it could be released. In 1965, the three formed their own folk rock group, the Raggamuffins, and began performing in Los Angeles with a repertoire that saw the band embrace a more unorthodox style, and depart from their traditional roots. The group also recorded four songs that went unreleased until the 2000 album, Ignition, which represented the transitional phase before the band developed into the Music Machine. Bonniwell and Olsen were enthusiastically experimenting with musical textures while the band arranged strict rehearsal regimens in Bonniwell's garage. The Raggamuffins purchased hardware for a homemade fuzz-tone switch. From the onset Bonniwell ensured the group resonated like no other by instructing his bandmates to lower their instruments from the standard E note to D-flat. As a result of the adjustment, the Raggamuffins were given a bottom-heavy and ominous sound. In addition, the group began dressing noire, while sporting dyed-black hair, and the trademark single leather glove that presented an eye-catching and unified band image, which would later become influential with certain 1970s punk acts. Auditions were held in early 1966 to expand the group, resulting in the recruitment of Mark Landon (lead guitar) and Doug Rhodes (organ), previously a session musician for the Association. To reflect on the revamped line-up, Bonniwell changed the band's name to the Music Machine. Another purpose for coining the name, Bonniwell explained, was \\"I seguewayed [sic] all the original material with musical segueways [sic]. So we would be on stage for like an hour and ten minutes, wall-to-wall music just nonstop, which is why I called us the Music Machine\\". The band built a name for itself with its performances in local clubs in Los Angeles. With Bonniwell as the de facto leader and creative force of the band, the Music Machine began to develop a blend of gritty 60s punk and psychedelia, and a repertoire encompassing Bonniwell's self-penned material along with some cover songs. The band's sound was highlighted by the authoritative and versatile vocals provided by Bonniwell, with an energized technique that juxtaposed the styles of Mick Jagger and Sky Saxon. Unlike these two contemporaries, Bonniwell possessed unusually good intonation in long-sustained passages, and the ability to breakdown phrases into a series of slow pulsations. The Music Machine's artistic stance was also highlighted by Landon's wiry guitar playing, Olsen's reverberant bass, and Edgar's cymbal- punctuated drumming, which gave the band a harder-edged sound than many of their contemporaries. ===Commercial success (1966–1967)=== Record producer Brian Ross just happened upon the Music Machine at Hollywood Legion Lanes, a bowling alley that was an early stomping ground for the group, and signed them to a recording contract with Original Sound. On July 30, 1966, the band entered RCA Studios in Los Angeles to record the Bonniwell originals \\"Talk Talk\\" and \\"Come on In\\", which was initially going to be the A-side for the group's debut single. Bonniwell had composed \\"Talk Talk\\" a year prior to forming the band, and the studio time was marked by the Music Machine's collective input aimed toward tightening the structure of its arrangements, including the two-note fuzz guitar riffs and Edgar's precise drumming technique. By virtue of the group's dedication to rehearsal, recording sessions concluded with the Music Machine requiring only three takes to complete the two songs. Though the band was satisfied with the acetate to \\"Come on In\\", the members were convinced \\"Talk Talk\\" would propel them into the national charts. \\"Talk Talk\\" was released on September 10, 1966, on Original Sound, and rose to number 15 on the Billboard Hot 100. It also peaked at number 21 on Cashbox and number 18 on Record World. The song's relatively short time-length—a mere one minute and 56 seconds—made \\"Talk Talk\\" a favorable staple on Top 40 radio and its competing underground FM stations. The Music Machine's hit was arguably the most radical single to appear on mainstream broadcasting in 1966, the phenomenon described by music historian Richie Unterberger as a \\"rally cry to social alienation with a mixture of sarcasm, rebellion, self-pity, and paranoia\\". Indeed, Bonniwell's progressive lyrics and arrangements have been credited with influencing the Doors and Iron Butterfly, as well as future punk bands. After the single's release, the Music Machine embarked on a grueling three-month tour across the U.S., packaged with the Beach Boys, Question Mark and the Mysterians, and Clyde McPhatter. It concluded with the group receiving a poor response from the more conservative southern crowds, who criticized the band's black outfits. Nonetheless, for the most part, their unified image served well for the Music Machine's national recognition, especially as the group made numerous appearances on the television programs Where the Action Is, American Bandstand, and Shindig!. After their long national tour, the Music Machine returned to the studio to record their debut album, (Turn On) The Music Machine. Much to the disapproval of Bonniwell, his original material had to compete with dispensable cover versions of \\"Cherry, Cherry\\", \\"Taxman\\", \\"See See Rider\\", and \\"96 Tears\\", all chosen by their record label with an expectation that the well-known songs would increase record sales. One interpretation voluntarily selected by the band was a slow, moody, fuzz-laden arrangement of \\"Hey Joe\\" which bears a strong resemblance to Jimi Hendrix's later version. Bonniwell first heard the folk standard in 1962 at a club in Hermosa Beach, and was convinced the tune's tempo was too fast, as he unsuccessfully attempted to persuade the Wayfarers to record a slower version. He revisited the concept with altered lyrics after hearing Tim Rose's regionally successful rendition in early 1966. The throaty vocals, most evidently on \\"Hey Joe\\", Bonniwell blames on recording \\"the Turn On album after a 30-day tour. Mark's fingers were literally bleeding. I could hardly even speak, much less sing\\". Despite the album's shortcomings, (Turn On) The Music Machine managed to reach number 75 on the Billboard 200. On January 21, 1967, a song taken from the album, \\"The People in Me\\", was issued as the group's second single but stalled at number 66 nationally after the band's management angered radio executives for initially making the song exclusively available to a rival station. ===The Bonniwell Music Machine (1967–1969)=== Immediately after (Turn On) The Music Machine was released, the band left for another U.S. tour, despite pleas by the group to arrange an appearance at the Monterey Pop Festival. In the small off-periods in their hard-pressed schedule, the Music Machine demoed a new batch of Bonniwell originals at RCA Studios in New York City and Cosimo Matassa's facility in New Orleans, before polishing the tunes back in Los Angeles. From the sessions emerged the group's third single \\"Double Yellow Line\\", which was released in April 1967, and bubbled under the Billboard Hot 100 at number 111. The subsequent release, \\"Eagle Never Hunts the Fly\\" failed to chart, but is often described as Bonniwell's tour de force—a tune Ross praised as \\"sonically compelling works and a lot to listen to, for the time. It was the kind of thing you just didn’t hear, you almost worried about getting those sounds onto a 45\\". In May 1967, the original lineup recorded together for the final time, completing \\"Astrologically Incompatible\\", \\"Talk Me Down\\", and \\"The Day Today\\". One problem that led to the band's first breakup was the Music Machine name was actually owned by Ross, as a part of their production deal, awarding the group little to no royalties. Leaving Bonniwell to carry on the project, Olsen, Edgar, and Rhodes went on to join the Millennium, a sunshine pop group conceived by singer-songwriter Curt Boettcher and Olsen. The Millennium recorded the album Begin in 1968 before disbanding. The three former members also took part in Boettcher's next production, the studio group Sagittarius, releasing Present Tense, coupled with the moderately successful single \\"My World Fell Down\\", before Edgar and Rhodes departed. Olsen stayed on board to record Sagittarius' second album, The Blue Marble, and subsequently forged a successful career as a record producer in the 1970s. Undeterred, Bonniwell successfully negotiated his recording contract with Original Sound be transferred to Warner Bros. Records, in hopes of finding a greater degree of independence. The Music Machine's spell with Original Sound was drawing to a conclusion, though the company did release \\"Hey Joe\\" as a single in 1968 in an attempt to cash in on Hendrix's success with the song. There was also the Bonniwell solo project in association with producer Paul Buff that resulted in the rare \\"Nothing Is Too Good for My Car\\" single being put out under the name the Friendly Torpedoes. Writer Greg Russo, who composed the liner notes for the single's remastered release, explains the side-project was initiated during a confusing transitional phase for Bonniwell that also generated the tune \\"Citizen Fear\\", which did not receive distribution until the Ignition album in 2000. Free from company pressure, Bonniwell formed a new band, rechristened The Bonniwell Music Machine, with session musicians Ed Jones on bass guitar, Harry Garfield on organ, Alan Wisdom on lead guitar, and Jerry Harris on drums. In March 1967, Bonniwell and Ross ushered in the new lineup at United Western Recorders to record the second album The Bonniwell Music Machine. The recording and mixing process was painstakingly masterminded almost solely by Bonniwell, who was appreciative of his new bandmates' efforts to develop the album's concept, but disillusioned by the project's lack of cohesion. He further explains that the \\"Warner Brothers album has such an eclectic approach; each track is (was) a singular, studio invention. Not only was my songwriting divergent, but my approach to recording was exploratory as well\\". Six of the album's tracks were holdovers from the first lineup's sessions at Cosimo Matassa's studio and RCA Studios. This resulted in a hodgepodge of musical styles, including exploratory approaches toward psychedelia and soft rock. On February 10, 1968, The Bonniwell Music Machine was released with little commercial success. Consequently, the Bonniwell Music Machine was largely forgotten by the general public and the second lineup fragmented in July 1968. ===Disbandment and aftermath=== One final version of the Bonniwell Music Machine was assembled with a revolving door of musicians. Two more singles were released on the Warner Bros. label with little notice, before \\"Advice and Consent\\", the group's final single, was distributed on Bell Records in March 1969. Disenchanted by the music industry and having to tour against imitation Music Machine groups, Bonniwell gave up the rights to the band's name and signed on to Capitol Records as a solo artist. Under the name T.S. Bonniwell, he recorded the album Close, which saw a poetically-inclined Bonniwell explore string and orchestral arrangements. Following the album's release, Bonniwell departed on what he called his \\"westernized guru era\\"—studying eastern mysticism and practicing meditation and vegetarianism. The band was all but forgotten after their dissolution, but the Music Machine and their music experienced a revival of interest in the late-1980s. It began with Rhino Records featuring tracks on the Nuggets compilation albums Nuggets Volume 1: The Hits and Nuggets, Volume 2: Punk, before releasing the album The Best of the Music Machine in 1984. Other compilations such as Beyond the Garage, The Very Best of the Music Machine, and Ignition have added to the Music Machine's return to the public's interest. In addition, \\"Talk Talk\\" and \\"Double Yellow Line\\" appear on the 1998 expanded box-set of Nuggets: Original Artyfacts from the First Psychedelic Era, 1965–1968. In 2000, Bonniwell published his autobiography Beyond the Garage, which recalled his experiences with the Music Machine and his life after the group's disbandment. Aside from a few live performances with the Larksmen and a guest appearance on their 2006 album, Bonniwell never returned to an active music career, though he claimed to have penned over 300 songs after his tenure with the Music Machine. On December 20, 2011, Bonniwell died of lung cancer at a medical center in Visalia, California; he was 71 years old. Drummer Ronald \\"Ron\\" Edgar died on February 23, 2015 at the age of 68. Bass guitarist Keith Olsen died on March 9, 2020, at age 74. == Discography == === Studio albums === * (Turn On) The Music Machine (1966) * The Bonniwell Music Machine (1968) === Extended plays === * Talk Talk (1967) === Compilation albums === * The Best of the Music Machine (1984) * The Music Machine (1994) * Beyond the Garage (1995) * Rock 'n' Roll Hits (1997) * Turn On: The Best of the Music Machine (1999) * Ignition (2000) * The Ultimate Turn On (2006) * Rarities, Vol. 1: Last Singles & Demos (2014) * Rarities, Vol. 2: Early Mixes & Rehearsals (2014) * Re- Ignition (2015) === Singles === * \\"Talk Talk\\" b/w \\"Come on In\\" (1966) * \\"The People in Me\\" b/w \\"Masculine Intuition\\" (1967) * \\"Double Yellow Line\\" b/w \\"Absolutely Positively\\" (1967) * \\"The Eagle Never Hunts the Fly\\" b/w \\"I've Loved You\\" (1967) * \\"Hey Joe\\" b/w \\"Taxman\\" (1967) * \\"Advise and Consent\\" b/w \\"Mother Nature, Father Earth\\" (1969) ==== As The Bonniwell Music Machine ==== * \\"Bottom of the Soul\\" b/w \\"Astrologically Incompatible\\" (1967) * \\"Me, Myself and I\\" b/w \\"Soul Love\\" (1968) * \\"Tin Can Beach\\" b/w \\"Time Out for a Daydream\\" (1968) * \\"You'll Love Me Again\\" b/w \\"To the Light\\" (1968) * \\"Point of No Return\\" b/w \\"King Mixer\\" (1997) ==== Other ==== * \\"Nothing's Too Good for My Car\\" b/w \\"So Long Ago\\" (1968, as the Friendly Torpedos) ==References== Category:Acid rock music groups Category:Bell Records artists Category:Original Sound artists Category:Garage rock groups from California Category:Musical groups established in 1965 Category:Musical groups disestablished in 1969 Category:Musical groups from Los Angeles Category:Protopunk groups Category:Psychedelic rock music groups from California Category:Rock music groups from California ","title":"The Music Machine"},{"id":"1282153","text":"The Ministry of Justice of Cameroon is the Department responsible for administering the Cameroon justice system. As of May 2004, the Minister of State for Justice was Amadou Ali. The legal system in the Cameroon is complex with a constitution developed in 1972 and revised in 1996 as well as elements of the Code Napoleon, Common Law and customary law. In early 2005, the Ministry of Justice became responsible for administering the prison system due to unrest in the prisons. The Ministry of Justice also has a shared responsibility for administering human rights in the Cameroon. There have been serious allegations about use of torture by police and military officials in the Cameroon. ==Administration of justice== The constitution of the Cameroon provides that the Supreme Court of Cameroon is the highest court existing in the country. In addition, the country has appeal courts, circuit courts and magistrates courts. The Supreme Court is located in Yaoundé as is the Cameroon High Court of Justice consisting of nine titular judges and six surrogate judges and The Constitutional Council of Cameroon, consisting of eleven Judges with three nominated by the President of Cameroon, three nominated by the President of the Senate,three others nominated by the Speaker of the National Assembly and two by the Higher Judicial Council. All of these nominations are forwarded to the President of the republic who appoints them by decree. Other courts are located throughout the country. The constitution provides for a Constitutional Council responsible for ensuring the Constitutionality of laws. The Supreme Court carried out this duty before its creation in 2018. Cameroon claims that the judiciary is independent from the executive and the legislature. However, the US State Department claims that the judiciary is subordinate to the Ministry of Justice and that the Supreme Court can only consider a constitutional matter when referred to it by the President of Cameroon, 1/3 of the Members of the Cameroonian National Assembly or 1/3 of the Members of the Senate of Cameroon. The Supreme Court is responsible for adjudicating disputes between the president and the National Assembly. The President of the Cameroon in his capacity as President of the Higher Judicial Council of Cameroon is responsible for appointing judges and also has the power to dismiss them. The Higher Judicial Council of Cameroon advises him on the nomination of judges and magistrates and has responsibility for judicial discipline. The Parliamentary Court of Justice is responsible for judging acts by the President in cases where he or she has been accused of high treason. This Court also has responsibility for judging acts by the Prime Minister of the Cameroon, other members of the Government and other senior officials in cases relevant to state security. ==Legal traditions== Prior to independence, jurisdiction over Cameroon was shared between the United Kingdom and France under a League of Nations mandate issued in 1919. The northern part of the British area became part of Nigeria while the Christian southern part joined with the French area. As a consequence, the country inherited a dual legal system including parts of the Code Napoleon and the common law. However, on 12 July 2005 the National Assembly (Assemblé Nationale) approved a law to harmonize the country's criminal procedure code. In addition, traditional courts still play a significant role in domestic, property and probate. The court system honours tribal laws and customs when these do not conflict with national laws. ==Prison system== The Ministry of Justice became responsible for administering the prison system at the beginning of 2005 taking over responsibility from the Ministry of Territorial Administration of Cameroon. This follows disturbances caused by overcrowding of prisons and long stays in detention without charges of prisons. There were 15,903 people in the prison system as of 1997 representing 115 per 100,000 population. However, the population of the prisons has grown rapidly in recent years. The New Bell prison in Douala was meant to hold 800 inmates but holds 3,100. The International Centre for Prison Studies estimates that Cameroon has the second highest occupancy rate in the world after Barbados with approximately half awaiting trial. The Government has built two new prisons but has not provided enough staff resulting in the establishment of \\"anti-gangs\\" of inmates to preserve order. ==Human rights== The preamble of the constitution adopted in 1996 incorporates parts of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights. The Ministry of Justice shares responsibility for administering human rights with the Ministry of Territorial Administration. A person who considers that their rights may have been violated may take their case either to the statutory courts or to the traditional courts. They may also petition the National Committee on Human Rights and Freedoms established in 1990. They may also seek compensation through the courts. If a person is acquitted, discharged or has been wrongfully held in custody, they are not entitled to compensation unless they can prove that the judge was wrong or the system did not function properly. The United Nations Commission on Human Rights held hearings in 2003 into allegations of torture by the police and the military. The major area of concern was the prison network although it has been acknowledged that Cameroon had made some progress in improving its human rights performance. ==List of ministers== * Charles Okala (1959) * Victor Kanga (1960) * Mohaman Lamine (1960-1961) * Njoya Arouna (1961-1964) * Sanda Oumarou (1966-1970) * Félix Sabal Lecco (1970-1972) * Simon Achidi Achu (1972-1975) * Joseph Charles Doumba (1975-1979) * Gilbert Andze Tchoungui (1979-1983) * André Ngongang Ouandji (1983-1985) * Benjamin Itoe (1985-1989) *Adolphe Moudiki (1989-1991) *Douala Moutome (1991-1996) * Laurent Esso (1996-2000) *Robert Mbella Mbappe (2000-2001) * Amadou Ali (2001-2011) * Laurent Esso (2011- present) ==References== * The Statesman’s Yearbook 2005 Palgrave Macmillan London.

Situated west of Highway 400 and east of Highway 50, north of Steeles Avenue, and generally south of Major Mackenzie Drive West. It was once an independent town before being amalgamated with nearby communities to form the city in 1971. Its traditional downtown core is the Woodbridge Avenue stretch between Islington Avenue and Kipling Avenue north of Highway 407. ==History== Humber River. Also visible is the Toronto Grey and Bruce Railway. Hay Baler rental. Due to the cost of farm equipment, most of it was rented out by a single owner who employed a team of workers that would come and work the equipment for any clients. Highway 27 and Langstaff Road The community had its origins with the British Crown granting the west half of lots six and seven, concession 7 of Vaughan Township to Jacob Philips and Hugh Cameron in 1802.City of Vaughan Archives, http://www.city.vaughan.on.ca/tourism/history/woodbridge.cfm Accessed 4 January 2008 During the early half the 19th century, a school was built on Vaughan's eighth concession; and a flour mill and store flourished at Pine Grove, which is among the oldest areas of the city. A scattering of houses arose around Smith's mill (presently Hayhoe Mills on Pine Grove). Smith's mill later became known as Smithsville, but was eventually incorporated into the town of Woodbridge. A similar settlement, known as Brownsville, came into being around a mill run by John Brown on the Humber River on what is today Wallace Street in today's downtown Woodbridge business section. Woodbridge proper, however, did not begin to take the form of a settlement or village until the arrival of Rowland Burr in 1837. The settlement's name was changed to Woodbridge in 1855 because there was already a settlement named Burrwick. The name was taken from the wooden bridge that crossed the Humber River as an entry point into town. The historic bridge was located close to what is today Islington Avenue and Langstaff Road, on Langstaff looking north. A replica bridge circa 1930 made out of concrete remains close to the original bridge location and is accessible from Boyd Park and to a city maintenance facility. The bridge has been rebuilt as of 2016 and instead of being wooden, it is now made of steel. A major industry over time, Abell Agricultural Works opened in 1862 and had 200 employees by 1874, making steam-powered agriculture equipment. The Toronto, Grey and Bruce Railway arrived from Weston in 1870. This line was constructed as a narrow gauge railway through Caledon and completed to Owen Sound in 1873. Owing to financial difficulty, it was operated by the Grand Trunk Railway until 1883, when it was leased to the Canadian Pacific Railway. Conversion to standard gauge required realigning some of the track curves, particularly around Woodbridge. In 1908 this line was linked to the transcontinental route through Sudbury, while the original route between Bolton and Orangeville, was abandoned in 1934. By 1880, the settlement had two general stores, a carriage works, two churches, a school, two hotels, a library, two newspaper and a post office. By 1882, Woodbridge had over a thousand residents and was incorporated as a village. Woodbridge was also served by a branch of the Toronto Suburban Railway until the 1930s. The radial railway from Weston came in along the west side of the river, north of Humber Summit, after descending from its route along Albion Road and Kipling Avenue. Construction of Highway 7 began in the 1920s, passing south of the business section and through an underpass of the Canadian Pacific. The original railway bridge spanned the valley of the Humber River, while construction of Highway 407 has undermined the banks of the river on both sides, requiring a third overpass for the railway. As Woodbridge is on the Humber floodplain, Hurricane Hazel in 1954 devastated the community as the river swelled from its usual width of at its narrowest point to , and left hundreds homeless and nine dead.http://www.hurricanehazel.ca/ssi/about_community.shtml During much of this time, the land surrounding much of Woodbridge was used for farming. Slowly the area became populated with custom country houses. In the 1950s, Woodbridge experienced growth from suburban Toronto houses. Many Italians that settled in Downtown Toronto, such as in Little Italy, moved to the suburbs, in particular Woodbridge. The suburban expansion began east of the Humber and East Humber and to the northeast. Prior to the expansion, the urban area was up to Kipling Avenue and to the Humber. It later expanded in the west up to Martin Grove Road with a north to south width of about 800 m in the 1960s and to the north and portions of the northeast of Langstaff Road. It later expanded north in the 1970s and the 1980s. A drive-in theatre was situated at Highway 27 and Langstaff near Martin Grove Road. Operating from 1967 to 1997, it was torn down in 1998 for residential houses. The housing developments in the west expanded north to Langstaff and in the central part of Woodbridge including a part that transformed older stores into smaller units of housing in the early-1980s and west to Highway 27 in the late-1980s and in 1992. The houses expanded north to 400 m south of Rutherford Road in the 1980s and east up to Weston Road from Highway 7 to 400 m south of Rutherford Road and south to 200 m north of the present-day Highway 407. The Industrial areas began appearing first to the west and then to the southwest and to the east. The housing developments in mid-1990s expanded Martin Grove Road northward. Woodbridge Highlands was formed in the northwest, east of Highway 27 in the 1990s. In 1994 housing developments reached to Rutherford and continued until 1996 except for the northeast and the southeastern part. The condominiums began construction and now appear between Woodbridge Avenue and the Humber. Sonoma Heights at Islington and Rutherford and the Vellore area at Weston and Rutherford have been developed. The Vellore area includes Vellore Village developed by builders such as Greenpark Homes, Aspen Ridge Homes and Remington Homes. The Vellore Woods area was developed by Arista Homes and Fieldgate Homes. Development in the west end of Woodbridge then followed with Weston Rd and Rutherford becoming a major focal point for the building of additional residential units stretching north to Major Mackenzie. Land on both sides of Weston Road to Major Mackenzie were completely filled in. Woodbridge Avenue between Islington Avenue and Kipling Avenue was once home to some of the historical buildings from the late 19th century in addition to newer 1920s-1960s buildings, but is rapidly being reconstructed. Two examples of a historic buildings include a Tinsmith Shop and Masonic Lodge (circa 1850) and the Burwick family home (from 1844 on Pine Street) that were moved to Black Creek Pioneer Village.Black Creek Pioneer Village Buildings, Accessed 16 January 2010 Market Lane remains the commercial hub of this area, with several other shops and stores lining Woodbridge Avenue. Woodbridge was chosen as the new location for a research based mental health facility, the OCD and Anxiety Clinic of Ontario. First of its kind, it offers specialized psychological care by offering case by case care, as opposed to a volume patient care model. An F2 tornado tore through the city of Vaughan during the Southern Ontario Tornado Outbreak on August 20, 2009. The tornado also ripped up trees, flipped cars, and left thousands of people without power. No one was killed. ==Geography== Situated in hilly terrain of the Humber River Valley, historic Woodbridge rests at an average elevation of 200 metres between Highway 27 and Pine Valley Drive. The terrain can be described as a series of rolling hills and valleys. There are numerous valley intersections that demonstrate the geography of the area, notably Highway 7 and Islington and Highway 27 and Rutherford. The area was mainly farmland before the onset of suburbanization in the 1970s, but the residential communities are interspersed with forests along the Humber River and its eastern branch. Today, much of the area is residential with commercial and industrial properties to the south, close to Steeles Avenue and to the east near Pine Valley Drive. Looking east along Highway 7 in the Humber River Valley near Islington Ave. The area commonly considered to be Woodbridge today covers a very large portion (roughly one- third) of Vaughan, and is usually seen as being bounded by Highway 50 or Highway 27 to the west, Steeles Avenue to the south, Highway 400 to the east, and Major Mackenzie Drive to the north.http://www.elections.ca/res/cir/maps2/mapprov.asp?map=35111 ===Climate=== Woodbridge has a humid continental climate (Köppen climate classification Dfb), with warm, humid summers and cold, snowy winters. Woodbridge winters feature cold snaps where maximum temperatures remain below −10 °C (14 °F), often made to feel colder by wind chill. Accumulating snow can fall any time from October until April. Summer in Woodbridge is characterized by long stretches of humid weather. Spring and autumn are transitional seasons, with generally mild or cool temperatures and alternating dry and wet periods.

He was known for playing Captain Peacock in Are You Being Served? and its sequel Grace & Favour (Are You Being Served? Again!) and as Herbert \\"Truly\\" Truelove in Last of the Summer Wine. ==Early life== Frank Thornton Ball was born in Dulwich, London, the son of Rosina Mary (née Thornton) and William Ernest Ball. His father was an organist at St Stephen's Church, Sydenham Hill,St. Stephen Parish Magazine, Dulwich, London where Frank learned to play the organ for a short while. Music proved too difficult for him, however, and he wanted to act from an early age. His father, who worked in a bank, wanted him to get a \\"proper\\" job, so he began working in insurance after leaving Alleyn's School. He soon enrolled at a small acting school, the London School of Dramatic Art, and took evening classes. After two years working at the insurance company he was invited to become a day student at the acting school and persuaded his father to finance his studies. During the Second World War, Thornton was evacuated along with the drama school, and his first job was touring with four plays in Ireland, beginning in County Tipperary. After that he served as an airman in the Royal Air Force before ending the war as an officer. From the rank of leading aircraftman he was commissioned as a pilot officer on probation (emergency) on 1 December 1944. On 1 June 1945 his commission was confirmed and he was promoted to flying officer (war substantive). He was demobilised in 1947. ==Marriage== On 5 June 1945, Thornton married actress Beryl Evans in West Wickham; the couple had a daughter, Jane. ==Career== Almost immediately after demobilisation, Thornton joined a repertory company. He appeared in the farce The Party Spirit in the West End alongside Robertson Hare and Ralph Lynn. His first credited screen role was in the film Radio Cab Murder (1954).

In addition, a number of other areas of the world are known for the use of Celtic musical styles and techniques, including Newfoundland, and much of the folk music of Canada's Maritimes, especially on Cape Breton Island and Prince Edward Island. ==Newfoundland== There are very strong connections between Newfoundland folk music and Irish music, however elements of English folk music and French-Canadian and Acadian music can be heard within the style. A very traditional strain of Irish music exists in Newfoundland, especially in the primarily Irish-Catholic communities along the southern shore. The instrumentation in Newfoundland music includes the button accordion, guitar, violin, tin whistle and more recently the bodhrán. Many Newfoundland traditional bands also include bass guitar and drum kit. Other folk instruments such as the mandolin and bouzouki are common especially among Newfoundland bands with an Irish leaning. Because Newfoundland is an island in the North Atlantic, many of the songs focus on the fishery and seafaring. Many songs chronicle the history of this unique people. Instrumental tune styles include jigs, reels, two steps, and polkas. ===Newfoundland musicians and musical groups=== *Fiddle players: Rufus Guinchard, Kelly Russell, Émile Benoît and Patrick Moran *Button accordion players: Minnie White and Harry Hibbs *Bodhran players: Fergus O'Byrne and Paddy Mackey *Popular Newfoundland traditional music group: Irish Descendants, Great Big Sea, The Rolling Kings, The Punters, Shanneyganock, Connemara, The Masterless Men, Kevin Collins, and Greeley's Reel. *Irish music band in Newfoundland: Ryan's Fancy ==Nova Scotia and Cape Breton Island== Cape Breton is internationally known for unusual styles of Cape Breton fiddling, which is derived from Scottish techniques. The island has produced traditional music-based popular performers like John Allan Cameron, The Rankin Family, Natalie MacMaster, Buddy MacMaster, The Barra MacNeils, Rita MacNeil, Ashley MacIsaac and others. In addition to the fiddle music, there is a parallel style of solo dance bagpiping and a rhythmic syncopated Celtic piano style. Recently, Highland style guitar has received some attention due to the work of Dave MacIsaac and Scott MacMillan among others. Mary Jane Lamond has attracted attention to the Island's Gaelic song traditions of Milling Frolics (waulking songs in Scotland), Piurt à Beul (mouth music), spinning songs and more. Irish traditional music is also very popular on the island, particularly Irish folk songs. This is especially prevalent in the communities around North Sydney and Sydney Mines due to the influence of immigrants of Newfoundland Irish descent. ==Prince Edward Island== Prince Edward Island has long been associated with traditional Celtic music. Fiddle is the most popular instrument for traditional Celtic music in Prince Edward Island, and piano is the most popular accompaniment instrument. Celtic songs tend to be ballads or other popular songs, or new songs in the same tradition with contemporary backing. Where celidh dance is regular and popular in many rural communities, Irish or Celtic themed nightlife exists in both major cities of Charlottetown and Summerside. Organizations supporting traditional Celtic music include the PEI Fiddlers Association and the Benevolent Irish Society. ==Quebec== Genticorum, a traditional and Celtic band performing at a Solstice Festival, 18 June 2011 There are strong ties between traditional Québécois music and the music of Brittany, Ireland, Scotland and the Maritimes. The songs generally draw more from the French tradition, whereas the dance tunes are more closely related to Celtic traditions. Fiddle and accordion are the most common lead instruments, while piano and guitar often provide accompaniment. More recently, swing has significantly influenced accompaniment styles and techniques. La Bottine Souriante is one of the most well-recognized groups which exemplifies this tradition. ==Popular music== A number of popular Canadian Celtic rock bands are also influenced by Celtic folk traditions. The most important and influential such band was Vancouver's Spirit of the West, whose musical marriage of traditional Irish and Scottish jigs and reels with hard rock and Britpop influences paved the way for later acts such as Great Big Sea, Enter the Haggis, the Stoaters, Captain Tractor, Mackeel, The Mahones, The Dunn Boys, The Clanns, Ashley MacIsaac, Jimmy George, Mudmen, Uisce Beatha, the Paperboys and The Clumsy Lovers. Figgy Duff and The Rankin Family served much the same role in pop music, influencing later artists such as Leahy, Mary Jane Lamond, The Barra MacNeils and Natalie MacMaster. == See also == *Music of Canada *Irish-Canadian *Canadian Gaelic *Scottish-Canadian *Scots-Quebecer External Links: Celtic Music Base Category:Canadian styles of music ","title":"Celtic music in Canada"},{"id":"1282194","text":"The Faroe Islands Football Association (; ), or FSF, is the governing body of all domestic football in the Faroe Islands, the highest level of which is the Faroe Islands Premier League.

It is one of the predecessor parties of the modern-day GreenLeft. ==History== The EVP was founded in March 1981 by members of the Christian Democratic Appeal (CDA), which were united in the group \\"Not by Bread Alone\\" (Niet bij Brood Alleen) and members of the Evangelical Progressive Party, which had previously left the Protestant Anti- Revolutionary Party. Both groups were opposed to the formation of the CDA and its conservative course. After winning one seat in the 1982 general election - it was unable to do so in 1981 - the party joined the opposition. The party became divided between a left wing and a centrist wing. The left wing wanted to co-operate with the Political Party of Radicals (which had split from the Catholic People's Party in 1968) and its left-wing allies, the Pacifist Socialist Party and the destalinised Communist Party of the Netherlands. The EVP was more reserved towards the CPN. The centrist wing wanted to co-operate with the Labour Party and the CDA. Although some members were willing to co- operate, the party congress rejected the co-operation with the CPN, the PSP and the PPR in the 1984 European Parliament elections. After the party lost its sole seat in the 1986 elections, co-operation with other parties become more important. For the 1989 elections the Political Party of Radicals (PPR), Pacifist Socialist Party (PSP) and the Communist Party of the Netherlands initiated a common list GreenLeft. The EVP hesitated to join, and only after the talks were concluded did it opt to enter. It got one candidate on an ineligible eleventh place. In 1991 the party officially dissolved itself into GreenLeft in the Moses and Aaron Church in Amsterdam. Prominent EVP-members became involved in the Left (wing) Cheek, a platform for the New Testament and Politics. This platform still exists, but it is only of limited importance within the party. ==Ideology and issues== The party combined left-wing ideas with a green program, inspired by the New Testament. The Sermon on the Mount was an important inspiration for the party. The Sermon was seen as an evangelical imperative to create a society where justice, peace and solidarity would rule. Important issues for the party were: *A pacifist foreign policy, especially opposition to the placement of nuclear weapons. *It sought to formulate an alternative to both capitalism and communism. It proposed the economy of enough, in which incomes would be redistributed, people would get more rest (for instance by a government-financed sabbatical for all) and damage to the environment would be limited. * The party was progressive on social and ethical issues, such as gay rights and abortion. ==Representation== This table the EVP's results in elections to the House of Representatives, as well as the party's political leadership: the fractievoorzitter is the chair of the parliamentary party and the lijsttrekker is the party's top candidate in the general election; these posts are normally taken by the party leader. { class= - !Year !

The party was open to non-religious persons. ==Organisation== ===Linked organisations=== The EVP published a periodical called \\"EVP info\\", which was continued after 1990 as \\"The Leftwing Cheek\\" within GreenLeft. Its scientific institute was Foundation for Formation and Education, which published \\"Schering en Inslag\\" ===Relationships to other parties=== The party had good relations with the Political Party of Radicals (PPR), which also had its roots in Christian democracy and emphasised green ideals. It also had good relations with the social-democratic Labour Party and the Pacifist Socialist Party (PSP). In 1989 it chose for the PPR and the PSP and merged into the GreenLeft, together with the Communist Party of the Netherlands, a party towards which the EVP was more reserved, because of its atheism, alignment with communist dictatorships and centralised organisation. ==International comparison== Internationally the party is comparable to other small parties which combine left-wing politics with religious inspiration, for instance the Swiss Christian Social Party. ==References== Category:Defunct political parties in the Netherlands Category:GroenLinks Category:Confessional parties in the Netherlands Category:Protestant political parties Category:Political parties established in 1981 Category:Political parties disestablished in 1991 Category:Defunct Christian political parties ","title":"Evangelical People's Party (Netherlands)"},{"id":"1282211","text":"An Oratory School is primarily any of several schools founded or initially operated by the Oratorians (priests of the Oratory of Saint Philip Neri), a congregation of Catholic priests.

Alt URL Ahmed Raza Khan Barelvi belonged to the Barech tribe of Pushtuns. The Barech formed a tribal grouping among the Rohilla Pushtuns of North India who founded the state of Rohilkhand. Khan's ancestors migrated from Qandahar during the Mughal rule and settled in Lahore. Khan was born on 14 June 1856 in Mohallah Jasoli, Bareilly, the North-Western Provinces. The name corresponding to the year of his birth was \\"Al Mukhtaar\\". His birth name was Muhammad.Ala Hadhrat by Bastawi, p. 25 Khan used the appellation \\"Abdul Mustafa\\" (\\"servant of the chosen one\\") prior to signing his name in correspondence.Man huwa Ahmed Rida by Shaja'at Ali al- Qadri, p.15 At the age of four he completed the recitation of the Quran. At the age of 13, he completed his Islamic Education as well as reached puberty after which he began issuing Fatwas. ===Death === Khan died on 28 October 1921 (25 Safar 1340 AH) at the age of 65, in his home at Bareilly. He was buried in the Dargah-e-Ala Hazrat which marks the site for the annual commemoration of his death. 24 October 2019 marked the 101th anniversary. ===His teachers=== According to Masud Ahmad, Khan’s teachers were: *Shah AI-i-Rasul (d. 1297/1879) *Naqi Ali Khan (d. 1297/1880) *Ahmad Zayni Dahlan Makki (d. 1299/1881) *Abd al-Rahman Siraj Makki (d. 1301/1883) *Hussayn bin Saleh (d. 1302/1884) *Abul-Hussayn Ahmad Al-Nuri (d. 1324/1906) *'Abd al-Ali Rampuri (d. 1303/1885) == Bay’at and Khilafat == In the year 1294 A.H. (1877), at the age of 22 years, Imam Ahmed Raza became the Mureed (disciple) of Imam-ul-Asfiya, Shah Aale Rasool Marehrawi. His Murshid bestowed him with Khilafat in the several Sufi Silsilas. Number of Islamic scholars received permission from him to work under his guidance.Imam, Muhammad Hassan. (2005). The Role of the Khulafa-e-Imam Ahmed Raza Khan in the Pakistan Movement 1920–1947. Diss. Karachi: University of Karachi. ==Works== Khan wrote books in Arabic, Persian and Urdu, including the thirty-volume fatwa compilation Fatawa Razaviyya, and Kanzul Iman (Translation & Explanation of the Qur'an). Several of his books have been translated into European and South Asian languages.Maarif Raza, Karachi, Pakistan. Vol.29, Issue 1–3, 2009, pages 108–09 ===Kanzul Iman (translation of the Qur'an)=== Kanzul Iman (Urdu and Arabic: کنزالایمان) is a 1910 Urdu paraphrase translation of the Qur'an by Khan. It is not associated with the Hanafi jurisprudence within Sunni Islam, and is a widely read version of translation in the Indian Subcontinent. It has been translated into English, Hindi, Bengali, Dutch, Turkish, Sindhi, Gujarati and Pashto. ===Husamul Haramain=== Husamul Haramain or Husam al Harmain Ala Munhir kufr wal myvan (The Sword of the Haramayn at the throat of unbelief and falsehood) 1906, is a treatise which declared infidels the founders of the Deobandi, Ahle Hadith and Ahmadiyya movements on the basis that they did not have the proper veneration of the Prophet Muhammad and finality of Prophethood in their writings. In defense of his verdict he obtained confirmatory signatures from 268 scholars in South Asia, and some from scholars in Mecca and Medina. The treatise is published in Arabic, Urdu, English, Turkish and Hindi. ===Fatawa Razawiyyah=== Fatawa-e-Razvia or Fatawa-e-Radaviyyah is the main fatwa (Islamic verdicts on various issues) book of his movement. It has been published in 30 volumes and in approx. 22,000 pages. It contains solution to daily problems from religion to business and from war to marriage. ===Hadaikh- e-Bakhshish=== He wrote devotional poetry in praise of the Prophet Muhammad and always discussed him in the present tense. His main book of poetry is Hadaikh-e-Bakhshish. His poems, which deal for the most part with the qualities of the Prophet, often have a simplicity and directness. They reportedly created a favorable climate for na'at writing. His Urdu couplets, entitled Mustafa jaane rahmat pe lakhon salaam (Millions of salutations on Mustafa, the Paragon of mercy), are read in movements mosques. They contain praise of the Prophet, his physical appearance (verses 33 to 80), his life and times, praise of his family and companions, praise of the awliya and saleheen (the saints and the pious). ===Other notable works=== His other works include: *Al Daulatul Makkiya Bil Madatul Ghaibiya *Al Mu'tamadul Mustanad *Al Amn o wal Ula *Alkaukabatush Shahabiya *Al Istimdaad *Al Fuyoozul Makkiyah *Al Meeladun Nabawiyyah *Fauze Mubeen Dar Radd-E-Harkate Zameen *Subhaanus Subooh *Sallus Say yaaful Hindiya *Ahkaam-e-Shariat *Az Zubdatuz Zakkiya *Abna ul Mustafa *Tamheed-e-Imaan *Angotthe Choomne ka Masla ==Beliefs == Khan saw an intellectual and moral decline of Muslims in British India. His movement was a mass movement, defending popular Sufism, which grew in response to the influence of the Deobandi movement in South Asia and the Wahhabi movement elsewhere. Khan supported Tawassul, Mawlid, the prophet Muhammad's awareness of complete knowledge of the unseen, and other practices which were opposed by Salafis and Deobandis. In this context he supported the following beliefs: * Prophet Muhammad, although is insan-e-kamil (the perfect human), possessed a nūr (light) that predates creation. This contrasts with the Deobandi view that Muhammad, was only a insan-e-kamil, a respected but physically typical human just like other humans.Pakistan perspectives, Volume 7. Pakistan Study Centre, University of Karachi, 2002 *Prophet Muhammad is haazir naazir (Haazir-o- Naazir on the deeds of his Ummah) which means that prophet views and witnesses actions of his people. This concept was interpreted by Shah Abdul Aziz in Tafsir Azizi in these words: The Prophet is observing everybody, knows their good and bad deeds, and knows the strength of faith (Imaan) of every individual Muslim and what has hindered his spiritual progress. He reached judgments with regard to certain practices and faith in his book Fatawa-e- Razvia, including: *Islamic Law is the ultimate law and following it is obligatory for all Muslims; *To refrain from Bid'ah is essential; *A Sufi without knowledge or a Shaykh without actions is a tool in the hands of the devil; *It is impermissible to imitate the Kuffar, to mingle with the misguided [and heretics] and to participate in their festivals. === Permissibility of currency notes === In 1905, Khan, on the request of contemporaries from Hijaz, wrote a verdict on the permissibility of using paper as form of currency, entitled Kifl-ul-Faqeehil fehim Fe Ahkam-e-Kirtas Drahim. === Ahmadiyyah === Mirza Ghulam Ahmad of Qadian claimed to be the Messiah and Mahdi awaited by some Muslims as well as a Ummati Nabi, a subordinate prophet to Muhammad who came to restore Islam to the pristine form as practiced by Muhammad and early Sahaba. Khan declared Mirza Ghulam Ahmad a heretic and apostate and called him and his followers disbelievers (kuffar).Aziz, Zahid. (2008). A survey of the Lahore Ahmadiyya movement: history, beliefs, aims and work. Ahmadiyya Anjuman Ishaat Islam (AAIIL), UK. p. 43, . === Deobandis === The theological difference with Deobandi school begun when Imam Ahmed Raza Khan Qadri objected in writing to some of the following beliefs of Deobandi scholars. *A founder of the Deobandi movement, Rashid Ahmad Gangohi stated that God has the ability to lie. This doctrine is called Imkan-i Kizb. According to this doctrine, because God is omnipotent, God is capable of lying. Gangohi supported the doctrine that God has the ability to make additional prophets after Muhammad (Imkan-i Nazir) and other prophets equal to Muhammad. *He opposed the doctrine that Muhammad has knowledge of the unseen (ilm e ghaib). When Imam Ahmed Raza Khan visited Mecca and Medina for pilgrimage in 1905, he prepared a draft document entitled Al Motamad Al Mustanad (\\"The Reliable Proofs\\"). In this work, Ahmad Raza branded Deobandi leaders such as Ashraf Ali Thanwi, Rashid Ahmad Gangohi, and Muhammad Qasim Nanotwi and those who followed them as kuffar. Khan collected scholarly opinions in the Hejaz and compiled them in an Arabic language compendium with the title, Husam al Harmain (\\"The Sword of Two Sanctuaries\\"), a work containing 34 verdicts from 33 ulama (20 Meccan and 13 Medinese). This work initiated a reciprocal series of fatwas between Barelvis and Deobandis lasting to the present.*Siraj Khan, Blasphemy against the Prophet, in Muhammad in History, Thought, and Culture (Editors: Coeli Fitzpatrick and Adam Hani Walker), , pp. 59–67 *R Ibrahim (2013), Crucified Again, , pp. 100–101 === Shia === Khan wrote various books against beliefs and faith of Shia Muslims and declared various practices of Shia as kufr. Most Shiites of his day were apostates because, he believed, they repudiated necessities of religion.Fatawa-e-Razavia, Fatwa on Sunni marriage with shia, Book of Marriage; vol.11/pg345, Lahore editionhttp://www.islamic.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/Fiqh/Sunni%20marriage%20with%20Shia.htm === Wahabi Movement === Khan declared Wahabis as disbelievers (kuffar) and collected many fatwas of various scholars against the Wahabbi movement founded by Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab, who was predominant in the Arabian peninsula, just as he had done with the Ahmadis and Deobandis. Until this day, Khan's followers remain opposed to the Wahabi and their beliefs. ==Political views== Unlike other Muslim leaders in the region at the time, Khan and his movement opposed the Indian independence movement due to its leadership under Mahatma Gandhi, who was not a Muslim.R. Upadhyay, Barelvis and Deobandhis: \\"Birds of the Same Feather\\". Eurasia Review, courtesy of the South Asia Analysis Group. 28 January 2011. Khan declared that India was Dar al-Islam and that Muslims enjoyed religious freedom there. According to him, those arguing the contrary merely wanted to take advantage of the provisions allowing Muslims living under non-Muslim rule to collect interest from commercial transactions and had no desire to fight Jihad or perform Hijra. Therefore, he opposed labeling British India to be Dar al-Harb (\\"abode of war\\"), which meant that waging holy war against and migrating from India were inadmissible as they would cause disaster to the community. This view of Khan's was similar to other reformers Syed Ahmed Khan and Ubaidullah Ubaidi Suharwardy. The Muslim League mobilized the Muslim masses to campaign for Pakistan, and many of Khan's followers played a significant and active role in the Pakistan Movement at educational and political fronts. ==Legacy== Today the movement Khan founded is spread across the globe with followers in Pakistan, India, Bangladesh, Turkey, Afghanistan, Iraq, Sri Lanka, South Africa, United States, Australia, Korea, Hong Kong, and UK, among other countries. The movement now has over 200 million followers. The movement was largely a rural phenomenon when begun, but is currently popular among urban, educated Pakistanis and Indians as well as South Asian diaspora throughout the world.

Sir John was the youngest son of Timothy Eaton, the founder of the T. Eaton Company Department Store, or Eaton's, and he inherited the business and became its president upon his father's death in 1907. Sir John was one of the wealthiest men in Canada, and in 1909 he commissioned a home to be built on \\"The Hill\\", a name used to describe the neighborhood on the Davenport Hill in Toronto where many wealthy families built their homes. Casa Loma, built by Henry Pellatt and the largest private house ever constructed in Canada, was near Ardwold, as were Spadina House, the mansion of James Austin, and Glenedyth, the estate of Samuel Nordheimer. Ardwold is a Gaelic term meaning \\"high, green hill\\". The massive mansion was designed by Toronto architect Frank Wickson of Wickson and Gregg Architectural firm. It was in the Georgian style, and influenced by English and Irish country homes, namely Belton House in Lincolnshire. Ardwold had 50 rooms, 14 bathrooms, and its own hospital. Situated on eleven acres (45,000 m²) of landscaped grounds, which included a half-acre (2,000 m²) glassed area housing conservatory and swimming pool, Ardwold was one of the largest and most luxurious residences in Toronto and the country. Sir John Craig Eaton died in 1922, and his widow Lady Eaton kept the home until 1936, when she sold the land. Eaton moved to the enormous chateau named Eaton Hall at King City, Ontario. After an auction of much of its contents, Ardwold was blown up (the walls were too thick to use ordinary methods of wreckage). The property was divided into an exclusive housing development named Ardwold Gate. Only the gate lodge on Spadina Road near Austin Terrace remains. ==References== * Category:Eaton's Category:Houses in Toronto Category:Demolished buildings and structures in Toronto Category:Houses completed in 1911 Category:Buildings and structures demolished in 1936 ","title":"Ardwold"},{"id":"1282233","text":"The University of Applied Arts Vienna (, or informally just Die Angewandte) is an arts university and institution of higher education in Vienna, the capital of Austria.

According to a legend, a blind and crippled old man named Tekir and his old donkey reached the shore of the lake by mistake. Trying to pull his stubborn animal out of the mud, Tekir was miraculously healed so he could see and walk normally again. Since then the lake has become famous for its healing properties. Tekir and his donkey are featured in a statue located in the center of the town. The name also means (in Turkish) \\"Striped Lake\\" (tekir - striped, and göl - lake). This is because of the salinity of the lake; when the wind blows, white salt stripes appear on the surface of the lake. ==Location== Town is in the south east extremity of Romania (Constanța County), situated on the north west shore of Lake Techirghiol (11.6 km2), elevation 15–20 m, 18 km south of the municipality of Constanța and very close to the Black Sea (3 km). In Techirghiol the winters are mild and the summers are warm, dominant being the clear skies (the sun shines for more than 2,400 hours every year). ==History== Techirghiol was first marked on the country's map in 1893 but developed steadily after 1912, establishing itself as a spa town.

In 1924, at the Universal Exposition from Paris, the Techirghiol mud received the golden medal. Alphons Saligny was the first to study the therapeutic use of the mud; after this the Romanian Institute of Balneology approved it and during the 1930s the studies realized by Alphons Saligny and the Institute were the base for solid scientific proof regarding the therapeutic actions of the sapropelic mud of Techirghiol and the methodology of those treatments. The sapropelic mud of Techirghiol is used warm for different kind of procedures: *Wraps *Cataplasm *Water mixed, for baths in bathtubs *Massage The use of therapeutic mud is also recommended for: *Better skin elasticity, *Hydration for cell strengthening and for dryness prevention. *Skin healing (in cases of psoriasis and eczema) *A better state of well-being and relaxation *Improvement of pain from anterior accidents, as well as those from rheumatism and muscular immobility. *General detoxification of the organism can easily be achieved after a series of general massages with mud, or after a cure of wrappings in the comfort of your own home, or in a specialized saloon, or on the seashore. ==Places of interest== *Lake Techirghiol *Saint Mary Monastery *Techirghiol Balneotherapy Center ==Demographics== At the 2011 census, Techirghiol had 5,646 Romanians (82.48%), 8 Hungarians (0.12%), 27 Roma (0.39%), 336 Turks (4.91%), 615 Tatars (8.98%), 6 Lipovans (0.09%), 17 Aromanians (0.25%), 184 others (2.69%), 6 with undeclared ethnicity (0.09%). ==Notable natives== *Jean Constantin, Romanian actor ==References== ==External links== *Alternative website about Techirghiol *Legends of Techirghiol *Techirghiol Balneotherapy Center *Saint Mary Monastery Category:Towns in Romania Category:Populated places in Constanța County Category:Localities in Northern Dobruja Category:Populated coastal places in Romania Category:Spa towns in Romania Category:Place names of Turkish origin in Romania ","title":"Techirghiol"},{"id":"1282276","text":"Topoloveni () is a town in Argeș County, Romania on the Cârcinov River.

Roberts was born in San Francisco, California, on May 12, 1921. He enlisted in the U.S. Naval Reserve in 1939 and was called to active duty in 1940. Roberts served aboard the USS California (BB-44) and the transport USS Heywood (AP-12), before being transferred to the cargo transport USS Bellatrix (AK-20, later AKA-20). In 1942, Bellatrix was assigned to Task Group Four and became part of the Guadalcanal Assault Force. As a coxswain for the Bellatrix's assault boats, Roberts helped ferry supplies from the transport ships to a tenuous beachhead. After the ships withdrew in the face of Japanese attacks that began 7 August 1942, Roberts volunteered for duty on the island of Guadalcanal, where he was attached to a beachmaster unit at Lunga Point. The unit, which included Navy and United States Coast Guard sailors, transported Marines and their supplies to beaches along the island's northern coast, and also evacuated wounded Marines. Early on the morning of 27 September 1942, Roberts volunteered for a rescue mission to save a company- size unit of Marines that had been surrounded by a larger Japanese force. The rescue group of several Higgins boats was taken under heavy fire and was perilously close to failure. Roberts volunteered to distract Japanese forces by guiding his boat directly in front of their lines, drawing their fire. This decoy act was performed effectively until all Marines had been evacuated. However, as he was about to withdraw from the range of the Japanese guns, Roberts’ boat was hit and he was mortally wounded. His boatmates brought him back to base and he was flown out on a medical evacuation flight, but died the next day. Roberts was awarded the Navy Cross for his valor in the face of enemy fire. ==Warships named for Roberts== *, a John C.

The first group were members of the Protestant-Christian Anti- Revolutionary Party, secondly the National Evangelical Union, a small party which had earlier left the ARP, and several independent electoral committees. The founders opposed the formation of the Christian Democratic Appeal, because the Protestant ARP and Christian Historical Union would join the Catholic People's Party. During the period of pillarisation, the Catholics and Protestants had lived in a form of cold war. The RPF sought to unite all other orthodox Protestant Christian parties, namely the Reformed Political League (GPV) and the Reformed Political Party (SGP). In the subsequent 1977 elections the RPF was unable to win any seats. In 1981 it won two seats in House of Representatives (Meindert Leerling and Aad Wagenaar). In the period 1981 to 2002 it had one to three members. It also won seats in the Dutch Senate. The remained in opposition throughout its existence. In 1985 one of its two members of parliament seceded form the party to form the Anti-Revolutionaries 1985, the party never got any seat. In 1996 RPF party leader Leen van Dijke came under public criticism when magazine Nieuwe Revu had suggested that in an interview he had declared: \\"Why would stealing, for example committing social welfare fraud, be less of a sin than going against the seventh commandment? Yes, why should someone in a homosexual relationship be better than a thief?\\" When turmoil broke out, Van Dijke explained that he had meant to convey a universally accepted vision within Christianity that trespassing one of God's commandments makes a man guilty before God, and that all breaches herein are equal. But the general public, and especially the Dutch gay movement, criticised the statement as printed in Nieuwe Revu heavily, considering it discrimination. As such, a gay magazine (Gaykrant) reported it to the Attorney General. In 1999 the Dutch high court ruled that Van Dijke's views were not discriminatory according to Dutch law. From 1998 the RPF and GPV began to work closely together in parliament. In 2000 the Christian Union, in which both would unite was officially founded. In 2002 it first contested in elections and won 5 seats. ==Linked organisations== The Party magazine was called RPF signal and the scientific foundation Marnix van St. Aldegonde Stichting. The Evangelical Broadcasting Association had strong personal and ideological links with the RPF, but it was never officially linked to the party. ==Ideology== The RPF believed that society should be based on Biblical norms and values. The political differences between the GPV and SGP, the two other orthodox Protestant parties, were marginal and based on theological differences. The RPF was a staunch defender of the Dutch monarchy and a strong government. It opposed abortion, euthanasia and same-sex marriage. In economic and environmental issues, the RPF was in favour of strong government influence. Internationally the party was comparable to the American Christian Right and the small Protestant parties of Scandinavia, such as the Christian Democratic Party of Norway, the Swedish and Danish Christian Democrats. The RPF never took part in a government coalition, instead it chose to voice its concerns over government policies, while acknowledging that the party itself (a testimonial party) was not big enough to force its opinion upon others. ==Electorate== The number of the RPF membership throughout years The RPF was supported by orthodox Reformed of many denominations, such as the Reformed Churches and the Dutch Reformed Church. But also members of newer churches such as the Evangelical Church and the Pentecostal community supported this party. The electorate was concentrated in Zeeland, the Veluwe, parts of Overijssel, forming what is known as the Dutch Bible Belt. == Party leaders == * Meindert Leerling: 1980 - 1994 * Leen van Dijke: 1994 - 2001 ==Notes== ==References== Category:Christian Union (Netherlands) Category:Confessional parties in the Netherlands Category:Defunct Christian political parties Category:Defunct political parties in the Netherlands Category:Political parties established in 1975 Category:Political parties disestablished in 2003 Category:Protestant political parties Category:Conservative parties in the Netherlands Category:1975 establishments in the Netherlands Category:2003 disestablishments in Europe ","title":"Reformatory Political Federation"},{"id":"1282323","text":"The Medina River is located in south central Texas, United States, in the Medina Valley. It was also known as the Rio Mariano, Rio San Jose, or Rio de Bagres (Catfish river). Its source is in springs in the Edwards Plateau in northwest Bandera County, Texas and merges with the San Antonio River in southern Bexar County, Texas, for a course of 120 miles. It contains the Medina Dam in NE Medina County, Texas which restrains Lake Medina. Much of its course is owned and operated by the Bexar-Medina-Atascosa Water District to provide irrigation services to farmers and ranches. ==History== The Medina River was named after Pedro de Medina, a Spanish cartographer, by Alonso de León, Spanish governor of Coahuila, New Spain in 1689. It once served as the official boundary between Texas and Coahuila with the San Antonio River being considered its tributary. At that time, the river was called the Medina all the way to the Gulf of Mexico, but now the part below the confluence is called the San Antonio River. From 1849, Castroville on the river was a water stop on the San Antonio-El Paso Road and a stagecoach station on the San Antonio-El Paso Mail and San Antonio-San Diego Mail Line. ==Natural features== Much of the source water to the Medina River is produced by springs emerging due to the presence of the Balcones Fault. This locale of the Balcones Fault is associated with an important ecological dividing line for species occurrence. For example, species such as the California Fan Palm, Washingtonia filifera, occur only west of the Medina River or Balcones Fault.C.

In general, prospective adoptive parents must meet the legal adoption requirements of their country of residence and those of the country whose nationality the child holds. International adoption is not the same thing as transcultural or interracial adoption. However, the fact is that a family will often become a transcultural or interracial family upon the adoption of a child internationally. The laws of countries vary in their willingness to allow international adoptions. Some countries have established rules and procedures for international adoptions, while other countries expressly forbid it. Various countries, notably many African nations, have extended residency requirements for adoptive parents that, in effect, rule out most international adoptions. ==Process overview== The requirements necessary to begin the process of international adoption can vary depending on the country of the adoptive parent(s). For example, while most countries require prospective adoptive parents to first get approval to adopt, in some the approval can only be given afterwards. Often an \\"orphan\\" is a child whose living birth family has consented to an adoption. Some describe orphanages as \\"nurseries\\" or \\"children's homes\\" because in numerous instances children's parents have not consented to an adoption of their children. It is not uncommon for a parent to put a child in a \\"nursery\\" temporarily while they deal with poverty or work, or want to take advantage of the educational opportunities in the orphanage/nursery. Because orphanages/nurseries often provide education, they function more like subsidized boarding school.Choy, Catherine Ceniza. “Race at the Center: The History of American Cold War Asian Adoption.” The Journal of American-East Asian Relations 16, no. 3 (2009): 163–82. Prospective parents of international adoptees wait to get a referral for a child, which often means waiting until one of these parents of the children in nurseries/orphanages consents to the adoption. Although bureaucracy is often blamed for the slow process of adopting a child, often what is to blame is that the demand for children in the less-developed world exceeds the supply. A senior advisor on child protection with UNICEF, Alexandria Yuster, argues that international adoption is now more about finding children for first world (developed world) parents than finding homes for children. Susan Bissell, also of UNICEF, said that she does not oppose international adoption, but believes that it is preferable for abandoned children to be taken back by their previous families and advises governments to provide small monetary incentives to families who are willing to do so. In the United States, typically the first stage of the process is selecting a licensed adoption agency or attorney to work with. Each agency or attorney tends to work with a different set of countries, although some only focus on a single country. Pursuant to the rules of the Hague Adoption Convention (an international treaty related to adoption issues) the adoption agency or attorney must be accredited by the U.S. government if the child's country is also a participant in the Hague Convention. If the child's country is not a participant then the rules of the Hague do not apply, and the specific laws of the child's and adoptive parent(s)' countries must be followed. Even when the Hague does not apply, a home study and USCIS (United States Citizen and Immigration Services; formerly INS, Immigration and Naturalization Service) approval are requirements. The Hague is discussed below. A dossier is prepared that contains a large amount of information about the prospective adoptive parents required by the child's country. Typically this includes financial information, a background check, fingerprints, a home study review by a social worker, report from the adoptive parents' doctor regarding their health, and other supporting information. Again, requirements will vary widely from country to country, and even region to region in large countries such as Russia. Once complete, the dossier is submitted to the appropriate authorities in the child's country for review.Adoption: The Essential Guide to Adopting Quickly and Safely, by Randall Hicks, Perigee Press 2007 After the dossier is reviewed and the prospective parents are approved to adopt, they are matched to an eligible child (except in some countries such as India, which does not allow \\"matching\\" of a child to (a) prospective parent(s)). The parent is usually sent information about the child, such as age, gender, health history, etc. This is generally called a referral. A travel date is typically provided at a later time in most adoptions. However, some countries might also provide a travel date at the time of referral, informing the parents when they may travel to meet the child and sign any additional paperwork required to accept the referral. Some countries, such as Kazakhstan, do not allow referrals until the prospective parent travels to the country on their first trip. This is called a \\"blind\\" referral. Depending on the country, the parents may have to make more than one trip overseas to complete the legal process. Some countries allow a child to be escorted to the adoptive parents' home country and the adoptive parents are not required to travel to the country of their adopted child. There are usually several requirements after this point, such as paperwork to make the child a legal citizen of the adopting parents' country or re-adopt them. In addition, one or more follow up (or \\"post placement\\") visits from a social worker may be required--either by the placing agency used by the adoptive parents or by the laws of the country from which the child was adopted. In the United States, citizenship is automatically granted to all foreign-born children when at least one adoptive parent is a U.S. citizen, in accordance with the Child Citizenship Act of 2000. Depending on the circumstances of the adoption, the grant of citizenship takes place upon the child's admission to the U.S. as an immigrant or the child's adoption in the parent's home jurisdiction. ===Policies and requirements=== Adoption policies for each country vary widely. Information such as the age of the adoptive parents, financial status, educational level, marital status and history, number of dependent children in the house, sexual orientation, weight, psychological health, and ancestry are used by countries to determine what parents are eligible to adopt from that country. Information such as the age of the child, fees and expenses, and the amount of travel time required in the child's birth country can also vary widely from one country to another. Each country sets its own rules, timelines and requirements surrounding adoption, and there are also rules that vary within the United States for each state. Each country, and often each part of the country, sets its own rules about what will be shared and how it will be shared (e.g., a picture of the child, child's health). Reliability and verifiability of the information is variable. Most countries require that a parent travel to bring the child home; however, some countries allow the child to be escorted to his or her new homeland. The U.S. Department of State has designated two accrediting entities for organizations providing inter-country adoption services in the United States and work with sending countries that have ratified the Hague Convention on Protection of Children and Co-operation in Respect of Intercountry Adoption. They are the Council on Accreditation and the Colorado Department of Health and Human Services. The U.S. Department of State maintains a list of all accredited international adoption providers. ==Major origin and receiving countries of children == Basic demographic data on origin and receiving countries since the 2000s have only recently been analyzed and summarized in a specialized publication. ===Major origin countries of children === China is the leading origin country of children. In the US, at least 25% of overall international adoptions from 1997-2016 were of Chinese children. According to one recent study, 6 countries (China, Ethiopia, India, South Korea, Ukraine and Vietnam) were major origin countries for almost a decade in the period 2003-2011. Yet there has been slight change in other countries sending most children. In 2019, the top sending countries for children adopted by US citizens were China, Ukraine, Colombia, India, South Korea, Bulgaria, Haiti, Nigeria.https://apnews.com/article/607d63b84db7621c44019c5e4aaefe27https://travel.state.gov/content/dam/NEWadoptionassets/pdfs/FY%202019%20Annual%20Report%20.pdf ===Major receiving countries=== Based on Selman's research, during the year of 1998 and 2007, the top 10 receiving countries of all 23 reported countries, (ranked from the large to small), are the United States, Spain, France, Italy, Canada, Netherlands, Sweden, Norway, Denmark, and Australia. Among these 10 countries, the top 5 accounts for more than 80% of overall adoption, and the US is responsible for around 50% of all cases. Although historically the United States has been among the leaders in adopting children via international adoption, this has changed dramatically over the last decade. In 2004, 22,884 children were adopted internationally, while only 2,971 were adopted in 2019. https://apnews.com/article/607d63b84db7621c44019c5e4aaefe27https://travel.state.gov/content/dam/NEWadoptionassets/pdfs/FY%202019%20Annual%20Report%20.pdf This is attributed to a combination of factors: increased bureaucracy due to implementation of the Hague Convention guidelines, legal changes in the countries from which the adoptions occur eliminating countries from which to adopt, increased cost, corruption in some foreign courts/orphanages, and the policy of many countries to only free child with significant special needs. ====The US (as the largest receiving country)==== China has long been a major sending country in international adoption. In 2019, the top sending countries for children adopted by US citizens were China (819), Ukraine (298), Colombia (244), India (241), South Korea (166), Bulgaria (134), Haiti (130), Nigeria (116).https://apnews.com/article/607d63b84db7621c44019c5e4aaefe27https://travel.state.gov/content/dam/NEWadoptionassets/pdfs/FY%202019%20Annual%20Report%20.pdf These statistics can vary from year to year as each country alters its rules; adoption from Ethiopia used to be common, but international adoption was banned in 2018 by Ethiopia.https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-42635641 There were only 11 adoptions from Ethiopia in 2019, compared with 177 in 2018 and a high of 313 in 2017, when Ethiopia was No. 2 on the list.https://apnews.com/article/607d63b84db7621c44019c5e4aaefe27 Romania, Belarus, Russia and Cambodia were also important until government crackdowns on adoptions to weed out abuse in the system cut off the flow. Abuses with regard to adoption in some Eastern European countries in the 1990s led to bans on international adoptions in those countries in the 21st century.https://www.dw.com/en/romania-bans-foreign-adoptions/a-1243642 China has long been a major sending country in international adoption, but recently the numbers have fallen (although it still remains a leader), due to an improved Chinese economy and more restrictive laws.https://apnews.com/article/607d63b84db7621c44019c5e4aaefe27 Concerns about abuses with regard to international adoption have been raised for years with regard to China.http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia- pacific/8130900.stmhttps://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-pacific-13350757 Sex ratio of children adopted (US)  The image shows the sex of children adopted from China in the period 1997-2016. In all the years shown except 2016, more adoptees were female. The previous years’ difference in sex may be connected to the one-child policy in combination with Chinese cultural values, which led to more girls being abandoned. Generally, the US adopts more girls than boys. From 1999 to 2012, around 62% of adoptees by US families were girls, and only 38% were boys.source: the statistics section of International Adoption, under the US Government, http://adoption.state.gov/about_us/statistics.php, select \\"All Countries\\" for detailed figure Yet this discrepancy between female and male adoptees has gradually declined. In other words, now the sex ratio of girls and boys adopted is more balanced.source: the statistics section of International Adoption, under the US Government, http://adoption.state.gov/ab.out_us/statistics.php, select \\"All Countries\\" and different years for detailed figure and comparison It used to be true that China had more girls available for adoption, due to the Chinese culture's preference for sons in combination with the official planned birth policy implemented in 1979. Until the early 2000s, around 90–95% of Chinese children adopted by American families were girls. For numerous reasons, including a recent amendment of the one child policy, the dwindling number of available females for marriage, and an increased prevalence of sex selective abortions, most orphanages in China now house only children with special needs, the majority of which are male. Because of the heavy preference for females in adopting families most waiting children in China are boys, as girls with the same needs are quickly matched with a long line of families seeking Chinese daughters. Although India also has a noticeable excess of girls available for adoption (around 70%),source: the statistics section of International Adoption, under the US Government, http://adoption.state.gov/about_us/statistics.php, select \\"India\\" for detailed figure In contrast, South Korea, another East Asian country, has a relatively large excess of boys being adopted; about 60% are boys.source: the statistics section of International Adoption, under the US Government, http://adoption.state.gov/about_us/statistics.php, select \\"South Korea\\" for detailed figure Countries suspending/ or be suspended adoption by US families There have been several countries (including certain major sending countries) that are completely not or only partially accepting intercountry adoption request from US families for certain reasons. :* Russia: In December 2012, Russian President Vladimir Putin signed into law a measure, effective January 1, 2013, banning the adoption of Russian children by US families.It was claimed to be enacted due to the fact that adopted children developed psychiatric problems because they were ripped away from their native culture. The ban was seen as diplomatic retaliation for the passage of the Magnitsky Act in the US, while popular support in Russia focused on incidents of abuse to adoptees by US parents.http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0605/03/ng.01.html In January 2013 about 20,000 people marched against the law in Moscow. :* Ethiopia: In February 2018, the Ethiopian Parliament amended the country's adoption laws and removed reference to adoption of its citizens by foreigners. The new law became effective on February 18, 2018. The US also suspended adoption relationship with selected countries, due to Hague Convention or other rationales. :* Vietnam, temporarily suspended due to allegations of corruption and baby-sellinghttp://www.amchamvietnam.com/2097/ :* Guatemala, the adoption was shut down in 2007 for adoption after allegations of corruption, families being coerced and children kidnapped to feed U.S. demand. (See also: Adoption in Guatemala) :* Nepal: Although Nepal has not closed its doors for adoption, the United States government has suspended adoptions from Nepal. Documents that were presented documenting the abandonment of these children in Nepal have been found to be unreliable and circumstances of alleged abandonment cannot be verified because of obstacles in the investigation of individual cases. ==International legal framework== At the international level, the main legal instrument on intercountry adoption is the Convention on Protection of Children and Co-operation in Respect of Intercountry Adoption (hereafter the Hague Adoption Convention, 1993). However other relevant international legal instruments exist to ensure that the best interest of the child and the concern for her/his welfare inform the practices of intercountry adoption. For example, the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (1989) contains some specific references to intercountry adoption.Trevor Buck, \\"International Child Law\\", New York: Routledge, 2011 The Declaration on Social and Legal Principles relating to the Protection and Welfare of Children, with Special Reference to Foster Placement and Adoption Nationally and Internationally (1986)Resolution A/RES/41/85 calls Member States to establish policy, legislation and effective supervision for the protection of children involved in intercountry adoption. All those instruments have some common principles: ::* The principle of subsidiarity according to which intercountry adoption should only take place when suitable adoptive parents cannot be identified in the country of origin of the child ::* The best interest of the child should be the paramount consideration ::* The placement of the child should be made through competent authorities or agencies with the same safeguards and standards as national adoptions ::* In no case should an adoption result in improper financial gains for those involved. According to the Convention of the Rights of the Child (art. 21), as well as to the UN Declaration on the Protection and Welfare of Children (art. 17) and the Hague Adoption Convention (Preamble and art. 4), international adoption should be considered as an option if other arrangements (with priority to kin and adoptive families) cannot satisfactorily be arranged for the child in her or his country of origin (principle of subsidiarity between national and international adoption). However the international community still disagrees on the point whether the option of being placed in a permanent family setting through international adoption should prevail on the alternative of the placement of children in domestic care institutions. The United Nations Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the Sale of Children, Child Prostitution and Child Pornography (2000)United Nations, Treaty Series, vol. 2171, No. 27531, p. 227 is an additional international instrument that calls on States parties to ensure that coercive adoption is criminalized under national law, regardless of whether the offence is committed domestically or transnationally, on an individual or organized basis. ===UN Declaration Relating to the Welfare of Children (1986)=== The UN Declaration on Social and Legal Principles relating to the Protection and Welfare of Children, with Special Reference to Foster Placement and Adoption Nationally and Internationally was adopted by General Assembly resolution 41/85 of 3 December 1986. The UN Declaration Relating to the Welfare of Children reaffirms principle 6 of the Declaration of the Rights of the Child, according to which, \\"The child shall, wherever possible, grow up in the care and under the responsibility of his parents and, in any case, in an atmosphere of affection and of moral and material security.\\" Article 17 affirms the principle of subsidiarity in these terms: \\"If a child cannot be placed in a foster or an adoptive family or cannot in any suitable manner be cared for in the country of origin, intercountry adoption may be considered as an alternative means of providing the child with a family.\\" Article 24 requires Member States to consider the child's cultural and religious background and interest. The Declaration encourages States not to hurry the adoptive process. Article 15 states, \\"Sufficient time and adequate counselling should be given to the child's own parents, the prospective adoptive parents and, as appropriate, the child in order to reach a decision on the child's future.\\" ===UN Convention on the Rights of the Child (1989)=== The United Nations Convention on the Right of the Child marks a turning point in the international law of children's rights recognizing the child as an active subject of international law whose views must be taken into consideration when dealing with matters affecting her or him (art.12). The principle of the best interests of the child should be a primary consideration in all actions concerning children, whether undertaken by public or private social welfare institutions, courts of law, administrative authorities or legislative bodies (art, 3). This same principle shall be the paramount consideration also when States Parties recognize and/or permit the system of adoption. Particularly, article 21 requires that States Parties \\"ensure that the adoption of a child is authorized only by competent authorities who determine that the adoption is permissible in view of the child's status concerning parents, relatives and legal guardians and that, if required, the persons concerned have given their informed consent to the adoption. The placement of the child also should not result in improper financial gain for those involved in it (art. 21.d). ===The Hague Adoption Convention (1993)=== Recognizing some of the difficulties and challenges associated with international adoption, and to protect those involved from the corruption, abuses, and exploitation that sometimes accompanies it, in 1993 the Hague Conference on Private International Law developed the Convention on Protection of Children and Co-operation in Respect of Intercountry Adoption. The Convention came into force on May 1995. As of December 2018, there were 99 states parties to the Convention. Korea, Nepal and the Russian Federation are signatories but have not ratified. With respect to the previous multilateral instruments, which include some provisions regarding intercountry adoption, the Hague Adoption Convention is the major multilateral instrument regulating international adoption. It calls for coordination and direct cooperation between countries to ensure that appropriate safeguards promote the best interest of the child (Article 1) and prevent the abduction, sale, or trafficking of children. The Convention also requires that all processes should be authorized by central adoption authorities designated by the contracting states. (Chapter III of the Convention outlines the roles and responsibilities of this authority.) If fully implemented at the national level, the Convention offers also a protective framework against the risks potentially implied in private adoption (when the adoptive parents set the terms of the adoption directly with the birth parents or with children's institutions placed in the country of origin, without recurring to accredited adoption service providers).Isabelle Lammerant, Marlène Hofstetter, \\"Adoption: at what cost? For an ethical responsibility of receiving countries in intercountry adoption\\", Terre des homes, 2007; HCCH 2008) The implementation and Operation of the 1993 Hague Intercountry Adoption Convention: Guide to Good Practice – Guide No. 1, Bristol: Family Law/Jordan Publishing Ltd The Convention lets states decide which public agency is the central adoption authority (whose supervision and authorization is necessary to proceed with adoption (article 17 ) and which other bodies should be accredited as the provider of adoption services (Article 9).Isabelle Lammerant, Marlène Hofstetter, \\"Adoption: at what cost? For an ethical responsibility of receiving countries in intercountry adoption\\", Terre des homes, 2007 If fully implemented at the national level, the Convention offers also a protective framework against the risks potentially implied in private adoption (when the adoptive parents set the terms of the adoption directly with the birth parents, without recurring to accredited bodies). The Implementation and Operation of the 1993 Inter country Adoption Convention****: Guide to Good Practice provides a guidance for the Convention operation, use and interpretation. The Convention is crucial because it provides formal international and intergovernmental recognition of intercountry adoption, working to ensure that adoptions under the Convention are recognized in other party countries. To comply with international standards, many changes have been introduced in national legislation enacting laws to criminalize the act of obtaining improper gains from intercountry adoptions.UNDP, Child Adoption. Trends and Policies Report, 2009 However instances of trafficking in and sale of children for the purpose of adoption continue to take place in many parts of the world. Especially during emergency situations, natural disasters or conflicts, has been found that children are adopted without following appropriate legal procedures and risk to be victims of trafficking and sale.United Nations, \\"Second Periodic reports of States parties due in 1998, Rwanda (CRC/C/70/Add22) It has been raised also the issue that an excessive bureaucratization of the adoption process – following the implementation of the Hague Adoption Convention – possibly establishes additional barriers to the placement of children.Elizabeth Bartholet, International Adoption: Current Status and Future Prospects, 1993, p. 95 ==Regional and domestic legal orders== ===Africa=== Much interest is shown for cases of international adoption in Africa especially after highly publicized stories of adoption of African children by celebrities like Madonna and Angelina Jolie. Legal frameworks on adoption in general and on international adoption in particular are available across Africa and may vary from one country to another. The following overview of legal provisions put into place by African countries reflects a diverse but not a comprehensive view on how the question of international adoption is dealt with on the African continent. The focus is on countries for which bibliographical resources were immediately accessible. ====The Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) ==== On September 25, 2013, the government of the Democratic Republic of Congo enacted a suspension of exit permits for Congolese adoptive children that prevents adoptive children from being allowed to depart the country with their adoptive parents. Although Congolese courts continue to issue new adoption decrees, these are not currently recognized by the Congolese immigration service, the Direction Generale de Migration (DGM), which controls the points of entry. Congolese officials have said the suspension will remain in place until the parliament enacts new legislation reforming the adoption process. Because of the suspension, the U.S Department of State announced on October 6, 2014, that it strongly recommends against adopting from the DRC at this time. According to the DRC Family Code, an adopted holds the same rights as a biological child in the adopting family. Links with original family are preserved. This regime is applied to simple adoption. As far as international adoption is concerned, the DRC Law does not provide a definition specifically; but the judicial practice authorizes the adoption of Congolese children by foreign parents. Fundamental principles for any child adoption are defined by Law No. 09/001 from 10 January 2009 relating child protection, as follow:art. 18, Law No. 09/001 from 10 January 2009 relating child protection * All children are entitled to adoption * The adoption of a child by a foreigner can only happen when competent authorities from the origin state: # Have verified, after having examined the social conditions in the origin state that the adoption is to be done in the best interest of the child. # Have made sure that: ## The consent for adoption is not given in exchange with payment or any kind of compensation and that this consent was not later retrieved. ## The Child's wishes and opinions have been taken into account in accordance with their age and level of maturity ## The consent expressed by the child for their adoption, when it is required, is freely expressed in ways required by the law, and that this consent is given or recorded in a written formArt. 18 Child Protection Code, Official Journal of the DRC, 25 May 2009, p. 10 As for conditions to be met in the host state for a valid international adoption, article 19 of the Child Protection Code explains that the host state should certify that: * The future parents are qualified and are capable of adopting children * The adopted child is authorized to enter and reside permanently in the host countryArt. 19 Child Protection Code, Official Journal 25 May 2009, p. 10; Ndomba K., E. L., Family Code, 2010, pp. XII, 218 However, even though international adoption is allowed under fulfillment of the above-mentioned conditions, article 20 of the DRC Child Protection Code denies the right to adoption to homosexuals, pedophiles and mentally-ill people. ====Ethiopia==== In 2018, Ethiopia banned the adoption of children by foreigners. This followed the conviction of U.S. parents, Carri and Larry Williams, who were found guilty of manslaughter after their thirteen-year old Ethiopian adopted daughter, Hana Williams, died of hypothermia in 2011. The Ethiopian Government's official news outlet, ENA, claims that the state banned international adoptions due to concerns over child abuse and neglect overseas. There were instances of children who were relinquished by their parents and listed as orphans on adoption registries, which led to the avoidance of undesirable court procedures. Some critics of international adoption cite the reason for unethical adoption processes as being the high demand that countries faced from adoptive parents. From an Ethiopian standpoint, some citizens felt that international adoption was becoming \\"the new export industry\\" of their country at the time of its peak around 2008. In 2016, Denmark officially ended international adoption with Ethiopia over concerns surrounding the ethics of the adoption process, as well as the health and safety of the children involved. According to the U.S. State Department, Ethiopia is not a signatory to the 1980 Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction (Hague Abduction Convention). The Hague Abduction Convention attempts to negate the harmful side effects that can result in countries participating in international adoption. The convention \\"focuses on the child,\\" rather than the adoptive parents or biological parents. Additionally, the U.S. and Ethiopia have never had any kind of agreement that would outlaw child abduction, in special relation to international adoption. Prior to Ethiopia ceasing its international adoption process, the U.S. attempted to work with Ethiopia to improve the adoption process. In 2007, Ethiopia ranked 5th among countries for international adoption by Americans. This was a large increase from their 16th place ranking in 2000. International adoptions rose after Angelina Jolie's adoption of her daughter Zahara Marley Jolie that took place in 2005. The U.S. embassy to Ethiopia reported that adoption numbers in the country had risen so much that extra staff had to be hired to handle to workload.https://www.brandeis.edu/investigate/adoption/docs/FOIAs/Ethiopia/As%20US%20adoptions%20in%20Ethiopia%20sharply%20increase%20officers%20increase%20outreach%20to%20GOE%20and%20agencies_Addis%20Ababa_March-06.pdf Average waiting time for adoptive parents averaged about five weeks, accompanied by low cost and simple, easy procedures. The high interest found among Americans and Europeans, as well as the cheap and easy adoption process, made the U.S. embassy concerned about adoption fraud. As American laws regarding the practices involved with international adoptions strengthened, adoptions from Ethiopia decreased. Eventually, Ethiopian adoption agencies in the capital of the country, Addis Ababa, began shutting down and going out of business. ===Asia=== According to recent research, certain Asian countries have been top origins of intercountry adoption, namely China, India, The Republic of Korea (South Korea), Vietnam etc. Yet Asian countries have different legal framework towards intercountry adoption. ==== China ==== China and Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) have been party to the Hague Adoption Convention since 1 January 2006. All adoptions in China from another country must meet these requirements as well as Chinese domestic law. On the international level, China also has bilateral agreements with certain countries, including Australia (The Family Law (Bilateral Agreements – Intercountry Adoption) Regulations 1998) etc. Domestically, China has two major legislations directly responsible for international adoption affairs. *Adoption Law of the People's Republic of China (Revised), which deals with general adoption issue. Its Article 21 is specifically linked to international adoption. *Measures for Registration of Adoption of Children by Foreigners in the People's Republic of China, solely addressing international adoption issues. Other pertinent documents include *Article 26 in Marriage Law of the People's Republic of China, also defines adoption in China in a general manner. *Measures of China Center of Adoption Affairs for Authorizing Foreign Adoption Organizations to Seek Adoptive Families for Children of Special Needs Legally, the China Centre for Children's Welfare and Adoptions (CCCWA)CCCWA (which is different from the China Center of Adoption Affairs (CCAA) is the only agency authorized by the Chinese government to regulate and process all inter-country adoptions from China. And China requires all inter-country adoption be handled through government approval instead of any individual application. ====Taiwan==== Having been one of the major sources of adoptive children, yet Taiwan is not party to the Hague Convention on Protection of Children and Co-operation in Respect of Intercountry Adoption (Hague Adoption Convention). Domestically, Taiwan has enforced The Protection of Children and Youths Welfare and Rights Act since May 30, 2012. And according to the Act, all the adoption cases in Taiwan shall consider the national adopter as priority. Besides, all the international adoption cases shall be matched via the legal adoption matching services agency. Except almost the same peer within six degrees of kinship of relatives and five degrees of kinship of relatives by marriage, or one of the couple adopts the other party's children. Taiwan organizations that provide international adoption service work with foreign agency or governmental authority instead of individuals. ====The Republic of Korea (South Korea)==== The Republic of Korea (South Korea) is not party to Hague Adoption Convention. South Korea's law requires the use of an adoption agency for the overseas adoption of all Korean orphans, and requires that such agencies are authorized by The Ministry for Health, Welfare and Family Affairs. On May 24, 2013, it signed the Convention on Protection of Children and Co-operation in Respect of Intercountry Adoption (the Convention). This is the first step for South Korea in becoming a Convention partner. Adoptions between the United States and South Korea, however, are not yet subject to the requirements of the Convention and relevant implementing laws and regulations. According to the Ministry of Health and Welfare, which will be designated as South Korea's Central Authority, there is no set date when South Korea will deliver its instrument of ratification or when the Convention will enter into force with respect to South Korea. Domestically, the Republic of Korea (ROK) Special Adoption Act, which governs intercountry adoptions from South Korea, went into effect on August 5, 2012. This law prioritizes domestic adoptions and endeavors to reduce the number of South Korean children adopted abroad. Under the Special Adoption Act, each intercountry adoption requires the approval of the ROK Family Court. ====India==== India is party to the Hague Convention on Protection of Children and Co-operation in Respect of Intercountry Adoption (Hague Adoption Convention). In January 2011, India implemented new procedures to provide more centralized processing of intercountry adoptions. In addition to the new guidelines, prospective adoptive parents should be aware of all Indian laws that apply to intercountry adoption. A child can be legally placed with the prospective adoptive parents under the Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act of 1956 (HAMA), the Guardians and Wards Act of 1890 (GAWA), or the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act of 2000 (JJA). ====Vietnam==== Vietnam is party to the Hague Convention on Protection of Children and Co- operation in Respect of Intercountry Adoption (Hague Adoption Convention). Domestically, Vietnam Government has promulgated the Law on Adoption and it took effect from January 1, 2011. It contains 53 Articles, and addresses both domestic and intercountry adoption. Article 14 of the Vietnamese law outlines the requirements for adopters, which is also applicable to foreign adoptive parents. ===Europe=== Since the 1970s, European countries such as Spain, France, Italy, and several Scandinavian countries have experienced a considerable increase in the demand for adopted children from non-European countriesSelman P. (2005), \\"Trends in Intercountry Adoption: Analysis of data from 20 Receiving Countries, 1998-2004\\", Journal of Population Research, vol. 23, No. 2/2006, p. 183-204Selman P. (2007) \\"Trends in Intercountry Adoption 1998-2004: A demographic analysis of data from 20 receiving States\\" Journal of Population Research – special issue on \\"Globalisation and Demographic Change\\" as a result of a scarce numbers of national children available for adoptions.Anna Ruzik, \\"Research Note Adoptions in the European Union\\", Centre for Social and Economic Research (CASE) Sienkiewicza, Warsaw, Poland, 2008 Gender studies have also suggested that this is the result of the modern trend in the Global North of delaying conception of the first child, which increases the risk of reduced fertility and the demand for adoption.Reysoo Fenneke, BosPien, N'est pas mère qui veut. Le paradoxe de l'adoption internationale, Nouvelles Questions Féministes, vol. 30 n. 1, 2011 However, recent data show a stabilization or even a decrease in the inter-country adoptions. From one side it has been argued that this is the result of a decrease in the causes of abandonment, implementation of social policies in favour of families, less stigmatization of unmarried mothers, economic development and an increase in the national adoptions in the main source countries. From the other side it has been considered also the result of new regulations and policies adopted by some countries of origin (e.g. Romania)Dickens J (2002) \\"The paradox of inter- country adoption: analysing Romania's experience as a sending country\\", International Journal of Social Welfare, No 11, pp. 76–83 aiming at regulating the outflow of children and preventing child trafficking. The trend however differs from country to country. Between 2000 and 2005, for example Spain, France and Italy have experienced an increase in international adoptions of 70%, while in Switzerland and in Germany they have decreased and in Norway have remained stable. ====Council of Europe==== The enactment and enforcement of international standards and laws regulating adoption depends on how the competent authorities in each contracting state interpret international instruments and implement their provisions. European regulation and practices on the matter vary from country to country. An attempt to harmonize adoption laws among Member States of the Council of Europe was made with the European Convention on the Adoption of Children (1967), which entered into force in April 1968. In 2008 a revised version of the European Convention on the Adoption of Children was prepared by a Working Party of the Committee of Experts on Family Law under the authority of the European Committee on Legal Cooperation within the framework of the Council of Europe. The Convention was opened for signature on 27 November 2008.Explanatory Report, http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/EN/Reports/Html/202.htm As of November 2013, the 1967 Convention has been ratified by 18 of the 46 Member States of the Council of Europe, while 3 Member States are signatories but have not yet ratified. As for the revised Convention, 16 countries have ratified, while another 3 have only signed. The European Convention establishes common principles that should govern adoption. The Convention establishes procedures affecting adoption and its legal consequences to reduce the difficulties in promoting the welfare of the adopted children caused by the differences in legislation and practices among the European States. Among its essential provisions, the Convention stipulates that the adoption must be granted by a competent judicial or administrative authority (art. 4), that birth parents must freely consent to the adoption (art.5) and that the adoption must be in the best interest of the child (art.8). Any improper financial advantages arising from the adoption of a child are prohibited (art.15). ====European Union==== Within the European Union regulation, reference to intercountry adoption is made in article 4 of the Council Directive 2003/86/EC of 22 September 2003 on the right to family reunification. The article regulates the immigration of adoptive third-country-national children provided that the parents are established third country nationals within the European Union. EU Member States authorized the entry and residence of children adopted in accordance with a decision taken by the competent authority of the Member State concerned. Entry can also be authorized by a decision that is automatically enforceable due to international obligations of the Member State or must be recognized in accordance with international obligations (art. 4 (b)). With the ratification and adoption of the Hague Adoption Convention, European countries have developed training for social workers in charge of providing international adoption-related services. They have appointed competent specialists and created a centralized system of control (e.g. Italy and Germany). In Switzerland, on the other hand, the bureaucratization of the procedures has been considered to have slowed down the process resulting in a decrease of the number of children adopted. Traditionally in Spain, France and Switzerland, the adopting parents can choose between two paths to carry out international adoption: referring to the intermediation of an accredited body – most of the time a private organization – and with the supervision of the central adoption authority designated by the state, or opting for a private adoption without the referral to the intermediary. In Italy and Norway the second option, considered as \\"private adoption\\", is forbidden. In Italy for example all international adoptions must be arranged by competent bodies accredited by national law. The only exception is granted to prospective adoptive couples where one spouse is a native of the country the child comes from, or for Italian families who have lived for a long time in the country and have a significant relation with its culture. In these two cases their demand for international adoption can be sent to the International Social Service, an international not-for-profit organization active in more than 100 countries through a network of branches, affiliated bureaus, and correspondents, without recurring to the accredited national bodies.Gore, C., L'Adoption, Armand Colin, 2007 France and Germany recently adopted a third path, creating public bodies that simultaneously exercise a formal intermediary role and in practice perform the functions of a central adoption authority.Communiqué du Conseil des ministres (Paris, 23 mai 2006), www.diplomatie.gouv.fr Data show that in all European countries, both those that legally prohibit and allow for it, the practice of private adoption is widespread and has raised concerns most of all in relation to the risk of child trafficking.Isabelle Lammerant, Marlène Hofstetter, Adoption: at what cost? For an ethical responsibility of receiving countries in intercountry adoption, Terre des homes, 2007, pp. 28–29 Many European countries have signed bilateral agreement with countries of origin of the adopted children (e.g. Spain with Philippines and Bolivia, France with Vietnam). Legally speaking, bilateral agreements cannot disregard the guarantees provided by the Convention of the Rights of the Child and by the Hague Adoption Convention. ===North America=== ====United States==== The United States (US) is bound both by domestic and international laws regarding adoptions of children. The laws cover US families adopting children from abroad, and families abroad adopting US-born children. Many US children are adopted abroad. However, foreign adoptions by American families have dropped in recent years: families in the US adopted 2,971 children from abroad in 2019, compared with a high of 22,884 in 2004.https://apnews.com/article/607d63b84db7621c44019c5e4aaefe27https://travel.state.gov/content/dam/NEWadoptionassets/pdfs/FY%202019%20Annual%20Report%20.pdf There are several international treaties and conventions regulating the intercountry adoption of children. When possible, the US prefers to enter into multilateral agreements over bilateral ones, because of the difficulty in getting the Senate to ratify international agreements. * Inter-American Convention on Conflict of Laws Concerning the Adoption of Minors, 1984 (US not signed or ratified) *US bilateral agreement with Viet Nam on 1 Sept 2005See United States, Government Accountability Office, \\"Foreign affairs: agencies have improved the intercountry adoption process, but further enhancements are needed\\" (Report No. GAO-06-133). Available from http://www.gao.gov/htext/d06133.html (accessed 25 November 2013). *United Nations General Assembly Declaration on Social and Legal Principles Relating to Adoption and Foster Placement of Children Nationally and Internationally (adopted without vote) *Hague Adoption Convention on the Protection of Children and Co-operation in Respect of Inter-Country Adoption (Hague Adoption Convention). The US has acceded to (signed) but the Senate has not ratified the Hague Convention. The US also made a declaration that this convention does not supersede Title 18, United States Code, Section 3190 relating to documents submitted to the United States Government in support of extradition requests. *United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. The US signed (16 Feb 1995) but the Senate has not ratified because of states' rights to execute children (minors tried as adults). This was deemed unconstitutional by Supreme Court in 2005, but the Senate has not reversed its position. The US Department of State lists the pertinent legal documents regarding adoptions. In particular, the Intercountry Adoption Act of 2000 incorporates the Hague Convention into domestic law. The act stipulates requirements for US children being adopted internationally. Paragraph 97.3 (§97.3) stipulates the requirements for a US child being adopted internationally in a country that has also ratified the Hague Convention. A family' eligibility to adopt from another country is fairly similar to the requirements of domestic adoptions, with additions regarding citizenship, visas, and immigration. These are detailed in the booklet Intercountry Adoption from A to Z. The State Department provides interactive maps detailing US adoption rates since 1999 by several categories.http://adoption.state.gov/about_us/statistics.php (Accessed 25 November 2013) ==Reform efforts== Due to the appeal and otherwise obvious difficult issues presented by international adoption, the reform movement seeks to influence governments to adopt regulations that serve the best interest of the child and meet the interests of both the adoptive and biological family members.Adopting Internationally.com Significant advances have been made in increasing the regulation of international adoptions. Adopting families in general have a variety of motivations, including infertility, being a same-sex couple or single parent, and not wanting to contribute to human overpopulation. International adoptions can have additional motivations, including reducing the chance that a biological family member will later challenge the adoption or interfere in the child's life, rescuing a child from a life of poverty (seen by some as patronizing or even neo-colonialist), and \\"saving\\" a child in the religious sense of converting them to the family's religion (not necessarily considered beneficial by those of different religions or no religion). In particular, evangelical Christians have been urged to adopt internationally in addition to having large biological families. International adoption generates additional controversy where the children will be raised in a different culture or religion than they were born into, or by parents of a different ethnicity, especially where this will be visually apparent to others in the society (which may subject the child to stigmatization or discrimination). Some adoptions compensate for problematic attitudes or practices in the source country, such as abandonment of girls and children with disabilities or serious medical problems, or for economic or aesthetic reasons. Considering adoption in the crude terms of a market, the global demand to adopt infants is higher than the naturally available supply; most children available for adoption are of school age. This mismatch encourages international adoption as domestic supply is exhausted, but also creates financial incentives to identify more young children for adoption, especially in developing countries and those with high levels of societal corruption or poor law enforcement. Certain aspects of international adoption make it easier for agencies and child recruiters to commit fraud, including distance, language barriers, difficulty enforcing laws across international boundaries, and adoption agency contracts disclaiming responsibility for incorrect biographical details. Abuses which impact adoption decisions that laws, treaties, and reform efforts are trying to stop include representing a child as an orphan when parents are still alive, representing an orphan child as without family when there are extended family members willing to adopt, representing a child as more impoverished than they actually are, falsely representing a child as having no siblings they would be leaving behind, representing to biological parents that a permanent adoption is actually a program to temporarily send their children to a developed country for educational opportunity, and not disclosing that biological parents were (probably illegally) paid to relinquish custody of their children. ==After a disaster== Of special note to international adoption are campaigns for adoptions that occur after disasters such as hurricanes, tsunamis, and wars. There is often an outpouring of adoption proposals in such cases from foreigners who want to give homes to children left in need. While adoption may be a way to provide stable, loving families for children in need, it is also suggested that adoption in the immediate aftermath of trauma or upheaval may not be the best option.Evan B. Donaldson Adoption Institute Moving children too quickly into new adoptive homes among strangers may be a mistake because it may turn out that the parents survived and were unable to find the children or there may be a relative or neighbor who can offer shelter and homes. Providing safety and emotional support may be better in those situations than immediate relocation to a new adoptive family.The Adoption Board There is an increased risk, immediately following a disaster, that displaced and/or orphaned children may be more vulnerable to exploitation and child trafficking.The Adoption Board == Effects of adoption == Adoption is a dynamic shift on both the adoptive parent(s) and the child. The adoption process is long and arduous to ensure that the living environment will be suitable for the child.However, it can be very overwhelming; many grow up with a total loss of connection to their biological families, culture and roots. According to Child Welfare Information Gateway, \\"The home study process can feel intrusive and may highlight issues that you have not fully addressed.\\" The uncertainty of the whole process, including being able to even adopt a child can be overwhelming. However, the adoption of the child has countless beneficial effects on the child. Adopting a child can provide a stable foundation and family situation that is essential for growth and development, and can provide new opportunities and resources for an adoptive child. It can also give the adoptive parents a sense of purpose and completion. However, the Post-Adoption Period can be mentally and emotionally taxing for both parties. Child Welfare Information Gateway also states, \\"Parents may be unprepared for the issues that may come up throughout the lifelong adoption journey.\\" Unidentified trauma from the adopted child can be hard to pinpoint and treat. Adopted children can also have a fear of rejection and abandonment, which make it hard the parent(s) to connect instantly with the child. This in turn can trigger senses of being let-down, sadness and depression in the parent(s). ==See also== *Effects of adoption on the birth mother *International adoption of South Korean children *List of international adoption scandals ==References== == Further reading == * Rosenberg, Elinor B., The Adoption Life Cycle: the children and their families through the years, New York: Free Press; Toronto: Maxwell Macmillan Canada; New York: Maxwell Macmillan International, 1992. . ==External links== *Hague Conference - Convention of 29 May 1993 on Protection of Children and Co-operation in respect of Intercountry Adoption *David M.

It is situated on the Trotuș River, which flows between the Ciuc and the Tarcău mountains ( of its course pass through Comănești). The town administers two villages, Podei and Vermești. ==History== The area of the town of Comănești has been inhabited since the Neolithic period - Neolithic remains were found in the Vermești area of the town. The name is derived from the Cumans who once ruled the region. Its first written record dates from 1657, and its first presence on a map from the 1696 Sanson Map. From the late 18th century onwards, the town was in the domain of the Ghica family of boyars, who remained an important presence in the area until the middle of the 20th century. The Ghica Palace (now housing the local museum), the park in front of the museum, and the railway stations are testimonies to their presence in the town. During the summers of 2004, 2005, and 2006, Comănești suffered severe flooding of the Trotuș. Some specialists have associated those floods with the deforestation in the area. ==Demographics== The 2011 census counted 19,568 inhabitants. ==Industry== As of 2003, it had an unemployment rate of 18.1%, much higher than the country's average, and the town was declared an underdeveloped region. The town is in the center of a large coal field and there are also smaller amounts of oil in the area. The coal mine, which in 1989 employed 5,000 people, was finally closed down in 2005, leaving the last group of miners (260 in all) unemployed. The other major industry of the town is forestry, but the large lumberyard and factory were also closed; this area of enterprise is now dominated by small local businesses, but in the last few years some international investors started to appear in the city, especially in retail and commerce. There have been new initiatives in recent months to attract investment into the area in both the industrial and tourism sectors. ==See also== * Cuman people ==External links== * Official website * City Hall Official website Category:Populated places in Bacău County Category:Localities in Western Moldavia Category:Towns in Romania Category:Monotowns in Romania Category:Mining communities in Romania Category:Ghica family ","title":"Comănești"},{"id":"1282342","text":"Primary immigration is a term which describes the movement of the earner of a family, or a young unattached single man, from one country to another, usually to improve their economic condition.

See James Branch Cabell The Cream of the Jest, The Lineage of Lichfield: Two Comedies of Evasion (London: Pan/Ballantine, 1972) p. 265. The book follows the earthly career of Dom Manuel the Redeemer from his origins as a swineherd, through his elevation to the rank of Count of Poictesme, to his death. It forms the second volume of Cabell's gigantic Biography of the Life of Manuel. Cabell's working title for Figures of Earth was initially The Fairy Time, then The Figure or The Figures, before the final version emerged.Edward Wagenknecht (ed.) The Letters of James Branch Cabell (Norman: University of Oklahoma Press, 1975) pp. 33-4. The book was published in February 1921, during the legal battle to clear his previous novel, Jurgen, from charges of obscenity. He accordingly dedicated Figures of Earth to \\"six most gallant champions\\" who had rallied to Jurgen's defense: Sinclair Lewis, Wilson Follett, Louis Untermeyer, H. L. Mencken, Hugh Walpole, and Joseph Hergesheimer. The scandal that surrounded Cabell's name at this time may have adversely affected reviews of Figures of Earth, which, according to the author, registered \\"some disappointment over its lack of indecency\\"; he himself preferred Figures of Earth to Jurgen.Edward Wagenknecht (ed.) The Letters of James Branch Cabell (Norman: University of Oklahoma Press, 1975) pp. 137, 251. In the \\"Author's Note\\" preceding the novel's 1927 reprint, Cabell observed that \\"Not many other volumes, I believe, have been burlesqued and cried down in the public prints by their own dedicatees\\"Figures of Earth (1927 edition), Author's Note. alluding to the fact that both Untermeyer and Mencken had publicly expressed dislike with the novel in comparison with Jurgen. A 1925 reissue included illustrations by Frank C. Papé. In Cabell's later years Figures of Earth fell, like most of his other works, into comparative neglect, but two paperback reissues in 1969 and 1971, with introductions by Lin Carter and James Blish respectively, brought it back into circulation. ==Reception== The New York Times, reviewing Figures of Earth, declared that \\"This new novel is, very much of it, beautifully written. Its characters share with the majority of his creations the curiously unhuman quality which is never more apparent than when he is trying to make them quite commonplace. . . . It is a curious, often very beautiful, and at the bottom very sad book.\\"New York Times, March 6, 1921, Book Review & Magazine, \\"Latest Works of Fiction\\". On Cabell's death in 1958, Edmund Wilson wrote \\"the more I have thought about Figures of Earth -- and its sequel The Silver Stallion -- the more remarkable they have come to seem. . . . [T]he chronicle of Manuel the Redeemer was not a book for the Young nor was it a book in the mood of the twenties. The story of the ambitious man of action who is cowardly, malignant and treacherous and who does not even enjoy very much what his crimes and double-dealing have won him, but who is rapidly, after his death, transformed into a great leader, a public benefactor and a saint, has the fatal disadvantage for a novel that the reader finds no inducement to identify himself with its central figure. Yet I am now not sure that this merciless chronicle in which all the values are negative except the naked human will, is not one of the best things of its kind in literature -- on a plane, perhaps, with Flaubert and Swift.\\"The Bit Between My Teeth, Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 1966, p. 322-3 E.

F. (1983). The Guide to Supernatural Fiction. Kent, Ohio: Kent State UP. p. 96-7.

Neo-Luddism is a leaderless movement of non- affiliated groups who resist modern technologies and dictate a return of some or all technologies to a more primitive level.Sale, Kirkpatrick, America’s new Luddites. URL=http://mondediplo.com/1997/02/20luddites Neo-Luddites are characterized by one or more of the following practices: passively abandoning the use of technology, harming those who produce technology harmful to the environment, advocating simple living, or sabotaging technology. The modern neo-Luddite movement has connections with the anti-globalization movement, anti-science movement, anarcho-primitivism, radical environmentalism, and deep ecology. Neo-Luddism is based on the concern of the technological impact on individuals, their communities, and/or the environment, Neo-Luddism stipulates the use of the precautionary principle for all new technologies, insisting that technologies be proven safe before adoption, due to the unknown effects that new technologies might inspire. ==Philosophy== Neo-Luddism calls for slowing or stopping the development of new technologies. Neo-Luddism prescribes a lifestyle that abandons specific technologies, because of its belief that this is the best prospect for the future. As Robin and Webster put it, \\"a return to nature and what are imagined as more natural communities.\\" In the place of industrial capitalism, neo-Luddism prescribes small-scale agricultural communities such as those of the Amish and the Chipko movement in Nepal and India as models for the future. Neo-Luddism denies the ability of any new technology to solve current problems, such as environmental degradation, nuclear warfare and biological weapons, without creating more, potentially dangerous problems.Huesemann, Michael H., and Joyce A. Huesemann (2011). Technofix: Why Technology Won’t Save Us or the Environment, New Society Publishers, Gabriola Island, British Columbia, Canada, , 464 pp. Neo- Luddites are generally opposed to anthropocentrism, globalization and industrial capitalism. In 1990, attempting to reclaim the term 'Luddite' and found a unified movement, Chellis Glendinning published her \\"Notes towards a Neo-Luddite manifesto\\". In this paper, Glendinning describes neo-Luddites as \\"20th century citizens—activists, workers, neighbors, social critics, and scholars—who question the predominant modern worldview, which preaches that unbridled technology represents progress.\\"Glendinning, Chellis. Notes towards a Neo-Luddite manifesto. Utne Reader, 1990. Glendinning voices an opposition to technologies that she deems destructive to communities or are materialistic and rationalistic. She proposes that technology encourages biases, and therefore should question if technologies have been created for specific interests, to perpetuate their specific values including short-term efficiency, ease of production and marketing, as well as profit. Glendinning also says that secondary aspects of technology, including social, economic and ecological implications, and not personal benefit need to be considered before adoption of technology into the technological system. ===Vision of the future without intervention=== Neo-Luddism often establishes stark predictions about the effect of new technologies. Although there is not a cohesive vision of the ramifications of technology, neo-Luddism predicts that a future without technological reform has dire consequences. Neo-Luddites believe that current technologies are a threat to humanity and to the natural world in general, and that a future societal collapse is possible or even probable. Neo-Luddite Ted Kaczynski predicted a world with a depleted environment, an increase in psychological disorders, with either \\"leftists\\" who aim to control humanity through technology, or technology directly controlling humanity. According to Sale, \\"The industrial civilization so well served by its potent technologies cannot last, and will not last; its collapse is certain within not more than a few decades.\\". Stephen Hawking, a famous astrophysicist, predicted that the means of production will be controlled by the \\"machine owner\\" class and that without redistribution of wealth, technology will create more economic inequality.Stephen Hawking Says We Should Really, 2016  http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/stephen-hawking-capitalism- robots_us_5616c20ce4b0dbb8000d9f15 These predictions include changes in humanity's place in the future due to replacement of humans by computers, genetic decay of humans due to lack of natural selection, biological engineering of humans, misuse of technological power including disasters caused by genetically modified organisms, nuclear warfare, and biological weapons; control of humanity using surveillance, propaganda, pharmacological control, and psychological control; humanity failing to adapt to the future manifesting as an increase in psychological disorders, widening economic and political inequality, widespread social alienation, a loss of community, and massive unemployment; technology causing environmental degradation due to shortsightedness, overpopulation, and overcrowding.Theodore J. Kaczynski, David Skrbina; Technological Slavery, The Collected Writings of Theodore J. Kaczynski, a.k.a. \\"The Unabomber.\\" ===Types of intervention=== In 1990, attempting to reclaim the term 'Luddite' and found a unified movement, Chellis Glendinning published her \\"Notes towards a Neo-Luddite manifesto\\". In this paper, Glendinning proposes destroying the following technologies: electromagnetic technologies (this includes communications, computers, appliances, and refrigeration), chemical technologies (this includes synthetic materials and medicine), nuclear technologies (this includes weapons and power as well as cancer treatment, sterilization, and smoke detection), genetic engineering (this includes crops as well as insulin production). She argues in favor of the \\"search for new technological forms\\" which are local in scale and promote social and political freedom. U.C. Berkeley, 1968alt=A man in a suit faces the camera while he stands in front of a building. In \\"The coming revolution\\", Kaczynski outlined what he saw as changes humanity will have to make in order to make society functional, \\"new values that will free them from the yoke of the present technoindustrial system\\", including: * Rejection of all modern technology – \\"This is logically necessary, because modern technology is a whole in which all parts are interconnected; you can’t get rid of the bad parts without also giving up those parts that seem good.\\" * Rejection of civilization itself * Rejection of materialism and its replacement with a conception of life that values moderation and self- sufficiency while deprecating the acquisition of property or of status. * Love and reverence toward nature or even worship of nature * Exaltation of freedom * Punishment of those responsible for the present situation. \\"Scientists, engineers, corporation executives, politicians, and so forth to make the cost of improving technology too great for anyone to try\\" ==Movement== Contemporary neo-Luddites are a widely diverse group of loosely affiliated or non- affiliated groups which includes \\"writers, academics, students, families, Amish, Mennonites, Quakers, environmentalists, \\"fallen-away yuppies,\\" \\"ageing flower children\\" and \\"young idealists seeking a technology-free environment.\\"Doresa Banning, Modern Day Luddites, November 30, 2001, URL=http://www.jour.unr.edu/j705/RP.BANNING.LUDDITE.HTML Some Luddites see themselves as victims of technology trying to prevent further victimization (such as Citizens Against Pesticide Misuse and Parents Against Underage Smartphones). Others see themselves as advocates for the natural order and resist environmental degradation by technology (such as Earth First!). One neo-Luddite assembly was the \\"Second Neo-Luddite Congress\\", held April 13–15, 1996, at a Quaker meeting hall in Barnesville, Ohio. On February 24, 2001, the \\"Teach-In on Technology and Globalization\\" was held at Hunter College in New York city with the purpose to bring together critics of technology and globalization. The two figures who are seen as the movement's founders are Chellis Glendinning and Kirkpatrick Sale. Prominent neo-Luddites include educator S. D. George, ecologist Stephanie Mills, Theodore Roszak, Scott Savage, Clifford Stoll, Bill McKibben, Neil Postman, Wendell Berry, Alan Marshall and Gene Logsdon. Postman, however, did not consider himself a Luddite and loathed being associated with the term. ===Relationship to violence and vandalism=== Some neo-Luddites use vandalism and or violence to achieve social change and promote their cause. In May 2012, credit for the shooting of Roberto Adinolfi, an Ansaldo Nucleare executive, was claimed by an anarchist group who targeted him for stating that none of the deaths following the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami were caused by the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster itself: > Adinolfi knows well that it is only a matter of time before a European > Fukushima kills on our continent [...] Science in centuries past promised us > a golden age, but it is pushing us towards self destruction and slavery > [...] With our action we give back to you a small part of the suffering that > you scientists are bringing to the world. Kaczynski, also known as the Unabomber, initially sabotaged developments near his cabin but dedicated himself to getting back at the system after discovering a road had been built over a plateau he had considered beautiful. Between 1978 and 1995, Kaczynski engaged in a nationwide bombing campaign against modern technology, planting or mailing numerous home-made bombs, killing three people and injuring 23 others. In his 1995 manifesto, Industrial Society and Its Future, Kaczynski states: > The kind of revolution we have in mind will not necessarily involve an armed > uprising against any government. It may or may not involve physical > violence, but it will not be a POLITICAL revolution. Its focus will be on > technology and economics, not politics. In August 2011 in Mexico a group or person calling itself Individuals Tending Towards the Wild perpetrated an attack with a bomb at the Monterrey Institute of Technology and Higher Education, State of Mexico Campus, intended for the coordinator of its Business Development Center and Technology Transfer. The attack was accompanied by the publication of a manifesto criticizing nanotechnology and computer science. Sale says that neo-Luddites are not motivated to commit violence or vandalism.Interview with the Luddite, Wired magazine, Issue 3.06, Jun 1995. URL=https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/3.06/saleskelly.html The manifesto of the 'Second Luddite Congress', which Sale took a major part in defining, attempts to redefine neo-Luddites as people who reject violent action. ==History== ===Origins of contemporary critiques of technology in literature=== According to Julian Young, Martin Heidegger was a Luddite in his early philosophical phase and believed in the destruction of modern technology and a return to an earlier agrarian world.Young, Julian. Heidegger's Later Philosophy, p. 80. Cambridge University Press, 2002. However, the later Heidegger did not see technology as wholly negative and did not call for its abandonment or destruction. In The Question Concerning Technology (1953), Heidegger posited that the modern technological \\"mode of Being\\" was one which viewed the natural world, plants, animals, and even human beings as a \\"standing-reserve\\"—resources to be exploited as means to an end.Wheeler, Michael, \\"Martin Heidegger\\", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Spring 2013 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL = . To illustrate this \\"monstrousness\\", Heidegger uses the example of a hydroelectric plant on the Rhine river which turns the river from an unspoiled natural wonder to just a supplier of hydropower. In this sense, technology is not just the collection of tools, but a way of being in the world and of understanding the world which is instrumental and grotesque. According to Heidegger, this way of being defines the modern way of living in the West. For Heidegger, this technological process ends up reducing beings to not-beings, which Heidegger calls 'the abandonment of being' and involves the loss of any sense of awe and wonder, as well as an indifference to that loss. One of the first major contemporary anti-technological thinkers was French philosopher Jacques Ellul. In his The Technological Society (1964), Ellul argued that the rationality of technology enforces logical and mechanical organization which \\"eliminates or subordinates the natural world.\\" Ellul defined technique as the entire totality of organizational methods and technology with a goal toward maximum rational efficiency. According to Ellul, technique has an impetus which tends to drown out human concerns: \\"The only thing that matters technically is yield, production. This is the law of technique; this yield can only be obtained by the total mobilization of human beings, body and soul, and this implies the exploitation of all human psychic forces.\\"Ellul, The Technological Society p. 324 In Industrial Revolution England machines became cheaper to use than to employee men. The five counties of Yorkshire, Lancashire, Cheshire, Derbyshire, and Nottinghamshire had a small uprising where they threatened those hired to guard the machines. Another critic of political and technological expansion was Lewis Mumford, who wrote The Myth of the Machine. The views of Ellul influenced the ideas of the infamous American Neo-Luddite Kaczynski. The opening of Kaczynski's manifesto reads: \\"The Industrial Revolution and its consequences have been a disaster for the human race.\\"The Washington Post: Unabomber Special Report: Industrial Society and Its Future by Theodore Kaczynski Other philosophers of technology who have questioned the validity of technological progress include Albert Borgmann, Don Ihde and Hubert Dreyfus.Basney, Lionel.

Arnstadt is one of the oldest towns in Thuringia, and has a well-preserved historic centre with a partially preserved town wall. The town is nicknamed Das Tor zum Thüringer Wald (\\"The Gateway to the Thuringian Forest\\") because of its location on the northern edge of that forest. Arnstadt has a population of some 27,000. The city centre is on the west side of Gera. The municipality has absorbed several neighbouring municipalities: Angelhausen–Oberndorf (1922), Siegelbach (1994), Rudisleben (1999) and Wipfratal (2019). The neighbouring municipalities are Amt Wachsenburg, Alkersleben, Dornheim, Bösleben- Wüllersleben, Stadtilm, Ilmenau, Plaue and Geratal. ==History== A deed of gift issued 1 May 704 in Würzburg by the Thuringian Duke Hedan II to the Anglo- Saxon bishop Willibrord of Utrecht is the first written reference to Arnstadt (\\"Arnestati\\"), along with two other towns—the oldest documented reference of settlements in Thuringia and central and eastern Germany.Georg Heinrich Pertz u. a. (Hrsg.): Scriptores (in Folio) 23: Chronica aevi Suevici. Hannover 1874, S. 55–56 (Monumenta Germaniae Historica, Digitalisat) In 726, Arnstadt passed to the Abbey of Echternach, and later to the Abbey of Hersfeld. According to historian August Beck, in 925 the territories of Henry I were extended as a bulwark against the invading Magyars.August Beck: Geschichte des gothaischen Landes, Vol. I, Gotha, 1868, S. 31. On 17 December 954, Holy Roman Emperor Otto I made peace in Arnstadt with his rebellious son Liudolf of Swabia and another son, William, whom he appointed Archbishop of Mainz, and decided that the Liebfrauenkirche (Church of our Lady) would be built. In the 12th century a part of Arnstadt fell under the rule of the Counts of Kevernburg. On 8 March 1198 the princes of the Holy Roman Empire gathered in Arnstadt and elected Philip of Swabia as King of Germany. In 1220 Arnstadt was first described as a civitas, that is, a city. On 21 April 1266, the abbot of the Abbey of Hersfeld granted a charter; thereafter, Arnstadt became a hub for trade in timber, grain, wine and wood. After the extinction of the Kevernburg family from 1302 to 1306, the counts of Schwarzburg took possession of Arnstadt. Attempts by Erfurt 1342 and 1345 to seize what was now a wealthy town failed due to the strong attachment. Arnstadt's prosperity was based on the milling industry, the cloth-making trade, tanneries, and trade in wine, woad, wood, grain, wool, and vegetables. On 30 January 1349, Count Günther XXI of Schwarzburg, an adversary of King Charles IV, was elected and crowned sovereign of Arnstadt in Frankfurt. He renounced this title on 26 May for 20,000 silver marks. A 1404 reference was found in 2000 to Bratwurst originating in Arnstadt, therefore the town claims its invention. In 1496, the Schwarzburg domains were divided into the lordships of Schwarzburg-Rudolstadt and Schwarzburg-Sondershausen, to which Arnstadt belonged. During the German Peasants' War 95 participants in the uprising were beheaded as ringleaders in the Arnstadt marketplace, on 17 June and 2 August 1525. The city was forced to pay 3000 guilders for supporting the insurgents. In 1531 the Reformation was introduced into Arnstadt. As a result, the Franciscan maidens' convent, and subsequently the Franciscan mendicant convent (Barfüßerkloster) were secularized. From 1581 the church of the former Barfüßerkloster (now the Oberkirche) was the main church of the city. In 1553, work began on the count's residence, Neideck Castle. The water palace was completed in 1560. With the onset of industrialisation, a residential area emerged to the west and south of the old town, and industrial areas to the north. During the Second World War, it was the site of a prisoner-of-war camp, mainly for Poles and Russians. 1,700 prisoners were housed in tents that contained only 100 bunks. The camp was liberated by American Forces in April 1945. A number of mass graves were discovered. 1,200 civilians from the neighbouring city of Weimar were brought on a forced tour of the camp. This included a \\"parchment display\\" which displayed a \\"lampshade made of human skin.\\" The display also included pieces of skin used for painting pictures.Nazi Concentration Camps American army documentary produced and presented as evidence at the Nuremberg war crimes trial of Hermann Göring and twenty other Nazi leaders. After the Second World War, the town expanded further to the north along the Geratals, new residential areas emerged in the 1970s and 80s, in the east and southeast of Arnstadt, including the residential Raven Hold. Arnstadt is a manufacturing centre with glassworks and foundries, a solar panel production plant, and glove-manufacturing and wood- finishing businesses. ==Main sights== The restored Wender organ in the Bachkirche Arnstadt has a beautifully kept old city, restricted to pedestrian traffic. Its noteworthy buildings include: * the 13th-century Church of Our Lady * an 18th-century palace * the Bach Church (formerly the New Church) The composer Johann Sebastian Bach, whose family lived for generations in the vicinity of Arnstadt, became the organist at the New Church in 1703 while he was still in his teens. He stayed there until 1707. Bach had a high opinion of Johann Friedrich Wender, the organ-builder who had recently constructed the church's organ. While there is some uncertainty about which of his surviving compositions were produced in Arnstadt, there is evidence that the Wender organ, which still survives, allowed Bach to experiment with unusual modulations and harmonies. Many Bach scholars believe his well-known \\"Toccata and Fugue in D Minor\\" was composed with the Arnstadt organ in mind. ==Miscellaneous== The annual precipitation averages 487 mm. The town hosts an annual high jump meet – Hochsprung mit Musik – which attracts some of the world's foremost high jumpers.

She was the first female opposition leader in the province's history. ==Early life== Born in Edmonton, Alberta, MacBeth received a Bachelor of Arts at the University of Alberta, in French and Russian; studying Université Laval, studying French Canadian literature. She subsequently worked as an executive assistant for several Alberta cabinet ministers. ==Early political career== MacBeth, then known as Nancy Betkowski, first entered electoral politics as an Alberta Progressive Conservative Party Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) for the riding of Edmonton-Glenora from 1986 to 1993 in the government of Don Getty. She was Minister of Education from 1986 to 1988, and was then appointed Minister of Health, serving in that position until 1992. She then ran as a candidate in the party's 1992 leadership convention against Ralph Klein. Regarded by the membership as a Red Tory, Betkowski became the preferred candidate of the party establishment. However, Klein's populist appeal won him the leadership, and Betkowski did not stand as a candidate in the 1993 election. ==Liberal leader== She subsequently married portfolio manager and financial writer Hilliard MacBeth. She then returned to politics in 1998, running for the leadership of the Alberta Liberals after the resignation of Grant Mitchell. Now serving as the MLA for Edmonton-McClung, MacBeth tried to capitalize on discontent with Klein's government in some Alberta communities by reaching out to disaffected Red Tories, but proved unable to connect with voters. In the 2001 provincial election, the Liberals won only seven seats, less than half as many as they had held before the election. Among the losses was MacBeth's own seat of Edmonton-McClung. The election left the party a million dollar debt that took about 10 years to pay off. She subsequently left politics again, and was succeeded by Ken Nicol as party leader. ==References== Category:1948 births Category:Alberta Liberal Party MLAs Category:Female Canadian political party leaders Category:Leaders of the Alberta Liberal Party Category:Living people Category:Members of the Executive Council of Alberta Category:Politicians from Edmonton Category:Progressive Conservative Association of Alberta MLAs Category:Women MLAs in Alberta Category:Women government ministers of Canada ","title":"Nancy MacBeth"},{"id":"1282354","text":"Launched is the second album from German hardcore punk band, Beatsteaks.

Underpinning may be necessary for a variety of reasons: * The original foundation isn't strong or stable enough. * The usage of the structure has changed. * The properties of the soil supporting the foundation may have changed (possibly through subsidence) or were mischaracterized during design. * The construction of nearby structures necessitates the excavation of soil supporting existing foundations. * To increase the depth or load capacity of existing foundations to support the addition of another storey to the building (above or below grade). * It is more economical, due to land price or otherwise, to work on the present structure's foundation than to build a new one. * Earthquake, flood, drought or other natural causes have caused the structure to move, requiring stabilisation of foundation soils and/or footings. Underpinning may be accomplished by extending the foundation in depth or breadth so it either rests on a more supportive soil stratum or distributes its load across a greater area. Use of micropiles and jet grouting are common methods in underpinning. An alternative to underpinning is the strengthening of the soil by the introduction of a grout, including expanding urethane-based engineered structural resins. Underpinning may be necessary where P class (problem) soils in certain areas of the site are encountered. Through semantic change the word underpinning has evolved to encompass all abstract concepts that serve as a foundation. ==Mass concrete underpinning== 'Traditional underpinning,' the mass concrete underpinning method is nearly 100 years in age, and the protocol has not changed. This underpinning method strengthens an existing structure's foundation by digging boxes by hand underneath and sequentially pouring concrete in a strategic order. The result is a foundation built underneath the existing foundation. This underpinning method is generally applied when the existing foundation is at a shallow depth, but works well up to fifty feet (fifteen meters) deep. The method has not changed since its inception with its use of utilitarian tools such as shovels and post hole diggers. Heavy machinery is not employed in this method due to the small size of the boxes being dug. There are several advantages to using this method of underpinning, including the simplicity of the engineering, the low cost of labor, and the continuity of the structure's use during construction. This method of underpinning requires the digging holes underneath the existing foundation. Digging will be performed in sequence and will be followed by filling these with concrete, accompanied by reinforcements if the situation so demands. The work is done by hand where there will be no need for heavy excavation equipment, provided the project specifics demands so. ==Beam and base underpinning== The beam and base method of underpinning is a more technically advanced adaptation of traditional mass concrete underpinning. A reinforced concrete beam is constructed below, above or in replacement of the existing footing. The beam then transfers the load of the building to mass concrete bases, which are constructed at designed strategic locations. Base sizes and depths are dependent upon the prevailing ground conditions. Beam design is dependent upon the configuration of the building and the applied loads. Anti- heave precautions are often incorporated in schemes where potential expansion of clay soils may occur. ==Mini-piled underpinning== Mini-piles have the greatest use where ground conditions are variable, where access is restrictive, where environmental pollution aspects are significant, and where structural movements in service must be minimal. Mini-piled underpinning is generally used when the loads from the foundations need to be transferred to stable soils at considerable depths – usually in excess of . Mini-piles may either be augured or driven steel cased, and are normally between and in diameter. Structural engineers will use rigs which are specifically designed to operate in environments with restricted headroom and limited space, and can gain access through a regular domestic doorway. They are capable of constructing piles to depths of up to . The technique of minipiling was first applied in Italy in 1952, and has gone through many different names, reflecting worldwide acceptance and expiration of the original patents. The relatively small diameter of mini-piles is distinctive of this type of underpinning and generally uses anchoring or tie backs into an existing structure or rock. Conventional drilling and grouting methods are used for this method of underpinning. These mini-piles have a high slenderness ratio, feature substantial steel reinforcing elements and can sustain axial loading in both senses. The working loads of mini-piles can sustain up to loads. In comparison to Mass Concrete Underpinning, the engineering aspect of mini- piles is somewhat more involved, including rudimentary engineering mechanics such as statics and strength of materials. These mini-piles must be designed to work in tension and compression, depending on the orientation and application of the design. In detail, attention with design must be paid analytically to settlement, bursting, buckling, cracking, and interface consideration, whereas, from a practical viewpoint, corrosion resistance, and compatibility with the existing ground and structure must be regarded. ==Mini- piled underpinning schemes== Mini-piled underpinning schemes include pile and beam, cantilever pile-caps and piled raft systems. Cantilevered pile-caps are usually used to avoid disturbing the inside of a building, and require the construction of tension and compression piles to each cap. These are normally linked by a beam. The pile and beam system usually involves constructing pairs of piles on either side of the wall and linking them with a pile cap to support the wall. The pile caps are usually linked by reinforced concrete beams to support the entire length of the wall. Piled raft underpinning systems are commonly used when an entire building needs to be underpinned. The internal floors are completely removed, a grid of piles is installed, and a reinforced concrete raft is then constructed over the complete floor level, picking up and fully supporting all external and internal walls. ==An alternative to underpinning by expanding resin injection== A mix of structural resins and hardener is injected into foundation ground beneath footings. On entering the ground the resin and hardener mix and expansion occurs due to a chemical reaction. The expanding structural resin mix fills any voids and crevices, compacts any weak soil and then, if the injection is continued, the structure above may be raised and re-levelled. This relatively new method of underpinning has been in existence for approximately 30 years, and because it does not involve any construction or excavation set-up, is known to be a clean, fast and non-disruptive underpinning method. ==Gallery== File:Cantilever-needle-beam.pngSketch of a cast in situ RC cantilever needle beam on micro piers or piles.

It published comics related to the animated television series The Simpsons and Futurama, as well as the SpongeBob SquarePants comic, along with original material. It was named after Bongo, a rabbit character in Groening's comic strip Life in Hell. Bongo has, at some time in its history, printed Simpsons Comics, Simpsons Comics and Stories, Futurama Comics, Krusty Comics, Lisa Comics, Bart Simpson, Bartman, Itchy & Scratchy Comics and Radioactive Man. Zongo Comics, also created by Groening, was Bongo Comics' counterpart geared towards niche audiences. ==History== The original Bongo Comics logo. Groening launched Bongo Comics Group in 1993, perceiving a lack of funny books in the comic book industry at the time: \\"I go into comic book stores and look at all the stuff, and, for the most part, it looks like fairly grim science-fiction and superhero stuff ... I guess I just thought there was room out there for funny comic books.\\" The company launched four titles, the bi-monthly Simpsons Comics and Radioactive Man Vol. 1, and the thrice-annually Itchy & Scratchy Comics and Bartman. Groening hoped that the new company would revitalise the industry, and held discussions to publish cross-overs with characters from other publishing companies. The comics use original story-lines rather than simply adapting episodes of the television series; however, in 2011 editor Bill Morrison explained that the stories \\"fit in with the continuity of the shows.\\" The company launched Futurama Comics, based on the cartoon series of the same name, in 2000. 2012 saw the company change their logo, and a new creative director was unveiled, with Nathan Kane promoted internally to replace the departing Bill Morrison. It was announced at San Diego Comic Con in July 2018 that Bongo would be shutting down in October.

Pielke Jr. (born November 2, 1968) is an American political scientist and professor, and was the director of the Sports Governance Center within the Department of Athletics at the Center for Science and Technology Policy Research at the University of Colorado Boulder. He previously served in the Environmental Studies Program and was a Fellow of the Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences (CIRES) where he served as Director of the Center for Science and Technology Policy Research at the University of Colorado Boulder from 2001 to 2007. Pielke was a visiting scholar at Oxford University's Saïd Business School in the 2007-2008 academic year. A prolific writer, his interests include understanding the politicization of science; decision making under uncertainty; policy education for scientists in areas such as climate change, disaster mitigation, and world trade; and research on the governance of sports organizations, including FIFA and the NCAA. == Education and background == Pielke earned a B.A. in mathematics (1990), an M.A. in public policy (1992), and a Ph.D. in political science, all from the University of Colorado Boulder. Prior to his positions at CU-Boulder, from 1993 to 2001 he was a staff scientist in the Environmental and Societal Impacts Group of the National Center for Atmospheric Research. From 2002 to 2004 Pielke was Director of Graduate Studies for the CU-Boulder Graduate Program in Environmental Studies and in 2001 students selected him for the Outstanding Graduate Advisor Award. Pielke serves on numerous editorial boards and advisory committees, retains many professional affiliations, and sat on the Board of Directors of WeatherData, Inc. from 2001 to 2006. In 2012 he was awarded an honorary doctorate by Linköping University and the Public Service Award of the Geological Society of America. == Professional writing == Pielke's early work was on the Space Shuttle program. In 1993 he argued that the shuttle was expensive and risky — that it was \\"probable\\" that another orbiter would be lost within 20-35 flights. Shortly before the loss of Columbia he warned that loss of another shuttle was only a matter of time. He has also been critical of the space station program. Pielke has also written extensively on climate change policy. He has written that he accepts the IPCC view of the underlying science, stating, \\"The IPCC has concluded that greenhouse gas emissions resulting from human activity are an important driver of changes in climate. And on this basis alone I am personally convinced that it makes sense to take action to limit greenhouse gas emissions.\\" He also states that, \\"Any conceivable emissions reductions policies, even if successful, cannot have a perceptible impact on the climate for many decades\\", and from this he concludes that, \\"In coming decades the only policies that can effectively be used to manage the immediate effects of climate variability and change will be adaptive.\\" On the issues of hurricanes and climate change he has argued that the trend in increasing damage from hurricanes is primarily due to societal and economic factors (chiefly an increase in wealth density), rather than change in the frequency and intensity. A \\"Guide to Climate Skeptics\\" published by Foreign Policy notes that Pielke's published views have led to him being considered by some a \\"denier\\" of climate change and by others as an \\"alarmist\\". His views on the IPCC consensus on climate change have been widely criticized by scientists, including former US presidential science adviser John Holdren. In October 2016, in a hacked email disclosed by WikiLeaks, Judd Legum states that a ThinkProgress blog was instrumental in his firing from the FiveThirtyEight website.Legum wrote: “I think it’s fair say that, without Climate Progress, Pielke would still be writing on climate change for 538”.

Pielke was named in a letter sent by Representative Raúl Grijalva (D-AZ) to institutions that employed scientists who had testified to Congress about climate change. The letter stated, \\"My colleagues and I cannot perform our duties if research or testimony provided to us is influenced by undisclosed financial relationships,\\" and requested information including the sources and amounts of outside funding for those scientists who had testified.

Pielke Sr. (born October 22, 1946) is an American meteorologist with interests in climate variability and climate change, environmental vulnerability, numerical modeling, atmospheric dynamics, land/ocean – atmosphere interactions, and large eddy/turbulent boundary layer modeling. He particularly focuses on mesoscale weather and climate processes but also investigates on the global, regional, and microscale. Pielke is an ISI Highly Cited Researcher.List of highly cited researchers with last names beginning with P == Background == Pielke was awarded a B.A. in mathematics at Towson State College in 1968, and then an M.S. and Ph.D. in meteorology at Pennsylvania State University (PSU) in 1969 and 1973, respectively. From 1971 to 1974 he worked as a research scientist at the NOAA Experimental Meteorology Lab (EML), from 1974 to 1981 he was an associate professor at the University of Virginia (UVa), served the primary academic position of his career as a professor at Colorado State University (CSU) from 1981 to 2006, was deputy of Cooperative Institute for Research in the Atmosphere (CIRA) at Colorado State University from 1985 to 1988, from 1999 to 2006 was Colorado State Climatologist, at Duke University was a research professor from 2003 to 2006, and was a visiting professor at the University of Arizona from October–December 2004. Since 2005, Pielke has served as Senior Research Scientist at the Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences (CIRES) at CU-Boulder and an emeritus professor of the Department of Atmospheric Science at CSU. After retiring from CSU and he remains a CIRES emeritus researcher. Pielke spearheaded development of the Regional Atmospheric Modeling System (RAMS) with William R. Cotton. Pielke has served as Chairman and Member of the American Meteorological Society Committee on Weather Forecasting and Analysis, as Chief Editor of Monthly Weather Review, was elected a Fellow of the American Meteorological Society (AMS) in 1982 and a Fellow of the American Geophysical Union (AGU) in 2004, has served as Editor-in-Chief of the U.S. National Science Report to the International Union of Geodesy and Geophysics, as Co-Chief Editor of the Journal of the Atmospheric Sciences, and as Editor of Scientific Online Letters on the Atmosphere. == On climate change == In 2007 Pielke said that he was not a \\"sceptical scientist\\" about climate change, having stated that carbon dioxide, while important, is not the predominant forcing of global warming: : As I have summarized on the Climate Science weblog, humans activities do significantly alter the heat content of the climate system, although, based on the latest understanding, the radiative effect of CO2 has contributed, at most, only about 28% to the human-caused warming up to the present. The other 72% is still a result of human activities! Pielke has criticized the IPCC for its conclusions regarding CO2 and global warming and accused it of selectively choosing data to support a selective view of the science. In 2010 Pielke revisited a question provided by Andrew Revkin \\"Is most of the observed warming over the last 50 years likely to have been due to the increase in greenhouse gas concentrations\\", Pielke stated that \\"the 2010 answer ... remains NO\\", and that \\"The added greenhouse gases from human activity clearly have a role in increasing the heat content of the climate system from what it otherwise would be\\", but \\"there are other equally or even more important significant human climate forcings\\" and furthermore \\"We now know, however, that the natural variations of atmospheric and ocean circulation features within the climate system produces global average heat changes that are substantially larger than what was known in 2005. The IPCC models have failed to adequately simulate this effect.\\" ==Family== Pielke is married. He has two children. His son Roger A. Pielke Jr. is a political scientist and works in the field of climate policy. == Publications == Pielke has published more than 300 scientific papers, 50 chapters in books, and co-edited 9 books.

This program grew from a minor part of the social security system to a significant system of welfare administered by the states with federal funding. However, it was criticized for offering incentives for women to have children, and for providing disincentives for women to join the workforce. In July 1997, AFDC was replaced by the more restrictive Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program. ==History== The overall decline in welfare monthly benefits (in 2006 dollars)2008 Indicators of Welfare Dependence Figure TANF 2. The program was created under the name Aid to Dependent Children (ADC) by the Social Security Act of 1935 as part of the New Deal. It was created as a means tested entitlement which subsidized the income of families where fathers were \\"deceased, absent, or unable to work\\". It provided a direct payment of $18 per month for one child, and $12 for a second child. In 1994, the average payment was $420/month. [https://socialwelfare.library.vcu.edu/public-welfare/aid-to- dependent-children-the-legal-history/ The federal government required contributions from individual states, and authorized state discretion to determine who received aid and in what amount. ADC was primarily created for white single mothers, who were expected not to work. Black mothers, who had always been in the labor force, were not considered eligible to receive benefits. In 1961 a change in the law permitted states to extend benefits to families where the father was unemployed, a measure which 25 states eventually adopted. The words \\"families with\\" were added to the name in 1962, partly due to concern that the program's rules discouraged marriage. The Civil Rights Movement and the efforts of the National Welfare Rights Organization in the 1960s expanded the scope of welfare entitlements to include black women. The welfare rolls racial demographics changed drastically. The majority of welfare recipients still remained white and most black female recipients continued to work. Starting in 1962, the Department of Health and Human Services allowed state-specific exemptions as long as the change was \\"in the spirit of AFDC\\" in order to allow some experimentation. By 1996 spending was $24 billion per year. When adjusted for inflation, the highest spending was in 1976, which exceeded 1996 spending by about 8%.U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (website) \\"Federal and State Expenditures for AFDC\\" In 1967 the federal government began requiring states to establish the paternity of children eligible for the program, and extended benefits to \\"unemployed male parents with a work history\\". ===Man-in-the-house rule=== A number of states enacted so called \\"man-in-the-house\\" rules, which disqualified families if there was any adult male present in the household whatsoever. As Williams and Hardisty phrased it: > States had wide discretion to determine eligibility and many states > conditioned the receipt of welfare on the sexual morality of the mother, > using \\"suitable home\\" and \\"man in the house\\" rules to disqualify many > African American single mothers. The \\"man-in-the-house\\" rule was struck down in 1968 by the US Supreme Court in King v. Smith. Thereafter, families with males in the household were eligible for benefits if they were not deemed to be actual or substitute parents, although any financial contribution on the part of the male to the family was still considered a part of the family's total income. By 1981, the Supreme Court went further and required that states take into consideration the income earned by step-fathers. ===Thirty-and-a-third rule=== { class=\\" floatright\\" + AFDC caseload - ! Time period ! Growth -  1950-60  7% -  1960-65  24% -  1965-70  125% -  1970-75  29% -  1975-80  3% } The year 1967 saw the establishment of the thirty-and-a-third rule, which allowed families to keep their first $30 earned along with one third of their income following the first $30 without the change affecting their eligibility for benefits. This and other factors lead to a large increase in enrollment. For example, caseloads rose 24% from 1960 to 1965, but rose 126% in the period from 1965 to 1970. ==Criticism== Early in the program, there were concerns about whether it encouraged unwed motherhood. Some advocates complained that the rule had the effect of breaking up marriages and promoting matriarchy: > [T]he AFDC program tended to treat households with a cohabiting male who was > not the natural father of the children much more leniently than those with a > resident spouse or father of the children. This feature created a clear > disincentive for marriage and also a clear incentive for divorce, because > women who married face the reduction or loss of their AFDC benefits. In 1984, libertarian author Charles Murray suggested that welfare causes dependency. He argued that as welfare benefits increased, the number of recipients also increased; this behavior, he said, was rational: there is little reason to work if one can receive benefits for a long period of time without having to work. His later work and that of Richard J. Herrnstein and others suggested possible merit to the theory of a dysgenic effect,Herrnstein, R. J. and Murray, C. (1994).

Tarpley & Anton Chaitkin Chapter 11 ==Reform== In 1996, President Bill Clinton negotiated with the Republican-controlled Congress to pass the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act which drastically restructured the program. Among other changes, a lifetime limit of five years was imposed for the receipt of benefits, and the newly limited nature of the replacement program was reinforced by calling AFDC's successor Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF). Many Americans continue to refer to TANF as \\"welfare\\" or AFDC. TANF has remained controversial. In 2003, LaShawn Y. Warren, an ACLU Legislative Counsel, said that TANF gives states an incentive \\"to deny benefits to those who need it most. The solution to getting people out of the cycle of poverty is not to prematurely kick them off welfare. Too many have been denied aid unfairly, creating a false impression that the number of people who need help has decreased.\\"ACLU Says Current Welfare Reform Measure Ineffective, Calls for Civil Rights Protections, Better Poverty Elimination Efforts (September 10, 2003) In 2006, a The New Republic editorial wrote, \\"A broad consensus now holds that welfare reform was certainly not a disaster—and that it may, in fact, have worked much as its designers had hoped.\\"Fared Well.

It is the second in his series of \\"Christmas books,\\" five novellas with strong social and moral messages that he published during the 1840s. In addition to A Christmas Carol and The Chimes, the Christmas books include The Cricket on the Hearth (1845), The Battle of Life (1846), and The Haunted Man and the Ghost's Bargain (1848). ==Development history== The book was written in late 1844, during Dickens' year-long visit to Italy. John Forster, his first biographer, records that Dickens, hunting for a title and structure for his next contracted Christmas story, was struck one day by the clamour of the Genoese bells audible from the villa where they were staying. Two days later Forster received a letter from Dickens which read simply: \\"\\"We have heard THE CHIMES at midnight, Master Shallow!\\", and the writing of the book began. Forster describes Dickens' intentions in writing The Chimes as striking \\"a blow for the poor\\". Dickens returned to London for a week in December 1844 and gave readings of the finished book to friends prior to publication, to judge its impact. The artist Daniel Maclise, who had contributed two illustrations to The Chimes and attended two of these events, portrayed the reading of 3 December 1844 in a well-known sketch. ==Explanation of the novel's title== The chimes are old bells in the church on whose steps Trotty Veck plies his trade. The book is divided into four parts named \\"quarters\\", after the quarter chimes of a striking clock. (This parallels Dickens naming the parts of A Christmas Carol \\"staves\\" – that is \\"stanzas\\" – and dividing The Cricket on the Hearth into \\"chirps\\".) ==Plot summary== On New Year's Eve, Trotty, a poor elderly \\"ticket-porter\\" or casual messenger, is filled with gloom at the reports of crime and immorality in the newspapers, and wonders whether the working classes are simply wicked by nature. His daughter Meg and her long-time fiancé Richard arrive and announce their decision to marry next day. Trotty hides his misgivings, but their happiness is dispelled by an encounter with the pompous Alderman Cute, plus a political economist and a young gentleman with a nostalgia, all of whom make Trotty, Meg and Richard feel they hardly have a right to exist, let alone marry. Trotty carries a note for Cute to Sir Joseph Bowley MP, who dispenses charity to the poor in the manner of a paternal dictator. Bowley is ostentatiously settling his debts to ensure a clean start to the new year, and berates Trotty because he owes a little rent and ten or twelve shillings to his local shop which he cannot pay off. Returning home, convinced that he and his fellow poor are naturally ungrateful and have no place in society, Trotty encounters Will Fern, a poor countryman, and his orphaned niece, Lilian. Fern has been accused of vagrancy and wants to visit Cute to set matters straight, but from a conversation overheard at Bowley's house, Trotty is able to warn him that Cute plans to have him arrested and imprisoned. He takes the pair home with him and he and Meg share their meagre food and poor lodging with the visitors. Meg tries to hide her distress, but it seems she has been dissuaded from marrying Richard by her encounter with Cute and the others. In the night, the bells seem to call Trotty. Going to the church, he finds the tower door unlocked and climbs to the bellchamber, where he discovers the spirits of the bells and their goblin attendants who reprimand him for losing faith in man's destiny to improve. He is told that he fell from the tower during his climb and is now dead, and Meg's subsequent life must now be an object lesson for him. There follows a series of visions which he is forced to watch, helpless to interfere with the troubled lives of Meg, Richard, Will and Lilian over the subsequent years. Richard descends into alcoholism; Meg eventually marries him in an effort to save him, but he dies ruined, leaving her with a baby. Will is driven in and out of prison by petty laws and restrictions; Lilian turns to prostitution. In the end, destitute, Meg is driven to contemplate drowning herself and her child, thus committing the mortal sins of murder and suicide. The chimes' intention is to teach Trotty that, far from being naturally wicked, mankind is formed to strive for nobler things, and will fall only when crushed and repressed beyond bearing. Trotty breaks down when he sees Meg poised to jump into the river, cries that he has learned his lesson and begs the Chimes to save her, whereupon he finds himself able to touch her and prevent her from jumping. At the end of the book, Trotty finds himself awakening at home as if from a dream as the bells ring in the New Year of the day Trotty originally climbed the tower. Meg and Richard have chosen to wed, and all of her friends have spontaneously chosen to provide a wedding feast and celebration. The author explicitly invites the reader to decide if this \\"awakening\\" is a dream-within-a-dream. The reader must choose between the harsh consequences of the behaviour of the upper classes in Trotty's vision, or the happiness of the wedding. Trotty Veck by Kyd (Joseph Clayton Clarke) ==Main characters== * Toby \\"Trotty\\" Veck, the protagonist, a poor elderly messenger or \\"ticket-porter.\\" * Margaret \\"Meg\\" Veck, Toby's 21-year-old daughter * Mrs. Anne Chickenstalker, the local shopkeeper * Alderman Cute, a Justice of the Peace * Mr. Filer, a political economist in the Utilitarian mould * Sir Joseph Bowley, a rich paternalist MP * Will Fern, a countryman * Lilian Fern, Will's orphaned niece ==Major themes== This is a campaigning story like its predecessor A Christmas Carol, written with the intention of swaying readers towards Dickens' moral message. The chimes represent time, and the main themes of the story are summarised in the three wrongs they accuse Trotty of committing: • Harking back to a golden age that never was, instead of striving to improve conditions here and now. • Believing that individual human joys and sorrows do not matter to a higher power. • Condemning those who are fallen and unfortunate, and offering them neither help nor pity. > 'Who turns his back upon the fallen and disfigured of his kind; abandons > them as vile; and does not trace and track with pitying eyes the unfenced > precipice by which they fell from good—grasping in their fall some tufts and > shreds of that lost soil, and clinging to them still when bruised and dying > in the gulf below; does wrong to Heaven and man, to time and to eternity. > And you have done that wrong!' ==Literary significance and reception== A Christmas Carol had been extremely well received the previous year, and The Chimes aroused public interest and anticipation. Five different stage productions of the book were running within weeks of publication and nearly 20,000 copies were sold in the first three months. It had a high media profile, and was widely reviewed and discussed. Critical opinion was divided; those sympathetic to its social and political message liked the book, but others thought it dangerously radical. The Northern Star reviewer called Dickens \\"the champion of the poor\\"; John Bull rejected his unflattering caricatures of philanthropy. It was certainly a financial success for Dickens, and remained popular for many years, although in the long term its fame was eclipsed by that of A Christmas Carol. ==Allusions and references== ===Allusions to other works=== Asking the upper classes to stop interfering with his life and leave him to die, Will Fern makes a bitter reference to the biblical Book of Ruth, deliberately misquoting Ruth's \\"Whither thou goest, I will go\\" speech. ===Allusions to actual history, geography and current science=== The novel's setting is contemporary and the 1840s (the \\"Hungry Forties\\") were a time of social and political unrest. Trotty's conviction that poor people are naturally wicked is influenced by an article in his newspaper about a young woman who has tried to drown herself and her child, and this motif returns at the climax of the book, when Meg is driven to contemplate the same course of action. This is a reference to Mary Furley, a destitute young woman sentenced to death in 1844 for infanticide after her desperation not to return to the workhouse led to a suicide attempt in which her child drowned. This case caused great public debate in the late spring of 1844. Dickens took part in the general outcry against the sentence, which was eventually commuted to transportation.Slater, 264 Among other works inspired by the Furley case is Thomas Hood's poem The Bridge of Sighs. Alderman Cute is a parody of Sir Peter Laurie, a Middlesex magistrate, alderman and former Lord Mayor of London, known for his determination to \\"put down\\" the lower classes and their antisocial behaviour. His remarks on the 1844 Mary Furley case have been cited as one inspiration to Dickens to write The Chimes. The unnamed young man who harks back to the \\"good old times\\" is a reference to the Young England movement. Dickens removed many of these references prior to publication. ==Adaptations== In 1914, the book was made into a silent film, The Chimes, directed by Thomas Bentley. A musical adaptation of The Chimes was created in 1992 by Lisa Kofod and Gay Donat Reed, with music by Paul Johnson. A staged reading of this work was produced at The Workhouse Theatre in New York City. The Chimes was adapted into a 24-minute clay-animated film in 2000 by Xyzoo Animation. It won a Cine Special Jury award in 2002. The Colonial Radio Theatre in Boston produced a full cast radio production of The Chimes in 2000. This was released on CD by Blackstone Audio in 2007, and re-released by Brilliance Audio in 2011. In 2004, a stage adaptation by Les Smith premiered at the Southwark Playhouse. In 2015, Audible issued The Chimes as a free audible book with Christmas well wishes from the company to its subscribers. ==References== ==External links== Online editions *The Chimes at Internet Archive. * Film *Official film website Theatre * \\"The- Chimes.com\\" Category:Novels by Charles Dickens Category:1844 British novels Category:British novels adapted into films Category:British novels adapted into plays Category:Christmas novels Category:English novels Category:New Year celebrations Category:Novels set in London Category:Fictional goblins Category:Novels adapted into radio programs Category:Chapman & Hall books Category:Victorian novels Category:New Year novels ","title":"The Chimes"},{"id":"1282411","text":"In computer engineering, an orthogonal instruction set is an instruction set architecture where all instruction types can use all addressing modes. It is \\"orthogonal\\" in the sense that the instruction type and the addressing mode vary independently. An orthogonal instruction set does not impose a limitation that requires a certain instruction to use a specific register so there is little overlapping of instruction functionality. Orthogonality was considered a major goal for processor designers in the 1970s, and the VAX-11 is often used as the benchmark for this concept. However, the introduction of RISC design philosophies in the 1980s significantly reversed the trend against more orthogonality. Modern CPUs often simulate orthogonality in a pre-processing step before performing the actual tasks in a RISC-like core. ==Basic concepts== At their core, all general purpose computers work in the same underlying fashion; data stored in a main memory is read by the central processing unit (CPU) into a fast temporary memory (e.g. CPU registers), acted on, and then written back to main memory. Memory consists of a collection of data values, encoded as numbers and referred to by their addresses, also a numerical value. This means the same operations applied to the data can be applied to the addresses themselves. While being worked on, data can be temporarily held in processor registers, scratchpad values that can be accessed very quickly. Registers are used, for example, when adding up strings of numbers into a total. ===Single instruction, single operand=== In early computers, the instruction set architecture (ISA) often used a single register, in which case it was known as the accumulator. Instructions included an address for the operand. For instance, an \`ADD address\` instruction would cause the CPU to retrieve the number in memory found at that address and then add it to the value already in the accumulator. This very simple example ISA has a \\"one-address format\\" because each instruction includes the address of the data. One-address machines have the disadvantage that even simple actions like an addition require multiple instructions, each of which takes up scarce memory, and requires time to be read. Consider the simple task of adding two numbers, 5 + 4. In this case, the program would have to load the value 5 into the accumulator with the \`LOAD address\` instruction, use the \`ADD address\` instruction pointing to the address for the 4, and finally \`SAVE address\` to store the result, 9, back to another memory location. ===Single instruction, multiple operands=== Further improvements can be found by providing the address of both of the operands in a single instruction, for instance, \`ADD address 1, address 2\`. Such \\"two-address format\\" ISAs are very common. One can further extend the concept to a \\"three-address format\\" where the \`SAVE\` is also folded into an expanded \`ADD address 1, address 2, address of result\`. It is often the case that the basic computer word is much larger than needed to hold just the instruction and an address, and in most systems, there are leftover bits that can be used to hold a constant instead of an address. Instructions can be further improved if they allow any one of the operands to be replaced by a constant. For instance, \`ADD address 1, constant 1\` eliminates one memory cycle, and \`ADD constant 1, constant 2\` another. ===Multiple data=== Further complexity arises when one considers common patterns in which memory is accessed. One very common pattern is that a single operation may be applied across a large amount of similar data. For instance, one might want to add up 1,000 numbers. In a simple two-address format of instructions, there is no way to change the address, so 1,000 additions have to be written in the machine language. ISAs fix this problem with the concept of indirect addressing, in which the address of the next point of data is not a constant, but itself held in memory. This means the programmer can change the address by performing addition on that memory location. ISAs also often include the ability to offset an address from an initial location, by adding a value held in one of its registers, in some cases a special index register. Others carry out this addition automatically as part of the instructions that use it. The variety of addressing modes leads to a profusion of slightly different instructions. Considering a one-address ISA, for even a single instruction, \`ADD\`, we now have many possible \\"addressing modes\\": * Immediate (constant): \`ADD.C constant 1\` — adds the constant value to the result in the accumulator * Direct address: \`ADD.A address 1\` — add the value stored at address 1 * Memory indirect: \`ADD.M address 1\` — read the value in address 1, use that value as another address and add that value Many ISAs also have registers that can be used for addressing as well as math tasks. This can be used in a one-address format if a single address register is used. In this case, a number of new modes become available: * Register direct: \`ADD.R register 1\` — add the value stored in the address held in register one * Displacement: \`ADD.D constant 1\` — add the constant to the address register, then add the value found in memory at that resulting location * Index: \`ADD.I register 1\` — add the value in register 1 to the address register to make a new address and then adds the value at that location to the accumulator * Autoindex: \`ADD.AI register 1\` — as in the Index case, but automatically increments the address ==Orthogonality== Orthogonality is the principle that every instruction should be able to use any supported addressing mode. In this example, if the direct addressing version of \`ADD\` is available, all the others should be as well. The reason for this design is not aesthetic, the goal is to reduce the total size of a program's object code. By providing a variety of addressing modes, the ISA allows the programmer to chose the one that precisely matches the need of their program at that point, and thereby reduce the need to use multiple instructions to achieve the same end. This means the total number of instructions is reduced, both saving memory and improving performance. Orthogonality was often described as being highly \\"bit efficient\\". As the ultimate end of orthogonal design is simply to allow any instruction to use any type of address, implementing orthogonality is often simply a case of adding more wiring between the parts of the processor. However, it also adds to the complexity of the instruction decoder, the circuitry that reads an instruction from memory at the location pointed to by the program counter and then decides how to process it. In the example ISA outlined above, the \`ADD.C\` instruction using direct encoding already has the data it needs to run the instruction and no further processing is needed, the decoder simply sends the value into the arithmetic logic unit (ALU). However, if the \`ADD.A\` instruction is used, the address has to be read, the value at that memory location read, and then the ALU can continue. This series of events will take much longer to complete and requires more internal steps. As a result, the time needed to complete different variations of an instruction can vary widely, which adds complexity to the overall CPU design. Therefore, orthogonality represents a tradeoff in design; the computer designer can choose to offer more addressing modes to the programmer to improve code density at the cost of making the CPU itself more complex. When memory was small and expensive, especially during the era of drum memory or core memory, orthogonality was highly desirable. However, the complexity was often beyond what could be achieved using current technology. For this reason, most machines from the 1960s offered only partial orthogonality, as much as the designers could afford. It was in the 1970s that the introduction of large scale integration significantly reduced the complexity of computer designs and fully orthogonal designs began to emerge. By the 1980s, such designs could be implemented on a single-chip CPU. In the late 1970s, with the first high- powered fully orthogonal designs emerging, the goal widened to become the high-level language computer architecture, or HLLCA for short. Just as orthogonality was desired to improve the bit density of machine language, HLLCA's goal was to improve the bit density of high-level languages like ALGOL 68. These languages generally used an activation record, a type of complex stack that stored temporary values, which the ISAs generally did not directly support and had to be implemented using many individual instructions from the underlying ISA. Adding support for these structures would allow the program to be translated more directly into the ISA. ==Orthogonality in practice== ===The PDP-11=== The PDP-11 was substantially orthogonal (primarily excepting its floating point instructions). Most integer instructions could operate on either 1-byte or 2-byte values and could access data stored in registers, stored as part of the instruction, stored in memory, or stored in memory and pointed to by addresses in registers. Even the PC and the stack pointer could be affected by the ordinary instructions using all of the ordinary data modes. \\"Immediate\\" mode (hardcoded numbers within an instruction, such as ADD #4, R1 (R1 = R1 + 4) was implemented as the mode \\"register indirect, autoincrement\\" and specifying the program counter (R7) as the register to use reference for indirection and to autoincrement. The PDP-11 used 3-bit fields for addressing modes (0-7) and registers (R0–R5, SP, PC), so there were (electronically) 8 addressing modes. Immediate and absolute address operands applying the two autoincrement modes to the Program Counter (R7), provided a total of 10 conceptual addressing modes. ===The VAX-11=== The VAX-11 extended the PDP-11's orthogonality to all data types, including floating point numbers. Instructions such as 'ADD' were divided into data-size dependent variants such as ADDB, ADDW, ADDL, ADDP, ADDF for add byte, word, longword, packed BCD and single-precision floating point, respectively. Like the PDP-11, the Stack Pointer and Program Counter were in the general register file (R14 and R15). The general form of a VAX-11 instruction would be: opcode [ operand ] [ operand ] ... Each component being one byte, the opcode a value in the range 0–255, and each operand consisting of two nibbles, the upper 4 bits specifying an addressing mode, and the lower 4 bits (usually) specifying a register number (R0–R15). In contrast to the PDP-11's 3-bit fields, the VAX-11's 4-bit sub-bytes resulted in 16 logical addressing modes (0–15). However, addressing modes 0–3 were \\"short immediate\\" for immediate data of 6 bits or less (the 2 low-order bits of the addressing mode being the 2 high-order bits of the immediate data, when prepended to the remaining 4 bits in that data-addressing byte). Since addressing modes 0-3 were identical, this made 13 (electronic) addressing modes, but as in the PDP-11, the use of the Stack Pointer (R14) and Program Counter (R15) created a total of over 15 conceptual addressing modes (with the assembler program translating the source code into the actual stack- pointer or program-counter based addressing mode needed). ===The MC68000 and similar=== Motorola's designers attempted to make the assembly language orthogonal while the underlying machine language was somewhat less so. Unlike PDP-11, the MC68000 (68k) used separate registers to store data and the addresses of data in memory. The ISA was orthogonal to the extent that addresses could only be used in those registers, but there was no restriction on which of the registers could be used by different instructions. Likewise, the data registers were also orthogonal across instructions. In contrast, the NS320xx series were originally designed as single-chip implementations of the VAX-11 ISA. Although this had to change due to legal issues, the resulting system retained much of the VAX-11's overall design philosophy and remained completely orthogonal. This included the elimination of the separate data and address registers found in the 68k. ===The 8080 and follow on designs=== The 8-bit Intel 8080 (as well as the 8085 and 8051) microprocessor was basically a slightly extended accumulator-based design and therefore not orthogonal. An assembly-language programmer or compiler writer had to be mindful of which operations were possible on each register: Most 8-bit operations could be performed only on the 8-bit accumulator (the A-register), while 16-bit operations could be performed only on the 16-bit pointer/accumulator (the HL- register pair), whereas simple operations, such as increment, were possible on all seven 8-bit registers. This was largely due to a desire to keep all opcodes one byte long. The binary-compatible Z80 later added prefix-codes to escape from this 1-byte limit and allow for a more powerful instruction set. The same basic idea was employed for the Intel 8086, although, to allow for more radical extensions, binary-compatibility with the 8080 was not attempted here. It maintained some degree of non-orthogonality for the sake of high code density at the time. The 32-bit extension of this architecture that was introduced with the 80386, was somewhat more orthogonal despite keeping all the 8086 instructions and their extended counterparts. However, the encoding- strategy used still shows many traces from the 8008 and 8080 (and Z80). For instance, single-byte encodings remain for certain frequent operations such as push and pop of registers and constants; and the primary accumulator, the EAX register, employs shorter encodings than the other registers on certain types of operations. Observations like this are sometimes exploited for code optimization in both compilers and hand written code. ==RISC== A number of studies through the 1970s demonstrated that the flexibility offered by orthogonal modes was rarely or never used in actual problems. In particular, an effort at IBM studied traces of code running on the System/370 and demonstrated that only a fraction of the available modes were being used in actual programs. Similar studies, often about the VAX, demonstrated the same pattern. In some cases, it was shown that the complexity of the instructions meant they took longer to perform than the sequence of smaller instructions, with the canonical example of this being the VAX's \`INDEX\` instruction. During this same period, semiconductor memories were rapidly increasing in size and decreasing in cost. However, they were not improving in speed at the same rate. This meant the time needed to access data from memory was growing in relative terms in comparison to the speed of the CPUs. This argued for the inclusion of more registers, giving the CPU more temporary values to work with. A larger number of registers meant more bits in the computer word would be needed to encode the register number, which suggested that the instructions themselves be reduced in number to free up room. Finally, a paper by Andrew Tanenbaum demonstrated that 97% of all the constants in a program are between 0 and 10, with 0 representing between 20 and 30% of the total. Additionally, between 30 and 40% of all the values in a program are constants, with simple variables (as opposed to arrays or such) another 35 to 40%. If the processor uses a larger instruction word, like 32-bits, two constants and a register number can be encoded in a single instruction as long as the instruction itself does not use too many bits. These observations led to the abandonment of the orthogonal design as a primary goal of processor design, and the rise of the RISC philosophy in the 1980s. RISC processors generally have only two addressing modes, direct (constant) and register. All of the other modes found in older processors are handled explicitly using load and store instructions moving data to and from the registers. Only a few addressing modes may be available, and these modes may vary depending on whether the instruction refers to data or involves a transfer of control. ==Notes== ==References== Category:Instruction processing * ","title":"Orthogonal instruction set"},{"id":"1282425","text":"The Cricket on the Hearth: A Fairy Tale of Home is a novella by Charles Dickens, published by Bradbury and Evans, and released 20 December 1845 with illustrations by Daniel Maclise, John Leech, Richard Doyle, Clarkson Stanfield and Edwin Henry Landseer. Dickens began writing the book around 17 October 1845 and finished it by 1 December. Like all of Dickens's Christmas books, it was published in book form, not as a serial. Dickens described the novel as \\"quiet and domestic [...] innocent and pretty.\\" It is subdivided into chapters called \\"Chirps\\", similar to the \\"Quarters\\" of The Chimes or the \\"Staves\\" of A Christmas Carol. It is the third of Dickens's five Christmas books, preceded by A Christmas Carol (1843) and The Chimes (1844), and followed by The Battle of Life (1846) and The Haunted Man and the Ghost's Bargain (1848). ==Background== In July 1845, Dickens contemplated forming a periodical focusing on the concerns of the home. It was to be called The Cricket, but the plan fell through, and he transformed his idea into a Christmas book in which he abandoned social criticism, current events, and topical themes in favour of simple fantasy and a domestic setting for his hero's redemption, though some have criticised this notion. The book was released on 20 December 1845 (the title page read \\"1846\\") and sold briskly into the New Year. Seventeen stage productions opened during the Christmas season 1845 with one production receiving Dickens's approval and opening on the same day as the book's release. Dickens read the tale four times in public performance. It has been dramatised in numerous languages and for years was more popular on stage than A Christmas Carol. Cricket is less explicitly Christian than some of Dickens's other Christmas books, and it has been criticised for its sentimentality, but contemporary readers were attracted to its depiction of the Victorian ideal of the happy home. ==Plot== John Peerybingle, a carrier, lives with his young wife Dot, their baby boy and their nanny Tilly Slowboy. A cricket chirps on the hearth and acts as a guardian angel to the family. One day a mysterious elderly stranger comes to visit and takes up lodging at Peerybingle's house for a few days. The life of the Peerybingles intersects with that of Caleb Plummer, a poor toymaker employed by the miser Mr. Tackleton. Caleb has a blind daughter Bertha, and a son Edward, who travelled to South America and is thought to be dead. The miser Tackleton is now on the eve of marrying Edward's sweetheart, May, but she does not love Tackleton. Tackleton tells John Peerybingle that his wife Dot has cheated on him, and shows him a clandestine scene in which Dot embraces the mysterious lodger; the latter, who is in disguise, is actually a much younger man than he seems. John is cut to the heart over this as he loves his wife dearly, but decides after some deliberations to relieve his wife of their marriage contract. In the end, the mysterious lodger is revealed to be none other than Edward who has returned home in disguise. Dot shows that she has indeed been faithful to John. Edward marries May hours before she is scheduled to marry Tackleton. However, Tackleton's heart is melted by the festive cheer (in a manner reminiscent of Ebenezer Scrooge), and he surrenders May to her true love . ==Characters== * John Peerybingle, a carrier; a lumbering, slow, honest man * Mrs. Mary Peerybingle, (\\"Dot\\"), John Peerybingle's wife * Caleb Plummer, a poor old toymaker in the employ of Tackleton * Bertha Plummer, the blind daughter of Caleb Plummer * Edward Plummer, the son of Caleb Plummer * Tackleton (called \\"Gruff and Tackleton\\"), a stern, ill-natured, sarcastic toy merchant * May Fielding, a friend to Mrs. Peerybingle * Mrs. Fielding, her mother; a little, peevish, querulous old lady * Tilly Slowboy, a great clumsy girl; Mrs. Peerybingle's nursemaid * the baby, child of Dot and John, treated as an object throughout the story. ==Literary significance and criticism== The book was a huge commercial success, quickly going through two editions. Reviews were favourable, but not all so. In an unsigned piece in The Times the reviewer opined, \\"We owe it to literature to protest against this last production of Mr. Dickens [...] Shades of Fielding and Scott! Is it for such jargon as this that we have given your throne to one who cannot estimate his eminence?\\"The Times, 27 December 1845. Reproduced in Philip Collins, Charles Dickens: The Critical Heritage, Psychology Press, 5 Mar 1996. pg. 159 However, William Makepeace Thackeray enjoyed the book immensely: \\"To us, it appears it is a good Christmas book, illuminated with extra gas, crammed with extra bonbons, French plums and sweetness [...] This story is no more a real story than Peerybingle is a real name!\\"Royal Society of Literature (Great Britain), Essays by divers hands: being the transactions of the Royal Society of Literature of the United Kingdom, Volume 32, H. Mulford, Oxford University Press, 1963. pg. 103 Dickens's portrayal of the blind girl Bertha is significant. Victorians believed disabilities were inherited, and thus it was not socially acceptable for the blind to marry (although they often did in reality).Holmes, Martha Stoddard. Dickens, Charles: The Cricket on the Hearth. Web page sourced from Christmas Books (The New Oxford Illustrated Dickens) (1954) In fictional courtship plots, the blind were often used to build tension since it was assumed they must be kept from marrying. The fictional portrayal of Bertha is similar to Dickens's description in American Notes (1842) of the deaf and blind girl Laura Bridgman, whom he saw on a visit to the Perkins Institution for the Blind in Boston, Massachusetts. Modern scholars have given the story little attention, but Andrew Sangers has argued it contains similarities to Shakespeare's comedies and should be seen \\"both as a significant indication of the tastes of the 1840s and of Dickens himself.\\" Vladimir Lenin left during a performance of the Cricket play in Russia, as he found it dull and the saccharine sentimentality got on his nerves. This incident might now be little remembered if George Orwell had not mentioned it in his essay on Dickens. ==Adaptations== Stage adaptations include the successful The Cricket on the Hearth by Albert Richard Smith produced at the Surrey Theatre in 1845, and Dion Boucicault's Dot, A Drama in Three Acts (or simply Dot), first performed at New York's Winter Garden in 1859. It was staged repeatedly in Britain and America for the remainder of the 19th century, starring, at times, John Toole, Henry Irving, and Jean Davenport. The play helped launch the career of American actor Joseph Jefferson (1829–1905). The novella was the basis for at least two operas: Karl Goldmark's Das Heimchem am Herd with a libretto by A. M. Willner (premiere: June 1896, Berlin; New York 1910), and Riccardo Zandonai's Il grillo del focolare with a libretto by Cesare Hanau (premiere: November 1908, Turin). Goldmark's opera was performed in Philadelphia in November 1912 with the Cricket sung by American soprano Mabel Riegelman (1889, Cincinnati – 1967, Burlingame, California). Film, radio, and television adaptations include three American silent film versions: one, directed by D.W. Griffith (1909) starring Owen Moore, another directed by L. Marston (1914) starring Alan Hale, and one directed by Lorimer Johnston (1923). A silent Russian version, Sverchok na Pechi (1915) was directed by Boris Sushkevich and Aleksandr Uralsky and starred Maria Ouspenskaya. A silent French version, Le Grillon du Foyer (1922), was directed and adapted by Jean Manoussi and starred Charles Boyer as Edouard. A 25-minute NBC radio play adaptation aired on 24 December 1945. In 1967, Rankin/Bass Productions produced a 50-minute animated television adaptation of the story, featuring the voices of Roddy MacDowall as the Cricket, and father and daughter Danny Thomas and Marlo Thomas as Caleb and Bertha, with various other characters voiced by Paul Frees and Hans Conried. This adaptation cuts several characters, including the central pair of John and Dot, focusing solely on Caleb and Bertha. Television Corporation of Japan (now Eiken) provided the animation for the special, while its seven original songs were written and composed by Maury Laws and Jules Bass. Rankin/Bass later produced their adaptations of Dickens' other holiday stories for television: A Christmas Tree (1850) as the ninth episode of their 1972–73 syndicated television series, Festival of Family Classics, and A Christmas Carol (1843) as the 1978 animated remake of the 1956 live action musical special, The Stingiest Man in Town. ==Notes== ==External links== Online editions *The Cricket on the Hearth at Internet Archive. *The Cricket on the Hearth at Dickens Literature * The Cricket on the Hearth at The University of Adelaide Library * Adaptations *Dot, A Drama in Three Acts by Dion Boucicault (1859) *Picture Gallery from Victorian Web Category:1845 British novels Category:British novels adapted into films Category:Novels adapted into operas Category:Novels by Charles Dickens Category:Christmas novels Category:Novels set in London Category:Christmas characters Category:British novellas Category:Fictional crickets Category:Fiction about insects Category:Victorian novels Category:1967 television specials Category:Novels adapted into television shows ","title":"The Cricket on the Hearth"},{"id":"1282428","text":"Briesen may refer to the following places: ==In Brandenburg, Germany== *Briesen (Spreewald), in the Spree-Neiße district *Briesen (Mark), in the Oder-Spree district *A part of Friesack, in the Havelland district *A part of Halbe, in the Dahme-Spreewald district ==German alternates== *An older name of Brezno, Slovakia *An older name of Brzeźno, Człuchów in Poland *An older name of Wąbrzeźno, Poland *An older name of Brzeżno, Poland ==Old district== *An old district in West Prussia ","title":"Briesen"},{"id":"1282434","text":"Dragon Fli Empire (abbreviated DFE) is a Canadian hip hop duo formed in 2002 from Calgary, comprising Tarik Robinson, also known as Teekay (MC/producer), and Adam Hicks, also known as DJ Cosm (DJ/producer). DFE's first album, Conquest, was released in August 2004. It was followed by Invasion in 2005, Intermission EP in 2008 and Redefine in 2009. Their music is inspired by classic hip hop beats like those of Pete Rock, Large Professor and Prince Paul. ==History== Dragon Fli Empire formed in May 2002. They released the original version of their debut album Conquest locally in the summer of 2002 as a limited edition CD-R. The song \\"Mount Pleasant\\", a track about observations while riding Calgary Transit received airplay on CJSW-FM, CKUA and CBC Radio 3. An official version of Conquest was pressed and independently released in August 2004. The album was re-mastered and three tracks from the CD-R version were replaced with newer ones, including the DFE theme song \\"D-E-F\\". Their second album, Invasion, was independently released in May 2005. Reaching number five on the !earshot Canadian campus radio charts, it showcased a progression in the group's sound, and featured the tracks \\"Headphones\\", \\"Our Way\\", \\"Invasion\\" and \\"Tight Spot\\". The group collaborated with several other Canadian indie hip hop artists on the album, including Ndidi Cascade, More or Les, Epic, Mindbender and Touch and Nato plus live musicians like Kirby Small and Tariq. In 2007, an album featuring tracks from Invasion and Conquest (Inquest) was released in Japan through P-Vine Records. The same year, a 12\\" vinyl release of the Invasion song \\"Roc the Crowd\\" featuring Ohmega Watts was released worldwide on Calgary-based label Bigfoot Records. DFE released an EP entitled Intermission in May 2008 prior to their third full-length album Redefine. The EP reached number three on the !earshot and Chart Attack hip hop charts. Intermission also reached number three on The R3-30 on CBC Radio 3. Two tracks from Intermission were nominated for Radio 3's 2008 Bucky Awards. The group's third full-length album, Redefine released in Japan on P-Vine Records in October 2008 and in North America on Makebelieve Records in January 2009. Redefine featured collaborations with a number of high-profile artists including Cadence Weapon, Masta Ace, Ohmega Watts, Josh Martinez, Moka Only and Raashan Ahmad. It reached number one for two weeks on the !earshot and Chart Attack hip hop charts, and was number three for several weeks on the CMJ hip hop charts. The video for \\"Outside Inn\\" was the group's first to receive rotation on MuchMusic and MuchVibe. Redefine was also nominated for Best Rap / Hip Hop Recording at the 2009 Western Canadian Music Awards. The Ride On EP vinyl was released via Finnish label Traveller Records in September 2009, featuring four songs from Redefine. Dragon Fli Empire was the first hip hop group featured on the annual MUCH does Calgary talent showcase on MuchMusic in 2005. They have also appeared on CBC-TV's ZeD and The National. The group has toured across Canada, Europe and parts of the U.S., and played festivals like Shambhala, Montreal's Under Pressure, Ottawa's Alberta Scene and Yellowknife's Folk on the Rocks. DFE has also played select dates of Warped Tour and Rock the Bells as well as showcasing locally at JunoFest, Sled Island, the Calgary International Spoken Word Festival and the Calgary Folk Music Festival.

Turner, circa 1835 Handline fishing, or handlining, is a fishing technique where a single fishing line is held in the hands. It is not to be confused with handfishing. One or more fishing lures or baited hooks are attached to the line. A hook, fishing lure, or a fishing jig and many times a weight and/or a fishing float can be attached to the line. Handlining is among the oldest forms of fishing and is commonly practiced throughout the world today. Handlining for codfish in Alaska, 1912 The fishing bait can be still fished, trolled or jigged up and down in a series of short movements. Often handling is done close to the bottom of the body of water but can also be done near or on the surface. ==Salt water handlining== Ocean handlining is often used to catch groundfish and squid but other species are sometimes caught, including pelagic fish. Sea handlining is a good way to catch larger oceanic fish. ==Freshwater handlining== Handlining is also used for catching fresh water fish. Panfish, walleyes, and other freshwater game fish can be caught using handlining fishing techniques. Handlining can be practiced from the shore or from a fishing boat. Walleye anglers practice handlining over moderately deep water in a drifting boat. Handlining is also practiced by ice fishing anglers. ==Techniques== A jigging motion can be used to attract fish which are normally caught while trying to strike the lure but they can also be snagged by the hooks as they investigate the jigged lure. The lure can also be fished motionless and the angler feels for the bait to be picked up by a fish and then sets the hook after waiting for the fish to fully take the bait. After a strike occurs the hook is set and then the fish is hauled in and the caught fish is removed. ==See also== * Fishing techniques * Jigging * Trolling (fishing) ==References== * Bjarnason, B A (1992) Handlining and squid jigging.

He proposed that \\"a change in the relative prices of the factors of production is itself a spur to invention, and to invention of a particular kind--directed to economizing the use of a factor which has become relatively expensive.\\" Considerable literature has been produced on this hypothesis, which is often presented in terms of the effects of wage increases as an encouragement to labor-saving innovation. The hypothesis has also been applied to viewing increases in energy costs as a motivation for a more rapid improvement in energy efficiency of goods than would normally occur. == Induced innovation in climate change == A significant application of Hicks's theory can be found in the field of climate change. The exponential population growth occurred in the last century has drastically increased pressure on natural resources. In order to have a sustainable future it is imperative to modify global strategies on climate change and the induced innovation theory can aid to model these policies. To calculate the human impact on the environment economists often use the I=P*A*T equation where “I”, the impact variable, (for example energy consumption) is the product of “P”, the population, “A” the affluence (often embodied by GDP per capita) and “T” the technology. The technical coefficient represents the efficiency of the system in use for particular resource and expresses the average state of technology. The decrease of \\"T\\" would indicate a gain in efficiency however “I” could still be growing or remaining stable if the improved technology is not sufficient to compensate the effect of an increase in \\"P\\" and \\"A\\". Therefore, a reduction in “I” would always mean that pressure on resources has lightened but this might not always be the consequence of using resources more efficiently (reducing T). A fundamental issue of climate change is the excess of greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere particularly as the result of an intensified economic activity. Global GDP and emissions were growing at a corresponding rate in the until the 1970s. It was then that oil prices have increased exponentially causing people to reduce its consumption. According to Hicks's theory a change in factor prices will stimulate development of technical innovation to reduce the use of the factor for which the price increased compared to other factors. Following the oil shock significant investments were made in alternative sources of energy, more efficient cars and heating systems to mitigate oil consumption. As a result, emissions started growing at a slower rate than GDP per capita. Although petrol prices then dropped in the 1980s, emissions have continued to grow more slowly than GDP. This is an indication of a complete structural change in technology induced by the need to innovate. == Induced innovation in agriculture == The development of agriculture is a fundamental part of the world economic growth. Being able to meet the demand of an exponentially growing population can be a challenging task, especially if we consider that one of the most important factors, land, remains fairly fixed. According to the World Bank data, less than 38% of the global surface area can be deemed usable for cultivation of crops or permanent pastures. Expanding such a number can only be achieved by remediation of soil in a certain area in order to make the land fertile. Such an intervention requires a huge investment that can be amortized only in a long period of time. Therefore, to meet the increasing demand, countries are forced to drastically increase the productivity of the land they dispose. This is where induced innovation steps in. In order to best explain how Hicks’s theory works, consider a situation in which the demand for agricultural derived products increases as a result of either population growth or increased household income. Theory states that in such a situation, prices of inputs for which supply is inelastic will rise relative to prices of more elastic inputs. Similarly, if the supply of a particular input increases at a faster rate than the supply of other inputs, the price of such input will decline relative to the price of the other factors of production used. Ideally then, farmers would be looking to replace or use less of the more inelastic and less responsive factors of production since they are the more expensive to use. Therefore, technical innovations that replace such inputs would guarantee less costs and hence more profits. In other words, when demand for their products increases, farmers are lured by changes in relative prices to seek for technological alternatives that substitute the increasingly scarce factors of production. Here is where government intervention would be beneficial. Agricultural workers cannot develop these innovations themselves and therefore demand that public research institutions develop new technologies that will then be transformed into modernized machinery that agricultural supply firms can sell to local farmers. Scientists will now study the best solution to this problem and respond by making the appropriate technical development such that producers can efficiently substitute the abundant inputs for the increasingly scarce factors. Ultimately this will lead to a reduction of farmer’s unit costs in the best way. ==See also== *Creativity techniques *Frugal innovation *International Innovation Index ==References== *The Theory of Wages, J.

He graduated from Tufts University in 1883 with an A.M.B. and received an A.M.M. degree one year later. Previously, for one year (1879–80), he was instructor in chemistry in the Massachusetts Institute of Technology; later (1883–86), he was instructor in mathematics and applied mechanics at Tufts College. From college, he went on to develop the electric transportation system in Boston and, with electric powered streetcars of major importance, in 1894 he was appointed the head engineer for Metropolitan Street Railways in New York City. Pearson built a reputation as an innovative electrical engineer in the United States and he was soon contracted by governments and businesses as a consulting engineer for power generating stations throughout North America. A man with great business skills and a foresight, with ready financial backers he undertook major projects in North and South America. He was the Founder of Barcelona Traction and Brookfield Asset Management. While in Canada, he developed a relationship with a bright and aggressive young lawyer/stockbroker in Montreal, Quebec by the name of James Dunn. Pearson encouraged Dunn to take up residency in London, at the time the most important financial market in the world. With Dunn's brokerage house underwriting his ventures share offerings, sufficient capital was raised to allow Pearson to create a massive business empire that included the São Paulo Tramway, Light and Power Company in Brazil, the Mexican North Western Railway, the Mexican Tramway Company, and the Mexican Light and Power Company in Mexico, and the British American Nickel Company in Canada. Unstable governments in Mexico along with rampant bribery and corruption of public officials caused Pearson considerable grief. The government of president Venustiano Carranza nationalized his Mexican Tramway Company and in the end, he lost virtually everything he had invested in Mexico. During this time, he was behind the 1911 construction of the Medina Dam on the Medina River in what is now Mico, Texas and built an irrigation district encompassing more than 34,000 acres (138 km²). The town of Pearson, Texas was named in his honor. In 1912, he organized a syndicate in Hale County, Texas near Plainview for drilling irrigation wells to irrigate about 60,000 acres (243 km²). During the course of his work in Texas, Pearson founded the town of Natalia, naming it after his daughter, Natalie Pearson Nicholson. In 1913, he negotiated a deal with the Spanish government for a hydro project on the Ebro River and formed the Barcelona Traction, Light and Power Company to carry out the construction that was completed in 1915. However, World War I limited his activity. He and his wife, Mabel Ward Pearson, lost their lives on May 7, 1915, while travelling to England on business and to visit his daughter Natalie who was then living there. They were on the ocean liner when it was torpedoed off the southern coast of Ireland by German U-boat . Pearson Hall, home of the Chemistry Department at Tufts University, is named for him. ==References== ==External links== *Biography at the Dictionary of Canadian Biography Online *Biography at The Lusitania Resource * *An Extreme Power Engineer: The Accomplishments Of Fred Stark Pearson, Part One, IEEE.org Category:1861 births Category:1915 deaths Category:Engineers from Massachusetts Category:American financiers Category:Deaths on the RMS Lusitania Category:Deaths due to shipwreck Category:People from Lowell, Massachusetts Category:Tufts University School of Engineering alumni ","title":"Frederick Stark Pearson"},{"id":"1282481","text":"Buchholz may refer to: ==Places== ===Germany=== *Buchholz in der Nordheide, a town in the district of Harburg, Lower Saxony *Französisch Buchholz, a part of Pankow in Berlin *Märkisch Buchholz, in the Dahme-Spreewald district, Brandenburg *Buchholz, Schaumburg, in the district of Schaumburg, Lower Saxony *Buchholz, Soltau-Fallingbostel, in the district Soltau-Fallingbostel, Lower Saxony *Buchholz, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, in the Müritz district, Mecklenburg- Vorpommern *Gremersdorf-Buchholz in the Nordvorpommern district, Mecklenburg- Vorpommern *Buchholz, Neuwied, in the district of Neuwied, Rhineland- Palatinate *Annaberg-Buchholz, a town in Saxony *Buchholz, Saxony-Anhalt, a town in the district of Stendal, Saxony-Anhalt *Buchholz, Dithmarschen in the district of Dithmarschen, Schleswig-Holstein *Buchholz, Lauenburg in the district of Lauenburg, Schleswig-Holstein *Buchholz, Thuringia, in the district of Nordhausen, Thuringia *Galerie Buchholz, a chain of art galleries in Cologne and Berlin *Wittenberge-Buchholz railway, a railway ===Austria=== *Buchholz, a part of Treffen in Carinthia ===Belgium=== *Buchholz, a village of Büllingen in Verviers, Liège ===United States=== *Buchholz High School, a high school in Gainesville, Florida ===Marshall Islands=== *Bucholz Army Airfield, an army airfield in the Marshall Islands. ===Poland=== * Buchholz (East Prussia), German name of Bukowiec, Bartoszyce County * Buchholz (New March), German name of Grabno, Lubusz Voivodeship * Buchholz, (Pomerania), German name of Grabowo, Stargard County ==Other== * Buchholz (surname) *Buchholz relay, a safety device for oil-filled electrical transformers *Buchholz system, a chess ranking system ","title":"Buchholz"},{"id":"1282496","text":"Baumkuchen is a German variety of spit cake.

The State of Bavaria claims that baumkuchen has been created since at least the 19th century in Bavaria. Another line of thought suggests that this cake had its beginnings as a Hungarian wedding cake, that is, a derivative of the oldest Hungarian pastry kürtőskalács (chimney cake). A recipe for baumkuchen appears in Ein new Kochbuch (literally \\"A New Cookbook\\"), published in 1581, the first cookbook written for professional chefs by Marx Rumpolt.Alan Davidson and Tom Jaine (2006). The Oxford companion to food. Oxford University Press, USA, 2006. p. 805 . Marx Rumpolt had previously worked as a chef in Hungary and Bohemia. In 1682, a rural medic working for Johann Sigismund Elsholtz prepared a similar dessert. Aside from the above mentioned recent history, baumkuchen was already known in Ancient Greece and the latter Rome. The Roman conquerors brought the method for baking cakes on logs over an open fire to what is today Germany and its surroundings. ==Characteristics== Baking demonstration in Germany, here: application of the couverture chocolate.

Baumkuchen ingredients are typically butter, eggs, sugar, vanilla, salt, and flour. Baking powder is not considered a traditional ingredient. The ratio of flour, butter and eggs is typically 1:1:2 respectively (i.e., 100 grams of flour, 100 grams of butter, and 200 grams of eggs). The recipe can be varied by adding other ingredients, such as ground nuts, honey, marzipan, nougat and rum or brandy, to the batter or filling. Additionally, baumkuchen may be covered with sugar or chocolate glaze. With some recipes, the fully baked and cooled baumkuchen is first coated with marmalade or jam, and then covered with chocolate. ===Baumkuchenspitzen=== Baumkuchenspitzen, German for \\"tree cake tips\\", are miniature versions of baumkuchen that are created from the cake when it is cut in slices and then into pieces that are referred to as \\"Spitzen\\". These pieces are typically coated in chocolate and sold individually. ===Schichttorte=== A simpler horizontally layered version of the cake is called a \\"Schichttorte\\". It is baked without a spit, which results in horizontal layers instead of circular rings. The Schichttorte is more like a conventional cake in shape and can be baked in a conventional home oven that has a broiler inside, whereas the traditional spit version requires special equipment normally not available in an average home. Compared to the spit variant, the Schichttorte's cross section is less reminiscent of tree rings. ==In Japan== Baumkuchen is one of the most popular pastries in Japan, where it is called . It is a popular return present in Japan for wedding guests because of its typical ring shape. It was first introduced to Japan by the German Karl Joseph Wilhelm Juchheim.

In \\"Inner City Blues\\", Mayer called upon DJ Logic, the support act of the Heavier Things tour, to join him to perform a turntable solo. ==Performing band== The songs all feature Mayer's touring band of the time: * John Mayer – guitar and vocals * David LaBruyere – bass guitar * David Ryan Harris – guitar and backing vocals * JJ Johnson – drums and percussion * Michael Chaves – guitar & vocals * Eric Jacobson – trumpet and dented flugelhorn * Chris Karlic – saxophone and flute * Kevin Lovejoy – keyboards ==Cover art for the series== The Great Wave off Kanagawa is the basis of the CD cover. Volume one features a cut-out silhouette version of Mayer (from the cover of Heavier Things) with two tones of blue. As it is separate from the other volumes, its artwork is rather distinct from the rest. Artwork for the covers of volumes two, three, four, and five is by the artist Kozyndan. They feature bunnies in out-of-character situations on their covers, including hanging from helium balloons (two) and in washing machines (three). The bunnies on the cover of four begin as amoeba and diagonally evolve into bunnies. The cover of volume five has several bunnies with their midsections replaced with springs. The CD release continued the use of bunnies, using the artwork 'Uprisings' by Kozyndan, which has hundreds of bunnies in formation to appear like revered Japanese artwork The Great Wave off Kanagawa. The artwork was originally created as a cover for issue 28 of the magazine Giant Robot.Kozyndan - Uprisings Notably, the CD is considered volume six (the last) of the series, and The Great Wave woodblock printing is the first of a 36-part series of art. ==Track listings== ===As/Is iTunes EP=== { align=none cellspacing=0 height=20 width=260 - align=\\"center\\" valign=\\"middle\\" style=\\"font-size: 8pt;\\" bgcolor=\\"#bb99bb\\" align=\\"center\\" colspan=2 Volume one - align=\\"center\\" valign=\\"middle\\" style=\\"font-size: 9pt;\\" bgcolor=\\"#ddbbdd\\" width=\\"50%\\" width=\\"50%\\"Released: December 1, 2003 - valign=\\"middle\\" style=\\"font-size: 9pt;\\" bgcolor=\\"#ddbbdd\\" bgcolor=\\"#ddbbdd\\" align=\\"left\\" colspan=2 # \\"Come Back to Bed\\" # \\"Your Body Is a Wonderland\\" # \\"Neon\\" # \\"St. Patrick's Day\\" # \\"83\\" # \\"Bigger Than My Body\\" } ===As/Is iTunes concert releases=== { align=none cellspacing=0 height=20 - align=\\"center\\" valign=\\"middle\\" style=\\"font-size: 8pt;\\" bgcolor=\\"#ddbbbb\\" width=\\"22%\\" align=\\"center\\" colspan=2 Volume two bgcolor=\\"#ddddbb\\" width=\\"22%\\" align=\\"center\\" colspan=2 Volume three bgcolor=\\"#bbddbb\\" width=\\"22%\\" align=\\"center\\" colspan=2 Volume four bgcolor=\\"#99bbdd\\" width=\\"22%\\" align=\\"center\\" colspan=2 Volume five - style=\\"font-size: 11pt;\\" align=\\"center\\" valign=\\"middle\\" bgcolor=\\"#ffdddd\\" width=\\"22%\\" align=\\"center\\" colspan=2 Mountain View California bgcolor=\\"#ffffdd\\" width=\\"22%\\" align=\\"center\\" colspan=2 The Woodlands Texas bgcolor=\\"#ddffdd\\" width=\\"11%\\" align=\\"center\\" Cleveland Ohio bgcolor=\\"#ddffdd\\" width=\\"11%\\" align=\\"center\\" Cincinnati Ohio bgcolor=\\"#bbddff\\" width=\\"11%\\" align=\\"center\\" Philadelphia Pennsylvania bgcolor=\\"#bbddff\\" width=\\"11%\\" align=\\"center\\" Hartford Connecticut - align=\\"center\\" valign=\\"middle\\" style=\\"font-size: 7pt;\\" bgcolor=\\"#ddbbbb\\" width=\\"22%\\" align=\\"center\\" colspan=2 Shoreline Amphitheatre bgcolor=\\"#ddddbb\\" width=\\"22%\\" align=\\"center\\" colspan=2 C.W.

The bridge has a total length of with a main span of . Designed by German engineer Hellmut Homberg and built by Cleveland Bridge, it is similar to a bridge across the Rhine in Düsseldorf. The Beauly Firth is a navigable waterway and hence the bridge is raised high over sea level. The four bridge towers dominate the Inverness skyline, especially at night when they are lit. The bridge carries the A9 trunk road north from Inverness to the Black Isle. It is the southernmost of the \\"Three Firths\\" crossings (Beauly, Cromarty and Dornoch) which has transformed road transport in the Highlands. It has proved a key factor in the growth of the city of Inverness. To protect against any potential seismic activity of the Great Glen Fault, the bridge includes seismic buffers in its construction. These buffers are at the north abutment, nearly over the line of the fault, and they supplement longitudinal restraint at Pier 7, the south main pier. Each buffer is just over long and weighs about . On the south side of the bridge is the Caledonian Stadium, home of Inverness Caledonian Thistle ==History== Prior to 1982, travellers north of Inverness had the choice of the Kessock Ferry or a journey via Beauly. Cleveland Bridge were awarded the £17.5million contract in 1975 (). Construction on the bridge began in 1976, with completion and opening in 1982. It won the combined design and construction Saltire Award. Transport Scotland estimated in 2012 that 30,000 vehicles per day were using the bridge. Since 2007, the 25th anniversary of it opening, the Kessock Bridge has featured on the obverse of the £100 note issued by the Bank of Scotland. The series of notes commemorates Scottish engineering achievements with illustrations of bridges in Scotland such as the Glenfinnan Viaduct and the Forth Bridge. The bridge was resurfaced from February to June 2013. The 20-week programme on the bridge's southbound carriageway will see Stirling Lloyd fulfil all preparation, waterproofing and resurfacing work using the Eliminator bridge deck waterproofing systemEliminator-bridge-deck-waterproofing-membrane combined with Gussasphalt, supplied by Stirling Lloyd's partners Aeschlimann AG. The project was managed by Stirling Lloyd's Darren Holmes, the improvement programme, being carried out on behalf of Transport Scotland, will, once completed, give the bridge deck surfacing a predicted life expectancy of over 30 years. In 2019, the bridge was awarded a Category B listed status by Historic Environment Scotland. ==See also== * Banknotes of Scotland (featured on design) ==References== ==External links== * Bridges of Inverness: Kessock Bridge * Eliminator-Datasheet Category:Bridges completed in 1982 Category:Bridges in Highland (council area) Category:Cable-stayed bridges in Scotland Category:Road bridges in Scotland Category:Transport in Highland (council area) Category:1982 establishments in Scotland Category:Black Isle Category:Buildings and structures in Inverness Category:Category B listed buildings in Highland (council area) ","title":"Kessock Bridge"},{"id":"1282525","text":"Francisella is a genus of pathogenic, Gram-negative bacteria. They are small coccobacillary or rod-shaped, nonmotile organisms, which are also facultative intracellular parasites of macrophages. Strict aerobes, Francisella colonies bear a morphological resemblance to those of the genus Brucella. The genus was named in honor of American bacteriologist Edward Francis, who, in 1922, first recognized F. tularensis (then named Bacterium tularensis) as the causative agent of tularemia. == Pathogenesis == The type species, F. tularensis, causes the disease tularemia or rabbit fever. F. novicida and F. philomiragia (previously Yersinia philomiragia) are associated with sepsis and invasive systemic infections. == Taxonomy == The taxonomy of the genus is somewhat uncertain, especially in the case of F. novicida (may be a subspecies of F. tularensis). In general, identification of species is accomplished by biochemical profiling or 16S rRNA sequencing. An updated phylogeny based on whole genome sequencing has recently been published showing the genus Francisella could be divided into two main genetic clades: one including F. tularensis, F. novicida and F. hispaniensis, and another including F. philomiragia and F. noatunensis. == Laboratory characteristics == Francisella species can survive for several weeks in the environment; paradoxically, they can be difficult to culture and maintain in the laboratory. Growth is slow (though increased by CO2 supplementation) and the organisms are fastidious, with most Francisella strains requiring cystine and cysteine media supplementation for growth. Growth has been successful on several media types, including chocolate agar and Thayer-Martin medium with appropriate additives as noted above. Attempted isolation on MacConkey agar is not reliable or generally successful. After 24 hours of incubation on appropriate solid media, Francisella colonies are generally small (1 to 2 mm), opaque, and white-gray to bluish-gray in color. Colonies are smooth, with clean edges and, after a 48 hours of growth, tend to have a shiny surface. == References == == External links == * Francisella genomes and related information at PATRIC, a Bioinformatics Resource Center funded by NIAID * Francisella in Cod Category:Thiotrichales Category:Bacteria genera ","title":"Francisella"},{"id":"1282533","text":"Gary Armstrong (born 30 September 1966, in Edinburgh) is a former Scottish rugby union internationalist who played scrum-half. He played for Jed-Forest RFC, Newcastle Falcons, The Borders and represented Scotland and the British Lions. His nickname is the Border Terrier.Bath, p123-4 In a 2015 series of articles in The Herald titled \\"The 50 Greatest Scottish Rugby Players\\", Armstrong was ranked as Scotland's greatest. Armstrong was known for intuitive awareness and was as much an auxiliary flanker and had uncanny talent to break around the fringes. As well as providing quick service as the connection between forwards and backs he was known for his toughness and tackling well above his weight. His fearlessness on the pitch led to two serious knee injuries keeping him out the game for lengthy spells. Armstrong captained Scotland to victory in the 1999 Five Nations and to a quarter final place in the same year's rugby world cup. He was scrum half in Scotland's 1990 Grand Slam win and his country's run to the 1991 rugby world cup semi final. He played 51 times for Scotland. He was an ever-present in Newcastle Falcons 1998 Premiership win. ==Scotland's most capped male scrum half== Gary Armstrong had succeeded a fellow Lion and Scotland cap, Roy Laidlaw, as scrum half at Jed- Forest. Armstrong was helped in his development as a youngster by Jedforest moving Laidlaw to stand off with Armstrong playing scrum half. Armstrong made his international debut in 1988, in a game against Australia building to their 1991 world cup victory. Armstrong displaced Laidlaw as the incumbent scrum half. Scotland lost 31–13 against one of Australia's best ever sides. Richard Bath writes of him: :\\"...despite his apparently painful shyness, Armstrong has proved throughout his career to be obsessively focussed once out on the pitch. A relatively small man, Armstrong tackles way over his weight and combines this with quick service to his backs and an uncanny ability to break around the fringes just as easily from the first-phase as from ruck or maul. Although Armstrong failed to shine on the victorious 1989 Lions tour of Australia, his gritty nature stood him in good stead when the chips were down in 1990, that famous year for Scotland... he perhaps more than any other player was the on- field catalyst for Scotland's 13–7 win in the Grand Slam decider against the Auld Enemy England at Murrayfield.\\" It was Armstrong's dart to the blind side that provided the spark opening the opportunity leading to Tony Stanger's try. In 1998 he captained the Scotland team again. Armstrong equalled Roy Laidlaw’s then record as Scotland’s most capped scrum-half when he won his 47th cap against Romania in August 1999. He then joined the 50-cap club when he led Scotland to victory in the World Cup play-off match against Samoa that October. Gary Armstrong captained Scotland to the 1999 Five Nations Championship, playing his eighth Test as captain as Scotland grasped pole position with their stunning 36–22 victory against France. He was skipper throughout the previous two Five Nations Championships and was also captain on Scotland’s 1999 visit to South Africa, when he played in all four matches and scored the opening try of the tour in the victory over Border. He retired from international rugby after Scotland’s 18–30 defeat by New Zealand in the 1999 Rugby World Cup quarter-final. Jed-Forest Rugby Club honored Gary Armstrong and their other two famous Scrum-Halves Roy Laidlaw and Greig Laidlaw with a gala diner on 2 August 2019. All three played for the British Lions and captained their National side. ==Injuries== Armstrong's fearless commitment led to serious knee injuries in 1992 and 1994 that impacted the representative caps he collected. It spoke volumes for his tenacity and courage that he returned to the top flight. ==British Lions== Gary Armstrong then went on to emulate Laidlaw by playing for both Scotland and the Lions, touring with the latter in Australia in 1989. ==Newcastle== He joined Newcastle Falcons in 1995/96, and his appetite for the fray was seen to best advantage when the club won England’s Allied Dunbar Premiership title in 1998, featuring in all 22 matches of the season. He also started the victorious 2001 Anglo-Welsh Cup final. Many supporters believe Armstrong to be the best player in the club's history. In Jonny Wilkinson's book How to Play Rugby My Way Armstrong is given the nickname–\\"the scrap-yard dog\\"– because Wilkinson said that he had never met anyone as \\"tough as him\\". ==The Borders== Armstrong finished his career by returning home to play for the newly created professional team, The Borders. He retired in 2004 at about the same time as Doddie Weir. ==Awards and honours== He was appointed Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2000 New Year Honours. ==Career statistics== International career: 51 caps. 1988 - A. 1989 - W E I F Fj R. 1990 - I F W E NZ1 NZ2 Arg. 1991 - F W E I R (WC) J I WS E NZ. 1993 - I F W E. 1994 - E I. 1996 - NZ1 NZ2 A. 1997 - W SA (rep). 1998 - It I F W E SA (rep). 1999 - W E I F Arg R WC (SA U Sam NZ).

It is named after the physicist Christopher Jarzynski (then at the University of Washington and Los Alamos National Laboratory, currently at the University of Maryland) who derived it in 1996. ==Overview== In thermodynamics, the free energy difference \\\\Delta F = F_B - F_A between two states A and B is connected to the work W done on the system through the inequality: : \\\\Delta F \\\\leq W , with equality holding only in the case of a quasistatic process, i.e. when one takes the system from A to B infinitely slowly (such that all intermediate states are in thermodynamic equilibrium). In contrast to the thermodynamic statement above, the JE remains valid no matter how fast the process happens. The JE states: : e^ { -\\\\Delta F / k T} = \\\\overline{ e^{ -W/kT } }. Here k is the Boltzmann constant and T is the temperature of the system in the equilibrium state A or, equivalently, the temperature of the heat reservoir with which the system was thermalized before the process took place. The over-line indicates an average over all possible realizations of an external process that takes the system from the equilibrium state A to a new, generally nonequilibrium state under the same external conditions as that of the equilibrium state B. (For example, in the textbook case of a gas compressed by a piston, the gas is equilibrated at piston position A and compressed to piston position B; in the Jarzynski equality, the final state of the gas does not need to be equilibrated at this new piston position). In the limit of an infinitely slow process, the work W performed on the system in each realization is numerically the same, so the average becomes irrelevant and the Jarzynski equality reduces to the thermodynamic equality \\\\Delta F = W (see above). In general, however, W depends upon the specific initial microstate of the system, though its average can still be related to \\\\Delta F through an application of Jensen's inequality in the JE, viz. : \\\\Delta F \\\\leq \\\\overline{W}, in accordance with the second law of thermodynamics. Since its original derivation, the Jarzynski equality has been verified in a variety of contexts, ranging from experiments with biomolecules to numerical simulations. The Crooks fluctuation theorem, proved two years later, leads immediately to the Jarzynski equality. Many other theoretical derivations have also appeared, lending further confidence to its generality. ==History== A question has been raised about who gave the earliest statement of the Jarzynski equality. For example, in 1977 the Russian physicists G.N. Bochkov and Yu. E. Kuzovlev (see Bibliography) proposed a generalized version of the Fluctuation-dissipation theorem which holds in the presence of arbitrary external time-dependent forces. Despite its close similarity to the JE, the Bochkov-Kuzovlev result does not relate free energy differences to work measurements, as discussed by Jarzynski himself in 2007. Another similar statement to the Jarzynski equality is the nonequilibrium partition identity, which can be traced back to Yamada and Kawasaki. (The Nonequilibrium Partition Identity is the Jarzynski equality applied to two systems whose free energy difference is zero - like straining a fluid.) However, these early statements are very limited in their application. Both Bochkov and Kuzovlev as well as Yamada and Kawasaki consider a deterministic time reversible Hamiltonian system. As Kawasaki himself noted this precludes any treatment of nonequilibrium steady states. The fact that these nonequilibrium systems heat up forever because of the lack of any thermostatting mechanism leads to divergent integrals etc. No purely Hamiltonian description is capable of treating the experiments carried out to verify the Crooks fluctuation theorem, Jarzynski equality and the Fluctuation theorem. These experiments involve thermostatted systems in contact with heat baths. ==See also== * Fluctuation theorem - Provides an equality that quantifies fluctuations in time averaged entropy production in a wide variety of nonequilibrium systems. * Crooks fluctuation theorem - Provides a fluctuation theorem between two equilibrium states.

Perhaps the most strategically decisive, best known, and first wartime use of specialized cratering anti-runway weapons was by Israel during the 1967 Six-Day War. The dibber bombs played a major part in the near complete destruction of the large Egyptian Air Force, mostly on the ground, in a preemptive strike on the first morning of the war by the commitment of the whole of the far smaller Israeli Air Force to the strike. The surprising elimination of the Egyptian air force and resulting Israeli air supremacy contributed significantly to the outcome of the war on all fronts. The IMI 'Runway Piercing Bomb' was a prototype Israeli-French anti-runway weapon. It used rocket braking over the target and a second rocket burst to plunge through the runway surface and explode.\\"Dassault Mirage: The Combat Log\\", Salvador Mafe Huertas, page 41, One system available from 1977 diverging from the French/Israeli runway piercing bomb development used in 1967 was the Matra Durandal, a single 450 lb bomb with parachute braking, rocket booster, and two warheads. The device worked after being dropped by an aircraft flying at low level braking by parachute, then when at the correct angle firing a rocket to impact the runway, first igniting a large warhead to create a crater and then subsequently using a smaller charge that had penetrated the crater to displace adjacent concrete slabs. The slabs, once displaced, are far harder to deal with than a simple hole that could be patched with asphalt. The Durandal has been widely exported. The Durandal was used by the USAF in the initial stages of the 1991 operation Desert Storm against Iraqi airfields, delivered by F-111s. Another, now withdrawn from service, was the JP233, a submunitions system in which an aircraft would fly over the target runway and a mixture of penetrating and anti-personnel submunitions would be dispensed to both crater the runway and impede repair work. The submunitions could be armed with delayed-fuses, meaning that workcrews run the risk of death or bodily injury as they worked on runway repair. After the UK signed an international accord banning cluster mines, the JP233 was retired. ==See also== *Cluster bomb *DRDO Smart Anti-Airfield Weapon *Matra Durandal *Fares Scale of Injuries due to Cluster Munitions ==References== Category:Aerial bombs ","title":"Anti-runway penetration bomb"},{"id":"1282582","text":"Engines and winding wheels of the San Francisco cable car systemA 2010 photograph of the power house.

It serves alcoholic beverages like wine, rakı, vodka, beer with meze and traditional foods. \\"Meyhane\\" means house of wine and is composed of two Persian words: mey (wine) and khāneh (house). The word entered the Serbian and Bulgarian languages as mehana (механа, plural механе, in Bulgarian механи) and in Macedonian as meana (меана, plural меани). In Bosnian language the word \\"mejhana\\" is used. A meyhane used to serve mainly wine alongside meze until the late 19th century when rakia established itself as the quasi-official national drink of Bulgaria. In Serbia, the word mehana is considered archaic, while in Bulgaria it refers to a restaurant with traditional food, decoration and music. == Meyhane in Turkey == The history of the meyhane starts in the Byzantine Empire. Meyhane culture continues in seaside cities where merchants stop and spend their time and money on drinking. During the period of the Ottoman Empire, the number of meyhane increased considerably. Some sultans prohibited alcohol at various times but it didn't affect the number of meyhane. While the Muslim population usually complied with the religious rules , no one interfered in the conventions of the minority population. A major part of the minority population lived in Galata and, as a result, there were many meyhane in that district. But there were also many Muslim clients who went there secretly. During the period of Selim II, the meyhane re-opened and a period of pleasure started once more. However, when meyhane opened in a Muslim district sultan mandated a new law and according to it, opening meyhane was banned in Muslim districts. In the 17th century the restaurants of what is now the Bosphorus used to be in Haliç. In these meyhane janissary clients were called Dayi and everyone respected them. While the janissaries were in the meyhane, corner boys (baldırı çıplak) and vagabonds (külhanbeyleri) couldn't enter. Even if they entered, there weren't allowed the same behavior as janissaries and they could only drink while standing. These type of meyhane were called “Gedikli Meyhaneler”. After Abdülaziz, their name changed to “Selatin Meyhaneler” Another type of meyhane was called “Koltuk Meyhanesi”. These were for vagabonds and corner boys. These meyhane were illegal. They were selling alcohol surreptitiously in grocery stores. Some of these “Koltuk Meyhanesi” were called “Kibar koltukları” and these types of meyhane served civil servants and clerks who did not drink at their home. There were also Ayaklı Meyhanesi for vagabonds and corner boys. These were mobile meyhane. Most of the proprietors were Armenians. These sellers would walking around Bahçekapı, Yemiş İskelesi and Galata. When they saw clients, they entered a grocery, poured the wine, which was warmed by their body heat, into a pot taken from their belt, and served it to their clients. Vagabonds and the others used fresh fruit as a meze. After drinking the wine they wiped their mouth with the back of their hands and left the grocery. This gesture was called “yumruk mezesi”. Gedikli Meyhaneleri of Istanbul were famous for the cleanliness of their kitchen and the skills of their cook, especially in meals of fish and meat. This type of meyhane had tall ceilings. There was also a barrel that came from Malta or Aegean islands. On the tables there were candlesticks. The meze plates were put around them. The chairs were usually short and wooden. Safa meyhanesi is the only meyhanesi today that has the same interior design as the old days. After the 1830s, Yedikule, Samatya, Kocamustafapaşa, Kumkapı, Fener, Balat, Galata, Ortaköy Arnavutköy, Tarabya, Büyükdere, Çengelköy, Üsküdar and Kadıköy became popular with their meyhane. Until the 1850s, clients preferred wine to rakı; however in those years rakı became more popular and thus meyhane changed to a place where people drank rakı. During the Republic period, meyhane in Galata started to close and new ones opened, particularly in Beyoğlu. Meyhane started to open in Asmalımescit, Çiçek Pasajı and Krepen Pasajı since 1930 and were popular until the 1980s. During that period, the tables were covered by white table cloths and the clients wore neckties. Although there weren't too many types of meze, they were all prepared in the restaurant. Besides meze some of them had fish and some of them had grilled food. The owners of the meyhane began their work in meyhane when they were young. Meyhane always remembered their owners which they called barba and usually were from minority population. Most of the minority, especially Greeks, had to leave the country due to the population exchange. In the 1980s, bars and beerhouses became popular and meyhane lost their popularity. Also, when the Barbas left the country, new meyhane owners didn't follow the traditional meyhane culture and the quality level of meyhane dropped. Years later, trying to make meyhane popular again, meyhane owners raised the number of meze and meals and started to offer new activities like fasıl. === Cuisine === A typical menu in a meyhane: * Haydari * Cacık * Patlıcan salatası (eggplant salad) * Semizotu with garlic yogurt sauce * Pilaki (beans) * White cheese * Melon * Seafood; octopus, shrimp, marinated sea bass * Wine * Rakı ==References== Category:Turkish culture Category:Iranian culture Category:Balkan culture Category:Types of drinking establishment ","title":"Meyhane"},{"id":"1282593","text":"The Incredibly True Adventure of Two Girls in Love is a 1995 American film, written and directed by Maria Maggenti and starring Laurel Holloman, Nicole Ari Parker, and Maggie Moore. It tells the story of two very different high school girls who fall in love. ==Plot== It is spring. Randy Dean is a 17-year- old student in her final year with poor grades, only one friend - Frank, a gay Latino - secret cigarette and marijuana habits and a cashier's job at a gas station with fellow worker Regina. Shunned by other students for her tomboyish personality and appearance, she spends most of her free time either by herself or in illicit meetings with her romantic partner Wendy, a married woman who drops by the gas station when it pleases her, even though Randy knows they are in a dead-end relationship. Randy lives with her lesbian aunt Rebecca and her girlfriend Vicky in their trailer, as well as Rebecca's ex-girlfriend Lena, who has no place to stay and is living with them until she finds somewhere else she can go to. One day Evie Roy stops in a pristine Range Rover, unsure if her tires need air. Randy recognizes her from school and talks to her for the first time. Evie is an only child living with her well-off, cultured mother, Evelyn, who has a difficult relationship with her remarried husband. Randy and Evie start passing notes in school and hanging out with each other, although Evie does not reveal this to her cliquish friends. During this time, Randy is approached by Wendy's jealous husband Ali at the gas station, who grabs Randy and warns her to stay away from his wife. Randy spends much of her time with Evie hanging out in meadows, trading music (opera and Mozart from Evie, punk rock from Randy) and talking. When Wendy next visits her, Randy rejects her, telling her she has a new girlfriend, Evie. Evie breaks up with her boyfriend Hayjay after he complains of her distant attitude towards him. Later, apparently on a spur of the moment, she lends Randy a copy of Walt Whitman’s Leaves of Grass, which Randy starts to devour. Inviting Evie to her family’s small house for dinner one evening, Randy reveals to her that she has lived with Rebecca and Vicky since Randy's devoutly religious mother abandoned her to devote all her time to an Operation Rescue-like group. On the front steps of Rebecca's house, they kiss for the first time. Evie records it in her diary later, apparently wondering what it all means. Randy and Evie experiment with how \\"out\\" they can be as lesbians, nervously holding hands at a local diner. Remembering Randy’s warning of how intolerant the town can be, Evie nevertheless breaks the news to her three closest friends. One girl is supportive (if confused), but the other two are hostile to the idea: one of them says, “God, Evie, if you were gonna turn gay you think you could at least choose someone who’s pretty.” Meanwhile, Randy's grades continue to plummet and the school warns her she will not graduate; Randy hides this information from Rebecca. When Evie's mother leaves on a business trip, the girls take the opportunity to cook a huge meal, indulging in wine and marijuana. That night, they make love, then fall asleep in Evie's mother's bed. The next morning, it is Evie's 18th birthday; Evelyn returns prematurely with presents for her, but is shocked by the mess in the kitchen and the rest of the house. Furiously searching the upstairs, she discovers Evie and Randy, but only realizes Randy is a girl when she runs past her on her way out. Rebecca, who has learned that Randy will not be graduating high school, goes over to go to Frank's house with Vicky and Lena, where Randy had told them she would be staying the night. Rebecca threatens Frank until, panicked, he turns over Evie's phone number. She calls, but Evie and Randy have already absconded and she is left talking to a furious Evelyn. Evie and Randy, crying, scared and accusatory, take refuge in a motel. Randy finally calls Wendy, who comes out, pays for the room and tries to comfort the girls. Ali sees her car in the parking lot, however, and comes bursting in, eventually attracting Evelyn, Rebecca, Vicky, Lena, Frank, and Evie's three friends, who were driving past reading aloud from Rita Mae Brown’s Rubyfruit Jungle (apparently still processing Evie’s news). The movie ends with Randy and Evie kissing and hugging in the open motel room doorway while everyone else argues in the background at top volume. ==Cast== ===Principal cast=== *Laurel Holloman – Randall \\"Randy\\" Dean *Nicole Ari Parker – Evelyn \\"Evie\\" Roy Jr *Maggie Moore – Wendy *Kate Stafford – Rebecca Dean *Sabrina Artel – Vicky *Nelson Rodríguez – Frank *Dale Dickey – Regina *Katlin Tyler – Girl #1 *Anna Padgett – Girl #2 *Chelsea Cattouse # 3 *John Elsen – Ali, Wendy's husband *Stephanie Berry – Evelyn Roy ===Supporting/others=== *Toby Poser – Lena *Andrew Wright – Hayjay *Babs Davy – Waitress *Lillian Kiesler – Old Lady #1 *Maryette Charlton – Old Lady #2 ==Production== Maggenti had started a script with an image in her head of a tomboy with love notes in her back pocket, and gradually added more characters such as the tomboy's family and her love interest. Later, she realized this character was based on her first girlfriend. Between 1992 and 1994 her script, \\"a dark look at the middle and end of the girls' relationship\\", grew until Maggenti abandoned it. However, the film's future associate producer, Melissa Painter, convinced Maggenti to shop the story around as an independent film - two producers wanted a pivotal element which would make two very different girls cross paths, and Maggenti then improvised the story that formed the beginning of their relationship. The producers were delighted with this, so Maggenti wrote a new script which she finished in eight days. She found she had surprised herself in that her script was now a comedic farce; the story wasn't about gay love or coming out, but about first love between teenagers. Shooting was completed in 21 days during the summer of 1994. Scenes taking place at Randy and Evie's high school were filmed in divisions of The Horace Mann School, in Riverdale, Bronx. ==Release and reception== The Incredibly True Adventure of Two Girls in Love was originally released on June 16, 1995 in the United States, with the film being released into Australian theatres on March 28, 1996 and UK theatres on September 10, 1996. It generated good notices and publicity at the 1995 Sundance Film Festival, where the film was released on January 23.

Bear Flag Elementary school (K-6), the original elementary school serving the area since 1964, closed in 2007. ==Development and History== considerred Before settlement the Pocket-Greenhaven area was a riparian forest with woods of deciduous broadleafs growing beside the river and streams in the bend. The center of the bend is a few feet lower than sea level, and drainage was all toward the swampy, tule-filled middle. The bend is 6.8 square miles, has highly fertile alluvium soil, and contains a clay pit that is now known as Greenhaven Lake. Before Europeans came, the Maidu Native American Indian tribe most likely inhabited the bend in the summer months when they could fish and hunt. Longtime residents say the bend contains a number of mounds, suggesting that the Maidu also buried their dead here. John Sutter and his crew likely passed by the Pocket-Greenhaven area on their way to establish New Helvetia and Sutter's Fort. After the Gold Rush, immigrants and former miners began to inhabit the bend. Several Portuguese families were the first settlers to the area. They raised cattle, hogs, and chickens and grew wheat and barley in the fertile soil and engaged in dairying. For the most part, early white settlers did not buy land in the bend because it was considered to be swamp land. The majority of the inhabitants found in the area before its development were Portuguese immigrants from a group of islands called the Azores as well as Chinese. This was a sparsely populated farming area until the mid-20th century when developers had a vision for this river community. Most were farmers who drained their farmland and produced lettuce, cabbage, grain, onions, potatoes, tomatoes, sugar beets, milo, spinach, asparagus, and raised chickens, pigs and cows. They also had pear, walnut and orange orchards and grew hay to be pressed for sale. These farmers were basically subsistence farmers, the crops were grown for their family's survival. Later crops were sold to stores in downtown Sacramento and to miners during the Comstock Lode. Other economic activity by the Portuguese included a gasoline service station owned by Frank Enos; Grangers Dairy, owned by the Seamas Family; Da Rosa Grocery store, owned by the Da Rosa family; Pimentel's Ingleside Cafe owned by Tony Pimentel (this cafe is now known as \\"The Trap\\"); a slaughterhouse owned by Faustino Silva, and Frank & George Rogers Trucking Co., which delivered hay and produce to customers. The Portuguese created their own schools, known as Upper and Lower Lisbon Schools, so that their children could receive an education and at the same time stay close to their cultural roots. Levees along the Sacramento River were built and maintained by the Portuguese. One major flood, the Edwards levee break in 1904, occurred while the Portuguese farmed the area. Ferries were then available to transport people to the town of Freeport and across the river to West Sacramento. Some rides were free, while others cost a quarter. Within the bend, the Portuguese led their way of life as though they lived in the old country. They celebrated the Holy Ghost festas annually, attended their community church, St. Mary's, every Sunday, and displayed a communal affection for a landscape that reminded them of their homeland. According to Mary Tash and her daughter Lucille Carter, in the old days people would leave their farming equipment on the comers of their parcels of land so that others could use the equipment. It was a community of trust and helping others through difficult times that is less apparent in today's society. The Pocket-Greenhaven area had a brickyard within its boundaries. The Sacramento Brickyard Co. was established in 1854 and was considered to be the first brickyard in Northern California. In its earlier days, Chinese migrant laborers dug clay out of the clay pit and hauled it by mule to the brickyard. The brickyard was strategically placed next to the river so bricks could be transported easily to downtown Sacramento and San Francisco. Bricks from this yard were used for the foundation of the State Capitol. the Memorial Auditorium, and other well-known buildings in the region. After World War I, a sizeable Japanese population came to the bend and established a peaceful co- existence with the Portuguese community. The area continued on as a sparsely inhabited farming community until mid-century plans were beginning to be formulated for the area. In 1958 the first developers, The Lincoln and Parker Development Co. bought the King and Zacharias ranches acquiring more than 700 acres in the area for a \\"planned community\\" known as \\"Greenhaven 70.\\" Before any subdivision could be approved by the city, however, Lincoln & Parker was required to present their proposed plan for the Pocket's entire 4,674 acres. This plan was known as the Pocket Area General Development Plan and included schools, a shopping center, two churches, a hospital with medical offices, a social-cultural center with a library and a theater, gas stations, a teen center, an open space pavilion, a heliport, a nursery, a motel, a hotel, various shops, a firehouse and a restaurant. 1959 Following the annexation of the area in 1959, the Greenhaven area was incorporated into the City of Sacramento. The city's Planning Commission passed the general development plan for the area on July 11, 1961. On Sept. 7 of that year, the city council adopted the plan. After this, the land was assessed and zoned urban even though it was still agricultural, causing higher property taxes for the farmers. Many of the farmers could not keep up with these higher taxes due to less profitability in farming and had to sell their land. 1961–62 the new \\"Greenhaven 70\\"'' project was acclaimed in 1962 the \\"Best Planned Community of the Year\\" by the National Association of Home Builders. An advertisement from the same year recognizes Greenhaven 70 as \\"the start of tomorrow\\" and notes that this then-future community will present \\"a new and better way of living for the entire family.\\" The name \\"Greenhaven 70\\" was coined as the development would center around the long greenbelt (known as Frank Seymore Park,) between Greenhaven and Havenside Drives on the East & West and Riverside Blvd. and Gloria Drive on the North and South. The completion of this planned community was scheduled to be in 1970. At that time the only way into the River community were Riverside Road, (now Blvd.) on the northern edge wrapping around to its southern edge. The southernmost edge would later be named Pocket Road. A sales office was established at Greenhaven Drive and Riverside Blvd. to showcase the plans for the \\"Greenhaven 70\\" development and to sell the lots for semi-custom built homes & duplexes. Parker, Lincoln, Dronberger, Harris, and Machado were some of the first builders to this newly planned community. Greenhaven Drive was the major through-fare which then ended at Moonlit Circle. Ground breaking by home builders in the new \\"Greenhaven 70\\" community began in 1961–62 with the first home in 1961 being built at 9 Moonlit Circle. A spec home was constructed at 805 Royal Garden Ave. because of the home's challenging floor plan, which later included a second story addition, was not immediately sold. Another at 819 Royal Garden Ave. was built for Bill Hallisey, a former conservationist for the state Department of Agriculture. 1962 saw 5–6 homes completed on the 6200–6300 block of Greenhaven Drive, and over 21 being completed on the north side of Moonlit Circle. McKay Construction Co. purchased continuous lots on Moonlit Circle and built homes on almost the entire street, some of the residents were concerned that these houses would be tract houses and would detract from the standards of the original plans for the area. The rest of the area was still rambling fields. Some of the first original homeowners of \\"Greenhaven 70\\" were: (1)Antone \\"Tony\\" Terra, (2)Bob Bos, (3)Norman Greenslate, (4)Bob Dias, (5)Richard Corum, (6)Even Zacharias, (7)Ellsworth \\"Jack\\" Zacharias (8)Norman Magee, (9)The Files Family, (10)The Parsons Family and (11)The Schumacher Family. With the signing of sales contracts for Greenhaven 70 lots, the purchasers were required to sign an agreement that listed restrictions pertaining to the building and maintenance of their homes. The establishment of the Greenhaven Homeowners Association was formed to enforce the subdivision's restrictions, underground utility and telephone lines would be installed making it so no overhead wiring to homes or television antennas would be visible. This agreement required property owners to place their television antennas either horizontally across the lower part of their rooflines or set them inside their attic, closest to the location of their main television set. To avoid unsightly appearances, garage doors were not to be left open and automobile were not to be parked on streets for extended periods of time nor were cars to be mechanically worked on anywhere on those streets. Residents with motor homes were required to park these vehicles behind the frontage, fenced area on their property. Items such as basketball standards were not permitted anywhere on the fronts of the homes or along the streets, and garbage cans were required to be kept behind fenced areas and to not be visible from the streets. Distances from the sidewalks to the fronts of homes were standardized, along with no two driveways being allowed to be located side by side. Whenever there was an infraction of any rule, the objecting homeowner would inform the association of the violation, so that the association could ensure a correction. The Greenhaven Cabana Club at 6207 Riverside Blvd. a private swim club for residents was opened. Through the signing of the sales contracts and the restrictions papers, homeowners were entitled to a membership. Dues for upkeep and other expenses of the club were paid by home owners. A second Cabana Club – Greenhaven Cabana Club South – was later opened at 6615 Gloria Drive. 1963–65 saw a large number of homes being completed on Parklin Ave, Royal Green Ave, Starlit Circle, Royal Garden Ave. Streets were added on the west side of Seymore Park and building began on Lakeshore, Shoreline and Spingbrook Circles. Bear Flag Elementary School was opened in 1964–65 at the end of the park at 6620 Gloria Drive. The plan for the area also included pedestrian bridges for the safety of school children and residents on thoroughfare streets such as Riverside Boulevard and the future Gloria Drive extension. In 1967 John F. Kennedy High School on Gloria Drive opened its doors to the neighborhood. The proposed addition of the first apartment complexes in the late 1960s on the corners of Greenhaven Drive and extending East and West on Riverside Blvd. was met with opposition of many homeowners even though they were included in original area plans, fearing they would detract from the safety and security that all had moved there to enjoy. Home building continued to extend southward on Greenhaven Drive past Gloria Drive as the street continued in the mid-1960s into the 1970s. As homes continued to be built towards the south on Greenhaven Drive and Havenhurst Ave. a sub-area was coined called \\"Green Acres.\\" The north section of Greenhaven 70 was completed prior to its southern portion. During the final stages of the building of the last homes on the subdivision's north side, By that time, the proposed shopping center for the subdivision had been revised, because the city council had decided to nullify this small shopping center in favor of the much larger Florin Mall on Florin Road. Late 1960s-1970s The building of homes was a slower process in the Greenhaven Lake area. This portion of the area grew as streets were added and paved and model homes were opened for inspection. The Greenhaven Marina, which was proposed in the subdivision's original plan, was later rejected by the Army Corps of Engineers, because of the need to cut into the levee, which would create a greater possibility of flooding in the area. Another portion of the subdivision's original plan that was later rejected was the greenbelt around Lake Greenhaven. Kermit Lincoln filed for bankruptcy in the late 1960s, which resulted in Harold Parker and Lincoln splitting up their remaining assets, which included lots that were designated for apartments in the Riverside Boulevard section of the subdivision. The proposed greenbelt around what was to become Lake Greenhaven was affected by these turn of events and the greenbelt area was offered back to the city for a parkway. However, the city declined this offer, which resulted in this area being zoned for large lakefront lots. The old brickyard closed on January 3, 1971 due to encroaching suburban development and the selling of surrounding parcels which became Greenhaven Lake. These large custom built lakefront homes would develop their own \\"Lake Greenhaven Homeowners Association.\\" Because the greenbelt was not going to be enjoyed by all the residents who had planned on it for relaxation and entertainment purposes, the surveyor pegs for designated lots suddenly disappeared late one evening. Jack Parker, manager of Greenhaven 70, informed residents near the greenbelt area that this action was unacceptable and costly to L & P. Unfortunately for L & P, after a second set of surveyor pegs were placed on these lots, the dastardly event reoccurred much to the consternation of Jack, who became furious by the event and demanded retribution. Fortunately for the property's developer, after the third set of pegs was placed on this property, the pegs remained without an incident. But an ongoing disappointment remained in the minds of those original residents who purchased lots in the subdivision and were promised this special place to relax and enjoy. 1970s In 1969, a large billboard was erected on Riverside Blvd. advertising \\"Greenhaven II.\\" with more semi and custom built homes being built to the West towards what is now the intersection at Florin Rd. Bill Parker, who was the son of Harold Parker, was responsible for the remaining portion of Greenhaven 70 in the mid-1970s. All of the proposed 1,600 homes, which were mentioned in the original Greenhaven 70 plan, were eventually completed. And because of the loss of the marina, the plan for 1,200 apartment buildings was exceeded. The final portion of Greenhaven 70 was sold and completed by Morrison Homes, which constructed houses and streets in the loop street pattern in accordance to the original plan for the area. The 1970s saw the addition more small shops, and a supermarket on Riverside Dr and Florin Rd. several apartment complexes, and the areas first condominium development called \\"Roundtree\\" on Florin Rd. and Gloria Drive. In the mid 1970s, the section of I-5 which gave Greenhaven direct freeway access was completed with entrances and exits at Seamas & 43rd Aves. After the completion of Greenhaven 70, which is today known by its shortened name of Greenhaven, Bill Parker continued to work as a land developer in other notable areas. Regardless of the changes and disappointments of some features of Greenhaven 70 that did not materialize, many residents to the original area are still proud to call Greenhaven 70 their home. 1980s-1990s \\"The Pocket\\" The major building boom came to the neighborhood in the 1980s and early '90s with homes and subdivisions popping up yet further South and West, filling the entire \\"Pocket\\" with gated communities of custom built homes, duplexes, condominiums, apartment complexes, the addition of several parks, schools, small business and yet another private lake. It is during this time that the area became referred to as \\"the Pocket Area.\\" Florin Rd. was extended into the area, during this time Greenhaven Drive was extended through the entire area coming to an end just past Pocket Rd. The Interstate 5 freeway added 2 more on-ramps and off-ramps for the area, Florin Rd. and Pocket Rd. bring the total freeway access points to a total of four. By 1986 the last Portuguese farming family sold their land to Lincoln/Parker & Powell/Teichert Development Co. The Dutra House located on Pocket Road and Greenhaven Drive was historically preserved, largely by the Parker Development Co. (formerly Lincoln & Parker), and now serves as a Title Company. The Pocket-Greenhaven area is a dense suburban community which now completely fills the semi-circular bend of the Sacramento River. ==References== 3\\\\. Area Resident since 1963 4\\\\.

The band was originally formed in 1996 as a duo composed of Anthony Seck and Sam Shalabi. The first incarnation of Shalabi Effect released a limited edition cassette recording. In 1998, Shalabi Effect doubled in size by adding Alexandre Saint-Onge on double bass and Will Eizlini on tablas. That year \\"Aural Florida\\" was recorded at Red Rocket Studios in Montreal, and was originally slated to be a \\"side\\" of a split CD with Godspeed You! Black Emperor, produced by Alien8 Recordings. In 1999, Shalabi Effect recorded for a second time at Sound of One Hand studios in Ottawa, and by July 2000 had released Shalabi Effect, which incorporated a remixed version of \\"Aural Florida\\" embedded among the 131 minutes. Shalabi Effect continues in the tradition of live improvisation based on Middle Eastern modes but Shalabi Effect's approach has become more experimental with the inclusion of strange semi-broken electronics and a variety of odd instruments--most of which happened to be lying around in the studio where it was recorded. Returning from touring the United States in the autumn of 2000, the group stepped into the studio for the third time. This time with a mind to create an EP release that captured the mood of the tour. In fact the EP, entitled, The Trial of St. Orange, has a great deal more varied material, including a drum 'n bass mix. Pink Abyss, dubbed by the band as their \\"pop\\" record, was released in January 2004. In 2005, they released their fourth album, Unfortunately. On July 18, 2007, Anthony Seck was a guest, and music from the Shalabi Effect was featured on an unscheduled \\"technical test\\" episode of Tom Green Live. Anthony Seck was again featured on Tom Green Live in March 2008 in a segment called 'Shalabi with Cheese'. ==Members== *Anthony Seck (electric guitar, lapsteel, moog, keyboards) (1996-present) *Sam Shalabi (oud, electronics, toys) (1996-present) *Alexandre Saint-Onge (double & electric bass, electronics, voices) (1998-present) *Will Eizlini (percussions, electronics, trumpet, tabla) (1998-present) ==Discography== ===As Shalabi Effect=== * Shalabi Effect: Self- released in 1998 on cassette as 'The Shalabi Effect'. * Shalabi Effect: Released by Alien8 Recordings, June 2000.

The \\"in-the-Isle\\" suffix refers to the fact that the village is part of the Isle of Ely, once an island in the Fens and also an administrative county until 1965. The village location on the high ground of the Isle of Ely provides commanding views across the surrounding low-lying fens. ==History== The village was mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1086, identified as Sudtone. There were then 9 sokemen, 8 villeins (each with 7.5 acres), 15 cotters and 7 serfs. In 1109, the charter 51 of Bishop Hervey included Suttune in the lands recorded as being conferred upon the Cathedral Priory of Ely. According to the Ely Diocesan Register, the Manor of Sutton was established in 1292 and belonged to the Priory. In 1312, Sutton was granted the right to hold a street market each Thursday; this was held on the wider part of the High Street, outside what is now the One Stop Shop. During the 14th century, the Sutton resident Reginald de Beringhale also became a major landowner, further developing his father's programme of land- acquisition. The vicarage of St Andrew's was instituted in 1254 and the re- building of the church of St. Andrew's was started between 1350 and 1360. It was substantially completed by 1370 and has a distinctively shaped tower that is often described as being in the shape of a pepperpot. Several non- conformist chapels once also existed in the village. These included a Methodist chapel constructed in 1790, following a visit by John Wesley in 1774, and a Baptist chapel constructed in the same century. Both of these closed in recent decades, leaving the Anglican church as the sole place of worship. By 1599, the village was so prosperous that it became known as \\"Golden Sutton\\". In 1800, it had a population of about 950, quickly rising to 1,862 by 1851. Although a school had been established in the village in 1579, under William Heye, it was not until 1860 that the first purpose-built school- building opened. John Taylor was the first headmaster for the boys, and his wife was the headmistress for the girls. The school continues to this day and has expanded to serve the village's growing population. A railway station was opened in 1866, with the Great Eastern Railway inaugurating passenger-train services to Ely on 16 April. The railway line was later extended round the edge of the fen to Earith Bridge and on to St Ives, with this branch opening on 11 May 1878. The combined line was then reorganised to become the Ely and St Ives Railway. The branch to St Ives was closed on 6 October 1958, followed by the line to Ely on 13 July 1964, as part of the Beeching Axe. In 1942, with the increase in bomber operations in World War II, work began on RAF Mepal between the villages of Sutton and Mepal. The airfield opened in 1943 and remained operational for the rest of the war. During the 1960s, the Sutton Gault hamlet was the site of one of the world's first tracked hovercraft, designed by Eric Laithwaite. This hovertrain was propelled by a linear induction motor and ran alongside the Old Bedford River, on a one-mile section of air-cushion trackway. In 1984, Sutton village was given a bypass. In 2002, it won the East Cambs, Cambridgeshire and Calor England and Wales Village of the Year awards. The village has known a variety of businesses throughout its history. It was once well known for fruit-growing, but has also been a place for cheese production. Later, it manufactured road sweepers, and now it hosts a monthly auction of construction and agricultural equipment, which is the largest of its kind in Europe. In addition, a straw-burning power station was opened in 1996. == Governance == Sutton is a civil parish with an elected Parish council. Services include community meeting rooms, sports and recreation facilities, a bus shelter, a cemetery, local planning consultation, play area, street lighting, grants to local organisations and a war memorial. Parish council meetings are usually held in either The Glebe or The Pavilion on a Tuesday evening. The village was part of Ely Rural District council from 1894 until 1974. East Cambridgeshire District Council (ECDC) was formed in 1974 with administration buildings in Ely. The district council collects taxes, provides services such as building regulations and local planning, leisure and tourism, handles issues strategic to the district, and many other services. The village is represented by two district councillors. East Cambridgeshire is in turn part of Cambridgeshire County Council which has administration buildings in Cambridge. The county council provides county-wide services such as major road infrastructure, fire and rescue, libraries and heritage, and strategic planning. The village is part of the Sutton electoral division, represented by a county councillor who also represents a number of smaller neighbouring villages. The Parish Council is currently developing a Neighbourhood Plan for the parish. ==Village amenities== Currently the village has a One Stop shop, a pharmacy, a hairdressers, a barbers, an Indian restaurant and take-away, a Chinese take-away and chip shop, a pub \\"Chequers\\", a family run garage and a motor repair centre. There is also a GP surgery. The Co-Op have been granted planning permission for a new retail development on the outskirts of the village near to the A142. The old butcher's shop in the High Street is now a deli, with seating for food and beverages. Bus services link the village to Ely and Cambridge to the south and Chatteris to the north with a two hourly service during the daytime and no service in the evenings or on a Sunday. The Glebe community centre provides a range of meeting rooms used by local community groups as well as being used for private hires such as wedding receptions. It is also the location of the Parish Office which is open between 10 am and 12 noon Monday to Thursday. The Community Room is located adjacent to the school and provides an additional meeting room used by a number of local groups including a monthly community café. ==Sports and recreation== The village has a cricket club with its own grounds and cricket pavilion. Adjacent to the Brooklands Centre off the Brook, the Parish Council provides playing fields, a multi-use games area and a sports pavilion used by local football teams and other local sports groups. The village bowls club green is also next to the sports pavilion. The pavilion also hosts a weekly pensioners' lunch club. In nearby Stirling Way the Parish Council provides a children's play area. Elsewhere on the south side of the village is the Recreation Ground, previously used for organised sporting events but now used as an informal recreation and dog walking area. ==New developments== Linden Homes submitted a planning application early in 2017 which would eventually lead to more than 400 new homes being built to the north of the village. Concerns were raised about the impact of this development on village services such as the school and the GP surgery. East Cambridgeshire District Council refused an initial application for 77 homes but Linden Homes have since taken this to appeal. ==Wider parish== Bridge over the Old Bedford River at Sutton Gault Sutton Gault (Bury Lane) is a part of the parish of Sutton-in-the-Isle. The name derives from the gault clay that has been extracted from there. It comprises a few houses and farms, a guest home, \\"Grove Barn\\" and an inn, \\"The Anchor\\". The Old Bedford River and New Bedford River pass through Sutton Gault. The land between them, known as the Ouse Washes, often floods and forms part of an internationally important wetland habitat. The Americas, also known as The America or just America, is another part of the parish. Although it is treated as a separate settlement from the village of Sutton-in-the-Isle on some maps, most residents consider it part of the village and the equivalent of a street name. So far the origins of the name remain a mystery. It is known to have had its name since at least 1881 as it is mentioned in the census of that year, although the name could be much older. == References == ==External links== * Neighbourhood Plan website * Parish Council website * 2001 Census * The Anchor Inn * 1881 Census Category:Villages in Cambridgeshire Category:Civil parishes in Cambridgeshire Category:East Cambridgeshire District ","title":"Sutton-in-the-Isle"},{"id":"1282632","text":"William Bradley may refer to: * Will Bradley (1912–1989), American musician * William Bradley (Australian politician) (1881–1957), New South Wales politician * William Bradley (boxer), South African Olympic boxer * William Bradley (New South Wales colonial politician) (1800–1868), Australian politician * William Bradley (footballer) (1893–?), English football (soccer) player * William Bradley (giant) (1787–1820), tallest recorded British man * William Bradley (Royal Navy officer) (1757–1833), naval officer in the first settlement of New South Wales * William Bradley (painter) (1801–1857), English painter * William A.

A letter was sent to the late Grand Ayatollah Seyyed Husayn Borujerdi asking him for help; Grand Ayatollah agreed with the plan and donated 100,000 Rials to the center. The construction began in 1960 and by 1965 it was completed. In the same year Ayatollah Mohammad Beheshti was appointed to lead the center. During the 1970s the centre played a significant role in bringing about the political rising of Iranian students in the West against the Shah and ultimately contributed to the Iranian Revolution.

It is usually injection and prominence of the superficial blood vessels of the conjunctiva, which may be caused by disorders of these or adjacent structures. Conjunctivitis and subconjunctival hemorrhage are two of the less serious but more common causes. Management includes assessing whether emergency action (including referral) is needed, or whether treatment can be accomplished without additional resources. Slit lamp examination is invaluable in diagnosis but initial assessment can be performed using a careful history, testing vision (visual acuity), and carrying out a penlight examination. ==Diagnosis== hyphaema – showing blood filling the anterior chamber, causing a horizontal fluid level. Particular signs and symptoms may indicate that the cause is serious and requires immediate attention. Six such signs are: * reduced visual acuity * ciliary flush (circumcorneal injection) * corneal abnormalities including edema or opacities (\\"corneal haze\\") * corneal staining * abnormal pupil size * abnormal intraocular pressure The most useful is a smaller pupil in the red eye than none red eye and sensitivity to bright lights. ===Visual acuity=== A reduction in visual acuity in a 'red eye' is indicative of serious ocular disease, such as keratitis, iridocyclitis, and glaucoma, and never occurs in simple conjunctivitis without accompanying corneal involvement. ===Ciliary flush=== Ciliary flush is usually present in eyes with corneal inflammation, iridocyclitis or acute glaucoma, though not simple conjunctivitis. A ciliary flush is a ring of red or violet spreading out from around the cornea of the eye. ===Corneal abnormalities=== The cornea is required to be transparent to transmit light to the retina. Because of injury, infection or inflammation, an area of opacity may develop which can be seen with a penlight or slit lamp. In rare instances, this opacity is congenital. In some, there is a family history of corneal growth disorders which may be progressive with age. Much more commonly, misuse of contact lenses may be a precipitating factor. Whichever, it is always potentially serious and sometimes necessitates urgent treatment and corneal opacities are the fourth leading cause of blindness. Opacities may be keratic, that is, due to the deposition of inflammatory cells, hazy, usually from corneal edema, or they may be localized in the case of corneal ulcer or keratitis. Corneal epithelial disruptions may be detected with fluorescein staining of the eye, and careful observation with cobalt-blue light. Corneal epithelial disruptions would stain green, which represents some injury of the corneal epithelium. These types of disruptions may be due to corneal inflammations or physical trauma to the cornea, such as a foreign body. ===Pupillary abnormalities=== In an eye with iridocyclitis, (inflammation of both the iris and ciliary body), the involved pupil will be smaller than the uninvolved, due to reflex muscle spasm of the sphincter muscle of the iris. Generally, conjunctivitis does not affect the pupils. With acute angle-closure glaucoma, the pupil is generally fixed in mid-position, oval, and responds sluggishly to light, if at all. Shallow anterior chamber depth may indicate a predisposition to one form of glaucoma (narrow angle) but requires slit-lamp examination or other special techniques to determine it. In the presence of a \\"red eye\\", a shallow anterior chamber may indicate acute glaucoma, which requires immediate attention. ===Abnormal intraocular pressure=== Intraocular pressure should be measured as part of the routine eye examination. It is usually only elevated by iridocyclitis or acute-closure glaucoma, but not by relatively benign conditions. In iritis and traumatic perforating ocular injuries, the intraocular pressure is usually low. ===Severe pain=== Those with conjunctivitis may report mild irritation or scratchiness, but never extreme pain, which is an indicator of more serious disease such as keratitis, corneal ulceration, iridocyclitis, or acute glaucoma. ===Differential diagnosis=== Of the many causes, conjunctivitis is the most common. Others include: Usually nonurgent * blepharitis – a usually chronic inflammation of the eyelids with scaling, sometimes resolving spontaneously * subconjunctival hemorrhage – a sometimes dramatic, but usually harmless, bleeding underneath the conjunctiva most often from spontaneous rupture of the small, fragile blood vessels, commonly from a cough or sneeze * inflamed pterygium – a benign, triangular, horizontal growth of the conjunctiva, arising from the inner side, at the level of contact of the upper and lower eyelids, associated with exposure to sunlight, low humidity and dust. It may be more common in occupations such as farming and welding. * inflamed pingueculaSutphin, John, ed. 2007–2008 Basic and Clinical Science Course Section 8: External Disease and Cornea. American Academy Ophthalmology. p. 365. . – a yellow-white deposit close to the junction between the cornea and sclera, on the conjunctiva. It is most prevalent in tropical climates with much UV exposure. Although harmless, it can occasionally become inflamed. * dry eye syndrome – caused by either decreased tear production or increased tear film evaporation which may lead to irritation and redness acute glaucoma, angle closure type * airborne contaminants or irritants * tiredness * drug use including cannabisAmerican Psychiatric Association.

Washington DC: American Psychiatric Association; 2000. * episcleritis – most often a mild, inflammatory disorder of the 'white' of the eye unassociated with eye complications in contrast to scleritis, and responding to topical medications such as anti-inflammatory drops. Usually urgent * acute angle closure glaucoma – implies injury to the optic nerve with the potential for irreversible vision loss which may be permanent unless treated quickly, as a result of increased pressure within the eyeball. Not all forms of glaucoma are acute, and not all are associated with increased 'intra-ocular' pressure. * injury * keratitis – a potentially serious inflammation or injury to the cornea (window), often associated with significant pain, light intolerance, and deterioration in vision. Numerous causes include virus infection. Injury from contact lenses can lead to keratitis. eye with iritis showing ciliary flush * iritis – together with the ciliary body and choroid, the iris makes up the uvea, part of the middle, pigmented, structures of the eye. Inflammation of this layer (uveitis) requires urgent control and is estimated to be responsible for 10% of blindness in the United States. * scleritis – a serious inflammatory condition, often painful, that can result in permanent vision loss, and without an identifiable cause in half of those presenting with it. About 30–40% have an underlying systemic autoimmune condition. * tick-borne illnesses like Rocky Mountain spotted feverhttps://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/pdf/rr/rr5504.pdf – the eye is not primarily involved, but the presence of conjunctivitis, along with fever and rash, may help with the diagnosis in appropriate circumstances. ==See also== *List of eye diseases and disorders *Ocular straylight ==References== == External links == Category:Medical emergencies Category:Diseases of the eye and adnexa Category:External signs of ageing Category:Disorders of conjunctiva ","title":"Red eye (medicine)"},{"id":"1282700","text":"The Nahe is a river in Rhineland-Palatinate and Saarland, Germany, a left tributary to the Rhine. It has also given name to the wine region Nahe situated around it. The name Nahe is derived from the Latin word Nava, which is supposed to be based upon the Celtic origin for the wild river. The Nahe separates the northern part of the Palatinate from the Hunsrück. It rises in the area of Nohfelden (Saarland), flowing through Rhineland-Palatinate and joining the Rhine in Bingen. Its length is . Towns along the Nahe include Idar-Oberstein, Kirn, Bad Kreuznach and Bingen. == Hydrology == The drainage basin of the river covers an area of . Due to this relatively large area compared to the river's length high floods can occur along its middle and lower course within only a few hours, however flowing off also quickly. In 1993 and 1995 in Bad Kreuznach a flow of more than was measured and more than at its mouth into the Rhine.Hochwasserkatastrophen in Bad Kreuznach (German), Web portal of the Municipality of Bad Kreuznach. The dimensions of the drainage basin are shown in the map. Its boundaries clock-wise, beginning in the East: * the highlands of the Rheinhessische Schweiz as drainage divide to the Rhine * the Donnersberg massif as drainage divide to the rivers Selz and Rhine * the North Palatine Uplands as drainage divide to the rivers Pfrimm and Rhine eastwards as well as to the rivers Wallhalb and Schwarzbach (Blies) southwards * the Hunsrück as drainage divide to the rivers Prims, Blies and Saar in the South respectively to the Moselle in the North * the mountains of the Binger Wald (Bingen forest) as drainage divide to the Rhine towards North Lower river course near Bingen == Geology and Wildlife == The rocks in the Nahe region are predominantly of Cisuralian (early Permian) age and part of the Rotliegendes. At that time, an impetuous volcanism appeared in the region. Huge deposits of the reddish volcanic rock Rhyolite and of the more alkaline volcanic rock Andesite were left. The valleys of the Nahe and its tributaries have been being formed since 2.6 million years ago during the Quaternary, the geologically latest period, as a result of ground heaving of the surrounding mountains of Hunsrück and North Palatine Uplands. This led to a steep decline of all waters and hence to strong erosion activities. Particularly strong erosion occurred in warmer melting periods during the ice ages, when tundra climate reigned and the soil was not protected by a dense cover of vegetation. Depending on the underground, narrow gorges with cliffy precipices arose in areas with hard volcanic rocks or wide gentle valleys with flood plains in areas with soft sedimentary deposits. The frequent change between both forms is charming along the Nahe. In the Nahe valley a huge number of thermophile species appear which usually can only be found in the mediterranean region or Eurasian steppe habitats. Characteristical species of plants are e. g. Alyssum montanum, Aster linosyris (\\"Goldilocks Aster\\"), Dictamnus albus (\\"White Dittany\\"), Dianthus grationopolitanus (\\"Cheddar Pink\\"), Gagea bohemica subsp. saxatilis (\\"Early-Star-of-Bethlehem\\"), Galium glaucum (\\"Glaucous Bedstraw\\"), Oxytropis pilosa or Stipa tirsa. These plants immigrated in a postglacial warm period to Europe but became extinct in most regions when the climate changed again to significantly cooler and more humid conditions. They only survived in small but still warm and dry places due to special geographic situations. In the Nahe valley and its tributaries these are mostly rocky precipices towards South or South-East, furthermore sunny slopes with shrubs, bushes and dry broad-leaved forests. On hot summer days the soil temperatures in these places can reach 60 °C/140 °F and above with truly steppe-like circumstances. A characteristical thermophile animal species is the insulated population of the dice snake (Natrix tessellata) that exists along the Nahe. The snake is very addicted to water and captures small fishes. Places of botanical and/or zoological significance are classified as nature protection areas and accompany the course of the Nahe. For instance can be mentioned the \\"Hellberg\\" near Kirn, the \\"Flachsberg\\" near Martinstein, the \\"Heimberg\\" near Waldböckelheim, the \\"Gangelsberg\\" near Duchroth and the \\"Rotenfels\\" as well as the \\"Rheingrafenstein\\" near Bad Münster am Stein. == Tourism == Alte Nahebrücke \\"Rotenfels\\" in Bad Münster am Stein-Ebernburg The Nahe region offers various tourist attractions: Nahe cycling route – The route leads along the river from its spring to its entry. Nahe wine region – The wine-producing area surrounding the middle and lower river is famous for its white wines, dominated by the Riesling grape variety. Castles and monasteries – On the heights on both shores numerous medieval castles and abbeys can be visited, most of them fallen into ruin. Most noted are the Kyrburg Castle in Kirn, the castles Ebernburg and Rheingrafenstein in Bad Münster am Stein-Ebernburg and the Klopp Castle in Bingen. The monastery ruin of Disibodenberg, located on top of a hill between the junction of the Nahe and the Glan, was founded at the beginning of the 8th century by Saint Disibod, an Irish missionary. Saint Hildegard of Bingen, a famous Christian mystic, also lived here for a while. Gemstone town Idar-Oberstein - The town is famous for its historic gemstone mines and related trades. Some of them are open to visitors. The German Gemstone Museum boasts many gemstone exhibits. Bad Kreuznach - The baths which give the town its name contain the noble gas radon, with supposedly curative properties. The town's most famous site is the Alte Nahebrücke (Old Nahe Bridge), one of the few remaining bridges in the world with buildings on it.Brückenhäuser, Alte Nahebrücke, Neustadt  Bad Kreuznach on www.romantic- germany.info (in English). Retrieved 14 June 2018 Saline valley - Between Bad Münster am Stein and Bad Kreuznach the scenic valley of the Nahe has some bathing sites with hydrothermal and saline springs. Graduation towers, formerly used for salt production, are regarded as having beneficial health effects. The so-called \\"Rotenfels\\" (red rock), a steep cliff nearby with a height of and a length of was formed by the Nahe. Bad Sobernheim - The open- air museum of Rhineland-Palatinate in Bad Sobernheim has an exhibition four traditional villages with refurbished historic houses from different regions of Rhineland-Palatinate. The region is accessible via federal highway B41 which is connected to the motorways A60/A61 in the East and A62 in the West. Moreover, there is a railway line along the Nahe with regular connections between Mainz and Saarbrücken and stations in all bigger towns. Some to the north the Frankfurt-Hahn Airport is in the Hunsrück, offering daily flights to London Stansted and further weekly and seasonal connections. ==See also== *List of rivers of Rhineland-Palatinate *List of rivers of Saarland ==References== Category:Rivers of Rhineland-Palatinate Category:Rivers of Saarland Category:Naheland Category:Rivers of Germany ","title":"Nahe (Rhine)"},{"id":"1282706","text":"The Hole is the eighteenth studio album by the Dutch hard rock band Golden Earring, released in 1986.

During the period of the Commonwealth, in the mid seventeenth century, Puritans controlled the country and organ music was banned in churches. Many organ makers left England for the continent, including Harris' father, Thomas. It was while the family was living in France that Harris was born. After the Restoration the family returned to England. Harris grew up in his father's business and eventually became one of the two most prominent organ builders of his generation, along with his hated rival \\"Father\\" Bernard Smith. Harris had a flair for publicity and was not above using under-hand tactics against Smith. Harris's great- grandfather, Thomas Dallam, and his father, Robert Dallam, were also organ makers, as were Renatus Harris's sons, John and Renatus. John Harris was the father of Joseph Harris, a renowned harpsichord maker, who in turn was the father of English entomologist and engraver Moses Harris. Renatus Harris died at Salisbury in August or September, 1724.Scholes, Percy A. (1970) The Oxford Companion to Music, 10th ed. London: Oxford U. P.; p. 460a ==Organs of the Temple Church and Christ Church, Dublin== The rivalry between the two men led to the famous Battle of the Organs in 1684, when both were bidding for the contract to build the new organ for the Temple Church, London. Each erected an organ in the Temple Church and they hired prominent organists Giovanni Battista Draghi, John Blow and Henry Purcell to demonstrate the superiority of their instruments. Harris lost out to Smith, but in 1697, after Smith reneged on a contract for a new organ at Christ Church Cathedral, Dublin, Harris appositely installed the instrument which had lost there instead. Harris's organ, which was installed and maintained by John Baptist Cuvillie, and later Philip Hollister, was replaced by an organ by John Byfield in 1752. However, the Harris-Cuvillie organ which survived the 'Battle of the Organs' today survives in St John's Church, Wolverhampton. ==Extant Harris organs== The most complete surviving organ by Harris is that of St Botolph's Aldgate, built in 1702 - 1704, which is also regarded as the oldest church organ in the United Kingdom. It was restored in 2005 - 2006 by Martin Goetze and Dominic Gwynn, and features in the documentary The Elusive English Organ. Among Harris' surviving or partially surviving organs are those of Bristol Cathedral (1685), All Hallows Twickenham (1700), and the Worshipful Company of Merchant Taylors' Hall, City of London (1722) (Restored by Mander Organs in 1966). A Harris organ at Christ Church Greyfriars, also known as Christ Church Newgate, in London was much rebuilt by William Hill & Sons in 1838 to designs by Henry Gauntlett and was destroyed along with the church during the Blitz in December 1940. The organ of St Michael, Cornhill contains nine ranks from the Harris instrument of 1684. ==References== * Williams, Peter F.

Golescu (1819 - 15 August 1881) was a Romanian politician who served as a Prime Minister of Romania in 1870. ==Life== ===Early life=== Born in the Golescu family of boyars in Bucharest, Wallachia, he was the cousin of the brothers Ștefan and Nicolae Golescu; Alexandru G. was often referred to as Alexandru Golescu Negru (Golescu the Black), to distinguish him from his relative and fellow activist Alexandru C. Golescu (who was known as \\"Albu\\" – the White). Alexandru G. Golescu studied at the Saint Sava Academy and then in Paris, at the École d'Arts et Métiers, after which he returned to be an engineer in Wallachia. Together with Nicolae Bălcescu, Ion Ghica and Christian Tell, Golescu was a founding member of the Frăția (\\"Brotherhood\\"), a radical secret society in 1843, meant as opposition to Wallachian Prince Gheorghe Bibescu. He returned to Paris in 1845 to be a member of a revolutionary society of the Romanian students. ===Revolution and later years=== He took part in the Wallachian revolution of 1848, and were members of the Revolutionary Committee formed around Frăția. He was a secretary of the Provisional Government, and served as its representative in France after 14 July 1848 (in this capacity, he called for the French Second Republic's support in combating the threat of Ottoman and Imperial Russian intervention in Wallachia). Golescu was also active in negotiating an agreement between the Hungarian government of Lajos Kossuth and the Transylvanian Romanian forces of Avram Iancu, but his efforts were largely unsuccessful. After the revolution in Bucharest was crushed, Ghica remained in exile until 1856, when, after Russian presence had been swept by the effects of the Crimean War he returned to campaign for the unification of Wallachia and Moldavia, which was successful in 1859 when Alexandru Ioan Cuza was elected Domnitor of the two Danubian Principalities. He later served several times as minister and once, for only half a year, as Prime Minister under Prince Carol.

Discovered in 1953 by the Basrah Petroleum Company (BPC), an associate company of the Iraq Petroleum Company (IPC), the field is estimated to contain 17 billion barrels, which accounts for 12% of Iraq's oil reserves estimated at 143.1 billion barrels. Rumaila is said to be the largest oilfield ever discovered in Iraq and is considered the third largest oil field in the world. Under Abd al-Karim Qasim, the oilfield was confiscated by the Iraqi government by Public Law No. 80 of 11 December 1961. Since then, this massive oil field has remained under Iraqi control. The assets and rights of IPC were nationalised by Saddam Hussein in 1972, and those of BPC in 1975.Shwadran, Benjamin \\"Middle East Oil: Issues and Problems\\", Schenkman Publishing, 1977. The dispute between Iraq and Kuwait over alleged slant-drilling in the field was one of reasons for Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990.Thomas C. Hayes, CONFRONTATION IN THE GULF; The Oilfield Lying Below the Iraq-Kuwait Dispute, The New York Times, September 3, 1990 The oil field requires regular investment to manage its reservoir. To maintain steady output, 200,000 barrels a day of lost production has to be replaced every year. ==Ownership== The field is owned by Iraq and subcontracted to BP and CNPC under Iraq Producing Field Technical Service Contract (PFTSC). BP is an operator of the project with 47.6% while CNPC and SOMO hold 46.4% and 6%, respectively. BP and CNPC will recover a renumerated fee of $2 per barrel in profits which will account to 15 to 20% rate of return on investment. Iraqi government and BP agreed to cut the initial bidding price per barrel from $3.99 to $2.00 in June 2009. The US changed its status of forces agreement the same month, starting to depart from Iraq. ExxonMobil which also bid on servicing this field at a price $4.80 walked away due to price cutting terms by the Iraqi Government leaving BP and CNPC as winners of the contract. BP expects the costs will begin to be recovered after the production will be raised by 10% from the current output. The rehabilitation and expansion project will be managed by Rumaila Field Operating Organization (ROO) which will be staffed mainly from PETROFAC employees, a wide range of international oilfield service providers, and smaller number of experts from BP and CNPC. An estimated $15 billion will be spent on enhancing the operations at Rumaila over the next 20 years.{{clarification needed ==Production== As of December 2015, the field produces making up 40% of Iraq's oil production of . Currently ~270 production wells are operating at Rumaila. BP and CNPC intend to raise the production to within the next six years. Once this production milestone is reached, Rumaila will become the second largest oil field in the world after the Saudi Arabian Ghawar oil field. However, it is likely that the target for peak production is cut down to between 1.8-2.2 million barrels per day (bpd), the Iraqi oil ministry and oil industry sources said. Production Facilities Oil production is operated by Rumaila Operating Organisation, with 14 \\"degassing stations\\" currently installed - 7 in the North field and 7 in the South field. These stations provide 3-phase separation (oil, water & natural gas). Crude oil is sent by pipeline to local refineries or ports in Basrah for export. Natural gas is provided to the Basrah Gas Company. Water is disposed into disposal wells. Degassing station names: * North Rumaila: DS1, DS2, DS3, DS4, DS5, NIDS, SIDS * South Rumaila: Markezia (Rumaila), Janubia, Shamyah, Qurainat, Mishrif Shamyah, Mishrif Qurainat, Ratqa ;Drilling contracts In early 2010, BP subcontracted deals valued at around $500 million to Weatherford International, consortium of Schlumberger and Iraqi Drilling Co, and Daqing Oilfield Company Limited from China to drill 49 new wells at Rumaila. Weatherford is going to drill seven wells while partnership of Schlumberger and Iraqi Drilling Co, and Daqing Oil Field Co will drill 21 wells each. In February 2011, Conceptual Design, Front End Engineering Design (FEED), Minimum Work Obligations and Integrated Project Management Team (IPMT) services contract was awarded to WorleyParsons ==Reservoir== Rumaila reportedly holds an estimated of oil; which accounts for 12% of Iraq's oil reserves, estimated at 143.1 billion barrels. The oil sits approximately below the surface which is considered an easy target for production. At current production rate of 1,330,000 barrels per day (211,000 m3/d), the reserves-to-production ratio is 35 years. == Importance == Rumaila oil field was critical in the 1990 Gulf War. Iraq, after accusing Kuwait of allegedly side-drilling under Iraqi soil, launched an attack on Kuwait on 2 August 1990. In addition, Kuwait had been producing quantities of oil, which were above treaty limits established by OPEC. In fact, before the Iraqi occupation of Kuwait in 1990, Kuwait has drilled only 8 vertical wells in its part of the Rumaila field and the production was limited due to different technical problems. The issue for Kuwait was territorial more than oil. Kuwait never drilled deviated wells that crossed the Iraqi borders. After the liberation of Kuwait in 1991, the United Nation border demarcation committee went back to the historical data and shifted the Kuwaiti border toward the north which meant that Iraq was producing from Kuwaiti territory. During the Iraq Invasion in 2003, the regime of Saddam Hussein laid an 18 km long defensive minefield across it, which contained an estimated 100,000 mines. Saddam also set fire to parts of the oil field.http://www.iadc.org/dcpi/dc- novdec03/Nov3-Boots.pdf http://edition.cnn.com/2003/WORLD/meast/03/21/sprj.irq.oil.wells/index.htmlhttps://web.archive.org/web/20150519003256/http://kockw.com/sites/EN/Pages/Profile/History/OilFires.aspx == Camps in North Rumaila Oil Field== There are many oil field companies camps for their staff in North rumaila oil field. *Weatherford City North Rumailahttps://news.trust.org/item/20160217180852-yifog *British Petroleum camp in North Rumailahttps://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/oct/11/basra-iraq- oil-city-transformed ==See also== *Ghawar Field *Majnoon oil field *West Qurna Field ==References== ==External links== * Rumaila Operating Organisation official website * Rumaila Operating Organisation official Facebook page Category:BP oil and gas fields Category:Oil fields of Kuwait Category:Oil fields of Iraq Category:Oil field disputes Category:Territorial disputes of Kuwait Category:Territorial disputes of Iraq ","title":"Rumaila oil field"},{"id":"1282740","text":"Page 21 of Ole Worm's Computus Runicus. The Computus Runicus refers to a runic calendar produced in 1328 and found on the Swedish island of Gotland. A transcription/description of the text - called Computus Runicus - was published in 1626 by the Danish physician and antiquarian Ole Worm (Olaus Wormius) (1588–1654). ==Description== The text consists of the 12 calendar pages and a series of additional pages with detailed explanations for finding information used in the medieval computus, including golden numbers and epacts. The calendar is written in medieval runes with a gloss in Latin and some places also in Swedish added by Worm. It follows a standard layout for a Medieval calendar similar to those found in a book of hours, with Christian feasts and saint's days. Worm attempted to identify some of the unusual symbols found in the calendar, including one marking fast days and another marking the beginning of the Zodiac months which curiously start on the 18th day of each month instead of the more common 20th or 21st. As with any medieval calendar, there is a column for the golden numbers used in the Metonic cycle (to find the date of Easter) and another column for the dominical letters (to find the date of Sunday each week). January 31 and the month of February have an additional column to be used for finding the beginning of Lent, while March and April have an additional column to assist with finding the date of Easter. The author used a similar system of rune replacements for the Latin letters and Roman numerals as those commonly found in other runic calendars, including the use of the extra runes Arlaug, Tvimadur, and Belgthor to represent the Golden Numbers 17, 18, and 19.runic calendar ==References== ==External links== *Online facsimile of original text Category:14th-century manuscripts Category:Danish chronicles Category:Gotland Category:Runic manuscripts Category:Medieval runes ","title":"Computus Runicus"},{"id":"1282741","text":"George W. Bush during the 2004 campaign \\"Internets\\", also known as \\"The Internets\\", is a Bushism-turned-catchphrase used humorously to portray the speaker as ignorant about the Internet or about technology in general, or alternatively as having a provincial or folksy attitude toward technology. Former United States President George W. Bush first used the word publicly during the 2000 election campaign. The term gained cachet as an Internet humor meme following Bush's use of the term in the second 2004 presidential election debate on October 8, 2004. ==Presidential usages== Bush used the word Internets in his third presidential debate against Al Gore on October 17, 2000: > JOYCE CLEAMER, AUDIENCE MEMBER: …I'm very concerned about the morality of > our country now. TV, movies, the music that our children are, you know, > barraged with every day. And I want to know if there's anything that can be > worked out with the—Hollywood, or whoever, to help get rid of some of this > bad language and whatever, you know... > BUSH: ... You bet there's things that government can do. We can work with > the entertainment industry to provide family hour. We can have filters on > Internets where public money is spent. There ought to be filters in public > libraries and filters in public schools so if kids get on the Internet, > there is not going to be pornography or violence coming in. In the 2004 election's second debate in St. Louis, Missouri, this time opposing John Kerry, Bush used the word Internets in response to an audience question about a potential military draft: > DANIEL FARLEY, AUDIENCE MEMBER: Mr. President, since we continue to police > the world, how do you intend to maintain our military presence without > reinstituting a draft? > BUSH: Yes, that's a great question. Thanks. I hear there's rumors on the, > uh, Internets [pause] that we're going to have a draft. We're not going to > have a draft, period. The all-volunteer army works. It works particularly > when we pay our troops well. It works when we make sure they've got housing, > like we have done in the last military budgets. The word \\"Internets\\" as used by Bush is capitalized in the official debate transcript. The official transcript follows the word \\"Internets\\" with \\"(sic)\\". The transcript also omits the filler word \\"uh\\" preceding \\"Internets\\". Video footage of the quotation shows the full version. Bush used internets for a third time on May 2, 2007: > Information is moving--you know, nightly news is one way, of course, but > it's also moving through the blogosphere and through the Internets. During a discussion on education at a Twitter-themed town hall meeting on July 6, 2011, at the White House, President Barack Obama used the term \\"Internets\\" and quickly corrected his statement. ==Reaction== On the evening of October 9, 2004, the day following the Bush/Kerry debate, Saturday Night Live parodied Bush with Will Forte's impression of George W. Bush: > I hear there's rumors on the Internets that we're going to have a draft. I > don't know how many of these Internets are carrying these rumors, but > they're just wrong. I think the problem here may be more of a question of > getting rid of the bad Internets and keeping the good Internets. You know, > 'cause I think we can all agree … there're just too many Internets. The Saturday Night Live parody was replayed the following morning on CNN's Inside Politics Sunday. Numerous homages and parodies, most including an audio or video clip from the second 2004 debate, appeared on other humor and entertainment web sites, including YTMND, and spread virally on the Internet. On his show The Colbert Report, comedian Stephen Colbert consistently referred to \\"the Internet\\" as \\"the Internets\\". On the Thursday Mar 20 2008 World Water Day Episode: #04039, Colbert's character, also named Stephen Colbert, states, > Last night, as I was surfing the Internets … literally: My backyard wave > pool has Wi-Fi …The Colbert Report World Water Day Episode: #04039 Thursday > March 20, 2008 Keith Olbermann similarly made use of the term during his Oddball segment whenever viral videos are covered. The term continues to appear as a popular topic tag on both technical and political blogs. ==Other use of \\"internets\\"== In general, an internet (uncapitalized) results from the connection (internetworking) of at least two computer networks by establishing a gateway (router) between them. It is proper to pluralize this term. For example, RFC 1918 refers to \\"Address Allocation for Private Internets\\". However, since the establishment of the Internet, this usage has been less common. A much lesser- known recorded use of \\"internets\\" actually preceded Bush's use in the October 17, 2000 debate with Al Gore by about eight months. It appeared in a sketch of the comedy show Upright Citizen's Brigade in the episode entitled \\"Music\\", which was aired February 7, 2000.Upright Citizen's Brigade - \\"Music\\" (Season 3, Episode 4) on IMDb: In the sketch, the host of a country-western music TV show tells a guest from New York City that \\"[t]here's a whole lot of things you can't learn in your fancy books and internets.\\" In 2010, in a Los Angeles Times interview, author Ray Bradbury, who was distrustful of modern technology, said \\"We have too many cellphones. We've got too many Internets.\\" ==See also== *Series of tubes ==Notes and referencesCategory:George W.

This is closely related to the philosophical concept of identity. == Identity and references == A reference can be used to refer to an object with a specific identity. A reference contains the information that is necessary for the identity property to be realized in the programming language, and allows access to the object with the identity. A type of a target of a reference is a role. Typically, references are isomorphic to memory addresses. However, multiple such references can refer to the same object, if some form of address mapping is present (virtual addresses / page tables / memory segments). Object identity is less useful as a semantic concept in environments or situations in which the structure of objects is not encapsulated, and two objects are considered to be the same object based on having identical properties, even if they are not actually the same physical instance (structural equivalence). However, object identity can nevertheless provide optimization. A function which tests whether two arguments are the same object can quickly short circuit to an affirmative answer if the two arguments have the same identity (are references to the same instance). Only if the argument are distinct objects do the individual properties need to be considered to determine equality, which is a more expensive operation. For instance, bignum integers may be heap-allocated objects such that two bignums are considered to be the same if they represent the same number. It might be a waste of machine cycles in the equality function not to take advantage of the discovery that the two arguments being compared are references to the same bignum. == Consequences of identity == Identity of objects allows objects to be treated as black boxes. The object need not expose its internal structure. It can still be referred to, and its other properties can be accessed via its external behaviour associated with the identity. The identity provides a mechanism for referring to such parts of the object that are not exposed in the interface. Thus, identity is the basis for polymorphism in object-oriented programming. Identity allows comparison of references. Two references can be compared whether they are equal or not. Due to the identity property, this comparison has special properties. If the comparison of references indicates that the references are equal, then it's clear that the two objects pointed by the references are the same object. If the references do not compare equal, then it's not necessarily guaranteed that the identity of the objects behind those references is different. The object identity of two objects of the same type is the same, if every change to either object is also a change to the other object. == Identity and object-oriented conceptual model == Identity allows the construction of a platonic ideal world, the ontology or conceptual model, that is often used as basis of object-oriented thinking. The conceptual model describes the client side view to a domain, terminology or an API. This world contains point-like objects as instances, properties of the objects and links between those objects. The objects in the world can be grouped to form classes. The properties of the objects can be grouped to form roles. The links can be grouped to form associations. All locations in the world together with the links between the locations form the structure of the world. These groups are types of the corresponding instances of the world. == Notes == == See also == * Meyer: Object-oriented software construction, second edition * * Domain- driven design: An entity is defined by identity Category:Object-oriented programming ","title":"Identity (object-oriented programming)"},{"id":"1282747","text":"Golescu may be any of several members of a family from what is now Romania: *Dinicu Golescu (1777–1830), writer *Zoe Golescu (1792–1879), revolutionary *Ștefan Golescu (1809–1874), politician *Nicolae Golescu (1810–1877), politician *Alexandru G.

He built an organ for the Chapel Royal and, in 1681, became the king's organ maker. Along with his hated rival Renatus Harris he was one of the two most prominent organ builders in late seventeenth- century Britain. The rivalry between Smith and Harris led to the famous Battle of the Organs in 1684, when both were bidding for the contract to build the new organ for the Temple Church, London. Each man erected an organ in the Temple Church and then hired prominent organists to demonstrate the superiority of their instrument. Smith hired John Blow and Henry Purcell as his organists and won the contest. Remnants of Smith organs survive at various places in the United Kingdom, though most survivals comprise only the casework. One of the best preserved cases is in the chapel of Trinity College, Cambridge. The organ that is now contained in this case (by Metzler, 1975) contains a number of restored Smith ranks. Other notable Smith cases (this list is not exhaustive) can be found at Christ Church Cathedral, Oxford, Emmanuel College, Cambridge, St Mary the Great, Cambridge, St Paul's Cathedral, London,Page 1212 The Dictionary of National Biography By George Smith; The Concise Dictionary, part 1, from the beginnings to 1900, being an Epitome of the main work and its supplement- Oxford University Press 1906 and reprinted up until 1961 and the chapel of St Peter ad Vincula at the Tower of London.

It has a railway station on the Shrewsbury-Wolverhampton Line and is near the M54 motorway. At the 2001 census, it had a population of 6,391, increasing to 6,776 at the 2011 census. With many on-going housing developments this was expected to pass 10,000 by 2020. In late 2018 plans for a second, far larger expansion of Shifnal, were revealed by Shropshire Council. The proposals, which caused considerable local controversy and led to a public meeting, included up to another 1,500 homes, 40 hectares of employment land and a bypass south of the town by 2036. Large areas of farmland would be needed for the development.http://www.shropshirestar.com/news/business/2018/11/22/business- site-and-bypass-plan-revealed-in-big-shifnal-expansion ==History== ===Early medieval time=== The town, also once known as \\"Idsall\\" (relating to potential Roman links), most probably began as an Anglian settlement, established by the end of the 7th century. Shifnal is thought to be the place named \\"Scuffanhalch\\" in a 9th-century charter, as a possession of the monastery at Medeshamstede (later Peterborough Abbey).Birch, W. de Grey, Cartularium Saxonicum, 3 vols., London, 1885-93, no.48. Though this seems a dubious claim, and the ancient charter is in fact a 12th-century forgery, the full picture is more complex. Sir Frank Stenton considered that \\"Scuffanhalch\\", along with \\"Costesford\\" (Cosford) and \\"Stretford\\", formed part of a list of places which had once been connected with Medeshamstede; and the charter purports to have been issued by King Æthelred of Mercia, during much of whose reign the bishop of Mercia was Sexwulf (or \\"Saxwulf\\"), founder and first abbot of Medeshamstede.Stenton, F.M., 'Medeshamstede and its Colonies', in Stenton, D.M. (ed.), Preparatory to Anglo-Saxon England Being the Collected Papers of Frank Merry Stenton, Oxford University Press, 1970, pp.180-1 (see also Pretty, K., 'Defining the Magonsæte', in Bassett, S. (ed.), The Origins of Anglo-Saxon Kingdoms, Leicester University Press, 1989); Bede's Ecclesiastical History, iv, 6. The first part of the name \\"Shifnal\\" is reckoned to be a personal name, \\"Scuffa\\", while the second part, from \\"halh\\", means a valley, thus describing the town's topography.Ekwall, E., The Concise Oxford Dictionary of English Place-Names, 4th edn., Oxford University Press, 1960, p. 417. Unusually, the name of the town has alternated through the centuries between Idsall and Shifnal. Idsall is mentioned in a 9th-century charter as \\"Iddeshale\\", meaning \\"Idi's nook\\" or corner. A nook is said to be an area of land of approximately . It is often conjectured that the two names of Idsall and Shifnal were names of settlements on the east and west sides respectively of Wesley Brook, a brook which runs through the town, and is a tributary of the River Worfe. In the 19th century, J. C. Anderson, in his Shropshire its Early History and Antiquities, wrote that Idsall means \\"Hall of Ide\\", and that Shifnal is \\"Hall of Sceafa\\". A Key to English Place-names has an entry for Shifnal that reads '*Scuffa's nook of land'. It was also known as Iddeshale, '*Idi's nook of land'. The oldest part of the town is said to be the area around St Andrew's Church, Church Street and Innage Road where excavations have turned up evidence of ancient buildings. ===Norman=== The village, as it would have been in 1086, is recorded in the Domesday Book within the hundred of Alnodestreu.Open Domesday: Shifnal The initial part of the entry states: > Robert, son of Theobald, holds of Earl Roger Iteshale. Earl Morcar held it.\\" This entry records that possession was lost by the Saxon Earl Morcar when he rebelled against the Norman conquerors. The church of St Andrew has a Norman chancel and was almost certainly built on the site of an earlier church. It was a collegiate church or minster with a chapter of priests ministering to the needs of congregations in outlying settlements. St Andrew's lost its collegiate status when it was given to Shrewsbury Abbey c. 1087. ===Plantagenet period=== In 1245 Walter de Dunstanville, the Crusader and lord of the manor, applied to King Henry III for, and was granted, a market charter for the town. Walter then laid out a broad market street that is Broadway, Bradford Street, Market Place and Park Street for the markets. This area to the east of the stream was known as Shifnal and gradually this name superseded Idsall as the town's name. Just outside of Shifnal are the Caynton Caves, a system carved into the sandstone. Local legend has them made by followers of the Knights Templar 700 years ago, although Historic England – the government body responsible for historic monuments - believes the caves were probably excavated in the late 18th or early 19th Century.https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-39193347 ===Tudor and Stuart times=== Old Idsall House, Church Street, Shifnal and blue plaque inset. Idsall House, Park Street, Shifnal Shifnal had something of an early industrial revolution during the late 16th century with the construction of a charcoal fired blast furnace near to the Manor House. A fire swept through the town on 7 July 1591, setting alight the roof of the church. The fire is thought to have been started by a maidservant's candle that accidentally set fire to some hanging flax. The fire devastated many, if not all, of the buildings east of the Wesley Brook. The church and the timber-framed Old Idsall House at its foot to the east (a listed building), are said to be the only two buildings to have survived the fire that destroyed the rest of the settlement. This is now commemorated by a blue plaque fixed to the wall of the house. After the fire, Elizabeth I sent money to help rebuild the town. A wall memorial tablet inside St Andrew's Church is for Mary Yates – known locally as Nanny Murphy - who walked to London as a teenager just after the Great Fire in 1666, married her third husband Joseph Yates when she was over 90, and died at the age of 127. There is a Nanny Murphy's Lane just to the north of Shifnal. The same stone memorial tablet records that William Wakely was baptised on 1 May 1590 and was buried on 28 November 1714, after living through the reigns of eight kings and queens. The best example of Shropshire Scroll – a 16th- century style of swirling wall painting unique to the county - was uncovered in 2010 by renovators in a Grade II listed property on Broadway. The 2m by 2.5m work, on display at what is now the Black Orchid hair salon, had been hidden behind a wall for more than a century. ===18th and 19th centuries=== Thomas Beddoes, a well-known physician, was born in 1760 at Balcony House, named for a room projecting above the roof line, on the east side of Market Place. This building later became the Star Hotel. Aston Hall, built about 1720 at the east side of the town, was home to tobacco plantation and slave owners—George Austin and John Moultrie—the latter rising to be acting governor of East Florida. Austin was born in the town in 1710, the son of a mercer and went to South Carolina where he became involved in developing tobacco plantations, one of which he named Shifnal, 1,415 acres next to next to the Ashepoo river and which had 85 slaves. Austin became one of the wealthiest men in the colonies, but following disputes with his business partner, Henry Laurens, returned to England in 1762 and settled at Aston Hall. (Austin was also responsible for the first person of colour recorded as living in Shifnal. In 1766 Benjamin Priouleu \\"a black servant to Mr Austin\\" was baptised in the town. Some 19 years later the parish records note that Lucy Bartlet \\"a black woman\\" was buried there.) Austin's daughter Eleanor stayed in Carolina and married John Moultrie, of Charleston, another wealthy tobacco farmer and slave owner. After Spain ceded Florida to Britain in 1763 Moultrie became a member of the new established council of East Florida, and its president. He bought some 14,000 acres and was active in encouraging Florida's agricultural and commercial development, experimenting with new crops such as sugar, rice, oranges and indigo. In 1771, Moultrie became Lieutenant-Governor of Florida and encouraged a road-building programme. He became acting governor when his predecessor, James Grant, was invalided home in 1771 and held the position until 1774. His four brothers were key players on opposing sides of the Revolutionary War. However he and Eleanor left in 1784, after Florida was handed back to the Spanish and inhabitants were required to convert to Catholicism. Selling his slaves in the Bahamas, the Moultries moved to Aston Hall, which had been left to Eleanor in Austin's will. Austin had opposed the marriage and stipulated everything was to be managed by trustees - so that Eleanor only had an annuity and her husband had no access to the capital. Moultrie died in 1798 and was buried at St Andrew's Church. A Baptist church was established in Aston Street at the end of the 18th century, but it closed down before the 20th century. The old Magistrates' Court, 1843 Thomas Telford upgraded Watling Street, the turnpike road that passed through the town, in the late 18th century. This road carried traffic from London to Shrewsbury, Chester and Holyhead for Ireland, bringing considerable prosperity to the town. There had been a regular stagecoach service through the town from 1681, but when mail coaches began to pass through from 1785 transport became important in the local economy, rising to 18 coaches a day by 1829. Passengers could rest from their travels at three coaching inns: the Jerningham Arms, the Star Hotel and the Unicorn. At the beginning of the 19th century the Holyhead mail coach could travel from London to Shifnal in 27 hours: by 1831 that had been reduced that to 16.5 hours, using 150 horses along the route. However traffic was already declining by 1844, when there were only nine coaches a day. When the railways reached the town in 1849 the remaining trade rapidly disappeared.http://shifnalhistory.org/?page_id=31 During this period of prosperity many new houses were built, lending Shifnal a Georgian air. The name Idsall was still used to distinguish the area around the St Andrew's Church and the Manor from the market and commercial area of Shifnal. There are records of a parish workhouse in operation in Shifnal in 1777 with accommodation for up to 40 inmates. A new parish workhouse was built on Park Street in 1817. It was adopted as the workhouse for the Shifnal Poor Law Union and was enlarged in 1840-1 at about £800. The number of inmates was never more than 100. The buildings later became part of Shifnal Hospital before being turned into homes. The railway line from London and Birmingham to Holyhead was constructed through Shifnal at high level in the late 1840s. The massive viaduct for the railway divided the town: its construction was a considerable engineering achievement, crossing the marshy valley of the Wesley Brook on foundations laid on coarse twigs and vast numbers of sheep fleeces. The original cast iron arched bridge was replaced in 1953 by a more functional but less attractive steel one. The opening of the line on 12 November 1849 brought an abrupt end to the already declining coaching traffic. The viaducts constructed were cast by Horseley Ironworks. In April 2018 Star Housing (Shropshire Towns and Rural Housing) began work demolishing the former Zion Baptist Chapel and magistrates’ court on Shrewsbury Road, built in 1845. Star replaced it with seven affordable homes, keeping the frontage and railings. The building was badly decayed after being left vacant for at least two decades, becoming one of the town's worst eyesores. This was despite much debate over its possible future - including proposals to turn it into offices or an arts centre. The building, which could accommodate 300 worshipers, was built through public subscription and donations from Charles King and his wife, who were buried at the front of the building. In 1855 a house on Broadway, used by the town's 200-odd Catholics for mass, was burnt down during an anti-Irish riot. Lord Stafford replaced it in 1860 with a combination school and church he built on land he donated at the corner of Victoria Road and Shrewsbury Road. The school closed about 1917, but the building has continued as a church. The present presbytery on Victoria Road, the original school-master's house, still has Lord Stafford's coat of arms above the door. ===The Shifnal Bank Fraud=== One of the biggest bank frauds in Victorian Britain took place in Shifnal when a director and staff stole almost £244,000, worth the equivalent of £16 million today. Alongside the ‘insider jobs’ were allegations of blackmail, cover-ups and fraudsters being helped to escape. The Shropshire Banking Company was formed in 1836 from four local banks – in Newport, Wellington, Coalbrookdale and Shifnal. Shifnal became its head office and Abraham Darby IV, of the historic iron master dynasty, was among its first chairmen. Initially the bank seemed to do well, paying local investors dividends of 12.5 per cent a year, and was successful enough to need new premises in Park Street, Shifnal, with heavy security measures but, in 1856, the bank was forced to write off £193,834 to cover losses through fraud. It emerged that one of the directors, John Horton, had taken an unauthorised overdraft of £10,000 “against worthless security”. Horton, who was being paid £300 a year as a director, was forced to resign. However his fraud was dwarfed by the £234,000 siphoned off by the bank's manager, Allen, and his cashier Gilbert over a decade. Although the Bow Street Runners (forerunners of the police) arrived to arrest Allen in Shifnal he managed to slip away while they were on the premises - one version has him vaulting over the counter to escape - reportedly after being tipped off by the bank's directors. Gilbert gave information about his part of the fraud on the understanding that, if he paid back what he had stolen, he would not be prosecuted. Although he returned £53,000 in cash and £87,000 worth of securities, this was still £25,000 short of what he had taken. Allen meanwhile had taken £159,000, and it appears that this was never returned: all the directors found were vague statements about speculation in mining and railway shares. The whole incident had the air of a cover-up, with the full story suppressed by the directors: newspaper reporters were barred from a crisis shareholders’ meeting at the Jerningham Arms opposite; a barrister was brought in to represent the directors and “skilfully parry” questions from angry shareholders, who were prevented from reading out statements “for some insufficient reason.” Allen was never prosecuted: a report in The Shrewsbury Chronicle says Allen “told directors he would expose them and break up the company. It would seem from the fact of him having left the neighbourhood upon the hint being given to him by some of the directors, that they are afraid of his threat.” When shareholders demanded to know why Allen had been allowed to escape the directors said “it was on best advice” and refused to reveal more on “the ground of the impolicy of telling all they knew of the past”. To cover the losses the bank's directors lent it £120,000 - £100,000 from Henry Dickenson, who took over as chairman, and £5,000 each from four others: they never asked for their loans to be repaid, and their cash injection was used as a foundation to raise more money from shareholders. Surprisingly the Shropshire Banking Company recovered quickly under Dickenson – six months later the directors were given a unanimous vote of thanks by shareholders and it grew steadily over the next few years, finally being bought by Lloyds Bank in 1874.Shrewsbury Chronicle 2 February 1855 and 27 July 1855; Lloyds Bank's in-house magazine The Black Horse. https://archiveshub.jisc.ac.uk/data/gb386-a/8 ===The 20th century=== Church Street, Shifnal Shifnal (in Red) shown with Telford. The Star Hotel was demolished after a fire in 1911. The Eight Bells or Ring of Bells was occupied in 1911 by the Pitchford family, descendants of the nobility who took their name from the area of Pitchford in Shropshire. Herbert James Pitchford ran the Eight Bells among other public houses. He served in the King's Shropshire Light Infantry, and died in Flanders in the First World War. His name appears on the Menin Gate in Belgium and on the war memorial in St Andrew's Church, Shifnal, near the Eight Bells public house. Today the building is occupied by the Oddfellows Wine Bar. Hinckesman's Brewery Co was established at Hinnington spring – just south of the town – in 1897, and changed its name to the Shifnal Brewery Company in 1899. After closing in 1910 the name was revived in 1927 before being acquired by Broadway Brewery (Shifnal) in 1934. In turn this was acquired by Banks's in Wolverhampton in 1960. The railway bridge over Market Place was rebuilt in 1953: the open spandrels of the original arch were replaced with a plain lined flat panel construction. The town expanded further during the 1960s. In 2015 it was revealed that planning permission had been granted for a total of 1,167 homes across the town, meaning its population was expected to grow by 50 per cent by 2020. The town's branch of Barclays Bank was targeted by robbers on 6 May 1991. They drilled into the strongroom and escaped with £50,000. The same bank was subject to armed robberies in March 2013 and March 2017. Its closure was announced a few weeks after the latter, leaving Shifnal without a bank for the first time since 1824. In 2009 one of the town's biggest employers, Wrekin Construction, went into administration with the loss of 420 jobs in Shropshire, Yorkshire, Northamptonshire and Cheshire and more than £45m to creditors. Among the business's assets was the Gem of Tanzania, valued on the business's balance sheets at £11m. However it emerged that the 2 kg uncut stone's value had been forged and it was eventually sold for just £8,000.Wrekin Construction directors banned after gem valuation forgery ==Culture== The Reliques of Ancient English Poetry, one of the most influential works on the English Romantic movement, was based on a manuscript discovered in Shifnal. Thomas Percy The collection of collection of ballads and popular songs, collected by Bishop Thomas Percy and published in 1765, was primarily based on a folio discovered at the Shifnal home of Percy's friend Humphrey Pitt. It was on the floor, and Pitt's maid had been using the leaves to light fires. Once rescued Percy used forty-five of the ballads in the folio for his book of 180, adding others from sources - broadside ballads collected by diarist Samuel Pepys and Collection of Old Ballads published in 1723, possibly by Ambrose Philips. Percy was encouraged to publish by his friends Samuel Johnson and the poet William Shenstone, who also found and contributed ballads. Percy's Reliques caught the public imagination, inspiring poets such as Samuel Taylor Coleridge and William Wordsworth to compose their own imitations, and inspired Sir Walter Scott. The book is credited, in part, with changing the literary movement of the 18th century from Neo-Classicism, into Romanticism, highlighting the simpler, less artificial traditions of English folklore. It inspired folklore collections and movements in other parts of Europe, such as the Brothers Grimm. Percy did not treat the folio or the texts in it with the scrupulous care expected of a modern editor of manuscripts. He wrote his own notes directly on the folio pages, amended the rhymes and even pulled pages out of the document to give the printer without making copies. Charles Dickens, whose grandmother was reputedly employed at nearby Tong Castle, visited the town on several occasions and many believe that the buildings in his book, The Old Curiosity Shop, were based on those in the town. Shifnal Historical Society report that he was very taken with the architecture of the town, and for that reason, he based The Old Curiosity Shop on the Unicorn public house, now known as Naughty Nell's. The diarist Hannah Cullwick (26 May 1833 – 9 July 1909) was born in Shifnal. Cullwick revealed less-known aspects of the relations between Victorian servants and their masters. Working in domestic service, she caught the attention of Arthur Munby, a prominent barrister and philanthropist, who was making a close study of the conditions of working women. To escape poverty, she married him reluctantly and secretly in 1873, and her diaries provide detailed information on the lives of working-class Victorian servant women. Her relation with Munby was unconventional, with bizarre role-playing, as documented in their diaries, letters and photographs as a farm girl, a kitchen drudge, a chimney sweep with blackface, a well-dressed lady and a man. She is buried, under her married name, Munby, in St Andrew's churchyard. Mary Arnold, later known as the writer Mrs Humphry Ward, went to boarding school in the town at Rock Terrace. Her schooldays gave background for one of her later novels, Marcella (published 1894). It is widely believed that Shifnal had some inspiration for P. G. Wodehouse's fictional town Market Blandings – or rather, the town is mentioned numerous times in the Blandings Castle saga. In 1968, the Shifnal Carnival was launched, a revival of the Shifnal Club Day - itself deriving from an annual parade by the 'Dove Club' friendly society. Taking place on the last Saturday of June, a funfair is set up on the main street, as well as the usual procession. In the 1990s and 2000s Shifnal become well known throughout the region for its annual Christmas lights display, which attracted visitors from the outside the town. Supported by the town council, local businesses and other organisations the lights' “Switch-On” takes place in the last week of November. In 2010, after research as part of the town plan, the Shifnal Festival was revived due to residents expressing interest for a festival of arts, culture and entertainment. It ran for three years, spawning groups such as an amateur dramatics company and a children's manga society. ==Places of interest== St Andrew's Church, Church Street, Shifnal ===Churches=== *Church of England: St Andrew's Church on Church Street has a Norman chancel with an Elizabethan double-hammerbeam roof and was almost certainly built on the site of an older Saxon church. Its churchyard contains war graves of 13 soldiers of the First World War and 4 of the Second World War, who are all commemorated by a Screen Wall memorial. *Methodist: Trinity Church, Victoria Road *Roman Catholic: St Mary's Church, Shrewsbury Road It also has, through Churches Together in Shifnal, its own Christian bookshop and drop-in centre, Oasis. ===Communal services=== A community library run by the council is located on Broadway. The Millennium Sensory Garden lies between St Andrew's Church and Innage Road and contains the town's war memorial. The garden is voluntarily maintained by a dedicated group of committee members and friends and obtained the Queen's Golden Jubilee Award 2003 and Green Pennant Award 2007/08. Shifnal Police Station, behind the library, was closed in 2013, but re-opened in August 2019 as a community cafe and gardens. Naughty Nell ===Pubs, restaurants and hotels=== The Park House Hotel, to the south of the town, is a major landmark in the town, and a venue for weddings and conferences. It was originally two separate late 17th century country houses on the edge of Shifnal. Shifnal Grammar School occupied one of the houses for some years from the 1850s. From the 1880s up to the 1950s it was the home of successive Shifnal doctors. Naughty Nell's public house, a restored 16th century coaching inn, originally known as the Unicorn, claims to have been the home of Nell Gwyn and her renowned bedchamber. It had been known by her name itself for some time. The building was sold in auction in 2011 and is now vacant and awaiting some works. The Jerningham Arms opposite, built in 1705 as a coaching inn, closed in the late 1990s/early 2000s and was turned into flats. The Royal George closed in 2015 and was converted into a Co-op supermarket. The Beehive, on Curriers Lane, closed in early 2017: its future is uncertain. The Bells pub on Church Street - which went through a rapid series of name changes in recent years from The Old Bell Inn, to Henri's then Number 12 Restaurant & Bar - re- opened in 2019 after a lengthy closure. The Anvil pub, on Aston Road, reopened in October 2018 after being bought and refurbished by Dudley-based Black Country Ales: shortly afterwards Seven on Broadway was refurbished and renamed The Crown & Anchor Inn. As pubs have struggled the centre of Shifnal has developed a growing cafe culture, with at least four cafe bars - Blue, No5, Latimers and Nan's - opening over the past few years. ===Sports=== There are several sporting facilities in Shifnal, including the Idsall Sports Centre, which is attached to Idsall School; the school, in the past, receiving a number of prominent football celebrities from the nearby FA School of Excellence at Lilleshall. The town is also home to sporting clubs which play sports including: * Table tennis * Ice hockey * Rugby * Football * Tennis * Cricket * Basketball Shifnal Town F.C. currently has a place in the West Midlands (Regional) League, whilst Shifnal United are in the lower Mercian Regional Football League (Premier Division). Shifnal formerly had a squash club and swimming pool for 35 years, but these have closed, replaced with a housing development. Shifnal Golf Club goes back to as early as 1913. Initially its course was nine holes on Lodge Hill, to the south of the town, where seven winds are said to meet. The clubhouse was then a room in a private house, Sunnyside. By the outbreak of the Second World War the course had grown to 18 holes: but in 1941 the government ordered that almost all the new holes should be ploughed over for food production. In 1963 the club moved to north Shifnal, to the Georgian country house of Decker Hill and 113 surrounding acres, bought for £25,500. The new 18 hole course was completed in late 1966. ==Education== There are several pre-school nursery and day centres in the town, as well as two primary schools: Shifnal Primary School, on Curriers Lane; and St. Andrew's Church of England Primary School, on Park Lane. The town has two further schools, Idsall School, in Coppice Green, a comprehensive secondary school; and Young Options College, in Lamledge Lane, an independent specialist secondary school. ==Notable people== * George Talbot, 4th Earl of Shrewsbury 4th Earl of Waterford, KG, KB, PC (c. 1468 – 1538) was the son of John Talbot, 3rd Earl of Shrewsbury, and Lady Catherine Stafford, daughter of the 1st Duke of Buckingham.

After the Russo-Ottoman War of 1710–11 a lateral branch of the family settled in Russia, receiving the princely (Knyaz, as opposed to Velikij Knyaz) status. In 1944 Prince Ștefan Cantacuzino settled in Sweden, where his descendants form part of the unintroduced nobility of the country.Carl Otto Werkelid, Utländska släkter med stamtavla. In: Svenska Dagbladet, 26 April 2005 online. Retrieved on 12 September 2016. ==Origin of the family== Members of the family claim that the genealogical links between the Byzantine Greek and Romanian branches of the family have been extensively researched.Jean-Michel Cantacuzène, Mille ans dans les Balkans Éditions Christian Paris (1992) . The family first appears among the Phanariotes in the late 16th century, with Michael \\"Şeytanoğlu\\" Kantakouzenos, after a gap of over a century from the Fall of Constantinople. Whether the family is indeed linked to the Byzantine imperial house of Kantakouzenos is disputed, as it was usual among wealthy Greeks of the time to assume Byzantine surnames and claim descent from the famous noble houses of their Byzantine past. The eminent Byzantinist Steven Runciman considered the latter-day Kantakouzenoi \\"perhaps the only family whose claim to be in the direct line from Byzantine Emperors, as authentic\\", but according to the historian Donald Nicol, \\"Patriotic Rumanian historians have indeed labored to show that ... of all the Byzantine imperial families that of the Kantakouzenos is the only one which can truthfully be said to have survived to this day; but the line of succession after the middle of the fifteenth century is, to say the least, uncertain.\\" The origin of the Byzantine family can be traced to Smyrna. The Greek scholar Konstantinos Amantos suggested that \\"Kantakouzenos\\" derives from , ultimately from the locality of Kouzenas, a name for the southern part of Mount Sipylon near Smyrna. Donald Nicol agrees with this theory, and lists some connections the Kantakouzenoi had with the locale in the 11th and 13th centuries. ==Origin of the Romanian branch== Cantacuzino Palace in Bucharest, Romania The Cantacuzino Castle in Bușteni, Romania The Greek Kantakouzenos family had been active in Constantinople and Greece during the Greek War of Independence,http://www.agiasofia.com/1821/fort1821/struggle3.html but several branches of the original Greek family were created via the migrations and establishment of Kantakouzenos family members to different parts of Europe. Two of those new branches were the Romanian (Wallachian and Moldavian) Cantacuzino branch as well as the Russian branch (which is an offshoot of the Romanian-Moldavian one). As a consequence of the Russian Revolution and the Soviet occupation of Romania after World War II, (between 1944 and 1947) the last two branches now mostly live in Western Europe and North America. According to Jean-Michel Cantacuzène and Mihail Sturdza, the origin of the Cantacuzino family in Romania is traced to Andronikos Kantakouzenos (1553–1601; also known as Andronik), a Greek financier from Constantinople, son of the \\"Prince of the Greeks\\" Michael \\"Şeytanoğlu\\" Kantakouzenos. Andronikos had among his several sons two who became \\"boyars\\" in what today is Romania and founded the yet-surviving new branches of Cantacuzino: * \\"boyar\\" Georgios 'Iordaki' Kantakouzenos became forefather of the Moldavian branch, which soon branched to Cantacuzino-Deleanu and Cantacuzino-Pasceanu. * \\"boyar\\" Konstantinos 'Kostaki' Kantakouzenos married an heiress (daughter) of the late reigning prince Radu Șerban, onetime ruler of Wallachia, and they founded the Wallachian branches which soon clashed against the Ghica family over power. ==Family tree of notable members== *Michael Kantakouzenos Şeytanoğlu (1510–1578) **Andronikos Kantakouzenos (1553–1601) ***Mihai ****Dumitrașcu Cantacuzino (died 1686), Prince of Moldavia ***Iordache (died 1663) ****Toderascu (died 1685) *****Ionitsa (1664–1692) ******Iordache (1688–1758) *******Ionitsa (1721–1789) ********Matei (1750–1817) *********Alexandros Kantakouzinos (1787–1841), magnate and politician **********Alexandru Cantacuzino (1811–1884), government minister ****Iordache (died 1700) *****Iordache (died 1740) ******Constantin (died 1740) ******* (1740–1826) ********Constantin (1778–1843) *********Lascar (1805–1885) **********Constantin Cantacuzino-Pașcanu (1856–1927), politician *********Nicolas (1811–1840), married to (1821–1860) **********Pulcheria (1840–1865), married to ********Grigore (1779–1809) *********Elisabeta Știrbey (1805–1874), Princess of Wallachia ********Alexandru (1786–1832) ********* (1829–1897) *** (1598–1663); married to Elena Cantacuzino **** (1630–1667) *****Parvu (died 1696) ******Parvu (1689–1751) *******Ioan (died 1749) ********Iordache (1747–1803) *********Constantin Cantacuzino (1793–1877) **********Ion C.

It was an ancient parish in the county of Middlesex that originally included the market town of Uxbridge. During the 1920s Hillingdon experienced a rapid increase in population and was absorbed by Uxbridge Urban District in 1929. It has formed part of Greater London since 1965. Much of Hillingdon is represented as the Hillingdon East ward within the local authority, Hillingdon London Borough Council. In November 2010, the ward had a recorded population of 12,403. ==History== ===Toponymy=== The name Hillingdon appears in the Domesday Book (1086) as Hillendone, possibly meaning \\"hill of a man named Hille\\". ===Local government=== Hillingdon was an ancient parish, and had within it the chapelry of Uxbridge, which became a separate civil parish in 1866. When a local board of health was created for Uxbridge, the western part of Hillingdon parish was included within it. Under the Local Government Act 1894, Hillingdon parish was divided in two along the boundary of the board of health district. Hillingdon West became, with Uxbridge, part of the Uxbridge Urban District. Hillingdon East, now governed by the Hillingdon East Parish Council, became part of the Uxbridge Rural District. Uxbridge Rural District and the parish council were abolished in 1928, with the Hillingdon East parish being added to the Uxbridge Urban District. Both Hillingdon East and Hillingdon West parishes were abolished in 1938 and added to Uxbridge parish. In 1965, under the London Government Act 1963, Hillingdon became the name of the westernmost borough of Greater London. ===Urban development=== The A40 (Western Avenue) was rerouted in the early 1990s to run slightly north of its original route, thereby allowing traffic to flow without interruption at the junction of Hillingdon Circus. Hillingdon tube station was required to be demolished in order for the new road to be constructed, and a new station was opened further south along the line in 1994, winning the Underground Station of the Year award for that year. ==Parliamentary constituency== Hillingdon is a traditional Conservative stronghold lying within the Uxbridge and South Ruislip constituency, represented since 2015 by Boris Johnson. Before that, John Randall MP had represented the constituency since 1997, following the death of fellow Conservative Sir Michael Shersby. ==Education== Primary schools in Hillingdon include Oak Farm Juniors, St Bernadette's Roman Catholic Primary School], St Helen's College, Hillingdon Primary and Ryefield Primary. Secondary schools, ACS Hillingdon, Bishopshalt School, Oak Wood School, Vyners School and Swakeleys School for Girls. Moorcroft School in Colham Green is a special school, run by the Eden Academy Trust. It was formerly located at Moorcroft Park on Harlington Road, the old Moorcroft House hospital site. ==Transport== Hillingdon tube station is served by the Metropolitan and Piccadilly lines of the London Underground. The Oxford Tube and Oxford X90 services between Oxford and central London also serve Hillingdon. Bus route U2 serves Hillingdon, operating between Uxbridge station and Brunel University. Bus route A10 connects Uxbridge to Heathrow Central Bus Station. ==Landmarks== ===Church of St John the Baptist=== The Church of St John the Baptist The church of St John the Baptist stands at the top of Hillingdon Hill, at its junction with Royal Lane. It was built in 1629, replacing an earlier building deemed to have become unsafe. In 1846, the architect George Gilbert Scott (father of George Gilbert Scott Junior) was asked to design an extension, as the increasing population meant the church was becoming too cramped. This extension was completed between 1847 and 1848 by the Fassnidge builders from Uxbridge. On 8 November 1940, a bomb fell on the south side of the church, damaging many of the windows on the south and east sides of the church. The windows were repaired after the war. The barrel roof of the chancel was renovated in 1953 to commemorate the coronation of Elizabeth II. In 1964, a vestry was built on the north-eastern side of the church. There is a notable brass on the north wall of the south aisle dedicated to John, 8th Baron Strange of Knokin and his wife Jacquetta (1509). The nearest station to the church is Uxbridge which is at the distance of 1.73 km. ===Hillingdon Court=== Hillingdon Court was built in 1858 by Sir Charles Mills as his family home, after he had bought separate adjacent properties in Vine Lane. Both buildings were demolished and the plots combined to allow the construction of the new property. The mansion remained in the family's ownership until Charles Mills, 2nd Baron Hillingdon died in 1919. Part of the estate was bought by the local authority, while the mansion was bought by the Roman Catholic Order of the Sacred Heart and became a nursing home in 1920. After the Second World War, the mansion became a girls' school, and in 1978 it was bought by ACS International Schools to become ACS Hillingdon. Under the ownership of ACS International Schools, the mansion has been extended and converted in parts to meet the needs of a school. The area of land bought by the local authority remains today as Hillingdon Court Park. ==Notable people== * Actor Michael Anderson Jr., was born in Hillingdon * Horror fiction writer A. M.

Sarakham, as it is known to its inhabitants, is in a rice-growing area on the southern Khorat plain, straddling the Chi River. Mahasarakham is 475 km northeast of Bangkok and 73 km southeast of Khon Kaen. The city has long been known as a regional education centre, the so-called \\"Taxila of Isan\\" (taking this name from the ancient Hindu centre of learning). It is home to six colleges, as well as Mahasarakham University (MSU) and Maha Sarakham Rajabhat University. Sarakham has the feel of a student town with the younger, more cosmopolitan population much in evidence in the downtown campus area and near MSU's second campus seven kilometres away at Kham Riang. For a time Mahasarakham ranked with Sisaket as among the poorest cities in Isan. This is changing, partly under the influence of the rapidly growing student population. Today Maha Sarakham possesses two cinemas, a modern department store and market, and branches of major retailers. There has been extensive building, especially on the eastern fringes of the city. Maha Sarakham has no railway station or airport, and the main transport links are via express bus, or by road connections to the airports in Khon Kaen and Roi Et.

Potential identifications have also been made in Thailand, Vietnam, and Indonesia. The first remains of Gigantopithecus, two third molar teeth, were identified in a drugstore by anthropologist Ralph von Koenigswald in 1935, who subsequently described the ape. In 1956, the first mandible and over 1,000 teeth were found in Liucheng, and numerous more remains have since been found in at least 16 sites. Only teeth and 4 mandibles are known currently, and other skeletal elements were likely consumed by porcupines before they could fossilise. Gigantopithecus was once argued to be a hominin, a member of the human line, but it is now thought to be closely allied with orangutans, classified in the subfamily Ponginae. Gigantopithecus has traditionally been restored as a massive, gorilla-like ape, potentially when alive, but the paucity of remains make total size estimates highly speculative. The species may have been sexually dimorphic, with males much bigger than females. The incisors are reduced and the canines appear to have functioned like cheek teeth (premolars and molars). The premolars are high-crowned, and the fourth premolar is very molar-like. The molars are the largest of any known ape, and have a relatively flat surface. Gigantopithecus had the thickest enamel by absolute measure of any ape, up to 6 mm (a quarter of an inch) in some areas, though was only fairly thick when tooth size is taken into account. Gigantopithecus appears to have been a generalist herbivore of C3 forest plants, with the jaw adapted to grinding, crushing, and cutting through tough, fibrous plants; and the thick enamel functioning to resist foods with abrasive particles such as stems, roots, and tubers with dirt. Some teeth bear traces of fig family fruits. It primarily lived in subtropical to tropical forest, and went extinct about 300,000 years ago likely due to climate change and the retreat of preferred habitat, and potentially archaic human activity by Homo erectus. Gigantopithecus has become popular in cryptozoology circles as the identity of the Tibetan yeti or the American bigfoot, humanlike monsters in local folklore. ==Taxonomy== ===Research history=== holding the holotype Gigantopithecus blacki molar Gigantopithecus blacki was named by anthropologist Ralph von Koenigswald in 1935 based on 2 third lower molar teeth. He noted it as being \\"der enorme Grösse besitzt\\" (\\"of enormous size\\"), measuring . The species name blacki is in honour of Canadian palaeoanthropologist Davidson Black, who had studied human evolution in China and had died the previous year. Von Koenigswald had found the teeth in a drugstore in Hong Kong where they were being sold as \\"dragon bones\\" to be used in traditional Chinese medicine. By 1939, after purchasing more teeth, he determined they had originated somewhere in Guangdong or Guangxi. He could not formally describe the type specimen until 1952 due to his internment by Japanese forces during World War II. In 1955, a survey team led by Chinese palaeontologist Pei Wenzhong was tasked by the Chinese Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology (IVPP) with finding the original Gigantopithecus locality. They collected 47 teeth among shipments of \\"dragon bones\\" in Guangdong and Guangxi. In 1956, the team discovered the first in situ remains, and third molar and premolar, in a cave (subsequently named \\"Gigantopithecus Cave\\") in Niusui Mountain, Guangxi. Also in 1956, Liucheng farmer Xiuhuai Qin discovered more teeth and the first mandible on his field. From 1957 to 1963, the IVPP survey team carried out excavations in this area and recovered 2 more mandibles and more than 1,000 teeth. Confirmed Gigantopithecus remains have since been found in 16 different sites across southern China. The northernmost sites are Longgupo and Longgudong, just south of the Yangtze River, and southernmost on Hainan Island in the South China Sea. An isolated canine from Thẩm Khuyên Cave, Vietnam, and a fourth premolar from Pha Bong, Thailand, could possibly be assigned to Gigantopithecus, though these could also represent the extinct orangutan Pongo weidenreichi. Two mandibular fragments each preserving the last 2 molars from Semono in Central Java, Indonesia, described in 2016 could represent Gigantopithecus. The oldest remains date to 2 million years ago from Baikong Cave, and the youngest 380,000–310,000 years ago from Hei Cave. In 2014, a fourth confirmed mandible was discovered in Yanliang, Central China. Indicated by extensive rodent gnawing marks, teeth primarily accumulated in caves likely due to porcupine activity. Porcupines gnaw on bones to obtain nutrients necessary for quill growth, and can haul large bones into their underground dens and consume them entirely, except the hard, enamel-capped crowns of teeth. This may explain why teeth are typically found in great quantity, and why remains other than teeth are so rare. ===Classification=== In 1935, von Koenigswald considered Gigantopithecus to be closely allied with the Late Miocene Sivapithecus from India. In 1939, South African palaeontologist Robert Broom hypothesised that it was closely allied with Australopithecus and the last common ancestor of humans and other apes. In 1946, Jewish German anthropologist Franz Weidenreich described Gigantopithecus as a human ancestor as \\"Gigantanthropus\\", believing that the human lineage went through a gigantic phase. He stated that the teeth are more similar to those of Homo erectus (at the time \\"Pithecanthropus\\") and modern humans, and suggested a lineage from Gigantopithecus to the Javan ape (then considered a human ancestor) Meganthropus to \\"Pithecanthropus\\". In 1952, von Koenigswald agreed that Gigantopithecus was a hominin, but believed it was an offshoot rather than a human ancestor. Much debate followed whether Gigantopithecus was a hominin or not for the next 3 decades until several early African hominins were discovered, placing humanity's origins in Africa instead of Asia. In 1969, an 8.6 Ma mandible from the Sivalik Hills in northern India was classified as G. bilaspurensis because at that time it was believed to have been the ancestor of Gigantopithecus. This bore resemblance to a molar discovered in 1915 in the Pakistani Pothohar Plateau then classified as Dryopithecus giganteus. Von Koenigswald reclassified D. giganteus in 1950 into its own genus, Indopithecus, but this was changed again in 1979 to G. giganteus by American anthropologists Frederick Szalay and Eric Delson until Indopithecus was resurrected in 2003 by Australian anthropologist David W. Cameron. G. bilaspurensis is now considered a synonym of Indopithecus giganteus. A male Bornean orangutan Gigantopithecus is now classified in the subfamily Ponginae, closely allied with Sivapithecus and Indopithecus. This would make its closest living relatives the orangutans. However, there are few similar traits (synapomorphies) linking Gigantopithecus and orangutans due to fragmentary remains, with the main morphological argument being its close affinities to Sivapithecus, which is better established as a pongine based on skull features. In 2017, Chinese palaeoanthropologist Yingqi Zhang and American anthropologist Terry Harrison suggested that Gigantopithecus is most closely allied to the Chinese Lufengpithecus, which went extinct 4 million years prior to Gigantopithecus. In 2019, peptide sequencing of dentine and enamel proteins of a Gigantopithecus molar from Chuifeng Cave indicates that Gigantopithecus was indeed closely allied with orangutans, and, assuming the current mutation rate in orangutans has remained constant, shared a common ancestor about 12–10 million years ago in the Middle to Late Miocene. Their last common ancestor would have been a part of the Miocene radiation of apes. The same study calculated a divergence time between Ponginae and African great apes about 26–17.7 million years ago. Cladogram according to Zhang and Harrison, 2017: ==Description== Reconstruction of Gigantopithecus with a speculative large build, gorilla-like posture, and orange hair Total size estimates are highly speculative because only tooth and jaw elements are known, and molar size and total body weight do not always correlate, such as in the case of post-canine megadontia hominins with a small-bodied primate exhibiting comparatively massive molars and thick enamel. In 1946, Weidenreich hypothesised that Gigantopithecus was twice the size of male gorillas. In 1957, Pei estimated a total height of about . In 1970, American palaeontologists Elwyn Simons and Peter Ettel approximated a height of almost and a weight of up to , which is about 42% heavier than a male gorilla. In 1979, American anthropologist A. E. Johnson Jr. used the dimensions of gorillas to estimate a femur length of and humerus length of for Gigantopithecus, about 20–25% longer than those of gorillas. In 2017, Chinese palaeoanthropologist Yingqi Zhang and American anthropologist Terry Harrison suggested a body mass of , though conceded this was likely an overestimate and it is impossible to obtain a reliable body mass estimate without more complete remains. Gigantopithecus had a dental formula of , with 2 incisors, 1 canine, 2 premolars, and 3 molars in each half of the jaw for both jaws. The average maximum length of upper canines for presumed males and females are and , respectively, and Mandible III (presumed male) is 40% larger than Mandible I (presumed female), which implies sexual dimorphism with males being larger than females. Such a high degree of dimorphism in canine size is only surpassed by gorillas among modern apes, and is surpassed by none for mandibular disparity. The canines, due to a lack of honing facets (which keep them sharp) and their overall stoutness, have been suggested to have functioned like premolars and molars (cheek teeth). Like other apes with enlarged molars, the incisors of Gigantopithecus are reduced. Wearing on the tongue-side of the incisors (the lingual face), which can extend as far down as the tooth root, suggests an underbite. Overall mandibular anatomy and tooth wearing suggests a side-to-side movement of the jaw while chewing (lateral excursion). The incisors and canines have extremely long tooth roots, at least double the length of the tooth crown (the visible part of the tooth). These teeth were closely packed together. Gigantopithecus molar The tooth enamel on the molars is in absolute measure the thickest of any known ape, averaging in 3 different molars, and over on the tongue-side (lingual) cusps of an upper molar. This has attracted comparisons with the extinct Paranthropus hominins, which had extremely large molars and thick enamel for their size. However, in relation to the tooth's size, enamel thickness for Gigantopithecus overlaps with that of several other living and extinct apes. Like orangutans and potentially all pongines (though unlike African apes) the Gigantopithecus molar had a large and flat (tabular) grinding surface, with an even enamel surface, short dentine horns (the areas of the dentine layer which project upwards into the top enamel layer), and a shallow fossa (the depression). The molars are the most hypsodont (where the enamel extends beyond the gums) of any ape. A Gigantopithecus permanent third molar, based on an approximate 600–800 days required for the enamel on the cusps to form (which is quite long), was estimated to have taken 4 years to form, which is within the range (albeit, far upper range) of what is exhibited in humans and chimpanzees. Like many other fossil apes, the rate of enamel formation near the enamel-dentine junction (dentine is the nerve-filled layer beneath the enamel) was estimated to begin at about 4 μm per day; this is seen in only baby teeth for modern apes. The third molar is smaller than the second molar. Protein sequencing of Gigantopithecus enamel identified alpha-2-HS-glycoprotein (AHSG), which, in modern apes, is important in bone and dentine mineralisation. Because it was found in enamel, and not dentine, AHSG may have been an additional component in Gigantopithecus which facilitated biomineralisation of enamel during prolonged amelogenesis (enamel growth). In the upper jaw, the third premolar averages in surface area, the fourth premolar , the first and/or second molars (which are difficult to distinguish) , and the third molar . In the lower jaw, the third premolar averages , the fourth premolar , the first/second molars , and the third molar . The molars are the biggest of any known ape. Teeth appear to have increased in size over time. The premolars are high-crowned, and the lower have 2 tooth roots whereas the upper have 3. The lower molars are low-crowned, long and narrow, and waist at the midline—which is more pronounced in the lower molars—with low-lying and bulbous cusps and rounded- off crests. The 400–320,000 year old Middle Pleistocene teeth from Hejiang Cave in southeast China show some differences from Early Pleistocene material from other sites, which could potentially indicate that the Hejiang Gigantopithecus were a specialised form adapting to a changing environment with different food resources. The Hejiang teeth display a less level (more crenulated) outer enamel surface due to the presence of secondary crests emanating from the paracone and protocone on the side of the molar closer to the midline (medially), as well as sharper major crests. ==Palaeobiology== Gigantopithecus mandible top-view Scale Gigantopithecus is considered to have been a herbivore. Carbon-13 isotope analysis suggests consumption of C3 plants—such as fruits, leaves, and other forest plants—and Gigantopithecus was likely a generalist feeder. The robust mandible of Gigantopithecus indicates it was capable of resisting high strains while chewing through tough or hard foods. However, the same mandibular anatomy is typically seen in modern apes which primarily eat soft leaves (folivores) or seeds (granivores). Gigantopithecus teeth have a markedly lower rate of pitting (caused by eating small, hard objects) than orangutans, more similar to the rate seen in chimpanzees, which could indicate a similarly generalist diet. Thick enamel would suggest a diet of abrasive items, such as food near on the ground (like bamboo shoots). The molar-like premolars, large molars, and long rooted cheeked teeth could point to chewing, crushing, and grinding of bulky and fibrous materials. Oxygen isotope analysis suggests Gigantopithecus consumed more low-lying plants such as stems, roots, and grasses than orangutans. Dental calculus indicates the consumption of tubers. The Gigantopithecus teeth from Hejiang Cave dated to near the time of extinction have some anatomical differences to those of Early Pleistocene Gigantopithecus, which could suggest a shift in diet due to changes in the environment and food resources. Gigantopithecus molars have a cavity rate similar to that of chimpanzees, which could mean fruit was included in its diet. Specimen PA1601-1 from Yanliang Cave shows evidence of tooth loss of the right second molar before the eruption of the neighboring third molar (which grew slantedly), which suggests this individual was able to survive for a long time despite impaired chewing abilities. Gigantopithecus does not appear to have consumed the savanna grasses (C4 plants) which were also common in its environment. Nonetheless, a few phytoliths adhering to molars were identified to have originated from grasses, though the majority of phytoliths resemble the hairs of fig family fruits, which includes figs, mulberry, breadfruit, durian, and banyan. In 1957, based on hoofed animal remains in a cave located in a seemingly inaccessible mountain, Pei had believed that Gigantopithecus was a cave-dwelling predator and carried these animals in. This hypothesis is no longer considered viable because its dental anatomy is consistent with herbivory. In 1975, American palaeoanthropologist Tim D. White drew similarities between the jaws and dentition of Gigantopithecus and those of the panda, and suggested they both occupied the same niche as bamboo specialists. This garnered support from some subsequent researchers, but thicker enamel and hypsodonty in Gigantopithecus could suggest different functionality for these teeth. The high levels of sexual dimorphism could indicate relatively intense male–male competition, though considering the upper canines only projected slightly farther than the cheek teeth, canine display was probably not very important in agonistic behaviour. ==Palaeoecology== Dinghu Mountain (above) may be a modern analogue to Early Pleistocene Gigantopithecus habitats. Gigantopithecus remains are generally found in subtropical evergreen broadleaf forest in South China, except in Hainan which features a tropical rainforest. Carbon and oxygen isotope analysis of Early Pleistocene enamel suggests Gigantopithecus inhabited dense, humid, closed-canopy forest. Queque Cave featured a mixed deciduous and evergreen forest dominated by birch, oak, and chinkapin, as well as several low-lying herbs and ferns. The \\"Gigantopithecus fauna\\", one of the most important mammalian faunal groups of the Early Pleistocene of southern China, includes tropical or subtropical forest species. This group has been subdivided into 3 stages spanning 2.6–1.8 million years ago, 1.8–1.2 million years ago, and 1.2–0.8 million years ago. The early stage is characterised by more ancient Neogene animals such as the elephant Sinomastodon, the chalicothere Hesperotherium, the pig Dicoryphochoerus, the mouse-deer Dorcabune, and the deer Cervavitus. The middle stage is indicated by the appearance of the panda Ailuropoda wulingshanensis, the dhole Cuon antiquus, and the tapir Tapirus sinensis. The late stage features more typical Middle Pleistocene animals such as the panda Ailuropoda baconi and the elephant Stegodon. Other classic animals typically include orangutans, macaques, rhinos, the extinct pigs Sus xiaozhu and S. peii, muntjac, Cervus (a deer), gaur (a cow), the goat-antelope Megalovis, and more rarely the large sabre- toothed Megantereon. Longgudong Cave may have represented a transitional zone between the Palaearctic and Oriental realms, featuring, alongside the typical Gigantopithecus fauna, animals such as hedgehogs, hyenas, horses, the cow Leptobos, and pikas. Gigantopithecus appears to have gone extinct about 300,000 years ago, possibly due to the southward retreat of forest and prime habitat throughout the Middle Pleistocene caused by increasing seasonality and monsoon strength, and a cooling trend. Savanna would remain the dominant habitat of Southeast Asia until the Late Pleistocene. It has been speculated that immigrating H. erectus also contributed to extinction. Human activity in southern China is known as early as 800,000 years ago, but increased human activity occurs 300,000 years ago, after the extinction of Gigantopithecus, so it is unclear if pressures such as competition over resources or overhunting were factors. H. erectus also would have been better suited savanna habitats. ==Cryptozoology== Gigantopithecus has been used in cryptozoology circles as the identity of the Tibetan yeti or American bigfoot, humanlike monsters in local folklore. This began in 1960 with zoologist Wladimir Tschernezky, briefly describing in the journal Nature a 1951 photograph of alleged yeti tracks taken by Himalayan mountaineers Michael Ward and Eric Shipton. Tschernezky concluded that the yeti walked like a human and was similar to Gigantopithecus. Subsequently, the yeti attracted short-lived scientific attention, with several more authors publishing in Nature and Science, but this also incited a popular monster hunting following for both the yeti and the similar American bigfoot which has persisted into present day. The only scientist who continued trying to prove such monsters exist was anthropologist Grover Krantz, who continued pushing for a connection between Gigantopithecus and bigfoot from 1970 to his death in 2002. Among the binomial names he came up with for bigfoot included \\"Gigantopithecus canadensis\\". Krantz met no support from neither mainstream science nor from amateurs who said he readily accepted clearly false evidence. ==See also== * Bunopithecus * Khoratpithecus * Lufengpithecus * Pongo hooijeri * Sivapithecus ==References== Category:Prehistoric apes Category:Prehistoric primate genera Category:Miocene primates Category:Pliocene primates Category:Pleistocene primates Category:Miocene mammals of Asia Category:Pliocene mammals of Asia Category:Pleistocene mammals of Asia Category:Fossils of China Category:Extinct animals of China Category:Fossils of India Category:Extinct animals of India Category:Fossils of Vietnam Category:Extinct animals of Vietnam Category:Fossils of Indonesia Category:Extinct animals of Indonesia Category:Tortonian first appearances Category:Pleistocene genus extinctions Category:Fossil taxa described in 1935 Category:Taxa named by Gustav Heinrich Ralph von Koenigswald Category:Mammals described in 1935 ","title":"Gigantopithecus"},{"id":"1282839","text":"Allegany is the name of several places in the United States: ==Communities== * Allegany County, Maryland **Allegany College of Maryland * Allegany County, New York * Allegany (town), New York, in Cattaraugus County **Allegany (village), New York, in the above town * Allegany Indian Reservation, in Cattaraugus County, New York * Allegany State Park, a New York state park in Cattaraugus County on the Pennsylvania border * Allegany, Oregon, an unincorporated community in Coos County * Allegany Township, Potter County, Pennsylvania ==Other== * Allegany Ballistics Laboratory ==See also== * *Allegheny (disambiguation) ","title":"Allegany"},{"id":"1282842","text":"Harry is a male given name, the Middle English form of Henry.

In 2015, during his fourth term, Mazăre resigned amid accusations of corruption, citing the unbearable stress caused by what he claimed to be politically motivated investigations. In 2017 he fled while under bail to Madagascar, claiming the right of asylum, but he was extradited back to Romania on 20 May 2019 to serve a 9-year sentence in prison. ==Education== He is a graduate of the \\"Mircea cel Bătrân\\" Naval Academy (Electromechanics Department) in Constanța, class of 1991. ==Career== Mazăre founded the Telegraf newspaper, the local Neptun TV channel and was a shareholder of the Conpress Holding. He joined the Democratic Party (PD) and was elected to the Romanian Chamber of Deputies in 1996. He later resigned due to \\"differences between electoral promises and [the] realities of government\\". ==Controversies== He is considered one of the top 300 richest people in Romania and was accused of being a so-called \\"local baron\\" of the Social Democratic Party (PSD). In November 2008, The Diplomat reported that the National Anti-corruption Department had accused Mazăre, along with 36 other municipal employees, of corruption, abuse of public service, forgery, and criminal complicity. The group was charged with giving €114 million ($144 million) worth of state-owned land along the coast of the Black Sea and public beaches in Constanta and Mamaia to individuals, including Mazăre's family. Mazăre was awarded 5,000 Romanian Lei in damages after the Anti-corruption Department refused to provide information about the qualification of the experts. Another controversial event took place in July 2009 when, during a fashion show, Radu Mazăre participated wearing a Nazi Wehrmacht uniform, together with his son, who was also wearing a Nazi uniform. He explained that he \\"always liked this uniform, and admired the rigorous organization of the German army\\". According to Mazăre, \\"I checked it before I put it on but the swastika was very small and I didn't see it\\". Two days later he issued a public apology to Jewish organisations, declaring that by wearing the uniform he wanted to pay homage to Claus von Stauffenberg, a leading member of the failed plot to kill Adolf Hitler during World War II. Radu Mazăre in the year 2003 introduced the \\"tax for increasing the degree of peace and security in carrying out economic activities in Constanța, Mamaia and Sat Vacanţa\\" (taxa pentru creșterea gradului de liniște și siguranță în derularea activităților economice în Constanța, Mamaia și Sat Vacanță). This tax was attacked and canceled by the prefect of Constanța county Dănuț Culețu in 2006. Although this tax was considered abusive, it was reintroduced in disagreement with 31337 debtors from Constanta, in 2009. Among the population, this tax was also called: \\"Mazăre's Protection tax\\" or ”The Al Capone Tax”. The tax remained uncontested until 2015, when the president of the ACIA, civic activist Andrei Popescu, initiated a campaign to collect signatures to end this abuse. The campaign had a real support from the people of Constanta, gathering over 7,000 signatories. In early 2015, Mazăre was placed under indictment and investigated for corruption-related offenses by the National Anticorruption Directorate. In July 2017, after nine years of trial, Mazăre was convicted and given a three-year suspended sentence for the illegal sales. At the end of 2017 Mazăre fled to Madagascar, where he owns a holiday resort, asking for the right of asylum. In May 2018, Mazăre received a six and a half-year prison sentence for abuse of power in a case related to the sale of a 15,000 sqm-plot of land in the Mamaia resort, subject to appeal. Subsequently, on 8 February 2019, Mazăre was handed a final 9-year imprisonment sentence in the Mamaia affair. In May 2019 he was repatriated to Romania under an international warrant, to serve 9 years in prison. ==See also== * List of corruption scandals in Romania ==Footnotes== Category:1968 births Category:Living people Category:Mayors of places in Romania Category:Members of the Chamber of Deputies (Romania) Category:Social Democratic Party (Romania) politicians Category:People from Bucharest Category:Romanian white-collar criminals Category:People extradited to Romania ","title":"Radu Mazăre"},{"id":"1282862","text":"Montgomery Cunningham Meigs (; May 3, 1816 – January 2, 1892) was a career United States Army officer and civil engineer, who served as Quartermaster General of the U.S. Army during and after the American Civil War. Meigs strongly opposed secession and supported the Union; his record as Quartermaster General was regarded as outstanding, both in effectiveness and in ethical probity, and Secretary of State William H. Seward viewed it as a key factor in the Union victory. Meigs was one of the principal architects of Arlington National Cemetery; the choice of its location, on Robert E. Lee's family estate, Arlington House, was partly a gesture to humiliate Lee for siding with the Confederacy. ==Early life and engineering projects== Meigs was born in Augusta, Georgia, in May 1816. He was the son of Dr. Charles Delucena Meigs and Mary Montgomery Meigs.Hannan, p. 140. His father was a nationally known obstetrician and professor of obstetrics at Jefferson Medical College.Ferguson, p. 52.\\"General Montgomery Cunningham Meigs.\\" Scientific American. January 30, 1892, p. 71. Accessed 2012-12-15. His grandfather, Josiah Meigs, graduated from Yale University (where he was a classmate of future dictionary creator Noah Webster and American Revolutionary War general and politician Oliver Wolcott), and later was president of the University of Georgia. Montgomery Meigs' mother, Mary, was the granddaughter of a Scottish family from Brigend (with somewhat distant claims to a baronetcy) which emigrated to America in 1701.Browning, p. 239-240. Accessed 2012-12-15. Meigs' father apprenticed as a physician in Philadelphia until 1812, at which time he moved to Athens, Georgia. He enrolled at the University of Pennsylvania in 1815, the same year he began to practice medicine in Georgia. Charles Meigs received his MD from the University of Pennsylvania in 1817, and that summer he moved his family—which now included one-year-old Montgomery—to Philadelphia and established a practice there.Morton, p. 508.

(then a preparatory school for the University of Pennsylvania). Meigs learned French, German, and Latin, and studied art, literature, and poetry.Field, p. 74. He enrolled at the University of Pennsylvania when he was only 15 years old.Miller, p. 6. A hard worker, he was one of the top students at the university. The Meigs family had extensive ties to the military and to West Point, the United States Military Academy. Montgomery Meigs, caught up in the nationalistic fervor of the time, wished to serve in the army.Weigley, p. 23. West Point was the only well established engineering school in the United States at the time.Herrin, p. 4. Through family connections,Wilson p. 41-42. Meigs won an appointment to West Point, entering in 1832. He excelled in his studies at West Point, although he himself said he spent too much time at athletics and outdoor activities. He was among the top three students in French and mathematics, and did well in history. He graduated fifth out of a class of 49 in 1836, and he had more good conduct merits than two-thirds of his classmates. He received a commission as a second lieutenant in the 1st U.S. Artillery, but most of his army service was with the Corps of Engineers, in which he worked on important engineering projects. In his early assignments, Meigs helped build Fort Mifflin and Fort Delaware, both on the Delaware River, and Fort Wayne on the Detroit River. He also served under the command of then-Lt. Robert E. Lee to make navigational improvements on the Mississippi River.Ulbrich, p. 1312; Freeman, vol. 1, pp. 140-47. Beginning in 1844, Meigs also was involved with the construction of Fort Montgomery on Lake Champlain in upstate New York. His favorite prewar engineering project was the Washington Aqueduct, which he supervised from 1852 to 1860. It involved the construction of the monumental Union Arch Bridge across Cabin John Creek, designed by Alfred Rives, which for 50 years remained the longest single-span masonry arch in the world.\\"Md. bridge history includes breach that couldn't be spanned\\", Washington Post, John Kelly, Wednesday, April 21, 2010 From 1853 to 1859, he also supervised the building of the wings and dome of the United States Capitol and, from 1855 to 1859, the extension of the General Post Office Building. Montgomery C. Meigs in March 1861. In the fall of 1860, as a result of a disagreement over procurement contracts, Meigs incurred the ill will of the Secretary of War, John B. Floyd, and was banished to Tortugas in the Gulf of Mexico to construct fortifications there and at Key West, including Fort Jefferson, Florida. Upon the resignation of Floyd a few months later, Meigs was recalled to his work on the aqueduct at Washington. ==Civil War== Just before the outbreak of the Civil War, Meigs and Lt. Col. Erasmus D. Keyes were quietly charged by President Abraham Lincoln and Secretary of State William H. Seward with drawing up a plan for the relief of Fort Pickens, Florida, by means of a secret expedition. In April 1861, together with Lieutenant David D. Porter of the Navy, they carried out the expedition, embarking under orders from the President without the knowledge of either the Secretary of the Navy or the Secretary of War. On May 14, 1861, Meigs was appointed colonel, 11th U.S. Infantry, and on the following day, promoted to brigadier general and Quartermaster General of the Army. The previous Quartermaster General, Joseph Johnston, had resigned and become a general in the Confederate Army. Meigs established a reputation for being efficient, hard-driving, and scrupulously honest. He molded a large and somewhat diffuse department into a great tool of war. He was one of the first to fully appreciate the importance of logistical preparations in military planning, and under his leadership, supplies moved forward and troops were transported over long distances with ever-greater efficiency. Of his work in the quartermaster's office, James G. Blaine remarked: > Montgomery C. Meigs, one of the ablest graduates of the Military Academy, > was kept from the command of troops by the inestimably important services he > performed as Quartermaster General. Perhaps in the military history of the > world there never was so large an amount of money disbursed upon the order > of a single man ... The aggregate sum could not have been less during the > war than fifteen hundred million dollars, accurately vouched and accounted > for to the last cent. Secretary of State William H. Seward's estimate was \\"that without the services of this eminent soldier the national cause must have been lost or deeply imperiled.\\" Montgomery C. Meigs Meigs' services during the Civil War included command of Lieutenant General Ulysses S. Grant's base of supplies at Fredericksburg and Belle Plain, Virginia (1864); command of a division of War Department employees in the defense of Washington at the time of Jubal A. Early's raid (July 11 to 14, 1864); personally supervising the refitting and supplying of Major General William T. Sherman's army at Savannah (January 5 to 29, 1865), Goldsboro, and Raleigh, North Carolina and reopening Sherman's lines of supply (March to April 1865). He was brevetted to major general on July 5, 1864. A staunch Unionist, Meigs detested the Confederacy. His feelings led directly to the establishment of Arlington National Cemetery. On July 16, 1862, Congress passed legislation authorizing the U.S. federal government to purchase land for national cemeteries for military dead, and put the U.S. Army Quartermaster General in charge of this program. The Soldiers' Home in Washington, D.C., and the Alexandria Cemetery were the primary burying grounds for war dead in the D.C. area, but by late 1863 both cemeteries were full.Cultural Landscape Program, p. 84. Accessed 2012-05-03. In May 1864, Union forces suffered large numbers of dead in the Battle of the Wilderness. Meigs ordered that an examination of eligible sites be made for the establishment for a large new national military cemetery. Within weeks, his staff reported that Arlington Estate was the most suitable property in the area. The property was high and free from floods (which might unearth graves), it had a view of the District of Columbia, and it was aesthetically pleasing. It was also the home of Robert E. Lee, future General-in-Chief of the Confederacy, and denying Lee use of his home after the war was a valuable political consideration.Cultural Landscape Program, p. 88. Accessed 2012-05-03. Although the first military burial at Arlington had been made on May 13,Cultural Landscape Program, p. 86. Accessed 2012-05-03. Meigs did not authorize establishment of burials until June 15, 1864.Cultural Landscape Program, p. 85. Accessed 2012-05-03. Meigs ordered that the estate be surveyed and that be set aside for use as a cemetery. ===The logistics system=== While the Confederacy never had enough supplies and it kept getting worse, the Union forces typically had enough food, supplies, ammunition and weapons. The Union supply system, even as it penetrated deeper into the South, maintained its efficiency. Historians credit the achievements to Meigs.Russell Weigley, Quartermaster General of the Union Army: A Biography of M.C. Meigs (1959).David W. Miller, Second Only to Grant: Quartermaster General Montgomery C. Meigs (Shippensburg: White Mane, 2001) Union quartermasters were responsible for most of the $3 billion spent for the war. They operated out of sixteen major depots, which formed the basis of the system of procurement and supply throughout the war. As the war expanded, operation of these depots became much more complex, with an overlapping and interweaving relationship between the army and government operated factories, private factories, and numerous middlemen. The purchase of goods and services through contracts supervised by the quartermasters accounted for most of federal military expenditures, apart from the wages of the soldiers. The quartermasters supervised their own soldiers, and cooperated closely with state officials, manufacturers and wholesalers trying to sell directly to the army; and representatives of civilian workers looking for higher pay at government factories. The complex system was closely monitored by congressmen anxious to ensure that their districts won their share of contracts. The system grew in efficiency to the point Union troops on long marches would simply throw away excess knapsacks, bedrolls, overcoats, and other pieces of clothing and equipment that they felt were weighing them down, fully confident that they would be resupplied at some point in the near future.Mark R. Wilson, The Business of Civil War: Military Mobilization and the State, 1861-1865 (2006) ===Wartime deaths=== In October 1864, his son, 1st Lieutenant John Rodgers Meigs, was killed at Swift Run Gap in Virginia and was buried at a Georgetown Cemetery.Poole, p. 64. Lt. Meigs was part of a three-man patrol which ran into a three-man Confederate patrol. Lt. Meigs was killed, one man was captured, and one man escaped. To the end of his life, Meigs believed that his son had been murdered after being captured—despite evidence to the contrary.Miller, p. 241-242. The younger Meigs was laid to rest in Oak Hill Cemetery in Georgetown in Washington, D.C. Both Abraham Lincoln and Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton attended the interment.Schama, p. 104. Meigs was also present for Lincoln's death. At 10:00 pm on the evening of April 14, 1865, Meigs heard that William Seward had been attacked by a knife-wielding assailant. Meigs rushed to Rodgers House, Seward's home on Lafayette Square just across the street from the White House.Bednar, p. 99. Shortly after arriving at Seward's home, Meigs learned of the shooting of Lincoln. He rushed to the Petersen House across from Ford's Theatre, where Lincoln lay dying. Meigs stood at the front door of the house for the rest of the deathwatch. He alone decided who was admitted to the house. When Lincoln died at 7:22 am on April 15, Meigs moved into the parlor to sit with the president's body. During Lincoln's funeral procession in the city five days later, Meigs rode at the head of two battalions of quartermaster corps soldiers.Schama, p. 105. ==Role in developing Arlington National Cemetery== The Civil War Unknowns Monument circa 1866, designed by Montgomery Meigs. Meigs played a critical role in developing Arlington National Cemetery, both during the Civil War and afterward. Although most burials initially occurred near the freedmen's cemetery in the estate's northeast corner, in mid-June 1864 Meigs ordered that burials commence immediately on the grounds of Arlington House. Brigadier General René Edward De Russy was living in Arlington House at the time and opposed the burial of bodies close to his quarters, forcing new interments to occur far to the west (in what is now Section 1 of the cemetery). But Meigs still demanded that officers be buried on the grounds of the mansion, around the Lee's former flower garden. The first officer burial had occurred there on May 17, but with Meigs' order another 44 officers were buried along the southern and eastern sides within a month. By May 31, more than 2,600 burials had occurred in the cemetery, and Meigs ordered that a white picket fence be constructed around the burial grounds. In December 1865, Robert E. Lee's brother, Smith Lee, visited Arlington House and observed that the house could be made livable again if the graves around the flower garden were removed.Cultural Landscape Program, p. 87. Accessed 2012-05-03. Meigs hated Lee for betraying the Union,Peters, p. 142. and ordered that more burials occur near the house to make it politically impossible for disinterment to occur.Poole, Robert M. \\"How Arlington National Cemetery Came to Be.\\" Smithsonian Magazine. November 2009. Accessed 2012-04-29. Meigs himself designed and implemented most of the changes at the cemetery in the 15 years after the war.Cultural Landscape Program, p. 103. Accessed 2012-05-03. In 1865, for example, Meigs decided to build a monument to Civil War dead in the center of a grove of trees west of the Lee's flower garden.Cultural Landscape Program, p. 96. Accessed 2012-04-29. U.S. Army troops were dispatched to investigate every battlefield within a radius of the city of Washington, D.C. The bodies of 2,111 Union and Confederate dead were collected, most of them from the battlefields of First and Second Bull Run, as well as the Union army's retreat along the Rappahannock River (which occurred after both battles). Although Meigs had not intended to collect the remains of Confederate war dead, the inability to identify remains meant that both Union and Confederate dead were interred below the cenotaph.Heidler, Heidler, and Coles, p. 78. U.S. Army engineers chopped down most the trees and dug a circular pit about wide and deep into the earth.Poole, p. 86. The walls and floor were lined with brick, and it was segmented it into compartments with mortared brick walls. Into each compartment were placed a different body part: skulls, legs, arms, ribs, etc.Bigler, p. 30. The vault was half full by the time it was ready for sealing in September 1866. Meigs designedPoole, p. 87. a tall, long, wide grey granite and concrete cenotaph to rest on top of the burial vault. The Civil War Unknowns Monument consists of two long, light grey granite slabs, with the shorter ends formed by sandwiching a smaller slab between the longer two. On the west face was an inscription describing the number of dead in the vault below, and honoring the \\"unknowns of the Civil War\\". Originally, a Rodman gun was placed on each corner, and a pyramid of shot adorned the center of the lid. A circular walk, centered from the center of the memorial, provided access. A walk led east to the flower garden, and another west to the road. Sod was laid around the memorial, and planting beds filled with annual plants emplaced. South column on the east side of the McClellan Gate, where Meigs had his own name inscribed. Meigs made additional major changes to the cemetery in the 1870s. In 1870, he ordered that a \\"Sylvan Hall\\"—a series of three cruciform tree plantings, one inside the other—be planted in the \\"Field of the Dead\\" (in what is now Section 13).Cultural Landscape Program, p. 103. Accessed 2012-05-03 A year later, Meigs ordered the McClellan Gate constructed. Located just west of the intersection of what is today McClellan and Eisenhower Drives, this was originally Arlington National Cemetery's main gate. Built of red sandstone and red brick, the name \\"MCCLELLAN\\" tops the simple rectangular gate in gilt letters. But just below the name was inscribed the name \\"MEIGS\\"—a tribute to himself which Meigs could not help making.Poole, p. 89.Hughes and Ware, p. 65. Due to the growing importance of the cemetery as well as the much larger crowds attending Memorial Day observances, Meigs also decided a formal meeting space at the cemetery was needed.Cultural Landscape Program, p. 107-108. Accessed 2012-05-03 A grove of trees southwest of Arlington House was cut down, and an amphitheater (today known as the Tanner Amphitheater) was constructed in 1874.Cultural Landscape Program, p. 108. Accessed 2012-05-03. Meigs himself designed the amphitheater. Meigs continued to work to ensure that the Lee family could never take control of Arlington. In 1882, the Supreme Court of the United States ruled in United States v. Lee that the seizure of the Arlington estate at a tax sale by the United States was illegal, and returned the estate to George Washington Custis Lee, General Lee's oldest son.Poole, 2009, p. 55. He, in turn, sold the estate back to the U.S. government for $150,000 in 1883.Atkinson, 2007, p. 26; Holt, 2010, p. 336. To commemorate the retention of the estate, in 1884 Meigs ordered that a Temple of Fame be erected in the Lee flower garden.Poole, p. 167. The U.S. Patent Office building had suffered a massive fire in 1877. It was torn down and rebuilt in 1879, but the work went very slowly. Meigs ordered that stone columns, pediments, and entablatures which had been saved from the Patent Office be used to construct the Temple of Fame. The Temple was a round, Greek Revival, temple-like structure with Doric columns supporting a central dome. Inscribed on the pediment supporting the dome were the names of great Americans such as George Washington, Ulysses S. Grant, Abraham Lincoln, and David Farragut. A year after it was built, the names of Union Civil War generals were carved into its columns.Cultural Landscape Program, p. 122. Accessed 2012-05-03. Since not enough marble was available to rebuild the dome, a tin dome (molded and painted to look like marble) was installed, instead. The Temple of Fame was demolished in 1967.Cultural Landscape Program, p. 164. ==Postbellum career and death== Looking southeast at the west (front) of Meigs' home (1958). Meigs became a permanent resident of the District of Columbia after the war. He purchased a home located at 1239 Vermont Avenue NW (at the corner of Vermont Avenue and N Street). As Quartermaster General after the Civil War, Meigs supervised plans for the new War Department building (constructed between 1866 and 1867), the National Museum (constructed in 1876), the extension of the Washington Aqueduct (constructed in 1876), and for a hall of records (constructed in 1878). Along with fellow Quartermaster Brigadier General Roeliff Brinkerhoff, Meigs edited a volume entitled, The Volunteer Quartermaster, a treatise which was considered the standard guide for the officers and employees of the quartermaster's department up until the World War I.General Roeliff Brinkerhoff. Ohio History: The Scholarly Journal of the Ohio Historical Society. Volume 20. From 1866 to 1868, to recuperate from the strain of his war service, Meigs visited Europe. From 1875 to 1876, he made another visit to study the organization of European armies, this time with nephew and Army officer Montgomery M. Macomb assigned as aide-de-camp. After his retirement on February 6, 1882, he became architect of the Pension Office Building, now home to the National Building Museum. He was a regent of the Smithsonian Institution, a member of the American Philosophical Society, and one of the earliest members of the National Academy of Sciences. ===Pension Building (1882 to 1887)=== Following the end of the Civil War, the US Congress passed legislation that greatly extended the scope of pension coverage for both veterans and their survivors and dependents, notably their widows and orphans. This greatly increased the number of staff needed to administer the new benefits system. More than 1,500 clerks were required, and a new building was needed to house them. Meigs was chosen to design and construct the new building, now the National Building Museum. He broke away from the established Greco-Roman models that had been the basis of government buildings in Washington, D.C., until then, and was to continue following the completion of the Pension Building. Meigs based his design on Italian Renaissance precedents, notably Rome's Palazzo Farnese and Palazzo della Cancelleria. The white tomb of Montgomery C. Meigs: To the left is the sarcophagus Meigs designed for his son, John (shown in bas relief). To the right is a marker above the graves of his father and grandfather, who were reinterred next to him. Included in his design was a long sculptured frieze executed by Caspar Buberl. Since creating a work of sculpture of that size was well out of Meigs's budget, he had Buberl create 28 different scenes (totaling in length), which were then mixed and slightly modified to create the continuous long parade that includes over 1,300 figures. Because of the way the 28 sections are modified and mixed up, only somewhat careful examination reveals the frieze to be the same figures repeated over and over. The sculpture includes infantry, navy, artillery, cavalry, and medical components, as well as a good deal of the supply and quartermaster functions. Meigs's correspondence with Buberl reveals that Meigs insisted that one teamster, \\"must be a negro, a plantation slave, freed by war,\\" be included in the quartermaster panel.McDaniel, Collected Works. This figure was ultimately to assume a position in the center, over the west entrance to the building. When Philip Sheridan was asked to comment on the building, his reply echoed the sentiment of many of the Washington establishment of the day, that the only thing that he could find wrong with the building was that it was fireproof. (A similar quote is also attributed to William T. Sherman, so the story might well be apocryphal.) The completed building, sometimes referred to as \\"Meigs's Old Red Barn\\", was created by using more than 15,000,000 bricks,Building Museum Website retrieved 27 June 2010 which, according to the wits of the day, were all counted by the parsimonious Meigs. ===Death=== Meigs contracted a cold on December 27, 1891. Within a few days, it turned into pneumonia. Meigs died at home at 5:00 pm on January 2, 1892.\\"Death of Gen. Meigs.\\" Washington Post. January 3, 1892. His body was interred with high military honors in Arlington National Cemetery. General orders issued at the time of his death declared, \\"the Army has rarely possessed an officer ... who was entrusted by the government with a great variety of weighty responsibilities, or who proved himself more worthy of confidence.\\"Fawell, p. 458. ==Family== In 1841, Meigs married Louisa Rodgers (1816–1879), the daughter of Commodore John Rodgers.

It was formed in the 1970s by centrist Christian Democrats who had left the Social Christian Party and the left wing of the Conservative Party who were oriented towards Liberation theology. It officially registered as a political party in 1979. It was originally considered a centre-left party. Later in the 1990s, it shifted to the centre-right. It reached its first great success in 1978 when party member Osvaldo Hurtado became the running mate on the successful presidential ticket of Jaime Roldós of the Concentration of People's Forces. Hurtado served as President of Ecuador from 1981 to 1984 due to Roldós's death in office. It was Ecuador's largest political party, having won 35% of the seats in the 1998 elections to the Congreso Nacional. In the 1998 presidential elections, party member Jamil Mahuad was elected president, and after a coup d'état and brief military rule, he was succeeded in 2000 by the vice-president, Gustavo Noboa, who was also in the party. At the legislative elections, 20 October 2002, the party won 4 out of 100 seats. In 2006, it dropped the name of Popular Democracy and took the current one. At the elections, held in October 2006, it won 2 seats in the Congress. It had no presidential candidate. The UDC was a member of the Christian Democrat Organization of America, continental organization of the Centrist Democrat International. In 2013, the UDC was dissolved after the National Congress of the party. ==References== Category:1977 establishments in Ecuador Category:2013 disestablishments in Ecuador Category:Christian democratic parties in South America Category:Christianity in Ecuador Category:Conservative parties in Ecuador Category:Defunct political parties in Ecuador Category:Political parties disestablished in 2013 Category:Political parties established in 1977 ","title":"Christian Democratic Union (Ecuador)"},{"id":"1282878","text":"Francis II Rákóczi (, ; 27 March 1676 – 8 April 1735) was a Hungarian nobleman\\"Hungary,\\" Microsoft Encarta Online Encyclopedia 2008. Archived 2009-10-31. and leader of the Hungarian uprising against the Habsburgs in 1703-11 as the prince () of the Estates Confederated for Liberty of the Kingdom of Hungary. He was also Prince of Transylvania, an Imperial Prince, and a member of the Order of the Golden Fleece. Today he is considered a national hero in Hungary. His full title was: Franciscus II. Dei Gratia Sacri Romani Imperii & Transylvaniae princeps Rakoczi. Particum Regni Hungariae Dominus & Siculorum Comes, Regni Hungariae Pro Libertate Confoederatorum Statuum necnon Munkacsiensis & Makoviczensis Dux, Perpetuus Comes de Saros; Dominus in Patak, Tokaj, Regécz, Ecsed, Somlyó, Lednicze, Szerencs, Onod. His name is historically also spelled Rákóczy, in Hungarian: II. Rákóczi Ferenc, in Slovak: František II. Rákoci, in German: Franz II. Rákóczi, in Croatian: Franjo II. Rákóczy (Rakoci, Rakoczy), in Romanian: Francisc Rákóczi al II-lea, in Serbian Ференц II Ракоци. ==Childhood== He was the richest landlord in the Kingdom of Hungary and was the count (comes perpetuus) of the Comitatus Sarossiensis (in Hungarian Sáros) from 1694 on. He was the third of three children born to Francis I Rákóczi, elected ruling prince of Transylvania, and Ilona Zrínyi, who was the daughter of Petar Zrinski, Ban of Croatia, and niece of Petar's older brother, Miklós Zrínyi. His paternal grandfather George Rákóczi II and great-grandfather George I Rákóczi were also Princes of Transylvania. He had a brother, George, who died as a baby before Francis was born, and a sister, Julianna Rákóczi, later Countess of Aspremont-Lynden, who was four years older than Francis. His father died when he was four months old. Upon Ferenc I's death, his widow requested guardianship of her children; however, the advisors of Emperor Leopold I insisted that he retain guardianship of both Ferenc and his sister, especially as Francis I had willed this before death. Despite further difficulties, Zrínyi was able to raise her children, while the Emperor retained legal guardianship. The family lived in the castle of Munkács (today Mukacheve, in Ukraine), Sárospatak and Regéc until 1680, when Ferenc's paternal grandmother, Sofia Báthory, died. Then, they moved permanently into the castle of Munkács. Rákóczi retained strong affection for this place throughout his life. Aside from his mother, Rákóczi's key educators were György Kőrössy, castellan to the family, and János Badinyi. ==End of the Thököly uprising== The memorial plate of Francis II embedded in the northern wall of the St. Elisabeth Cathedral in Košice, Slovakia Zrínyi's second husband, Imre Thököly took little interest in Rákóczi's education, as he was by then heavily involved in politics. However, the failure of the Turks to capture the Habsburg capital in the Battle of Vienna in 1683 frustrated Thököly's plans to become King of Upper Hungary. When the Turks began to grow suspicious of his intentions, Thököly proposed sending the young Rákóczi to Constantinople as a guarantee of his goodwill. But Rákóczi's mother opposed this plan, not wishing to be separated from her son. In 1686 Antonio Caraffa besieged their residence, the castle of Munkács. Zrínyi successfully led the defence of the castle for three years, but capitulated in 1688. The two Rákóczi children fell again under the guardianship of Leopold I, and moved to Vienna with their mother. They regained their possessions, but could not leave the city without the Emperor's permission. At the age of 17, the Emperor emancipated Rákóczi from his mother, thereby allowing him to own property. His sister Julianna had interceded for him after marrying a powerful Austrian, General Aspremont. Rákóczi lived with the Aspremonts until his marriage in September 1694, to 15-year-old Princess Amelia, a daughter of Charles, Landgrave of Hesse-Wanfried and a descendant of Saint Elizabeth of Hungary. The couple moved to the Rákóczi castle at Sárospatak, where Rákóczi began to manage his properties. The Treaty of Karlowitz on 26 January 1699, forced Thököly and Zrínyi into exile. Rákóczi remained in Vienna under the Emperor's supervision. Relying on the prevalent anti-Habsburg sentiment, remnants of Thököly's peasant army started a new uprising in the Hegyalja region of Northeastern present-day Hungary, which was part of the property of the Rákóczi family. They captured the castles of Tokaj, Sárospatak and Sátoraljaújhely, and asked Rákóczi to become their leader, but he was not eager to head what appeared to be a minor peasant rebellion. He quickly returned to Vienna, where he tried his best to clear his name. Rákóczi then befriended Count Miklós Bercsényi, whose property at Ungvár (today Ужгород (Uzhhorod), in Ukraine), lay next to his own. Bercsényi was a highly educated man, the third richest man in the kingdom (after Rákóczi and Simon Forgách), and was related to most of the Hungarian aristocracy. ==Rákóczi uprising== As the House of Habsburg was on the verge of dying out in Spain, France was looking for allies in its fight against Austrian hegemony. Consequently, they established contact with Rákóczi and promised support if he took up the cause of Hungarian independence. An Austrian spy seized this correspondence and brought it to the attention of the Emperor. As a direct result of this, Rákóczi was arrested on 18 April 1700, and imprisoned in the fortress of Wiener Neustadt (south of Vienna). It became obvious during the preliminary hearings that, just as in the case of his grandfather Péter Zrínyi, the only possible sentence for Ferenc was death. With the aid of his pregnant wife Amelia and the prison commander, Rákóczi managed to escape and flee to Poland. Here he met with Bercsényi again, and together they resumed contact with the French court. Three years later, the War of the Spanish Succession caused a large part of the Austrian forces in the Kingdom of Hungary to temporarily leave the country. Taking advantage of the situation, Kuruc forces began a new uprising in Munkács, and Rákóczi was asked to head it. He decided to invest his energies in a war of national liberation, and accepted the request. On 15 June 1703, another group of about 3000 armed men headed by Tamás Esze joined him near the Polish city of Ławoczne. Bercsényi arrived too, with French funds and 600 Polish mercenaries. Gyula Benczúr (1844–1920): Capture of Francis II. Rákóczi in Nagysáros Castle (1869) Most of the Hungarian nobility did not support Rákóczi's uprising, because they considered it to be no more than a peasant rebellion. Rákóczi's famous call to the nobility of Szabolcs County seemed to be in vain. He did manage to convince the Hajduk (Hungarian soldiers) (emancipated peasant warriors) to join his forces, so his forces controlled most of Kingdom of Hungary to the east and north of the Danube by late September 1703. He continued by conquering Transdanubia soon after. Since the Austrians had to fight Rákóczi on several fronts, they felt obliged to enter negotiations with him. However, the victory of Austrian and British forces against a combined French-Bavarian army in the Battle of Blenheim on 13 August 1704, provided an advantage not only in the War of the Spanish Succession, but also prevented the union of Rákóczi's forces with their French-Bavarian allies. Statue of Francis II situated outside Hungarian Parliament Building This placed Rákóczi into a difficult military and financial situation. French support gradually diminished, and a larger army was needed to occupy the already-won land. Meanwhile, supplying the current army with arms and food was beyond his means. He tried to solve this problem by creating a new copper-based coinage, which was not easily accepted in Hungary as people were used to silver coins. Nevertheless, Rákóczi managed to maintain his military advantage for a while – but after 1706, his army was forced into retreat. A meeting of the Hungarian Diet (consisting of 6 bishops, 36 aristocrats and about 1000 representatives of the lower nobility of 25 counties), held near Szécsény (Nógrád County) in September 1705, elected Rákóczi to be the \\"vezérlő fejedelem\\" – (ruling) prince – of the Confederated Estates of the Kingdom of Hungary, to be assisted by a 24-member Senate. Rákóczi and the Senate were assigned joint responsibility for the conduct of foreign affairs, including peace talks. Encouraged by England and the Netherlands, peace talks started again on 27 October 1705 between the Hungarians and the Emperor. Both sides varied their strategy according to the military situation. One stumbling block was the sovereignty over Transylvania – neither side was prepared to give it up. Rákóczi's proposed treaty with the French was stalled, so he became convinced that only a declaration of independence would make it acceptable for various powers to negotiate with him. In 1706, his wife (whom he had not seen in 5 years, along with their sons József and György) and his sister were both sent as peace ambassadors, but Rákóczi rejected their efforts on behalf of the Emperor. In 1707 during the Great Northern War he was one of the candidates to the throne of Poland, supported by Elżbieta Sieniawska. On Rákóczi's recommendation, and with Bercsényi's support, another meeting of the Diet held at Ónod (Borsod county) declared the deposition of the House of Habsburg from the Hungarian throne on 13 June 1707. But neither this act, nor the copper currency issued to avoid monetary inflation, were successful. Louis XIV refused to enter into treaties with Prince Rákóczi, leaving the Hungarians without allies. There remained the possibility of an alliance with Imperial Russia, but this did not materialize either. At the Battle of Trencsén (German: Trentschin, Latin: Trentsinium, Comitatus Trentsiniensis, today Trenčín in Slovakia), on 3 August 1708 Rákóczi's horse stumbled, and he fell to the ground, which knocked him unconscious. The Kuruc forces thought him dead and fled. This defeat was fatal for the uprising. Numerous Kuruc leaders transferred their allegiance to the Emperor, hoping for clemency. Rákóczi's forces became restricted to the area around Munkács and Szabolcs County. Not trusting the word of János Pálffy, who was the Emperor's envoy charged with negotiations with the rebels, the Prince left the Kingdom of Hungary for Poland on 21 February 1711. ==Peace agreement== In Rákóczi's absence, Sándor Károlyi was named Commander-in-Chief of the Hungarian forces, and quickly negotiated a peace agreement with János Pálffy. Under its provisions, 12,000 rebels laid down their arms, handed over their flags and took an oath of allegiance to the Emperor on 1 May 1711 in the fields outside Majtény, in Szatmár county. The Peace of Szatmár did not treat Rákóczi particularly badly. He was assured clemency if he took an oath of allegiance to the Emperor, as well as the freedom to move to Poland if he wanted to leave the Kingdom of Hungary. He did not accept these conditions, doubting the honesty of the Habsburg court, and he did not even recognize the legality of the Peace Treaty, as it had been signed after the death of the Emperor Joseph I on 17 April 1711, which terminated the plenipotential authority of János Pálffy. Subsequently, his Hungarian properties, Munkács and its castle, Szentmiklós (today Palanok Castle, Mukacheve and Chynadiyovo, Ukraine) and 200 villages were confiscated (and, in 1726, given by Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor to Elector-Archbishop Lothar Franz von Schönborn who had helped to defeat Rákóczi). ==Exile== Rákóczi was offered the Polish Crown twice, supported by Tsar Peter I of Russia. He turned the offers down, though, and remained in Poland until 1712, where he was the honored guest of the Polish aristocracy. For a while he lived in Gdańsk under the pseudonym of Count of Sáros. He left Gdańsk on 16 November 1712, and went to England, where Queen Anne, pressured by the Habsburgs, refused to receive him. Rákóczi then crossed the Channel to France, landing in Dieppe on 13 January 1713. On 27 April he handed a memorandum to Louis XIV reminding him of his past services to France and asking him not to forget Hungary during the coming peace negotiations for the War of the Spanish Succession. But neither the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713 nor the Treaty of Rastatt in 1714 made any mention of Hungary or Rákóczi. No provisions were even made to allow Rákóczi's two sons, who were kept under surveillance in Vienna, to rejoin their father. Prince Rákóczi, although not recognized officially by France, was much in favour in the French court. But after the death of Louis XIV on 1 September 1715, he decided to accept the invitation of the Ottoman Empire (still at war with the Habsburgs) to move there. He left France in September 1717, with an entourage of 40 people. and landed at Gallipoli on 10 October 1717. He was received with honors, but his desire to head up a separate Christian army to help in the fight against the Habsburgs was not under serious consideration. The memorial house of Francis II in Tekirdağ The Ottoman Empire signed the Peace Treaty of Passarowitz with Austria on 21 July 1718. Among its provisions was the refusal of the Turks to extradite the exiled Hungarians. Two years later, the Austrian envoy requested that the exiles be turned over, but the Sultan refused as a matter of honor. Rákóczi and his entourage were settled in the town of Tekirdağ (Rodostó in Hungarian), relatively distant from the Ottoman capital, and a large Hungarian colony grew up around this town on the Sea of Marmara. Bercsényi, Count Simon Forgách, Count Antal Esterházy, Count Mihály Csáky, Miklós Sibrik, Zsigmond Zay, the two Pápays, and Colonel Ádám Jávorka were among many who settled there, sharing the sentiment of the writer Kelemen Mikes, who said, “I had no special reason to leave my country, except that I greatly loved the Prince.” The memorial house of Francis II in Košice (a replica of his original house of Tekirdağ) Rákóczi lived in the Turkish town of Tekirdağ for 18 years. He adopted a set routine: rising early, attending daily Mass, writing and reading in the mornings, and carpentry in the afternoons; visited occasionally by his son, György Rákóczi. Further military troubles in 1733 in Poland awakened his hopes of a possible return to Hungary, but they were not fulfilled. Rákóczi was 59 years old when he died on 8 April 1735. Rákóczi's testament ( will ), dated 27 October 1733, left something to all his family members as well as to his fellow exiles. He left separate letters to be sent to the Sultan and to France’s Ambassador to Constantinople, asking them not to forget about his fellow exiles. His internal organs were buried in the Greek church of Rodosto, while his heart was sent to France. After obtaining the permission of the Turkish authorities, Rákóczi's body was taken by his faithful chamberlain Kelemen Mikes to Constantinople on 6 July 1735 for burial in Saint-Benoît (then Jesuit) French church in Galata, where he was buried, according to his last wishes, next to his mother Ilona Zrínyi. His remains were moved on 29 October 1906 to the St. Elisabeth Cathedral in Kassa, Hungary (today Košice, Slovakia), where he is buried with his mother Ilona and his son.Katalin Mária Kincses „Without Special Ceremony: The Cult of Rákóczi - Bringing Home the Prince's Mortal Remains” ==Timeline== Histoire des Révolutions de Hongrie, The Hague, by Jean Neaulme, 1739 *Early life ** 27 March 1676 – Rákóczi is born. ** 26 January 1699 – Treaty of Karlowitz forces Emmeric Thököly and Ilona Zrínyi into exile. ** 11 February 1701 – Negotiations begin with Louis XIV concerning the Hungarian struggle for independence. ** February, 1701 – Correspondence is seized by an Austrian spy.

In the 1950s, the first two words, Cum Deo (i.e., \\"With God\\"), were removed for ideological reasons; in 1989, they were restored. When, after 1945, the great Millennium Monument on Heroes' Square was purged of statues of the Habsburg kings of Hungary, the best Hungarian sculptor of the period, Zsigmond Kisfaludi Strobl, made a new statue of Rákóczi instead of King Lipót II. It was erected in 1953 together with a relief on the base depicting the meeting of Rákóczy and Tamás Esze. ===Places and institutions=== Nearly every Hungarian city has commemorated Rákóczi by naming streets and squares after him. There are 11 Rákóczi streets and 3 Rákóczi squares in Budapest alone (see: Public place names of Budapest), including one of the most prominent avenues, named (\\"Rákóczi Avenue\\"), forming the boundary between Districts VII and VIII.Budapest City Atlas, Szarvas- Dimap, Budapest, 2011, The street was named after him on 28 October 1906 when his remains were brought back to Hungary from Turkey and a long funeral march went along the street to the Eastern Railway Station. , in District VIII, was also named after him in 1874. A bridge on the Danube at Budapest is named Rákóczi Bridge after him. In Hungary two villages bear the name of Rákóczi. Rákóczifalva in Jász-Nagykun-Szolnok County was established in 1883 on the former estate of Rákóczi where the Prince had a hunting lodge. The neighbouring Rákócziújfalu became an independent village in 1950 (before that it was part of Rákóczifalva). The village of Zavadka, today in Ukraine next to the Veretski Pass (Hungarian: Vereckei-hágó) where Rákóczi arrived at Hungary in the beginning of the uprising in 1703 and where he said goodbye to his followers in 1711 going into exile was renamed Rákócziszállás in 1889. The neighbouring village of Podpolóc (today Pidpolozzya) where Rákóczi spent a night in 1703 was renamed that year Vezérszállás. After 1918 the two villages got back their former names. The Mount Bovcar (today Vovcharskiy Vrh in present-day Ukraine and the neighbouring Bovcar Spring was named by the local Rusyn people after Rákóczi who drank from the spring on 18 February 1711. means \\"the Tsar was here\\" in Rusyn language. The library of Borsod-Abaúj- Zemplén county in Miskolc (II. Rákóczi Ferenc Megyei Könyvtár) has also been named after him. The house in which he lived has been transformed into Rákóczi Museum, Tekirdağ, open to the visitors every day except Mondays. ===Banknotes=== Rákóczi's portrait can be found on Hungarian banknotes. Before it had been withdrawn from circulation, it was on the 50-forint note. Since then it has been transferred to the 500-forint note. ===Rákóczi March=== A well-known patriotic tune of the 18–19th century (composer unknown), is also named after Rákóczi, as it was reputed to be his favourite, although actually it was composed only in the 1730s. Hector Berlioz orchestrated the piece, and it was also used by Franz Liszt as the basis of his Hungarian Rhapsody No.15. The Rákóczy March remains a popular piece of Hungarian state and military celebrations. ==Postage stamps== * Francis II Rákóczi was honored by Hungary by issuing a set of five stamps in his honor on 8 April 1935.colnect.com/en/stamps/list/country/6955-Hungary/year/1935 * Another stamp was issued in his honor on 1 January 1943 in the “Characters and Relics of Hungarian History” series.colnect.com/en/stamps/stamp/179986-Ferenc_II_Rákóczi_1676-1735-Characters_and_Relics_of_Hungarian_History- Hungary * A series of seven commemorative stamps of paintings was issued on 27 March 1976 on account of 300th birth anniversary of Rákóczi.colnect.com/en/stamps/list/country/6955-Hungary/year/1976/page/2 ==See also== * Executioner's Bastion * Rákóczi's sculpture in Košice * Count of St. Germain theorized as son ==References== ==External links== * His life * A detailed timeline of his rebellion * His picture on the Hungarian 500 forint banknote Category:1676 births Category:1735 deaths Category:Monarchs of Transylvania Category:People from Trebišov District Francis 02 Category:Knights of the Golden Fleece of Spain Category:17th-century Hungarian people Category:18th-century Hungarian people Category:Rebellious princes ","title":"Francis II Rákóczi"},{"id":"1282880","text":"Thrillington is an album produced by English musician Paul McCartney, under the pseudonym of Percy \\"Thrills\\" Thrillington, released in April 1977 in the UK and in May 1977 in the US. It is an instrumental cover version of Paul and Linda McCartney's 1971 album Ram. Originally recorded in June 1971, the album was shelved upon the formation of Wings. Although McCartney initially kept his involvement a secret, he soon revealed himself to be Thrillington in 1989. The album was re-issued as part of the deluxe edition of Ram in 2012. ==History== The album was recorded in June 1971 – with McCartney as producer – and with an intended release shortly thereafter. Arranger Richard Anthony Hewson was asked to work on the orchestration before Ram had yet been released. When Paul and Linda decided to form Wings, the album was shelved. In preparation for the release of Thrillington, McCartney invented the fictitious socialite Percy Thrillington, and even took out ads in various UK music papers announcing Thrillington's so-called comings and goings to generate curiosity and interest. Released in April 1977, McCartney's name was mentioned only in the main liner notes where he is described as a friend of Percy. Thrillington went mostly unnoticed upon its release although it was reviewed by Rolling Stone magazine and mentioned in the \\"Random Notes\\" section.\\"Random Notes\\" Rolling Stone 2 June 1977: 37 It was widely assumed that this was McCartney working under a pseudonym and the album became a collector's item. McCartney finally admitted his role to journalist Peter Palmiere at a Los Angeles press conference on 27 November 1989 during his world tour: \\"What a great question to end the conference. The world needs to know! But seriously it was me and Linda – and we kept it a secret for a long time but now the world knows! – you blew it!\\" In 1990 Paul McCartney also admitted to Palmiere, via an autograph request, that he was indeed Clint Harrigan – the liner notes writer for Thrillington and Paul McCartney and Wings' Wild Life album. The first person to reveal the identity of Clint Harrigan was John Lennon, who stated as much during a well-publicised letter feud with McCartney in the New Musical Express in 1972. The full story of the Thrillington album was told in detail in 1995 in Beatles fanzine Good Day Sunshine \\"Thrillington\\", by Matt Hurwitz, Good Day Sunshine Magazine, 1995 and in music journalist Ian Peel's book The Unknown Paul McCartney (Reynolds & Hearn, 2002). Peel tracked down various musicians who brought McCartney's vision to life – including Richard Hewson, Herbie Flowers and the Mike Sammes Singers – as well as those that were involved in creating its mythology. ==Re-release== Thrillington was issued on CD in 1995 and 2018, the latter with an accompanying vinyl version. Thrillington was re- issued as part of the deluxe edition of Ram on 21 May 2012.

Confederate forces under Lt. Gen. Jubal A. Early defeated Union forces under Maj. Gen. Lew Wallace. The battle was part of Early's raid through the Shenandoah Valley and into Maryland in an attempt to divert Union forces away from Gen. Robert E. Lee's army under siege at Petersburg, Virginia. The battle was the northernmost Confederate victory of the war. While the Union troops retreated to Baltimore, Maryland, the Confederates continued toward Washington, D.C., but the battle at Monocacy delayed Early's march for a day, allowing time for Union reinforcements to arrive in the Union capital. The Confederates launched an attack on Washington on July 12 at the Battle of Fort Stevens, but were unsuccessful and retreated to Virginia. ==Background== In May and June, as part of the Valley Campaigns of 1864, Union General-in-Chief Lt. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant planned a coordinated movement of troops against Confederates in Virginia. It was during this campaign that Lt. Gen. Jubal Early's Confederates defeated Union forces to open a path to Washington, D.C.Boomhower, p. 12.Stephens, p. 181. After skirmishing with Maj. Gen. David Hunter's men outside of Lynchburg, Virginia, on June 17 and 18, Early increased his forces to nearly 16,000 men and continued to Martinsburg, West Virginia, where the outnumbered Union troops had evacuated the town. On June 19, a small Union force at Harpers Ferry, West Virginia, burned the bridge across the Potomac River.Stephens, p. 182-84. Grant reacted to Early's raids at Martinsburg and Harpers Ferry by dispatching two brigades, about 5,000 men, from the 3rd Division of the VI Corps, under Brig. Gen. James B. Ricketts, from City Point, Virginia, to Harpers Ferry on July 5, 1864.Boomhower, p. 4. Until Union troops arrived to defend Washington, the only Federal force between Early and the Union capital was a 2,300-man force (mostly Hundred Days Men) under the command of Maj. Gen. Lew Wallace. At the time, Wallace, who would become better known as the author of Ben-Hur, was in command of the Union's Middle Department and VIII Corps, based in Baltimore. Few of Wallace's men had ever seen battle,Leepson, August 2007, p. 24. and although Wallace had experience as a battlefield commander, having been the Union Army's youngest major general at the time of his promotion, his military career faltered after he was blamed for the high casualties taken on the first day at the Battle of Shiloh.Leepson, 2007, p. 79. In the meantime, agents of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad at Cumberland, Maryland, and Harpers Ferry reported signs of Early's advance on June 29. John W. Garrett, the president of the railroad and a Union supporter, passed this intelligence and subsequent reports were passed to Wallace on July 3.Cooling (1996), p. 20 and 42. Garrett was concerned about protecting a railroad bridge at Monocacy Junction, Maryland, where it crossed the Monocacy River. The bridge was important to rail connections at Harpers Ferry and points farther west, so Wallace agreed to bring a force to the Monocacy to protect it.Stephens, p. 184-86. ==Preparing for battle== On July 3, acting on his own without orders from his superiors or informing them of his intentions, Wallace dispatched Brig. Gen. Erastus B. Tyler and men from the 1st Maryland Infantry and 3rd Maryland Infantry, Potomac Home Brigade, to Monocacy Junction to establish defensive positions. After Garrett's agents reported the Confederate attack at Harpers Ferry, Wallace relayed the information to Gen. Henry Halleck, then ordered his brigades at Baltimore to be ready to move. Wallace departed for Monocacy Junction on July 4 to assess its defenses. Uncertain whether Baltimore or Washington was the Confederate objective, Wallace knew he had to delay their approach until reinforcements could reach either city. Wallace saw Monocacy Junction, also called Frederick Junction, southeast of Frederick, as the most logical point to defend Baltimore and Washington. A plain extended north and west from the river at Monocacy Junction to the Catoctin Mountains, away. From Monocacy Junction, the B&O; Railroad's bridge crossed the river at the foot of a bluff. A wooden bridge provided the Georgetown Pike access to Washington across the Monocacy River, a short distance downriver, while a stone bridge took Baltimore Pike across the Monocacy upriver. Two blockhouses, one near the junction and another on the bluff above the railroad bridge, provided additional protection. A 24-pound howitzer was installed at the blockhouse on the bluff.Stephens, p. 186. If Wallace could stretch his force across of the stream to protect both turnpike bridges, the railroad bridge, and several river fords, he could force Early to disclose the strength and objective of the Confederate force and delay him as long as possible.Cooling (1989), pp. 56–57.Stephens, p. 188. Initially, Wallace's forces along the river at Monocacy Junction consisted of Tyler's brigades and a cavalry force of 230 troopers from the 8th Illinois Cavalry Regiment commanded by Lt. Col. David R. Clendenin. Wallace moved in additional troops to assist them, including the 11th Maryland, a field artillery unit, and Ohio units from Annapolis and Baltimore. Wallace's men skirmished with Early's cavalry west of Frederick on July 7, but later retreated toward Monocacy Junction to avoid being surrounded.Stephens, p. 188-89. Following the skirmishing on July 7 and 8, when Confederate cavalry drove Union units from Frederick, Early demanded, and received, $200,000 ransom to save it from destruction.Cooling (1989), p. 51. Wallace's prospects improved with word arrived that the first contingent of VI Corps troops, commanded by Ricketts, had reached Baltimore. Although they were originally ordered to travel by rail to Harpers Ferry, Ricketts and about 3,300 of his men arrived at Monocacy Junction, where Wallace stopped them on the evening of July 8. Ricketts agreed to remain at the Monocacy to assist Wallace.Cooling (1989), pp. 55, 62.Stephens, p. 192. When Wallace informed Halleck that the Confederates were threatening the road to Washington, Halleck wired Grant to send reinforcements to the capital. The Union troops at Monocacy Junction would have to delay Early's troops, who were within a two-days' march of Washington.Stephens, p. 189. On Saturday, July 9, the combined forces of Wallace and Ricketts, about 6,800 men, were positioned at the bridges and fords of the river. The higher elevation of the river's east bank formed a natural breastwork for some of the men, while Tyler's brigade occupied the two block-houses and trenches his soldiers had dug near the bridges. Ricketts's division occupied the Thomas and Worthington farms on the Union left, using the fences as breastworks.Cooling (1996), p. 108–9. Confederate troop estimates ranged from 14,000 to 28,000 men, nearly double the size of the Union forces.Boomhower, p. 4 and 12. ==Opposing forces== ===Union=== ===Confederate=== ==Battle== thumbrightupright=1.5Battle of Monocacy Wallace’s objectives for the battle were simple: keep the road to Washington secure as long as possible and maintain a line of retreat for his men. On July 9, between 9 and 10 a.m., Confederate Maj. Gen. Stephen Dodson Ramseur's division encountered about 3,500 of Rickett's men along the bluffs overlooking the bridge, where the Georgetown Pike crossed the river, while Maj. Gen. Robert E. Rodes's division clashed with Tyler's brigade, who was guarding the Baltimore Pike and its stone bridge across the river. Clendenin's Union cavalry was downstream, watching the river.Stephens, p. 191-92. Prisoners taken during this phase told the Confederates that the entire VI Corps was present, which seemed to have heightened the Confederates' caution and they did not initially press their numerical advantage.Cooling (1989), pp. 62–63. Believing that a frontal attack across the Monocacy would be too costly, Early sent Brig. Gen. John McCausland's cavalry of about 1,100 men down Buckeystown Road to find a ford and outflank the Union line. McCausland crossed the Monocacy below the McKinney-Worthington ford, about a mile downstream from the Georgetown Pike bridge, and attacked Wallace's left flank. Due to the rolling terrain, McCausland's men did not notice that four regiments of Ricketts's veteran troops had taken a position along a fence separating the Worthington and Thomas farms. Consequently, the Union line was able to fire a single volley that destroyed McCausland's front line and panicked the remaining Confederates.Cooling (1996), p. 118-19.Stephens, p. 194. McCausland rallied his brigade and launched another attack, but was unable to break the Union line and retreated.Leepson, 2007, p. 106-7.Stephens, p. 196. When the cavalry could not break the Union flank on its own, Early sent Maj. Gen. John B. Gordon's infantry division across the ford to assist in the attack. Gordon launched a three-pronged attack with three brigades against Ricketts's center and both flanks.Stephens, p. 198. Ricketts's right flank was pushed back, allowing the Confederates to enfilade the Union line. Pressure from Ramseur's attack on the Union center and Confederate artillery fire from across the river kept Wallace from reinforcing Ricketts's men. Unable to hold the Union line, Wallace ordered a retreat towards Baltimore, leaving Tyler's brigade holding the stone bridge with a small force of men. Clendenin's cavalry remained south on the Georgetown Pike as a rearguard.Stephens, p. 200.Cooling (1996), p. 151-59. Rodes's Confederate troops made one final push to capture the stone bridge about 6 p.m., but most of the Union troops were already headed toward Baltimore. At the end of the day, the outnumbered Union forces had withstood five attacks before they were forced to retreat. ==Aftermath== Map of Monocacy Battlefield core and study areas by the American Battlefield Protection Program By late afternoon on July 9, following the northernmost Confederate victory of the war, the Federals were retreating toward Baltimore, leaving behind more than 1,294 dead, wounded, or captured.Boomhower, p 12, states the Union casualties were higher, at 98 killed, 594 wounded, and 1,188 missing. Early's army had won the field at Monocacy, but at the cost of an estimated 700 to 1,000 men killed or woundedBoomhower, p. 12, states Early reported his casualties as 600 to 700 men. and the loss of a day's march. Wallace telegrammed Halleck that his forces fought until 5 p.m., but the Confederate forces, which he estimated at 20,000 men, had overwhelmed them and forced a retreat. One critical objective had been accomplished: the Union troops at Monocacy Junction had delayed Early’s advance on Washington by a full day. After hearing of the retreat, Grant, who was in charge of VIII Corps., put Maj. Gen. E. O. C. Ord in command of Wallace’s troops. (Wallace did not learn that he had been replaced until July 11, after his forces reached Baltimore; however, he still retained responsibility for the administration of the Middle Department.) When government officials became aware of the efforts that Wallace and his men had made to save Washington, the situation changed. Wallace was restored to full command of VIII Corps and the Middle Department on July 28.Stephens, p. 201, 203, and 205.Boomhower, p. 13.Cooling (1996), p. 179; Cooling (1989), p. 208. With Wallace's retreat to Baltimore, the road lay open to Washington. On July 10 the Confederates began the march toward the Union capital. By midday on Monday, July 11, Early arrived at Fort Stevens, where he could see the dome of the U.S. Capitol through his glasses. With his troops straggling behind him, exhausted from the heat and the long march, Early decided to delay the attack on the fort until July 12. Although artillery exchanges and skirmishes occurred on July 11, prior to the full-scale attack, Early was too late. VI Corps, the Union troops that Grant had dispatched to Washington, had already arrived and was prepared to defend the city. The Confederate infantry, reduced to 8,000 men, was unable to continue, and by July 14 Early had crossed the Potomac at White's Ferry into Virginia.Leepson, August 2007, pp. 24–25.Stephens, p. 204. Monocacy cost Early a day's march and his chance to capture Washington. Thwarted in the attempt to take the Union capital, the Confederates retreated into Virginia, ending their last campaign to carry the war into the North.Leepson, August 2007, p. 29 Union forces in the area pursued Early, but due to a divided military command, they were unable to defeat him. In response, Grant formed the Middle Military Division, covering Maryland, West Virginia, Pennsylvania, the District of Columbia, and the Shenandoah Valley, to coordinate the offense against Confederate forces in the valley.Cooling (1989), p. 225. General Early wrote in a report of the 1864 campaign: Grant assessed Wallace's delaying tactics at Monocacy in his memoirs: In late July, Wallace gave orders to collect the bodies of the dead and bury them on the battlefield. He also proposed a monument to be erected on the site with an inscription that would read: \\"These men died to save the National Capital, and they did save it.\\" (Wallace's proposed monument was never built, but five others were erected in honor of those who died in the battle.)Cooling (1996), p. 210. ==Battlefield preservation== The battlefield remained in private hands for more than one hundred years before portions of it were acquired in the late 1970s to create the Monocacy National Battlefield. The park was dedicated in July 1991. Five monuments were erected at the site, including tributes to Union troops from New Jersey, Vermont, and Pennsylvania, as well as the Confederate force who fought in the battle.Cooling (1996), p. 236-38 and 241.

She was born in Chipiona (Cádiz) and nicknamed \\"La más grande\\" (\\"The Greatest\\"). In 2000 in New York, she won the prize \\"La voz del Milenio\\" for best female voice of the 20th century. Rocío Jurado sold more than 16 million records, making her one of the best-selling Spanish female singers. She received 5 platinum and 30 gold discs. ==Childhood and youth== Rocío Jurado was born in Calvo Soto Street 11, Chipiona (Cádiz) in Andalusia, Spain. Her father, Fernando Mohedano Crespo (died at 36 years old) was a shoemaker and flamenco singer in his spare time; her mother, Rocío Jurado Bernal (died at 52 years old because of pancreatic cancer) was housewife and amateur performer of Spanish traditional music. Rocío Jurado was the eldest of 3 children, Amador (1954) and Gloria (1955) and she had 3 nephews and 5 nieces. At home, Rocío Jurado learned to love music; her first public performance was at the age of eight, in a play at Colegio La Divina Pastora. She learn to work hard when she was a girl, She sang in the church, and took part in some festivals organized by her school when she was fifteen years. After her father's death, she helped the precarious family finances. She worked as a shoemaker and as a fruit picker, and still had time to show up to Radio Sevilla contests. She came to be known as \\"The Girl of the Awards\\" after winning every radio station contest she entered. A friend of her mother introduced her to Manolo Caracol her teacher. Pastora Imperio immediately hired Rocío for the tablao (flamenco stage) she ran: El Duende, one of the first of the tablaos period. Being a minor, she had to wear clothes that made her appear older to avoid drawing the attention of the authorities. Her workmate, the flamenco singer and dancer Cañeta de Málaga, who had also arrived in Madrid under age to seek her art and was hired in El Duende, recalls in an interview how the young Rocío sang \\"sus alegrías, sus tientos y sus cosas de la Piquer\\". Rocío had always said that she was born in 1944 because when she arrived in Madrid to sing in 1960 she was a minor. Until she was 16 she could not sing in the tablaos, for this reason she falsified her date of birth, adding two years more and saying that she was born in 1944 instead of 1946. == Artistic life == Professionally, Rocío Jurado emerged with a repertoire mostly of copla, a Spanish traditional genre that was beginning to lose force which she revitalized with energetic performances, as much in voice as in stage presence. Popular in the 60's and early 70's, in part by some appearances as an actress in television and film as in the Curro Jiménez series, Rocío made the leap to international star status by leaning toward a melodic repertoire of romantic ballad with orchestral instruments and a personal image (make-up, hairdressing and costumes) in line with the European style. Rocío alternated the flamenco tailed dress (bata de cola) with sumptuous evening dresses, sometimes highly commented on by their audacity. In the 70's and 80's Rocios recorded her most unmistakable successes: \\"Como una ola\\", \\"Señora\\", \\"Como yo te amo\\", \\"Ese hombre\\", \\"Se nos rompió el amor\\", \\"A que no te vas\\", \\"Muera el amor\\", \\"Vibro\\"... Many of them composed by Manuel Alejandro and recorded by José Antonio Álvarez Alija. The prolonged celebrity of Rocío lies in the romantic songs rather than in its purely Spanish folkloric facet. She was famous for these ballads also in Hispano-America, where perhaps she remained in fashion for longer than in Spain, which explains her later scores with Mexican and Caribbean rhythms: \\"Me ha dicho la luna\\", \\"Te cambio mi bulería\\"...She recorded duets with famous figures from that continent: with José Luis Rodríguez \\"El Puma\\" the song \\"Amigo amor\\" and with Ana Gabriel the ambiguous song \\"Amor silencio\\". In 1990 participated in a show of tribute to Lola Flores in Miami, in which she recorded the duet \\"Dejándonos la piel\\". Nevertheless, the romantic successes of international reach did not remove Rocío from its more Andalusian facet. The most convincing declaration of Rocío Jurado in this sense would arrive years later when already she was an outstanding interpreter of the copla and ballads. In 1982 she applied her extraordinary talents to flamenco singing in a double LP with the collaboration of two main figures of this genre: the guitarist Manolo Sanlúcar and the singer Juan Peña \\"Lebrijano\\". Titled Ven & Sígueme, she discovered that the famous singer also moved with ease on the roads of Cante jondo. In spite of an already well-developed lyric, the multifaceted artist demonstrates her knowledge and her compass in a series of rigorously traditional folk singing and interpreted with great affection. The filmmaker Carlos Saura took notice and used the voice of Rocío in two feature films: El amor brujo with Cristina Hoyos in 1986 and Sevillanas in 1992 where she plays with such important figures in the flamenco world as Paco de Lucía, Camarón de la Isla, Tomatito, Lola Flores, Manuela Carrasco or Matilde Coral among many others. Rocío Jurado was one of the protagonists of the spectacle Azabache, a musical based on Andalusian copla in which she took part with other artists specialized in this genre, such as Nati Mistral, Juanita Reina, Imperio Argentina and María Vidal. They released this spectacle during the Universal Exposition of Seville in 1992 (Expo '92). In 1998, on the occasion of the Festival of Jerez de la Frontera dedicated to flamenco dancing, the Theatre Villamarta had to announce that they were sold out for the Rocio's gala weeks before the spectacle and before any other spectacles. An homage to the singer was made with the adaptation using \\"bulerías\\", a Flamenco variety of the song \\"Se nos rompió el amor\\" made by Fernando de Utrera. This song was originally composed by Manuel Alejandro but it was Rocío who had made it popular. Rocio's voice was recognised internationally. She was awarded with the Best Female Voice of the 20th century in 2000. This award was conceded in 2000 in New York City by a group of journalists of the spectacle. In addition, in 1985, she sang for the President of the United States of America, Ronald Reagan in the White House. She was so popular that her death merited an article in the Billboard website. On April 2, 1988, Rocío received the award \\"América\\", which recognised the Best Latin Voice. The ceremony took place at the Caesars Palace Casino (Las Vegas). The Spanish channel Antena 3 announced in 2011 the shooting of a TV Movie (mini series) about Rocio's life. It will be soon released and its title will be Como alas al viento. ==Illness and death== In August 2004 she had a high-risk surgery in the Montepríncipe Hospital (Madrid). Later, in September 17 she would announce that she had pancreatic cancer in a press conference. In June 2005 the XIV \\"Festival de la Yerbabuena\\" was dedicated to her at Las Cabezas de San Juan, a village from Seville. She accepted with her childhood friend Juan Peña \\"El Lebrijano\\" the award which was given to her father. After more than a year of professional inactivity, Rocío re-appeared in December 2005 with a special programme in the Spanish Public Television (TVE) called Rocío, siempre, where she demonstrated her condition. The spectacle, which was filmed in two different sessions included an important part dedicated to the folkloric music and the other to her famous ballads and other of her hits. She sang in duet some of the songs with the most famous Spanish singers: Raphael, Mónica Naranjo, Paulina Rubio, David Bisbal, and Malú, among others.Rocío Jurado's brother denies she died of a stroke , canada.com; accessed 18 May 2014. In January 2006, Rocío Jurado was hospitalized in the MD Anderson Hospital in Houston (Texas), for a check-up and to have a small surgery. An allergic reaction to one of the medicines provoked her hospitalization in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) two times, which delayed her coming back to Spain until March 2006. The same day she had to come back to Spain, the government gave her an award for her work merits (Medalla al Mérito en el Trabajo), which was announced to her once she landed in Spain. On June 1, 2006 at 4:15 Jurado was found dead in her house in La Moraleja, an affluent residential area located in the municipality of Alcobendas, a northern suburb of Madrid. The cause of death was the pancreatic cancer she had been struggling with. Her brother and manager, Amador Mohedano Jurado, announced her death in front of the residence at 6 o’clock in the morning. Her body was transferred to the Centro Cultural de la Villa at Plaza de Colón in central Madrid, where a funeral chapel attended by more than 20,000 individuals was installed. Finally, her body was transferred to Chipiona and buried at the local San José cemetery, where a mausoleum was built in her honour. == Private life == Rocío was the first to substitute the typical regional costume with formal dresses with an international style, although she never forgot her origins. On May 21, 1976, when she got married with the boxer Pedro Carrasco at the Sanctuary Virgen de Regla, she wore a traditional costume with a comb and flounces. They only had one daughter, Rocío Carrasco Mohedano. In private, she sometimes recognized that she did not have time to dedicate to her daughter; she had long tours in America and Europe which drove her away from her daughter. After she got divorced in July 1989 and after obtaining the marriage annulment, Rocío got married with the bullfighter José Ortega Cano on February 17, 1995 at her house in the country Dehesa Yerbabuena, in front of more 2300 guests. The ceremony was broadcast live (and prerecorded) on all the television channels. At the end of 1999, the couple adopted two Colombian children, José Fernando and Gloria Camila, who were presented in public in the Spanish magazine ¡Hola!. ==Honours== * Hija Predilecta of Chipiona (1968) * Plaque Company De Castilla, beating box office record for both public attendance, as revenue at the Teatro Monumental in Madrid, with its series of \\"Rocío Jurado Brava\\" concerts (1986) * ABC Gold Award (1987) * Humanity Award, awarded by ASPACE (Spanish Confederation of Federations and Associations of Care for People with Cerebral Palsy and Allied; 1992) * Gold Medal of Fine Arts from Don Juan Carlos I, King of Spain (1995) * Ambassador of Cadiz (1996). * Pimiento de Oro (Ciudad de Murcia; 1999) * Honorary member of the American Forum of the Arts (July 2002 – death) * Golden Star Press (2004) * Gold Medal of Merit in Labour (Kingdom of Spain, 24 March 2006).Boletín Oficial del Estado * Best Female Voice of the Twentieth Century - \\"The Voice of the Millennium Prize\\" (2000; New York) * Hija Predilecta of the Province of Cádiz (1999) * Gold Medal of Merit in Labour (2006) * Hija Adoptiva of the Province of Seville (2007; posthumous) == Awards == In Spain * Flamenco Singing National Award (Jerez de la Frontera).

The word sopaipilla is the diminutive of sopaipa, a word that entered Spanish from the Mozarabic language of Al-Andalus. The original Mozarabic word Xopaipa was used to mean bread soaked in oil. A similar word exists in Hebrew, \\"copaiba\\", as this was brought to Northern New Mexico by the Ladino-speaking crypto-Jews who first settled there and laid the foundation for the unique dialect of New Mexican Spanish. The word is derived in turn from the Germanic word suppa, which meant bread soaked in liquid.Correa, Adriana. Comida de larga tradición Diario de Cuyo A sopaipilla is traditionally made from leavened wheat dough (or a mixture of wheat flour and masa harina) to which some shortening or butter is added. After being allowed to rise, the dough is rolled into a sheet that is then cut into circular, square or triangular shapes. The shapes are 8–10 cm in size for the longest dimension (if intended for a dessert) or 15–20 cm (if intended to be stuffed for a main course). The shapes are then deep-fried in oil, sometimes after allowing them to rise further before frying: the frying causes the shapes to puff up, ideally forming a hollow pocket in the center.Cynthia Detterick- Pineda. Recipe: New Mexico Sopapillas. URL: http://whatscookingamerica.net/CynthiaPineda/Sopapillas/Sopapillas.htm ==Variations== ===Argentina=== Torta frita, Argentina and Uruguay In Argentina, pastry is known under other names apart from sopaipa, supaipa and sopaipilla; other names include Torta frita, Kreppel, and chipá cuerito. ===Chile=== Central Chilean sopaipillas pasadas (soaked), and without chancaca sauce In Chile, sopaipillas (or sopaipas) are known to have been eaten at least since 1726. Although Traditional Chilean sopaipillas (made in the central part of Chile) include cooked ground pumpkin in their dough, this is typically not the case in the South of Chile. Depending if they are served as a pastry or bread Chilean sopaipillas are traditionally served with either pebre (a sauce of chili pepper, onion, garlic and coriander) or boiled in chancaca sauce (a homemade hot syrup cooked with panela, orange peel and cinnamon, and then they are called sopaipillas pasadas). They are also served with mustard, ketchup, hot butter, avocado or cheese. In Chile sopaipillas are traditionally homemade and eaten during days of heavy rain, as well as enjoying widespread popularity as street food. Chilean sopaipillas are round and flat, sporting holes pricked through the centre of the dough, usually by a fork. Sopaipillas pasadas is the name given to Central Chilean sopaipillas served with chancaca sauce Sopaipillas from Chiloé. In Chiloé Archipelago and neighbor zones, sopaipillas have rhomboid form, they are usually sweet and served with jam or honey. They are a relevant ingredient in reitimientos, a traditional feast related to rendering fats after a pig slaughter. ===Peru=== In Peru, the name for this fried pastry is cachanga, and it may be either sweet or sour. Generally prepared during breakfast time, this traditional food of the Peruvian cuisine is prepared differently depending on the region, with one of the recipes involving the usage of cinnamon. The main difference between this form of sopaipilla and the other versions is that they are larger, thinner, and more rigid. ===United States=== Sopapillas in New Mexican cuisine are distinct from Latin American sopapaillas. New Mexican sopapillas are pillow-shaped fried pastry dough. They are typically served as a bread, and used to mop up sauces, scoop up tidbits, or shredded into stews. In northern New Mexico, they are often filled with savory ingredients such as ground beef or chicken, covered with chile and cheese, and served with lettuce and tomato as an entree, but such \\"stuffed sopaipillas\\" are a relatively new innovation and are still fairly unknown in the southern part of the state. They are sometimes eaten as a dessert, drizzled with honey or anise syrup. but are often eaten this same way during the meal itself as New Mexican cuisine tends to be very spicy and sweet syrups reduce the sensations of heat. Sopapillas in Tex-Mex cuisine are a puffed pastry, but otherwise similar to New Mexican-style sopapillas, except that they are always served as a dessert item, coated with cinnamon sugar and served with honey. Many Tex-Mex restaurants in Texas and Oklahoma will serve dessert sopapillas as part of the complimentary \\"set-up\\": chips and salsa served before the meal, along with sometimes queso sauce, pickled vegetables and flour tortillas and sopapillas served at the end of the meal. Sopaipilla and strudel were together designated as Texas' state pastries from 2003 to 2005. ===Uruguay=== In Uruguay, a variant of the Sopaipilla is known as Torta frita. Tortas fritas made in Uruguay are stretched into a thin large shaped dough. They are usually salty, but it is a common custom to cover them with sugar and eat them as a snack. They are commonly prepared on rainy days. ==See also== * Buñuelos (Mexico) * Mueganos (Mexico) * Frybread * List of quick breads * List of doughnut varieties * List of fried dough varieties * ==Notes== ==References== ==Further reading== * ==External links== * \\"sopaipilla\\", Webster's New World College Dictionary * Chilean-Style Sopapillas, or Pumpkin Fritters from The Spruce Eats * How to Make New Mexico Style Sopaipillas Category:American desserts Category:Argentine cuisine Category:Bolivian cuisine Category:Chilean breads Category:Cuisine of the Southwestern United States Category:Doughnuts Category:New Mexican cuisine Category:Peruvian cuisine Category:Quick breads Category:Tex-Mex cuisine Category:Uruguayan cuisine ","title":"Sopaipilla"},{"id":"1282994","text":"Rocío Carrasco Mohedano, informally Rociíto (born 29 April 1977), is a Spanish TV presenter and business woman.

Featuring sleuth Kinsey Millhone, it is set in the southern California city of Santa Teresa, the nom de plume for Santa Barbara. She wrote the book during a divorce and admits about her husband that she \\"would lie in bed at night thinking of ways to kill him\\". The New York Times gave the book a lukewarm review. ==Plot summary== Kinsey Millhone, 32, private detective investigates the death of prominent divorce lawyer Laurence Fife. His murder eight years earlier was blamed on his wife, Nikki Fife. Upon being released from prison, Nikki hires Kinsey to find the real murderer. In the course of the investigation, Kinsey becomes involved with Charlie Scorsoni, the late Mr. Fife's former law partner. She discovers Fife's death has been linked to that of a woman in Los Angeles, his law firm's accountant; both died after taking poisonous oleander capsules, which had been substituted for allergy pills. Kinsey tracks down the accountant's parents and former boyfriend. She then goes to Las Vegas to interview Fife's former secretary, Sharon Napier, who is killed minutes before Kinsey arrives. Back in California, Kinsey is mystified that Nikki's son, Colin, recognizes Laurence's first wife, Gwen, in a photograph. Kinsey surmises that Gwen was having an affair with her ex-husband at the time of his death. She accuses Gwen, who confesses. Shortly afterwards, she too is dead, killed in a hit-and-run crash. Kinsey has solved the case she was hired to investigate; but in a plot twist, she discovers that her previous notions about the accountant's death were entirely wrong: in fact, it was Scorsoni who killed her when she discovered he was skimming dividend money from estate accounts under his management. Scorsoni used the same method that Gwen used to kill Fife, so it would be assumed the same person committed both murders. In a final confrontation, he chases Kinsey across the beach, armed with a knife. Kinsey hides in the shore line, and she is forced to remove her shoes and pants. Before Scorsoni can kill her, she shoots him dead. A secondary storyline involves Millhone's surveillance of Marcia Threadgill, suspected of insurance fraud in a trip-and-fall case. Although Millhone believes she has successfully documented Threadgill's deception, the insurance firm that contracted Millhone to investigate Threadgill moves to pay her claim anyway, citing potential legal costs and complications, including the risk of reprisal. ==Publication history== The first printing of \\"A\\" Is for Alibi was 7,500 copies, with initial sales of about 6,000. ==Critical analyis== Grafton openly admits that she conceived the story from her own \\"fantasies\\" of murdering her husband while going through a divorce. The novel's style typical hardboiled detective fiction, according to the authors of 'G' is for Grafton, who describe it as \\"laconic, breezy, wise-cracking\\".Kaufman (1997), 385 Grafton frames the narrative as a report Kinsey Millhone writes during the course of her investigation, written in the First-person narrative.Kaufman (1997), 386 \\"A\\" for Alibi is dedicated to author Chip Grafton, Sue Grafton's father, \\"who set me on this path\\". Chip Grafton was a municipal bond attorney in Kentucky who pursued a secondary career as a crime novelist, winning minor acclaim for four novels. He died on January 1, 1982 at age 72, four months before 'A' is for Alibi was published. ==Reviews== Kirkus Reviews said this was a \\"shakily plotted but otherwise terrific start for a new detective series\\", writing when the book was released. They look forward to the rest of the Alphabet Series, \\"fine dialogue, a great eye for people and places\\", if the author can tighten up her plots. Looking back at the series soon after the author's death, Library Journal Reviews remarked on the slow build up to successful reviews, including a quote from its own review: \\"Critic Sarah Weinman notes that pseudonymous New York Times critic Newgate Callendar dismissed A Is for Alibi as \\"competent enough, but not particularly original.\\" Alas, LJ's reviewer was equally unenthusiastic in an April 1, 1982, review, waving the book aside as \\"nothing to take it out of the ordinary.\\" Before those less enthusiastic words, they had said, \\"The female detective is well drawn and the plot moves at a fast clip\\". ==References== ==Sources== * ==Further reading== * * ==External links== *Sue Grafton Alphabet Series official site Category:1982 American novels Category:American mystery novels Category:Novels by Sue Grafton Category:Kinsey Millhone novels Category:Henry Holt and Company books Category:Novels set in California ","title":"&quot;A&quot; Is for Alibi"},{"id":"1283010","text":"The Sweden Rock Festival is an annual rock/metal festival held in Sweden since 6 June 1992. While having a clear rock/metal focus, the festival is noted for its diversity across these genres, from southern rock bands such as Molly Hatchet to death metal legends like Obituary. The first version of the festival, known as Sommarfestivalen i Olofström, was held in Olofström in 1992. In 1993 the festival moved to Karlshamn, and changed its name to Karlshamn Rock Festival. In 1998, the festival moved to Norje, although the name Karlshamn Rock Festival was kept. In 1999 the name was changed to the Sweden Rock Festival. When the festival first began in 1992, it featured nine relatively unknown bands and it only lasted one day. The next year the festival was expanded to two days and more bands were added to the line-up. From 1993 to 2002 the festival would last two days; over those years it would also begin to feature bigger name acts. In 2000 the festival was expanded to three days but it returned to two days the following year. From 2003 to 2006 the festival lasted three days and had by then featured some of the biggest acts in metal and rock. From 2007 the festival has been expanded to four days and will feature approximately 120 different bands/artists. Some notable appearances in the past have been Aerosmith, Iron Maiden, Judas Priest, Mötley Crüe, Dio, Bruce Dickinson, Yngwie Malmsteen, Twisted Sister, Whitesnake, Uriah Heep, Europe, Deep Purple, Accept, Motörhead, Saxon, Nazareth, Poison, Status Quo, Lynyrd Skynyrd, Scorpions, Porcupine Tree, Kamelot, Def Leppard, Alice Cooper, Testament, W.A.S.P, ZZ Top, The Orchestra, Thin Lizzy, Ted Nugent, Slayer and Guns N' Roses.

In pure grappling combat sports, the guard is considered an advantageous position, because the bottom combatant can attack with various joint locks and chokeholds, while the top combatant's priority is the transition into a more dominant position, a process known as passing the guard. In the sport of mixed martial arts, as well as hand-to-hand combat in general, it is possible to effectively strike from the top in the guard, even though the bottom combatant exerts some control. There are various types of guard, with their own advantages and disadvantages. The guard is a key part of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu where it can be used as an offensive position. It is also used, but not formally named, in JudoJimmy Pedro. The Pedro Guard Pass by Jimmy Pedro though it is sometimes referred to as dō-osae in Japanese, meaning \\"trunk hold\\".Miller, Chris. Grappling/Submission Fighting. hsma1.com. URL last accessed on March 4, 2006. It is called the \\"front body scissor\\" in catch wrestling. ==Pulling Guard== Transitioning directly from standing to the guard position is known as pulling guard. Tsunetane Oda, a judo groundwork specialist who died in 1955,Toshikazu Okada. Master Tsunetane Oda demonstrated the technique on video.Tsunetane Oda - judo ne-waza 2 of 3 ==Closed Guard== The closed guard Sometimes referred to as full guard, the closed guard is the typical guard position. In this guard the legs are hooked behind the back of the opponent, preventing them from standing up or moving away. The opponent needs to open the legs up to be able to improve positioning. The bottom combatant might transit between the open and closed guard, as the open guard allows for better movement, but also has a bigger risk of the opponent passing the guard. ==Open Guard== USMC Close Combat manual The open guard is typically used to perform various joint locks and chokeholds. The legs can be used to move the opponent, and to create leverage. The open guard allows the opponent to stand up or try to pass the guard, so this position is often used temporarily to set up sweeps or other techniques. Open guard is also a general term that encompasses a large number of guard positions where the legs are used to push, wrap or hook the opponent without locking the ankles together around them. ===Butterfly Guard=== The butterfly guard being used during Judo training. The judogi of the top combatant is grabbed to prevent him from moving away. The butterfly guard involves both of the legs being hooked with the ankles in between the opponents legs, against the inside of the opponents thighs. The opponent is controlled using both legs and arms. The leverage in the butterfly guard allows powerful sweeps. The guard also allows one to elevate or set the opponent off balance and because of this it is particularly useful in avoiding damage and allows transitions to other dominant positions. The analogous technique in wrestling and catch wrestling is called double elevator. ===X-Guard=== The x-guard being used in BJJ competition The X-guard is an open guard where one of the combatants is standing up and the other is on their back. The bottom combatant uses the legs to entangle one of the opponent's legs, which creates opportunities for powerful sweeps. The X-guard is often used in combination with butterfly and half guard. In a grappling match, this is an advantageous position for the bottom combatant, but in general hand-to-hand combat, the top combatant can attack with stomps or soccer kicks. Likewise, skilled use of the x-guard can prevent the opponent from attempting a kick, or throw them off balance should they raise a leg. For instance, in the first round of the UFC196 fight between Conor McGregor and Nate Diaz, McGregor used the x-guard to sweep Diaz after Diaz stood in McGregor's butterfly guard. The x-guard has been used in Judo before being popularised by Marcelo Garcia. ===Spider Guard=== This position can be considered a type of spider guard. The spider guard comprises a number of positions all of which involve controlling the opponents arms while using the soles of the feet to control the opponent at the biceps, hips, thighs or a combination of them. It is most effective when the sleeves of the opponent can be grabbed. The spider guard can be used for sweeps and to set up joint locks or chokeholds. ===Jimahiva Guard=== The Jimahiva guard being used in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu training The Jimahiva guard (also called the Jimahiva hook and jello guard) is an open guard that has been used in Judo before being popularized in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu by white belt Jiminho, who was successful with it in competition. The guard consists of one of the legs wrapped behind the opponent's leg from the outside, the ankle held with one hand, and the other hand grips one of their sleeves. The Jimahiva guard offers a number of sweeps, transitions and submissions, and is more recently used in combination with spider guard. ===Rubber Guard=== Rubber Guard diagram, a red figure holding blue figure in the rubber guard. The rubber guard a position that keeps an opponent down in your guard. Similar positions have been seen in Judo before being commonly used in Brazilian jiu-jitsu by Nino Schembri, then popularized and made a system by Eddie Bravo. Many techniques have been developed from this position including sweeps, submissions, and striking defense. By using a leg to hold an opponent down, one arm is free to work on submissions, sweeps or to strike the opponent's trapped head. ===50-50 Guard=== Megaton Dias demonstrating the 50-50 guard The 50-50 (Fifty-fifty) guard is a position popularized by Roberto “Gordo” Correa and extensively used by the Mendes Brothers, Rafael and Guilherme Mendes, Bruno Frazzato, Ryan Hall and Ramon Lemos from the Atos Jiu-Jitsu Team. In other grappling systems such as catch wrestling and Sambo, it is a form of the \\"outside leg triangle\\" type of leg control. In this position, the fighter on the bottom crosses a triangle on the opponent's leg, which allows for the leg to be dominated while leaving the arms free to work on sweeps and submissions. This position has been heavily criticized for use in competitions with restricted use of leglocks due to the potential of stalling a match when the fighter on top cannot pass the guard and the fighter on the bottom cannot successfully perform a sweep. ==Passing the Guard== In order to overcome the primary defense of one's opponent, their guard, and attain a more dominant position, such as side mount, full mount, or knee on stomach a practitioner must pass the guard. There are several ways of doing so; many involve pain compliance whereby the practitioner persuades the opponent to release their guard through an abrasive action. Examples of this type of action would be digging the practitioner's forearms into the inner thigh of the opponent, standing and attempting a can opener neck crank, or in the case of a mixed martial arts setting, to simply strike the opponent until the guard is released. Passing the guard however has perils of its own, as it has a tendency to leave the practitioner particularly vulnerable to counterattack in the form of sweeps and submissions. ===Simple guard pass=== Simple guard pass also known as the arm/leg pull is a guard pass demonstrated in The Essence Of Judo by Kyuzo Mifune, and it is an unnamed technique described in The Canon Of Judo. In Brazilian Jiu Jitsu this pass is commonly referred to as the Toreando/Bull Fighter Pass. The main characteristic of the pass is the practitioner side-stepping around the opponent's legs whilst simultaneously pulling aside the opponent's leg or pinning the opponents legs to the ground. === Stacking guard pass === Stacking Guard Pass is also demonstrated in The Essence Of Judo by Mifune, and it is also an unnamed technique described in The Canon Of Judo. The main characteristic of the technique is the practitioner lifting the opponent and stacking them, into a possible neck crank or blood choke submission, when the practitioner is in the opponent's open guard. ===Near knee guard pass=== Near Knee Guard Pass is also demonstrated in The Essence Of Judo by Mifune as well as Canon of Judo by Mifune. In Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, this guard pass is commonly referred to as the Knee Over Pass. The main characteristic of this pass is the practitioner driving their knee over the opponent's same side thigh while in the opponent's open guard. ==See also== * Half guard * Grappling * Grappling hold * Brazilian Jiu-jitsu * Judo ==Footnotes== ==References== ==Further reading== * Løvstad, Jakob.

The hystricognath mole-rats of the family Bathyergidae are completely unrelated, but some other forms are also in the family Spalacidae. Zokors (subfamily Myospalacinae), root rats, and bamboo rats (subfamily Rhizomyinae) are spalacids sometimes referred to as mole rats. Blind mole rats are in the family Spalacidae, but are unique enough to be given a separate subfamily, Spalacinae. Alternate opinions on taxonomy consider the blind mole-rats to be the only members of the family Spalacidae and rank other spalacid subfamilies as full families. Other authors group all members of the superfamily Muroidea into a single family, Muridae. The Spalacinae contains two genera and eight species. Some authorities treat all species as belonging to a single genus, Spalax. Spalax mole rats are truly blind. Their very small eyes are completely covered by a layer of skin. Unlike many other fossorial rodents, Spalax mole rats do not have enlarged front claws and do not appear to use their forearms as a primary digging tool. Digging is almost exclusively conducted using their powerful front teeth, which are separated from the rest of the mouth by a flap of skin. When a Spalax mole rat closes its mouth, its incisors are still on the outside. Blind mole rats may have evolved from spalacids that used their front limbs to dig, because their olecranon processes are relatively large relative to the rest of their arms. The olecranon process is a part of the ulna bone where muscles attach, and digging animals tend to have enlarged olecranon processes to provide a large surface for their large and powerful muscles to attach. Because they are completely blind, blind mole rats have been important laboratory animals in tests on how eyes and eye proteins function. Although Spalax has only atrophied subcutaneous eyes and it is sightless, its circadian rhythm is kept. Few publications (Avivi et al.) have proved that the circadian genes that control the biological clock are expressed in a similar manner as in sighted, above-ground mammals. == Resistance to cancer == Studies on the growth of fibroblasts in vitro of Spalax judaei and Spalax golani showed that the process of necrosis replaces the role of the systematic apoptosis normally used in most organisms. Generally low-oxygen conditions, such as those common in blind mole rats’ burrows, usually cause cells to undergo apoptosis. One study showed that in adaptation to a higher tendency of cell death, blind mole rats evolved a mutation in the tumor suppressor protein p53, also used in humans, to prevent cells from undergoing apoptosis. Human cancer patients have similar mutations, and blind mole rats were thought to be more susceptible to cancer because their cells cannot undergo apoptosis. However, after a specific amount of time (within 3 days according to one study), the cells in blind mole rats release interferon-beta (which the immune system normally uses to counter viruses) in response to over-proliferation of cells caused by the suppression of apoptosis. In this case, the interferon-beta triggers cells to undergo necrosis, and this mechanism also kills cancer cells in blind mole rats. Because of tumor suppression mechanisms such as this, blind mole rats and other spalacids are resistant to cancer. Retrieved 27 November 2012 The involvement of interferon in the so-called concerted cell death of Spalax cells via necrosis was highly criticized. Serious questions have been raised on the inconsistent methodology used that led to this speculation. ==Classification== Subfamily Spalacinae *Genus Spalax – Blind mole rats **Spalax antiquus **Sandy mole rat, Spalax arenarius **Mount Carmel blind mole rat, Spalax carmeli **Middle East blind mole rat, Spalax ehrenbergi **Upper Galilee Mountains blind mole rat, Spalax galili **Giant mole rat, Spalax giganteus **Golan Heights blind mole rat, Spalax golani **Balkan mole rat, Spalax graecus **Spalax istricus **Judean Mountains blind mole rat, Spalax judaei **Lesser mole rat, Spalax leucodon **Greater mole rat, Spalax microphthalmus **Munzur mole rat, Spalax munzuri **Nehring's blind mole rat, Spalax nehringi **Kazakhstan blind mole rat, Spalax uralensis **Podolsk mole rat, Spalax zemni ==References== 8 ^ Irena Manov, Mark Hirsh, Theodore C Iancu, Assaf Malik, Nick Sotnichenko, Mark Band, Aaron Avivi and Imad Shams† (2013) Pronounced cancer resistance in a subterranean rodent, the blind mole- rat, Spalax: in vivo and in vitro evidence.

It has been in the Cadonau family for several generations and was named after the alpine rose (Rosa pendulina) by the Swiss-born wife and early co-owner of the dairy. The grounds of the dairy include: *Circuit d'Alpenrose, a velodrome, one of only 25 such tracks in the United States. The track was built to host the 1967 National Championships. At 268.43 meters around with a radius and a 43-degree bank, Alpenrose is one of the steepest velodromes in the country. Alpenrose is home to the only North American Six-day race. It hosts races all summer, and annually draws the largest velodrome crowd in North America for the Alpenrose Challenge, in mid-July.

Products from Alpenrose include milk, ice cream, eggs, and various cultured dairy products. == Dairyville == Dairyville was added to Alpenrose sometime in the 1960s. As stated above, the replica frontier town consists of a few streets of false front stores, a doll museum, an ice cream parlor, a music shop and a 600-seat opera house. The theater's pipe organ was salvaged from the Portland Civic Auditorium. Dairyville is typically open to the public on holidays and during the summer months. For decades, Dairyville has hosted an annual holiday event called \\"Christmas in Dairyville.\\" In addition to a gift shop and a house where children can have their photos taken with Santa Claus, there's also \\"Storybook Lane,\\" an elaborate, walk-through attraction. Visitors wander through a snowy, moonlit mock-village inhabited by farm animals and displays based on Mother Goose's fables. The attraction also includes a tiny fire station for kids to play in. Elsewhere on the property, choir groups from local schools perform. Dairyville's opera house also hosts nightly screenings of comedy shorts featuring The Three Stooges and Laurel and Hardy, along with more contemporary entertainment like the 2004 film adaptation of The Polar Express. The event ended its annual run in 2005 but returned again for the 2011 Christmas season. == Lawsuit == On March 4, 2019, a lawsuit was filed in Multnomah County Circuit Court by three members of the Cadonau family against two other family members, alleging they are planning to sell the dairy and immediately stop all community events at Alpenrose. The family has since settled differences and dropped the lawsuit. ==References== == External links == * Category:Dairy products companies of the United States Category:Drink companies of the United States Category:Sports in Portland, Oregon Category:Manufacturing companies based in Portland, Oregon Category:Food and drink companies established in 1916 Category:Privately held companies based in Oregon Category:1916 establishments in Oregon Category:Food and drink companies based in Oregon ","title":"Alpenrose Dairy"},{"id":"1283023","text":"Samson using the jawbone of an ass \\"Jawboning\\" or \\"moral suasion\\" in economics and politics is an unofficial technique of public and private discussions and arm-twisting, which may work by the implicit threat of future government regulation. In America during the Democratic administrations of Presidents Kennedy and Johnson officials tried to deal with the mounting inflationary pressures by direct government influence or jawboning. Wage-price guideposts were established, and the power of the presidency was used to push businesses and labor into going along with these guideposts. The term attracted some derision and is often associated with the Biblical story, in Judges 15:15, of Samson slaying a thousand of his enemies using the jawbone of an ass. Alfred E. Kahn, an economic advisor to President Carter, was particularly known for his dislike of the method. The term jawboning has also been used to refer to Herbert Hoover's efforts to convince employers to keep wages high as prices fell during the Great Depression. While Hoover was successful in obtaining such agreements, they did little to alleviate unemployment. The term has been used more recently in other contexts. During the 2000 U.S. Presidential Election, George W. Bush criticized outgoing president Bill Clinton for not attempting to lower oil prices by \\"jawboning OPEC\\" to increase supply. The Canadian-American economist J. K. Galbraith stated that \\"jawboning\\" was first used to describe the activities of the U.S. Office of Price Administration and Civilian Supply, formed in April 1941.Galbraith, J. K. (1976).

It is the second most popular magazine in Spain after Pronto. The title means \\"Hello!\\" in English and it is the parent magazine of the English- language Hello! and Hello! Canada and Hola! USA. ==History and profile== ¡Hola! was founded in Barcelona on 2 September 1944 by Antonio Sánchez Gómez, who continued to run the magazine until his death in the 1970s. He employed mainly relatives and to this day ¡Hola! remains a predominantly family run organisation, with Sánchez's wife still stepping in to provide layout for important royal wedding spreads. Later the headquarters of the magazine moved to Madrid. Initially designed as a family magazine, Sánchez soon realized the potential for profit in the women's industry and initially focused on the doings of royalty, as well as offering a self-help section. Then the magazine became a gossip magazine, although the Spanish version still relies heavily on royalty for their gossip, whilst the English and Latin American versions focus more on Hollywood. The former Spanish Prime Minister Felipe González gave his first interview to the magazine when he was in office. The magazine continues to grow and its edition in Argentina was launched in 2010.Hola!

The kri-kri is now found only on the island of Crete, Greece and three small islands just offshore (Dia, Thodorou and Agii Pantes). The kri-kri has a light brownish coat with a darker band around its neck. It has two horns that sweep back from the head. In the wild they are shy and avoid humans, resting during the day. The animal can leap some distance or climb seemingly sheer cliffs. The kri-kri is not thought to be indigenous to Crete, most likely having been imported to the island during the time of the Minoan civilization. Nevertheless, it is found nowhere else and is therefore endemic to Crete. It was once common throughout the Aegean but the peaks of the 2,400 m (8,000 ft) White Mountains of Western Crete are their last strongholds—particularly a series of almost vertical 900 m (3,000 ft) cliffs called 'the Untrodden'--at the head of the Samaria Gorge. This mountain range, which hosts another 14 endemic animal species, is protected as a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve. In total, their range extends to the White Mountains, the Samaria National Forest and the islets of Dia, Thodorou, and Agii Pandes. Recently some were introduced onto two more islands. By 1960, the kri-kri was under threat, with a population below 200. It had been the only meat available to mountain guerillas during the German occupation in World War II. Its status was one reasons why the Samaria Gorge became a national park in 1962. There are still only about 2,000 animals on the island and they are considered vulnerable: hunters still seek them for their tender meat, grazing grounds have become scarcer and disease has affected them. Hybridization is also a threat, as the population has interbred with ordinary goats. Hunting them is strictly prohibited. Minoan rhyton from the Palace of Zakros, depicting a rocky landscape with Cretan goats. Archaeological excavations have unearthed several depictions of the kri-kri. Some academics believe that the animal was worshiped during antiquity. On the island, males are often called 'agrimi' (, i.e. 'the wild one'), while the name 'sanada' () is used for the female. The kri-kri is a symbol of the island, much used in tourism marketing and official literature. As molecular analyses demonstrate, the kri- kri is not, as previously thought, a distinct subspecies of wild goat. Rather, it is a feral domestic goat, derived from the first stocks of goats domesticated in the Levant and other parts of the Eastern Mediterranean around 8000-7500 BCE. Therefore, it represents a nearly ten-thousand-year-old \\"snapshot\\" of the first domestication of goats. In any case, the kri-kri is an emblem of Crete and has immense cultural significance there. Legally however, endangered species legislation would likely not apply (as this does not cover feral populations), but similar cases elsewhere have been covered under cultural heritage protection laws. ==See also== * :Category:Feral goats * Auckland Island Pig, redomesticated pig population * Campbell Island cattle, exterminated feral cattle population * Chillingham Cattle and White Park, culturally significant (semi-)feral cattle populations == References == *Bar- Gal, G.

Merrie Melodies cartoon directed by Chuck Jones. The short was released on December 18, 1948, and stars Porky Pig and Sylvester. ==Plot== Porky Pig purchases a new home from a real estate agent, which turns out to be an old Gothic-style house: the sort featured in murder mysteries and ghost stories. His cat Sylvester is frightened of the creepy- looking place, but Porky finds it \\"quaint\\" and \\"peaceful\\", and looks forward to his first night there. Sylvester is already holding onto the bottom of Porky's coat, unwilling to let go, when he is spooked by a bat and jumps inside the coat. Porky chastises him for being afraid of the bat and says he is going upstairs to bed, Sylvester can go sleep in the kitchen. Unknown to Porky, Sylvester clings to him all the way to the bedroom and into bed. When Porky discovers him in the bed, he kicks him down the stairs, telling him to stay in the kitchen. Before long, Sylvester sees that the house is overrun with mice; killer mice, in fact (one wearing an executioner's hood and carrying an axe, the rest looking like the Chuck Jones-created characters Hubie and Bertie), who are just in the process of carting off the previous owners' cat (resembling a grey-furred version of Sylvester) to the chopping block. Already shaking with terror, Sylvester's eyes go pin-point with fear and his heart visibly pounds in his chest. He races upstairs and into Porky's nightshirt. Porky begins scolding Sylvester, who interrupts this by demonstrating (in mime) what occurred downstairs. Porky criticizes the \\"ridiculous acting\\" and orders Sylvester back to the kitchen. Too frightened to comply, Sylvester pulls a gun from a dresser drawer and prepares to shoot himself in the head rather than face whatever fate the mice have in store for the pair. Porky disarms him and cannot believe how desperate his cat is. Realizing he has no choice, Porky allows Sylvester to share the bed. Four mice push the bed out of the window, and it sticks on a pole. Porky, half-asleep and thinking it is cold in the room, asks Sylvester to close the window \\"like a good kitty\\". Sylvester proceeds to do so, himself barely awake and walking on thin air, as the pole springs the bed back into the room. Sylvester closes a tiny curtain on a birdhouse, gets back into the bed that isn't there and falls to the ground. He comes through the bedroom door with a big lump on his head. At that moment, he sees that the mice are about to drop an anvil on Porky from a crawlspace above the bed. Sylvester grabs the anvil at the last moment. Porky awakes and sees Sylvester poised above him with it in his hands. Porky questions Sylvester's intentions before dropping it on the cat's head and leading the way back down the stairs, heading for the kitchen. Sylvester sees the hooded mouse roll a bowling ball down the banister, targeted directly at Porky, who has reached the bottom. Sylvester races and shoves Porky out of the way - so hard he ends up in the kitchen headfirst in the cat basket - and is knocked unconscious by the ball. Porky storms back from the kitchen (not noticing the basket being lowered below the floor) demanding to know why Sylvester pushed him like that. Seeing the cat knocked out, Porky suggests it is just a ploy to gain sympathy. Over the next few scenes, as he lifts Sylvester, carries him to the kitchen and puts him in the basket, a completely oblivious Porky barely escapes many attempts, via several tools and weapons, by the mice to kill him. Sylvester, out cold in the basket, is lowered below the floor just after 1 a.m. and is raised up again just before 4 a.m., without the basket and having turned completely light gray. Clearly traumatized, he makes his way to Porky's room where he wakes him up with pathetic mews. Porky is so startled he leaps into the ceiling light, then is angry, demanding Sylvester remove the \\"make-up\\", saying, \\"This is no time for comedy\\". Porky, sick and tired of Sylvester's 'foolishness', decides to go into the kitchen by himself to show Sylvester there is nothing to fear. After a few seconds of silence, Sylvester takes a look in the kitchen, and witnesses the mice parading as they did the cat, only now it is Porky, bound and gagged and on his way to be decapitated. As the mice take him away, Porky holds up a sign which reads \\"YOU WERE RIGHT, SYLVESTER\\". Out of fear, Sylvester scrambles out of the house. As he rests to catch his breath, his Conscience (a miniature Sylvester, wearing a wizard's robe and carrying a star-tipped wand) appears. He magically produces an easel on which the word 'coward' is written; then, with diagrams and charts, he reminds Sylvester how Porky raised him from a kitten, shows him the \\"comparative sizes\\" of a cat to a mouse, and demands that he gets back in there and \\"FIGHT!\\". Suddenly bursting with courage after all this, Sylvester grabs a tree branch for use as a weapon, then decides to use the whole tree instead and races back into the mouse-infested house to fight. He sends the hundreds of murderous rodents running for their lives, much to his conscience's delight. With the mice now all supposedly gone for good, Porky graciously apologizes to Sylvester and thanks him for saving his life. One leftover mouse (the executioner) pops out of the longcase clock behind Sylvester, wielding a mallet. Seeing this, Porky yells at Sylvester to look out, but the mouse clobbers Sylvester on the head, knocking him unconscious, much to Porky's shock. The mouse then yanks off his hood, revealing a Lew Lehr caricature with a Napoleon army hat, and declares, \\"Pussycats is the cwaziest peoples!\\" and chuckles. ==Availability== *VHS - The Looney Tunes Video Show - Volume 3 *LaserDisc - Looney Tunes After Dark *VHS - Looney Tunes: The Collectors Edition Volume 2 \\"Running Amuck\\" *VHS - Porky Pig (1990) *VHS - Special Bumper Collection (Vol. 4) (UK) *DVD - Looney Tunes Golden Collection: Volume 1, Disc Two (original opening and credits restored) *DVD - Saturday Morning Cartoons: 1960s Volume 2, Disc 1 (part of The Porky Pig Show, without the opening and closing titles) *Blu-ray, DVD - Looney Tunes Platinum Collection: Volume 1 ==Notes== *At one point Porky says he should have gotten a dog. This is in stark contrast to several other Porky cartoons directed by Chuck Jones, where Charlie Dog tries to get himself adopted by Porky, who says he doesn't want a dog. As this short was released after \\"Little Orphan Airedale\\", this could be Porky saying he regrets not adopting Charlie. *This is the first cartoon where Sylvester is given his name, as prior to that he was unnamed (or in the case of \\"Tweetie Pie\\" he was named \\"Thomas\\"). The name was given by Chuck Jones, as it was based on the scientific Latin name of a wild cat, which is Felis silvestris. This is also the first Sylvester cartoon directed by Chuck Jones. *This was only one of five post-1948 WB cartoons to get a Blue Ribbon reissue prior to 1956 - with the original credits cut.

In 1998, for the \\"THIS VERSION\\" of the short, the original opening and credits were restored. This print was used on the Golden Collection, without the notice at the end. *This was the first of three Jones cartoons which placed Porky Pig and Sylvester (in a rare non-speaking role as Porky's pet) in a spooky setting where only Sylvester was aware of the danger, the other two films being \\"Claws for Alarm\\" (1954) and \\"Jumpin' Jupiter\\" (1955). **This was the only entry in the trilogy in which Porky Pig does eventually realize the danger they are in. *Parts of this cartoon were used in the Halloween TV special, Bugs Bunny's Howl-oween Special. *The high-pitched yelling from the fleeing mice was re- used in Kiss Me Cat (when the mice family runs away from a \\"magnified\\" Pussyfoot) and Forward March Hare (when the soldiers run for cover as Bugs uses an ammunition shell to nail his calendar to a wall). Interestingly the former cartoon also depicts the cats as the heroes and the mice as the villains rather than vice versa, much like this cartoon. Both were also directed by Jones. ==ReferencesCategory:1948 films Category:1948 animated films Category:1940s comedy horror films Category:1948 horror films Category:Merrie Melodies shorts Category:Warner Bros.

When Gracie goes off to perform, she leaves her young son, Hippety Hopper, alone in her dressing room. Hippety slips on a pair of his mother's boxing gloves, and wanders off (along the way, treading in wet cement, much to the anger of the workman who is paving the new sidewalk, falling into a pink dress and causing several cars to crash). Meanwhile, Sylvester is bragging to his son about how he took on a mouse about his own size. Unfortunately, Hippety shows up behind him, leading Sylvester into a panic. Junior urges Sylvester to fight Hippety, as they both think he's a giant mouse, and says that if he doesn't, he'll \\"disillusion a child's faith in his father.\\" The result is a fight between Hippety and Sylvester. Hippety wins at first, but then Sylvester chases him off with an axe. Along the way, they pass the workman, who treads in his own cement as if daring the participants in the chase to do the same – but when they do not, he stands in the center of the sidewalk and plays \\"Taps\\" on a trumpet as he sinks. Sylvester is led to the circus, and right when Junior enters his sight, he starts gloating again (\\"... and if I ever catch ya again, I'll give ya the same thing! Only THIS time, I'll break BOTH your legs, you giant mouse, you!\\"). After gloating, Sylvester says he wished Hippety was twice as big, with 4 arms and 2 heads. Ironically, Gracie comes out with Hippety in her pouch, causing both the cats to run off. Hippety gives them a friendly wave good-bye, and the cartoon closes. ==Other appearances== Gracie makes a brief cameo during the final scene of Who Framed Roger Rabbit with several other Looney Tunes characters.

It was the band's only album to feature bass guitarist Mike Watt, who assisted the band in finishing the album after Martyn LeNoble left before all his bass tracks had been completed. There were three singles released from the album. In addition to Watt, many guest musicians lent their musical talents to various songs. The song \\"Porpoise Head\\" featured Daniel Ash, David J and Kevin Haskins from Bauhaus, Love and Rockets and the Bubblemen. Good God's Urge also marked a reunion of ex-Jane's Addiction guitarist Dave Navarro, who played guitar on the album track \\"Freeway,\\" with his former bandmates. The song also featured Navarro's Red Hot Chili Peppers bandmate, Flea, who would join Farrell, Perkins and Navarro for a Jane's Addiction reunion the following year. Farrell's then-girlfriend, Christine Cagle, appeared on the album cover.

Li's father Li Guangyu () received his jinshi degree in 1880 and served in minor official posts in the late 19th to early 20th century. Li was one of the first Chinese people to study linguistics outside China. Originally a student of medicine, he switched to linguistics when he went to the United States in 1924. He gained a B.A. in linguistics at the University of Michigan in 1926 after only two years of study. He then did graduate study under Edward Sapir and Leonard Bloomfield at the University of Chicago. Li conducted field studies of American Indian languages. His first exposure to fieldwork was his study of the Mattole language of northern California. He received an M.A. in 1927 and a Ph.D. in 1928, and his dissertation Mattole: An Athabaskan Language was published in 1930. In 1929 he returned to China and, along with Y.R. Chao and Luo Changpei, became a researcher at the Institute of History and Philology () of the Academia Sinica (then located at Beijing). From this point on, he performed field studies of several Tai languages (including the Zhuang people's Longzhou and Wuming dialects), while at the same time conducting deep investigations into Old Chinese and Tibetan. Li's revisions of Bernhard Karlgren's reconstructions of Middle Chinese and Old Chinese were widely used by students of ancient Chinese from their publication in the 1970s until the late 1990s. Li briefly taught Chinese language and linguistics at Yale University in 1938–39, and after World War II was professor of Chinese at the University of Washington from 1949 to 1969, and then at the University of Hawaii until his retirement. In 1977 he published a comparison of Tai languages, the result of more than forty years of research. He also worked at Academia Sinica, now in Taiwan, in 1973. Li died in San Mateo County, California, survived by his wife Xu Ying () and their daughter Lindy Li Mark, a professor of anthropology who taught at California State University, Hayward and the Chinese University of Hong Kong, as well as their son Peter Li and daughter Annie Li. Tsinghua University, his alma mater, began to publish his complete works in 2005. ==Selected works== *Li Fang-Kuei (1933). \\"Certain Phonetic Influences of the Tibetan Prefixes upon the Root Initials\\".

Established in 1890, it is one of the oldest student newspapers in the Netherlands. It is principally concerned with Dutch literature, media and politics. Since its establishment, Propria Cures (colloquially, PC) has been a forum for freethinkers, bohemians and rising talents. PC specialises in printing what no one else is willing or able to say, leading, over the years, to a number of quarrels and incidents. PC was banned during World War II. In 1958, editor Herbert Leupen wrote a critical obituary for Pope Pius XII, and, as a result, was kidnapped by a group of Catholic students from Delft. Propria Cures also became one of the few journals in post-war Dutch publishing history to have been convicted of blasphemy, when in 1965, the newspaper published a fictional interview with Jesus, referring to him as a \\"carpenter's son who pulled himself up through active self-help\\". The newspaper was fined 100 guilders. In 1975, printers refused to publish a drawing by Aat Velthoen showing Dutch prime minister Joop den Uyl having intercourse with Queen Juliana. Two pages of the newspaper remained empty. A week later, PC found another printer, willing to publish the drawing. In 1992, Propria Cures published a photo montage of writer Leon de Winter lying in a mass grave, expressing the opinion that De Winter was exploiting his Jewish background. PC was convicted in court and had to pay 10,000 guilders in damages as well as publish an apology. PC employs a large number of guest editors in addition to its regular staff. Its editors have often gone on to become well-known Dutch writers, media figures or politicians after their tenure, and have included figures like polemicist Menno ter Braak, poet and novelist J. Slauerhoff, Godfried Bomans, Hella Haasse, Hugo Brandt Corstius, sociologist Abram de Swaan, or former EU Commissioner Frits Bolkestein. Guest editors have included Willem Frederik Hermans, Karel van het Reve, Theo van Gogh, Youp van 't Hek, and Herman Koch.

It is the capital of the remote and mountainous region of Sfakiá, and is a small town of just 265 inhabitants (2011 census). It lies on the south coast near the end of the Imbros Gorge, 74 km south of Chania. It has two small harbours, where the ferry boats from Agia Roumeli dock, which in the summer bring the hikers from the Samaria Gorge to take buses back to the northern coast. From Hóra Sfakíon ferries also go to the nearby coastal town of Loutro and the island Gavdos. Hóra Sfakíon is a small village with a main harbourfront of tavernas, two minimarkets, a butcher, and a bakery. There is a quiet local beach immediately west of the village, and several pebbly beaches nearby. Hóra Sfakíon has a variety of tourist accommodations: rooms, studios, and apartments. The local economy is based on tourism, fishing, olive-oil production, and sheep and goat herding. Hóra Sfakíon prospered during the Venetian and Turkish occupations and up to the 18th century carried on a flourishing trade with its own small fleet. It was said to have had a hundred churches, but it suffered badly from wartime bombardment during the Battle of Crete and the Allied evacuation that followed. Hóra Sfakíon is famous as one of the centers of resistance against the occupying forces of both the Venetians and the Turks. The impenetrable White Mountains to the north combined with the rocky beaches on the south helped the locals fight off all invaders.

He was a strict nationalist, and a failed leader of the so-called Kapp Putsch. ==Early life== Kapp was born in New York City where his father Friedrich Kapp, a political activist and later Reichstag delegate for the National Liberal Party, had settled after the failed European revolutions of 1848. In 1870 the family returned to Germany and Kapp's schooling continued in Berlin at the Friedrich Wilhelm Gymnasium (High School). Wolfgang Kapp married Margarete Rosenow in 1884; the couple would have three children. Through his wife's family, Kapp acquired a family connection with politically conservative elements. In 1886, he graduated at the conclusion of his law studies at the University of Tübingen and was appointed to a position in the Finance Ministry the same year. ==Political activist== After an ordinary official career, Kapp became the founder of the Agricultural Credit Institute in East Prussia which achieved great success in promoting the prosperity of landowners and farmers in that province. He was consequently in close touch with the Junkers of East Prussia, and during the First World War made himself their mouthpiece in an attack on Chancellor Bethmann Hollweg. Kapp's pamphlet, entitled Die Nationalen Kreise und der Reichskanzler and published in the early summer of 1916, criticized German foreign and domestic policy under Hollweg. This pamphlet appeared about the same time as the attacks of \\"Junius Alter\\" and evoked an indignant reply from Hollweg in the Reichstag, in which he spoke of \\"loathsome abuse and slanders.\\" In 1917, along with Alfred von Tirpitz, Kapp founded the Deutsche Vaterlandspartei (Fatherland Party), of which he would briefly become chairman. He was one of a number of prominent figures of the right, including General Ludendorff and Waldemar Pabst, who set up in August 1919 the Nationale Vereinigung (de) (National Union), a right-wing think-tank which campaigned for a counter-revolution to install a form of conservative militaristic government. The Nationale Vereinigung did not, however, press for the restoration of the monarchy, the Kaiser having bowed to Army pressure and left for his exile in the Netherlands in November 1918. 1919, which saw the consolidation in Germany of the Weimar Republic, found Kapp a member of the Deutschnationale Volkspartei (German National People's Party). Germany's defeat in the First World War was seen by nationalists such as Kapp as a humiliation and a betrayal. He became an exponent of the Stab-in-the-back myth and a vehement critic of the Treaty of Versailles. In 1919 he was elected to the Reichstag as a monarchist. ==Putsch== :\\"We will not govern according to any theory\\", Wolfgang Kapp, 13 March 1920Kapp's proclamation as quoted in Waite R.,(1952) Vanguard of Nazism, Norton library, New York In March 1920 Hermann Ehrhardt, the leader of the Freikorps known as the Ehrhardt Brigade, was authorized by General Walther von Lüttwitz (Commander of Reichswehr Command Group I) to proceed and use the Marine Brigade to take Berlin from the Weimar Government. The Weimar government fled to Dresden and then on to Stuttgart in order to avoid arrest by rebel Reichswehr troops. Though proclaiming a new government and state administration, Kapp along with Lüttwitz failed to calculate the lack of support for such a coup. The majority of the old establishment, civil service, labour unions and general population did not side with the putschists and as a result the newly proclaimed state lasted for a mere two days before a General Strike was called by the SPD. The Reichswehr, under the command of Hans von Seeckt, failed to uphold their constitutional commitment as von Seeckt refused to defend the Republican government against the rebellious Freikorps units. The Weimar regime was saved by the public by means of the strike, but the Putsch did not succeed for other reasons. These include the lack of outward and active support from the military elite, judiciary and civil service who were reluctant to commit to the Putsch from its beginning. When the coup d'état failed Kapp fled to Sweden. After two years in exile, he returned to Germany in April 1922 to justify himself in a trial at the Reichsgericht. He died in custody in Leipzig shortly afterwards of cancer.Biography at the German Historical Museum ==References== ==External links== * Category:1858 births Category:1922 deaths Category:Politicians from New York City Category:American people of German descent Category:German Protestants Category:German Fatherland Party politicians Category:German National People's Party politicians Category:Members of the 13th Reichstag of the German Empire Category:Prussian politicians Category:University of Göttingen alumni Category:University of Tübingen alumni Category:Kapp Putsch participants Category:German exiles Category:German expatriates in Sweden Category:German people who died in prison custody Category:Prisoners who died in German detention Category:Deaths from cancer in Germany Category:German monarchists Category:Political party founders ","title":"Wolfgang Kapp"},{"id":"1283112","text":"Vincent Jones is a Canadian keyboardist and music producer.

The International Association of Employment Web Sites and dozens of other employment services organizations have objected. It has been suggested that subdomains of other domains, such as jobs.example.com, can be used without any new registrations on the part of the companies involved. However, there is no general consensus among companies or industry sectors for any such naming scheme, like there is for the www prefix and other prefixes, so the proponents of argue the domain can gain a market presence by allowing recruiters to communicate a simple, direct URL destination of employment opportunities to job seekers.

This report tests the mobile-readiness of the site using dotMobi's recommended best practices. dotMobi does not itself mandate any particular technology, but does recommends that .mobi sites produce user experiences consistent with their guidelines and specifically optimized for mobile phones. ==Reception== Websites may be optimized for the special capabilities and restrictions of mobile devices, such as smaller screens, device form/size, device input/output options, existence of embedded sensors (acceleration, location, touch, etc.), as well as human factors such as expectations of immediacy of results, context awareness under a shortened attention span (compared to non-mobile device use of the Internet). Although other top-level domains can technically employ the same optimizations for mobile phones, in practice, only a fraction of them do, thus necessitating content adaptation solutions. These retrofit the content to target devices independent from the original process of creating the site.All About the .mobi Extension , Domain Masters Radio Show, interview with Rick Fant, Director of \\"Internet's Discovery\\" in Vodafone Originally dotMobi tried promote creating two separate device-dependent World Wide Webs, one desktop- based and the other mobile-based, thus risks producing redundant content, according Tim Berners-Lee . Providing content tailored to particular devices can be done by other means than a specific TLD, such as using hostnames within an existing domain, HTTP content negotiation, cascading style sheets, or other forms of adaptation. The popularization of responsive web design has caused the domain name to be relocated for use on mobile services and mobile apps websites. ==See also== * Mobile computing * Mobile apps * Mobile web ==References== ==External links== * IANA .mobi whois information * .mobi Registry Agreement with ICANN Category:Generic top-level domains Category:Computer-related introductions in 2005 sv:Toppdomän#Generiska toppdomäner ","title":".mobi"},{"id":"1283119","text":"The Southern Front was a front, a formation about the size of an army group of the Soviet Army during the Second World War. The Southern Front directed military operations during the Soviet occupation of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina in 1940 and then was formed twice after the June 1941 invasion by Germany, codenamed Operation Barbarossa. During the Soviet occupation of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina in 1940, the Soviets deployed three armies (12th, 5th and 9th).Feldgrau.net, Invasion of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina Altogether the Soviet Southern Front opposing Bessarabia and Bukovina consisted of 32 (or 31) rifle divisions, 2 (or 3) motorised rifle divisions, 6 cavalry divisions, 11 tank brigades, 3 airborne brigades (one in reserve), 14 corps artillery regiments, 16 artillery regiments of the Reserve of the Supreme High Command and 4 heavy artillery divisions. These force totalled around 460,000 men, ca. 12,000 guns and mortars, ca. 3,000 tanks and 2,160 aircraft. ==First Formation== After the German invasion, the Southern Front was re-created on June 25, 1941 from the forces in the Moscow and Odessa Military Districts, and included the 9th Army. It was commanded by General Ivan V. Tiulenev from June 1941 to August 1941. Lieutenant General Dmitri I. Ryabyshev took over on 30 August 1941 and held command until 5 October, when Colonel General Yakov Cherevichenko took command, until December 1941. During 1941 the Front fought in the border battles in the southern Ukraine, defended Odessa, and then conducted the defense and successful counteroffensive at Rostov-on-Don.Keith E. Bonn & David Glantz, Slaughterhouse: The Handbook of the Eastern Front, Aberjona Press, 2005, p.303 Lieutenant General Rodion Ia. Malinovsky arrived in December and held the reins until July 1942. In 1942 the Front took part in the Donbass, Barvenko-Lozovaia, and Voronezh-Stalingrad (Volgograd) operations. According to Glantz and Bonn, the Front then suffered a notable failure at the Second Battle of Kharkov. The Front received additional forces from the (disbanded) Southwestern Front on July 12, 1942 and was formally disbanded on July 28, 1942, with the forces transferred to the North Caucasus Front. === Commanders === * Army General Ivan Tyulenev (21 June 1941 - 20 August 1941), * Lieutenant General Dmitry Ryabyshev (30 August 1941 - 5 October 1941), * Colonel General Yakov Cherevichenko (5 October 1941 - December 1941), * Lieutenant General Rodion Malinovsky (December 1941 - 28 June 1942). ==Second Formation== In July 1942, three armies (the 1st, 5th and 7th Reserve Armies) out of the Supreme High Command reserve were moved into the Stalingrad sector and redesignated the 64th, 63rd and 62nd armies respectively. They formed the core of the Stalingrad Front on 12 July. The Stalingrad Front was then divided into the Stalingrad Front, under General Lieutenant V.N. Gordov, and the Southeastern Front, under Colonel General Andrei I. Yeremenko on 7 August 1942 as the Battle of Stalingrad began. Stalin had actually taken the decision to split the two fronts on 3 August at 0300 despite protest from his advisors.Antony Beevor, 1999; John Erickson (historian), The Road to Stalingrad, 1993 via The Stalingrad Academy of Street Fighting The Tsaritsa gully in Stalingrad was the dividing line. Yeremenko's new South-Eastern Front included the 51st, 57th, and 64th Armies. They were then re-transformed into the Don and Southwestern Fronts on 28 September with the Southeastern Front becoming the Stalingrad Front (Second Formation).Bonn and Glantz, 2005, p.303-4 The Southern Front was re-formed from the Stalingrad Front on January 1, 1943, and Colonel General Andrei I.

He read English at King's College London and graduated in 1986. He worked briefly as a teacher and later as a freelance writer for reference-book publishers. In 1992 he won the Somerset Maugham Award for his first novel, Lemprière's Dictionary, about events surrounding the publication, in 1788, of John Lemprière's Bibliotheca Classica on classical mythology and history. The novel starts out as a detective story and mixes historical elements with steampunk-style fiction. Note David Horton's article on the German translation of Norfolk's Lempriere: It imagines the writing of Lemprière's dictionary as tied to the founding of the British East India Company and the Siege of La Rochelle generations before; it also visits the Austro-Turkish War. Norfolk based his second novel, The Pope's Rhinoceros, on the story of an actual animal; see Dürer's Rhinoceros. Themes in the work include the lost city of Vineta in the Baltic, the sack of Prato, and the Benin bronze-making culture on the river Niger. The third novel, In the Shape of a Boar, juxtaposes the flight of a Bukovina Jew in World War II with the legend of Atalanta in Calydon. ==Literary works== * Lemprière's Dictionary (1991) * The Pope's Rhinoceros (1996) * In the Shape of a Boar (2000) * John Saturnall's Feast (2012) == References == Category:1963 births Category:Living people Category:20th-century British novelists Category:21st-century British novelists Category:Alumni of King's College London Category:Associates of King's College Category:Postmodern writers Category:British male novelists Category:20th-century British male writers Category:21st-century British male writers ","title":"Lawrence Norfolk"},{"id":"1283127","text":"Hairdresser washing a woman's hair A hairdresser is a person whose occupation is to cut or style hair in order to change or maintain a person's image. This is achieved using a combination of hair coloring, haircutting, and hair texturing techniques. Most hairdressers are professionally licensed as either a hairdresser, a barber or a cosmetologist. ==History== ===Ancient hairdressing=== Hairdressing as an occupation dates back thousands of years. Ancient art drawings and paintings have been discovered depicting people working on another person's hair. Greek writers Aristophanes and Homer both mention hairdressing in their writings. In Africa, it was believed in some cultures that a person's spirit occupied his or her hair, giving hairdressers high status within these communities. The status of hairdressing encouraged many to develop their skills, and close relationships were built between hairdressers and their clients. Hours would be spent washing, combing, oiling, styling and ornamenting their hair. Men would work specifically on men, and women on other women. Before a master hairdresser died, they would give their combs and tools to a chosen successor during a special ceremony. In ancient Egypt, hairdressers had specially decorated cases to hold their tools, including lotions, scissors and styling materials. Barbers also worked as hairdressers, and wealthy men often had personal barbers within their home. With the standard of wig wearing within the culture, wigmakers were also trained as hairdressers. In ancient Rome and Greece household slaves and servants took on the role of hairdressers, including dyeing and shaving. Men who did not have their own private hair or shaving services would visit the local barbershop. Women had their hair maintained and groomed at their homes. Historical documentation is lacking regarding hairstylists from the 5th century until the 14th century. Hair care service grew in demand after a papal decree in 1092 demanded that all Roman Catholic clergymen remove their facial hair. ===Europe=== A caricature of a French hairdresser at the Académie de Coiffure, working on a large hairstyle, fashionable of the time, in the 18th century. The first appearance of the word \\"hairdresser\\" is in 17th century Europe, and hairdressing was considered a profession. Hair fashion of the period suggested that wealthy women wear large, complex and heavily adorned hairstyles, which would be maintained by their personal maids and other people, who would spend hours dressing the woman's hair. A wealthy man's hair would often be maintained by a valet. It was in France where men began styling women's hair for the first time, and many of the notable hairdressers of the time were men, a trend that would continue into contemporary times. The first famous male hairdresser was Champagne, who was born in Southern France. Upon moving to Paris, he opened his own hair salon and dressed the hair of wealthy Parisian women until his death in 1658. Women's hair grew taller in style during the 17th century, popularized by the hairdresser Madame Martin. The hairstyle, \\"the tower,\\" was the trend with wealthy English and American women, who relied on hairdressers to style their hair as tall as possible. Tall piles of curls were pomaded, powdered and decorated with ribbons, flowers, lace, feathers and jewelry. The profession of hairdressing was launched as a genuine profession when Legros de Rumigny was declared the first official hairdresser of the French court. In 1765 de Rumigny published his book Art de la Coiffure des Dames, which discussed hairdressing and included pictures of hairstyles designed by him. The book was a best seller amongst Frenchwomen, and four years later de Rumigny opened a school for hairdressers: Academie de Coiffure. At the school he taught men and women to cut hair and create his special hair designs. By 1777, approximately 1,200 hairdressers were working in Paris. During this time, barbers formed unions, and demanded that hairdressers do the same. Wigmakers also demanded that hairdressers cease taking away from their trade, and hairdressers responded that their roles were not the same, hairdressing was a service, and wigmakers made and sold a product. de Rumigny died in 1770 and other hairdressers gained in popularity, specifically three Frenchmen: Frederic, Larseueur, and Léonard. Leonard and Larseueur were the stylists for Marie Antoinette. Leonard was her favorite, and developed many hairstyles that became fashion trends within wealthy Parisian circles, including the loge d'opera, which towered five feet over the wearer's head. During the French Revolution he escaped the country hours before he was to be arrested, alongside the king, queen, and other clients. He emigrated to Russia, where he worked as the premier hairdresser for Russian nobility. ===19th century=== A hairdresser cutting a child's hair, March 26, 1866 Rotating sign outside a hairdresser in Ystad 2019. Parisian hairdressers continued to develop influential styles during the early 19th century. Wealthy French women would have their favorite hairdressers style their hair from within their own homes, a trend seen in wealthy international communities. Hairdressing was primarily a service affordable only to those wealthy enough to hire professionals or to pay for servants to care for their hair. In the United States, Marie Laveau was one of the most famous hairdressers of the period. Laveau, located in New Orleans, began working as a hairdresser in the early 1820s, maintaining the hair of wealthy women of the city. She was a voodoo practitioner, called the \\"Voodoo Queen of New Orleans,\\" and she used her connections to wealthy women to support her religious practice. She provided \\"help\\" to women who needed it for money, gifts and other favors. French hairdresser Marcel Grateau developed the \\"Marcel wave\\" in the late part of the century. His wave required the use of a special hot hair iron and needed to be done by an experienced hairdresser. Fashionable women asked to have their hair \\"marceled.\\" During this period, hairdressers began opening salons in cities and towns, led by Martha Matilda Harper, who developed one of the first retail chains of hair salons, the Harper Method. A Dutch hairstylist gives a woman the \\"Coup Sixty-One\\" hairstyle. After completing the look, he then shows that his styling can withstand the elements, with a watering can demonstration. ===20th century=== Beauty salons became popularized during the 20th century, alongside men's barbershops. These spaces served as social spaces, allowing women to socialize while having their hair done and other services such as facials. Wealthy women still had hairdressers visit their home, but, the majority of women visited salons for services, including high- end salons such as Elizabeth Arden's Red Door Salon. Major advancements in hairdressing tools took place during this period. Electricity led to the development of permanent wave machines and hair dryers. These tools allowed hairdressers to promote visits to their salons, over limited service in-home visits. New coloring processes were developed, including those by Eugene Schueller in Paris, which allowed hairdressers to perform complicated styling techniques. After World War I, the bob cut and the shingle bob became popular, alongside other short haircuts. In the 1930s complicated styles came back into fashion, alongside the return of the Marcel wave. Hairdressing was one of the few acceptable professions during this time for women, alongside teaching, nursing and clerical work. ==Hairdressers today== ===United States=== Occupationally, hairdressing is expected to grow faster than the average for all other occupations, at 20%. A state license is required for hairdressers to practice, with qualifications varying from state to state. Generally a person interested in hairdressing must have a high school diploma or GED, be at least 16 years of age, and have graduated from a state-licensed barber or cosmetology school. Full-time programs often last 9 months or more, leading to an associate degree. After students graduate from a program, they take a state licensing exam, which often consists of a written test, and a practical test of styling or an oral exam. Hairdressers must pay for licenses, and occasionally licenses must be renewed. Some states allow hairdressers to work without obtaining a new license, while others require a new license. About 44% of hairdressers are self-employed, often putting in 40-hour work weeks, and even longer among the self-employed. In 2008, 29% of hairstylists worked part- time, and 14% had variable schedules. As of 2008, people working as hairdressers totaled about 630,700, with a projected increase to 757,700 by 2018. == See also == * Asymmetric cut * Hairstyle * Hollywood Makeup Artist and Hair Stylist Guild Awards ==References== Category:Personal care and service occupations Category:Fashion occupations Category:Articles containing video clips ","title":"Hairdresser"},{"id":"1283131","text":"Yugh (Yug) is a Yeniseian language, closely related to Ket, formerly spoken by the Yugh people, one of the southern groups along the Yenisei River in central Siberia.

Seventy-two percent of the faculty hold advanced degrees, and nineteen percent hold PhDs. ==History== ===Morristown School=== The Episcopal Church founded Morristown School as St. Bartholomew's School in 1891. Rev. Frank E. Edwards, a graduate of Harvard University (1891), served as the school's first headmaster, and classes took place in Morristown's Normandy Park area. St. Bartholomew's school was noted for hosting a speech by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, author of the Sherlock Holmes novels, in 1894. Three years later, St. Bartholomew's School moved its classes to Whippany Road after building a new campus near the Morristown railroad station. Designed by architects Edward Lippincott Tilton and William A. Boring (co-designers of Ellis Island's Immigrant Station), the buildings for this campus required only 90 days to construct. The blended Colonial Revival and Classical Revival architecture styles reflect the colonial history of the Morristown area. Ford Mansion in Morristown (now part of Morristown National Historical Park) served as one of George Washington's headquarters during the American Revolutionary War. When St. Bartholomew's School faced financial challenges in late 1897, three of its teachers from Harvard University Class of 1888 reorganized St. Bartholomew's School as the Morristown School. These three co-founders of Morristown School were Francis Call Woodman, Arthur Pierce Butler, and Thomas Quincy Browne. Aiding their work to start the new school, a large donation from wealthy businessman Henry Lee Higginson (known for founding the Boston Symphony Orchestra) provided critical seed funding. The school also benefited from large financial gifts of three other notable philanthropists: businessmen Charles Francis Adams III, Larz Anderson III, and Joseph Lee. Adams (a great-grandson of President John Quincy Adams) and Anderson (a son of General Nicholas Longworth Anderson) graduated from Harvard in the same class year as Morristown School's co-founders. (Lee graduated from Harvard five years earlier.) Morristown School prepared its students for Harvard University, other Ivy League schools, and engineering schools. \\" The school opened in September 1898 with 23 students and eight staff members. Just two years later, enrollment more than tripled to educate 75 students; the student body increased to 173 by 1923. In 1908, Morristown School achieved recognition as one of only two schools outside New England to send students to Harvard for ten consecutive years (1899–1908). Strengthening the connection with Harvard, Morristown School leaders hosted the Harvard Club of New Jersey. The club's April 1909 meeting brought visits from Harvard President Charles Eliot, New Jersey Governor John Fort, and New Jersey Chancellor Mahlon Pitney (later a U.S Supreme Court justice). Eleven years later, the Morristown School ran a $500,000 fundraising campaign to establish an endowment. Several Harvard graduates served on the campaign's executive committee, including graduates of Harvard and the Morristown School (writer Roger Burlingame, journalist Samuel T. Williamson, and businessman Felix Knauth). During World War I, 65 of Morristown School's first 103 graduates (63%) served in the U.S. military. Their service reflected the value of community service emphasized by Morristown School to its student body. During the war, students at the school raised funds to purchase and equip the Morristown School Ambulance. They then presented this ambulance to the American Field Service for use in France. The American Field Service awarded Morristown School a certificate and a brass plaque to show its appreciation for the ambulance. In 1913, 40 of Morristown School's students helped the Morristown Fire Department extinguish a forest fire that had spread over three miles on Horse Hill; the students used portable chemical extinguishers to fight the flames. Nine years later, the full student body (173 students) helped fight a large fire that had destroyed two nearby houses. In 1957, the basketball team donated a trophy to Delbarton School (the school rival) to honor Paul Kreutz, a Delbarton player who drowned in 1956. ===Beard School=== In 1891, sisters Lucie Beard, Eliza Mills Beard, and Ettie Beard Foster started a school for kindergarten students on Claredon Place in Orange, New Jersey. The three sisters were cousins of historian James Truslow Adams, a Pulitzer Prize winning writer. Eliza Beard oversaw the school's financial management, and Lucie Beard ran the educational activities. Their mother, Hester Truslow Beard, also assisted with the establishment of the school. The Beard school had an initial enrollment of 13 students. The all-girls school moved to Berkley Avenue in 1900 and continued adding grades until it graduated its first class in 1903. Taking the role of a preparatory country day school, Beard School prepared its students for the Seven Sisters and other colleges and universities. Earning notoriety for this purpose, the Beard School received financial support from capitalist Sidney Morse Colgate of Colgate-Palmolive. In 1928, the school hosted a speech by Rev. Harry Emerson Fosdick, a social justice activist, at its commencement ceremony. Fosdick's visit reflected Beard School's commitment to service for its student body. During World War I, the students made bandages and wound dressings and began a tradition of sewing and knitting items to donate to the American Red Cross. This tradition extended into and past the Great Depression of the 1930s. During World War II, Beard School's students worked for the Junior Red Cross and assisted the American war effort by contributing their time and money. On November 30, 1953, a large fire swept through Beard School's campus in the middle of the night. Reaching a peak of fifty feet in the air, the fire engulfed two of the school's five buildings and left them unusable. The fire destroyed an auditorium, 16 classrooms, and Beard School's gymnasium. After calling the fire department, Headmistress Edith Sutherland awakened the 20 boarding students and led them to safety on the school's front lawn. Salvaging wood from the school's ruined buildings, a machinist repairman who lived nearby built a two-story garage for his family's home. His daughter later penned an essay about her childhood that described her memories surrounding the fire. Submitting the essay to Unico National, an Italian-American service organization, she earned second place in their Ella T. Grasso literary contest. Rebuilding, Beard School launched the Beard Fund campaign in Fall 1954 to fund construction of a new building to replace the two buildings devastate by the fire. The campaign hosted a Hawaiian-themed benefit dance on October 22, 1954 to raise some of the funds. In the spring of that school year, the Beard School opened the new fireproof building for use by classes. Eleven years later, the Beard School had discussions with Short Hills Country Day School about a potential merger of the two schools. The two schools did not merge, however. Short Hills Country Day School later merged with the Pingry School in Bernards, New Jersey. ===Morristown–Beard School=== The all- boys Morristown School merged with the all-girls Beard School in 1971. The new co-ed school elected to use Morristown School's campus in Morristown and close the Beard School's campus in Orange. (The former campus of the Beard School now houses the White House Healthcare & Rehabilitation Center.) On Prize Day, June 5, 1971, the Morristown School officially transitioned into Morristown–Beard School, a name chosen to reflect the importance of the history of its predecessor schools. Recognizing their collective legacy, Morristown–Beard School adopted the Beard School's Latin motto of (\\"Ad Astra per Aspera\\") and the Morristown School's school shield. (The Morristown School had two Latin mottos: \\"Civitas\\" and \\"Orbis Aratro Pendet\\". The former means citizenship, and the latter means: \\"The world hangs in the work of the plow.\\") Morristown–Beard School also renamed its Main Building as Beard Hall. The first class of the school graduated in June 1972. Twenty-two years later, the school expanded its Middle School's student body from two grades (7-8) to three (6-8). In recent years, many notable figures have visited Morristown–Beard School to speak to students, faculty, and staff. Colonel Jack H. Jacobs, a Medal of Honor recipient, spoken on the Friday before Memorial Day weekend in 2015. Jacobs received the medal for bravery during the Vietnam War. Other notable speakers have included: businesswoman Bobbi Brown,Bobbi Brown Speaks at MBS authors Rachel Simmons and Bryan Burrough, and Congressman Rodney Frelinghuysen. ==Facilities== Supported by a $16.2 million capital campaign, Morristown–Beard School constructed the Middle School building and Founders Hall, a performing arts facility. The Middle School building opened during fall 2008, and Founders Hall, which houses a 630-seat surround-sound theatre, opened during winter 2009.\\"Morristown-Beard Unveils \\"Founders' Hall\\" at Gala\\" , Morristown–Beard School, April 27, 2009.

It was first created on June 22, 1941 from the Kiev Special Military District. The western boundary of the front in June 1941 was 865 km long, from the Pripyat River and the town of Wlodawa to the Prut River and the town of Lipkany at the border with Romania. It connected to the north with the Western Front, which extended to the Lithuanian border, and to the south with the Southern Front, which extended to the city of Odessa on the Black Sea. ==Operational history== The Southwestern Front was on the main axis of attack by the German Army Group South during Operation Barbarossa. At the outbreak of war with Germany, the Front contained the Soviet 5th, 6th, 26th, and 12th Armies along the frontier. 16th and 19th Armies were in reserve behind the forward forces. These forces took part in the tank battles in western Ukraine and were surrounded and destroyed at the Battle of Uman and the Battle of Kiev (1941) in August and September 1941. The Front was immediately re-established with new forces. During the period of the Battle of Moscow it was under the command of Marshal Timoshenko, and included from north to south the 40th, 21st, 38th and 6th Armies. It was formally disbanded on July 12, 1942 and the forces transferred to the Stalingrad Front and Southern Front. The Front was reformed from reserve armies on October 22, 1942. It was renamed the 3rd Ukrainian Front on October 20, 1943. 3rd Ukrainian Front's first operations were the Battle of the Dnieper and the Battle of Kiev (1943). ===Southwestern Front on 22 June 1941=== Composition Subordinate Front units directly under Commander of the Front:Boevoi Sostav Sovietskoi Armii czast I juni-dekabr 1941 Moskva 1966 page 9 *31st Rifle Corps :193rd Rifle Division :195th Rifle Division :200th Rifle Division *36th Rifle Corps: :140th Rifle Division :146th Rifle Division :228th Rifle Division *49th Rifle Corps :190th Rifle Division :197th Rifle Division :199th Rifle Division *55th Rifle Corps :130th Rifle Division :169th Rifle Division :189th Rifle Division *1st Airborne Corps :1st Airborne Infantry Brigade :204th Airborne Infantry Brigade :211th Airborne Infantry Brigade *Fortified Regions :1st Kiev :3rd Latichov :5th Khorosten :7th Novogrudok–Volynsk :13th Shepetovka :15th Ostropol :17th Izaslav *Front Artillery :5th Anti-Tank Brigade :205th Corps Artillery Regiment :207th Corps Artillery Regiment :368th Corps Artillery Regiment :457th Corps Artillery Regiment :458th Corps Artillery Regiment :507th Corps Artillery Regiment :543rd Corps Artillery Regiment :646th Corps Artillery Regiment :305th Cannon Artillery Regiment (RGK) :355th Cannon Artillery Regiment (RGK) :4th High Power Howitzer Regiment (RGK) :168th High Power Howitzer Regiment (RGK) :324th High Power Howitzer Regiment (RGK) :330th High Power Howitzer Regiment (RGk) :526th High Power Howitzer Regiment (RGK) :331st Howitzer Regiment (RGK) :376th Howitzer Regiment (RGK) :529th Howitzer Regiment (RGK) :538th Howitzer Regiment (RGK) :589th Howitzer Regiment (RGK) :34th Independent Special Artillery Division :245th Independent Special Artillery Division :315th Independent Special Artillery Division :316th Independent Special Artillery Division :263rd Independent Anti-Aircraft Artillery Division *Front PVO :3rd Air Defense Division :4th Air Defense Division :11th Air Defense Brigade :Air Defense Brigade Regions: ::Stanislavov ::Rovno ::Zhitomir ::Tarnopol ::Vinnitsa *Front Tank/Mechanized Troops :19th Mechanized Corps: ::40th Tank Division ::43rd Tank Division ::213th Mechanized Division ::21st Motorcycle Regiment :24th Mechanized Corps: ::45th Tank Division ::49th Tank Division ::216th Mechanized Division ::17th Motorcycle Regiment :1st Independent Armoured Car Division *Front Air Forces :44th Fighter Aviation Division :64th Fighter Aviation Division :19th Bomber Aviation Division :62nd Bomber Aviation Division :14th Mixed Aviation Division :15th Mixed Aviation Division :16th Mixed Aviation Division :17th Mixed Aviation Division :63rd Mixed Aviation Division :36th Fighter Aviation Division (PVO) :315th Air Reconnaissance Regiment :316th Air Reconnaissance Regiment *Front Engineer Troops :45th Engineer Regiment :1st Pontoon Bridge Regiment ==Commanders== * Colonel General Mikhail P.

It is situated in the comarca of el Baix Llobregat. Esparreguera is famous in Catalonia for staging a grand version of the play Life and Passion of Jesus Christ every year in March and April, on the Sundays before and after Easter. The play is popularly known as La Passió d'Esparreguera. Over 300 actors, 50 technicians and 100 musicians participate in the play during five acts, twenty scenographic settings and more than five hours of drama, from the election of the apostles until the resurrection of Jesus. The grand scale of the show is achieved with the volunteer contribution of the citizens of the town, in a tradition that dates back to Esparreguera's medieval origins. This tradition has made Esparreguera one of the cradles of Catalan performing arts, giving birth to actors such as the sisters Anna and Lola Lizaran, or the contemporary dancer Ramon Oller. The Shakira's music video for Empire was filmed in Esparreguera too. ==References== ==External links== * Government data pages Category:Municipalities in Baix Llobregat ","title":"Esparreguera"},{"id":"1283194","text":"\\"The Augments\\" is the sixth episode of the fourth season of the American science fiction television series Star Trek: Enterprise, the eighty-second episode overall. It is the last of a three-story episode arc, preceded by \\"Borderland\\", and \\"Cold Station 12\\". \\"The Augments\\" was directed by LeVar Burton, from a script by Michael Sussman. The series follows the adventures of the first Starfleet starship Enterprise, registration NX-01. In this episode, \\"Augments\\", genetically enhanced humans, and Doctor Arik Soong, their surrogate father, escape Cold Station 12 after stealing frozen Augment embryos from storage. Soong plans to hide out with the Augments and raise the embryos, but Malik, their leader, is tired of hiding and attempts to instigate a war between Starfleet and the Klingons. The production of the episode reunites fellow Star Trek: The Next Generation alumni Burton as the director and Brent Spiner as Arik Soong. On The Next Generation, Burton previously played Geordi La Forge, while Spiner played Data. Most of the guest cast from the previous two Enterprise episodes in the story arc returned for \\"The Augments\\"; Mark Rolston makes an appearance as Klingon Captain Magh. The sets were also reused, but a new one was built for the Klingon escape pod used by Soong. UPN first aired \\"The Augments\\" on November 12, 2004, where it was watched by 2.1 percent of the U.S. population. It received mixed reviews by critics, who spoke negatively of Malik's character, but praised the performance of Spiner as Soong and the relationship between T'Pol and Tucker. ==Plot== At the end of \\"Cold Station 12\\", Doctor Arik Soong and the Augments he secretly raised depart the space station, taking with them 1,800 frozen Augment embryos preserved from the time of the Eugenics Wars. Before leaving, Malik steals several pathogen samples from the station and sets the containment fields to fail. In \\"The Augments\\", Captain Archer restores stasis around the central compound, and is beamed from space to safety, with the Enterprise in pursuit of Soong, Malik, and the Augments on their stolen Bird of Prey. Soong and the Augments arrive in Klingon space where he shares his plan: Soong intends to hide out in a region (the Briar Patch) where Starfleet would have trouble tracking them down. Malik objects to Soong's plan, noting that Khan Noonien Singh also ran away on the SS Botany Bay. In pursuit of the Augments, Enterprise arrives in Klingon space having faked a Klingon warp signature. Soong releases a hostage on a Denobulan shuttle into a gas giant, forcing the Enterprise to abandon their pursuit and mount a rescue operation. Escaping, Malik proposes a new plan: trigger a war between Starfleet and the Klingons as a distraction by firing a pathogen-filled torpedo at a Klingon colony. He reasons that Starfleet will be too busy fighting the Klingons to hunt down the Augments. Soong will have nothing to do with Malik's genocidal proposal. On the Enterprise, Commander T'Pol asks Commander Tucker about the distance between them after her recent arranged marriage (\\"Home\\"), and he tells her he has come to terms with their new relationship. Back on the Bird of Prey, Soong works on a way to remove aggressive behavior from the unborn Augment embryos. Malik, concerned by Soong's plan to hide from Starfleet and his tampering with the embryos, leads a mutiny which confines Soong to his quarters. With the help of Persis, Soong leaves the ship in an escape pod. Enterprise, once again in pursuit, detects the pod and brings Soong on board. Heading towards the Klingon colony in high warp in an attempt to stop Malik's plan, the Klingons detect their ship. Enterprise is forced to disable a Klingon cruiser when it tries to board. Malik kills Persis for her betrayal, and continues with his plan to attack the Klingons. Scans of the Qu'vat colony reveal three main population centers; the torpedo is armed with pathogens and prepared for deployment. The Enterprise arrives late, just after Malik fires the torpedo, but Enterprise destroys it, saving the Klingon colony. Soong helps disable the Klingon ship, hoping to save some of the Augments. However, Malik scuttles the Klingon ship, killing the remaining Augments and the embryos, and transports himself onto Enterprise in an attempt to kill Soong in revenge, but Archer manages to kill Malik first. The Klingons call off their retaliation against Earth, and Soong returns to the Starfleet Detention Center. In custody, he begins to doubt the feasibility of genetically engineering humans and wonders if perfecting artificial life has better prospects for the future. ==Production== From left; Brent Spiner, William Shatner and LeVar Burton \\"The Augments\\" is the final episode in a three-part story which began with \\"Borderland\\" and continued in \\"Cold Station 12\\". The return of genetically enhanced humans , as previously seen in the Star Trek: The Original Series episode \\"Space Seed\\" and Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan, closely ties Enterprise to The Original Series. The episode reunites Brent Spiner and LeVar Burton, two former Star Trek: The Next Generation alumni. Spiner previously played the role of the android Data on the show while Burton played chief engineer Geordi La Forge. Spiner appeared in all previous installments of the three-story arc, while Burton only directed \\"The Augments\\". Burton previously directed three episodes of Enterprise in the third season. To celebrate their collaboration as well as acknowledge the crew members who had remained with the franchise since their former series, Burton bought lunch on the final day of shooting for everyone on the set. The episode was written by Mike Sussman, his second of the season after \\"Home\\". Shooting began on September 2 and lasted for seven days, with the production taking time off for Labor Day. The majority of the sets on the episode were created for \\"Borderland\\" or \\"Cold Station 12\\". The scene depicting a Klingon escape pod required the construction of a new set. Spiner, as well as several other guest stars, resumed their roles from earlier in the story arc, including Alec Newman as Malik, Richard Riehle as Doctor Jeremy Lucas, Abby Brammell as Persis and Adam Grimes as Lokesh. Joining them was Mark Rolston as the Klingon Captain Magh; Rolston previously appeared in The Next Generation as Walter Pierce in the episode \\"Eye of the Beholder\\", and also played Kuroda in the Enterprise episode \\"Canamar\\". ==Reception and home media release== UPN first broadcast \\"The Augments\\" on November 12, 2004. According to overnight Nielsen ratings, 2.1 percent of the population of the United States and four percent of those watching television at the time viewed the episode. \\"The Augments\\" received the same ratings as the previous episode, \\"Cold Station 12\\". However, it moved up to fourth place in the 8 p.m. timeslot, narrowly beating What I Like About You and Grounded for Life on The WB. In a review for TrekNation, Michelle Erica Green said that Malik had become a \\"cardboard villain\\" by the time of \\"The Augments\\", but she did not place the blame on Alec Newman for the failing. She also criticised the use of Persis' death by Malik, saying that he defined her \\"even in death as a commodity for his use\\". Green praised the relationship between T'Pol and Tucker and the characterisation of Soong, noting that Spiner's performance was the best of the three-episode arc. Writing for Jammer's Reviews, Jamahl Epsicokhan gave the episode a rating of two out of four. Like Green, he also criticised Malik, noting that the \\"crux of the story is reduced to an unremarkable three-character power struggle that is supposed to be a microcosm for the trouble that comes with genetically engineered super-humans, but comes across instead as overly bland and tidy drama.\\" Spiner \\"delivers a good performance under the circumstances\\", notes Epsicokhan, as his character has to believe that Malik will not overthrow his leadership of the Augments. Summing up the episode, Epsicokhan writes: > Perhaps this story was simply content to show absolute power corrupting > absolutely. Unfortunately, aside from Persis, none of the Augments stop to > think about what they're doing or why, and the story of Malik is content to > blandly repeat the story of Khan, but without the crucial personal motivator > of revenge. I think the writers owed the material more than this. Den of Geek writer James Hunt ranked the mini-arc featuring the episodes \\"Borderland\\", \\"Cold Station 12\\" and \\"The Augments\\", the sixth best story of Enterprise. In a review for Big Shiny Robot, Andy Wilson said that the story arc represented the \\"personal journey\\" of Arik Soong from genetic engineering to cybernetics. In 2018, Screen Rant praised casting Brent Spinner as the character Arik Soong. A home media release of \\"The Augments\\" was originally released in the United States on November 1, 2005, as part of the season four DVD box set of Enterprise. The Blu-ray edition was released on April 1, 2014. ==See also== *Genetic engineering in science fiction ==Notes== ==References== ==External links== * Category:Star Trek: Enterprise (season 4) episodes Category:2004 American television episodes Category:Television episodes about eugenics ","title":"The Augments"},{"id":"1283217","text":"Blanchard is a French family name.

Medford, N.J.: Information Today, 2000. He helped to create Current Contents, Science Citation Index (SCI), Journal Citation Reports, and Index Chemicus, among others, and founded the magazine The Scientist. The concept of the Science Citation Index is first articulated. ==Early life and education== Garfield was born in 1925 in New York City as Eugene Eli Garfinkle, and was raised in a Lithuanian-Italian Jewish family. His parents were second generation immigrants living in East Bronx in New York City. He studied at the University of Colorado and University of California, Berkeley before getting a Bachelor of Science degree in chemistry from Columbia University in 1949. Garfield also received a degree in Library Science from Columbia University in 1953 He went on to do his PhD in the Department of Linguistics at the University of Pennsylvania, which he completed in 1961 for developing an algorithm for translating chemical nomenclature into chemical formulas. ==Career and research== Working as a laboratory assistant at Columbia University after his graduation, Garfield indexed all previously synthesized compounds so that not to remake them, which helped him understand that his inclination to information towards science was bigger than towards chemistry. In 1951, he got a position at the Welch Medical Library at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland, where most of the National Library of Medicine information systems were developed. There he built search and cataloging system methods using punch-cards. In 1953, at the First Symposium on Machine Methods in Scientific Documentation, Garfield got introduced to Shepard's Citations. In 1956, Garfield founded the Institute for Scientific Information (ISI), which was located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. ISI formed a major part of the science division of Thomson Reuters. In October 2016 Thomson Reuters completed the sale of its intellectual property and science division; it is now known as Clarivate Analytics. Garfield was responsible for many innovative bibliographic products, including Current Contents, the Science Citation Index (SCI), and other citation databases, the Journal Citation Reports, and Index Chemicus. He was the founding editor and publisher of The Scientist, a news magazine for life scientists. In 2003, the University of South Florida School of Information was honored to have him as lecturer for the Alice G. Smith Lecture. In 2007, he launched HistCite, a bibliometric analysis and visualization software package. Following ideas inspired by Vannevar Bush's highly cited 1945 article As We May Think, Garfield undertook the development of a comprehensive citation index showing the propagation of scientific thinking; he started the Institute for Scientific Information in 1956 (it was sold to the Thomson Corporation in 1992). According to Garfield, \\"the citation index ... may help a historian to measure the influence of an article — that is, its 'impact factor'\\". The creation of the Science Citation Index made it possible to calculate impact factor, which ostensibly measures the importance of scientific journals. It led to the unexpected discovery that a few journals like Nature and Science were core for all of hard science. The same pattern does not happen with the humanities or the social sciences. His entrepreneurial flair in having turned what was, at least at the time, an obscure and specialist metric into a highly profitable business has been noted. Garfield's work led to the development of several information retrieval algorithms, like the HITS algorithm and PageRank. Both use the structured citation between websites through hyperlinks. Google co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin acknowledged Gene in their development of PageRank, the algorithm that powers their company's search engine. Garfield published over 1,000 essays. ==Honors and awards== Garfield was awarded the John Price Wetherill Medal in 1984 and Derek de Solla Price Memorial Medal in 1984 . He was also awarded the Richard J. Bolte Sr. Award in 2007. The Association for Library and Information Science Education has a fund for doctoral research through an award named after Garfield. ==Criticism== Writing in Physiology News, No. 69, Winter 2007, David Colquhoun of the Department of Pharmacology, University College London, described the \\"impact factor,\\" a method for comparing scholarly journals, as \\"the invention of Eugene Garfield, a man who has done enormous harm to true science.\\" Colquhoun ridiculed C. Hoeffel's assertion that Garfield's impact factor \\"has the advantage of already being in existence and is therefore a good technique for scientific evaluation\\" by saying, \\"you can't get much dumber than that. It is a 'good technique' because it is already in existence? There is something better. Read the papers.\\" ==Personal life== Garfield is survived by a wife, three sons, a daughter, a step-daughter, two granddaughters, and two great-grandchildren. ==ReferencesCategory:1925 births Category:American people of Lithuanian-Jewish descent Category:Bibliometrics Category:2017 deaths ","title":"Eugene Garfield"},{"id":"1283250","text":"Line C of the Buenos Aires Underground, that runs from Retiro to Constitución terminus, opened on 9 November 1934, and it has a length of . It runs under such streets as Lima Sur, Bernardo de Irigoyen, Carlos Pellegrini, Esmeralda, la Plaza San Martín and Avenida Ramos Mejia. It not only connects to every other line on the system (with the exception of Line H, which will be connected at a later date), but its termini at Retiro and Constitución also connect it to some of the most important commuter rail networks in Buenos Aires, such as the Mitre and Roca lines and also long distance passenger services. It is thus an important artery in Buenos Aires' transport system. At the same time, it is also the shortest line in both terms of length and number of stations. It was the third line of the network to provide service to the public, after Line A and Line B. Up until 2007 with the opening of line H, it was the only line in the system providing a North-South service. 300px ==History== The line was constructed by the Compañía Hispano Argentina de Obras Públicas y Finanzas (CHADOPyF, Hispanic-Argentine Company for Public Works and Finances), headed by a Spanish nobleman, the Count of Guadalhorce after the Great Depression of the 1930s had meant the Anglo-Argentine Tramways Company (which owned most of the then-vast tram network in the city) pulled out of its construction.La línea C cumple 80 años – Diario de Cultura. The line was subsequently opened in 1934 and extended from the present terminus at Constitución to Diagonal Norte in the centre of the city. The stretch from Diagonal Norte to its present terminus at Retiro was then opened in 1936 and marked the last expansion of the line, which remains the only line not to be extended since then. On opening, the stations were decorated with murals depicting rural Spain created by Argentine artists Martín S. Noel and Manuel Escasani,Línea C – Buenos Aires Ciduad as well as some stations taking Moorish influences and were painted with gold powder. It had advanced technology for the time, such as Automatic Train Stop (ATS). When Line E was opened in 1938, its original terminus was shared with that of Line C at Constitución, however the route of Line E was altered in 1966 for the lines to meet instead at Independencia, where they still do so to this day.Línea E: 70 años buscando pasajeros – EnElSubte, June 2014 With the current extension of Line E and Line H, they will both meet Line C at Retiro, where all three will terminate. Siemens are currently modernising the signalling systems on the line, at a cost of $18 million which includes the use of Communications-based train control (CBTC) in order to improve the line's frequency and potentially open up the possibility of automatic trains in the future. The work is expected to be completed towards the end of 2016.Siemens modernizará las señales de la línea C – EnElSubte, 1 October 2014. Aside from the signalling system, the line will is also having its stations refurbished, its rolling stock refurbished and ventilation improved, in part to compensate from the extra heat associated with the air conditioning units added to the trains. Major works are also under way at Constitución railway station to provide better transfers between the Roca Line, Line C and Metrobus Sur in the area, which includes the construction of a new underground annex to the station. Large segments of track, as well as switches, are also being replaced.Grandes obras del subte que no percibís a simple vista – Buenos Aires Ciudad, 18 September 2015. ==Rolling stock== Interior of the Nagoya 300 Series rolling stock The Count of Guadalhorce, who oversaw the construction of the line. When the line was first opened, it was served by Siemens-Schuckert Orenstein & Koppel rolling stock in its entirety until 2007. In 1999, trains were purchased from the Nagoya Municipal Subway but they ultimately ended up serving Line D, and were then sent to Line C in 2007 as Line D acquired more new Alstom rolling stock and Line H was opened, meaning that the Siemens O&K; trains were needed there as temporary stock until newer Alstom Metropolis trains arrived there.Ferrofilatelia – EnElSubte, 6 June 2010.Así son los nuevos trenes Alstom para la línea H – EnElSubte, 25 March 2015.

The D Line opened on 3 June 1937 and has been expanded to the north several times. The line is currently 11 km long and has 16 stations, while running approximately parallel to the city's coastline. 300px ==History== Line G Line D was the second line to be built by the Compañía Hispano Argentina de Obras Públicas y Finanzas (CHADOPyF, Hispanic-Argentine Company for Public Works and Finances), following the construction of Line C in 1934. Construction began in 1935 and the first part of the line was inaugurated in 1937 and ran 1.7 km from Catedral (still the current terminus) to Tribunales. Three years later, the section which brought the line to Plaza Italia in Palermo was completed, bringing the length of the line to 6.5 km. The line was not properly extended until 1993 when it was extended to Ministro Caranza, a station named after the Radical politician. Further extensions occurred in the 1990s, beginning in 1997 with the opening of Olleros and José Hernández, then Juramento in 1999, and finally Congreso de Tucumán in 2000, where it currently terminates.Linea D – Ciudad de Buenos Aires Over the decades it has been discussed numerous times whether to extend the line out to the limits of the city proper. The last of these proposals came forward in 2002 which would have seen an additional two stations added to the line. However, this was later abandoned since the line was already at full capacity after the opening of Congreso de Tucumán station.¿Por qué la línea D no llega hasta Puente Saavedra? – EnElSubte, 25 June 2013. In June 2015 the Metrobus Cabildo line opened, connecting Line D from its terminus at Congreso de Tucumán to Vicente López district in Greater Buenos Aires, some kilometres away from the city limits, essentially making the extension of Line D redundant.Inaugurarían en junio el Metrobús Cabildo – EnElSubte, 6 May 2015. Line D is the only line in the network which will not be extended as part of the most recent expansion plan. Until the privatisation of the underground in the 1990s, Line D was identified by the red colour; whilst Line B used green. ==Museum Stations== Olleros station platforms. Line D carries out cultural activities on stations Juramento, Congreso de Tucumán and Olleros. These stations can be visited in order to appreciate the expositions and stands destined to rotary exhibitions coming from the City’s Museums, as well as the Nation’s, educative institutions and other civil society organizations. “The objective of the museum-stations is to get the population acquainted with the huge cultural and historical patrimony that the City owns, thus turning the subway network, a massive transport medium, into an ideal diffusion agent. The lending of the facilities is absolutely free for the museum and institutions that wish to exhibit their activities or part of the historical or cultural patrimony they treasure”.Quote > Subterráneos de Buenos Aires (English) ==Rolling stock== Buenos Aires Underground 100 Series rolling stock Line D was originally served by Siemens-Schuckert Orenstein & Koppel rolling stock, and then by CAF cars. In 1999, cars from the Nagoya Municipal Subway were purchased second hand from Japan and incorporated into the line. In 2001, numerous Alstom Metropolis 100 Series cars were purchased and built in Brazil and Argentina with the intention of incorporating them into Line A, however they were ultimately put in service on Line D where they remain to this day. More 100 Series cars continued to be purchased in that decade up until 2009, making a total of 96 cars.Finalizó la entrega de los Alstom Metrópolis – EnElSubte, 9 March 2009. The remaining Nagoya cars were moved to Line C in 2007 and replaced with the 100 Series cars and with Fiat-Materfer cars. To make the rolling stock more uniform, 24 more modern 300 Series Alstom Metropolis cars were ordered in 2013 to replace the Materfer cars on the line, meaning that the line would be entirely composed of 120 Alstom cars.SBASE anuncia nuevos coches con foto del Metro de San Pablo – EnElSubte, 21 January 2014.

Trying the door, she found the metal doorknob to be uncomfortably warm to the touch and called the police. Reeser's remains, which were largely ashes, were found among the remains of a chair in which she had been sitting. Only part of her left foot (which was wearing a slipper) and her backbone remained, along with her skull. Plastic household objects at a distance from the seat of the fire were softened and had lost their shapes. Reeser's skull had survived and was found among the ashes, but shrunken (sometimes with the added descriptive flourish of 'to the size of a teacup'). The extent of this shrinkage was enough to be remarked on by official investigators and was not an illusion caused by the removal of all facial features (ears, nose, lips, etc.). The shrinking of the skull is not a regular feature of alleged cases of SHC, although the 'shrunken skull' claim has become a regular feature of anecdotal accounts of other SHC cases and numerous apocryphal stories. On July 7, 1951, St. Petersburg police chief J.R. Reichert sent a box of evidence from the scene to FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover. He included glass fragments found in the ashes, six \\"small objects thought to be teeth,\\" a section of the carpet, and the surviving shoe. Even though the body was almost totally cremated, requiring very high temperatures, the room in which it occurred showed little evidence of the fire. Reichert included a note saying: \\"We request any information or theories that could explain how a human body could be so destroyed and the fire confined to such a small area and so little damage done to the structure of the building and the furniture in the room not even scorched or damaged by smoke.\\" The FBI eventually declared that Reeser had been incinerated by the wick effect. As she was a known user of sleeping pills, they hypothesized that she had fallen unconscious while smoking and set fire to her nightclothes. \\"Once the body starts to burn,\\" the FBI wrote in its report, \\"there is enough fat and other inflammable substances to permit varying amounts of destruction to take place. Sometimes this destruction by burning will proceed to a degree which results in almost complete combustion of the body.\\" At the request of the Chief of Police, St. Petersburg, Florida, the scene was also investigated by physical anthropologist Wilton M. Krogman. Professor Krogman, of the University of Pennsylvania's School of Medicine, had spent some time in the 1930s experimenting and examining the remains of such incidents, in order to aid in the detection of crimes. Krogman was frequently consulted by the FBI for this reason but after examining the scene and reading the FBI's report, he strongly disputed the FBI's conclusions concerning Reeser. However, the full circumstances of the death—and Krogman's objections to the FBI's version of events—would not become known publicly for a decade. ==Quotations== In a 1961 article for The General Magazine and History Chronicle of the University of Pennsylvania, Krogman wrote extensively about the Reeser case. His remarks included: > I find it hard to believe that a human body, once ignited, will literally > consume itself -- burn itself out, as does a candle wick, guttering in the > last residual pool of melted wax [...] Just what did happen on the night of > July 1, 1951, in St. Petersburg, Florida? We may never know, though this > case still haunts me.The General Magazine and History Chronicle of the > University of Pennsylvania With regard to Reeser's shrunken skull, Krogman wrote: > [...]The head is not left complete in ordinary burning cases. Certainly it > does not shrivel or symmetrically reduce to a smaller size. In presence of > heat sufficient to destroy soft tissues, the skull would literally explode > in many pieces. I have never known any exception to this rule. Krogman concluded: > I cannot conceive of such complete cremation without more burning of the > apartment itself. In fact the apartment and everything in it should have > been consumed. [...] I regard it as the most amazing thing I have ever seen. > As I review it, the short hairs on my neck bristle with vague fear. Were I > living in the Middle Ages, I'd mutter something about black magic. Later, having put this statement on the record, Krogman moved away from this position. He instead put forward the theory that Reeser had been murdered at another location. Her murderer had access to crematorium-type equipment and had incinerated her body. The hypothetical murderer had then transported the results of the partial cremation back to the apartment and used portable heat- generating equipment to add the finishing touches, such as the heat-buckled plastic objects and the warm doorknob. ==Biographical details== Mary Reeser was born in Columbia, Pennsylvania and married Dr. Richard Reeser (b 1874/5).

It was designed to measure solar x-ray and Lyman-alpha flux, trapped energetic particles, and heavy primary cosmic rays. Secondary objectives included collecting data on micrometeoroid penetration, molecular sputtering and studying the Earth-atmosphere heat balance. Cutaway of Explorer 7 Launch was originally scheduled for late September 1959, but the mission was delayed for a week after a Jupiter IRBM test on an adjacent pad failed shortly after liftoff, causing flying debris to hit Explorer 7's launch vehicle. However, the damage to the booster was minor and could be easily repaired. Significantly, it also carried Verner Suomi's flat-plate radiometer, improved with the help of Robert Parent, that took the first Earth radiation budget measurements from space and initiated the era of satellite studies of the climate. It made the first coarse maps of \\"the solar radiation reflected by the Earth and the infrared radiation emitted by the Earth\\". Using both satellite observations of the Earth's heat balance and atmospheric cooling rates measured by net flux radiosondes, Suomi established the important role played by clouds in absorbing radiated solar energy. These observations established that Earth's energy budget varies markedly due to the effect of clouds, the surface albedo, and other absorbing constituents. Using these instruments, Suomi and his team discovered that the Earth absorbed more of the Sun's energy than originally thought and demonstrated that it was possible to measure and quantify seasonal changes in the global heat budget. Explorer 7 was unable to detect solar x-rays due to its sensors being saturated by background radiation in the Van Allen Belts. The satellite weighed 41.5 kg, was 75 cm high and 75 cm wide. Powered by solar cells, it also carried 15 nickel-cadmium batteries around its equator. It transmitted data continuously through to February 1961 and went dead on August 24, 1961.

The metadata is stored in UML models with a special ISO 20022 UML Profile. Underlying all of this is the ISO 20022 metamodel - a model of the models. The UML profile is the metamodel transformed into UML. The metadata is transformed into the syntax of messages used in financial networks. The first syntax supported for messages was XML Schema. ISO 20022 is widely used in financial services. Organizations participating in ISO 20022 include: Ripple, FIX Protocol Limited (Financial Information eXchange), ISDA (FpML), ISITC, Omgeo, SWIFT, and Visa. ISO 20022 is the successor to ISO 15022; originally ISO 20022 was called ISO 15022 2nd Edition. ISO 15022 was the successor of ISO 7775. == Parts of the standard == *ISO 20022 Financial services – Universal financial industry message scheme **ISO 20022-1:2013 Part 1: Metamodel **ISO 20022-2:2013 Part 2: UML profile **ISO 20022-3:2013 Part 3: Modelling **ISO 20022-4:2013 Part 4: XML Schema generation **ISO 20022-5:2013 Part 5: Reverse engineering **ISO 20022-6:2013 Part 6: Message transport characteristics **ISO 20022-7:2013 Part 7: Registration **ISO 20022-8:2013 Part 8: ASN.1 generation == Management of the standard == * The Standard is issued by ISO Technical Committee 68 (TC68), which is responsible for Financial Services in ISO. * The Standard is managed by Working Group 4 (WG4), a sub-group of TC68 whose charter is \\"the management of ISO 20022\\". * The Standard defines a Repository Management Group (RMG) Composed of senior industry experts.

Opened in 1944, the Line E was the last completely new line to be added to the Buenos Aires Underground, until 2007 when Line H was opened. The line has a history of being re-routed and extended due to having been historically the line with the lowest passenger numbers on the network. ==History== Line E was opened on 20 June 1944, after construction began in 1938, with an original course that ran from Constitución railway station to General Urquiza. Soon after, it was decided to abandon the terminus at Constitución (which also served as the connection with Line C) and instead reroute the line towards the Plaza de Mayo. Work began in 1957, and in 1966 the San José, Independencia, Belgrano and Plaza de Mayo (now Bolívar) stations were opened to the public by president Arturo Umberto Illia. For many years, the two stations closed during the re-route remained unused until the mid 1990s when one was converted into a workshop to service the rolling stock of the line.Línea E: 70 años buscando pasajeros – EnElSubte, June 2014 The line was further extended in 1973 to José María Moreno and then again in 1985 to Plaza de los Virreyes.Línea E – Buenos Aires Ciudad. The PreMetro E2 tramway was completed in 1987 and was linked to Line E with the intention of connecting a larger Premetro network to the line, though this never materialised following privatisation.Premetro a Puente de la Noria, en el olvido por el Metrobus del Sur – EnElSubte, August 2013 Under the private operation of the Subte by Metrovías, the colour of the line was changed from yellow to purple during the 1990s. Purple had previously been used for Line C, while yellow is now used for Line H. ===Extension to Retiro=== More recently, as part of a general effort to extend the Buenos Aires Underground, it was decided to extend Line E from Bolívar to Retiro railway station (with intermediate stations at Catalinas and Correo Central) where it would re-connect with Line C and the Mitre Line, and eventually Line H when its extension is complete. As of 2014, all major structural works have been completed on the three new stations and are only missing their tracks and signalling systems.Reporte de obra: extensión línea E – EnElSubte, May 2014 In July 2015, the City of Buenos Aires confirmed that, despite the advanced state of the works, the extension would not be opened until 2019 citing delays that came about as a result of the transfer of the works from the National Government to the City Government in 2012. The city will complete the additional work required in this time, and the extension is expected to increase ridership on the line by 25%.Ciudad confirma que la extensión de la línea E abrirá recién en 2017 – EnElSubte, 23 July 2015.

In 2006, 64 of the CAF-GEE cars were to be refurbished, but this was ultimately abandoned. It is expected that once the line's extension to Retiro is completed in 2017, the CAF GEE rolling stock will be retired and replaced by Fiat-Materfer cars, and possibly 50 Siemens O&K; cars reformed by the Emepa Group and Alstom.Metrovías oficializa quita de formaciones – EnElSubte, 4 June 2013.Subtes: el gobierno porteño planea renovar la mitad de la flota para el 2015 – InfoBAE, 23 January 2013 ==Ghost stations== There are two ghost stations on the line – San José vieja and Constitución. These formed part of the line's original trajectory towards Constitución railway station until the line was re-routed in 1966. Both stations have been used as workshops and storage areas for the line's rolling stock. It has also been evaluated using the two stations and their corresponding tunnels as the southern part of Line F since that line's projected trajectory in that area overlaps the former route Line E took.Realizarán estudios en Constitución para ubicar la cabecera de la línea F – 1 August 2011 San José vieja was used as a set for the 1996 Argentine film Moebius and served as the fictional Dock Sud and Parque stations.Murales alusivos a Moebius en San José – EnElSubte, 18 December 2014. ==Gallery== File:Inauguración provisoria Boedo.jpgTemporary Boedo station being opened (1944) File:Buenos Aires - Subte - Combinación en Constitución.jpgPassengers changing to Line C at the former Constitución station (c.1950s) File:Saguier-3.jpgEntrance to Plaza de los Virreyes station at the Premetro's Intendente Saguier terminal.

After a failed attempt at financing and building the line in 2009, its most recent proposal was put forward in 2015 by the government of Buenos Aires. ==History== The original plan proposed by CHADOPyF includes large parts of what today is known as Line G. The history of Line G dates back to 1930 when the Hispano-Argentine Company for Public Works and Finances (CHADOPyF) was tasked with expanding the network following the construction of Line A by the Anglo-Argentine Tramways Company. The company had been tasked with building four new lines, with Line 3 running from Plaza de Mayo to the intersections of San Martín and Gaona Avenues, the current location of the Sid Campeador monument, which would be built in 1935. By 1932, the original plans had been revised twice and the number of projected lines was reduced to three, with parts of lines 3 and 4 being merged into a new Line 3 (today known as Line D), and the western section of Line 3 being left on the drawing board, later to re-emerge as the planned Line G. ===Law 670=== On 8 November 2001, the government of the City of Buenos Aires established a law outlining the future expansion of the Underground network, which included three new lines; F, G and I, as well measures for the advancement of Line H. Line G would start at Retiro Mitre railway station and then head west, terminating at the Cid Campeador monument, near Parque Centenario in the Caballito neighborhood. The line, which was to stretch 7.3km and have 11 station, was then planned as follows: In December 2009, the City of Buenos Aires had made significant advances in negotiating financing and construction equipment from Exim Bank of China and China Railway Group Limited (CREC). The construction of the line was to be done with tunnel boring machines, allowing for the tunnel to advance an average of 15 metres per day and CREC would be in charge of all aspects of construction and sourcing of materials as well as rolling stock. By early 2011, it was announced that the government had obtained financing for $1.4 billion for the line and was to begin construction in 2012, concluding in 2016. The line was now to be 12.5km long and terminate further west at Villa del Parque, continuing on from the Sid Campeador terminus envisioned in Law 670. Once the project had reached the Buenos Aires City Legislature, many aspects of the deal were questioned, including the cost of the line which was estimated to be significantly cheaper ($1 billion) if built directly by the city. Following these setbacks, later that year construction was postponed indefinitely. ===PETERS Plan=== In 2015 plans for the Underground published by the Buenos Aires, the line was re- designed completely, running through the financial district of the city in between Line F and Line C before running westwards towards Palermo, proximately parallel to and just north of Line D. Construction on the line was to begin sometime after construction begins on Line F. ==References== == External links == * Subterráneos de Buenos Aires (Official Page) New Lines * Buenos Aires Ciudad (Official Government Page) Nuevas Líneas: F, G and I (Spanish) * Current system map Category:Buenos Aires Underground Category:Proposed railway lines in Argentina ","title":"Line G (Buenos Aires Underground)"},{"id":"1283339","text":"Jane Margaret O'Brien is a professor of chemistry and president emerita of St. Mary's College of Maryland.

The left and right external jugular veins drain into the subclavian veins. The internal jugular veins join with the subclavian veins more medially to form the brachiocephalic veins. Finally, the left and right brachiocephalic veins join to form the superior vena cava, which delivers deoxygenated blood to the right atrium of the heart. ===Internal=== The internal jugular vein is formed by the anastomosis of blood from the sigmoid sinus of the dura mater and the common facial vein. The internal jugular runs with the common carotid artery and vagus nerve inside the carotid sheath. It provides venous drainage for the contents of the skull. ===External=== The external jugular vein runs superficially to sternocleidomastoid. There is also another minor jugular vein, the anterior jugular vein, draining the submaxillary region. ==Clinical significance== ===Pressure=== The Jugular Venous Pressure Waveform The jugular venous pressure is an indirectly observed pressure over the venous system. It can be useful in the differentiation of different forms of heart and lung disease. In the jugular veins pressure waveform, upward deflections correspond with (A) atrial contraction, (C) ventricular contraction (and resulting bulging of perspicuous into the right atrium during isovolumic systole), and (V) atrial venous filling. The downward deflections correspond with (X) the atrium relaxing (and the perspicuous valve moving downward) and (y) the filling of ventricle after the tricuspid opens. Components include: * The a peak is caused by the contraction of the right atrium. * The av minimum is due to relaxation of the right atrium and closure of the tricuspid valve. * The c peak reflects the pressure rise in the right ventricle early during systole and the resultant bulging of the tricuspid valve—which has just closed—into the right atrium. * The x minimum occurs as the ventricle contracts and shortens during the ejection phase, later in systole. The shortening heart—with tricuspid valve still closed—pulls on valve opens, the v peak begins to wane. * The y minimum reflects a fall in right atrial pressure during rapid ventricular filling, as blood leaves the right atrium through an open tricuspid valve and enters the right ventricle. The increase in venous pressure after the y minimum occurs as venous return continues in the face of reduced ventricular filling. ==Society and culture== ===Idiom=== The jugular vein is the subject of a popular idiom in the English language, deriving from its status as the vein most vulnerable to attack. The phrase 'to go for the jugular', means to attack decisively at the weakest point - in other words, to attack at the opportune juncture for a definitive resolution, or coup-de- grace. An alternate explanation for the phrase suggests \\"to go for the jugular\\" merely means to attack without restraint. The jugular vein system is essential but not particularly weak or vulnerable, because this venous system is generally found fairly deep in the body. ==See also== *Chronic cerebrospinal venous insufficiency ==References== Category:Veins of the head and neck ","title":"Jugular vein"},{"id":"1283379","text":"The Thiotrichales are an order of Proteobacteria, including Thiomargarita namibiensis, the largest known bacterium.George M.

He was drafted by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers 15th overall in the 2004 NFL draft. He played college football at LSU. ==Early years== Clayton prepped at Christian Life Academy in Baton Rouge where he was one of the most sought after recruits in the nation his senior year. He played in the first ever U.S. Army All-American Bowl on December 30, 2000 alongside fellow LSU teammates Ben Wilkerson, Andrew Whitworth, and Marcus Spears.U.S. Army All-American Bowl All-Time Team: Offense Michael also played basketball there. In 2008, he became the first inductee in the Christian Life Academy Hall of Fame.Clayton to be inducted in CLA hall ==College career== Clayton played college football at LSU where he was part of the NCAA champion LSU Tigers. During his three years with LSU, he caught 182 passes for 2,582 yards and 21 TDs for the Tigers, and ended his LSU career with the record for career TD receptions with 21. The record was later broken by Dwayne Bowe in a game against Tennessee on November 4, 2006. He finished second in school history in receptions with 182, just one shy of tying Wendell Davis's record of 183. He is ranked fourth in career receiving yards with 2,582 and seventh in career 100-yard games, and is the only player in LSU history to have at least 700 yards receiving in three straight seasons. Clayton is a member of Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity. Clayton was initiated into the Nu Psi Chapter of Alpha Phi Alpha in the Spring of 2003. ==Professional career== ===Tampa Bay Buccaneers=== Clayton was drafted by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers with the 15th selection of the 1st round of the 2004 NFL Draft. After a promising 2004 rookie campaign with Tampa Bay, where he led all NFL rookies and the Buccaneers with 80 receptions for 1193 yards, and his team with 7 touchdowns, Clayton had a relatively disappointing season in 2005. With knee surgery in the offseason and a season riddled with small mistakes on the field, he finished up with just 32 receptions for a total of 372 yards and no touchdowns. He was forced to sit out the final game of the regular season against the New Orleans Saints with a turf toe injury, and also sat out the Buccaneers playoff match up against the Washington Redskins. His second season was very disappointing and inconsistent. The start to the 2006 season showed that Clayton had returned to his healthy past of 2004. Clayton looked good with 3 receptions and 34 yards despite the Buccaneers offensive struggles on September 10 in a 27–0 loss to the Baltimore Ravens. Continuing his return to his 2004 form, he caught 6 passes for 55 yards and a touchdown against the Cincinnati Bengals on October 15, 2006. His touchdown, thrown by Bruce Gradkowski, came with seconds left and gave the Tampa Bay Buccaneers the go ahead lead for their first win of the 2006 season. Unfortunately, following an undisclosed injury, the Buccaneers placed him on injured reserve, ending his season with four games remaining. He followed that overall performance with a forgettable 2007 season, although he did come on strong down the stretch. He made the most of his opportunities at the end, when the Buccaneers were resting many of their starters (which many analysts considered a mistake). He caught 22 passes during his 14-game season, 16 of those came in the last four contests and 10 coming in the last two. He also amassed 192 of his 301 yards in those four games. Clayton got to play in his first post- season contest on January 6, 2008 against the eventual Super Bowl-champion New York Giants. He caught 3 passes for 39 yards. After the 2008 season Clayton became a free agent, but re-signed with the Buccaneers to a new five-year deal.

Within the series' narrative, the Doctor is a centuries-old alien Time Lord from the planet Gallifrey who travels in time and space in the TARDIS, frequently with companions. At the end of life, the Doctor regenerates; as a result, the physical appearance and personality of the Doctor changes. Pertwee portrays the Third Doctor as a dapper man of action in stark contrast to his wily but less action-oriented predecessors. While previous Doctors' stories had all involved time and space travel, for production reasons Pertwee's stories initially depicted the Doctor stranded on Earth in exile, where he worked as a scientific advisor to the international military group UNIT. Within the story, the Third Doctor came into existence as part of a punishment from his own race, the Time Lords, who forced him to regenerate and also disabled his TARDIS. Eventually, this restriction is lifted and the Third Doctor embarks on more traditional time travel and space exploration stories. His initial companion is UNIT scientist Liz Shaw (Caroline John), who unceremoniously leaves the Doctor's company between episodes to be replaced by the more wide-eyed Jo Grant (Katy Manning), who then continues to accompany the Doctor after he regains use of his TARDIS. His final companion was intrepid journalist Sarah Jane Smith (Elisabeth Sladen). ==Personality== The Third Doctor was a suave, dapper, technologically oriented, and authoritative man of action who practised Venusian Aikido. A keen scientist, he maintained a laboratory at UNIT where he enjoyed working on gadgets in his TARDIS. In his spare time, he was fond of motoring, handling all manner of vehicles. His favourite car was a canary-yellow vintage roadster that he nicknamed \\"Bessie\\", a construct which featured such modifications as a remote control, dramatically increased speed capabilities, and inertial dampers. He also maintained a hovercraft-like vessel that fans nicknamed the Whomobile. The First Doctor, upon meeting the Third, described him indignantly as a \\"dandy\\", while the Second Doctor, with whom the Third had something of an antagonistic relationship on the occasions they encountered each other, referred to him as \\"Fancy Pants\\". While this incarnation spent most of his time exiled on Earth, where he grudgingly worked as UNIT's scientific advisor, he was occasionally sent on covert missions by the Time Lords, where he would often act as a reluctant mediator. Even though he developed a fondness for Earthlings with whom he worked (such as Liz Shaw and Jo Grant), he jumped at any chance to return to the stars. Though he had a somewhat patrician and authoritarian air, he was quick to criticise authority, and often exclaimed \\"Now listen to me!\\" when dealing with people seeking to obstruct him. Despite his occasional arrogance, the Third Doctor genuinely cared for his companions in a paternal fashion, and even held a thinly veiled but grudging admiration for his nemesis, the Master, and for UNIT's leader, Brigadier Lethbridge- Stewart, with whom he eventually became friends. In fact, even when his much- resented exile was lifted, the highly moral and dashing Third Doctor continued to help UNIT protect the Earth from all manner of alien threats, a role that continued into his future incarnations. In general, this incarnation of the Doctor was more physically daring than the previous two and was the first to confront an enemy physically if cornered (both of his previous incarnations nearly always attempted to dodge, flee or negotiate rather than attack). This often took the form of quick strikes, with the occasional joint lock or throw—usually enough to get himself and anyone accompanying him out of immediate danger, but usually not to the extent of a brawl, in keeping with the Doctor's non-violent nature. He only used his fighting skills if he had no alternative, and even then generally disarmed his opponents rather than knocking them unconscious. Indeed, his martial prowess was such that a single, sudden strike was usually enough to halt whatever threatened him, and at one point he reminded Captain Yates of UNIT (physically as well as verbally) that Yates would have a difficult time removing him from somewhere when he did not want to be removed (The Mind of Evil). The Third Doctor was a skilled diplomat (keeping talks going in The Curse of Peladon, for example) and linguist, as well as having a penchant for disguises. ===Appearance=== When asked to attend a Radio Times photo-call in 1969, Jon Pertwee arrived in what he thought was \\"a suitably eccentric outfit\\" from his family wardrobe, and the flamboyant image stuck with producer Barry Letts.Mulkern, Patrick. (1987). \\"Dressing the Doctor\\". Doctor Who Magazine. Autumn Special (Marvel Comics/BBC) p. 20. Through the first two seasons, he wore a flowing, crimson-lined cape over a black velvet smoking jacket and a ruffled shirt with a variety of neckties such as jabots, bow ties or cravats. Beginning in the 1971 season, when the look was refashioned by Ken Trew,Mulkern, p. 20. Pertwee wore a red jacket and a cloak with purple lining. In the final two seasons, the colour scheme changed from story to story, though the basic look was maintained. In his first episode, when the Doctor evades capture by taking a shower, a tattoo of a serpent can be seen on his arm. Whereas Pertwee obtained it during his service in the Royal Navy, an in-universe reason for it was eventually provided in the New Adventures novel Christmas on a Rational Planet as being a Time Lord symbol signifying exile, removed once the Doctor's exile was formally ended following the events of The Three Doctors. ==Story style== The Third Doctor stories were the first to be broadcast in colour. The early ones were set on Earth due to cost constraints on the series. To explain this, the Second Doctor was banished to Earth by his people, the Time Lords, and forced to regenerate. On Earth, he worked with the Brigadier and the rest of the UNIT team. However, as his tenure progressed he had reasons to leave Earth, on occasions being sent on missions by the Time Lords. Eventually, after his defeat of the renegade Omega in The Three Doctors, he was granted complete freedom by the Time Lords in gratitude for saving Gallifrey. The Third Doctor's era introduced adversaries including the Autons, the Master, Omega, the Sontarans, the Silurians, and the Sea Devils. The Daleks returned after a five-year absence about halfway through Pertwee's run. The Third Doctor was the only one from the classic series not to have a story featuring the Cybermen (although they were seen briefly in The Mind of Evilhttps://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/articles/15BgNB17yNS8rXyctS9hJTr/the- fourth-dimension and Carnival of Monsters),https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p01bnrc3/p01bnqqq but he did eventually encounter them during The Five Doctors. ==\\"Reverse the polarity of the neutron flow\\"== A catchphrase used during the Third Doctor's era was \\"reverse the polarity of the neutron flow\\". The phrase was Pertwee's way of dealing with the technobabble that he was required to speak as the Doctor. Terrance Dicks recalls that he had used the line in a script, and Pertwee approached him about the line. Dicks had feared that he would have to remove it, but Pertwee stated that he liked it, and wanted to see it more often. Dicks obliged.\\"Terrance Dicks: Fact & Fiction\\" (Horror of Fang Rock, BBCDVD1356) The Third Doctor only said the full phrase \\"reverse the polarity of the neutron flow\\" twice on screen – in The Sea Devils (1972) and the 20th Anniversary special The Five Doctors (1983). Pertwee used the phrase when he acted in the stage play Doctor Who – The Ultimate Adventure in 1989. When Colin Baker took over the role in the play he amended the line to \\"Reverse the linearity of the proton flow.\\" In the radio play The Paradise of Death, the Brigadier asks \\"Reverse the polarity of the neutron flow?\\" and the Doctor proceeds to explain that the phrase is meaningless (neutrons are chargeless, so to reverse the polarity of a neutron flow is to do nothing at all). On other occasions on screen, the Third Doctor \\"reversed the polarity\\" but not of neutrons. The full phrase was used in several Target novelisations. It was subsequently used by the Fourth Doctor (in City of Death) and the Fifth Doctor (in Castrovalva and Mawdryn Undead). Together with The Five Doctors, this resulted in the phrase being used as a nostalgic reference. In the Tenth Doctor episode \\"The Lazarus Experiment\\", the Doctor, while hiding in Lazarus' machine, comments that it had taken him too long to reverse the polarity due to being out of practice. The Tenth Doctor uses the full phrase in \\"Music of the Spheres\\". During the episode \\"The Almost People\\", a clone of the Eleventh Doctor speaks the phrase while reliving the memories of all his predecessors. He goes on to conflate it with his regeneration-spanning love of jelly babies, remarking that they need to \\"reverse the jelly baby of the neutron flow\\".Doctor Who (2005), S6E06, \\"The Almost People\\" In \\"The Day of the Doctor\\", the Eleventh Doctor invokes the phrase when confronting a time portal with the Tenth Doctor, suggesting that they both \\"reverse the polarity\\" with their sonic screwdrivers (which merely neutralizes each other’s efforts). In \\"The Girl Who Died\\", the Twelfth Doctor tells Clara Oswald he is \\"Reversing the polarity of the neutron flow\\", followed by \\"I bet that means something. It sounds great.\\" Clara herself uses the phrase, saying she \\"reversed the polarity\\" of a mind-wiping device to prevent the Doctor from erasing her memories of him from her mind (\\"Hell Bent\\"). In \\"It Takes You Away\\", Yasmin Khan suggests that the Thirteenth Doctor reverse the polarity on the sonic screwdriver in order to (successfully) open a locked inter-universe portal. ==Title sequence and logo== The original title sequence for the Third Doctor's seasons introduced colour and was an extension of the \\"howlround\\" kaleidoscopic patterns used for the previous Doctors. It features red, black then green flaming hands, then shows Jon Pertwee's face followed by a series of swirling lines to represent the time vortex, as the vortex turns red it speeds up only to start reversing and in some cases, the audience will see it turn pink and yellow. In the Third Doctor's final season, a new title sequence was introduced using a full-body picture of Pertwee, designed by Bernard Lodge. Partially inspired by the slit-scan hyperspace sequence in Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey, one portion of this sequence is the prototype for the classic time tunnel sequence of the Fourth Doctor's seasons. The Third Doctor's final season also introduced the equally classic diamond logo which would remain in use until 1980. The series logo introduced in 1970 and used for the first four seasons of Pertwee's tenure would later be used again, in modified form, as the logo for the 1996 Doctor Who TV movie. This version subsequently became the official Doctor Who logo, most notably with regards to products connected to the Eighth Doctor. With the introduction of a new official series logo in 2005, the 1996 logo continued to be used by Big Finish Productions as the logo for all pre-2005 series material including books and audio dramas, and by the BBC on DVD releases of episodes from the 1963–89 series, books and audio. ==Later appearances== The Third Doctor appeared again in the 20th anniversary special The Five Doctors, broadcast in 1983. A stage play, Doctor Who – The Ultimate Adventure, was produced in 1989, starring Jon Pertwee (occasionally replaced by an understudy then later, until the end of the production run, by Colin Baker as the Sixth Doctor). In 1993, he played the role again for the 30th Anniversary charity special Dimensions in Time, and in the audio drama The Paradise of Death. Months before his death, he played the Doctor for the final time in the audio drama The Ghosts of N-Space. From 2015, Big Finish had produced a new series of audio drama adventures featuring the Third Doctor titled The Third Doctor Adventures, with Tim Treloar voicing the role. ==Other mentions== Visions of the Third Doctor appear in The Brain of Morbius, Mawdryn Undead, and Resurrection of the Daleks. A portrait of him is seen in Timelash. A brief clip of the Third Doctor taken from Terror of the Autons appears in \\"The Next Doctor\\", another appears in The Sarah Jane Adventures serial The Mad Woman in the Attic as a flashback, and visions appear in \\"The Eleventh Hour\\", \\"The Lodger\\", \\"Nightmare in Silver\\", and The Sarah Jane Adventures serial Death of the Doctor. He was also seen in the episode \\"The Name of the Doctor\\" driving Bessie (taken from The Five Doctors), and archival footage was used for his appearance in \\"The Day of the Doctor\\". ==Other appearances== See List of non-televised Third Doctor stories. ==References* The Third Doctor on the BBC's Doctor Who website * Third Doctor Gallery * Third Doctor's theme music QuickTime file * Third Doctor title sequence * Interview with Jon Pertwee conducted in March 1996 03 03 Category:Fictional aikidoka Category:Male characters in television Category:Television characters introduced in 1970 ","title":"Third Doctor"},{"id":"1283412","text":"MacLean, Maclean, McLean, McClean, McLaine, and McClain is a Gaelic surname (MacGill-Eain in Scottish Gaelic, Mac Giolla Eáin in Irish Gaelic).

It was first published in 2004 by Hamish Hamilton; subsequent publications have been by Penguin Books. ==Central thesis== Status Anxiety is a 21st-century phenomenon which is a result of capitalism, democracy, and an ostensibly egalitarian society, and is prevalent in countries where an inequality in income is evident. Status Anxiety can be defined as the constant tension or fear of being perceived as \\"unsuccessful\\" by the society in materialistic terms. Today, every individual constantly tries to outsmart the others to climb up the social ladder. The effects of status anxiety can be impulse buying, status consumption etc. Meritocracy is a primary cause of status anxiety. Meritocracy is a society that believes that only the talented and the meritorious will end up at the top of the social ladder. Snobbery, envy, lovelessness are some other causes of status anxiety. De Botton first noticed this phenomenon among the wealthy families of America. The Americans had a lavish lifestyle and most of it was just to make the \\"neighbours\\" envious. America had also witnessed the trend of \\"Famous for being famous\\". Botton even met the American motivational speaker Les Brown to know how motivational speaking works. He concluded that motivational speakers conducted their speeches to induce status anxiety among individuals. Motivational speaking is based on the fact that \\"No one is living up to their true potential and everyone has scope for improvement. De Botton challenged this and asked \\"What about those who want to achieve but lack the opportunities to do so?\\" De Botton lays out the causes of and solutions to status anxiety as follows: Causes: * Lovelessness * Expectation * Meritocracy * Snobbery * Dependence Solutions: * Philosophy * Art * Politics * Religion * Bohemianism ==Film== A two-hour documentary film about this thesis, also called Status Anxiety and written by Alain de Botton, was released in 2004. A version of it was shown in 2008 on Public Broadcasting Service channels like Boston WGBH-TV's digital channel WGBX-TV in the United States. ==See also== * Social status * Affluenza *Feelings of insignificance == External links == * Status Anxiety - Alain de Botton website Category:Sociology books Category:2004 non-fiction books Category:Hamish Hamilton books Category:Books by Alain de Botton Category:Books adapted into films ","title":"Status Anxiety"},{"id":"1283447","text":"A halter or headcollar is headgear that is used to lead or tie up livestock and, occasionally, other animals; it fits behind the ears (behind the poll), and around the muzzle.

A halter is used to lead and tie up an animal.Loch, Wayne. \\"Haltering and Tying Horses.\\" Department of Animal Sciences, University of Missouri Extension. G2844, revised August 2002. Web site accessed March 19, 2008 It is used on many different types of livestock. Halters are most closely associated with Equidae such as horses, donkeys, and mules. However, they are also used on farm animals such as cattle and goats and other working animals such as camels, llamas, and yaks. Halters generally are not used on elephants or on predators, though there are halters made for dogs. Halters are often plain in design, used as working equipment on a daily basis. In addition to the halter, a lead line, lead shank or lead rope is required to actually lead or tie the animal. It is most often attached to the halter at a point under the jaw, or less often, at the cheek, usually with a snap, but occasionally spliced directly onto the halter. A standard working lead rope is approximately long. Horse shown in hand, wearing a Yorkshire halter. However, specially designed halters, sometimes highly decorated, are used for in-hand or \\"halter\\" classes at horse shows and in other livestock shows. When an animal is shown in an exhibition, the show halter is fitted more closely than a working halter and may have a lead shank that tightens on the head so that commands from the handler may be more discreetly transmitted by means of the leadline. A shank that tightens on the animal's head when pulled is not used for tying the animal. Halters are designed to catch, hold, lead and tie animals, and nothing else. However, some people ride horses using a halter instead of a bridle. In most cases, it is not safe to ride in an ordinary stable halter because it fits loosely and provides no leverage to the rider should a horse panic or bolt. It is particularly unsafe if the lead rope is used as a single rein, attached to the leading ring under the jaw. ==Construction== A rope horse halter Sheep wearing a cotton rope halter. Halters may be classified into two broad categories, depending on whether the material used is flat or round. Materials include cured leather, rawhide, rope, and many different fibers, including nylon, polyester, cotton, and jute. Leather and rawhide may be flat or rolled. Fibers may be woven into flat webbing or twisted into round rope. Flat or round dictates the construction method: flat materials normally are sewn to buckles or rings at attachment points; round materials are knotted or spliced. Knotted halters often are made from a single piece of rope. ==Horse halters== The Halter was patented in the United States by Henry Wagner of Toledo, Iowa February 13, 1894.United States Patent Office, Patent No. US000514523 An Arabian horse in a stylized show halter Horse halters are sometimes confused with a bridle.The primary difference between a halter and a bridle is that a halter is used by a handler on the ground to lead or tie up an animal, but a bridle is generally used by a person who is riding or driving an animal that has been trained in this use. A halter is safer than a bridle for tying, as the bit of a bridle may injure the horse's mouth if the horse sets back while tied with a bridle, and in addition, many bridles are made of lighter materials and will break. On the other hand, a bridle offers more precise control. One common halter design is made of either flat nylon webbing or flat leather, has a noseband that passes around the muzzle with one ring under the jaw, usually used to attach a lead rope, and two rings on either side of the head. The noseband is usually adjusted to lie about halfway between the end of the cheekbones and the corners of the mouth, crossing over the strong, bony part of the face. The noseband connects to a cheekpiece on either side that go up next to the cheekbone to meet with a ring on either side that usually is placed just above the level of the eye. These rings meet the throatlatch and the crownpiece. The crownpiece is a long strap on the right-hand side of the halter that goes up behind the ears, over the poll and is buckled to a shorter strap coming up from the left. The throatlatch goes under the throat, and sometimes has a snap or clip that allows the halter to be removed in a manner similar to the bridle. Many halters have another short strap connecting the noseband and the throatlatch. The halter design made of rope also has the same basic sections, but usually is joined by knots instead of sewn into rings. Most designs have no metal parts, other than, in some cases, a metal ring under the jaw where the lead rope snaps, or, occasionally, a recessed hook attachment where the crownpiece can be connected. However, in many cases, a loop is formed in the left side of the crownpiece and the right side of the crownpiece simply is brought over the horse's head, through the loop and tied with a sheet bend.Description of rope halter design and how to tie one. Web page accessed March 17, 2008 ==Leading== In addition to the halter, usually a lead (lead line, lead rope) or leash is used to lead or tie the animal. The lead is attached to the halter most often at a point under the jaw, less often at the cheek, and rarely above the nose. On horses, a lighter version of a headcollar or headstall is also used to attach a fly veil of waxed cotton strands or light leather strips onto a browband. Some fly masks are also made in a similar pattern to a headcollar and are often fastened with velcro tabs. These masks may also have ear and nose protection added to them. On both horses and dogs, halters may be used to attach a muzzle. ==Safety and security issues== A modified sheet bend with the end falling away from the horse's head is used to secure a rope halter that lacks buckles For tying, it is disputed if a halter should be made strong enough not to break under stress, or if it should give way when tension reaches a certain point in order to prevent injury to the animal. Usually the issue is of minimal concern if a tied animal is attended and the lead rope is tied with a slip knot that can be quickly released if the animal panics. However, in cases where a non-slip knot is tied, or if a soft rope is drawn tight and the knot cannot be released, or if the animal is left unsupervised, an animal panicking and attempting to escape can be seriously injured. Those who argue that the risk of injury is more of a concern than the risk of escape recommend halter designs that incorporate breakaway elements, such as a leather crownpiece, breakaway buckles, or easily detachable lead rope. Those who believe that escape is the greater danger, either due to concerns about escape or creating a recurring bad habit in an animal that learns to break loose that could become unable to be kept tied at all, recommend sturdy designs that will not break unless the handler deliberately releases a slipknot or cuts the lead rope. Between the two camps are those who recommend sturdy halters that will not break under normal pressure from a momentarily recalcitrant or frightened animal, but ultimately will break in a true panic situation, such as a fall. Some users have the animal wear a halter at all times, even when stalled or turned out. Others have the animal wear a halter only when being led, held, or tied. The advantages of leaving a halter on are that the animal is often easier to catch. The disadvantages are that an animal may catch the halter on an object and become trapped or injured in some fashion. While experts advise leaving halters off when animals are turned out, if halters are left on unattended animals, breakaway designs that still will hold for everyday leading are recommended. ==See also== *Horse tack *Collar (animal) ==References== ==Sources== *http://www.equisearch.com/uncategorized/your-choice-horse-halter- matters/ == External links == Category:Animal equipment Category:Dog equipment Category:In-hand showing Category:Headgear (horse) ","title":"Halter"},{"id":"1283449","text":"An ice resurfacer lays down a layer of clean water, which will freeze to form a smooth ice surface. An ice resurfacer is a vehicle or hand-pushed device used to clean and smooth the surface of a sheet of ice, usually in an ice rink. The first ice resurfacer was developed by American inventor and engineer Frank Zamboni in 1949 in the city of Paramount, California. As such, an ice resurfacer is often referred to as a \\"Zamboni\\" regardless of brand or manufacturer. ==History== The first ice resurfacer was invented by Frank Zamboni, who was originally in the refrigeration business. Zamboni created a plant for making ice blocks that could be used in refrigeration applications. As the demand for ice blocks waned with the spread of compressor-based refrigeration, he looked for another way to capitalize on his expertise with ice production. In 1939, Zamboni built the Iceland Skating Rink in Paramount, California. In order to resurface the skating rink, 3 or 4 workers had to scrape, wash, and squeegee the ice. A thin layer of water was then added for the fresh ice. This process was extremely time consuming, and Zamboni wanted to find a more efficient way to resurface the ice. From 1942 to 1947, he worked to develop a vehicle that could cut down on resurfacing time. In 1947, he built a machine that would shave, wash and squeegee the ice. This machine was mounted on an army surplus Willys Jeep chassis. A blade was mounted on the machine, which would shave the ice; the ice would then receive a thin layer of water creating a smooth sheet of ice. The prototype had a tank that held the ice shavings, which were carried to the tank via a conveyor belt. Zamboni abandoned this model in late 1947 because of deficiencies with the blade and handling. A new machine was developed using another army surplus vehicle chassis. This machine had four-wheel drive as well as all-wheel steering. By 1949, the Model A Zamboni Ice Resurfacer was developed. Further modification to the Model A included the addition of a wash water tank and a cover for the snow-holding tank (for ice shavings). The all-wheel steering feature was reduced to only front-wheel steering because the machine constantly got wedged against the boards. The Zamboni ice-resurfacer was patented in 1953. A Zamboni ice resurfacer at work in Gdańsk. The Model B was the next ice resurfacer made by Zamboni. The Zamboni Model C was also built on the same frame, but more design changes were applied. The driver's position was raised for better visibility, and the capacity of the snow-holding tank was increased. From the late 1950s to 1964, there were minimal changes in how the ice-resurfacers were designed. The introduction of the HD series in 1964 saw a shift in the design of the Zamboni ice resurfacers. Instead of relying on a conveyor belt system to move the ice shavings into the snow-holding tank, a vertical screw conveyor system was installed, and a new hydraulic snow-dumping system was adopted. This design has been the industry standard since it was first adopted. In 1967, an Elmira, Ontario-based welder named Andrew Schlupp founded the Resurfice Corporation and began producing competing models of resurfacers, including their popular Olympia line. In 1980 an Italian company, Engo Ice Arena Equipment, began producing ice resurfacers. == Technology == Ice resurfacers are generally composed of a snow container, hot water tanks, a wash water tank, the conditioner, and a board brush. The engine or motor of the vehicle is responsible both for propelling the resurfacer and also powering the hydraulics that control the various functions, such as lowering the conditioner or raising the snow dump. Most of the actual resurfacing components are contained in a heavy device at the rear of the machine, known as the \\"conditioner\\". The conditioner is hydraulically lowered to the ice surface, its weight providing the friction necessary for a large, sharp blade (similar to those used in industrial paper cutters) to shave off the top layer of ice. A horizontal auger conveyor collects these ice shavings, or snow, and funnels them to a vertical auger at the center of the conditioner. The shavings are then carried upward and sprayed into a large snow container, which takes up most of the volume of the resurfacer. The height of the blade can be adjusted by the driver, allowing deeper or shallower cuts. This is useful for keeping the ice sheet level, improving the quality of the cut, and preventing the snow container from overflowing. Wash water can be used to further improve the quality of the ice by removing debris and snow from deep skate-blade cuts. Located directly in front of the blade, nozzles forcefully spray water into the ice surface, loosening deep debris. Runners on either side of the conditioner contain the spray, while a rubber squeegee at the rear of the conditioner allows a vacuum nozzle to pick up excess water. This water is then filtered through a screen and recirculated. Before mechanized ice resurfacers were invented, hand flooders such as this one were pulled around the rink laying an even layer of hot water. This flooder is in the collection of the International Hockey Hall of Fame Finally, a layer of water is laid down to fill in the remaining grooves in the ice. The ice-making water is released through a sprinkler pipe at the rear of the conditioner, which wets the cloth towel that is dragged behind the resurfacer. The towel ensures a smooth, controlled deposition of water. Traditionally, hot water has been used because it slightly melts the layer of ice below it, leading some operators to believe it forms a stronger bond during the freezing process because heating the water releases dissolved gases thus allowing the ice to freeze in a clearer state as well as reduces the freezing time of the water due to the Mpemba effect. The water used in some rinks is also filtered and treated before being used in the ice resurfacer to remove any minerals or chemicals in the water. These impurities can otherwise make the ice brittle, soft, give it undesirable odors, or change the color and clarity. Many ice resurfacers are fitted with a \\"board brush\\", a rotary brush powered by a hydraulic motor. The board brush is extended and retracted on the left side of the machine by a hydraulic arm. This allows the operator to collect ice shavings and debris that accumulate along the edge of the rink (along the kick plates below the dasher boards of the rink) where the conditioner cannot easily reach. The brush sweeps the accumulations into the path of the conditioner, which removes them from the ice. The use of a board brush can dramatically reduce the need for edging of the rink. After resurfacing the entire sheet, also known as an \\"ice cut\\" or \\"flood\\", the snow container must be emptied. Hydraulics raise one end of the container, causing the snow to spill out. Smaller, cheaper machines have also been designed to provide a smooth ice surface in a manner similar to a traditional resurfacer. These can be either self-propelled or pushed/pulled by the operator. Self-propelled vehicles typically incorporate the main components of full-size ice resurfacer, including a blade and water tank, but on a smaller scale. These are usually mounted to an ATV or golf cart-like vehicle. == Ice edgers == The ice around the edges of a rink has a tendency to build up because the conditioner blade does not extend all the way to the outer edges of the conditioner and it is unwise to \\"ride\\" (drive with the conditioner touching) the dasher boards. An ice edger is a small device similar to a rotary lawn mower that is used to shave down the edges of the ice surface that the ice resurfacer cannot cut. An ice edger cannot shave ice that has an overall bowl or mushroom shape. Drivers using latest model ice resurfacing equipment can effectively cut ice edges within millimeters of the dasher board. == In popular culture == *Starting in 1980, Charles M. Schulz incorporated Zambonis into his Peanuts comic strip as well as into the 1980 television special She's a Good Skate, Charlie Brown, increasing public awareness of them. *In the sitcom Cheers, the character Eddie LeBec (Jay Thomas) is killed by a Zamboni in the episode \\"Death Takes a Holiday on Ice\\" (1989). Ken Levine, who co-wrote the episode, recalled, \\"We were worried that we wouldn’t be able to use the name Zamboni but the company loved it.\\" *The term \\"Zamboni\\" got a further boost in popular recognition from the 1992 Winter Olympics, when skater Laëtitia Hubert fell so many times she was nicknamed the \\"Human Zamboni\\", and the usage of the term \\"Zamboni\\" in its general sense subsequently expanded by an order of magnitude. *In video game Plants vs. Zombies features a zombie opponent called Zomboni (portmanteau of Zombie and Zamboni) which rides a Zamboni to crush plants and resurface the lawn to prevent players placing new plants. *On January 16, 2013, in honor of Frank Zamboni's 112th birthday, Google published a Google Doodle dedicated to him. The doodle is a game where the player can clean the surface of a virtual ice rink using an ice resurfacer. *In the 2014 film Dumb and Dumber To, the protagonists, Harry (Jeff Daniels) and Lloyd (Jim Carrey), reach El Paso on a Zamboni that they stole from an ice rink. *In the 2016 superhero movie Deadpool, the titular character uses a Zamboni to run over a heavily injured opponent as an act of vengeance. == References == == External links == * How does an ice-resurfacing machine work? * Zamboni Google Doodle * Zamboni Driver Explains The Art Of Making Ice Video produced by Wisconsin Public Television * Ice Resurfacers (Including Zamboni Machines) at The Canadian Encyclopedia Category:Figure skating Resurfacer Category:Bandy equipment Category:Land vehicles Category:American inventions ","title":"Ice resurfacer"},{"id":"1283475","text":"A demonstration on Parliament Hill by members of Citizens for a Canadian Republic during the installation ceremony of Governor General of Canada Michaëlle Jean, 2005 Canadian republicanism is a movement among Canadians for the replacement of the Canadian system of federal constitutional monarchy with a republican form of government. These beliefs are expressed either individually—usually in academic circles—or through the country's one republican lobby group. Republicans have no preferred model of republic, as individuals are driven by various factors, such as a perceived practicality of popular power being placed in the hands of an elected prime Minister or a different manifestation of the modern nation. As with its political counterpart, strong republicanism is not a prevalent element of contemporary Canadian society. The movement's roots precede Canadian Confederation and it has emerged from time to time in Canadian politics, but has not been a dominant force since the Rebellions of 1837, of which Canadian republicans consider their efforts to be a continuation. ==National identity== Republicans in Canada assert that their country's monarchy, due either to its popular associations with the United Kingdom, its shared nature, or both, cannot be representative of the Canadian nation. Their position is that because of its hereditary aspects and the sovereign's role as Supreme Governor of the Church of England (though he or she is such in England only; the monarch has no religious role in Canada), the monarchy is inherently contrary to egalitarianism and multiculturalism. Further, though it diverges from both the official position of the Canadian government and the opinions of some judges, legal scholars, and members of the Royal Family themselves, republicans deem the King or Queen of Canada to be either a solely British or English individual representing a British institution foreign to Canada. Founded on this perception is the republican assertion that national pride is diminished by the monarchy, its presence negating the country's full independence achieved in 1982, and makes Canada appear colonial and subservient to the United Kingdom, under which they feel Canadians suffered \\"military, economic, and cultural subjugation.\\" Instead, equating anti-monarchism with patriotism, they desire a Canadian citizen to act as head of state and promote the national flag and/or the \\"country\\" as a more fitting locus of allegiance. This questioning of the monarchy's role in Canadian identity arose as a part of wider cultural changes that followed the evolution of the British Empire into the Commonwealth of Nations, the rise of anti-establishmentism, the creation of multiculturalism as an official policy in Canada, and the blossoming of Quebec separatism; the latter becoming the major impetus of political controversy around the Crown. Quebec nationalists agitated for an independent Quebec republic—such as the Marxist form desired by the Front de libération du Québec—and the monarchy was targeted as a symbol of anti-Anglophone demonstration, notably when assassination threats were in 1964 made against Queen Elizabeth II and Quebecers turned their backs on her procession when she toured Quebec City that year. In a 1970 speech to the Empire Club of Canada, former Governor General Roland Michener summed up the contemporary arguments against the Crown: From its opponents, he said, came the claims that monarchies are unfashionable, republics—other than those with oppressive regimes—offer more freedom, people are given greater dignity from choosing their head of state, the monarchy is foreign and incompatible with Canada's multicultural society, and that there should be change for the sake of change alone. However, though it was later thought the Quiet Revolution and the period beyond should have inspired more republicanism amongst Canadians, they did not. Reg Whitaker blamed this on a combination of Quebec nationalists having no interest in the monarchy (as full sovereignty and their own form of government was their ultimate goal) with the remainder of the population simultaneously struggling with \\"bilingualism, dualism, special status, distinct society, asymmetrical federalism, sovereignty-association, partnership, and so on.\\" Even the rise in multi-ethnic immigration to Canada in the 1970s did not inspire any desires to alter or remove the role of the Crown in Canada, the ethno-cultural groups not wanting to push constitutional change over a matter they had little concern for. Instead, until the appointment of Stephen Harper as prime minister, successive governments made subtle efforts to diminish the stature of the Canadian monarchy—as David Smith said: \\"the historic Crown with its anthem, emblems, and symbolism made accessible a past the government of the day rejected\\"—though never, since the reaction to some of Pierre Trudeau's proposals for alterations to the monarchy and its role in Canada, publicly revealing their stances on the Crown. ==Democratic principles and governmental role== Canadian republicans view their country's monarchy as \\"outdated and irrelevant\\" and an undemocratic institution because the incumbent sovereign is neither elected and nor a citizen once on the throne; republicans will phrase this argument as \\"no Canadian citizen can become head of state.\\" Without the democratic legitimacy they personally desire, some anti-monarchists refuse to recognize the authority of the Crown, expressing this through, for example, vandalism of royal symbols or ignoring the enforcement of traffic law by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. In contrast to monarchist arguments, those against the Crown assert that it is possible to have an elected head of state be an apolitical individual and there would be no possibility of a clash with the prime minister over differences in political persuasion, though some republicans do desire an empowered chief executive who could hold the Cabinet in check for political reasons. Others feel an appointed Canadian president would be more democratic than the Crown. The range of often contradictory proposals highlights the fact that Canadian republicans are not fully united on what sort of republican form of government they believe the nation should adopt. The Westminster-style parliamentary republican model, which is advocated by other Commonwealth republican movements, has been embraced by Citizens for a Canadian Republic as the preferred model for Canada. Towards that end, Citizens for a Canadian Republic proposed in March 2004 that the federal viceroy be made an elected position as a first step towards some form of republic. As the normal channels of appointment would follow after the election, no constitutional reform would be necessary. However, as monarchists point out, the scheme does not take into consideration any provincial input, especially concerning the relationship between the provincial and federal crowns and thus the lieutenant governors; an issue that would weigh heavily in any constitutional debate on the Crown, regardless of the selection process of the governor general. ==History of issue== ===Colonial era and Confederation=== Reformists began to emerge in the Canadian colonies during the early 19th century and by two decades into that century had begun to cohere into organized groups, such as the Upper Canada Central Political Union. The idea of political party was viewed by a number of British North Americans as an innovation of the United States, being \\"anti-British and of a republican tendency.\\" Colonists were warned about \\"a few individuals, who unfortunately, are led by those, whose hostility to the British constitution is such, that they would sacrifice any and every thing to pull it down, in order that they might build up a Republic on its ruins.\\" It was believed that the persons agitating for republican change and their supporters were of American origin and had been taught to admire republican government as the best in the world and ridicule monarchism. William Lyon Mackenzie, founder of the Republic of Canada, and later advocate of Canadian annexation into the United States The first open uprisings in Canada against the monarchical system came in 1837, with the Lower Canada Rebellion—led by Louis Joseph Papineau and his Parti Patriote—and the Upper Canada Rebellion—led by William Lyon Mackenzie. Though their main motives were for more representative government in their respective colonies, Mackenzie was inspired by the American model and wished to establish the same in Canada. Papineau originally expressed loyalty to the Crown in his Ninety-Two Resolutions, but turned when the British parliament instead adopted the Earl Russell's Ten Resolutions, which ignored all 92 of the requests from the Parti Patriote. Most colonists, however, did not espouse a break with the Crown and the rebellions ultimately failed. Mackenzie fled Toronto with 200 supporters and established, with the help of American sympathizers, the short-lived and never recognized Republic of Canada on Navy Island, while Papineau and other insurgents fled to the United States and proclaimed the Republic of Lower Canada. After living in the US in order to avoid arrest in Canada, Mackenzie eventually became dissatisfied with the American republican system and gave up plans for revolution in the British North American provinces, though he theorized, near the end of his life, on Canadian annexation into the United States, should enough people in the former country become disillusioned with responsible government. Similarly, by 1849, Papineau was advocating the absorption of the Province of Canada (formed in 1840) into the American republic to the south. He echoed a significant minority of conservatives in Upper Canada who critiqued Canada's imitation of the British parliamentary constitutional monarchy as both too democratic and too tyrannical, theorizing that it simultaneously destroyed the independence of the appointed governor and legislative council and further concentrated power in the Cabinet. Instead, these \\"republican conservatives\\" preferred the American federal-state system and the US constitution, seeing the American model of checks and balances as offering Canada a more fair and conservative form of democracy. They debated constitutional changes that included an elected governor, an elected legislative council, and a possible union with the US, within this republican framework. Louis Riel, President of the provisional government of Red River Some decades later, in 1869, a rebellion in the Red River area of Rupert's Land erupted under the leadership of Louis Riel, who established in the Red River settlement a provisional government under John Bruce as president, with the intent of negotiating a provincial relationship with the federal government of Canada. As negotiations proceeded, Riel was eventually elected as president by the provisional government's council. His delegation to Ottawa was eventually successful in having the federal Crown-in-Council in 1870 found the province of Manitoba with the same parliamentary constitutional monarchy as existed in the other provinces. ===Post-Quebec sovereignty movement=== The Parti Québécois rose to power in Quebec on the support of nationalists, with views towards the monarchy that ranged from hostility to indifference. In February 1968, during a constitutional conference in Ottawa, delegates from the Union Nationale-governed Quebec indicated that a provincial president might suit the province better than the appointed viceroy. Two years later, Parti Québécois (PQ) members of the National Assembly refused to recite the constitutionally mandated Oath of Allegiance to the sovereign before taking their seats in the legislature. Sovereignists protested the Queen's role in officially opening the 1976 Montreal Olympics, with René Lévesque asking Elizabeth to refuse the advice from prime minister Pierre Trudeau and not open the games. Republican options were discussed following the election of the sovereigntist Parti Québécois to government in Quebec, but only specifically in relation to the province. Continuing talks of constitutional reform led to the role of the monarchy in Canada coming under scrutiny in the lead up to the patriation of the Canadian constitution in 1982. However, proposals for change were thwarted by the provinces, including Quebec. The notion of a republic was raised publicly in the early 1990s, when Peter C. Newman wrote in Maclean's that the monarchy should be abolished in favour of a head of state \\"who would reflect our own, instead of imported, values.\\" Then, in 1997, Deputy Prime Minister John Manley echoed Newman when he expressed at the end of a television interview his opinion that Canada should abolish its monarchy, citing Australia's contemporary discussions around the Australian Crown. Then, in December of the following year, the Prime Minister's press secretary, Peter Donolo, who also complained that the monarch made Canada appear as a \\"colonial outpost\\", unaccountably announced through a media story that the Prime Minister's Office was considering the abolition of the monarchy as a millennium project, though no definitive plans had been made. Donolo later supported Manley when, on Victoria Day 2001, Manley said on CBC Radio that he believed that hereditary succession was outdated, and that the country's head of state should be elected. Then, just prior to the Queen's pan-country tour to celebrate her Golden Jubilee the following year, Manley (at that point the designated minister in attendance for the sovereign's arrival in Ottawa) again stated his preference for a \\"wholly Canadian\\" institution to replace the present monarchy after the reign of Queen Elizabeth II; he was rebuked by other Cabinet members, a former prime minister, and the Leader of the Opposition, as well as a number of prominent journalists. In 2002, the group Citizens for a Canadian Republic was established to promote the abolition of the Canadian monarchy in favour of a republic, at approximately the same time The Globe and Mail newspaper began a campaign against the monarchy, with three republican journalists on staffMargaret Wente, Jeffrey Simpson, and Lawrence Martinthough the editorial board argued Canada could dispose of its monarchy without becoming a republic. Tom Freda, chairman and co-founder of Citizens for a Canadian Republic, called for simply replacing the monarchy with the Governor General, saying that he's not in favour of destroying Canada's identity or cultural institutions: \\"All we're advocating is that the link to the monarchy, in our Constitution, be severed. Our governor general for the past 60 years has performed all the duties of a head of state, and there's no reason we shouldn't make our governor general our official head of state.\\" At approximately the same time, the editors of The Globe and Mail began calling for the Governor General to be made head of state under the guise of \\"patriating the monarchy\\", and arguing that Canada could rid itself of its Crown without becoming a republic, and backing their journalist Jeffrey Simpson's preference for the Companions of the Order of Canada to choose the head of state in a Canadian republic. Lawrence Martin called for Canada to become a republic in order to re-brand the nation and better its standings in the international market, he cited Sweden – a constitutional monarchy – as an example to be followed. In 2007, Quebec sovereignty again collided with the monarchy, when Quebec separatists threatened to mount demonstrations should the Queen be in attendance at the ceremonies for the 400th anniversary of Quebec City; Mario Beaulieu, then Vice-President of the Saint-Jean-Baptiste Society announced that the Queen's presence would be a catalyst for action, saying: \\"You can be sure that people will demonstrate in protest... We are celebrating the foundation of New France, not its conquest. The monarchy remains a symbol of imperialism and colonialism. Her presence will not be welcomed\\", and Gérald Larose, president of the Quebec Sovereignty Council, stated that the monarchy was \\"the most despicable, appalling, anti-democratic, imperial, colonial symbol against which all social and individuals rights were obtained through the course of history.\\" At the Liberal Party of Canada convention in January 2012, its members debated on a motion to include severing ties with the monarchy as a party platform. The proposed motion was rejected by 67 per cent. ==Activities== As abolition of the monarchy would require a constitutional amendment made only after the achievement of unanimous consent amongst the federal parliament and all ten provincial legislatures, republicans face difficulty in achieving their goal. Further, though republicans have pointed to Ireland and India as models that could be adapted to Canada, no specific form of republic or selection method for a president has been decided on, and the Canadian populace remains largely indifferent to the issue. To date, most republican action has taken the form of protests on Victoria Daythe Canadian sovereign's official birthdayin Toronto, lobbying of the federal and provincial governments to eliminate Canadian royal symbols, and legal action against the Crown, specifically in relation to the Oath of Citizenship and the Act of Settlement 1701. Ted McWhinney has argued that Canada can become a republic upon the demise of the current Queen by not proclaiming a successor; according to McWhinney, this would be a way for the constitution to evolve \\"more subtly and by indirection, through creating new glosses on the Law of the Constitution as written, without formally amending it.\\" However, Ian Holloway, Dean of Law at the University of Western Ontario, criticised this proposal for its ignorance of provincial input, and opined that its implementation \\"would be contrary to the plain purpose of those who framed our system of government.\\" ==See also== * Debate on the monarchy in Canada * Monarchism in Canada * Constitutional monarchy * Republicanism ==Further reading== * Ajzenstat, Janet and Peter J.

F was developed as a modern Fortran, thus making it a subset of Fortran 95. It combines both numerical and data abstraction features from these languages. F is also backwards compatible with Fortran 77, allowing calls to Fortran 77 programs. F was first included in the g95 compiler. == Overview == F is designed to be a minimal subset of Fortran, with only about one hundred intrinsic procedures. Language keywords and intrinsic function names are reserved keywords in F and no other names may take this exact form. F contains the same character set used in Fortran 90/95 with a limit of 132 characters. Reserved words are always written in lowercase. Any uppercase letter may appear in a character constant. Variable names do not have restriction and can include upper and lowercase characters. ===Operators=== F supports many of the standard operators used in Fortran. The operators supported by F are: * Arithmetic operators: \`+\`, \`-\`, \`*\`, \`/\`, \`**\` * Relational operators: \`<\`, \`<=\`, \`==\`, \`/=\`, \`>\`, \`>=\` * Logical operators: \`.not.\`, \`.and.\`, \`.or.\`, \`.eqv.\`, \`.neqv.\` * character concatenation: \`//\` The assignment operator is denoted by the equal sign \`=\`. In addition, pointer assignment is denoted by \`=>\`. Comments are denoted by the \`!\` symbol: variable = expression ! assignment pointer => target ! pointer assignment ===Data types=== Similar to Fortran, the type specification is made up of a type, a list of attributes for the declared variables, and the variable list. F provides all the same types as Fortran as well, with the sole exception of doubles: ! type [,attribute list] :: entity declaration list real :: x, y ! declaring variables of type real x,y without an attribute list integer (kind = long), dimension (100) :: x ! declaring variable of type big integer array with the identifier x character (len = 100) :: student_name ! declaring a character type variable with len 100 F does not have intrinsic support for object-oriented programming, but it does allow for records: type, public :: City character (len = 100) :: name character (len = 50) :: state end type City Variable declarations are followed by an attribute list. The attributes allowed are \`parameter\`, \`public\`, \`private\`, \`allocatable\`, \`dimension\`, \`intent\`, \`optional\`, \`pointer\`, \`save\` and \`target\`. The attribute list is followed by \`::\`, which is part of the syntax. F also allows for optional initialization in the list of objects. All items in a list will have the same attributes in a given type declaration statement. In addition, declarations are attribute oriented instead of entity oriented. ===Statement and control flow=== F supports 3 statements for control flow: \`if\`, a basic conditional, \`case\`, a switch statement, and \`do\`, a conditional while loop. The \`return\`, \`stop\`, \`cycle\`, and \`exit\` statements from Fortran may be used to break control flow. real :: x do i = 100 x += i print i cycle end do max : do if (x > y) then exit max: end if x = y; end max stop if (x < y) then x = x + y; else if ( x > y) then x = y - x; end if select case (maximum): case (0) x = 0 case (1) x = 1 case (5) x = 5 case default x = 10 end select F places a heavy emphasis on modular programming. Modules in F are called \\"programs\\": program main ! Insert code here end program main Placing procedures outside of a module is prohibited. F supports most of the modules and subroutines found in the Fortran 95 standard library. All procedures in F are external by default, and require a result clause that returns the value of a function. F supports recursion. All of the intrinsic procedures found in Fortran 95 may be used in F, with the exceptions of \`achar\`, \`iachar\`, \`lge\`, \`lgt\`, \`lle\`, \`llt\`, \`transfer\`, \`dble\`, \`dim\`, \`dprod\`, and \`mod\`. == References == == External links == * F Programming Language Homepage * g95 compiler Category:Fortran programming language family Category:Programming languages ","title":"F (programming language)"},{"id":"1283518","text":"Caridina multidentata is a species of shrimp in the family Atyidae. It is native to Japan and Taiwan.De Grave, S., Shy, J. & Cai, X. 2013. Caridina multidentata. The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species 2013. Downloaded on 14 June 2016.

Accessed through World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) on 14 June 2016. ==Description== This species has a translucent body covered with a broken line of reddish brown points on its sides. The dorsal surface has a white stripe that runs from the head to the tail and the eyes are black. Females are easily distinguished from males by their more elongated lower row of dots. Caridina multidentata fare best in temperatures of 18°C to 28°C. They are more active at higher temperatures, but may also have a shorter lifespan. They prefer a pH of 6.5 to 7.5. As with all crustaceans, they are extremely averse to copper due to their haemocyanin blood. Caridina multidentata mate in freshwater streams and marshes. Female shrimp signal readiness to mate much like other shrimp species, by releasing pheromones into the water for the males to follow. The fertilized eggs are released and go through larval stages in brackish and salt water as they drift out to sea. The larvae return from the sea once they reach their final growth stage, and they remain in freshwater for the remainder of their lives. ==In captivity== left According to different sources, Caridina multidentata was introduced into the world of aquaria by Takashi Amano in the early 1980s. They are usually used in an aquarium because they feed primarily on algae, thus cleaning the aquarium of it in large numbers. Caridina multidentata was previously known to aquarists as Caridina japonica but was renamed Caridina multidentata following a study in 2006. ==References== ==External links== * *Amano shrimp (Caridina multidentata), Aquarium Wiki Category:Atyidae Category:Freshwater crustaceans of Asia Category:Crustaceans described in 1860 Category:Crustaceans of Japan Category:Arthropods of Korea Category:Arthropods of Taiwan Category:Algae eaters Category:Taxa named by William Stimpson ","title":"Caridina multidentata"},{"id":"1283522","text":"Middle Town may refer to: *Middle Town, California, United States *Middle Town, St Agnes - a settlement on the island of St Agnes in the Isles of Scilly, of the English coast *Middle Town, St Martin's - a settlement on the island of St Martin's in the Isles of Scilly, of the English coast *Szczecin- Srodmiescie, Poland (\\"Middle Town\\" in Polish) ==See also== *Middletown (disambiguation) ","title":"Middle Town"},{"id":"1283532","text":"Anthony Walter Patrick Hamilton (17 March 1904 – 23 September 1962) was an English playwright and novelist. He was well regarded by Graham Greene and J. B. Priestley, and study of his novels has been revived because of their distinctive style, deploying a Dickensian narrative voice to convey aspects of inter-war London street culture. They display a strong sympathy for the poor, as well as an acerbic black humour. Doris Lessing wrote in The Times in 1968: \\"Hamilton was a marvellous novelist who's grossly neglected\\". His two most successful plays, Rope and Gas Light, were made into famous films: Alfred Hitchcock's Rope (1948) and the British-made Gaslight (1940), followed by the 1944 American version. The term \\"gaslighting\\", for a form of psychological abuse, comes from his play. == Life and works == Hamilton was born on 17 March 1904, in the Sussex village of Hassocks, near Brighton, to writer parents. Due to his father's alcoholism and financial ineptitude, the family spent much of Hamilton's childhood living in boarding houses in Chiswick and Hove. His education was patchy, and ended just after his fifteenth birthday when his mother withdrew him from Westminster School. His first published work was a poem, \\"Heaven\\", in the Poetry Review in 1919. His sister Lalla, acted under the name of Diana Hamilton and starred in Sutton Vane's Outward Bound. After a brief career as an actor, he became a novelist in his early twenties with the publication of Monday Morning (1925), written when he was nineteen. Craven House (1926) and Twopence Coloured (1928) followed, but his first real success was the play Rope (1929, known as Rope's End in America). The Midnight Bell (1929) is based upon Hamilton's falling in love with a prostitute and was later published along with The Siege of Pleasure (1932) and The Plains of Cement (1934) as the semi-autobiographical trilogy Twenty Thousand Streets Under the Sky (1935). Ingrid Bergman in the 1944 film Gaslight Hamilton disliked many aspects of modern life. He was disfigured badly when he was run over by a car in the late 1920s:Michael Holroyd, in his introduction to the 2010 Vintage edition, says that this accident took place in January 1932 when Hamilton was walking with his wife and sister along Earls Court Road the end of his novel Mr. Stimpson and Mr. Gorse (1953), with its vision of England smothered in metal beetles, reflects his loathing of the motor car. However, despite some distaste for the culture in which he operated, he was a popular contributor to it. His two most successful plays, Rope and Gas Light (1938, known as Angel Street in the US), made Hamilton wealthy and were also successful as films: the British-made Gaslight (1940), the 1944 American adaptation of Gaslight, and Alfred Hitchcock's Rope (1948). Hangover Square (1941) is often judged his most accomplished work and still sells well in paperback, and is regarded by contemporary authors such as Iain Sinclair and Peter Ackroyd as an important part of the tradition of London novels. Set in Earls Court where Hamilton himself lived, it deals with both alcohol-drinking practices of the time and the underlying political context, such as the rise of fascism and responses to it. Hamilton became an avowed Marxist, though not a publicly declared member of the Communist Party. During the 1930s, like many other authors, Hamilton grew increasingly angry with capitalism and believed that the violence and fascism of Europe during the period indicated that capitalism was reaching its end. This encouraged his Marxism and his novel Impromptu in Moribundia (1939) was a satirical attack on capitalist culture. During his later life, Hamilton developed in his writing a misanthropic authorial voice which became more disillusioned, cynical and bleak as time passed. The Slaves of Solitude (1947) was his only work to deal directly with the Second World War and he preferred to look back to the pre-war years. His Gorse Trilogy – three novels about a devious sexual predator and conman – are not generally well thought of critically, although Graham Greene said that the first was 'the best book written about Brighton' and the second (Mr. Stimpson and Mr. Gorse) is regarded increasingly as a comic masterpiece. The hostility and negativity of the novels is also attributed to Hamilton's disenchantment with the utopianism of Marxism and his mental depression. The trilogy comprises: The West Pier (1952); Mr. Stimpson and Mr. Gorse (1953), dramatized as The Charmer in 1987; and in 1955 Hamilton's last published work, Unknown Assailant, a short novel much of which was dictated while Hamilton was drunk. The Gorse Trilogy was first published in a single volume in 1992. Hamilton had begun to consume alcohol excessively while still a relatively young man. After a declining career and melancholia, he died in 1962 of cirrhosis of the liver and kidney failure, in Sheringham, Norfolk. He was married twice, firstly to Lois Marie Martin in 1930, and a year after divorcing Lois, to Lady Ursula Chetwynd-Talbot in 1954. A small collection of Hamilton's manuscripts and correspondence can be found at the Harry Ransom Center at the University of Texas at Austin. ==Bibliography== ===Novels=== * Monday Morning (1925) * Craven House (1926, revised edition 1943) * Twopence Coloured (1928) * The Midnight Bell (1929) * The Siege of Pleasure (1932) * The Plains of Cement (1934) * Twenty Thousand Streets Under the Sky (1935 – trilogy of The Midnight Bell, The Siege of Pleasure and The Plains of Cement) * Impromptu in Moribundia (1939) * Hangover Square (1941) * The Slaves of Solitude (1947) * The West Pier (1952) * Mr Stimpson and Mr Gorse (1953) * Unknown Assailant (1955) ==Stage plays== * Rope (1929) * The Procurator of Judea (1930; unpublished) * John Brown's Body (1931; unpublished) * Gas Light (1938), also known as Angel Street * The Duke in Darkness (1943) * The Governess (1946; unpublished) * Caller Anonymous (1952; unpublished) * The Man Upstairs (1953) * Miss Roach (1958; unpublished) * Hangover Square (1965; unpublished) ==Radio plays== * Rope.

He worked as a war correspondent for RTVE and was a war correspondent for 21 years (1973–1994). His first novel, El húsar, set in the Napoleonic Wars, was released in 1986. He is well known outside Spain for his \\"Alatriste\\" series of novels. He is now a member of the Royal Spanish Academy, a position he has held since 12 June 2003. ==Writing== Pérez- Reverte's novels are usually centered on one strongly defined character, and his plots move along swiftly, often featuring a narrator who is part of the story but apart from it. Most of his novels take place in Spain or around the Mediterranean, and often draw on numerous references to Spanish history, colonial past, art and culture, ancient treasures and the sea. The novels frequently deal with some of the major issues of modern Spain such as drug trafficking or the relationship of religion and politics. Often, Pérez- Reverte's novels have two plots running in parallel with very little connection between them except for shared characters. For example, in The Club Dumas, the protagonist is searching the world for a lost book and keeps meeting people who parallel figures from Dumas novels; the movie made from it, The Ninth Gate, did not feature the Dumas connection with no loss of narrative momentum. In The Flanders Panel, a contemporary serial killer is juxtaposed with the mystery of a 500-year-old assassination. In his often polemical newspaper columns and the main characters of his novels, Pérez-Reverte often displays pessimism about human behaviour, shaped by his wartime experiences in places like El Salvador, Croatia or Bosnia and his research for crime shows. Throughout his career, and especially in its latter half, he has been notorious for cultivating his now trademark maverick, non-partisan and at times abrasive persona. This has occasionally been a source of conflict with other journalists and writers. He originally refused to have his novels translated from the original Spanish to any language other than French. However, English translations were eventually made available for some of his works, and most of his work is also available in Portuguese and Polish. Pérez- Reverte was elected to seat T of the Real Academia Española on 23 January 2003 and took up his seat on 12 June the same year. === Awards and recognition === *The Painter of Battles was the winner of the 2008 Premio Gregor von Rezzori award for foreign fiction translated into Italian. *In 2016 Pérez-Reverte was named as one of the 10 most important writers of the year by the Spanish national newspaper ABC, alongside novelists including Eduardo Mendoza and Andrés Pascual. ==Personal life== Sherry barrel signed by Pérez-Reverte Pérez- Reverte started his journalistic career writing for the now-defunct newspaper Pueblo and then for Televisión Española (the Spanish state-owned television broadcaster), often as a war correspondent. Becoming weary of the internal affairs at TVE, he resigned as a journalist and decided to work full-time as a writer. His teenage daughter Carlota was billed as a co-author of his first Alatriste novel. He lives between La Navata (near Madrid) and his native Cartagena, from where he enjoys sailing solo in the Mediterranean. He is a friend of Javier Marías, who presented Pérez-Reverte with the title of Duke of Corso of the Kingdom of Redonda micro nation. His nephew Arturo Juan Pérez- Reverte is a professional footballer playing for FC Cartagena. ==Controversies== Mexican novelist Verónica Murguía accused Arturo Pérez- Reverte of plagiarizing her work. On 10 November 1997 Murguía published a short story, titled \\"Historia de Sami\\", in the magazine El laberinto urbano. Months later, in March 1998, Pérez-Reverte published a story in El Semanal, with the title \\"Un chucho mejicano\\", bearing close similarities in narration, chronology, phrases, and in the anecdote. Pérez-Reverte's story was recently republished in a re-compilation for the text \\"Perros e hijos de perra\\" (Alfaguara), and it was then that Murguía noticed the plagiarism. Murguía would not proceed with a legal case but asked for an apology and the removal of the story from his text. Meanwhile, Pérez-Reverte apologized and noted that the story he published he wrote exactly as it was told to him by writer Sealtiel Alatriste. Pérez-Reverte's script for the film Gitano in the late 1990s also brought a case of plagiarism against the author. In May 2011 the Audiencia Provincial of Madrid ordered Pérez-Reverte and Manuel Palacios, director and co-writer of Gitano, to pay 80,000 euros to filmmaker Antonio González-Vigil, who had sued them for alleged plagiarism of the film's script, a decision Pérez-Reverte described as \\"a clear ambush\\" and a \\"clear manoeuvre to extort money.\\" The ruling contradicted two previous criminal rulings and one from a merchant judiciary which had supported Pérez-Reverte and Palacios. In July 2013 the Audiencia Provincial of Madrid ordered Pérez-Reverte to pay 200,000 euros to González-Vigil for plagiarism. == Bibliography == ===Captain Alatriste novels=== * El capitán Alatriste (1996; tr: Captain Alatriste, Plume 2005, ), presenting the character of a swordsman in the Spanish Golden Century. * Limpieza de sangre (1997; tr: Purity of Blood), about the \\"purity of blood\\" demanded from Conversos. * El sol de Breda (1998; tr: The Sun over Breda), about the war in the Spanish Netherlands – specifically, the Siege of Breda. * El oro del rey (2000; tr: The King's Gold), about the Spanish treasure fleet. * El caballero del jubón amarillo (2003; tr: The Cavalier in the Yellow Doublet).

It is east of the Owens Valley and the Sierra Nevada mountain range, and south of Fish Lake Valley, Nevada, near the California- Nevada state border. California State Route 168 connects it to the Owens and Fish Lake valleys, crossing Westgard Pass to the west and Gilbert Pass to the north. To the northwest lies White Mountain Peak. To the east lies Eureka Valley, connected via Soldier Pass in the Piper Mountain Wilderness, which can be traversed on horseback but not by automobile. ==Geography== Deep Springs Lake from the northwest. Deep Springs Lake is a playa, a seasonal salt lake, generally drying in the summer to produce a salt pan, with surface water replenished in late spring with flows from nearby springs and snowmelt that travels the length of the valley from Wyman and Crooked creeks, which enter from the north. Birds, and birdwatchers, flock to the Lake during the spring and fall migrations. Surrounding the lake are numerous springs, some artesian, which gave the valley its name. The springs are home to the Deep Springs Black Toad (Bufo exsul, or \\"exile toad\\"), an endemic species that occurs only in Deep Springs Valley. Although the population in Antelope Springs was once thought to be introduced, a genetics study published in 2009 found that there was not strong similarity to the perceived source population and this population likely occurs naturally. The population of toads, however, appears to be stable, despite the presence of cattle that graze around the lake during the winter and spring. ==Geology== On the hillsides of the southwestern end of the valley, lie the Poleta Folds, a distinctly visible example of crustal folding frequently studied by geology students from the University of California and California State University educational systems. The intensely folded and clearly visible layers comprise the Cambrian-aged Poleta formation. Several complex fault systems add to the challenge for geology students to unravel the area's history. The Poleta Folds field area is revered as one of the most complexly folded and faulted areas in California and has been used by generations of undergraduate-level geology students around the United States and Canada. During a typical summer one can often find near-established trails leading to the best outcrops. Also easily visible at the base of the Inyo Mountains, in the southwestern end of the valley behind Deep Springs Lake, is a sizable dip-slip fault. Researchers showed that the most recent fault scarp had an average displacement of along a section of the fault. With an estimated rupture area of 345 km2, the event was calculated to have a moment magnitude of 7.0 and was estimated to have occurred about 1,800 years ago. The fault is still active, but studies suggest that it slips about every 4000 years. Deep Springs Lake is at . At 4905 elevation, the lake is intermittently filled and actively precipitating dolomite, understood to rarely occur in such conditions. ==Population== It is the home of Deep Springs College, a nontraditional two-year liberal arts institution. There are also ruins of an early small mining establishment, White Mountain City, in the northwest corner of the valley. ==See also== * Eureka Valley, Inyo County * Eureka Valley Sand Dunes * Swallenia * Oenothera californica * Category: Flora of the California desert regions ==References== ==External links== * – populated place () Category:Valleys of the Mojave Desert Category:Valleys of Inyo County, California Category:Saline lakes of the United States Category:Salt flats of California Category:Inyo Mountains Category:White Mountains (California) Category:Valleys of California ","title":"Deep Springs Valley"},{"id":"1283569","text":"South Down may refer to: * South Down (Assembly constituency), for the Northern Ireland Assembly * South Down (Northern Ireland Parliament constituency) * South Down (UK Parliament constituency) * South Down GAA, hurling team ==See also== * Southdown (disambiguation) * South Downs, England * Down south (disambiguation) ","title":"South Down"},{"id":"1283570","text":"Scenic view of Al Rihan, South Governorate South Governorate (; transliterated: al-Janub) is one of the governorates of Lebanon.

Pratt was also a committed active Unitarian, and a philanthropist. He is best known for his donations to establish the Enoch Pratt Free Library in Baltimore and expanding the former Sheppard Asylum to become The Sheppard and Enoch Pratt Hospital, (now known as the Sheppard-Pratt Hospital for mental health and psychiatric research), located north of the city in western Towson, county seat of Baltimore County. Born and raised in Massachusetts, he moved south to the Chesapeake Bay area and became devoted to the civic interests of the city of Baltimore. He earned his fortune as an owner of business interests beginning in the 1830s originally as a hardware wholesaler, and later expanding into railroads, banking and finance, iron works, and steamship lines and other transportation companies. ==Early life== Born in Middleborough, Massachusetts, Enoch Pratt was the second of eight children born to Isaac and Naomi (née Keith) Pratt. A successful businessman, Isaac Pratt managed several businesses, including a sawmill, general store, wholesale hardware. The young Enoch was educated at the former Bridgewater Academy in the neighboring town of Bridgewater, Massachusetts's Town Common. After graduating, at the age of 15, Enoch Pratt began his first job in business as a clerk in a Boston hardware establishment. In 1831, Pratt moved to Baltimore with $150 to launch his own wholesale iron hardware business, Enoch Pratt & Brothers at 23-25 South Charles Street, between East Baltimore and German (now Redwood) Streets. The business proved successful, and six years later, Pratt married Maria Louisa Hyde (1818–1913), the daughter of Samuel G. and Catherine Hyde, whom he met at his church on August 1, 1837. Their marriage was happy, but they were unable to have children. ==Business career== With his successful hardware business, Pratt became involved in other businesses as vice president of the Philadelphia, Wilmington, and Baltimore Railroad, who built their southern terminal in 1849-1850 at the President Street Station, at President and Fleet Streets, east of the harbor \\"basin\\" (today's Inner Harbor). He also served as president of the National Farmers’ and Planters’ Bank of Baltimore, and was the controlling stockholder in the Maryland Steamboat Company. In 1851, Pratt and his partner invested in western Maryland coal mines and iron yards in the expanding and developing industrial and commercial Baltimore neighborhood of Canton. They made their own merchandise, thereby ending their dependence on northern manufacturers. From 1860 until his death in 1896, he was the president of the National Farmers' and Planters' Bank of Baltimore. Pratt also became president of the Baltimore Clearing House and the Maryland Bankers' Association, in addition to establishing a role in several transportation companies. He was also a director for three other railroads, including the famous Baltimore and Ohio Railroad. He was a contemporary and associate of philanthropist Thomas Kelso, (1784-1878), founder and endower of the Kelso Home and Orphan Asylum originally established by his home at No. 87 East Baltimore Street and opened January 1, 1874, who also endowed many local charities associated with the national denomination and the local Baltimore Annual Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church. They served together on the board of the P.W. & B. Railroad Company.American railroad journal - Volume 27, J.H. Schultz, 1854, pg. 62 ==Philanthropy== During his early years as a businessman, Pratt's philanthropy started with donations to his church, the First Independent Church of Baltimore (later the First Unitarian Church (Unitarian and Universalist), at North Charles and West Franklin Streets, where he served as a trustee for over 40 years.The Philanthropy Hall of Fame, Enoch Pratt He paid off several of the congregation's large debts, bought a new organ, and financed significant remodeling of the church in the 1890s. Other early philanthropy included his patronage of the artist Edward Sheffield Bartholomew, Pratt commissioned many public sculptures and memorials throughout Baltimore, including the statue of George Washington erected in the city's new first and largest park of Druid Hill Park, acquired by the city in 1860, and laid out by famed landscape architect Frederick Law Olmsted. Pratt gave much of his time and wealth to Baltimore’s cultural and charitable institutions. He served as a trustee of the Peabody Institute, founded in 1857, which began construction in 1860 and opened/dedicated in 1866, in the presence of its benefactor, fellow Bay Stater and friend, George Peabody, (1795-1869), who also formerly made his original fortune in \\"The Monumental City\\" during the 20 years of his first business, 1815-1835, at the time was the wealthiest man in the Americas. The new Institute's various cultural programs that were to be established of an art gallery, reference library, series of educational lectures, a music conservatory, and system of scholarship honors (engrossed certificates and monetary prizes with gold or silver medals) for honored graduates of the city's new public high schools (\\"Peabody Prizes\\"), which were continued for 130 years. A decade later, nine years after his death, the east wing of the Institute with its noted gallery of cast-iron balconies for the book stacks, ceiling skylight and impressive architecture by Edmund G. Lind for its scholarly, non-circulating reference library, (now known as The George Peabody Library) was completed in 1878, and was one of the reasons that the first President Daniel Coit Gilman of the new Johns Hopkins University opening in February 1876, temporarily located its first campus a few blocks away on North Howard Street, rather than at Hopkins' summer/country estate of \\"Clifton\\" in northeast Baltimore. These acts of generous philanthropy further inspired Pratt, by his friend and fellow Massachusetts-born and Baltimore industrialist/financier George Peabody, [1795-1869], who earned his fortune beginning during his earlier twenty years in the city during 1815-1835 and his other friend and fellow merchant Johns Hopkins, (1795-1873). He founded the \\"House of Reformation and Instruction for Colored Children\\" which he offered on his former farm property at Cheltenham (in Prince George's County), and the Maryland School for the Deaf and Dumb located at Frederick on South Market Street. In 1865, he donated a free school and public library (The Pratt Free School in 1856, and further endowed upon its 1865 incorporation - which later became a public grammar school preparing students for advancement to the local Middleborough High School, founded 1873), to his hometown of Middleborough in Massachusetts. ===Enoch Pratt Free Library=== The interior of the Enoch Pratt Free Library Pratt is best known for his establishment of the Enoch Pratt Free Library in Baltimore. Many residents of the city in late 1881 speculated what was being planned for the excavations going on in the north side of West Mulberry Street, by Cathedral Street, near the old Baltimore Cathedral in the tony Mount Vernon-Belvedere- Mount Royal neighborhood, north of the business district on Cathedral Hill. The mystery was explained when on January 21, 1882, in a letter addressed to the Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, Pratt offered a gift of a central library, four branch libraries (with two additional ones to be constructed shortly thereafter), and a financial endowment of (U.S.) $1,058,333. Further, he requested that to Mayor William Pinkney Whyte and the Council continue an annual appropriation to the new library system and support it in the years to come to supplement the interest and benefits accumulating from the principal of his bequest. His intention was to establish a library that \\"shall be for all, rich and poor without distinction of race or color, who, when properly accredited, can take out the books if they will handle them carefully and return them.\\" The grant was accepted by the municipal government, approved by the General Assembly of Maryland with some enabling legislation, and approved by the city voters later that year in an election/referendum on October 25, 1882. After four years of plans, construction and the hiring of staff with the purchasing of many books, the new library was ready to be opened in January 1886 with some appropriate addresses at ceremonies at the nearby luxurious auditorium of the Academy of Music on North Howard Street (between West Centre and West Franklin Streets), and opened to new patrons and business at the beginning of February 1886. ===Sheppard Asylum=== Upon his death in 1896 at his summer residence \\"Tivoli\\" (of Italianate style which he bought in 1870) off Woodbourne Avenue in northeast Baltimore, Pratt left the vast majority of his wealth ($2 million of his $2.5 million) to supplement the earlier endowment of The Sheppard and Enoch Pratt Hospital, (as it was later renamed, today it is titled \\"Sheppard Pratt Health System,\\" giving equal weight to both generous co-founders). Pratt was impressed by the trustees' frugal handling of the original founder's - Moses Sheppard, (1771/1773?-1857), endowment from 1857. “They are the only Board of Trustees in Baltimore,” said Pratt, “who have carried out exactly the directions of the founder.” Pratt's bequest was used to complete construction of the old Moses Sheppard Asylum, enlarge the facility to house 200 additional patients at its country campus in western Towson, further north of the city off (North) Charles Street Avenue in suburban Baltimore County, at the old \\"Mount Airy Farm\\" of Baltimore merchant Thomas Poultney, which they purchased in 1858 and began construction two years later, however not opening until 1891, trying to remain faithful to the original directions to serve the indigent. ==Enoch Pratt Mansion / Maryland Historical Society== Enoch Pratt's city townhouse/mansion located at 201 West Monument Street (southwest corner with Park Avenue in Mount Vernon-Belvedere, purchased in 1847). The Pratt mansion was occupied by his wife Maria Louisa Hyde Pratt until her death in 1913. In 1919, the West Monument Street townhouse/mansion was gifted to the Historical Society by Mary Washington Keyser, whose husband was a longtime Md.H.S. member. A research library, archives, and underground storage stacks were constructed in the following decade at the southern rear of the mansion replacing the former carriage house. ==Legacy== Famous Scottish-born steel industrialist, millionaire, and noted philanthropist Andrew Carnegie (1835-1919) said that \\"Pratt was my guide and inspiration\\" remembering the time of several days that he spent in Baltimore at Pratt's house on West Monument Street, touring the new Free Library and conversing with Pratt and his employees and even the citizens/patrons about their mutual ideas during his visit in March 1890. ==References== Category:1808 births Category:1896 deaths Category:Philanthropists from Massachusetts Category:American Unitarians Category:Businesspeople from Baltimore Category:People from Middleborough, Massachusetts Category:19th-century philanthropists ","title":"Enoch Pratt"},{"id":"1283602","text":"Herbert David Croly (January 23, 1869 – May 17, 1930) was an intellectual leader of the progressive movement as an editor, political philosopher and a co-founder of the magazine The New Republic in early twentieth-century America. His political philosophy influenced many leading progressives including Theodore Roosevelt, Adolph Berle, as well as his close friends Judge Learned Hand and Supreme Court Justice Felix Frankfurter. His 1909 book The Promise of American Life looked to the constitutional liberalism as espoused by Alexander Hamilton, combined with the radical democracy of Thomas Jefferson. The book influenced contemporaneous progressive thought, shaping the ideas of many intellectuals and political leaders, including then ex- President Theodore Roosevelt. Calling themselves \\"The New Nationalists\\", Croly and Walter Weyl sought to remedy the relatively weak national institutions with a strong federal government. He promoted a strong army and navy and attacked pacifists who thought democracy at home and peace abroad was best served by keeping America weak. Croly was one of the founders of modern liberalism in the United States, especially through his books, essays and a highly influential magazine founded in 1914, The New Republic. In his 1914 book Progressive Democracy, Croly rejected the thesis that the liberal tradition in the United States was inhospitable to anti-capitalist alternatives. He drew from the American past a history of resistance to capitalist wage relations that was fundamentally liberal, and he reclaimed an idea that progressives had allowed to lapse—that working for wages was a lesser form of liberty. Increasingly skeptical of the capacity of social welfare legislation to remedy social ills, Croly argued that America's liberal promise could be redeemed only by syndicalist reforms involving workplace democracy. His liberal goals were part of his commitment to American republicanism. ==Family== Herbert Croly was born in Manhattan, New York City in 1869 to journalists Jane Cunningham Croly—better known by her pseudonym \\"Jenny June\\"—and David Goodman Croly. Jane Croly was a contributor to The New York Times, The Messenger, and The New York World. She was the editor of Demorest's Illustrated Monthly for 27 years. Jane Croly wrote only on the subject of women and published nine books in addition to her work as a journalist. She was one of the best-known women in America when Herbert Croly was born. David Croly worked as a reporter for the Evening Post and The New York Herald, as well as the editor of The New York World for 12 years. He was also a noted pamphleteer during Abraham Lincoln's presidency. Herbert Croly married Louise Emory on May 30, 1892. They remained married until Herbert Croly's death in 1930. They had no children. ==Education== Croly attended the City College of New York for one year and entered Harvard College in 1886. David Croly soon became concerned that his son was being exposed to improper philosophical material at Harvard. The father was a follower of Auguste Comte and discouraged Herbert from studying theology and philosophers that did not agree with Comte. During Herbert’s first two years at Harvard, David became gravely ill, and in 1888 Herbert dropped out of Harvard to become his father’s private secretary and companion. His father died on April 29, 1889. After Herbert married Louise Emory in 1892 he re-enrolled in Harvard. But, in 1893, Herbert suffered a nervous breakdown and withdrew again from Harvard. Herbert and Louise moved to Cornish, New Hampshire, where he recovered. In 1895, Herbert enrolled for the final time at Harvard at the age of 26. He excelled in his studies until 1899, when he withdrew for the last time from Harvard for unknown reasons, without a degree. In 1910, after the publication of Herbert Croly's book The Promise of American Life, he was awarded an honorary degree by Harvard University. ==Early career== Little is known about Croly's immediate actions after he left Harvard in 1899. Historians believe he went to Paris intending to study philosophy, but by 1900 he had returned to New York City. After returning to America, Herbert Croly worked as an editor for an architectural magazine, The Architectural Record, from 1900 to 1906. === Cornish Art Colony === After Croly had first come to Cornish, a thriving art colony, he decided to build a house there, designed by Charles A. Platt, a prominent architect and friend of Croly through Croly's magazine (Architectural Record). It was typical of Platt's early style, done in an Italianate style with formal gardens and a sweeping view of Mt. Ascutney, a famous feature of many colony homes. It was in Cornish that Croly worked on a new project: The Promise of American Life, a political book he hoped would provide guidance for Americans during the transition from an agrarian to an industrialized society. When it published in 1909, Croly became a leading political thinker and prominent figure in the progressive movement. In addition to Platt, Croly was good friends with judge Learned Hand, whose family vacationed in Cornish at their estate \\"Low Court\\", and Louis Shipman, a Harvard classmate and playwright who accompanied Croly on his first visit to the colony. Shipman and his wife Ellen had a home in the neighboring town of Plainfield. It is near there that Croly and the Shipmans are buried, in the Gilkey Cemetery just north of the village. ==The Promise of American Life== In The Promise of American Life, Herbert Croly set out his argument for a progressive-liberal government in twentieth-century America. He saw democracy as the defining American trait and described democracy not as a government devoted to equal rights but as one with the aim of “bestowing a share of the responsibility and the benefits, derived from political economic association, upon the whole community.” He returned to Thomas Jefferson and Alexander Hamilton as representatives of the two main schools of American political thought. Croly famously admitted, “I shall not disguise the fact that on the whole my own preferences are on the side of Hamilton rather than of Jefferson.” Despite his preference for Hamilton, Croly believed there were some good aspects about Jefferson’s philosophy on government. He wrote, \\"Jefferson was filled with a sincere, indiscriminate, and unlimited faith in the American people.\\" However, Croly viewed Jeffersonian democracy as \\"tantamount to extreme individualism\\", suitable only for pre-Civil War America when the ideal Americans were pioneers pursuing individual wealth. Croly's largest contribution to American political thought was to synthesize the two thinkers into one theory on government: Jefferson’s strong democracy achieved through Hamilton’s strong national government. ===Economy=== Croly argued that when America shifted from an agrarian economy to an industrial one, Jefferson’s vision was no longer realistic for America. Instead, Croly turned to Alexander Hamilton’s theory of big national government. Government, according to Croly, could no longer be content with protecting negative rights; it needed to actively promote the welfare of its citizens. Croly proposed a three-pronged program: the nationalization of large corporations, the strengthening of labor unions, and a strong central government. Croly firmly believed that labor unions were “the most effective machinery which has yet been forged for the economic and social amelioration of the laboring class.” He wanted unions to have the right to negotiate contracts to ensure companies would only hire union workers. Unlike other progressives, Croly did not want the government to wage war against large corporations. He wanted the Sherman Antitrust Act repealed and replaced with a national incorporation act that would regulate and, if necessary, nationalize corporations. Croly had little sympathy for non-union workers and small businesses, declaring that “Whenever the small competitor of the large corporation is unable to keep his head above water, he should be allowed to drown.” Croly did not support economic equality or large disparities in wealth. He believed it was the responsibility of a powerful central government to practice “constructive discrimination” on behalf of the poor. Croly's plan included a federal inheritance rate of 20%, not the individual income tax that other progressive reformers wanted. Croly argued that compensation for work should be adjusted to “the needs of a normal and wholesome life”—an idea along the lines of the Utopian author Edward Bellamy. ===Rights=== Croly called for the adoption of Hamiltonian means to achieve Jeffersonian ends. To achieve this synthesis, however, Croly rejected Hamilton's arguments for institutional checks on a pure national democracy, and Jefferson's arguments for limited government. Croly rejected these limits because he saw them as too closely tied to the doctrine of individual rights. Croly wanted to transcend the doctrine of individual rights in order to create a national political community, one that would be forged by a strong but democratic national government. However, Croly failed to see the connection between Jefferson's belief in democracy and his belief in limited government, and he failed to see the connection between Hamilton's belief in a strong national government and his call for institutional checks on democracy. Thus, although many American reform movements have their roots in the rhetoric of Croly's progressivism, to be effective they have had to accommodate the principles of liberal individualism that Croly wished to eradicate. ===Croly's elite=== Croly's strong central government needed strong individuals to lead it. His ideal was Abraham Lincoln, a person who was “something of a saint and something of a hero” and understood that democracy in America was greater than \\"rights\\"; it was a national ideal. Croly, like Hamilton, had a faith in the powerful few and sincerely believed that those few would remain democratic. His search for a great American leader became an obsession that was never satisfied. Croly's notion of the elite was challenged by civil libertarians who believed Croly's powerful few would lead to a totalitarian state. In the telling of Fred Siegel of the conservative Manhattan Institute, “For Croly, businessmen and their allies – the jack-of-all-trades latter-day Jeffersonians – were blocking the path to the bright future he envisioned for the specialists of the rising professional classes.”Siegel, Fred (2013). The Revolt Against the Masses. New York: Encounter Books, p. 12. ===Criticism=== The Promise of American Life has received criticism from a number of angles. Many feared the underlying tones of totalitarianism or fascism. Croly insisted his government was nationalistic not socialistic. Even those who believed Croly's government could be democratic had concerns that Croly's vision for the country was clouded by a Republican prejudice. His writing contained several criticisms of the Democrats but almost none of the Republicans. Croly's book was also criticized for its lack of national focus. It focused almost entirely on problems that were of interest to those living in cities but not to rural America. The tariff, conservation, currency, banking, and agriculture all were only mentioned in passing, if at all. Connected to that was an argument that Croly's plans were unrealistic and detached from the reality that many Americans were living. By Croly's death in 1930, 7,500 copies of The Promise of American Life had been sold. ==After The Promise of American Life== The publication of The Promise of American Life in 1909 earned Croly a lot of publicity and the attention of some important people, including Dan Hanna, Mark Hanna’s son. From 1911 to 1912, Croly worked on a biography of Hanna: Marcus Alonzo Hanna: His Life and Work. Croly needed a source of income at the time, and Dan Hanna paid Croly to write the book but reserved the right to make changes before it was published. The book had soaring praise for Mark Hanna, a conservative who saw the role of government very differently from Croly. The Promise of American Life also attracted the attention of Roosevelt; they became friends. When Roosevelt ran for president in 1912 as a candidate for the Bull Moose party, he used the slogan \\"New Nationalism\\". There is some dispute among historians whether Roosevelt took the slogan directly from The Promise of American Life or if he had already developed the concept himself. Either way, Croly was credited at the time as the author. Croly was drawn into presidential politics during the election of 1912. Croly (representing Roosevelt) took the national stage against Louis Brandeis (representing Woodrow Wilson) on the issue of trusts. Brandeis and Wilson took the side of small business, arguing that competition and equal opportunity for small businesses was at the heart of American democracy. They painted Roosevelt as the candidate of big business, and Croly was charged with arguing that big business, when properly regulated, was better for national unity and prosperity because it was efficient without the greed he associated with small business competition. Wilson easily defeated Roosevelt and won the election. In early 1913, Croly and his wife moved to Washington, D.C. where Croly started on his next project, the book, Progressive Democracy. ==Progressive Democracy== In Progressive Democracy, published in 1915, Croly picked up where The Promise of American Life left off, shifting his focus to economic democracy and the issue of power for workers in large corporations. He wrote that his goal was to explain “the needs and requirements of a genuinely popular system of representative government.” For Croly, those needs and requirements included information on major political issues available to the public, energetic public debate and discussion, and the pursuit of a common voice in society. A main concern of Croly's in Progressive Democracy was that the United States Constitution was fundamentally inconsistent with American democratic aspirations. He perceived the Constitution as a “living Constitution,” capable in his mind of becoming something other than the Founding Fathers intended. Croly's alternative to interpreting the Constitution as “living” was to eliminate it and start over, or at least substantially alter it. The basis for his argument was the belief that for progressive democracy to be successful it needed to move quickly, and the Constitution did not accommodate that. Reforms were needed that could not wait for the approval of Congress or state legislatures. In Progressive Democracy, Croly expressed hope that reformers in 1915 were different enough from reformers of the past that they could make real differences in American politics. His call for a more progressive democracy hinged on reforming social and economic systems. He accused Woodrow Wilson's administration of returning the country to Jeffersonian individualism, the opposite of where he thought the country should be going. He ended by appealing to Americans’ cultural and social instincts to improve their situation. Rejecting both individualism and socialism, he argued that: :the \\"scientific\\" forms of both individualism and socialism rest finally on a dogmatic economic determinism, which presumes to define the laws of social causation, and whose ideal necessarily counts in the submission of the individual and social will to the conditions of the social process. The progressive democratic faith carries with it the liberation of democracy from this class of social pseudo knowledge.Progressive Democracy pp 176-77 ==The New Republic== After Woodrow Wilson won the presidential election in 1912, Harper’s Weekly became the leading magazine for Progressive party politics. Herbert Croly believed the magazine took the wrong stance on many issues and endeavored to start a magazine of his own. In 1914, Willard Straight and his wife Dorothy Payne Whitney provided the financing for Croly's magazine, The New Republic. Croly, Walter Lippmann, and Walter Weyl were the co-founders of The New Republic. The first issue appeared on November 7, 1914. TNR’s articles represented the politics of its founders, and by 1915 the journal had attracted an audience of about 15,000, mainly young intellectuals in New York. Theodore Roosevelt was the star of many early pieces in TNR, but by December 1914, Roosevelt had a falling out with Croly, Lippmann, and Weyl. The editors chastised Roosevelt for an attack on Wilson’s policy in Mexico. In retaliation, Roosevelt accused the editors of personal disloyalty and ended relations with them, becoming openly hostile toward Croly and the others. World War I presented the first real policy challenge. Though they had been criticizing various Wilsonian strategies in domestic politics, the editors were hesitant to take a strong position on the war. Croly's pragmatism set the magazine’s tone early, not blaming Germany but not openly supporting the Allies either. In the summer of 1915, TNR endorsed Norman Angell’s notion of a limited war, using techniques like seizing German assets rather than all-out war. By late 1916, Croly had come around to some of Wilson’s policies and used TNR to declare his support of Wilson in the 1916 election. However, Croly became disillusioned toward the end of World War I and finally abandoned his loyalty to Wilson in 1918. The period from 1918-1921 was difficult for TNR, and by 1921, Croly was the only original member of The New Republic that remained. Willard Straight died of influenza and pneumonia in 1918 at the age of 38, and three weeks later Randolph Bourne, a contributor to TNR from the beginning, died of the same influenza epidemic at age 32. Theodore Roosevelt died at the age of 61 only one month later, followed by Walter Weyl who died in 1919 at age 46. Walter Lippmann left the magazine in 1921 on bad terms with Croly. Around the same time, Judge Learned Hand—one of Croly's closest friends—broke off their friendship over differences between them on the Treaty of Versailles. Although the friendship somewhat healed years later, it was a devastating loss to Croly. In 1924 The New Republic filed for bankruptcy. Though it reorganized and began publishing again, the original spirit of the magazine would not return. Croly remained a contributor, however, until his death in 1930. ==Later life and death== Although Croly eventually joined calls for American involvement in World War I, he became pessimistic and frustrated by the costs of war. In late 1917 and 1918, Croly began questioning his own beliefs about nationalism and democracy. The Treaty of Versailles delivered a severe blow to Croly's progressive spirit, causing him to declare that the Paris Peace Conference was the apocalypse of liberalism. The vicious treatment of unions during the labor movements in the 1920s was difficult for Croly, a big union supporter. The issue of prohibition put Croly's beliefs about the role of the national government to the test. He ultimately adopted the policy Louis Brandeis suggested to him—that the federal government be responsible for interstate trafficking of alcohol but that states take responsibility for internal enforcement. But, for Croly, the challenge of how to handle prohibition was the final straw in breaking his faith in his old vision of democracy. In 1920, Croly worked on another book called The Breach in Civilization. It was a reflection on the role of religion in the future. The result was a compilation of the ideals Croly once held but by then believed were unrealistic positions. He wrote that legislation as a solution for social issues was unimportant, and abandoned his own core philosophy that central government could create human amelioration. He condemned progressivism as a failure. As the book was on its way to the publisher, Felix Frankfurter persuaded Croly to withdraw the manuscript. It was never published, and only part of the text remains today. Croly's steady mental and physical decline in the 1920s culminated in a massive stroke in 1928. Though he survived, movement of the right side of his body was impaired and his ability to speak was seriously affected. For 20 painful months Croly and his wife worked toward his recovery, but it was too much to overcome. Herbert Croly died on May 17, 1930, and was buried in Plainfield, New Hampshire, alongside his wife gravestone. ==New Deal== Croly died before the election of Franklin D. Roosevelt and his New Deal. However, historians commonly consider the New Deal to be a program that embodied many of Croly's most central beliefs and ideas. Whether or not Roosevelt was directly influenced by Croly's writings is debated, but many of Croly's visions for how government should operate are tenets of the New Deal. Adolph Berle, a member of the New Deal Brain Trust, was a Bull Moose Progressive and familiar with Croly's work.Indivisible Human RightsCitizens and Citoyens, by Mark Hulliung == Works == * Croly, Herbert.

MEC was formed as a Canadian consumers' co-operative to sell outdoor recreation gear and clothing exclusively to its members. MEC is notable for its commitment to environmental protection and other causes. As a co-op, MEC sells only to customers who hold a lifetime membership, which is technically a share. MEC is Canada's largest supplier of outdoor equipment. Following its founding in Vancouver, British Columbia in 1971, MEC expanded across Canada and grew to operate stores in 20 cities. Once catering to mountaineers and climbers, MEC now targets a broader, more urban clientele and is largely focused on clothing, cycling and yoga supplies. This is evidenced by changes in its marketing imagery, which historically focused on high level climbing and alpinist imagery. At its peak MEC had over 5.4 million members in Canada and internationally. Facing mounting financial loses in 2019 and during the COVID-19 epidemic, in September 2020, without consulting its membership, the board of directors of the co-operative entered into an agreement to sell its assets to an American private equity firm, Kingswood Capital Management. If the deal is completed Kingswood will continue to operate the former member-owned coop as a private, for-profit business. ==Organization== The MEC store in Ottawa MEC operates twenty-two retail stores and a \\"Corporate & Group Sales\\" store for large orders. Some MEC stores incorporate eco-friendly designs. The Ottawa and Winnipeg stores were the first and second retail buildings in Canada to comply with Canada's C2000 Green Building Standard, which acknowledges buildings that achieve energy consumption 50% less than similar conventional structures. The organization designs and produces a significant proportion of its retail products and also carries other well-known brands. A significant proportion of the company's inventory is manufactured in Asia, with names and addresses of partner- factories made publicly available on the co-op's website. MECs' stated aim is to inspire and enable people to lead active, outdoor lifestyles. They accomplish this by selling outdoor gear, clothing and services. MEC's head office and telephone service centre are located in Vancouver. Its distribution centres are located in Brampton, Ontario and Surrey, British Columbia. ==Governance== Chris Strashok, the author of an academic study, remarked in 2011 that \\"currently there are 3.3 million member owners making MEC the fourth largest democratic entity in Canada, after the governments of Canada, Ontario and Québec.\\" Each year, every member of MEC has the opportunity to vote in the elections for its board of directors, as well as on \\"special resolutions\\", through a variety of methods. Before the election period, an information package with platforms of candidates and information on resolutions is distributed. Election results are announced at the annual general meeting. MEC is governed by a nine-member board of directors. Each year, three directors are elected to three-year terms. MEC holds its annual general meeting in Vancouver, BC. At this meeting, the Chief Executive Officer and Committee members deliver their annual reports, and answer questions from co-op members. \\"Other resolutions\\" may also be brought forward and voted upon. The AGM is typically webcast and members can log in and ask questions. Typically, members recite their member numbers before speaking and these numbers are recorded in the official meeting transcript. ===Co-op structure=== Strashok remarked in 2011 that, \\"profits are either shared among member owners based on how much the member uses the co-operative or invested back into the co-operative to improve the services provided to the members, and to sustain the business. Because of this, MEC is financially conservative, growing slowly and taking few risks. This can be challenging when the business is moving through different stages of growth. It does, however, create space for creative solutions and capital remains local benefiting the communities in which MEC operates.\\" While the democratic structure gave one vote to one member, the financial structure and \\"policies and legislation pertaining to business in Canada, such as how capital is classified, the classification of dividends versus patronage payments, and tax incentives for investing in co-operatives\\" were, as noted by Strashok, ill-studied by Canadian business schools. These profits were returned to members as the patronage dividend or patronage return that can be found in yearly financial statements. For the purposes of governance and direction at the AGM the policy was one member, one vote, regardless of how much share capital had been earned by any particular member. Share redemptions were carried out, for example through gift cards, and may have required a policy affirmation. Thus MEC found a means of treating each member as equal, regardless of purchases and shares earned. In 2020 the 5.7 million members had a paid-up capital of $192 million, well above the $5 initiation fee per member. This capital was reinvested in things like stock of merchandise and expansion of the retail empire. ===Purposes and objectives=== The purposes of the Co-op were from the outset closely intertwined with its governance model. In 2008, the commonweal of the Co-op was measured by Ponto according to Anielski's Genuine Wealth model, while in 2011 Strashok produced a case study that focused on its promotion of sustainable development. The governance model was altered significantly from 2011, to change MEC's focus to a more traditional accounting and retail-based business model. ===Environmental and social initiatives=== MEC has undertaken initiatives in the field of social and environmental responsibility, including: * MEC was the first Canadian retailer to publicly disclose its list of factories and their locations, and updates this list annually. * In May 2007 MEC became a member. MEC committed to the goal of sourcing 100% Bluesign approved fabrics by 2020. In 2019, 88% of MEC apparel and sleeping bag materials were Bluesign certified. Bluesign is a third party environmental, health and safety standard for the textiles industry. * MEC committed to using 100% organic cotton for all MEC-branded apparel and sets yearly targets to increase its offering of products made from recycled materials. * MEC promotes a variety of outdoor education opportunities to its members by an online calendar of events. * In December 2007, MEC became the first retailer in Canada to stop selling water bottles and food containers containing bisphenol A, a chemical that is used to make some plastics and has been linked in some studies to increased incidence of cancer and other diseases. * In 2008, MEC eliminated all single-use shopping bags from its stores. * In 2010 MEC launched a new green building initiative called MEC GBS (Green Building Systems). The aim of the initiative was to ensure MEC leaders in building and operating environmentally-friendly facilities. Its Winnipeg, Longueuil, Burlington and North Vancouver stores, as well as its Montreal office received LEED Gold ratings. Its Winnipeg, Montreal and Ottawa stores also comply with C2000 standards (Natural Resources Canada’s Advanced Commercial Buildings Program). * In March 2018, MEC announced that it would no longer stock products made by Vista Outdoor, in response to the 2018 NRA boycott, in the wake of the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting, because some of Vista Outdoor's profits are derived from the production of assault weapons. ===Business initiatives=== The organization has engaged in several business initiatives: * In 1997 MEC introduced a free of charge online gear swap where members can trade used outdoor gear. *MEC's distribution centre in Surrey British Columbia was opened in the fall of 2007 and was the first \\"Green\\" LEED (Silver) accredited distribution centre in North America. *In November 2008 MEC opened bicycle repair shops in Vancouver, Calgary, Toronto and Montreal stores. The Winnipeg and Burlington stores opened their repair shops in March 2009. , sixteen stores have bike servicing. *In the summer of 2008 MEC launched a series of annual national paddling and biking expositions named \\"MEC Paddlefest\\" and \\"MEC Bikefest\\". ===Leadership=== ====CEO==== * Bill Gibson 1992-2000 * Peter Robinson 2000-2007 * David Labistour 2007-2019 * Philippe Arrata 2019-2020 ====Board chair==== * Chris McNeil * Anders Ourom * Denise Lawson (2009-2012) * Bill Gibson (2011-2014) * Margie Parikh (2014-2016) * Ellen Pekeles (2017-2018) * Judi Richardson ==History== In 1971, four members of the University of British Columbia Varsity Outdoor Club conceived the idea of a mountain climbing equipment co-op when a snowstorm stranded them on Mount Baker in Washington state. Prior to this they had been purchasing gear at REI in Seattle. Other Varsity Outdoor Club members joined the plan and MEC was formed. The organization was incorporated under the British Columbia Co-operative Associations Act, with a constitution that was originally written by co-founder Jim Byers. ===1972-2000=== The MEC's first physical store was opened in 1972 on West Hastings Street in Vancouver. By 1981, it had opened a store in Calgary and had 57,000 members. MEC established its third retail location in Toronto, in 1985. By 1992, MEC's sales had increased to more than $35-million and had 330,000 members. Hudson's Bay Company executive Bill Gibson was hired from outside the organization and within a few years he had opened stores in Ottawa and Edmonton. ===2000-2015=== Former MEC store in Edmonton Peter Robinson was CEO from 2000 to 2007, until he was replaced by David Labistour in 2007. Gibson moved to the board in 2000 for a dozen years, which he chaired between 2009 and 2012. Serratus Mountain Products Ltd. and \\"the following substantially inactive companies\\": 330204 British Columbia Ltd., 340070 British Columbia Ltd. and 1314625 Ontario Limited were as of December 29, 2002 wholly owned subsidiaries of MEC. ====Festivals==== In 2006 MEC began a national program of outdoor \\"festivals\\" in every city in Canada that the organization had a store. MEC Paddlefest was the first of these, followed in 2008 by MEC Bikefest, which was initially run in six cities and later expanded. MEC launched its third festival, MEC Snowfest, in all MEC store cities during the winter of 2011. ====Expanded product lines==== From 2009 to 2011 MEC expanded its traditional back-country products to include urban outdoor pursuits. Road running, bicycles and yoga apparel were introduced and became significant components of MEC's marketing focus. In November 2009, MEC entered the bicycle retail market. This move was resisted by some suppliers of bicycle components, who refused to ship to MEC. One Quebec distributor ceased doing business with a bicycle manufacturer when that company decided to supply MEC. At that time, MEC had 11 retail outlets and about $265 million in sales. The CEO of MEC remarked that the industry had been given two years' notice about MEC's plans to enter the bicycle market. For its initial bicycles offered, MEC contracted with a Taiwanese manufacturer to build a bicycle line under MEC's own brand. MEC planned to sell $4 million worth of bicycles in its first year. In November 2009 MEC began selling MEC-branded bikes in seven stores: Vancouver, Calgary, Winnipeg, Burlington, Toronto, Montreal and Longueuil. In 2015, MEC offered 58 different models including road bikes, mountain bikes, hybrid and urban bikes. Some models are designed specifically for women or children. In 2012 MEC also began selling a selection of Ghost Bikes, in late 2013 added Ridley Bikes who made the choice to bet on the success of MEC instead of existing distributor Live To Play Sports, and Intense Bicycles in early 2017. ====Business model opposition==== In November 2010, as the MEC petitioned North Vancouver for permission to re-zone a property for expansion of its retail operation there, Jayson Faulkner, a competitor who owned Escape Route, took issue with the income tax rules under which the MEC was able to \\"amass hundreds of millions of dollars in patronage dividends that were never taxed or paid out to members, thus creating a huge pool of cash to fund its dramatic expansion.\\" Faulkner wrote that \\"MEC is able to generate working capital at 10x the rate of all its competitors... MEC is absolutely no different than any other very large corporation operating in Canada. They are an aggressive, predatory competitor who will do whatever it takes to ensure they continue to grow and eat up market share, which is already 70-80% in some product categories... They have in the past and present, undertaken decisions and policies that will aggressively protect their own interests. “Lead pipe” capitalism is alive and well at MEC.\\" The petition succeeded. ====Rebranding==== In 2012, when MEC had 15 stores, its marketing name was changed from Mountain Equipment Co-op to just MEC, to reflect the changed focus of the organization. On 18 June 2013, Mountain Equipment rebranded their logo, replacing the twin mountain peaks with a green square containing the text \\"MEC\\" in bold. In 2013 the \\"earnings before patronage return and income taxes\\" was $10 million, and in 2014 was $8 million, on sales that year of $336 million; cost of sales was $226 million and cost of administration was $105 million. ====Board governance changes==== Over the four-year period to 2011–2015, the board of directors made it increasingly difficult for members lacking specific educational and experience qualifications to run for board membership. Former board chairman Anders Ourom, who had been a member of the MEC board for nine years, was even disqualified for election in 2012, as unqualified. Former board chairman Chris McNeil, who had served on the board for 20 years, said, \\"if there are too many people with sophisticated backgrounds, they will have a mindset or bias there because of the type of person you're asking for.\\" MEC co-founder Jim Byers, observed, \\"they've become captured by the very retail structures that we fought against.\\" Governance consultant Mark Latham said, \\"I don't think members' interests are well protected by the governance as it is now.\\" By this time the board was able disqualify board candidates and disregard member resolutions it disliked. In 2013, \\"the board required that director candidates have board or senior management experience 'in a complex organization'. For the 2016 election, the board requires directors to have that experience 'in an organization of comparable complexity to MEC'.\\" MEC CEO David Labistour said that pre- selection of board candidates \\"offers [the] membership an informed election\\" that is both transparent and \\"in line with the health of the organization.\\" Concurrently, the board was given a hefty pay raise. In 2015, the chair made more than $58,000, as compared to 2011 when he was compensated $30,500. Democratic remedies available to MEC members were curtailed during the same period. In 2013, \\"the board increased the number of signatures required to get a motion placed before the membership to 500 from five\\" It was noted that \\"now, even if a special resolution has the required number of signatures, the board can still refuse to put it on the ballot if two-thirds of directors are opposed.\\" In 2015, MEC had 18 stores and had sales of $336 million. Its product lineup was broadened to include \\"more mainstream items such as road running shoes and downhill skis\\", and it aimed to better serve a \\"younger, more multicultural and female\\" clientele. CEO Labistour observed that the values of the \\"white Anglo-Saxon male\\" were being obliterated and, to cope with the changed circumstances of the Canadian retail environment, he changed the mission of the organization. As of 2014 year end, subsidiary 1314625 Ontario Limited was \\"substantially inactive\\" according to the audit firm of KPMG. ===2015-2019=== A change in mission occurred while Bill Gibson was MEC's board chair, as the co-op incorporated urban pursuits like road running, cycling and yoga into the product line. By 2015, products also included downhill skis, snowboards and accessories. MEC had formerly focused on \\"self- propelled outdoor wilderness activites\\" and these new product lines made it a competitor in the urban sports retail market under CEO Labistour. MEC had positioned itself as a competitor to the Forzani Group and Walmart Canada, and this attracted complaints from retailers like Sporting Life, whose co-founder David Russell noted that as a co-op, MEC had considerable tax advantages. In 2017, it was reported that 36% of the products sold by the MEC were its own brand. The organization had 22 retail stores and 2,450 employees. Kelowna, Laval, South Edmonton and North York had brand-new MEC stores and the store in London, Ontario had been relocated. The North York store was the third store in the Greater Toronto Area, while Kelowna was the first store added in the Okanagan. In 2016 the fiscal year was changed from end-December to end- February. The co-op planned to open a new store in Kitchener, and relocate the stores in Edmonton and Quebec City in the spring of 2017. Planning was also underway for a relocated Toronto store for the fall of 2018, a new Calgary South store in the fall of 2018, relocation of the Vancouver store and the opening of a new store in west Calgary for the fall of 2019. On August 10, 2017, it was reported by the Corporate Registrar of BC that as of August 2, 1314625 Ontario Limited had been listed as an extraprovincial company having business as a foreign entity in BC. ===2020 financial difficulties and sale=== In November 2018, South African-born CEO David Labistour announced his plans to leave MEC, after 11 years as CEO. Between 2003 and 2008, he had been employed by the firm as \\"Chief Product Officer\\". Labistour grew the company's share ownership from 2.7 million members to 5.1 million members and opened 11 new retail locations. Ellen Pekeles was then chair of the Board of Directors. In May 2019 the former chief financial officer at Best Buy Canada, Philippe Arrata, was appointed as CEO of MEC. Arrata had been an MEC board member between 2015 and 2018, and was also an adjunct professor at the University of British Columbia’s Sauder School of Business. In December 2019, MEC announced a net loss of $11.5 million for the fiscal year that had ended February 24, 2019, which included restructuring charges of $8.5 million. This compared to net earnings of $11.7 million a year earlier. In May 2020 Steve Grant, a former MEC staff member and former member of the board of directors, along with other long-term members, accused the MEC board of rigging its own elections since 2012, to allow it to stack the board with its own preferred members. The board had amended its own rules to allow it to recommend candidates on the ballot that it wanted elected and exclude candidates it deemed unqualified. As of September 14, 2020, MEC owed a syndicate of lenders $74 million. It had suffered loses and laid off 900 employees, in part because of the COVID-19 pandemic. MEC expected to owe $92.4 million by the end of November. Its year-end financial statement indicates that had \\"lost $11.487 million in 2019 on sales of $462 million\\", partly due to COVID-19. At that time, the co-op had 5 million members. ====Sale of the co-op assets==== On September 14, 2020, it was announced that MEC's assets, including the majority of its retail stores, would be acquired by private equity firm Kingswood Capital Management, LP in a deal under the federal Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act. Kingswood Capital Management plans to retain at least 17 of the 22 existing stores as well as up to 75% of the staff and operate the stores as a chain, using the existing MEC name and branding. Following the completion of the sale, the co-operative itself will continue to formally exist for the time being, but its retail activities will cease. The incoming CEO Eric Claus stated that it was \\"highly unlikely\\" that members would receive their $5 shares back. Staff cuts and closures of at least five locations are planned. The fate of a proposed location in Saskatoon (already delayed to late-2021) has also been left unclear. The decision to sell its assets to Kingswood was met with objection from some co-op members. The board of directors had not consulted MEC members about the sale nor even informed them about it. The board had also not consulted members on a possible rights issue deal, to make an internal offer to refloat the co-op. A petition was started on Change.org \\"calling on the MEC Board of Directors to cancel the deal, and hold immediate open, fair and democratic board elections\\". It had had accumulated 73,600 signatures in its first four days. By September 26, 2020 the petition had exceeded 136,000 signatures. In an official announcement on September 18, 2020 Judi Richardson, Chair of the MEC Board of Directors, addressed members, writing, \\"We recognize this has been an unsettling week for members. The sale of MEC’s business, and the decision to move the business away from the co-operative model was, after all, a very difficult decision – but it was the right one. Facing a stark choice, we chose to preserve employment opportunities, a larger store presence, and a commitment to MEC’s ethos rather than fold up the MEC tent for good.\\" In explaining whey there was no communication with members on the sale she indicated that the board had prioritized \\"preserving jobs and saving MEC from bankruptcy or liquidation. In short, we prioritized MEC’s survival.\\" She indicated that in selling all the assets of the co-op \\"a member vote (or in the case of corporations, a shareholder vote) is not required.\\" MEC founding board member Sara Golling said in a September 18, 2020 interview that she felt \\"grief and betrayal\\" at the sale of the co-op's assets to a private US investment firm. She stated, \\"MEC was a co-op, and one of the co-operative principles is democratic member control. The members were never consulted about this. We were never warned just how bad conditions were for MEC. We knew it was bad but we had rather hoped [the co-op] could survive this rough patch. We weren't given any voice at all in what happened. We were totally ignored by the board when perhaps we could have helped.\\" When asked, \\"would you shop at MEC again? Golling replied, \\"At this point, I kind of doubt it. Why would I? I feel so disappointed. So betrayed.\\" On September 21, a group of shareholders announced that it had raised $50,000 through a GoFundMe campaign in order to be represented in the CCAA process by Victory Square Law Office of Vancouver, and in order \\"to hold an emergency members' meeting to replace the board of directors\\". Co- operatives and Mutuals Canada and the British Columbia Co-op Association asked government to \\"make sure legislation governing co-ops has been respected in the deal,\\" and questioned the use of the CCAA in relation to the BC Co- operative Association Act. On September 24, it was reported that Robert Wallis, the board member who chaired the special committee that sought from March 2020 a \\"strategic alternative\\" to its own management filed an affidavit in which the then-current board said that it considered \\"impractical to impossible\\" an early disclosure to shareholders of the difficulties encountered by the then-current board with their continued management of the retail business, which then included a subsidiary, 1314625 Ontario Limited. The then-current board found \\"negligible\\" the chance that shareholders might raise sufficient funds. The burn rate of the money-losing business was then approximately $1.6 million per week. The Wallis affidavit restated the losses for year 2018-2019 as $31.4 million as opposed to the $11.5 million previously published, and disclosed that $24.5 million had been lost in the 2019-2020 business year. The Wallis affidavit listed at great length the alternatives sought by the special committee, and stated that full and fair disclosure to shareholders as part of a rights issue \\"could have had a negative impact on MEC's business, including its relationships with suppliers and landlords and its search for new financing or for a buyer.\\" The conduct of the special committee was influenced by the participation of a Financial Advisor (FTI Consulting) who were retained by the Royal Bank of Canada, who were lead banker in the lenders' consortium. On September 22, the court-appointed monitor, Alvarez & Marsal Canada Inc, urged the BC Supreme Court to endorse the $110 million sale to Kingswood in a hearing that was scheduled to occur on September 28. The Globe and Mail reported that between February 23 and September 6, 2020, MEC had a net loss of $20.9 million on sales of $162.8 million. The financial advisor to the liquidation process \\"contacted 158 parties; nine of them ultimately signed a letter of intent contemplating an acquisition of most or all of the assets.\\" MEC owned outright six of 22 retail locations: North York, North Vancouver, Ottawa, Burlington, Calgary and Winnipeg, which had a collective book value of $65.9 million. The Surrey distribution centre had a book value of $24.4 million. On September 25 it was disclosed in the Save MEC Notice of Application for intervenor status that the stakeholding of the 5.7 million members amounted to $192 million, or an average of $33 per member, who represented 22% of the working-age population of Canada. On September 28, the current management responded in a court filing, which said they doubted the ability of Save MEC to address the significant \\"cash flow issues, noting that the proposed sources of potential funding don't involve concrete commitments or realistic options\\" and remarked that they feared \\"the proposed adjournment would put the deal (with Kingswood) in jeopardy.\\" On September 27, 2020 Kingswood announce that MEC's new president and chief operating officer would be Jay Taylor, the CEO of LALO Tactical, a San Diego, California based supplier of military and police gear. MEC members protested that his appointment clashes with the co-op's values. ==Store locations opened== MEC has expanded across Canada as follows: * Vancouver (1972) * Calgary (downtown) (1977) * Toronto (downtown) (1985) ; Gibson years: * Ottawa (1992) * Edmonton (downtown) (1998) ; Robinson years: * Halifax (2001) * Winnipeg (2002) * Montreal (2003) * Quebec City (2004) * North Vancouver (2004) * Victoria (2006) ; Labistour years: * Burlington (2008) * Longueuil (2009) * Barrie (2010) * London, Ontario (2011) * Langley (2013) * Kelowna (2016) * Laval (2016) * Edmonton (South Edmonton Common) (2016) * Toronto (North York) (2016) * Kitchener (2017) * Calgary (South) (2018) ; Claus years: * Saskatoon (Midtown) (proposed for late 2021) ==References== ==External links== * Category:1971 establishments in British Columbia Category:Camping equipment manufacturers Category:Clothing brands of Canada Category:Clothing retailers of Canada Category:Companies based in Vancouver Category:Consumers' co-operatives of Canada Category:Outdoor clothing brands Category:Retail companies established in 1971 Category:Sporting goods retailers of Canada ","title":"Mountain Equipment Co-op"},{"id":"1283621","text":"Bordetella () is a genus of small (0.2 – 0.7 µm), Gram-negative coccobacilli of the phylum Proteobacteria. Bordetella species, with the exception of B. petrii, are obligate aerobes, as well as highly fastidious, or difficult to culture. All species can infect humans. The first three species to be described (B. pertussis, B. parapertussis, B. bronchiseptica); are sometimes referred to as the 'classical species'. Two of these (B. bronchiseptica and B. pertussis) are also motile.Hewlett, Erik L.; Damron, F. Heath; Wong, Ting; Fernandez, Julieta; Sisti, Federico; Zacca, Federico; Gonyar, Laura A.; Hoffman, Casandra L. (2019-06-25). «Bordetella pertussis Can Be Motile and Express Flagellum-Like Structures». mBio (en inglés) 10(3): e00787-19. ISSN 2150-7511. pmid=incorrecto (ayuda). doi:10.1128/mBio.00787-19 B. pertussis and occasionally B. parapertussis cause pertussis or whooping cough in humans, and some B. parapertussis strains can colonise sheep. B. bronchiseptica rarely infects healthy humans, though disease in immunocompromised patients has been reported. B. bronchiseptica causes several diseases in other mammals, including kennel cough and atrophic rhinitis in dogs and pigs, respectively. Other members of the genus cause similar diseases in other mammals, and in birds (B. hinzii, B. avium). The genus Bordetella is named after Jules Bordet. ==Pathogenesis== The most thoroughly studied of the Bordetella species are B. bronchiseptica, B. pertussis and B. parapertussis, and the pathogenesis of respiratory disease caused by these bacteria has been reviewed. Transmission occurs by direct contact, or via respiratory aerosol droplets, or fomites. Bacteria initially adhere to ciliated epithelial cells in the nasopharynx, and this interaction with epithelial cells is mediated by a series of protein adhesins. These include filamentous haemaglutinin, pertactin, fimbriae, and pertussis toxin (though expression of pertussis toxin is unique to B. pertussis). As well as assisting in adherence to epithelial cells, some of these are also involved in attachment to immune effector cells. The initial catarrhal phase of infection produces symptoms similar to those of the common cold, and during this period, large numbers of bacteria can be recovered from the pharynx. Thereafter, the bacteria proliferate and spread further into the respiratory tract, where the secretion of toxins causes ciliostasis and facilitates the entry of bacteria to tracheal/bronchial ciliated cells. One of the first toxins to be expressed is tracheal cytotoxin, which is a disaccharide-tetrapeptide derived from peptidoglycan. Unlike most other Bordetella toxins, tracheal cytotoxin is expressed constitutively, being a normal product of the breakdown of the bacterial cell wall. Other bacteria recycle this molecule back into the cytoplasm, but in Bordetella and Neisseria gonorrhoeae, it is released into the environment. Tracheal cytotoxin itself is able to reproduce paralysis of the ciliary escalator, inhibition of DNA synthesis in epithelial cells and ultimately killing of the same. One of the most important of the regulated toxins is adenylate cyclase toxin, which aids in the evasion of innate immunity. The toxin is delivered to phagocytic immune cells upon contact. Immune cell functions are then inhibited in part by the resulting accumulation of cyclic AMP. Recently discovered activities of adenylate cyclase toxin, including transmembrane pore formation and stimulation of calcium influx, may also contribute to the intoxication of phagocytes. ==Regulation of virulence factor expression== The expression of many Bordetella adhesins and toxins is controlled by the two-component regulatory system BvgAS. Much of what is known about this regulatory system is based on work with B. bronchiseptica, but BvgAS is present in B. pertussis, B. parapertussis and B. bronchiseptica and is responsible for phase variation or phenotypic modulation. BvgS is a plasma membrane-bound sensor kinase which responds to stimulation by phosphorylating a cytoplasmic helix-turn-helix- containing protein, BvgA. When phosphorylated, BvgA has increased affinity for specific binding sites in Bvg-activated promoter sequences and is able to promote transcription in in vitro assays. Most of the toxins and adhesins under BvgAS control are expressed under Bvg+ conditions (high BvgA-Pi concentration). But there are also genes expressed solely in the Bvg− state, most notably the flagellin gene flaA. The regulation of Bvg repressed genes is mediated by the product of a 624-bp open reading frame downstream of bvgA, the so-called Bvg-activated repressor protein, BvgR. BvgR binds to a consensus sequence present within the coding sequences of at least some Bvg-repressed genes. Binding of this protein to the consensus sequence represents gene expression by reducing transcription. It is not known what the physiological signals for BvgS are, but in vitro BvgAS can be inactivated by millimolar concentrations of magnesium sulfate or nicotinic acid, or by reduction of the incubation temperature to ≤ 26 °C. The identification of a specific point mutation in the BvgS gene which locks B. bronchiseptica in an intermediate Bvg phase revealed a class of BvgAS-regulated genes that are exclusively transcribed under intermediate concentrations of BvgA-Pi. This intermediate (Bvgi) phenotype can be reproduced in wild-type B. bronchiseptica by growth of the bacteria in a medium containing intermediate concentrations of the BvgAS modulator, nicotinic acid. In these conditions, some, but not all of the virulence factors associated with the Bvg+ phase are expressed, suggesting this two-component regulatory system can give rise to a continuum of phenotypic states in response to the environment. ==References== Category:Burkholderiales Category:Whooping cough Category:Bacteria genera ","title":"Bordetella"},{"id":"1283629","text":"Image of Sanswire One, the very first model of a Stratellite as conceived by Sanswire Networks. Model dismantled after exhibitions. Stratellite is a brand name trademark of Sanswire for a future emissions-free, high-altitude stratospheric airship that provides a stationary communications platform for various types of wireless signals usually carried by communications towers or satellites. The Stratellite is a concept that has undergone several years of research and development, and is not yet commercially available; Sanswire, with its partner TAO Technologies, anticipates its current testing sequence to include the launch of a Stratellite into the stratosphere. ==Details== High- altitude airships, like the Stratellite, would hover lower than an orbiting satellite, but far above the jet stream and most weather, in the stratosphere approximately 13 mi (20 km) above the Earth. A single unit could then send broadband, mobile phone and digital television and radio signals to a large area. The unmanned Stratellite would be powered by solar cells and propelled by electric motors. So far, this technology remains unproven, and is very far from commercialization. A working proto-type that can perform all these functions doesn't exist. Lag times would be reduced by a factor of nearly 2000 compared to geosynchronous satellites, and 15 for low orbiting satellites but with a smaller coverage area. When compared to terrestrial communications towers, Stratellite coverage would be larger, with lag times being more a function of internal communications equipment rather than distance. Estimated broadband coverage of 300,000 mi2 (480,000 km2), roughly the size of Texas or France, is planned. Wireless signals could be transmitted to and from a 200 mi (320 km) diameter, but terrain features and man-made structures could partially or locally interfere with the signal. Since the Stratellite is designed for regular returns to the surface for maintenance, some overlap and redundancy would be required to maintain continuous service. Sanswire Networks initially plans to deploy this technology over major metropolitan areas. Proponents claim a high-altitude communications platform, like the Stratellite, could make terrestrial broadcast towers obsolete, reducing the cost and time required for hardware updates. An update made to a single unit would effectively cascade to an entire grid of virtual broadcast towers. It will be possible to bring broadband service to a wide area currently without terrestrial towers quickly and with relative ease. ==Company details== According to corporate press releases, the Stratellite and related assets were shipped to TAO Technologies in Stuttgart, Germany for further evaluation and design revision. Sanswire then formed a new German corporation known as Sanswire-TAO GmbH. Sanswire is not the first company to propose such a craft. Similar proposals have been made by Advanced Technologies Group (ATG) in Bedford, England, SkyLINK, Inc, in England, and SkyTower Inc., a subsidiary of AeroVironment Inc. in Monrovia, California, in the United States. Prior to September 25, 2008, Sanswire was previously known as GlobeTel Communications Corp.Press Release on Bloomberg for GlobeTel Communications Corp. changing name to Sanswire On October 17, 2012, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida granted the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's motions for over US$3 million Remedies, and granted Motions For Disgorgement, Civil Penalties and Officer-And-Director Bars Against Timothy Huff, Lawrence Lynch, Joseph J. Monterosso, Luis Vargas.SEC Litigation Release Starting in November 2007, the Securities and Exchange Commission brought civil actions against the defendants in connection with GlobeTel Communications Corp., now World Surveillance Group Inc. (GlobeTel). GlobeTel reported millions of dollars in telecommunications revenue from 2002 to 2006 that the Commission alleged was fake. Huff and former GlobeTel chief financial officer Thomas Jimenez were sentenced to prison as a result of parallel criminal prosecutions. See U.S. v. Huff, 09-cr-60295-DMM (S.D. Fla.); U.S. v. Jimenez, 08-cr-60367-DTKH (S.D. Fla.). GlobeTel and Jimenez previously consented to the entry of judgments against them in the Securities and Exchange Commission's action. The district court adopted a recommendation previously entered by a magistrate judge and ordered the following remedies: Former GlobeTel Communications (GlobeTel) chief executive officer Timothy Huff to pay a $1.21 million penalty and $1.5 million in disgorgement plus prejudgment interest. Judge Joan A. Lenard calculated Huff's penalty by imposing a third-tier penalty for each of Huff's 10 most-serious false disclosures. She also ordered him to disgorge the full $1.5 million that he received when he exercised stock options in the midst of the fraud. Former GlobeTel chief financial officer Lawrence Lynch to pay a $780,000 civil penalty. Former GlobeTel former executive Joseph J. Monterosso to pay a $300,000 penalty and $675,000 in disgorgement plus prejudgment interest (joint-and-severable with Luis Vargas) and Monterosso barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for 10 years.

Ownership of the worldwide chain of stores is split between three companies: Metro AG in Europe, SHV Holdings in Latin America, and CP ALL in Asia. SHV opened the first Makro in Amsterdam in 1968. In the following years more stores opened in the Netherlands and several other European countries and, in 1971, South Africa.Makro South Africa History Retrieved 9 October 2013. In the 1970s and 1980s Makro extended its business to the Americas and Asia. Makro had also expanded to the United States in the mid-1980s. In 1989, Kmart bought the US locations, and converted most of them to Pace Warehouse in 1990. The Asian stores were also eventually sold out to various firms with the latest ones sold to CP ALL of Thailand. In 1998, owner SHV Holdings sold the Makro stores in Europe to Metro AG. Makro stores are not open to the general public (except in Belgium, Brazil, Cambodia, Myanmar and Thailand. Non-members not eligible for discounts), but only to businesses which have to be registered members in order to gain entry to the store. == Ownership == SHV originated in 1896 from a merger between a number of large coal mining companies, some of which had been active since the 18th century. In 1968, the first Makro store opened in Amsterdam. In April 1971 the first Makro in the UK opened in Eccles, Manchester. In 1971, the first Makro store outside Europe opened in South Africa (the South African stores were subsequently in 1990 exchanged for a shareholding in Massmart and in 2004 SHV sold its Massmart shares). In 1988, the first Makro store in Asia opened in Thailand. In 1998, all European Makro stores were acquired by Metro AG, the German retail and wholesale giant. In 2010, Makro Cash & Carry Indonesia was sold to Lotte Mart and rebranded as Lotte Mart Wholesale. In 2012, Metro sold the Makro UK business to Booker Group; and Makro-Habib in Pakistan became Metro-Habib. In 2013, SHV sold Siam Makro Pcl. (Thailand) to CP ALL, a subsidiary of CP Group. In 2014, Metro sold the Makro Greek business to Sklavenitis. == Store locations == European stores can be found in the Netherlands, Belgium, Poland, the Czech Republic, Greece, Portugal, Spain and the United Kingdom. Stores have spread as far as South Africa, Thailand, Cambodia, Colombia, Peru, Argentina, Venezuela (37 stores and 19 detail stores across Venezuela), Brazil (76 stores across Brazil), and Myanmar (Yangon 2020). In 2020, the Brazil stores were sold to Carrefour. Makro stores formerly existed in the United States (bought by Kmart in 1989 and converted into Pace Warehouses the following year), China, Indonesia (both bought by Lotte Mart and converted into such stores), Malaysia (bought by Tesco), Morocco, the Philippines (bought by SM Prime Holdings and converted into SM Hypermarket (14 Makro branches) or SaveMore Market (1 Makro branch)), Pakistan (Makro-Habib), South Korea, and in Taiwan. ===Venezuela=== Makro Venezuela operates 37 Warehouse club stores across the country, 01 distribution center and also have a subsidiary named Mikro in retail format with 19 stores. Makro Venezuela is owned by the SHV Holdings. ===Netherlands=== Makro Netherlands operates 17 stores across the Netherlands, with seven of the stores also containing a fuel station. Makro Netherlands is owned by the Metro Group. ===Thailand=== Siam Makro Public Company Limited was established in 1988. At the end of April 2020 there were 100 Makro stores and Makro FoodService stores in operation, serving a registered customer base of 2.6 million. Revenues for 2020 were 210 billion baht with a net profit of 6.2 billion baht. Siam Makro shares are traded on the Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET). In 2013, Siam Makro was purchased by Charoen Pokphand Group for US$6.6 billion. Siam Makro is owned by CP ALL, a subsidiary of CP Group. ===United Kingdom=== Makro UK operates 30 branches across the United Kingdom. Since 2012 Makro UK has been owned by Booker Group, and 11 of the Makro branches now operate as a combined Booker/Makro. == Product range == Makro sells food and non-food products, usually located in different sections of the store. Each store also contains a hot-food cafeteria, and a cash machine. The food section always includes a fresh fish section, a wine section, fresh meat and butchery department, and refrigerated aisles. The non-food area includes clothing, DIY, office supplies, electricals, computing, and seasonals such as garden furniture. Special offers are featured via a printed and online fortnight brochure known as Makro Mail. The stores are not open to the general public, but serve the following trades: * Newsagent's shops and convenience stores. * Restaurants, hotels and caterers. * Schools, universities, sport clubs and associations. Customers can shop at Makro with a membership card. Makro UK used to have the tag-line \\"The UK's No.1 Discounter\\". This tag-line was replaced with \\"For Professionals\\". Makro has subsequently changed this to \\"Your business partner everyday\\" [sic]. Recent changes to the Makro UK structure include the closure of three stores: Wolverhampton, Coventry and Swansea. Metro announced that the company has to be financially independent by 2011, and in 2012 Makro UK was sold to the rival wholesaler Booker Group in an agreement valued at around £140 million. ==References== Category:Wholesalers of Germany Category:Retail companies established in 1968 Category:Companies based in Düsseldorf ","title":"Makro"},{"id":"1283638","text":"Canopus , also designated α Carinae, Latinised to Alpha Carinae, is the brightest star in the southern constellation of Carina and the second- brightest star in the night sky. With a visual apparent magnitude of −0.74, it is outshone only by Sirius. Located around from the Sun, Canopus is a bright giant of spectral type A9, so it is essentially white when seen with the naked eye. It has a luminosity over 10,000 times the luminosity of the Sun, is eight times as massive, and has expanded to 71 times the Sun's radius. Its enlarged photosphere has an effective temperature of around . Canopus is undergoing core helium burning and is currently in the so-called blue loop phase of its evolution, having already passed through the red-giant branch after exhausting the hydrogen in its core. Canopus is a source of X-rays, which are likely being emitted from its corona. The prominent appearance of Canopus means it has been the subject of mythological lore among many ancient peoples. Its proper name is generally considered to originate from the mythological Canopus, who was a navigator for Menelaus, king of Sparta. The acronychal rising marked the date of the Ptolemaia festival in Egypt. In ancient India, it was named Agastya after the revered Vedic sage. For Chinese astronomers, it was known as the Old Man of the South Pole. ==Nomenclature== The name Canopus is a Latinisation of the Ancient Greek name Κάνωβος/Kanôbos, recorded in Claudius Ptolemy's Almagest (c.150 AD). Eratosthenes used the same spelling. Hipparchos wrote it as Κάνωπος. John Flamsteed wrote Canobus, as did Edmond Halley in his 1679 Catalogus Stellarum Australium. The name has two possible derivations, both listed in Richard Hinckley Allen's seminal Star Names: Their Lore and Meaning. * Argo Navis was the ship used by Jason and the Argonauts in the legend of the Trojan War. The brightest star in the constellation was given the name of a ship's pilot from another Greek legend: Canopus, pilot of Menelaus' ship on his quest to retrieve Helen of Troy after she was taken by Paris. * A ruined ancient Egyptian port named Canopus lies near the mouth of the Nile, site of the Battle of the Nile. It is speculated that its name is derived from the Egyptian Coptic Kahi Nub (\\"Golden Earth\\"), which refers to how Canopus would have appeared near the horizon in ancient Egypt, reddened by atmospheric extinction from that position. In 2016, the International Astronomical Union organized a Working Group on Star Names (WGSN) to catalog and standardize proper names for stars. The WGSN's first bulletin of July 2016 included a table of the first two batches of names approved by the WGSN, which included Canopus for this star. Canopus is now included in the IAU Catalog of Star Names. Canopus traditionally marked the rudder of the ship Argo Navis. German celestial cartographer Johann Bayer gave it—as the brightest star in the constellation—the designation of α Argus (Latinised to Alpha Argus) in 1603. In 1763, French astronomer Nicolas Louis de Lacaille divided the huge constellation into three smaller ones, and hence Canopus became α Carinae (Latinised to Alpha Carinae). It is listed in the Bright Star Catalogue as HR 2326, the Henry Draper Catalogue as HD 45348, and the Hipparcos catalogue as HIP 30438. Flamsteed did not number this southern star, but Benjamin Apthorp Gould gave it the number 7 (7 G. Carinae) in his Uranometria Argentina. An occasional name seen in English is Soheil, or the feminine Soheila; in Turkish is Süheyl, or the feminine Süheyla, from the Arabic name for several bright stars, سهيل suhayl, and Canopus was known as Suhel in medieval times. Alternative spellings include Suhail, Souhail, Suhilon, Suheyl, Sohayl, Suhayil, Shoel, Sohil, Soheil, Sahil, Suhayeel, Sohayil, Sihel, and Sihil. An alternative name was Wazn \\"weight\\" or Haḍar \\"ground\\", possibly related to its low position near the horizon. Hence comes its name in the Alphonsine Tables, Suhel ponderosus, a Latinization of Al Suhayl al Wazn. Its Greek name was revived during the Renaissance. ==Observation== The Spanish Muslim astronomer Ibn Rushd went to Marrakesh (in Morocco) to observe the star in 1153, as it was invisible in his native Córdoba, Al-Andalus. He used the different visibility in different latitudes to argue that the earth is round, following Aristotle's argument which held that such an observation was only possible if the earth was a relatively small sphere. English explorer Robert Hues brought Canopus to the attention of European observers in his 1592 work Tractatus de Globis, along with Achernar and Alpha Centauri, noting: > \\"Now, therefore, there are but three Stars of the first magnitude that I > could perceive in all those parts which are never seene here in England. The > first of these is that bright Star in the sterne of Argo which they call > Canobus. The second is in the end of Eridanus. The third is in the right > foote of the Centaure.\\"Knobel, p. 416. alt=A field of stars against the Milky Way background with the prominent stars and constellations labelled In the Southern Hemisphere, Canopus and Sirius are both visible high in the sky simultaneously, and reach a meridian just apart. Brighter than first magnitude, Canopus can be seen by naked eye in the early twilight. Mostly visible in mid to late summer in the Southern Hemisphere, Canopus culminates at midnight on December 27, and at 9 PM on February 11.Schaaf, p. 257. When seen from latitudes south of S, Canopus is a circumpolar star. Since Canopus is so far south in the sky, it never rises in mid- to far-northern latitudes; in theory the northern limit of visibility is latitude north. This is just south of Athens, Richmond, Virginia (USA), and San Francisco, and very close to Seville and Agrigento. It is almost exactly the latitude of Lick Observatory on Mt. Hamilton, California, from which it is readily visible because of the effects of elevation and atmospheric refraction, which add another degree to its apparent altitude. Under ideal conditions, it can be spotted as far north as latitude from the Pacific coast.D. Gieringer, \\"Exploring the Tropic of Canopus\\", Astronomy, December 1985, p.24. Another northernmost record of visibility came from Mount Nemrut in Turkey, latitude . It is more easily visible in places such as the Gulf Coast and Florida, and the island of Crete (Greece) where the best season for viewing it around 9 p.m. is during late January and early February. Canopus has a B–V color index of +0.15—where 0 is a blue-white—indicating it is essentially white, although it has been described as yellow-white. Canopus' spectral type has been given as F0 and the incrementally warmer A9. It is less yellow than Altair or Procyon, with indices measured as 0.22 and 0.42, respectively. Some observers may have perceived Canopus as yellow-tinged because it is low in the sky and hence subject to atmospheric effects.Schaaf, pp. 112–13. Patrick Moore said that it never appeared anything but white to him. The bolometric correction for Canopus is 0.00, indicating that the visual absolute magnitude and bolometric absolute magnitude are equal. Canopus was previously proposed to be a member of the Scorpius–Centaurus Association, however it is not located near the subgroups of that association, and has not been included as a Sco-Cen member in kinematic studies that used Hipparcos astrometric data. Canopus is not thought to be a member of any nearby young stellar groups. In 2014, astronomer Eric Mamajek reported that an extremely magnetically active M dwarf (having strong coronal X-ray emission), 1.16 degrees south of Canopus, appears to share a common proper motion with Canopus. The projected separation of the M dwarf 2MASS J06234738-5351131 (\\"Canopus B\\") is approximately 1.9 parsecs. However, despite this large separation, it is still within the estimated tidal radius (2.9 parsecs) for the massive star Canopus. No star closer than Canopus is more luminous than it, and it has been the brightest star in Earth's night sky during three epochs over the past four million years. Other stars appear brighter only during relatively temporary periods, during which they are passing the Solar System much closer than Canopus. About 90,000 years ago, Sirius moved close enough that it became brighter than Canopus, and that will remain so for another 210,000 years. But in 480,000 years, as Sirius moves further away and appears fainter, Canopus will once again be the brightest, and will remain so for a period of about 510,000 years. ===Role in navigation=== The southeastern wall of the Kaaba in Mecca is aligned with the rising point of Canopus, and is also named Janūb. The Bedouin people of the Negev and Sinai knew Canopus as Suhayl, and used it and Polaris as the two principal stars for navigation at night. Because it disappears below the horizon in those regions, it became associated with a changeable nature, as opposed to always-visible Polaris, which was circumpolar and hence 'steadfast'. The south celestial pole can be approximately located using Canopus and another bright star, Achernar, as the three make an equilateral triangle. Canopus sits on an imaginary line that extends one way to Sirius and to the south celestial pole. Canopus's brightness and location well off the ecliptic make it useful for space navigation. Many spacecraft carry a special camera known as a \\"Canopus Star Tracker\\" plus a Sun sensor for attitude determination. Mariner 4 used Canopus for second axis stabilisation (after locking on the Sun) in 1964, the first time a star had been used. ==Spectrum== Canopus was little-studied by western scientists before the 20th century. It was given a spectral class of F in 1897, an early use of this extension to Secchi class I, applied to those stars where the hydrogen lines are relatively weak and the calcium K line relatively strong. It was given as a standard star of F0 in the Henry Draper Catalogue, with the spectral type F0 described as having hydrogen lines half the strength of an A0 star and the calcium K line three times as strong as Hδ. American astronomer Jesse Greenstein was interested in stellar spectra and used the newly built Otto Struve Telescope at McDonald Observatory to analyze the star's spectrum in detail. In a 1942 paper, he reported that the spectrum is dominated by strong broad hydrogen lines. There are also absorption lines of carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, sulphur, iron, and many ionised metals. It was studied in the ultraviolet by an early astronomical satellite, Gemini XI in 1966. The UV spectra were considered to be consistent with an F0 supergiant having a temperature of , the accepted parameters for Canopus at the time. New Zealand-based astronomers John Hearnshaw and Krishna Desikachary examined the spectrum in greater detail, publishing their results in 1982. When luminosity classes were added to the MK spectral classification scheme, Canopus was assigned class Iab indicating an intermediate luminosity supergiant. This was based on the relative strengths of certain spectral lines understood to be sensitive to the luminosity of a star. In the Bright Star Catalogue 5th edition it is given the spectral class F0II, the luminosity class indicating a bright giant. Balmer line profiles and oxygen line strengths indicate the size and luminosity of Canopus. When the effects of stellar rotation speed on spectral lines are accounted for, the MK spectral class of Canopus is adjusted to A9II. Its spectrum consists mostly of absorption lines on a visible continuum, but some emission has been detected. For example, the calcium K line have weak emission wings on each side of the strong central absorption line, first observed in 1966. The emission line profiles are usually correlated with the luminosity of the star as described by the Wilson-Bappu effect, but in the case of Canopus they indicate a luminosity much lower than that calculated by other methods. More detailed observations have shown that the emission line profiles are variable and may be due to plage areas on the surface of the star. Emission can also be found in other lines such as the h and k lines of ionised magnesium. ==Distance== Before the launch of the Hipparcos satellite telescope, distance estimates for Canopus varied widely, from 96 light-years to 1200 light-years. The closer distance was derived from parallax measurements of around . The larger distance derives from the assumption of a very bright absolute magnitude for Canopus. Hipparcos established Canopus as being () from the Solar System; this is based on its 2007 parallax measurement of . At 96 parsecs, the interstellar extinction for Canopus is very low at 0.08 magnitudes. Canopus is too bright to be included in the normal observation runs of the Gaia satellite and there is no published Gaia parallax for it. At present the star is drifting further away from the Sun with a radial velocity of 20 km/s. Some 3.1 million years ago it made the closest approach to the Sun at a distance of about . Canopus is orbiting the Milky Way with a heliocentric velocity of 24.5 km/s and a low eccentricity of 0.065. ==Physical characteristics== Canopus is the brightest star in the constellation of Carina (top). The absorption lines in the spectrum of Canopus shift slightly with a period of . This was first detected in 1906 and the Doppler variations were interpreted as orbital motion. An orbit was even calculated, but no such companion exists and the small radial velocity changes are due to movements in the atmosphere of the star. The maximum observed radial velocities are only 0.7 to . Canopus also has a magnetic field that varies with the same period, detected by the Zeeman splitting of its spectral lines. Canopus is bright at microwave wavelengths, one of the few F-class stars to be detected by radio. The rotation period of the star is not accurately known, but may be over three hundred days. The projected rotational velocity has been measured at 9 km/s. An early interferometric measurement of its angular diameter in 1968 gave a limb-darkened value of , close to the accepted modern value. Very-long-baseline interferometry has been used to calculate Canopus' angular diameter at . Combined with distance calculated from its Hipparcos parallax, this gives it a radius of 71 times that of the Sun. If it were at the centre of the Solar System, it would extend 90% of the way to the orbit of Mercury. The radius and temperature relative to the Sun means that it is 10,700 times more luminous than the Sun, and its position in the H-R diagram relative to theoretical evolutionary tracks means that it is times as massive as the Sun. Measurements of its shape find a 1.1° departure from spherical symmetry. Canopus is a source of X-rays, which are probably produced by its corona, magnetically heated to several million Kelvin. The temperature has likely been stimulated by fast rotation combined with strong convection percolating through the star's outer layers. The soft X-ray sub- coronal X-ray emission is much weaker than the hard X-ray coronal emission. The same behaviour has been measured in other F-class supergiants such as α Persei and is now believed to be a normal property of such stars. == Evolution == The spectrum of Canopus indicates that it has exhausted its core hydrogen and evolved away from the main sequence, where it spent some 30 million years of its existence as a blue-white star of around 10 solar masses. The position of Canopus in the H–R diagram indicates that it is currently in the core- helium burning phase. It is an intermediate mass star that has left the red- giant branch before its core became degenerate and is now in a blue loop. Models of stellar evolution in the blue loop phase show that the length of the blue loop is strongly affected by rotation and mixing effects inside the star. It is difficult to determine whether a star is currently evolving towards hotter temperature or returning to cooler temperatures, since the evolutionary tracks for stars with different masses overlap during the blue loops. Canopus lies on the warm side of the instability strip and does not pulsate like Cepheid variables of a similar luminosity. However its atmosphere does appear to be unstable, showing strong signs of convection. Canopus may not be massive enough for its fusion chain to reach iron and trigger a core collapse and subsequent supernova, instead eventually becoming a neon-oxygen white dwarf. ==Cultural significance== Canopus was known to the ancient Mesopotamians and given the name NUN-ki and represented the city of Eridu in the Three Stars Each Babylonian star catalogues and later MUL.APIN around 1100 BC. Today, the star Sigma Sagittarii is known by the common name Nunki. Canopus was not visible to the mainland ancient Greeks and Romans; it was, however, visible to the ancient Egyptians.Schaaf, p. 107. Hence Aratus did not write of the star as it remained below the horizon, while Eratosthenes and Ptolemy—observing from Alexandria—did, calling it Kanōbos. An Egyptian priestly poet in the time of Thutmose III mentions the star as Karbana, \\"the star which pours his light in a glance of fire, when he disperses the morning dew.\\" Under the Ptolemies, the star was known as Ptolemaion (Greek: Πτολεμαῖον) and its acronychal rising marked the date of the Ptolemaia festival, which was held every four years, from 262 to 145 BC.Martianus Capella 7.838, ; Hazzard. 2000. Imagination of a Monarchy: Studies in Ptolemaic Propaganda, 34–36. Averroes, who used his 1153 observation of Canopus in Marrakesh while the star was invisible in his native Spain as an argument that the earth is round. ===India=== In Indian Vedic literature, Canopus is associated with the sage Agastya, one of the ancient siddhars and rishis (the others are associated with the stars of the Big Dipper). To Agastya, the star is said to be the 'cleanser of waters', and its rising coincides with the calming of the waters of the Indian Ocean. It is thus considered the son of Pulastya, son of Brahma. Canopus is described by Pliny the Elder and Gaius Julius Solinus as the largest, brightest and only source of starlight for navigators near Tamraparni island (ancient Sri Lanka) during many nights. ===China=== Canopus was described as Shou Xing, the Star of Longevity, in the Shiji (Records of the Grand Historian) completed in 94 BC by Chinese historian Sima Qian. Drawing on sources from the Warring States period, he noted it to be the southern counterpart of Sirius, and wrote of a sanctuary dedicated to it established by Emperor Qin Shi Huang between 221 and 210 BC. During the Han dynasty, the star was auspicious, its appearance in the southern sky heralding peace and absence war. From the imperial capital Chang'an, the star made a low transit across the southern sky, indicating true south to observers, and was often obscured by clouds. During this time it was also equated with Old Man of the South Pole (in ) Under this name, Canopus appears (albeit misplaced northwards) on the medieval Chinese manuscript the Dunhuang Star Chart, although it cannot be seen from the Chinese capital of Chang'an. The Chinese astronomer Yi Xing had journeyed south to chart Canopus and other far southern stars in 724 AD. Its personification as the Old Man Star was popularised in the Tang Dynasty, where it appeared often in poetry and memorials. Later still, during the Ming Dynasty, the star was established as one of the Three Stars (Fu Lo Shou), appearing frequently in art and literature of the time. This symbolism spread into neighbouring cultures in Asia. In Japan, Canopus is known as Mera-boshi and Roujin-sei (the old man star), and in Mongolia, it was personified as the White Old Man. Although the link was known in Tibet, with names such as Genpo karpo (Rgan po dkar po) or Genkar (Rgan dkar) \\"White Old Man\\", the symbolism was not popular. Instead, Canopus was more commonly named Karma Rishi སྐར་མ་རི་ཥི།, derived from Indian mythology. Tibetans celebrated the star's heliacal rising with ritual bathing and associated it with morning dew. ===Polynesia=== Bright stars were important to the ancient Polynesians for navigation between the many islands and atolls of the Pacific Ocean. Low on the horizon, they acted as stellar compasses to assist mariners in charting courses to particular destinations. Canopus served as the southern wingtip of a \\"Great Bird\\" constellation called Manu, with Sirius as the body and Procyon the northern wingtip, which divided the Polynesian night sky into two hemispheres. The Hawaiian people called Canopus Ke Alii-o-kona-i-ka-lewa, \\"The chief of the southern expanse\\"; it was one of the stars used by Hawaiʻiloa and Ki when they traveled to the Southern Ocean. The Māori people of New Zealand/Aotearoa had several names for Canopus. Ariki (\\"High-born\\"), was known as a solitary star that appeared in the east, prompting people to weep and chant. They also named it Atutahi, Aotahi or Atuatahi, \\"Stand Alone\\".p. 419, Mythology: Myths, Legends and Fantasies, Janet Parker, Alice Mills, Julie Stanton, Durban, Struik Publishers, 2007. Its solitary nature indicates it is a tapu star, as tapu people are often solitary. Its appearance at the beginning of the Maruaroa season foretells the coming winter; light rays to the south indicate a cold wet winter, and to the north foretell a mild winter. Food was offered to the star on its appearance. This name has several mythologies attached to it. One story tells of how Atutahi was left outside the basket representing the Milky Way when Tāne wove it. Another related myth about the star says that Atutahi was the first-born child of Rangi, who refused to enter the Milky Way and so turned it sideways and rose before it. The same name is used for other stars and constellations throughout Polynesia. Kapae-poto, \\"Short horizon\\", referred to it rarely setting as seen in New Zealand; Kauanga (\\"Solitary\\") was the name for Canopus only when it was the last star visible before sunrise. The people of the Society Islands had two names for Canopus, as did the Tuamotu people. The Society Islanders called Canopus Taurua-e-tupu-tai-nanu, \\"Festivity-whence- comes-the-flux-of-the-sea\\", and Taurua-nui-o-te-hiti-apatoa \\"Great-festivity- of-the-border-of-the-south\\", and the Tuamotu people called the star Te Tau- rari and Marere-te-tavahi, the latter said to be the true name for the former, \\"He-who-stands-alone\\". ===Africa=== In the Guanche mythology of the island of Tenerife (Spain), the star Canopus was linked with the goddess Chaxiraxi. The Tswana people of Botswana knew Canopus as Naka. Appearing late in winter skies, it heralded increasing winds and a time when trees lose their leaves. Stock owners knew it was time to put their sheep with rams. In southern Africa, the Sotho, Tswana and Venda people called Canopus Naka or Nanga, “the Horn Star”, while the Zulu and Swazi called it inKhwenkwezi \\"Brilliant star\\". It appears in the predawn sky in the third week of May. According to the Venda, the first person to see Canopus would blow a phalaphala horn from the top of a hill, getting a cow for a reward. The Sotho chiefs also awarded a cow, and ordered their medicine men to roll bone dice and read the fortune for the coming year. To the ǀXam-speaking Bushmen of South Africa, Canopus and Sirius signalled the appearance of termites and flying ants. They also believed that stars had the power to cause death and misfortune, and they would pray to Sirius and Canopus in particular to impart good fortune or skill. The ǃKung people people of the Kalahari Desert in Botswana held Canopus and Capella to be the horns of tshxum (the Pleiades), the appearance of all three marking the end of the dry season and start of the rainy season. The Kalapalo people of Mato Grosso state in Brazil saw Canopus and Procyon as Kofongo \\"Duck\\", with Castor and Pollux representing his hands. The asterism's appearance signified the coming of the rainy season and increase in manioc, a food staple fed to guests at feasts. ===Americas=== The Navajo observed the star and named it Maʼii Bizòʼ, the “Coyote Star”. According to legend, Maʼii (Coyote) took part in the naming and placing of the star constellations during the creation of the universe. He placed Canopus directly south, naming it after himself.Maryboy, Nancy D. (2004). A Guide to Navajo Astronomy. Indigenous Education Institute : Bluff, Utah. ===Australia=== Canopus was identified as the moiety ancestor Waa \\"Crow\\" to some Koori people in southeastern Australia. The Boorong people of northwestern Victoria recalled that War (Canopus) was the brother of Warepil (Sirius), and that he brought fire from the heavens and introduced it to mankind. His wife was Collowgullouric War (Eta Carinae). The Pirt-Kopan-noot people of western Victoria told of Waa \\"Crow\\" falling in love with a queen, Gneeanggar \\"Wedge- tailed Eagle\\" (Sirius) and her six attendants (the Pleiades). His advances spurned, he hears that the women are foraging for grubs and so transforms himself into a grub. When the women dig him out, he changes into a giant and carries her off.Mudroodoo, p. 55. The Kulin people knew Canopus as Lo-an-tuka. Objects in the sky were also associated with states of being for some tribes; the Wailwun of northern New South Wales knew Canopus as Wumba \\"deaf\\", alongside Mars as Gumba \\"fat\\" and Venus as Ngindigindoer \\"you are laughing\\". Tasmanian aboriginal lore held that Canopus was Dromerdene, the brother of Moinee; the two fought and fell out of the sky, with Dromerdene falling into Louisa Bay in southwest Tasmania. ===Legacy=== Canopus-class battleship HMS Glory Canopus appears on the flag of Brazil, symbolising the state of Goiás. Two U.S. Navy submarine tenders have been named after Canopus, the first serving from 1922 to 1942 and the second serving from 1965 to 1994. The Royal Navy built six s which entered services between 1899 and 1902, and nine Canopus-class ships of the line in the early 19th century. There are at least two mountains named after the star: Mount Canopus in Antarctica; and Mount Canopus or Canopus Hill in Tasmania, the location of the Canopus Hill astronomical observatory. ==See also== * Canopus in fiction ==References== ===Bibliography=== * * == External links == Carinae, Alpha Category:Carina (constellation) Category:A-type bright giants 045348 030438 2326 Category:Stars with proper names Category:Durchmusterung objects ","title":"Canopus"},{"id":"1283639","text":"Shepherds' Crusade may refer to: *Shepherds' Crusade (1251) *Crusade of the Poor (1309), also called the Shepherds' Crusade *Shepherds' Crusade (1320) ","title":"Shepherds' Crusade"},{"id":"1283641","text":"Young Adelaide Voices is a large children's choir in Adelaide, South Australia, run by Christie Anderson.

His mature views were developed within the Kyoto School of philosophy. According to Christopher Ives: \\"Since the death of D. T. Suzuki in 1966, Masao Abe has served as the main representative of Zen Buddhism in Europe and North America.\\"Christopher Ives, \\"Introduction\\" at xiii-xix, xiii, in The Emptying God. A Buddhist-Jewish-Christian Conversation (Maryknoll, New York: Orbis Books 1990), edited by John B. Cobb, Jr. and Christopher Ives.\\"Masao Abe has been the leading philosophical exponent of Zen to the West since the death of D. T. Suzuki.\\" John Hick, in his \\"Foreword\\" at ix, to Masao Abe, Zen and Western Thought (Univ.of Hawaii 1975), edited by William R. LaFleur. ==Life and career== ===Training=== Abe's father was a medical doctor, his mother a practitioner of Pure Land Jōdo Shinshū Buddhism, from whom his early faith in Amida Buddha.Amitābha (Skt), Amida (Jpn), means boundless light. \\"One of the most important and popular buddhas of the Mahayana [school], unknown in early Buddhism.\\" \\"Amitābha is at the center of worship\\" in Pure Land Buddhism. Access to liberation becomes possible by such worship (or even by Nembutsu (Jpn), calling out the name). \\"The veneration of Amitābha represents... a new path to salvation... owing to help from outside through the liberating will of... Amitābha.\\" Ingrid Fischer-Schreiber, Franz- Karl Ehrhard, Michael S. Diener, Lexikon der őstlichen Weisheitslehren (1986), translated as Shambala Dictionary of Buddhism and Zen (1991), Amitābha entry, at 5-6. Such help from another or Tariki (Jpn) is often contrasted with Jiriki (Jpn), one's own power (as generally in Zen). Yet this distinction may be seen as artificial, due to each one being endowed with Buddha-nature. Cf., Jiriki entry, at 104. Abe, however, experienced this distinction as a source of personal turbulence; this spiritual crisis eventually led him to his own buddha-nature, under the guidance of his teacher Hisamatsu. See text here below. Born in Osaka, Abe was the third of six children. His higher education began at Osaka Municipal University, where he studied Economics and Law. For four years during the late 1930s he worked in a business office at a private trading company in neighboring Kobe. Yet Abe was seriously troubled by an ongoing personal crisis, which stemmed from the perceived conflict: rationality versus faith in the Amida of Pure Land Buddhism. This conflict he thought he could conclusively resolve in favor of faith through the study of philosophy, by which he could overcome objections posed by reason.Christopher Ives, \\"Introduction\\" at xiii-xiv, in The Emptying God (Maryknoll: Orbis 1990).Jeff M. Shore, \\"The True Buddha is Formless: Masao Abe's Religious Quest\\" at 3-9, 3-4, in Masao Abe. A Life of Dialogue (Rutland VT: Charles E. Tuttle 1998), edited by Donald W. Mitchell. Abe entered Kyoto University in April 1942.In 1949 at Kyoto University, Abe would complete the graduate course (under the old Japanese system) in Buddhism and comparative religion. Donald W. Mitchell, \\"Preface\\" at xi-xxiv, xii, in Masao Abe. A Zen Life of Dialogue (1998). It was a courageous step, as he changed career direction in mid- stream, exceptional in Japanese life, yet even more so considering the current political situation. He studied Western philosophy under Hajime Tanabe. Also, Abe studied Zen under the direction of Shin'ichi Hisamatsu, a philosophy professor at Kyoto University and a lay practitioner of the Rinzai school. Guided by Hisamatsu,Prof. Hisamatsu became known and admired in the West. In 1958 he visited Carl Jung, their conversation being transcribed. Young- Eisendrath and Muramoto (eds.), Awkening and Insight: Zen Buddhism and Psychotherapy (London: Routledge 2002), pp. 111, 116. Abe worked with others to revitalize Buddhist youth organization at Kyoto University throughout the 1940s.Specifically, Gakudo-Dojo [Place for study of the Way], which was followed during the war by the formation of the F.A.S. Society [Formless self, All humankind, Supra-historical].Cf., Felix E. Prieto, \\"The F.A.S. Acronym in Masao Abe's Life Trajectory\\" at 35-40, in Masao Abe. A Zen Life of Dialogue (1998).The wartime government in Japan generally favored an ultra-nationalist version of Shinto, although all religious groups were compelled to support the war. William K. Bunce, Religions in Japan (C I & E 1948; reprinted 1954 by Charles E. Tuttle, Rutland VT) at 37-42. Professor Hisamatsu challenged Abe's quasi-theistic faith in Amida Buddha; instead Hisamatsu became for Abe a vital religious model, of a rigorous adherent of Sunyata (which may be called emptiness) as an ultimate reality. In consequence, Abe came to understand Amida Buddha as a sacred fiction.Christopher Ives, \\"Introduction\\" at xiv-xv, in The Emptying God (Maryknoll: Orbis 1990).\\"Part of the strength of Abe's approach to Christianity is his uncompromising rejection of theism. ... Abe himself grew up in a quasi-theistic form of Buddhism and was converted away from that to what he is convinced is the true and pure form. Hence he understands theism from within and hopes to liberate from it those who are still attached to it. The contrast to the biblical faiths thus becomes stark.\\" John B. Cobb, Jr., \\"Preface\\" at ix-xi, xi, to The Emptying God (1990) Abe's spiritual progression under Hisamatsu was complex and dialectical. Hisamatsu taught that the revered image of Amida Buddha was but a stage on the way to realizing a \\"formless\\" Buddha, whereby one could awaken to one's True Self.\\"Abe was shocked to hear [Hisamatsu] use the same basic Buddhist terminology that Abe was used to, but with what seemed to be a completely opposite interpretation!\\" Jeff M. Shore, \\"The True Buddha is Formless: Masao Abe's Religious Quest\\" at 3-9, 5, in Mitchell (ed.), Masao Abe. A Life of Dialogue (1998). Nonetheless Abe first reacted to Hisamatsu by coming to discover and experience an infinite grace from the Amida Buddha. Abe's profound quest continued. In December 1951, during a group Zen sitting at the Reiun Temple of the Myōshin-ji in Kyoto, Abe personally challenged Hisamatsu, screaming to him, \\"Is that the True Self?\\" Hisamatsu replied, \\"That's the True Self.\\" Thereafter Abe entered an intense phase and struggled with the view that \\"It's all a lie!\\" (which he cried out while dousing himself with a bucket of ice water at a subsequent group sitting). He agonized over the seeming proximity of the Deity and the devil, and with his own complicity. Finally, Abe told Hisamatsu, \\"I just cannot find any place where I can stand.\\" Hisamatsu told him, \\"Stand right at that place where there is nowhere to stand.\\"Jeff M. Shore, \\"The True Buddha is Formless: Masao Abe's Religious Quest\\" at 5-7, in Masao Abe. A Life of Dialogue (1998). Along this way Abe confronted, and managed to distinguish and overcome, a \\"positive nihilism\\" associated with the secular, irreligious philosopher Frederich Nietzsche.Later, Abe would write of an alliance of \\"authentic religiosity\\" in order to counter various \\"anti-religious ideologies\\" in our societies. Abe, \\"Author's Introduction\\" at xxii, to his Zen and Western Thought (Univ.of Hawaii 1985). Reflecting on his life development, Abe acknowledged the crucial role of Shin'ichi Hisamatsu in his spiritual formation. \\"Without him I am not what I am.\\" ===Academia=== Among Abe's chief academic influences would be the aforementioned Shin'ichi Hisamatsu (1889–1980) and also Keiji Nishitani (1900–1990), as well as Hajime Tanabe (1885–1962), key professors for Abe at Kyoto University, and Kitaro Nishida (1870–1945), teacher of Hisamatsu and Nishitani, and teacher of his own successor Tanabe. Abe follows Nishida's Kyoto school of philosophy. During the 1950s and early 1960s Abe was in communication with the well-known Buddhist scholar Daisetz Teitaro Suzuki (1870–1966), e.g., at Columbia University in New York City; Abe is said to have later assumed Suzuki's rôle as academic transmitter of Buddhism. Also in New York City, at the Union Theological Seminary, Abe encountered the Christian professors and teachers Paul Tillich (1886–1965) and Reinhold Niebuhr (1892–1971).Christopher Ives, \\"Introduction\\" at xvi, in The Emptying God (Maryknoll: Orbis 1990).Abe received a Rockefeller grant in 1955 which he used to study in New York. Donald W. Mitchell, \\"Preface\\" at xi-xxiv, xiii, in Masao Abe. A Zen Life of Dialogue (1998). From 1952 to 1980, Abe served as professor of philosophy at Nara University. Before he had been professor at Kyoto Women's College (1946–1948) and Otani University (1948–1950). Thereafter, while at Nara, Abe was concurrently professor at Kyoto University from 1955 to 1958, and from 1964-1980 professor at Hana Zono University. Also in the mid-1950s he studied Christian theology in New York City at the Union Theological Seminary and at Columbia University. Then in 1980 he left Nara University and moved to California, to the Department of Religion at the Claremont Graduate School, and later in 1983 to the University of Hawaii where he served as Professor of Japanese Philosophy. From 1965 Abe participated and made presentations at many universities and colleges throughout the U.S.A. while serving as a visiting professor in residence (with his wife Ikuko).Masao Abe, Zen and Western Thought (Univ.of Hawaii 1985), edited by Wm. R. LaFleur, at ii.Abe has served at: Haverford College, Graduate Theological Union, Columbia University, University of Chicago, Princeton University, Claremont Graduate School, Purdue University, University of Hawaii, Carleton College, and Gustavus Adolphus College (2000-2001). During these years Abe shared in the Buddhist-Christian dialogue while at universities in Europe.Donald W. Mitchell, \\"Preface\\" at xv, to Masao Abe. A Zen Life of Dialogue (1998). Abe's venues included the University of Oslo, the University of Bonn, the University of Tübingen, the University of Heidelberg, and the University of Munich. Abe contributed to and led many conferences on comparative religion, Buddhism, and related subjects. He was perennially involved with: the East-West Philosophers' Conference at the University of Hawaii; and the International Buddhist-Christian Theological Encounter (the \\"Abe-Cobb group\\") which, along with Professor John B. Cobb, Jr., Abe directed.Christopher Ives, \\"Introduction\\" at xvii, in The Emptying God (Maryknoll: Orbis 1990).Donald W. Mitchell, \\"Preface\\" at xi-xxiv, xv, in Masao Abe. A Zen Life of Dialogue (1998). In addition to his contributions of creative insight and scholarship, Masao Abe also brought to interfaith meetings a serenity and a quiet charm. Here, for example, his fellow academic Arvind Sharma recalls a moment with Abe at a conference in 1986: > Abe broke into a smile. I still remember it vividly because it had a > compelling ineffable quality about it. It was so totally unencumbered. It > seemed curiously and totally detached from the environment, a happening > complete in itself, with a childlike simplicity beguiling in its > guilelessness. When his face assumed its normal expression, one was left > with the feeling of something very precious—found fleetingly and then lost > irretrievably—until he smiled again.Arvind Sharma, \\"A Chrysanthemum with a > Lotus Stalk: Reminiscences from a Hindu Perspective\\" at 326-334, 328, in > Masao Abe. A Zen Life of Dialogue (Boston: Tuttle 1998). Apparently, the source of this \\"giving gift\\" had passed through spiritual trials. Abe earlier was required to walk down a path of terrifying dread, and to make a leap into the abyss, in order to find \\"that place where there is nowhere to stand.\\"Cf., Steven Antinoff, \\"The Fire in the Lotus\\" at 10-21, 20, in Masao Abe. A Zen Life of Dialogue (1998). Antinoff underscores Abe's indominable nature by relating the story that Abe had \\"been barred from the monastery where he trained for accusing the roshi in a sanzen interview of acting.\\" Antinoff (1988) at 13.Jeff M. Shore, \\"The True Buddha is Formless: Masao Abe's Religious Quest\\" at 7, in Masao Abe. A Life of Dialogue (1998). ===Dialogue=== Abe sought to advance the interreligious dialogue while serving in his widespread teaching assignments; he led many seminars on Buddhism and western religions, particularly Christianity.Abe defined the unique, universal character of Christianity, Islam, and Buddhism as being based on conscious choice rather than ethnic birth as the ideal of membership. His focus was on the two religions he was most familiar with. Abe, \\"The End of World Religion\\" (The Eastern Buddhist 8/1 [c.1975]), reprinted in his Zen and Western Thought (Univ.of Hawaii 1985) at 261-275, 262-263, 265. A frequent procedure followed by the convened representatives of different religions was: first to attempt to understand the other's faith perspective from the inside (without compromising each one's own faith), to the extent of being able to \\"see\\" how things may look from the other's point of view; second, there would follow a period during which each would \\"return\\" to their own faith; thereafter, a more fruitful discussion might commence. Abe further sought to encourage dialogue through his various philosophical and spiritual writings.E.g., his essay \\"Kenotic God and Dynamic Sunyata\\" which appeared in The Emptying God (Maryknoll, New York: Orbis 1990) and again in Divine Emptiness and Historical Fullness (Trinity Press 1995). This essay has been published several times together with responses by Christians and Jews.Cf., Excerpt from Article by Charles B. Jones. Generally Abe has received praise for his efforts. Professor Jürgen Moltmann found that the Buddhist scholar's presentation was profound and precise concerning a central topic of Christian theology. \\"Here reciprocal understanding is not only furthered, but Christianity and Buddhism in their immiscible difference are led into a common reality. In light of this common reality, perhaps a mutual transformation does not yet begin, but certainly a reciprocal liking and opening for each other.\\"Jürgen Moltmann, \\"God is Unselfish Love\\" at 116-124, 116, in The Emptying God (Maryknoll: Orbis 1990), edited by Cobb and Ives. In 1983 Professor Abe disclosed aspects of his inner motivation. He wrote that, in addition to his abiding interest in Buddhism, he was profoundly concerned with the spiritual foundation for all of \\"humanity in a global age. To provide this foundation, a comparative and dialogical study of Buddhism and Western thought, Christianity included, is absolutely necessary.\\"Masao Abe, \\"Author's Introduction\\" to Zen and Western Thought (Univ.of Hawaii 1985) at xxiii. ==An essay with responses== * Abe's essay is entitled \\"Kenotic God and Dynamic Śūnyatā\\", which discusses emptiness in Christianity and Buddhism. Abe refers to St. Paul in his letter to the Philippians 2:5-11, especially the verses stating that \\"Christ Jesus, who, though he was in the form of God, did not count equality with God a thing to be grasped, but emptied himself, taking the form of a servant, being born in the likeness of men.\\" Abe eventually extrapolates to posit an emptying of God the Father, and hence an ontological resemblance between Christianity and the Buddhist concept of sunyata or emptiness as an ultimate reality. In the process, Abe discusses Buddhist social ethics and social responsibility. Also, he addresses the Shoah; here, he raises the difficult issue of a \\"collective karma\\" manifested in guilt felt by those far removed from the time and locale of these genocidal crimes. Abe writes for an educated multi-religious readership, with keen awareness and observation, informed to a certain extent by Process theology developed within modern Christianity, and from a perspective nurtured in the Kyoto school of Buddhist philosophy. His essay has been published as follows. ** The Emptying God: A Buddhist-Jewish-Christian Conversation (Maryknoll, NY: Orbis 1990), edited by John B. Cobb, Jr., and Christopher Ives. Professor Cobb was a leader in Process theology. Herein Abe's essay \\"Kenotic God and Dynamic Sunyata\\" appears, which is addressed by one Jewish (Eugene Borowitz) and six Christian (Thomas J. J. Altizer, John B. Cobb, Jr., Catherine Keller, Jürgen Moltmann, Schubert M. Ogden, and David Tracy) theologians. Then follows a \\"Rejoinder\\" by Abe. Several subsequent responses and replies appear in the journal Buddhist-Christian Studies (Honolulu: Univ.of Hawaii). ** Divine Emptiness and Historical Fullness. A Buddhist-Jewish-Christian Conversation with Masao Abe (Valley Forge: Trinity Press 1995), edited by Christopher Ives. Abe's essay \\"Kenotic God and Dynamic Sunyata\\" appears again (Part I) and is addressed afresh by eight new scholars. Two Jewish responses by Richard Rubenstein and Sandra B. Lubarsky are followed by four Christian, i.e., by Heinrich Ott, Marjorie Hewitt Suchocki, Hans Waldenfels, and Christopher Ives (Part II). Abe then replies (Part III). The conclusion presents the two responses of Hans Küng, and of Wolfhart Pannenberg, to each of which Abe replies (Part IV). *** Book Review by Edward L. Shirley *** Book Review by Harold Kasimow ** Previously Abe had authored a forerunner of this essay, entitled \\"Buddhism and Christianity as a Problem of Today\\". It appeared in the periodical Japanese Religions in 1963, here also followed by Western responses.Japanese Religions volume 3, issues 3-4 (1963), and following.Abe's earlier essay is mentioned both in Cobb's \\"Preface\\" at x, and in Ives's \\"Introduction\\" at xvii, in the collaborative book The Emptying God (Maryknoll NY: Orbis Press 1990). ==A Zen view of time== By realization through Zen practice of the Buddhist teaching of the impermanence of all things (Skt: anitya) (Jpn: mujō),Masao Abe, \\"Dōgen on Buddha Nature\\" at 25-68, 48-49, 55, 56-57, in his Zen and Western Thought (University of Hawaii 1985). we come to experience that we are living-dying at each and every moment. \\"If we grasp our lives not objectively from without but subjectively from within, we are not moving from life to death but are in the midst of this process of living-dying.\\"Masao Abe, \\"A Response\\" at 371-409, 376, in Masao Abe. A Zen Life of Dialogue, Mitchell, editor (Boston: Tuttle 1998). By a careful reading of Dōgen (1200–1253) and a watchful understanding of the inner sense of time, Abe learns and teaches how the objectification of time can alienate us from our own experience of its impermanence.Masao Abe, \\"Dōgen's View of Time and Space\\" at 77-105, 99, in his A Study of Dōgen. His Philosophy and Religion (Albany: SUNY 1992). Dōgen puzzled over a seeming contradiction in Buddhism. All sentient beings are originally enlightened, yet Buddhist teachings \\"arouse the longing for enlightenment\\" in those who hear it. If we do religious practice we may become enlightened due to an \\"acquired awakening\\" yet \\"original awakening\\" is ours \\"before our parents were born\\". Dōgen rejects as naturalistic fallacy a theory of \\"original awakening\\" that would equate a given human self-consciousness with genuine enlightenment. Also Dōgen rejects the idea that practice is a means to the goal of enlightenment. The epistemological process of enlightenment is undertaken by zen practice, but the process itself becomes enlightenment, i.e., the path is the way of awakening. Abe quotes Dōgen: \\"In the Buddha Dharma, practice and realization are identical. [O]ne's initial negotiating of the Way in itself is the whole of original realization. Thus, even while directed to practice, one is told not to anticipate a realization apart from practice, because practice points directly to original realization.\\"Masao Abe, \\"Dōgen on Buddha Nature\\" at 25-68, 57, in his Zen and Western Thought (University of Hawaii 1985). Instead of waiting for the time of awakening while sitting in meditation, one is \\"directly knowing temporal conditions\\" for the \\"time has already arrived\\". \\"There is no time that is not the right time.\\"Masao Abe, \\"Dōgen on Buddha Nature\\" at 35-76, 70, in his A Study of Dōgen. His Philosophy and Religion (SUNY 1992). \\"Dōgen denies continuity of time and emphasizes the independence of each point of time... .\\" Prof. Abe then quotes Dōgen to illustrate: > \\"[I]t being an established teaching of Buddhism not to speak of life > becoming death, Buddhism speaks of the unborn. It being a confirmed Buddhist > teaching that death does not become life, it speaks of non-extinction. Life > is a stage of time and death is a stage of time, like, for example, winter > and spring. We do not suppose that winter becomes spring, or say that spring > becomes summer.\\"Masao Abe, \\"Dōgen on Buddha Nature\\" at 25-68, 63, in his Zen > and Western Thought (University of Hawaii 1985). Subjectively from within, \\"the process of our living-dying [is] being without beginning and without end.\\" For Buddhists, there is no beginning of the universe (no creation), and there is no end (no last judgment). \\"We must realize the beginninglessness and endlessness of samsara, that is, the transmigration of living-dying.\\" Prof. Abe mentions several experiences: * \\"[E]ach and every moment can be a beginning and an end in itself: time begins and ends with each moment. Accordingly, time is not understood to be a unidirectional movement but is seen as a sheer series of moments that can move reciprocally. Here a sort of reversibility of time is realized.\\" * \\"[I]f we clearly realize the beginninglessness and endlessness of living-dying at this particular moment, the whole process of living-dying is concentrated within this moment. In other words, each moment embraces the whole process of beginningless and endless time within itself. Thus, one can in fact transcend time at this very moment.\\" * \\"The Buddhist view, based on full immersion in the depth of the moment, is that there is no difference between past and future. The temporal distinction belongs to the observer's perspective on the horizontal and historical plane. In the vertical or depth dimension, Buddhists insist, time is overcome.\\"Masao Abe, \\"A Response\\" at 371-409, 376, 375-376, in Masao Abe. A Zen Life of Dialogue, Mitchell, editor (Boston: Tuttle 1998). * \\"Although karma works deterministically on the horizontal dimension of time, once the vertical, or transtemporal, dimension is opened up as one awakens to the truth of no-self, that person is no longer a slave to karma but becomes its master. This means that on the basis of the realization of the true self as no-self at the bottomless depth of the vertical dimension of time, the present act can emancipate one's self from past karma and create new karma that will affect the future as, for instance, in the form of a vow.\\"Masao Abe, \\"Dōgen's View of Time and Space\\" at 77-105, 103, in his A Study of Dōgen.

It is also known as the Australian Democracy Model. The model was developed by former Governor of Victoria Richard McGarvie and originally submitted to the Republic Advisory Committee in 1993. At the Constitutional Convention of 1998, it was the second most popular model of the four voted upon. Under the McGarvie Model, a Constitutional Council would appoint and dismiss the head of state, the Governor-General. The Constitutional Council would be bound to act in accordance with the Prime Minister's advice by a convention backed by the penalty of public dismissal for breach. The three members of the Constitutional Council, who can act by majority, are determined automatically by constitutional formula, with places going first to former Governors-General (with priority to the most recently retired), and excess places going (on the same basis) in turn to former state governors, lieutenant-governors (or equivalent), judges of the High Court or judges of the Federal Court. The tenure of the head of state would be under the same arrangements as the existing practice for the current Governor-General. The head of state would also have the same range of powers as the current Governor-General, but, except for the reserve powers, they could only be exercised on the advice of the Federal Executive Council or a Minister. Otherwise there would be no codification of the constitutional conventions. The only eligibility requirement for a head of state under the McGarvie Model would be Australian citizenship because the process for selecting the head of state is designed to ensure a non-political head of state. Supporters of the model claim that, although described as \\"no-risk but uninspiring\\" and occasionally as \\"elitist\\", it has the considerable advantage of being developed by one with experience as a governor and hence a working knowledge of how the system of governorship actually functions in Australia. They claim it is straightforward, easily implemented, demonstrates twin requirements of practicality and principle, and keeps the separation of powers intact. Legal commentators have remarked that the McGarvie Model is broadly consistent with the constitution's existing arrangements under the monarchy and that it requires the least change to constitutional practice. Some republicans have been critical of the appointment process in the McGarvie model and argue that a model without any public participation in its selection mechanism would not be successful in any referendum to change the constitution. ==References== *Road to a Republic, 2004, Chapter 7 *McGarvie R, Democracy: Choosing Australia's Republic, 1999 ==External links== *The McGarvie Model Category:Republicanism in Australia ","title":"McGarvie Model"},{"id":"1283660","text":"Michael Hollett is the founder and president of North by Northeast (NXNE) music and gaming festival which happens every June in Toronto. Hollett is also founder of the new national arts magazine, NEXT, available in Toronto, Vancouver and Calgary starting December, 2020. Hollett is co-founder of Toronto's longest-running free alternative newsweekly, Now Magazine.' He was NOW editor/publisher from 1981 to 2016. == Early life == Hollett was born in Oakville, Ontario to journalist parents. While at York University, studying English, Hollett became editor of the university newspaper, Excalibur during the late 1970s, where he met his future partner, Alice Klein. They were in left-wing politics during this period and were members of the Socialist League. Hollett went on to edit small-town newspapers throughout Ontario, including the Orangeville Citizen, the Caledon Citizen and the \\"Halton Hills Herald\\", Georgetown, Ontario. == Career == In 1981, Hollett co-founded NOW with his partner Alice Klein. The paper has remained independent ever since. Although a number of alternative weekly newspapers had been attempted in Toronto without success in the past, Now's early decision to be distributed without charge proved to be crucial in its success. Buzz Burza helped develop the free distribution initiative after the paper initially charged 50 cents per copy. The magazine also continues to reflect the editorial slant that Hollett brought to it, notably favouring the New Democratic Party (NDP) politically. In 1995, Hollett became a founder of the North by Northeast (NXNE) music festival. In 2004, he provided the liner notes for a greatest hits CD release by the band Blue Rodeo. Hollett served on the Board of Directors of the Association of Alternative Newsmedia (AAN) a continental organization representing alt weeklies and digital media across North America from 2009 until 2016. He was also a founding member of the Alternative Media Foundation. Hollett resigned from both boards when he resigned from NOW Magazine in 2016. He resigned from NOW to focus on growing NXNE and to spend more time writing. He is a founding board member of Music Canada Live, launched in 2014, and remains active in the association. Hollett continues to travel the world attending music festivals and conferences, often as a speaker, expanding NXNE's contacts and looking for talent to book.

The Burkholderia (previously part of Pseudomonas) genus name refers to a group of virtually ubiquitous Gram-negative, obligately aerobic, rod-shaped bacteria that are motile by means of single or multiple polar flagella, with the exception of Burkholderia mallei, which is nonmotile. Members belonging to the genus do not produce sheaths or prosthecae and are able to use poly-beta-hydroxybutyrate (PHB) for growth. The genus includes both animal and plant pathogens, as well as some environmentally important species. In particular, B. xenovorans (previously named Pseudomonas cepacia then B. cepacia and B. fungorum) is renowned for being catalase positive (affecting patients with chronic granulomatous disease) and its ability to degrade chlororganic pesticides and polychlorinated biphenyls. The conserved RNA structure anti-hemB RNA motif is found in all known bacteria in this genus. Due to their antibiotic resistance and the high mortality rate from their associated diseases, B. mallei and B. pseudomallei are considered to be potential biological warfare agents, targeting livestock and humans. ==History== The genus was named after Walter H. Burkholder, plant pathologist at Cornell University. The first species placed in the genus were transfers from Pseudomonas, on the basis of various biochemical tests. Until recently, the genus Burkholderia was inclusive of all Paraburkholderia species. However, the genus Paraburkholderia is phylogenetically distinct, and can be distinguished from all Burkholderia species on the basis of molecular signatures that are uniquely found for each genus. ==Taxonomy== Burkholderia species form a monophyletic group within the Burkholderiales order of the Betaproteobacteria. Currently, the 48 validly named species can be distinguished from related genera (i.e. Paraburkholderia) and all other bacteria by conserved signature indels in a variety of proteins. These indels represent exclusive common ancestry shared among all Burkholderia species. The genus has three distinct monophyletic clusters. One group consists of all species belonging to the Burkholderia cepacia complex, another clade comprises B. pseudomallei and closely related species, and the last clade encompasses of most of the phytogenic species within the genus, including B. glumae and B. gladioli . Conserved signature indels are specific for each of these subgroups within the genus that aid in demarcating members of this extremely large and diverse genus. ==Species== List of species: *Burkholderia alpina *Burkholderia ambifaria *Burkholderia anthina *Burkholderia arboris *Burkholderia cenocepacia *Burkholderia cepacia *Burkholderia contaminans *Burkholderia diffusa *Burkholderia dolosa *Burkholderia gladioli *Burkholderia glumae *Burkholderia humptydooensis *Burkholderia lata *Burkholderia latens *Burkholderia mallei *Burkholderia metallica *Burkholderia multivorans *Burkholderia oklahomensis *Burkholderia plantarii *Burkholderia pseudomallei *Burkholderia pseudomultivorans *Burkholderia puraquae *Burkholderia pyrrocinia *Burkholderia seminalis *Burkholderia singaporensis *Burkholderia singularis *Burkholderia stabilis *Burkholderia stagnalis *Burkholderia territorii *Burkholderia thailandensis *Burkholderia ubonensis *Burkholderia vietnamiensis ==See also== *MAEB RNA motif ==References== ==External links== * Burkholderia genomes and related information at PATRIC, a Bioinformatics Resource Center funded by NIAID * Pathema-Burkholderia Resource * Burkholderia Genome Database Category:Burkholderiales Category:Bacteria genera Category:Anti-agriculture weapons ","title":"Burkholderia"},{"id":"1283671","text":"Apple iMac Volkswagen New Beetle The Selfridges building (\\"The Blob\\") in Birmingham by architect Jan Kaplicky of Future Systems A blobject is a design product, often a household object, distinguished by smooth flowing curves, bright colors, and an absence of sharp edges. The word is generally held to be a portmanteau, a contraction of \\"blob\\" and \\"object.\\" The origin of the term is disputed, but it is often attributed to either the designer-author Steven Skov Holt or the designer Karim Rashid. Author and design journalist Phil PattonRandom House Bio of Phil Patton attributed the word to Holt in 1993 in Esquire magazine. Holt has defined a blobject as, most often, a colorful, mass-produced, plastic-based, emotionally engaging consumer product with a curvilinear, flowing shape. This fluid and curvaceous form is the blobject's most distinctive feature. Rashid, the contemporary designer who wrote the book I want to Change the World, was an early leader in creating blobjects and has become one of the most celebrated designers of his generation. Blobjects can also be found in most areas of contemporary visual culture. * A blobject can be a typographic font (cf. Neville Brody), an animation (cf. Monica Peon), a piece of furniture (Marc Newson), an article of clothing (Rei Kawakubo), a motorcycle (GK Dynamics), a car (GEMCAR), a building (Future Systems), a painting (Rex Ray), a piece of sculpture (Hadeki Matsumoto), or ceramics work (Ken Price). * Blobjects can be made of any material in any size or scale for the home, office, car, or outdoors. Common materials used in fabricating blobjects are plastic (especially polycarbonate, polypropylene, or polyethylene), metal, and rubber, with the aim being to give a more organic and animate feel. The blobject trend has largely been driven by advances in computer-aided design, information visualization, rapid prototyping, materials, and injection molding. These technologies have given designers the chance to use new shapes and to explore transparency and translucency without significant extra production costs. More recently, in 2004, author Bruce Sterling used the word in the title of his keynote speech at Siggraph.Siggraph 2004 In his speech titled, \\"When Blobjects Rule the Earth\\", Sterling speculated on the future of graphic simulation when practical differences no longer exist between computer generated models and physically manufactured objects. ==Examples of blobjects== * Apple Inc. iMac G3 computer * Volkswagen Beetle * Gillette Mach3 razor * Oral-B toothbrush * Swatch Twinphone ==See also== * Blobitecture * Greg Lynn * Ken Rinaldo ==References== ==Further reading== * Sterling, Bruce, (2002).

It is wholly owned by private and institutional investors. Link REIT's portfolio consists of properties with about 8 million sq ft of retail space, around 56,000 car park spaces, and a project under development in Hong Kong, as well as properties with about 5 million sq ft of retail and office space in Mainland China. ==History== The LINK REIT was created by the government, which hived off assets from the Housing Authority that included 151 retail facilities Housing Authority announces Hong Kong's First REIT Press Release The Link Real Estate Investment Trust (00823) – mainly within public housing estates – and 79,000 parking spaces. The date for the listing was 25 November 2005The Link Real Estate Investment Trust (00823), at a valuation of HK$22.02 billion (Valuation = 2,137,454,000 x HK$10.30 = HK$ 22.02 Billion) (US$2.82 billion)2005/06 The Link Annual Report. Upon privatisation, Link Reit remains tied to terms in existing tenancy agreements, but will not longer require approval from government to increase rents for new leases. However, financial analysts expected attractive dividend yields – up to 7 per cent – from the privatised company and greater commercial orientation, although some feared that the scope for increasing rental income and cutting labour costs might be limited due to most of its properties being tied to the public housing sector. ===Initial public offering=== IPO of The Link REIT, delayed for a year until 2005 through legal action by housing tenants worried that rents would rise, was eventually 18 times oversubscribed.Forbes magazine, 25 November 2005 About 510,000 Hong Kong residents, or seven percent of the city's population, placed US$36 billion of orders while institutional investors were ready to commit US$40 billion. The IPO's joint global coordinators were Goldman Sachs, HSBC Holdings plc, and UBS AG. JPMorgan Chase & Co. was the financial adviser to the Housing AuthorityPlaying the REITs Game: Asia's New Real Estate Investment Trusts Page 22. The proposed flotation of The Link REIT by the Housing Authority was delayed when a public housing tenant, Lo Siu-lan, challenged the legality of the proposed divestment of the properties. HKEX News 2005Sale of public housing facilities lawful: CJ July 20, 2005 Lo's lawyer submitted that the Housing Authority had \\"breached its duty under the Housing Ordinance to provide housing to people in need. Instead, it was selling assets to a private company, which could sublet the properties at market rates rather than benefiting the underprivileged\\". She represented a concern among many residents of public housing that existing amenities would no longer be public and that The Link would raise rents, thereby forcing price rises in shops without due consideration of the public good. Some NGOs also were concerned that the reduced income of the Housing Authority would eventually lead to rent rises for public tenants. Lo's request for judicial review of the privatisation was rejected at the Court of First Instance and the Court of Appeal. Since the listing in 2005, Link has engaged in a process of 'asset enhancement works', seeking to raise the value of the properties through upgraded physical structure, replacing low-end utility local shops with higher-paying brands and chains, enhanced 'customer service', and promotional activities. The Link also overhauled many of the wet markets under its management. The renovations have led to higher rents, higher prices, and the loss of local shops. ===Acquisition of properties=== In moves to diversify its property portfolio and mix, Link acquired the shopping mall portion of Nan Fung Centre with parking facilities in Hang Hau, from Nan Fung Group mid 2010 for a total of $1.17 billion. In late 2010, Link acquired the shopping mall portion of Maritime Bay Shopping Mall with parking facilities in Hang Hau, from Sino Group, for a total of $588.4 millionThe Link Real Estate Investment Trust PROPOSED ACQUISITION OF PROPERTY HKEX In mid 2014, Link acquired The Lions Rise Mall with parking facilities in Wong Tai Sin, from Kerry Properties, for a total of $1.38 billion. In 2015, The Link took its first step in purchasing by government land auction when it partnered with Nan Fung Group to buy land lot NKIL 6512 in Kwun Tong for a total of $5.86 billion in January. Then, Link surprised the market by successively making its first two purchases in mainland China, when it acquired Beijing EC Mall, for a consideration of ¥2.5 billion; it acquired two commercial buildings in Shanghai for ¥6.6 billion. The company has a target where mainland properties would not exceed 12.5% of its portfolio. On 19 February 2016, a subsidiary of the Link purchased the Trade and Industry Department Tower in Mong Kok (formerly the Argyle Centre Tower II) from the government for a sum of HK$5.91 billion. ===Sale of properties=== In mid-2014 Link REIT sold four commercial properties, to four different buyers, for a total of $1.24 billion. The properties are Hing Tin Commercial Centre (in Lam Tin), Kwai Hing Shopping Centre (Kwai Chung), the Tung Hei Court shopping centre (Shau Kei Wan), and Wah Kwai Shopping Centre (Pokfulam). In late 2015 they sold five properties, namely: Fung Wah Estate Retail and Car Park, Ka Fuk Shopping Centre, Kwong Tin Shopping Centre, Siu On Court Retail and Car Park, and Tin Wan Shopping Centre. In late 2016 they sold five properties again, namely: Sui Wo Court Commercial Centre, On Yam Shopping Centre, Sun Tin Wai Commercial Centre, Cheung Hong Commercial Centre and Shek Wai Kok Commercial Centre. ===Green Bond=== In July 2016, Link REIT issue a green convertible bonds, raising US$500 million at 2.875% fixed rate due 2026.Hong Kong’s Link Reit issues US$500 million green bondLink REIT raises $510 mln in largest green convertible bond globally ===Renaming=== On 19 August 2015, Link officially announces the changing of its corporate names. ==Criticism== ===Economic hardship on lower classes=== The Link was called a \\"bloodsucker\\" by housing estate residents after the company acquired the Housing Authority shopping centres, renovated them, and raised rents. This has led to local shops being pushed out, higher prices, and the dominance of chain stores within the estates. This trend has reduced entrepreneurship opportunities for lower income people in Hong Kong's public housing estates and new towns, diminishing their chances to achieve social mobility, and has increased the cost of living. A 2012 campaign by The Link to promote \\"nostalgic restaurants\\" in its shopping centres was widely derided on social media as hypocritical. Users on Golden Forum and Facebook wrote that the company \\"first killed the shops, then makes money from their death\\" and criticised the company for only allowing chain stores in their properties. In 2006, The Link cut thousands of staff, a move \\"fiercely criticised by unionists, who said Link Management had dishonoured a pledge to protect the welfare of its frontline workers when it took over the operation from the Housing Authority\\". The Link replied that \\"the job cuts were in line with private practice\\". By mid 2015, NGO Link Watch () published a report that showed big chains made up 76 per cent of the 2,075 shops in 22 shopping centres run by the firm, but the Link's CEO claimed, \\"We continue to maintain roughly 60 per cent of our shops leased to smaller operators.\\" Anti-Link REIT protests have become increasingly common in recent years. Link REIT headquarters in Kwun Tong has been the site of demonstrations, scuffles, and sit-ins, leading the company to seek a court order to bar activists from entering the building. ===Market management=== Cheung Fat Market, rebranded by The Link as \\"Cheung Fat Modern Market\\" In addition to indoor shopping centres, The Link also acquired many local estate markets in 2005. Such markets are covered facilities with small stalls and shops let out to local residents, generally offering fresh meat and vegetables as well as daily necessities and home wares. As with the shopping centres, The Link has raised rents and also renovated some properties, leading to increased food prices and financial hardship on low-income households. In Tin Shui Wai, where The Link exercises a near-monopoly on commercial space, the company was criticised by local residents and Legislative Councillors in 2015–16 for planning to convert the Tin Yiu Market into a conventional shopping centre. The market supplies fresh vegetables, meat, and fish to residents of the surrounding public housing estates. The next closest market is 5 to 10 minutes' walk away. Stall operators at Cheung Fat Estate on Tsing Yi have gone on strike, in 2010 and 2016, to protest rent increases. By the latter strike it was reported that rents had doubled in ten years. Some local residents stated that they visit a government-run market in Tsuen Wan instead owing to the higher prices at Cheung Fat. The Cheung Fat stall owners also protested the outsourcing of the market's management to Uni-China (Market) Management Limited, which they feared will lead to untenable rent increases. Barriers set up by management at Leung King Estate against hawkers Uni-China (Market) Management also manages the market at Leung King Estate in Tuen Mun, which is also owned by The Link. In February 2016 a group of men dressed in dark jackets with \\"manager\\" (管理員) printed on the backs acted in an intimidating manner toward hawkers in the area of the shopping centre since 2 February. More than 200 showed up to protest against the men combating hawkers on the night of 8 February. Some minor clashes broke out between the self-proclaimed managers and the protesters, and required mediation by the police. Two protesters were arrested and one reporter was injured during the clash. Conflicts between the management and the public reoccurred on the night of 9 February. The men were filmed beating up protesters while police stood by and prevented others from being involved. A reporter was also beaten up by the control team. A 31-year-old man was arrested for causing disorder in a public place. He allegedly interfered with a worker performing his duties at Leung King Estate. The Link REIT distanced itself from the clashes and denied the hawker control team was part of its staff. ===Illegal wastewater discharges=== In 2016 the Environmental Protection Department initiated prosecution against the Link REIT under the Water Pollution Control Ordinance because wastewater from the Mei Lam Shopping Centre, owned and managed by the Link, was being illegally discharged into the Shing Mun River. The company was fined $15,000 in November 2016 and ordered to rectify the situation immediately. ===History of monopoly=== Due to its history of monopoly, controversial business ethics and unfriendly treatment to small business owners and investors, According to Richard Harris's opinion, Link Reit has been widely considered a \\"corporate monster\\" in Hong Kong partly responsible for the city's socioeconomic issues. ==Government response== Carrie Lam, now chief executive, has called Link REIT one of the \\"three mountains\\" facing Hong Kong society Link REIT has been widely condemned by officials on both sides of the political spectrum. Starry Lee, chairperson of the pro-Beijing DAB, reported that former chief executive Leung Chun-ying \\"strongly criticised\\" Link REIT in a meeting with the DAB. In an interview with the South China Morning Post, Leung questioned whether the remuneration structure for top management of Link REIT had led to the trust's behaviour. He said that, as the previous owner of the public housing commercial space, the Hong Kong government has a responsibility to public housing tenants \\"to satisfy their needs and if necessary to provide alternatives to Link REIT properties\\". He said that a Link REIT monopoly in public estates was not acceptable as elderly tenants could not be expected to carry their heavy shopping to and from other markets. He said there was no plan to buy back the Link, but the government could explore providing alternatives if the Link was not serving nearby residents. Carrie Lam, now chief executive, was reported in 2016 (while she was chief secretary) to have called Link REIT one of the \\"three mountains\\" – i.e. one of the major sources of contention in Hong Kong society – that the government sought to conquer. Lam stated that the government should explore different avenues toward tackling the problem, including launching a potential legal battle against the company. Similarly, in April 2019, legislator Alice Mak moved a motion in the Legislative Council urging the government to \\"overcome the 'three big mountains'\\" that she wrote had plagued the local community, one of which is Link REIT. Various other legislators moved motions to this amendment suggesting means of tackling the problem, including amending the Housing Ordinance to regulate rent increases; constructing more public markets and bazaars to diminish Link REIT's commercial monopoly in many areas, and provide residents with greater shopping choices; creating a dedicated team within the Lands Department to inspect Link REIT properties, and to conduct enforcement against violations of land lease conditions by the company; and buying back Link REIT properties and placing them back under government management. ==See also== * Privatisation * Securitisation – see \\"government securitisation\\" ==References== ==External links== * Category:Companies listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange Category:Politics of Hong Kong Category:Public housing in Hong Kong Category:Real estate investment trusts of Hong Kong Category:Government- controlled corporations of Hong Kong Category:Companies in the Hang Seng Index ","title":"Link REIT"},{"id":"1283675","text":"Christopher James Priest (born James Christopher Owsley June 30, 1961Additional on July 10, 2012. in Queens, New York) is an American writer of comic books who is at times credited simply as Priest.

They would work again on the first issue of Green Lantern: Emerald Dawn before Owsley departed. He edited several titles in DC Comics' Impact Comics imprint from 1991 to 1993. As a writer, Owsley/Priest worked on the series Conan the Barbarian, King Conan, The Ray, Steel, Deadpool, and Black Panther vol. 3. He co-created the series Quantum and Woody, Xero, and The Crew, among others. In 1993, he became part of the group of writers and artists that launched Milestone Media, a comic book publisher affiliated with DC Comics. He has said he was intended to become the company's editor-in- chief, but personal problems forced him to scale down his involvement to liaison between DC and Milestone. Shortly afterward, he changed his name from \\"Jim Owsley\\" to \\"Christopher Priest\\" for reasons he has not discussed publicly other than in one interview's seemingly glib remark about becoming a priest if his marriage, which later ended in divorce, did not last. During Owsley's Green Lantern run, prior to his name change, he introduced a character named Priest. He has stated he was unaware of the British science fiction novelist Christopher Priest. He refers to himself professionally as either the mononym \\"Priest\\" or \\"Christopher J. Priest\\". After a decade-long absence from comics, he returned in 2014–2015 to write a Quantum and Woody miniseries for Valiant Comics. He was chosen to write the DC Rebirth version of Deathstroke in 2016. He became the writer for Justice League in December 2017, but was replaced by Scott Snyder in 2018. Priest contributed a story to the Black Panther Annual No. 1, released in February 2018. He is currently writing Vampirella for Dynamite Comics. In addition to comic books, Priest has written several novels. ==Music== Priest is also a singer-songwriter and multi-instrumentalist music producer who has written and produced dozens of tracks for himself and others. Streetwise, Priest's first solo album, recorded under the stage name \\"Hollis Stone,\\" was released on vinyl on March 3, 1981. It featured a cover photo by Eliot R. Brown of the then-Jim Owsley standing in front of the Marvel Comics office building at 575 Madison Avenue. In 1993, Priest co-produced Live! Minister Darryl Cherry and the Covenant Mass Choir (RWM-4445), a full concert multitrack recording featuring an 85-voice choir and 10-piece band including Priest playing bass guitar on two selections. The album was recorded before a live concert audience in New Brunswick, New Jersey. ==Personal life== Priest is an ordained Baptist minister, and maintains an extensive archive of Progressive Christian ecumenical essays on his website PraiseNet.Org. Priest resides in Denver, Colorado. ==Bibliography== ===Comics=== ====Regular writer==== *The Marvel No-Prize Book No. 1 (Marvel Comics, January 1983) – (one-shot) *Falcon #1–4 (Marvel Comics,

The company was founded in 1988 and is headquartered in Shenzhen. \\"Ping An\\" literally means \\"safe and well\\". Ping An ranked 7th on the Forbes Global 2000 list and 29th on the Fortune Global 500 list. The company is considered to be China's biggest insurer, with US$107 billion in gross premium income in 2018. Its market capitalization is at US$220 billion in July 2019, making it the world's largest insurer except for Berkshire Hathaway. Ping An Insurance is one of the top 50 companies in the Shanghai Stock Exchange. It is also a constituent stock of Hang Seng Index, an index of the top 50 companies in the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. Ping An Insurance was also included in the pan-China stock indices CSI 300 Index, FTSE China A50 Index and Hang Seng China 50 Index. Ping An Insurance has been selected for the 2019 Dow Jones Sustainability Emerging Markets Index (DJSI). It was the first insurance company from mainland China to be selected on the index. Ping An is a signatory of the United Nations-supported Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI), and was the first asset owner in mainland China to join. Ping An Insurance consistently ranks as the world's top global insurance brand, and as of 2018, was the third most valuable global financial brand in the world. ==Business== Ping An Insurance Group started off in 1988 as a property and casualty insurance company, later diversifying into life insurance, banking, asset management, brokerage services, and private equity investing. The company's embrace of technology through its utilization of an array of financial technology platforms and services for customers has made it a diversified financial conglomerate. Ping An is one of the few companies in China with licenses to offer a full suite of financial services, including insurance, banking, trusts, securities, futures and financial leasing. Since the mid-1990s, Ping An has been diversifying into financial services from its core business of insurance, and has subsequently taken investments from overseas firms such as Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs in 1994. In 2002 HSBC took a large equity interest in Ping An. In early 2008, Ping An agreed to take a 50% share in Fortis Investments, a subsidiary of Fortis,The Ping An-Fortis Deal: Who Really Wins? , Caijing Magazine, 3 April 2008 which had taken over ABN AMRO Asset Management as a result of the split up of ABN AMRO in late 2007; the deal was canceled in October 2008. In June 2009, Ping An became a strategic investor in Shenzhen Development Bank, (now part of Ping An Bank). In 2016, Ping An invested more overseas. In January in 2017, Deputy Head Cai Lifeng resigned for personal reasons. ===Technology-Powered Business Transformation=== Ping An invests 1% of its revenues into R&D; (which itself consists of 10% of its annual profits), specifically, on new technologies of AI, Blockchain and Cloud Computing for ten years to transform its financial services and support the building of its five ecosystems: financial services, healthcare, auto services, real estate services, and smart city services. More than 576 million users and 100 Chinese cities are connected to at least one of those ecosystems. Over the years, Ping An has successfully launched fintech and healthtech businesses such as Lufax Holding, OneConnect, Ping An Good Doctor (1833.HK), and Ping An HealthKonnect. Supporting Business Development with Three Core Technologies *AI: With the philosophy of “change people’s lives for the better in ways and forms”, Ping An is applying its AI technologies in financial, healthcare and smart city services. Ping An has world-leading facial, voiceprint and medical image recognition technologies. It is number one in AI medical imaging, for instance, with more than 95% accuracy in the authoritative LUNA rankings for imaging in two categories for lung diseases. *Blockchain: Ping An's OneConnect platform is one of the largest commercial blockchain platform in the world with over 44,000 blockchain nodes providing services to over 3,000 financial institutions. Through its self-developed FiMAX proprietary blockchain technology, its zero- knowledge proof algorithm and low latency design is able to reach 50,000 transactions per second. *Cloud Computing: Ping An Cloud offers efficient and secure services for industries in finance, health care, auto, real estate and smart city. In 2018, Ping An Cloud successfully became GitHub's first managed serviced provider (MSP) in Greater China. GitHub will provide GitHub Enterprise products and services to China enterprises through Ping An Cloud. ==Ownership== Ping An is a publicly listed company. It is China's first joint- stock insurance company. Beginning in the 1990s, Ping An took advantage of widening reforms to become the first Chinese financial institution in which foreign firms could own equity: Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were early backers. The company eventually went public in 2004, listing in Hong Kong and subsequently also listed in Shanghai in 2007. As at 30 June 2020, Charoen Pokphand Group is the biggest investor in Ping An, holding 8.81% stake. Shenzhen Government via Shenzhen Investment Holdings () and Shum Yip Group (), still owned a combined 6.68% stake (5.27% + 1.41%) as the second largest shareholder. Ping An has the classification of a civilian-run enterprise. Richard McGregor, author of The Party: The Secret World of China's Communist Rulers, said that \\"the true ownership of large chunks of its shares remains unclear\\" and that the ownership of Ping An is a \\"murky structure\\".McGregor, p. 204 -205. In October 2012, The New York Times reported that relatives and associates of Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao controlled stakes in Ping An worth at least US$2.2 billion in 2007.David Barboza, \\"Billions in Hidden Riches for Family of Chinese Leader\\" , The New York Times, 25 October 2012. Retrieved 27 October 2012. They paid the equivalent of 40 cents a share, others buying at the same time paid as much as $1.20. Thanks to favorable regulatory treatment and licensing, the firm was able to build a diversified financial firm with interests in insurance, brokerage, and banking. Premier Wen Jiabao's family responded to The New York Time's report, claiming its statement about their family's wealth is \\"untrue\\". Two lawyers later released a statement on behalf of Wen's family denying the other claims made, and asserting that the premier's 90-year-old mother has never held a US$120 million of Ping An Insurance's investment, as the paper had reported. HSBC acquired 48.22% of H shares by means of different HSBC subsidiaries (H share accounted for 34.83% of the share capital as at 31 December 2009, which was later increased to 41.88% in 2015 ). HSBC hold 16.80% of total shares of Ping An, making itself the biggest shareholder at 31 December 2009. On 5 December 2012, HSBC announced to sell their entire 15.57% stake for HK$72.736 billion (approx. US$9.385 billion; HK$59.00 per share) to Thailand conglomerate Charoen Pokphand. The deal would split into two phases, which the latter was subjected to the clearance from China Insurance Regulatory Commission, which would be paid in cash and a loan from China Development Bank to Charoen Pokphand. In February 2013 Charoen Pokphand got the clearance. On 10 May in spite of a lack of loan from the state-owned China Development Bank to Charoen Pokphand, the deal was completed. According to HSBC, the transaction would increase Tier 1 Capital ratio of the bank for 0.5%, as well as a post-tax gain of US$2.6 billion. HSBC had an above average forecasted CET1 ratio of 8.5% in 2011 European Union bank stress test under the adverse scenario, nevertheless HSBC chose to strengthen its capital by selling Ping An. The actual ratio at 31 December 2012 was 12.3%, increased 2.2% year-to-yearly. == Markets == Since 24 June 2004 Ping An has been listed on the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong (subsidiary of Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing) as . Since 1 March 2007, it has a listing on the Shanghai Stock Exchange as . Ping An was chosen as an index stock of the Hang Seng China Enterprises Index (HSCEI), replacing Anhui Expressway in 2004. The Hang Seng Index Services Company announced on 11 May 2007 that Ping An would join as Hang Seng Index Constituent Stock (Blue Chip Stock) effective on 4 June 2007. == Operations == Ping An has operations across all of the People's Republic of China, and in Hong Kong and Macau through Ping An Insurance Overseas. Lufax, OneConnect and Ping An Good Doctor have now expanded overseas. OneConnect is in 10 countries outside of China, serving about 27 top institutional financials. == Notes == == External links == * Company web site 1 * New building under construction, ready in 2016 * Company web site 2 * News website about Ping An systems upgrade Category:Financial services companies established in 1988 Category:Companies listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange Category:Companies listed on the Shanghai Stock Exchange Category:Companies in the CSI 100 Index Category:Financial services companies of China Category:Companies in the Hang Seng Index Category:H shares Category:Companies based in Shenzhen Category:Insurance companies of China Category:Chinese companies established in 1988 Category:Chinese brands Category:Charoen Pokphand Category:Multinational companies headquartered in China Category:Civilian-run enterprises of China ","title":"Ping An Insurance"},{"id":"1283699","text":"Fallingwater by Frank Lloyd Wright Försters Weinterrassen by Udo Heimermann, Bad Neuenahr-Ahrweiler (2000) Organic architecture is a philosophy of architecture which promotes harmony between human habitation and the natural world. This is achieved through design approaches that aim to be sympathetic and well-integrated with a site, so buildings, furnishings, and surroundings become part of a unified, interrelated composition. An organicist is an architect in the organic movement. ==History== The term \\"organic architecture\\" was coined by Frank Lloyd Wright (1867–1959), though never well-articulated by his cryptic style of writing: > So here I stand before you preaching organic architecture: declaring organic > architecture to be the modern ideal and the teaching so much needed if we > are to see the whole of life and to now serve the whole of life, holding no > traditions essential to the great TRADITION. Nor cherishing any preconceived > form fixing upon us either past, present, or future, but instead exalting > the simple laws of common sense or of super-sense if you prefer determining > form by way of the nature of materials...Frank Lloyd Wright (1954). The > Natural House (New York: Bramhall House), p. 3 Postage stamp featuring \\"Metso\\", the Tampere Central Library in Finland, by Reima and Raili Pietilä. Organic architecture is also translated into the all- inclusive nature of Wright's design process. Materials, motifs, and basic ordering principles continue to repeat themselves throughout the building as a whole. The idea of organic architecture refers not only to the buildings' literal relationship to the natural surroundings, but how the buildings' design is carefully thought about as if it were a unified organism. Geometries throughout Wright's buildings build a central mood and theme. Essentially organic architecture is also the literal design of every element of a building: From the windows to the floors, to the individual chairs intended to fill the space. Everything relates to one another, reflecting the symbiotic ordering systems of nature.Sokolina, Anna P. \\"Biology in Architecture: the Goetheanum Case Study.\\" In: The Routledge Companion to Biology in Art and Architecture, edited by Ch. Terranova and M. Tromble, 52-70. New York and London: Routledge, 2017. 546p. Other modernist architects in the U.S., Europe, and elsewhere held complementarily and often competing views of how architecture could best emulate nature. Key figures in the U.S. included Louis Sullivan, Claude Bragdon, Eugene Tsui and Paul Laffoley while among European modernists Hugo Häring, Hans Scharoun, and Rudolf SteinerPaull, John (2020). The First Goetheanum: A Centenary for Organic Architecture, Journal of Fine Arts. 3 (2): 1-11 stand out. Following World War II, organic architecture often reflected cybernetic and informatic models of life, as is reflected in the later work of futurist architect Buckminster Fuller. Architect and planner David Pearson proposed a list of rules towards the design of organic architecture. These rules are known as the Gaia Charter for organic architecture and design. It reads: Catholic church, Paks by Imre Makovecz \\"Let the design: * be inspired by nature and be sustainable, healthy, conserving, and diverse. * unfold, like an organism, from the seed within. * exist in the \\"continuous present\\" and \\"begin again and again\\". * follow the flows and be flexible and adaptable. * satisfy social, physical, and spiritual needs. * \\"grow out of the site\\" and be unique. * celebrate the spirit of youth, play, and surprise. * express the rhythm of music and the power of dance.\\"Pearson, David (2001). The Breaking Wave: New Organic Architecture (Stroud: Gaia), p. 72 Exposed bedrock at the Rådhuset metro station A well- known example of organic architecture is Fallingwater, the residence Wright designed for the Kaufmann family in rural Pennsylvania. Wright had many choices to locate a home on this large site but chose to place the home directly over the waterfall and creek creating a close, yet noisy dialog with the rushing water and the steep site. The horizontal striations of stone masonry with daring cantilevers of colored beige concrete blend with native rock outcroppings and the wooded environment. In postwar Europe, the Hungarian Imre Makovecz was one of the most prominent proponents of organic architecture. There are contemporary creations of organic architecture. The definition of 'organic' has dramatically changed during recent times. Avoiding materials of construction that require more embodied energy to build and sustain it, when the building blends naturally and sits seamlessly to its surroundings, reflecting cultural continuity, it is 'organic' and is idealistic. Examples include leaving natural material, such as bedrock, exposed and unsculptured, such as the underground Rådhuset metro station in Stockholm, which appears to occupy a natural cave system. ==See also== *Complementary architecture *Biomorphism *Metaphoric architecture *Zoomorphic architecture ==ReferencesBureau for organic architecture - Udo Heimermann Category:Architectural styles Category:20th- century architectural styles * ","title":"Organic architecture"},{"id":"1283701","text":"John Garlick Llewellyn Poulson (14 April 1910 – 31 January 1993) was a British architectural designer and businessman who caused a major political scandal when his use of bribery was disclosed in 1972. The highest-ranking figure to be forced out due to the scandal was Conservative Home Secretary Reginald Maudling. Poulson served a prison sentence, but continued to protest his innocence, claiming that he was \\"a man more sinned against than sinning\\".John Poulson The Price, Michael Joseph, 1981 ==Family and early life== Poulson came from a strict Methodist family and inherited a strong faith which stressed the importance of self-help. He did badly at school and at Leeds College of Art but nevertheless was articled to a Pontefract firm of architects, Garside and Pennington. He left to start his own architecture practice with financial backing from his father. He never registered with the ARCUK (Architects' Registration Council of the United Kingdom), later claiming \\"I was too busy to complete my examinations\\". Poulson soon began to cultivate contacts in the local borough council and officials at the larger West Riding County Council. Work soon began to arrive and Poulson told friends that he was \\"on his way\\". Poulson also became politically involved with the National Liberals, although he never let political differences stop him from making friends who were in charge of commissioning public buildings. He was a Freemason.\\"PROPOSITIONS : Revealing the silent minority\\", The Independent, 23 February 1995 ==Post-war business== Manasseh, Poulson's former residence Poulson obtained a medical exemption from wartime service in 1939. The same year he married Cynthia Sykes whose sister Lorna was married to John King, Baron King of Wartnaby. He was thus well placed to expand his business throughout the wartime years. He was a workaholic and demanded the same commitment from his staff, dismissing staff who would not work his way. He had his own firm build him a house called 'Manasseh' at a cost of £60,000, helped by building contractors donating services for free in the hope of getting contracts in the future. The house won the 'Ideal Homes' House of the Year competition in 1958. When Poulson's problems caught up with him in later life, he sold the house to a young couple for just over half the build cost. Poulson revolutionised the accepted architectural method of completing a design then handing it over for costing, planning and building. He developed a combined architecture and design practice, an all-in-one service which employed all the separate disciplines in integrated teams. This approach facilitated the development process and reduced costs. In the post-war years Poulson's business boomed and by the sixties was one of the largest in Europe at the time. He later admitted that the practice expanded \\"beyond my wildest dreams\\" and offices were opened in London, Middlesbrough, Newcastle upon Tyne, Edinburgh, Beirut and Lagos, Nigeria. ==Local authorities== Poulson's Leeds International Swimming Pool, opened in 1966 Poulson designed Pontefract Library in his home town. The library opened in 1975. Luke Williams House is the centrepiece to the Horsefair flats in Pontefract, designed by Poulson. The pitched roof was added later In 1958, the National Liberal MP Sir Herbert Butcher advised his friend Poulson to set up a servicing company to win business for his architect's practice. Poulson established Ropergate Services Ltd., named after the street in Pontefract where he was based. This company also had the advantage of reducing Poulson's tax liability considerably. In the late 1950s, there was a building boom as many local authorities embarked on major building schemes. In Newcastle upon Tyne, council leader T. Dan Smith's ambition to redevelop Newcastle attracted the attention of the construction firm Bovis which had worked for Poulson. Bovis' managing director suggested formalising links and in February 1962 Smith was appointed as a consultant to the Poulson organisation. This connection was extremely valuable to Poulson as Smith had a network of contacts among other authorities in the north-east, many of whom were also recruited as Poulson consultants. Smith's involvement with the Labour Party reassured many Labour councillors wary of dealing with someone involved in the Conservative-allied National Liberals. Poulson also won other public sector work in the North East, such as Sunderland Police Station. Poulson also found a useful contact in Andrew Cunningham, a senior figure in both the General and Municipal Workers Union and the Labour Party in North East England. Some of Poulson's largest residential blocks were built in Cunningham's home town of Felling, County Durham. Cunningham later went to prison for his dealings with the architect. Poulson's work in Felling consisted of the building of one 16-storey high-rise apartment block with six seven-storey blocks of mainsonettes surrounding. These were approved in 1966. Four of the low-rise mainsonette blocks were demolished in 1987 owing to their poor state of repair and unpopularity with tenants. Two mainsonette blocks and the high-rise block Crowhall Tower remain. In his home town of Pontefract, Poulson won much local authority work for the then Pontefract Municipal Borough Council; such as the town's library and the Horsefair flats, a high- rise social housing project consisting of four six-storey blocks and one twelve-storey block constructed between 1963 and 64 which has proved controversial owing to its proximity to Pontefract Castle. ==Nationalised industries== Cannon Street railway station, a Poulson building City House (originally British Railways House) over Leeds City railway station was a Poulson building design built in 1962. Poulson was also in a good position to win work for the nationalised industries, partly due to his having offered gifts to many civil servants when they were relatively junior and calling upon them for a return of gratitude years in the future. As an example Poulson had met Graham Tunbridge, a railway employee, during the war. After the nationalisation of British Rail Tunbridge became estates surveyor for its Eastern Region and sent Poulson several contracts for modernisation of stationmasters' homes. When Tunbridge became Estates and Rating Surveyor for BR Southern Region, Poulson moved on to contracts at Waterloo railway station, Cannon Street station and East Croydon station. In return, Poulson had at first supplied Tunbridge with £25 weekly, and later loaned him a Rover car. Another productive contact was Scottish Office civil servant George Pottinger, who in the late 1950s was put in charge of a £3 million redevelopment of Aviemore as a winter sports complex. Poulson gave Pottinger gifts worth over £30,000 over six years, and was appointed by Pottinger as architect in charge of the Aviemore project. Pottinger also had a degree of political knowledge and skill which Poulson lacked, and drafted political speeches for him. Poulson's connections with the National Liberals began to give him political advancement in the early 1960s. He was Vice-Chairman of the Executive Committee of the National Liberal Council from 1961 and frequently hosted National Liberal events in London at which he met senior government ministers. He also made contact with the Labour MP Albert Roberts, for whom Poulson designed a house free of charge. Roberts had useful contacts with the Portuguese government and was offered a consultancy by Poulson at £2,500 per annum. ==Overseas work== Poulson was increasingly interested in obtaining commissions outside Britain in the mid-1960s. This required making more contacts. The Conservative MP John Cordle had extensive contacts in West Africa and after helping on several small contracts, in 1965 became a consultant to Poulson at £1,000 per annum. However, Cordle's approaches to governments in Nigeria, the Gambia and Libya proved unfruitful. Cordle wrote a letter outlining everything he had done for Poulson, which eventually doomed his Parliamentary career. ==Maudling== Another contact was the then Shadow Commonwealth Secretary Reginald Maudling, whom Poulson knew from his National Liberal activities. Maudling was anxious to build up a business career to keep up his income and Poulson needed a big name as chairman of one of his companies, Construction Promotion. In 1966 Maudling accepted an offer to be chairman for £5,000 per annum. In addition, Maudling's son Martin, who had left Oxford University without taking a degree, went to work for another Poulson company. Poulson agreed to donate large sums of money to a charity patronised by Maudling's wife. In return, Maudling helped to bring pressure on the government of Malta to award a £1.5 million contract for the new Victoria Hospital on Gozo to Poulson. In Parliament, Maudling vociferously opposed the plans of the Labour government to reduce the amount of defence spending and number of UK troops in Malta. He traded on the goodwill this created to bring extra pressure, and also changed Conservative Party policy so that overseas development assistance to Malta would be 75% grant and 25% loan, instead of the even split which the Labour government had introduced. ==Financial trouble== Poulson's business model was initially highly successful and, at its apogee, was making an annual turnover of £1 million; he himself admitted to being a millionaire. However, it was consuming more contract work than was becoming available, and Poulson resorted to tackling these difficulties by bribing and corrupting local councillors, local authority officials and civil servants at all levels. This was an expensive strategy and Poulson later estimated that he \\"gave away\\" about £500,000 in the last few years of his involvement in the business. As part of his attempts to get noticed, Poulson had become a local Commissioner of Taxes. However, his own tax payments were seriously in deficit by the mid-1960s, mainly due to his extravagance on consultancies and gifts. In January 1968 the Inland Revenue finally decided to sue Poulson; on 18 November 1968 they obtained judgment in their favour for £211,639. Poulson struggled on, but in June 1969 his staff confronted him with the fact that he was approaching bankruptcy. He attempted to recoup cash he had poured into subsidiary companies, which alerted his consultants that all was not well. Maudling and his son quietly resigned in November 1969. On 31 December 1969 Poulson was formally removed from control of J.G.L. Poulson and Associates. On 9 November 1971, he filed his own bankruptcy petition, revealing debts of £247,000. The bankruptcy hearings in spring 1972 were assisted by Poulson's meticulous record-keeping which detailed his payments and gifts. Poulson's generosity drew the comment from Muir Hunter QC during the bankruptcy proceedings that \\"[i]n fact, Mr Poulson, you were distributing largesse like Henry VIII\\". The bankruptcy hearing also revealed Poulson's love for a lavish lifestyle and his penchant for rubbing shoulders with senior figures in the establishment. This desire to show his financial superiority over others only served to highlight his true character as a lonely, friendless and insecure person. One of Poulson's biggest creditors was the Inland Revenue to which he owed around £200,000. Whilst the Revenue were pressing Poulson for payment of this amount, he was himself presiding over debt hearings in Wakefield in his role as a Commissioner of Inland Revenue. It swiftly became apparent that Poulson was at the centre of a massive corruption scandal, and in July 1972, the Metropolitan Police began an investigation for fraud. This precipitated the resignation of Reginald Maudling, then Home Secretary and notionally in charge of the police. ==Dénouement== On 22 June 1973, Poulson was arrested and charged with corruption in connection with the award of building contracts. The trial at Leeds Crown Court lasted 52 days, and cost an estimated £1.25 million. Defending Poulson, QC Donald Herrod, said: \\"He has nothing to live for and his abiding fear is that he will never complete his sentence because of ill health\\". Donald Herrod later described his client as \\"hypocritical, self-righteous and perhaps something of a megalomaniac\\". Following the trial which was widely reported in the press, he was convicted on 11 February 1974 of fraud and jailed for five years (later increased to seven years). Sentencing him, the judge called Poulson an \\"incalculably evil man\\". For his part, Poulson denied the charges, saying \\"I have been a fool, surrounded by a pack of leeches. I took on the world on its own terms, and no one can deny I once had it in my fist\\". Many of his contacts, in particular T. Dan Smith and George Pottinger, were similarly convicted and gaoled, though not the three MPs: it was found that there was a legal loophole through which members of parliament could not be considered as in charge of public funds. The Poulson scandals did much to force the House of Commons to initiate a Register of Members' Interests. A subsequent Select Committee inquiry which reported in 1977 found that all three had indulged in \\"conduct inconsistent with the standards which the House is entitled to expect from its Members\\". Cordle was forced to resign although the Commons then voted only to 'take note' of the Committee's report rather than endorsing it. After serving periods in Armley Gaol, Wakefield and Oakham prisons, Poulson was released on 13 May 1977 from Lincoln Prison after Lord Longford had appealed on his behalf. Longford had successfully argued that to keep a sick man in gaol was an \\"indefensible cruelty\\". His bankruptcy was discharged, with creditors receiving 10p in the pound, in 1980. A condition of the discharge was that half the proceeds of his autobiography would go to his creditors; the resulting book, The Price, gives his side of the corruption scandal and maintains his innocence. Only a few copies of the book remain in circulation as it was withdrawn and pulped by the publishers through fear of libel actions. Throughout the rest of his life Poulson said that he was simply developing advanced public relations and consulting techniques. Poulson died in the General Infirmary in Pontefract, West Yorkshire, on 31 January 1993. His wife and two daughters survived him. ==Contributions== Among buildings designed by Poulson are the City House (1962) and International Pool (1965–1968), both in Leeds, and Forster House in Bradford, which was demolished in 2005 as part of the Forster Square redevelopment. The International Pool in Leeds was closed in 2007 and razed to the ground in 2009. The site is now used for car parking. In an indirect way, Poulson did make a contribution to the UK's broadcasting culture. A special edition of the investigative ITV series World in Action, The Friends and Influence of John L Poulson, became a cause célèbre in the debate about the power of Britain's television regulators to interfere with broadcast journalism. The Poulson programme was banned by the then regulator, the ITA, even though its members had not seen it. A furious debate followed in which newspapers as varied as The Sunday Times and Socialist Worker united in calling for an end to such \\"censorship\\". Granada Television, the makers of World in Action, broadcast a blank screen as a protest against the banning. There was some irony in this: the editor of World in Action was Raymond Fitzwalter who earlier, as deputy news editor of the Telegraph & Argus in Bradford, had led an investigation into Poulson's activities, which the newspaper published. Eventually, after the film was shown to the ITA, it was transmitted on 30 April 1973, three months late, and under a different title, The Rise and Fall of John Poulson. The 1996 BBC television drama serial Our Friends in the North, written by Peter Flannery, contains a character, John Edwards (played by Geoffrey Hutchings), who is closely based on Poulson. One of the reasons the production took so long to reach the screen—Flannery had originally written it for the stage in 1982—was the fear of the BBC that Poulson and others fictionalised in the drama might take legal action. In the event, the deaths of Poulson and T. Dan Smith in 1993 finally allowed the production to commence.Flannery, Peter. Retrospective – An interview with the creators of the series.

By independent selections of half-space signs, there are 2n orthants in n-dimensional space. More specifically, a closed orthant in Rn is a subset defined by constraining each Cartesian coordinate to be nonnegative or nonpositive. Such a subset is defined by a system of inequalities: :ε1x1 ≥ 0 ε2x2 ≥ 0 * * * εnxn ≥ 0, where each εi is +1 or −1\\\\. Similarly, an open orthant in Rn is a subset defined by a system of strict inequalities :ε1x1 > 0 ε2x2 > 0 * * * εnxn > 0, where each εi is +1 or −1.

In the 2016/17 academic year, the university has just under 11,000 students. The university offers degree courses in a variety of disciplines. Study is available at undergraduate and postgraduate levels, full-time and part-time, and research opportunities are offered. Cardiff Metropolitan University has a number of research and enterprise centres, including the Food Industry Centre, the Welsh Centre for Tourism Research, and the National Centre for Product Design and Development Research. ==History== ===Predecessor institutions=== In 1865 the Cardiff School of Art opened in the Old Free Library Building, St Mary Street. The School of Art moved to the Technical Buildings in Dumfries Place in 1900, then The Friary in 1949, then to a new campus in Howard Gardens in 1965. In 1940, Cardiff College of Food Technology and Commerce opened at Crwys Road. The Cardiff College of Food Technology and Commerce moved to a new Colchester Avenue Campus in 1966, home to management, business, leisure, hospitality, tourism and food students. In 1950 Cardiff Teacher Training College opened at Heath Park. Llandaff Technical College opened in 1954 at Western Avenue, home to health sciences, design and engineering students. In 1962 the college moved to Cyncoed, now home to the Schools of Education and Sport. ===Merging of the colleges=== In 1976, the four colleges merged to form South Glamorgan Institute of Higher Education. The name changed to Cardiff Institute of Higher Education in 1990, in preparation for Incorporation. In 1992, the Institute joined the University of Wales as an autonomous body. The first Teaching Degree Awarding Powers were granted by the Privy Council in 1993. The Institute was given the power to award its own degrees in August but placed the powers in abeyance, choosing instead to strengthen their links with the University of Wales. In 1996, it was granted University College status within the University of Wales and named the University of Wales Institute, Cardiff (UWIC). In 2003, UWIC became a constituent institution of the University of Wales.and considered merging with the University of Glamorgan. 2004 saw the launch of the FE2HE-UWIC Consortium: an FE/HE partnership established with Barry, Bridgend, Coleg Glan Hafren and Ystrad Mynach FE colleges, with St David's College joining in 2009. Tony Chapman becomes Senior Vice-Chancellor and Chief Executive of the University of Wales In 2005 the university enters into and then ends merger talks with the University of Wales, Newport. A vote of no confidence is passed by the staff in the Vice Chancellor Tony Chapman. London School of Commerce became an Associate College in 2006. The former Colchester Avenue campus in 2010 In October 2010, the new building for the Cardiff School of Management opened in Llandaff with the closure of the Colchester Avenue campus. In June 2011, the new Learning Centre on the Llandaff campus was officially opened. Merger talks with Swansea Metropolitan and Trinity St David universities were discussed. ===Split from University of Wales=== UWIC formally ended its association with the University of Wales, and was renamed Cardiff Metropolitan University in November 2011. The university now awards all of its degrees in its own name. Despite this 'withdrawal' from the University of Wales, the new Cardiff Metropolitan University retains close formal links with it. Until summer 2012 they shared the same Pro Vice Chancellor of Research. Cardiff Metropolitan University briefly continued to supply its staff for the University of Wales to use as moderators for their overseas franchised degrees. From 2004 to 2007, Cardiff Metropolitan University's Vice Chancellor, Tony Chapman, was the Senior Vice- Chancellor and Chief Executive of the University of Wales, whilst also holding the post of Vice Chancellor at UWIC. ===Pressure to merge with other HE institutions=== In December 2003, UWIC withdrew from merger talks with the University of Glamorgan, stating that it was not in the 'best interests of UWIC and the students'. In December 2004, UWIC announced merger talks with University of Wales, Newport, but withdrew from merger talks in July 2005 when the Higher Education Funding Council for Wales stated they indicated that any proposed merger must also include the University of Glamorgan.UWIC withdraws from merger talks with Newport University On 4 July 2011, UWIC pulled out of merger talks with both Swansea Metropolitan University and the University of Wales Trinity Saint David, for a new University of Wales citing the fact that it was 'dissatisfied with a lack of attention to good governance, due process and administration (in the University of Wales)'. This was despite the fact that its own Pro-Vice Chancellor for Research, Professor Robert Brown, was also one of the most senior figures in the University of Wales, serving as a member of the University of Wales Council. In December 2011 the newly established Cardiff Metropolitan University rejected the plans of the Higher Education Funding Council for Wales for the future structure of Wales' universities which proposed merging it with the universities of Glamorgan and Newport to form the UK's largest higher education institution. Pressure on Cardiff Met to merge continued to mount throughout 2011 and 2012, however, in line with Leighton Andrews' controversial Higher Education agenda. This included a plan to create a new super-university of 45,000 students in the Welsh Valleys, involving the University of Glamorgan, the University of Wales, Newport, and Cardiff Metropolitan. Newport had already agreed to merger plans put forward by Glamorgan, although it was described as a 'bilateral arrangement' with neither institution technically taking precedence. This merger plan left open the possibility of a third university becoming involved, which was recognised as a reference to Cardiff Met's position. Cardiff Metropolitan continued to oppose a merger with its neighbours, citing the lack of a business case, concerns that the new institution (which would be the largest campus university in Britain) would simply be too big to manage properly. In response to their efforts, Leighton Andrews (a strong supporter of the mergers on any terms) threatened to forcibly dissolve Cardiff Metropolitan and hand its assets over to the University formed by Glamorgan and Newport's merger. , more time had been granted to consider a three-way merger, but Cardiff Metropolitan still demanded more evidence before committing to further talks. Cardiff Metropolitan has described the existing plans as high cost and high risk, and have threatened to refer the matter to spending watchdogs, including the Auditor General. However, Cardiff Metropolitan stressed that it retained an 'open mind' on the subject of a merger, and has ruled out moving to the private sector. On 6 November 2012, the threat of dissolution was removed when the Education Minister made a statement to the Senedd that he had taken the decision to cancel the previous consultation on the proposed dissolutions because of a request from the chairs of the University of Glamorgan and the University of Wales, Newport. ==Campus== Cardiff Met's Llandaff campus Since 2007, £50 million has been invested in estate developments. In May 2009 the £5million Food Industry Centre – Zero2Five at the Llandaff Campus opened. Cardiff Met's £20 million Cardiff School of Management building officially opened in October 2010 at the Llandaff site. Student facilities, learning centres and the provisions within have also been updated. The Cyncoed campus opened the campus centre in October 2009, which houses the Students' Union, bar and cafe for student, staff and visitor use. UWIC's Student Centre at Cyncoed The Student I-Zone opened in October 2010, to provide information to students from one location. The UWIC Foundation has been set up to develop, promote and encourage improvements to the quality of teaching and research at the university. It is funded through charitable donations. In 2012 the University commenced the building of a major new development for its School of Art & Design.

It opened in 1995 as a replacement to the still standing St. Georges Bridge, which carries U.S. Route 13 over the community of St. Georges and the canal. The St. Georges Bridge is in turn a replacement for a former lift bridge that sat in the middle of town. That bridge—built in 1923—was knocked down on January 10, 1939, by the 6,000-ton freighter Waukegan. The freighter lost control, hit the north tower of the bridge, and caused it to collapse. Two people died: the bridge tender and the bridge electrician. One other bridge spanned the C & D Canal before the lift bridge. It was a small pedestrian swing bridge that crossed over the former Saint Georges Locks. It was destroyed when the locks were dismantled during the first widening and deepening (to sea level) of the canal. Bloomfield, the W. Casperson House, Linden Hill, Ethel S.

The seasonal fresh catch of \\"wet\\" fish were initially returned to Europe to be densely salted and air-dried for preservation until later use, but drying fish in Newfoundland outports allowed each boat to bring back a more valuable cargo of already dried fish from each voyage. The westbound Atlantic crossing carried an expanded crew including a shore party. While the normal crew fished from boats, the shore party felled trees to construct a small wharf or fishing stage and platforms of brush and small boughs upon which the fish would be dried about three feet above the ground. The boats returned to the fishing stage where they threw their catch to be gutted and split by the shore party, who then lightly salted the split fish and arranged them to dry on the platforms. The drying fish were covered with sailcloth every night and during fog or rainy weather, and rearranged periodically for several weeks until they hardened and could be stacked like boards. The dried fish were then stored in sheds until the expanded crew and cargo were loaded for the eastbound Atlantic crossing.Morison, Samuel Eliot \\"The European Discovery of America\\" Oxford University Press, New York (1971) pp.ix,225,235,270,272&473-477 During the fishing and drying season, members of the shore party were able to increase their profits for the voyage by trading with First Nations residents bringing furs to the outport. As Grand Banks fishing increased, the best outport locations might be secured for future use if part of the shore party would volunteer to winter-over in the outport and keep the fishing stage, drying platforms, storage sheds, and small boats in good repair. Surviving a winter in the outport was easier for men who found friendly Mi'kmaq to teach them to find and preserve the local berries to prevent scurvy. Some outport caretakers returned to Europe after wintering over, while others \\"went native\\" and remained in NewfoundlandMorison, Samuel Eliot \\"The European Discovery of America\\" Oxford University Press, New York (1971) pp.473-477 Jacques Cartier was offered furs by indigenous residents of Chaleur Bay in 1534, indicating previous experience with European fur traders;Brasser, T.J. \\"Early Indian-European Contacts\\" from \\"Handbook of North American Indians\\" (volume 15) Smithsonian Institution (1978) p.80 and Cartier found members of the Montagnais First Nation engaged in fishing for a French Captain Thiennot. On his return voyage in 1536, Cartier left one of his larger ships' boats at Renewse Harbor, Newfoundland, indicating the outport was already in use as a used boat exchange for fishing vessels needing boats for inshore fishing, but not wanting to transport them across the Atlantic.Morison, Samuel Eliot \\"The European Discovery of America\\" Oxford University Press, New York (1971) pp.228-231,378&418-423 Both the First Nations and Europeans considered these outport communities temporary facilities of the fish trade. European populated outports initially depended upon the good will of the local First Nation; and historians often consider the outports as First Nations settlements until well after colonization authorized by European monarchs. The pattern of small isolated settlements was reinforced by actions of the Parliament of England to make permanent settlement of Newfoundland illegal. Seventeenth century English fishermen and fish merchants wished to avoid competition from a local population gaining control of the most productive fishing locations as the New England colonies had done in the Gulf of Maine. The questionable legal status of Newfoundland's clandestine settlements discouraged the type of infrastructure investments found in the Maritime Provinces.Whiteley, George Northern Seas, Hardy Sailors W. W. Norton & Company 1982 p. 30 On the island of Newfoundland, residents of the capital city of St. John's are frequently referred to as townies, whereas those not from St. John's are referred to as baymen or bay wops, that is from around the bay. This usage originates from the time before reliable land transportation on the island, when most travel was by boat and settlements were located on the coast.Dictionary of Newfoundland English The railway construction in the 1890s resulted in the creation of inland communities that relied on land-based natural resources. The outports began to see wholesale depopulation following cutbacks to ferry services and construction of roads throughout the island during and after the Second World War. Following Confederation in 1949, the government of premier Joey Smallwood pursued a policy of forced/encouraged resettlement of residents from outports to central inland communities where provision of schools, health care and other government services could be achieved more cheaply. The resettlement program had many critics, as they noted that it resulted in what was likened to a \\"cultural genocide\\" as rural Newfoundland society became decimated. The cod moratorium of 1992 was another blow to the outport communities, whose entire economies were based on the ocean and its resources. Throughout the 1990s and into the 2000s, outports have voluntarily agreed to depopulate as government required 100% agreement among residents for resettlement, prior to agreeing to close a community. In March 2013, Newfoundland & Labrador Finance Minister Jerome Kennedy announced that households agreeing to resettle from some isolated communities will be given lump-sum payments of up to CAD $270,000.http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/newfoundland- labrador/story/2013/03/26/nl-resettlement-fund-isolated-communities-326.html Only a small proportion of the provincial population remains in outports along the coasts of Newfoundland and Labrador. With no highway access, limited economic growth due to declines in the fishery, and ongoing depopulation as young people move to larger urban centres, the outport is an endangered phenomenon. A 1969 CBC radio documentary by Canadian pianist Glenn Gould called The Latecomers profiled Newfoundland outports. ==See also== *Fishing stage *Heritage Foundation of Newfoundland and Labrador *List of communities in Newfoundland and Labrador ==Notes== ==External links== * Fisheries Heritage * Outport * Category:Types of populated places ","title":"Newfoundland outport"},{"id":"1283771","text":"E20 highway on the bridge (looking east) The New Little Belt Bridge () is a suspension bridge that crosses the Little Belt strait between Jutland (Jylland) and the island of Funen (Fyn) in Denmark.

He oversaw major advances in its teaching and research profile and the merger with the former Henley Management College to form Henley Business School. His period of office was also characterised by significant investment in University facilities, including the Minghella Building for the performing arts, the replacement of many of the University's halls of residence, and a new building for the Henley Business School. During his term of office, there was some controversy over the closure, on economic grounds, of the departments of Physics and Health and Social Care. Between 2007 and 2011 he was also Chairman of the Higher Education Statistics Agency, and from 2013 to 2017 was Chair of the UK Data Service/Digital Information Strategic Advisory Committee. Previous to this, Marshall was the chief executive of the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC), from 2000 to 2002. The increasing impact of the ESRC's work, and the regard in which it was held, became apparent at this time. Described as a team player who led quietly but with focus, it is no surprise that Marshall later insisted that any success under his direction was a collective effort and attributable to all staff at the Council. However, under his leadership the ESRC achieved the highest proportionate increase in its income, and earned the highest increase of all the research councils in two successive spending reviews. This saw the budget rise from under £70 million to over £110 million; a growth of nearly one third of total income.SSRC/ESRC the first forty years – researched by Analiza Gaber and Ivor Gaber and edited by Selina Fox. Like his predecessor Ron Amman, Marshall was a distinguished social science researcher, before being appointed to the ESRC. Prior appointments included a professorship in sociology at the University of Bath, lecturership and senior lecturership at the University of Essex, Morris Ginsberg Fellowship at the London School of Economics and Political Science, and Postdoctoral Research Fellowship at Nuffield College, Oxford. He has also been a visiting professor at several European universities. == Research == Marshall has made important contributions to interdisciplinary and cross-national comparative work in the social sciences. His main fields of research include social exclusion, equality of opportunity, distributive justice and the culture of economic enterprise, and he has written widely on these topics. He played an instrumental role in the Government Review of social classifications, both as a consultant and as a member of the steering group to the study, which was run jointly by the ESRC and the Office for National Statistics and which resulted in major changes to official classifications. Marshall's early research was focused on Max Weber and the origins of modern economies. His first book, based on his doctoral thesis, concerned Calvinism and the development of capitalism in seventeenth-century Scotland. In later publications he addressed the complexities of social mobility and social class which were central to the concerns of the so-called ‘Nuffield School’ of sociology. In his co-authored volume, Against the Odds? Social Class and Social Justice in Industrial Societies, published in 1997, Marshall and his colleagues took a cautious and nuanced view of the relationship between social class, social mobility and social justice through educational opportunities. Their research was rooted, in Nuffield style, in a range of social survey empirical data. His single- authored volume Repositioning Class: Social Inequality in Industrial Societies, also published in 1997, brought together a number of his essays from the previous decade, in which he argues that public pronouncements about the death of social class were greatly exaggerated. As Marshall wrote in the preface to this volume, “Social class is as important to the understanding of late twentieth-century industrial societies as it was to their early capitalist counterparts and class analysis is probably now in a healthier state than at any previous time in its long sociological history”. Marshall’s main contribution to Nuffield sociology was his connection of concepts of social justice with social mobility. He argued persuasively that political intervention is required to prevent class inequalities from impeding the advance of social justice. During the 1990s Marshall also played an important part in the creation of the department of sociology at Oxford University, in the teeth of some stiff resistance, especially from among the political scientists who wanted to subsume the subject under their discipline. == Awards and honours == He was an Official Fellow of Nuffield College at the University of Oxford from 1993 until 1999. Elected a Fellow of the British Academy in 2000 and of the Royal Norwegian Society of Sciences and Letters in 2001 and awarded a CBE in 2003 for his services to economic and social science. Marshall has been awarded honorary degrees by the Universities of Aberdeen, Exeter, Reading and Stirling. ==References== Category:1952 births Category:Living people Category:British sociologists Category:Vice-Chancellors of the University of Reading Category:Fellows of Nuffield College, Oxford Category:Fellows of the British Academy Category:Commanders of the Order of the British Empire Category:Academics of the University of Bath Category:Academics of the University of Essex Category:British chief executives Category:People educated at Falkirk High School Category:Alumni of the University of Stirling ","title":"Gordon Marshall (sociologist)"},{"id":"1283806","text":"Epirote Islands are those northern Ionian islands that are in proximity to the Epirus mainland. These include: *Kerkyra (Κέρκυρα) usually known as Corfu in English *Paxi (Παξοί) (includes Antipaxos) also known as Paxos in English *Lefkada (Λευκάδα) also known as Lefkas in English *Ithaki (Ιθάκη) usually known as Ithaca (the island of Odysseus) in English ==Legend== The Ionian Islands According to legend, the Epirote Islands were ruled by the descendants of Neoptolemus (or Pyrrhus), who came there, defeating the native Molossoi, after the events of the Trojan War. The island of Ithaki was also the legendary home of Odysseus, though he was exiled by Neoptolemus after the slaughter of Penelope's suitors in the Odyssey. ==History== At the outbreak of the Peloponnesian War in 431 BCE most of the islands, notably Kerkyra, took the side of Athens but Lefkada took the side of Sparta. In the 4th century BCE under another king Neoptolemos of the same dynasty, Molossoi (or Molossians) became more urbanized inhabiting also the area of contemporary Zagoria, where significant archeological findings (kept in the Ioannina archeological museum) were excavated in the villages of Elafotopos and Vitsa by the Vikos gorge. Still herding the western highlands of the Pindos in Zagoria, Molossoi were in constant friction over grazing, with Macedonians on the other side of the range. When, by the Treaty of Paris of November 5, 1815, the Ionian Islands became a protectorate of the United Kingdom, Corfu became the seat of the British high commissioner. The British commissioners, who were practically autocrats in spite of the retention of the native senate and assembly, introduced a strict method of government which brought about a decided improvement in the material prosperity of the islands, but by its very strictness displeased the natives. In 1864 it was, with the other Ionian Islands, ceded to the kingdom of Greece, in accordance with the wishes of the inhabitants. ==The islands today== Today all the islands are part of the Greek region of Ionian Islands. Kerkyra has a population of 97,000, Lefkada 21,000, Ithaki 3,000 and Paxi 2,000. In recent decades the islands have lost population through emigration and the decline of their traditional industries, fishing and marginal agriculture. Today their major industry is tourism. Kerkyra in particular, with its magnificent harbour, splendid scenery and wealth of picturesque ruins and castles, is a favourite stopping place for cruise liners. British tourists in particular are attracted through having read Gerald Durrell's evocative book My Family and Other Animals (1956), which describes his childhood on Kerkyra in the 1930s. ==External links== *Greek government tourist website on the Ionian Islands *Lonely Planet's Guide to the Ionian Islands *Ionian islands guide Category:Islands of Greece Epirot Islands ","title":"Epirot Islands"},{"id":"1283824","text":"CPSC may refer to: * U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission, a government agency * Caloric Porous Structure Cell, a ceramic heat cell * Colombo Plan Staff College, an inter-governmental organization in Asia Pacific for Technical and Vocational Education and Training ","title":"CPSC"},{"id":"1283825","text":"Mackie is an American professional audio products brand. Founded in Seattle in 1988 by Greg Mackie as a manufacturer of affordable and versatile compact pro audio mixers, Mackie is the primary product line of LOUD Technologies. ==History== Mackie Designs, Inc. was founded in Woodinville, Washington by Greg Mackie, an ex-Boeing worker who began making pro audio gear and guitar amps in his spare time. After founding the small line mixer manufacturer TAPCO, and later the home audio processor manufacturer AudioControl, Mackie founded Mackie Designs, Inc., designing and manufacturing affordable and versatile compact pro audio mixers under the Mackie brand in his three bedroom condominium in Edmonds, Washington. Mackie's first product was the LM-1602 line mixer, priced at $399. Mackie Micro Series 1202 mixer Following the moderate sales success of the LM-1602, the company moved to a true factory in 1991 to produce and release its follow-up model, the CR-1604. With the flexibility to be used as either a desktop or rackmount mixer (a new concept at the time) combined with solid performance and competitive price, the CR-1604 was purchased for use in a wide variety of markets and applications. The CR-1604 became a tremendous success, selling hundreds of thousands of units by 1996 and accounting for over 48% of Mackie's overall revenues at that time. During this time, Mackie remained squarely in the mixer category, introducing 8-Bus mixing consoles for multitrack recording and live sound production in 1993. Mackie took advantage of the Seattle area's plentiful electronic and engineering subcontractors and utilized automated assembly machines to achieve high productivity and quality with lower overall production costs.\\"The Making Of Mackie Mixers\\", Sound On Sound, Oct 1994 At the time, the company was growing more than 100 percent annually, forcing Mackie to relocate and expand manufacturing every year, and by 1994 Mackie had grown into a 30,000 square-foot factory to accommodate over 250 employees and US$35.5 million in annual revenues. In 1995 Mackie celebrated the milestone of having sold its 100,000th mixer and moved into a 90,000 square-foot factory.

In Finland he is best known for the design of the Lasipalatsi (\\"Glass Palace\\") and Palace Hotel, both in Helsinki. Internationally, Revell is best known for designing the New City Hall of Toronto, Ontario, Canada. New City Hall of Toronto (1966). ==Life and career== Revell, originally spelt Rewell, was born in Vaasa in 1910, and graduated from Vaasan Lyseo in 1928. He graduated as an architect from the Helsinki University of Technology in 1937. He made his architectural breakthrough already the year he graduated when he, together with fellow students Heimo Riihimäki and Niilo Kokko, won the architectural competition for the design of the Lasipalatsi, which had originally been intended as a temporary building comprising shops, restaurant and cinema, but which became one of the landmarks of Finnish \\"white functionalist\\" architecture. His next major work was the so- called Teollisuuskeskus (Industrial Centre), comprising offices, hotel (Palace Hotel), roof-terrace restaurant and ground-floor shops, situated on Helsinki's south harbour seafront. The building was also based on a competition winning proposal, made together with architect Keijo Petäjä, and was completed in 1952 in time for the Helsinki Olympic Games. Revell's international breakthrough came with winning the 1956–58 architectural competition for the design of the Toronto City Hall, which he designed together with fellow Finnish architects Heikki Castrén, Bengt Lundsten, and Seppo Valjus. The building was completed in 1965, the year following Revell's premature death. Revell married Maire Myntti in 1941; they had three daughters born in 1942, 1943 and 1945. He served as naval artillery officer in World War II, and he was one of the survivors of the sinking of the Finnish Navy flagship, the coastal defence ship Ilmarinen in 1941. In 1943, at a time when post-war reconstruction was already an important topic of discussion, Revell, along with Alvar Aalto, Aarne Ervi and Kaj Englund, was one of the instigators of the Finnish Building Information File (in Finnish: rakennustietokortisto), the Finnish version of a building standards file, to assist in standardization of building practices and component sizes.Karl-Erik Michelsen, 'The Finnish Building Information File', in Pekka Korvenmaa (ed), The Work of Architects, Rakennustieto, Helsinki, 1992. The work was financed by the Finnish Association of Architects, under the name of the Standardization Institute. As part of the research the group had contacts with a similar organisation in Germany, run by architect Ernst Neufert. In June 1943, while the war was still going on, Aalto, Ervi and Revell, together with architects Jussi Paatela and Esko Suhonen, travelled to Germany at the invitation of Neufert to witness the German building standardization efforts, including the construction of government buildings designed by Albert Speer for the Nazi government.Sarjakoski, Helena: Rationalismi ja runollisuus: Aulis Blomstedt ja suhteiden taide.

Thundereggs are rough spheres, most about the size of a baseball—though they can range from a little more than a centimeter to over a meter across. They usually contain centres of chalcedony which may have been fractured followed by deposition of agate, jasper or opal, either uniquely or in combination. Also frequently encountered are quartz and gypsum crystals, as well as various other mineral growths and inclusions. Thundereggs usually look like ordinary rocks on the outside, but slicing them in half and polishing them may reveal intricate patterns and colours. A characteristic feature of thundereggs is that (like other agates) the individual beds they come from can vary in appearance, though they can maintain a certain specific identity within them. Thunderegg is not synonymous with either geode or agate. A geode is a simple term for a rock with a hollow in it, often with crystal formation/growth. A thunderegg on the other hand is a specific geological structure. A thunderegg may be referred to as a geode if it has a hollow in it, but not all geodes are thundereggs because there are many different ways for a hollow to form. Similarly, a thunderegg is just one of the forms that agate can assume. ==Occurrence== Thundereggs are found globally where conditions are optimal. In the US, Oregon is one of the most famous thunderegg locations. Germany is also an important center for thunderegg agates (especially sites like St Egidien and Gehlberg). Other places known for thundereggs include Ethiopia, Poland, Romania, Turkey, Mexico, Argentina, Canada, Mount Hay and Tamborine Mountain, (Australia) and the Esterel massif, (France). ==Formation== Thundereggs are found in flows of rhyolite lava. They form in the lava from the action of water percolating through the porous rock carrying silica in solution. The deposits lined and filled the cavity, first with a darker matrix material, then an inner core of agate or chalcedony. The various colors come from differences in the minerals found in the soil and rock that the water has moved through.Thunderegg Oregon State Rock, StateSymbols USA ==State rock designation== On March 30, 1965, the thunderegg was designated as the Oregon state rock by a joint resolution of the Oregon Legislative Assembly.Chapter 186 — State Emblems; State Boundary 2017 Oregon Revised Statutes While thundereggs can be collected all over Oregon, the largest deposits are found in Crook, Jefferson, Malheur, Wasco and Wheeler counties. The world's largest thunderegg, a 1.75 ton specimen, is housed by the Rice Northwest Museum of Rocks and Minerals in Oregon. ==Legend== Native American legend reportedly considers the rocks to be the eggs of the thunderbirds which occupied Mount Hood and Mount Jefferson.

Santa Ana College plays host to Middle College High School, a small alternative high school in the Santa Ana Unified School District in which students can earn their Associate of Arts degree at the same time as their high school diploma. In the late 1970s the college purchased the properties on Martha Lane south of the original campus and that land is now part of the parking lot. Recent years have witnessed the further development of and annexation of adjacent property to the original location. For a short time, the college was known as Rancho Santiago College, but the name changed back to Santa Ana College in the late 1990s. In 1985, a satellite campus, what is now called Santiago Canyon College was established in Orange, California. Santiago Canyon has since grown in size to become a separate college from Santa Ana College (although both colleges are part of the Rancho Santiago Community College District). ==Academics== Various programs lead to the awarding of Associate's degrees in Arts and Sciences, as well as vocational certificates. Santa Ana College is also home to the Tessmann Planetarium which was renovated and now has a state-of-the art planetarium system. Tessmann Planetarium is the largest, both in diameter (30 ft) and seating capacity planetarium in the County of Orange CA. It was completed and became operational in 1967. Santa Ana College is also home to Around and About Orange County News (AAOC) and Noticiero Latino del Condado de Orange (NLCO) are student produced weekly news shows that have produced hundreds of professionals that work in the TV Broadcast, Film and Radio Industry. NLCO became the first Spanish language college newscast produced by a community college. The TV Department takes advantage of the Digital Media Center (DMC) which was opened a few years ago. They use the DMC to produce, shoot and edit the College's Newscast. ==Athletics== Santa Ana College sponsors 18 sports programs. The 9 men's sports programs are baseball, basketball, cross country, football, soccer, swimming, track and field, water polo and wrestling. The 9 women's programs are basketball, beach volleyball, cross country, soccer, softball, swimming, track and field, volleyball and water polo. ==Notable alumni== * Duane Allen, NFL player * Barry Asher, Hall of Fame bowler * Heath Bell, MLB All-Star Pitcher for the Miami Marlins * Bob Boyd, Basketball coach * Lem Burnham, NFL player * George Brancato, NFL player and CFL All-star * Al Carmichael, NFL player * Ed Caruthers, high jump olympian * Nancy Fuller, host of Food Network's Farmhouse Rules * Robert David Hall, Actor on the television series CSI: Crime Scene Investigation.

He was first advertised in the Malibu Sun free promotional magazine in May of 1992. His official Image Comics debut was in the second issue of Rob Liefeld's Youngblood series. Originally, the name ShadowHawk was to be used for the Marvel character Starhawk while he had darkness powers, but Tom DeFalco convinced Valentino to use the name for a new character instead. ==Paul Johnstone== ===Fictional character biography=== Paul Johnstone grew up as a troubled youth in Harlem, New York City. He avoided a life of crime due in part to the encouragement of a man named Richard Woodroe, who was originally assigned as a caseworker to Paul when he was caught stealing, and eventually married his mother, becoming his stepfather. Eventually, Paul became a lawyer and, beyond that, a district attorney. While his life was going so well, his half brother Hojo had taken his success in college, moved to Wall Street and developed a Coke and crack addiction. Using Hojo, some gangsters tried to leverage Paul into letting their men off, but Paul refused. Soon after he ended up the target of an assault intended to serve as an example to others who got in the way of these mobsters. This incident culminated in his attackers injecting him with HIV-infected blood. After the encounter, Johnstone was left uncertain regarding whether he had been infected or not. The attack had been made public and word of his possible infection spread through Johnstone's workplace, making it a very inhospitable environment to be in. Tensions between Johnstone and one of his co-workers led to an altercation between the two which landed Johnstone out of a job and in jail. After he was released, Paul received medical confirmation that he was HIV positive and he descended into depression. While walking the streets to clear his head, Paul was threatened by a group of young gang members. He went berserk and attacked them, leading to his brutal mugging and return to the hospital. During this time he resolved that he would use the rest of his time to dispense justice to the individuals who preyed on innocent victims. One of his friends, a cop named Christina Reid (who had been kicked off the force that day for use of excessive force), was also in the hospital and came to visit him. She informed Paul that she and a man named Carlton Sun had been developing an exoskeleton suit of armor that could help aid him in accomplishing this task. Johnstone decided to don the suit, christening himself \\"ShadowHawk\\" after his favorite superhero (a name that would eventually lure out the psychotic and racist villain Hawk's Shadow, who believed he was the one entitled to bear the mantle of ShadowHawk), and was taught how to fight effectively with the help of Christine, promising to \\"take back the night.\\" Johnstone also kept the pills needed to slow his reaction to his HIV infection in small pouches on his belt so he could take them as needed. Early on, ShadowHawk's actions against criminals were brutal. He would catch violent criminals in the act and break their spines, leaving them to be discovered by police with no indication that he had attacked them other than hearsay from the criminals. This led to ShadowHawk garnering a reputation as an urban legend as well as being hunted by both criminals and law enforcement alike. Johnstone would also face various supervillains, including crime-boss Vendetta, her gang the Regulators (Blackjack, Vort-X, Arson, Hardedge and Scandal), the acidic mutant Liquifier, super-powered hitman Dedline and the racist Shadowhawk copycat Hawk's Shadow. Shadowhawk also encounters other superheroes such as Spawn and The Savage Dragon. Shadowhawk would later become a member of the superhero group Brigade. Later in his career (and as his lifespan shortened due to the progression of HIV to AIDS), Johnstone eventually grew to be less violent. He encounters Trencher and his dispatcher Phoebe; who agrees to assist him in his search for a cure to his infection or another way to extend his life. This led to encounters with the likes of Shadowhawk #13 Youngblood's Chapel (another hero also infected with HIV), Bloodstrike and Shadowhawk team-up with each other in the hopes of finding a cure, he then teams up with the WildC.A.T.s. (who offered a possible solution involving a robotic body to transplant Johnstone's consciousness into - which would ultimately fail to work), Shadowhawk then visited the Others in a similar attempt, where they attempt to exorcise the spirit of the virus from his body, which ultimately fails, he is then transported into an encounter with Supreme (in which a battle would ensue, leading to the discovery of ShadowHawk's true identity to the world), he then encounters Badrock and company in another attempt at changing his body's structure in order to live longer, again leaving in failure, and finally meeting Spawn in his alleyways who, with the help of Trencher and Phoebe, convince him to accept his inevitable death from the virus. One of his few regrets was that he never got to join a super-group, as in his search for a cure, he had realized how useful and fun fighting in a group was. In his final act as ShadowHawk, Johnstone would rescue his mother from being attacked by Hawk's Shadow. The aftermath of the fight would leave Johnstone in a weakened state and unable to elude the pursuit of the police. He was remanded into custody and transported to a hospital where AIDS eventually took its toll and ended his life. ==The New ShadowHawk== In the wake of Paul Johnstone's death, it was revealed that ShadowHawk is in fact a \\"Spirit of Justice\\" and the spirit has inhabited at least four people in the past. Three of the revealed ShadowHawks were human, the last one being a robot. The three human Shadowhawks dealt with villains such as big game huntress Trophy, the toxic mutant Glortch, the mutant crime- boss Joe the Blowfish and the street gang of super-villains the Junkyard Dogz (Hotspur, Rumble Doll, Fast Lucy, Guncrazy and Needle). One of the Shadowhawks included Paul Johnstone's accomplice, Christina Reid. Like Johnstone, the New Shadowhawks become members of Brigade.The New ShadowHawk #1 (June 1995) - #7 (March 1996). After the Spirit of Justice leaves the robot it becomes \\"Justice\\", without human feelings and starts to kill people. The saga of the robot ShadowHawk was told in a crossover story called \\"ShadowHunt,\\" which ran through five Image titles in April 1996.Chapel v.II #7, Youngblood v.2 #7, Team Youngblood #22 At the end of New Man #4, the robot was destroyed. ===Edward Collins=== ===Fictional character biography=== After the robot is destroyed, Eddie Collins, a young high school student, makes his debut as the new ShadowHawk. Having just moved to New York with his recently widowed father James, an electrician, Eddie was walking down a street when the helmet literally fell into his hands. The helmet - called \\"Nommo\\" - contains the spirits of all people who were, at one time, inhabited by ShadowHawk, the Spirit of Justice. Eddie Collins tried to meditate with the Nommo on, meeting the spirit of Paul Johnstone, who tells Eddie that he is a reincarnation of a first dynasty Egyptian shaman, how he was the prior ShadowHawk and that Eddie is destined to start anew. At first Eddie's father orders him to stop, thinking it would kill him. But Eddie is faster, stronger and more agile now and finds new responsibility to the people of New York City. After saving some hostages, Eddie meets Captain Nieves and starts working with him.Shadowhawk One-Shot #1: \\"Great Responsibility\\" (July 2006) ===Jim Valentino's ShadowHawk=== Blacklight, a 1960s \\"Hippie Hero\\" wakes up from a 30-year coma and learns his wife Dayglo was killed 10 years ago by a villain called Firepower. He is falsely told by a mysterious man that Shadowhawk is the son of Firepower. Blacklight later attacks Shadowhawk and is accidentally killed by him.Jim Valentino's ShadowHawk #1: Shadows and Light After killing Blacklight, ShadowHawk faces a mercenary named ZAP.Jim Valentino's ShadowHawk #2: Zapped After ZAP is defeated, police propose that Eddie Collins go through the Police Academy to learn the difference between superhero and vigilante. Eddie is attacked by the man who hired ZAP and lied to Blacklight, named Nocturn. Out on patrol, Nocturn, who knows Eddie Collins is ShadowHawk, attacks him. After a brutal fight, Hawk's Shadow comes out of the shadows to face his \\"returned\\" arch-enemy.Jim Valentino's ShadowHawk #3: \\"Here Comes the Night\\" After being beaten nearly to death, Shadowhawk faces Hawk's Shadow, who wants the helmet that gives Shadowhawk his powers. In the end, Paul Johnstone usurps Eddie's body and beats Hawk's Shadow to near death, but Eddie stops him before the kill.Jim Valentino's ShadowHawk #4: \\"Back in the Shadows Again\\" Soon, Eddie meets the new Blacklight, who is investigating the origin of her new-found powers. The two team-up to bring a vicious monster down. Their target turns out to be the first Blacklight.Jim Valentino's ShadowHawk #5 to 6: Dead Man Walking/Suffer Not a Corpse to Live Eddie's mentally unstable classmate, Philip Marko discovers he has the power of Pyrokinesis. After killing ten people at the high school and his mother, ShadowHawk stops him.Jim Valentino's ShadowHawk #7 to 8: My World on fire A man-beast named Komodo kills Eddie's best friend, Steven \\"Skeeve\\" Evans and defeats Shadowhawk. The helmet, the source of ShadowHawk's power, is taken by Hawk's Shadow, who steps in and kills Komodo. He is soon confronted by his father, the Silver Age ShadowHawk. With the help of the new Blacklight, and Astroman, Eddie goes after Hatfield (Hawk's Shadow) and wins, taking back the helmet.Jim Valentino's ShadowHawk #9 to 12: Rising After hearing the stories of past Shadowhawks, Eddie Collins makes the decision that now he is going to be ShadowHawk on his terms and receives a new costume.Jim Valentino's ShadowHawk #13: Past Lives Steven Evans' younger brother blames Shadowhawk for his brothers death and seeks revenge, while Hawk's Shadow's brain is placed in Komodo's body.Jim Valentino's ShadowHawk #14 to 15: On the rebound ==Silver Age ShadowHawk== The Silver Age ShadowHawk is a parody of the Jack Schiff-era Batman comics.ShadowHawks of the Past He works out of the Shadowcave which is in the basement of his house, has a Shadowcar and a Shadowdog. His wife and son are his crimefighting partners, Lady ShadowHawkette and Squirrel. Squirrel went on to become Hawk's Shadow (see above). The Shadowhawk Special featured two Silver Age ShadowHawk stories. In \\"The Hyena's Revenge\\" ShadowHawk and Squirrel hunt the Hyena, a villain based on the Joker. The second was \\"The Phantom Gorillas from Dimension-Z!\\" The Silver Age ShadowHawk also appeared with the Silver Age Knight Watchman in Big Bang Comics #2. The story \\"Rising\\" in issue 11 of Jim Valentino's ShadowHawk described Hatfield Sr and his family's final fight against the Hyena and the death of Lady ShadowHawkette. ==Shadowhawk: Resurrection== Image Comics announced a new Shadowhawk ongoing series following the events of Image United. The series featured Paul Johnstone, the original Shadowhawk, as wearing the helmet once again 15 years after his death.http://www.comicvine.com/shadowhawk-1-resurrection-part- one/4000-212618/ The story was written by Dan Wickline, and the art by Tone Rodriguez and Jim Valentino. The series also featured covers by Erik Larsen and Frank Bravo. Variant covers for ShadowHawk: Resurrection took homage from older issues of ShadowHawk titles and other notable covers throughout comic history. Notably, ShadowHawk: Resurrection Issue 3 featured a variant that was styled after the glow-in-the-dark cover for ShadowHawk (1st Series) issue 3,http://www.comicvine.com/shadowhawk-3-resurrection-part-three/4000-226216/ while issue 5 featured a variant cover that paid homage to the \\"Death of Supergirl\\" cover of \\"Crisis on Infinite Earths\\" issue #7.http://www.comicvine.com/shadowhawk-5-resurrection-part-five/4000-247375/ ==Toys== Two action figures of Shadowhawk have been released in the past by McFarlane Toys.

It consists of three line segments called sides or edges and three points called angles or vertices. Just as in the Euclidean case, three points of a hyperbolic space of an arbitrary dimension always lie on the same plane. Hence planar hyperbolic triangles also describe triangles possible in any higher dimension of hyperbolic spaces. An order-7 triangular tiling has equilateral triangles with 2π/7 radian internal angles. ==Definition== A hyperbolic triangle consists of three non-collinear points and the three segments between them., interactive instructional website ==Properties== Hyperbolic triangles have some properties that are analogous to those of triangles in Euclidean geometry: *Each hyperbolic triangle has an inscribed circle but not every hyperbolic triangle has a circumscribed circle (see below). Its vertices can lie on a horocycle or hypercycle. Hyperbolic triangles have some properties that are analogous to those of triangles in spherical or elliptic geometry: *Two triangles with the same angle sum are equal in area. *There is an upper bound for the area of triangles. *There is an upper bound for radius of the inscribed circle. *Two triangles are congruent if and only if they correspond under a finite product of line reflections. *Two triangles with corresponding angles equal are congruent (i.e., all similar triangles are congruent). Hyperbolic triangles have some properties that are the opposite of the properties of triangles in spherical or elliptic geometry: *The angle sum of a triangle is less than 180°. *The area of a triangle is proportional to the deficit of its angle sum from 180°. Hyperbolic triangles also have some properties that are not found in other geometries: *Some hyperbolic triangles have no circumscribed circle, this is the case when at least one of its vertices is an ideal point or when all of its vertices lie on a horocycle or on a one sided hypercycle. *Hyperbolic triangles are thin, there is a maximum distance δ from a point on an edge to one of the other two edges. This principle gave rise to δ-hyperbolic space. ==Triangles with ideal vertices== Three ideal triangles in the Poincaré disk model The definition of a triangle can be generalized, permitting vertices on the ideal boundary of the plane while keeping the sides within the plane. If a pair of sides is limiting parallel (i.e. the distance between them approaches zero as they tend to the ideal point, but they do not intersect), then they end at an ideal vertex represented as an omega point. Such a pair of sides may also be said to form an angle of zero. A triangle with a zero angle is impossible in Euclidean geometry for straight sides lying on distinct lines. However, such zero angles are possible with tangent circles. A triangle with one ideal vertex is called an omega triangle. Special Triangles with ideal vertices are: ===Triangle of parallelism=== A triangle where one vertex is an ideal point, one angle is right: the third angle is the angle of parallelism for the length of the side between the right and the third angle. ===Schweikart triangle=== The triangle where two vertices are ideal points and the remaining angle is right, one of the first hyperbolic triangles (1818) described by Ferdinand Karl Schweikart. ===Ideal triangle=== The triangle where all vertices are ideal points, an ideal triangle is the largest possible triangle in hyperbolic geometry because of the zero sum of the angles. ==Standardized Gaussian curvature== The relations among the angles and sides are analogous to those of spherical trigonometry; the length scale for both spherical geometry and hyperbolic geometry can for example be defined as the length of a side of an equilateral triangle with fixed angles. The length scale is most convenient if the lengths are measured in terms of the absolute length (a special unit of length analogous to a relations between distances in spherical geometry). This choice for this length scale makes formulas simpler. In terms of the Poincaré half-plane model absolute length corresponds to the infinitesimal metric ds=\\\\frac{dz}{\\\\operatorname{Im}(z)} and in the Poincaré disk model to ds=\\\\frac{2dz}{1-z^2}. In terms of the (constant and negative) Gaussian curvature of a hyperbolic plane, a unit of absolute length corresponds to a length of :R=\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{-K}}. In a hyperbolic triangle the sum of the angles A, B, C (respectively opposite to the side with the corresponding letter) is strictly less than a straight angle. The difference between the measure of a straight angle and the sum of the measures of a triangle's angles is called the defect of the triangle. The area of a hyperbolic triangle is equal to its defect multiplied by the square of : :(\\\\pi-A-B-C) R^2{}{}\\\\\\\\!. This theorem, first proven by Johann Heinrich Lambert, is related to Girard's theorem in spherical geometry. ==Trigonometry== In all the formulas stated below the sides , , and must be measured in absolute length, a unit so that the Gaussian curvature of the plane is −1. In other words, the quantity in the paragraph above is supposed to be equal to 1. Trigonometric formulas for hyperbolic triangles depend on the hyperbolic functions sinh, cosh, and tanh. ===Trigonometry of right triangles=== If C is a right angle then: *The sine of angle A is the hyperbolic sine of the side opposite the angle divided by the hyperbolic sine of the hypotenuse. ::\\\\sin A=\\\\frac{\\\\textrm{sinh(opposite)}}{\\\\textrm{sinh(hypotenuse)}}=\\\\frac{\\\\sinh a}{\\\\,\\\\sinh c\\\\,}.\\\\, *The cosine of angle A is the hyperbolic tangent of the adjacent leg divided by the hyperbolic tangent of the hypotenuse. ::\\\\cos A=\\\\frac{\\\\textrm{tanh(adjacent)}}{\\\\textrm{tanh(hypotenuse)}}=\\\\frac{\\\\tanh b}{\\\\,\\\\tanh c\\\\,}.\\\\, *The tangent of angle A is the hyperbolic tangent of the opposite leg divided by the hyperbolic sine of the adjacent leg. ::\\\\tan A=\\\\frac{\\\\textrm{tanh(opposite)}}{\\\\textrm{sinh(adjacent)}} = \\\\frac{\\\\tanh a}{\\\\,\\\\sinh b\\\\,}. *The hyperbolic cosine of the adjacent leg to angle A is the cosine of angle B divided by the sine of angle A. ::\\\\textrm{cosh(adjacent)}= \\\\frac{\\\\cos B}{\\\\sin A}. *The hyperbolic cosine of the hypotenuse is the product of the hyperbolic cosines of the legs. ::\\\\textrm{cosh(hypotenuse)}= \\\\textrm{cosh(adjacent)} \\\\textrm{cosh(opposite)}. *The hyperbolic cosine of the hypotenuse is also the product of the cosines of the angles divided by the product of their sines. ::\\\\textrm{cosh(hypotenuse)}= \\\\frac{\\\\cos A \\\\cos B}{\\\\sin A\\\\sin B} = \\\\cot A \\\\cot B ====Relations between angles==== We also have the following equations: : \\\\cos A = \\\\cosh a \\\\sin B : \\\\sin A = \\\\frac{\\\\cos B}{\\\\cosh b} : \\\\tan A = \\\\frac{\\\\cot B}{\\\\cosh c} : \\\\cos B = \\\\cosh b \\\\sin A : \\\\cosh c = \\\\cot A \\\\cot B ====Area==== The area of a right angled triangle is: :\\\\textrm{Area} = \\\\frac{\\\\pi}{2} - \\\\angle A - \\\\angle B also :\\\\textrm{Area}= 2 \\\\arctan (\\\\tanh (\\\\frac{a}{2})\\\\tanh (\\\\frac{b}{2}) ) ====Angle of parallelism==== The instance of an omega triangle with a right angle provides the configuration to examine the angle of parallelism in the triangle. In this case angle B = 0, a = c = \\\\infty and \\\\textrm{tanh}(\\\\infty )= 1, resulting in \\\\cos A= \\\\textrm{tanh(adjacent)}. ====Equilateral triangle==== The trigonometry formulas of right triangles also give the relations between the sides s and the angles A of an equilateral triangle (a triangle where all sides have the same length and all angles are equal). The relations are: :\\\\cos A= \\\\frac{\\\\textrm{tanh}\\\\frac12 s }{\\\\textrm{tanh} (s)} :\\\\cosh \\\\frac12 s= \\\\frac{\\\\cos(\\\\frac12 A)}{\\\\sin( A)}= \\\\frac{1}{2 \\\\sin(\\\\frac12 A)} ===General trigonometry=== Whether C is a right angle or not, the following relationships hold: The hyperbolic law of cosines is as follows: :\\\\cosh c=\\\\cosh a\\\\cosh b-\\\\sinh a\\\\sinh b \\\\cos C, Its dual theorem is :\\\\cos C= -\\\\cos A\\\\cos B+\\\\sin A\\\\sin B \\\\cosh c, There is also a law of sines: :\\\\frac{\\\\sin A}{\\\\sinh a} = \\\\frac{\\\\sin B}{\\\\sinh b} = \\\\frac{\\\\sin C}{\\\\sinh c}, and a four-parts formula: :\\\\cos C\\\\cosh a=\\\\sinh a\\\\coth b-\\\\sin C\\\\cot B which is derived in the same way as the analogue formula in spherical trigonometry. ==See also== *Pair of pants (mathematics) *Triangle group For hyperbolic trigonometry: *Hyperbolic law of cosines *Hyperbolic law of sines *Lambert quadrilateral *Saccheri quadrilateral ==References== ==Further reading== *Svetlana Katok (1992) Fuchsian Groups, University of Chicago Press Triangle Category:Triangles ","title":"Hyperbolic triangle"},{"id":"1283871","text":"Magnetic field lines around a Maxwell coil Modulus of the magnetic field around a Maxwell coil A Maxwell coil is a device for producing a large volume of almost constant (or constant-gradient) magnetic field. It is named in honour of the Scottish physicist James Clerk Maxwell. A Maxwell coil is an improvement of a Helmholtz coil: in operation it provides an even more uniform magnetic field (than a Helmholtz coil), but at the expense of more material and complexity. ==Description== right A constant-field Maxwell coil set consists of three coils oriented on the surface of a virtual sphere. According to Maxwell's original 1873 design: each of the outer coils should be of radius \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{4}{7}}R , and distance \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{3}{7}}R from the plane of the central coil of radius R. Maxwell specified the number of windings as 64 for the central coil and 49 for the outer coils. Though Maxwell did not specifically state that current for the coils came from the same source, his work was specifically describing the construction of a sensitive galvanometer designed to detect a single current source. It follows that the ampere-turns for each of the smaller coils must be exactly \\\\frac{49}{64} of the turns of the larger. ==Gradient-field Maxwell coil== A gradient-field Maxwell coil is essentially the same geometry of the 3-coil configuration above, with the central coil removed to leave only the smaller two coils.R.

Accessed on line December 12, 2007. Dougherty was the Democratic nominee for Maryland's 6th congressional district in 2008. ==Early life and education== Dougherty graduated from Georgetown Visitation Preparatory School in Washington, D.C. She later graduated from Mount Saint Mary's University in 1983 with a BA in History, magna cum laude. While a student at The Mount, Dougherty was a 4-year varsity field hockey player. She is the only person in The Mount's Athletic Hall of Fame honored for field hockey. Dougherty also wrote for The Mountain Echo, The Mount's official campus-wide newspaper, for 4 years, serving as editor-in-chief in her senior year. ==Career== Dougherty operated Jennifer's Restaurant on West Patrick Street (opened 1987; closed 2008) and Dougherty's Irish Shop (1999–2006). She also served on the Board of Directors of Heartly House, the Frederick County Chamber of Commerce President (1999), and Rotary Club of Carroll Creek. More recently in December 2009, Dougherty and partner Bruce Rhoderick opened Magoo's Pub and Eatery on West Second Street in Frederick.http://www.fredericknewspost.com/sections/business/display.htm?StoryID=99508 ==Mayor of Frederick== Dougherty's tenure in Frederick's City Hall was marked by accomplishments and challenges. The focus on improving the relationship with the Frederick Police Department by hiring Chief of Police, Kim C. Dine, strengthened the community support for the police. Her tenure was marked with inciting divisiveness among her fellow politicians. A strong proponent of unions, she fought hard behind the scenes to get city workers to unionize. The workers finally voted against this initiative, and the labor support of Dougherty waned. The creation of the Neighborhood Advisory Councils to better serve each neighborhood established a more effective communication link for the residents. Many saw her Neighborhood Advisory Committees (NACs) as a way to pander to select, influential neighborhood members who then fostered votes on her behalf. The city had resisted speed bumps for years, at the request of fire and rescue professionals. Speed bumps became commonplace in neighborhoods where there were NACs supportive to Dougherty. During her tenure, the city faced serious water shortages due to decades of growth and poor management of water and sewer infrastructure. Innovative legislation created a process to track and allocate water to new development in the city. A million-dollar temporary, mobile water treatment plant was installed that never was able to produce potable water. The water produced created plumbing problems for surrounding neighborhoods. The long-stalled Carroll Creek Linear Park was finally completed with the investment of public effort and investment. With the completion of the public improvements, the city sought private investment of more than $100 million in the first phase bringing needed tax revenue to the city. The Dougherty Administration also addressed aging infrastructure by creating an incentive for mall owners to improve their properties. The Golden Mile Tax Credit District resulted in more than $50 million in private investment and 1000 new jobs. Dougherty was diversified in her hiring, placing more women in high positions. After a failed re-election bid Dougherty went to work for the mother of one of her previous subordinates in real estate. ==Congressional campaign== On November 19, 2007, Dougherty filed to run for Maryland's 6th congressional district. She won the primary and was the Democratic candidate for congress in 2008 against 8-term Republican Roscoe Bartlett. Bartlett defeated Dougherty in the general election. ==Subsequent mayoral campaigns== Dougherty announced in 2009 that she would again seek the office of mayor of the City of Frederick, but lost in the primary to newcomer Jason Judd. Dougherty has remained visible in Frederick politics and has recently filed a bid for the 2017 mayoral election. In 2013, Jennifer Dougherty announced that she was running for mayor of Frederick as an independent candidate. The election was held on November 5. Dougherty lost, garnering 19.43 percent of the vote to Democratic nominee Karen Young's 31.59 percent and incumbent Republican Mayor Randy McClement's 48.75 percent. ==Electoral History== ! bgcolor=#cccccc Year ! bgcolor=#cccccc Office ! bgcolor=#cccccc Election ! ! bgcolor=#cccccc Winner ! bgcolor=#cccccc Party ! bgcolor=#cccccc Votes ! bgcolor=#cccccc % ! ! bgcolor=#cccccc Opponent ! bgcolor=#cccccc Party ! bgcolor=#cccccc Votes ! bgcolor=#cccccc % ! ! bgcolor=#cccccc Opponent ! bgcolor=#cccccc Party ! bgcolor=#cccccc Votes ! bgcolor=#cccccc % -  2008  Congress, 6th district  General   bgcolor=#FFE8E8 Roscoe Bartlett  bgcolor=#FFE8E8 Republican  bgcolor=#FFE8E8 176,062  bgcolor=#FFE8E8 58.18   bgcolor=#DDEEFF Jennifer Dougherty  bgcolor=#DDEEFF Democratic  bgcolor=#DDEEFF 116,455  bgcolor=#DDEEFF 38.48   bgcolor=#9DFF9D Gary Hoover  bgcolor=#9DFF9D Libertarian  bgcolor=#9DFF9D 10,101  bgcolor=#9DFF9D 3.34 -  2009  Mayor of Frederick, Maryland  Primary   bgcolor=#FFE8E8 Jason Judd  bgcolor=#FFE8E8 Democratic  bgcolor=#FFE8E8 1,672  bgcolor=#FFE8E8 58.65   bgcolor=#DDEEFF Jennifer Dougherty  bgcolor=#DDEEFF Democratic  bgcolor=#DDEEFF 1003  bgcolor=#DDEEFF 35.18   bgcolor=#9DFF9D Chris Simpson  bgcolor=#9DFF9D Democratic  bgcolor=#9DFF9D 176  bgcolor=#9DFF9D 6.17 -  2013  Mayor of Frederick, Maryland  General   bgcolor=#FFE8E8 Randy McClement  bgcolor=#FFE8E8 Republican  bgcolor=#FFE8E8 3,714  bgcolor=#FFE8E8 48.75   bgcolor=#DDEEFF Karen Young  bgcolor=#DDEEFF Democratic  bgcolor=#DDEEFF 2,407  bgcolor=#DDEEFF 31.59   bgcolor=#9DFF9D Jennifer Dougherty  bgcolor=#9DFF9D Unaffiliated  bgcolor=#9DFF9D 1,480  bgcolor=#9DFF9D 19.43 ==References== ==External links== *2008 campaign site Category:1961 births Category:Living people Category:Georgetown Visitation Preparatory School alumni Category:Politicians from Alexandria, Virginia Category:Women mayors of places in Maryland Category:Mount St. Mary's University alumni Category:Women in Maryland politics Category:Mayors of Frederick, Maryland Category:Maryland Democrats Category:Candidates in the 2008 United States elections Category:21st-century American politicians Category:21st-century American women politicians ","title":"Jennifer Dougherty"},{"id":"1283876","text":"Jacob Tonson, sometimes referred to as Jacob Tonson the Elder (1655–1736), was an eighteenth-century English bookseller and publisher. Tonson published editions of John Dryden and John Milton, and is best known for having obtained a copyright on the plays of William Shakespeare by buying up the rights of the heirs of the publisher of the Fourth Folio after the Statute of Anne went into effect. He was also the founder of the famous Kit-Cat Club. His nephew, Jacob Tonson the Younger (1682–1735), was his business partner. The business was continued by the younger Tonson's son, Jacob Tonson (1714–1767). ==History== Scholars have not always been sure of Tonson's birthdate, and it has in the past been listed as occurring in 1655 or 1656. But the register of christenings in the parish of St Andrew Holborn demonstrates that Tonson was born on 12 November 1655 and baptized 18 November 1655. The register lists Tonson as the \\"sonne of Jacob Tonson Shoemaker and of Elizabeth his wife neare Grayes Inn Lane.\\" He is believed to have been related to Major Richard Tonson, who obtained a grant of land in county Cork from Charles II, and whose descendants became Barons Riversdale. His father's will left him and his elder brother Richard, as well as three sisters, each £100, to be paid when they came of age. On 5 June 1670 Jacob was apprenticed to Thomas Basset, a stationer, for eight years. Having been admitted a freeman of the Company of Stationers on 20 December 1677, he began business on his own account, following his brother Richard, who had commenced in 1676, and had published, among other things, Thomas Otway's Don Carlos. Richard Tonson had a shop within Gray's Inn Gate; Jacob Tonson's shop was for many years at the Judge's Head in Chancery Lane, near Fleet Street. It has been said that when Tonson bought the copy of Troilus and Cressida (1679), the first play of John Dryden's that he published, he was obliged to borrow the purchase money (£20) from Abel Swalle, another bookseller. The names of both booksellers appear on the title-page, as was often the case at that time. Tonson was sufficiently well off to purchase plays by Otway and Nahum Tate. In 1681 the brothers Richard and Jacob joined in publishing Dryden's Spanish Friar, and in 1683 Jacob obtained a valuable property by purchasing from Barbazon Ailmer, the assignee of Samuel Simmons, one half of his right in Paradise Lost. The other half was purchased at an advance in 1690. Tonson afterwards said he had made more by Paradise Lost than by any other poem. In the earlier part of his life Tonson was much associated with Dryden. A step which did much to establish his position was the publication in 1684 of a volume of Miscellany Poems, under Dryden's editorship. Other volumes followed in 1685, 1693, 1694, 1703, and 1708, and the collection, which was several times reprinted, is known as both as Dryden's Miscellany and Tonson's Miscellany. During the ensuing year Tonson continued to bring out pieces by Dryden, and on 6 October 1691 paid thirty guineas for all the author's rights in the printing of the tragedy of Cleomenes. Joseph Addison's Poem to his Majesty was published by Tonson in 1695, and there was some correspondence respecting a proposed joint translation of Herodotus by Boyle, Richard Blackmore, Addison, and others. Dryden's translation of Virgil, executed between 1693 and 1696, was published by Tonson in July 1697 by subscription. Serious financial differences arose between the poet and his publisher, and Dryden's letters to Tonson (1695–1697) are full of complaints of meanness and sharp practice and of refusals to accept clipped or bad money. Tonson would pay nothing for notes; Dryden retorted, \\"The notes and prefaces shall be short, because you shall get the more by saving paper.\\" He added that all the trade were sharpers, Tonson not more than others. Dryden described Tonson thus, in lines written under his portrait, and afterwards printed in Faction Displayed (1705): :With leering looks, bull-faced, and freckled fair; :With two left legs, and Judas-coloured hair, :And frowzy pores, that taint the ambient air. Subsequently the letters became more friendly, and on the publication of Alexander's Feast, in late 1697, Dryden wrote to Tonson, \\"I hope it has done you service, and will do more.\\" Dryden's collection of translations from Boccaccio, Chaucer, and others, known as The Fables, was published by Tonson in November 1699; a second edition did not appear until 1713. There is an undated letter from Mrs. Aphra Behn to Tonson at Bayfordbury, thanking him warmly for what he had said on her behalf to Dryden. She begged hard for five pounds more than Tonson offered for some of her verses. In connection with Jeremy Collier's attack on the stage, the Middlesex justices presented the playhouses in May 1698, and also William Congreve for writing the Double Dealer, Thomas d'Urfey for Don Quixote, and Tonson and Brisco, booksellers, for printing them. Tonson published Congreve's reply to Collier, and at a later date The Faithful Friend and The Confederacy by his friend, Sir John Vanbrugh. Jacob Tonson took into partnership his nephew (pictured), also named Jacob Tonson and sometimes referred to as Tonson Junior. Before the end of the century Tonson had moved from the Judge's Head to a shop in Gray's Inn Gate, probably the one previously occupied by his brother Richard. It is not unlikely that Richard was dead, and that Jacob, who had no children, and seemingly never married, now took into partnership his nephew Jacob, whose son was afterwards to be his heir. It is not always easy to distinguish the uncle from the nephew in later years; the latter is sometimes referred to as Tonson Junior. By 1700 Tonson's position was well established, and about that time the Kit-Cat Club was founded, with Tonson as secretary. The meetings were first held at a mutton- pie shop in Shire Lane, kept by Christopher Cat, and may have begun with suppers given by Tonson to his literary friends. About 1703 Tonson purchased a house at Barn Elms, and built a room there for the club. In a poem on the club, attributed to Sir Richard Blackmore, we find: :One night in seven at this convenient seat :Indulgent Bocaj [Jacob] did the Muses treat. Tonson was satirised in several skits, and it was falsely alleged that he had been expelled by the club, or had withdrawn from the society in scorn of being their jest any longer. In 1703 Tonson went to the Dutch Republic to obtain paper and engravings for the fine edition of Caesar's Commentaries, which was ultimately published under Samuel Clarke's care in 1712. At Amsterdam and Rotterdam he met Addison, and assisted in some abortive negotiations for Addison's employment as travelling companion to Lord Hertford, son of the Duke of Somerset. In 1705 Tonson published Addison's Remarks on several Parts of Italy. Verses by young Alexander Pope were circulating among the critics in 1705, and in April 1706 Tonson wrote to Pope proposing to publish a pastoral poem of his. Pope's pastorals ultimately appeared in Tonson's sixth Miscellany (May 1709). William Wycherley wrote that Tonson had long been gentleman-usher to the Muses: \\"you will make Jacob's ladder raise you to immortality.\\" Nicholas Rowe's edition of Shakespeare, in six volumes, was published early in 1709 by Tonson, who had previously advertised for materials. Richard Steele dined at Tonson's in 1708–1709, sometimes to get a bill discounted, sometimes to hear manuscripts read and advise upon them. There is a tradition that in earlier days Steele had had a daughter by a daughter of Tonson's; if this is true, it must apparently have been a daughter of Richard Tonson, Jacob's brother. In the autumn of 1710 Tonson moved to the Shakespeare's Head, opposite Catherine Street in the Strand; his former shop at Gray's Inn Gate was announced for sale in the Tatler for 14 October (No. 237); and it seems to have been taken by Thomas Osborne, stationer, the father of the afterwards well-known publisher, Thomas Osborne (died 1767). On 26 July 1711, after a long interval, Swift met Addison and Steele \\"at young Jacob Tonson's\\". \\"The two Jacobs\\", says Jonathan Swift to Esther Johnson, \\"think it I who have made the secretary take from them the printing of the Gazette, which they are going to lose.... Jacob came to me t'other day to make his court; but I told him it was too late, and that it was not my doing.\\" Accounts furnished to Steele by Tonson of the sale of the collective editions of the Tatler and Spectator have been preserved; from October 1712 Tonson's name was joined with Samuel Buckley's as publisher of the Spectator. In November 1712 Addison and Steele sold all their right and title in one half of the copies of the first seven volumes of the Spectator to Tonson the younger, for £575, and all rights in the other half for a similar sum to Buckley. Buckley in October 1714 reassigned his half-share in the Spectator to Tonson junior for £500. Tonson published Addison's tragedy, Cato, in April 1713; and, according to a concocted letter of Pope's, the true reason why Steele brought the Guardian to an end in October was a quarrel with Tonson, its publisher; \\"he stood engaged to his bookseller in articles of penalty for all the Guardians, and by desisting two days, and altering the title of the paper to that of the Englishman, was quit of the obligation, those papers being printed by Buckley.\\" There are various reasons why this story is improbable; the truth seems to be that Steele was anxious to write on politics with a freer hand than was practicable in the Guardian. In the summer of 1714 we hear of Steele writing political pamphlets at Tonson's, where there were three bottles of wine of Steele's, and in October Tonson printed Steele's Ladies' Library. Tonson appears in Rowe's Dialogue between Tonson and Congreve, in imitation of Horace: :Thou, Jacob Tonson, were, to my conceiving, :The cheerfullest, best, honest fellow living. In the same year Tonson, with Barnaby Bernard Lintot and William Taylor, was appointed one of the printers of the parliamentary votes. Next year he paid fifty guineas for the copyright of Addison's comedy, The Drummer, and published Thomas Tickell's translation of the first book of the Iliad, which gave offence to Pope. On 6 February 1718 Lintot entered into a partnership agreement with Tonson for the purchase of plays during eighteen months following that date. The title page of a 1727 English translation of Plutarch's Parallel Lives, published by Tonson The title page of volume 2 of Thornhagh Gurdon's A History of the High Court of Parliament (1st ed., 1731),. which was printed for \\"J. Tonson at Shakespear's Head in the Strand\\" In one of several amusing letters from Vanbrugh, now at Bayfordbury, Tonson, who was then in Paris, was congratulated upon his luck in South Sea stock, and there is other evidence that he made a large sum in connection with Law's Mississippi scheme. \\"He has got £40,000\\" wrote Robert Arbuthnot; \\"riches will make people forget their trade.\\" In January 1720 Tonson obtained a grant to himself and his nephew of the office of stationer, bookseller, and printer to some of the principal public offices; and on 12 October 1722 he assigned the whole benefit of the grant to his nephew. The grant was afterwards renewed by Robert Walpole, in 1733, for a second term of forty years. The elder Tonson seems to have given up business about 1720. He had bought the Hazells estate at Ledbury, Herefordshire, and in 1721 he was sending presents of cider to the Dukes of Grafton and Newcastle, the latter of whom called Tonson \\"my dear old friend,\\" and asked him to give him his company in Sussex. Henceforth we may suppose, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, that \\"Tonson\\" in contemporary allusions means the nephew. Steele's Conscious Lovers appeared in 1722, and Tonson assigned to Lintot halt the copyright for £70. He had to apply to the court of chancery for an injunction to stop Robert Tooke and others printing a pirated edition of the play; the sum paid for the copyright was £40. In the same year Tonson published the Duke of Buckingham's Works, and in 1725 Pope's edition of Shakespeare. Proposals were issued by Tonson in January 1729 for completing the subscription to the new edition of Rymer's Fœdera, in seventeen folio volumes (of which fifteen were then printed), at fifty guineas the set. The work was finished in 1735. Tonson published a quarto edition of Waller's works, edited by Fenton, in 1729, and an edition of Lord Lansdowne's works in 1732. Pope was annoyed to find in 1731 that Tonson was to be one of the publishers of Lewis Theobald's proposed edition of Shakespeare, in which he feared an attack on his own editorial work, but he professed to be satisfied with the assurances he received. In writing to the elder Tonson on this subject, Pope asked for any available information respecting the \\"Man of Ross,\\" and, in thanking him for the particulars received, explained his intention in singling out this man as the centre of a poem. Earlier in the year the elder Tonson was in town, and Pope, writing to Lord Oxford, said that if he would come to see him he would show him a phenomenon worth seeing, \\"old Jacob Tonson, who is the perfect image and likeness of Bayle's Dictionary; so full of matter, secret history, and wit and spirit, at almost fourscore.\\" On 19 March Lord Oxford, Lord Bathurst, Pope, and Gay dined with old Tonson at Barnes and drank Swift's health. In 1734 Samuel Gibbons was appointed stationer to the Prince of Wales in place of Jacob Tonson. Jacob Tonson junior predeceased his uncle, dying on 25 November 1735, worth £100,000. His will, of great length, was written on 16 August and proved on 6 December 1735. The elder Tonson's death at Ledbury followed that of his nephew on 17 March 1735/6. The elder Tonson's will was made on 2 December 1735 and proven in probate on 2 April 1736, when he was described as worth £40,000. A painting of the elder Tonson by Godfrey Kneller is among the Kit-Cat portraits; it is best known through Faber's engraving. Pope says that Tonson obtained portraits from Kneller without payment by flattering him and sending him presents of venison and wine. Dryden's satirical account of his appearance has been quoted; Pope, in The Dunciad calls him \\"left-legged Jacob\\" and \\"genial Jacob\\". John Dunton describes Tonson as \\"a very good judge of persons and authors; and as there is nobody more competently qualified to give their opinion of another, so there is none who does it with a more severe exactness or with less partiality; for, to do Mr. Tonson justice, he speaks his mind upon all occasions, and will flatter nobody.\\" No doubt this roughness of manner wore off as Tonson grew in prosperity. == Jacob Tonson the younger == Jacob Tonson (died 1767) (Jacob Tonson the younger) was the great-nephew of the Jacob Tonson the elder and son of Jacob Tonson junior. He carried on the publishing business in the Strand. In 1747 he paid Warburton £500 for editing Shakespeare, and he was eulogised by Steevens [sic] in the advertisement prefixed to his edition of Shakespeare 1778: \\"he never learned to consider the author as an under-agent to the bookseller . . . His manners were soft and his conversation delicate,\\" but he reserved his acquaintance for a small number. Samuel Johnson spoke of him as \\"the late amiable Mr. Tonson.\\" In 1750 he was High Sheriff of Surrey, and in 1759 he paid the fine for being excused serving the same office for the city of London and county of Middlesex. There is a story of his having twice helped Henry Fielding when that writer was unable to pay his taxes. Tonson died on 31 March 1767, without issue, in a house on the north side of the Strand, near Catherine Street, whither he had removed the business some years earlier. His will was made in 1763. In 1775 letters of administration of the goods of Jacob Tonson, left unadministered by Richard Tonson, were granted to William Baker, esq. (M.P. for Hertfordshire), and in 1823, Baker having failed to administer, letters of administration were granted to Joseph Rogers. ==Richard Tonson== Richard Tonson (died 1772), the third Jacob Tonson's brother, who took little part in the concerns of the business, lived at Water Oakley, near Windsor, where he built a room for the Kit-Cat portraits. His benevolence and hospitality made him popular, and in 1747 he was elected MP for Wallingford, and in 1768 MP for New Windsor. In some correspondence with the Duke of Newcastle in 1767, the duke spoke of his old friendship with Richard Tonson, \\"the heir of one I honoured and loved, and have passed many most agreeable hours with.\\" Richard Tonson died on 9 October 1772. Besides the papers at Bayfordbury, there is a considerable collection of Tonson papers in the British Museum, some relating to business and some to private matters; but many of them are damaged or fragmentary. ==References== ;Attribution * *. ==External links== *Raymond N.

Chapman University offers 110 areas of study (49 majors and 61 minors), and encompasses ten schools and colleges on campus, including Fowler School of Engineering, Dodge College of Film and Media Arts, Fowler School of Law, and Schmid College of Science and Technology. It is classified among \\"R2: Doctoral Universities – High research activity\\". ==History== Sculpture of Charles C. Chapman, founder and namesake of Chapman University, created by sculptor Raymond Persinger Wilkinson Hall Schmid Gate, built in 2005 A section of the Berlin Wall is featured in Liberty Plaza. Founded as Hesperian College, in Woodland, California, the school began classes on March 4, 1861. Its opening was timed to coincide with the hour of Abraham Lincoln's first inauguration. Hesperian admitted students regardless of sex or race. In 1920, the assets of Hesperian College were absorbed by California Christian College, which held classes in downtown Los Angeles. In 1934, the school was renamed Chapman College, after the chairman of its board of trustees (and primary benefactor), C. C. Chapman. In 1954, Chapman College moved to its present campus in the city of Orange on the site formerly occupied by Orange High School, which relocated to a nearby campus. Chapman established a Residence Education Center Program to serve military personnel in 1958. This evolved into Brandman University. Chapman College became Chapman University in 1991. In that year, Dr. James L. Doti became president of Chapman University. ==Colleges and programs== Dale E. Fowler School of Law ===Argyros School of Business and Economics=== The George L. Argyros School of Business and Economics is a private research and academic institution at Chapman University located in the Arnold and Mable Beckman Business and Technology Hall. Founded in 1977, the school is named after George L. Argyros, a Chapman alum and former U.S. Ambassador to Spain. Argyros has chaired the board of trustees of Chapman University since 1976, and has donated significant resources towards establishing Chapman as a leading national business school. The business school was renamed in Argyros' honor in 1999. In 2019 the Argyros School celebrated the 20th Anniversary of the naming of the school, capped off with a special fundraiser dinner on October 9, featuring special guest President George W. Bush. The event raised approximately $15 million for the school's endowment, $10 million of which was a surprise announcement by the Argyros family. The $15 million raised is believed to be the largest 1-day fundraising event in Orange County's history. The Argyros School offers undergraduate and graduate degrees in business. The MBA program has three lines, Executive (EMBA), Flexible, and Full-time. In 2018 Chapman's Full-time program was ranked #73 by Bloomberg/Businessweek. Building on its strength in undergraduate accounting, the school also offers a one-year Master of Science in Accounting degree. In 2008, The Princeton Review ranked Chapman Business School's undergraduate and graduate programs among its Top 25 programs in the country. The Argyros School of Business and Economics was officially nationally ranked as the 60th Best Undergraduate Bloomberg BusinessWeek Business School in 2014. In 2016, the Argyros School of Business and Economics rose to 34th in the same Bloomberg rankings. The Argyros School is home to a number of leading research centers and independent research institutes, including the A. Gary Anderson Center for Economic Research, the C.

On June 1, 2014, the Schmid College underwent a reorganization to spin off the Crean College of Health and Behavioral Sciences. Schmid College is organized into two schools: the School of Computational Sciences and the School of Earth and Environmental Sciences. The School of Computational Sciences offers programs in computer science, software engineering, mathematics, and physics, among others. The school emphasizes the teaching and use of computational modeling and analysis that can be incorporated into research conducted in fields related to the environment and health sciences. The school offers both M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in computational and data sciences. The School of Earth and Environmental Sciences has programs in the foundational sciences (chemistry, biology, etc.), and also in environmental and food science. In addition to its undergraduate and graduate programs, Schmid College is home to various centers for research. The Center of Excellence in Computation, Algebra, and Topology (CECAT), directed by Dr. Drew Moshier, Professor of Mathematics and Computer Science, provides a forum for interdisciplinary research where computation meets algebra, topology and related mathematical fields. The Center of Excellence in Complex and Hyper- complex Analysis (CECHA), directed by mathematician Dr. Mihaela Vajiac, is a research unit motivated by the latest results in Clifford and Hypercomplex Analysis and endeavors to find new ways in which this research can be applied in mathematics and physics. The Center of Excellence in Earth Systems Modeling & Observations (CEESMO), directed by physicist Dr. Menas Kafatos, is a research unit which uses data from Earth observation satellites to model, analyze, and understand the Earth systems with particular emphasis on natural hazards (e.g. wildfires, severe weather, floods, dust storms, earthquakes). CEESMO provides access to satellite data through its remote sensing and Geographic Information System (GIS) lab utilizing advanced computational tools.

Attallah Piazza and Leatherby Libraries == Controversy == During the Spring Semester of 2019, student protests over the film school's display of two The Birth of a Nation posters received national attention. The posters were part of a larger donation from Cecilia DeMille Presley, granddaughter of American filmmaker Cecil B. DeMille, and had been displayed on the first floor of Marion Knott Studios since they were gifted to the school in 2007. During the 2018–2019 school year, Chapman's black student population became more vocal about their discomfort with the display of posters for a film that has been widely criticized for its racist tones, celebration of white supremacy, and use of blackface. The film also is often credited by scholars with reviving the Ku Klux Klan. Though the film is often taught in film school due to its historical importance to the film industry (it is considered to be the first ever blockbuster), the presence of the film's posters made students feel that the film's message was actually being celebrated. After nearly a month of student protests and two years after a student first started an online petition, the Dodge College faculty voted to remove the posters and return them to the donor. ==Notable people== ===Faculty=== * Yakir Aharonov – Professor, James J.

He taught himself to read when he was 16. Rivero managed to secure a high school education by his own efforts, and obtained a law degree from Havana University (1934). Elected a city councilman in Santiago de Cuba, he quickly became a leader of the Liberal Party, and was befriended by Fulgencio Batista. During Batista's first administration (1940–1944), Rivero served as Minister of Agriculture, and implemented Batista's plan for resettling landless peasants in Oriente Province. During General Batista's exile in the United States from 1944–1952, Rivero practised law in Cuba and wrote political commentary for several periodicals. When Batista returned to run for President of Cuba in 1952, Rivero helped to organise Batista's United Action Party. He supported Batista's military coup on 10 March 1952, and thereafter served as Minister of Education in Batista's second administration (1952–1958). Elected a Senator from Pinar del Río province in 1954, Rivero became Cuba's prime minister (1957–1958), and participated in several reconciliation conferences as Batista's representative. Rivero resigned his premiership in 1958 to run for President of Cuba. He received the support of Batista's Progressive Action Party, and three other pro-government parties. Rivero was declared the winner of the elections, which were speculated by many to have been rigged with the support of the United States government in an effort to repel the ongoing Cuban revolution.Nohlen, D (2005) Elections in the Americas: A data handbook, Volume I, p217 After the election, Rivero entered into conversations with U.S. Ambassador Earl E. T. Smith, and with leading Cuban politicians, to resolve the crisis caused by the ongoing rebellion led by Fidel Castro. He apparently wished to convene a Constituent Assembly shortly after taking office, to bring about a restoration of constitutional rule. However, the success of the revolution frustrated Rivero's plans, and he fled with General Batista into exile in the Dominican Republic on 1 January 1959. Rivero eventually settled in the United States, living in extremely modest circumstances. He lived to be a great-grandfather. Rivero died in Miami, Florida in 1996. ==References== ==External links== *Despatch From the US Embassy in Cuba to the US Department of State 1958 Elections: Electoral Outlook Six Weeks Prior to Elections Category:Cuban senators Category:Prime Ministers of Cuba Category:1905 births Category:1996 deaths Category:Liberal Party of Cuba politicians Category:People from Santiago de Cuba Province Category:Cuban people of Spanish descent Category:People of the Cuban Revolution Category:1950s in Cuba Category:20th-century Cuban lawyers Category:20th-century Cuban politicians Category:Grand Crosses 1st class of the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany ","title":"Andrés Rivero Agüero"},{"id":"1283907","text":"Demona (), voiced by Marina Sirtis, is a fictional character and one of the primary antagonists of the Disney animated television series Gargoyles. Demona was once Goliath's mate and was part of their 10th century AD castle's Wyvern Clan. She is consumed by a hatred of humanity and has attempted several times to destroy it. ==Character design== In the original pitch for the series, the initial leader of the gargoyle clan was Dakota, but it was later decided she would work best as a villain and thus her name was changed to Demona. ==Character biography== Demona was a member of the Gargoyle clan at the medieval Scottish Castle Wyvern, Goliath's mate and second-in-command. Like the rest of the clan, Demona originally had no formal name, though Goliath frequently referred to her as his \\"Angel of the Night\\". The two mated and eventually had a daughter, Angela, who would join the Manhattan Clan 1000 years into the future. Resentful of human prejudice toward her clan, Demona conspired with the Captain of the Guard to betray the humans inhabiting Castle Wyvern to the Viking raiders. However, Demona failed to convince Goliath to get the gargoyles away from the castle - her end of the bargain - and the clan was slaughtered during daylight. When Goliath returned with Hudson, he was devastated to see the murder of his clan, which he believed included his mate. Demona abandoned the castle with the intent of coming back once he had calmed down, returning only to find the six survivors, including Goliath, under the Magus' stone sleep curse. This broke her heart, beginning the downward spiral in Demona's life of loneliness and pain. Alone for several years, Demona had an encounter with a child named Gillecomgain (based loosely on Gille Coemgáin of Moray), scarring his face when he catches her stealing food. Gillecomgain becomes the original Hunter, the progenitor of a millennial-long line of mercenary and assassin descendants seeking revenge against her. She is later joined by surviving Gargoyles from other clans in 997. During the year she encounters a time lost Brooklyn, who convinces her and the clan to help Kenneth III fight against Constantine. Though she agrees, she plans to retrieve the Grimorum Arcanorum after it is taken by Constantine's sorcerer Brother Valmont. After Kenneth's side has won the battle, the freed Phoenix (the former prisoner of the Phoenix Gate) is about to take the \\"timedancing\\" Brooklyn to another time period. Since Brooklyn suspects that Demona wants the Grimorum to use in taking over Scotland, Brooklyn offers to hold it while she takes out her half of The Phoenix Gate and while Brooklyn is whisked away. By 1020 A.D., Demona allies herself with a young Macbeth to kill their common enemy of Gillecomgain. In 1032 A.D, an elderly Demona enters into a bargain with Macbeth; Macbeth entered it to protect his kingdom from his cousin Duncan I of Scotland, while Demona wanted her youth back so she could lead the last of her kind. The pact is facilitated by the Weird Sisters, rendering both of them immortal, except if one kills the other, in which case both would perish. Neither of them realized that the Weird Sisters and the evil Archmage from Castle Wyvern planned to take over the mystical island of Avalon in the 20th century, with their help. Macbeth himself soon comes to admire Demona's combat prowess, and eventually becomes heavily dependent on Demona's clan for support in the war with Duncan's forces. In the final battle with Duncan in August 1040, Demona's devastating attacks so impress Macbeth, he exclaimed \\"You fight like a demon!\\" — directly inspiring him to name her \\"Demona\\" (lit. \\"She- Demon\\"), for the first time, a name she finds very pleasing, and simultaneously declares her as his primary adviser. The two become fast friends, and it appears that Demona's life may turn around for the better. Eventually, Demona's trust in Macbeth evaporates after overhearing Macbeth's courtier advising him on severing their ties with the Gargoyles in order to win the support of the English. Fearing that this would come to pass (though Macbeth strongly denies it), she abandons his forces to Duncan's son Canmore and the English armies. Canmore, in turn, betrays her, killing the last of her clan. Demona would not enter into another alliance with a human for almost a thousand years. During the intervening time, she amasses a substantial fortune, while plotting her revenge on humanity; all the while being hunted by Canmore's descendants, who take up the mask of the Hunter. One hunter attacked her in Florence in 1495. According to Greg Weisman: \\"In 1920, Demona would encounter a hunter, Fiona Canmore in Paris, France. This event would have been seen in the unfinished Team Atlantis series.\\" She encounters and kills another hunter named Charles Canmore in Paris in 1980. Some time before 1994, Demona allied herself with David Xanatos, gets him the Grimorum Arcanorum, and tells him about the spell put upon the Gargoyles at Castle Wyvern. This leads Xanatos to bringing the castle to Manhattan and waking up Goliath and the rest of the clan. Despite her and Xanatos's efforts to manipulate them, the clan refused to join her vendetta and actively opposes her. She later assisted Xanatos in resurrecting one of the dead Gargoyles from Wyvern, Coldstone, attempted to murder Elisa Maza, and also tried to exterminate humanity on numerous occasions; first by having Puck destroy them (which failed: he impishly \\"destroyed\\" the humans by turning them into gargoyles), and then used magic to turn them into stone during the night, allowing her to go on a vicious murder spree. When magic and sorcery failed, she turned to science by hiring geneticist and villain Anton Sevarius, to help create a virus that would destroy all human life on Earth. When she was invited to Xanatos and Fox's wedding as the bridesmaid, with Goliath as the best man, she attended, claiming that she needed to keep Xanatos as an ally for the time being. However, it was a plot to restore the Phoenix Gate. The four traveled back to 975 AD, where Xanatos would fulfill his own destiny while Demona showed her past self her clan frozen during the night. These events lead up to her hatred of humanity. Demona in her daytime-only human form, as \\"Dominique Destine\\" Demona is also granted a \\"gift\\" by the magical being Puck: after she requests that he make her able to walk in daylight without turning to stone, he devises and casts a spell that transforms Demona into a human at sunrise, and remains so during the day until sunset, when she transforms back into her \\"gargate\\" form. The transformation is incredibly painful and it hurts Macbeth when he is in proximity as part of their binding spell. Though initially furious at Puck's trick, she realized the positive uses of her human form as she later took up the alias of Dominique Destine. Using the immense fortune and resources that she acquired over the years, she formed a company called Nightstone Unlimited and became its CEO. She uses the company to further her goals when she cannot as a Gargoyle. She allied herself with Goliath's evil clone Thailog to first, steal Macbeth's fortune, and when failing that, creating their own version of the Manhattan Clan through cloning. Though, the ever treacherous Thailog had other plans and betrayed her, leaving her for dead after a fight with the Manhattan Clan. She was later revealed to be alive. At the end of the show's run, she was still trying to successfully execute her ultimate plan of the destruction of the human race while trying to reach out to her daughter Angela, and win her over to her cause. She is incredibly overprotective of Angela and will step in and defend her if she is attacked. Demona was last seen on Halloween in Saint Damien's Cathedral recovering the crystal ruins of the Praying Gargoyle. ==Powers and abilities== Demona possesses most of the standard superhuman attributes common to all members of her species. Demona is superhumanly strong, sufficiently so to easily crush or shatter guns in her grasp. Demona's agility, reflexes, and stamina are also much greater than those of a human. Her body is somewhat tougher and more resistant to certain kinds of injury than those of humans. She can withstand great impact forces, such as being struck with a blunt object or falling from several stories or being struck by a superhumanly strong being, that would severely injure or kill a human being. However, Demona can be injured by conventional bullets, bladed weapons, or more advanced weaponry, such as lasers, just as easily as a human can. Also, Demona's eyes glow a deep red when she is angry, unlike male gargoyles, whose eyes glow white. Demona, like all gargoyles, has a physiology distinctly different from the human species. While she is vaguely humanoid in shape, but with wings and a tail, many gargoyle bodily functions are distinctly non- human. For example, all gargoyle females lay eggs just as monotremes do. Demona possesses large, bat-like wings that she is able to use to glide on currents of air. Combined with her great strength, her claws are capable of rending most materials including stone and most types of metals. Demona also has a long, prehensile tail that she uses to help keep herself balanced while gliding or while running at high speeds. She can also use this tail as a weapon and even to wrap around objects and grip them if she chooses to. As seen in a number of episodes,For example in the episode \\"Long Way To Morning\\" where her laser gun turns to stone with her. items held by a gargoyle often will turn to stone as well, a magical effect which also affects their clothes. Due to the spell simultaneously cast upon her and Macbeth by the Weird Sisters, Demona is functionally immortal in the sense that she no longer ages and cannot die through conventional means. Their shared spell of immortality also only allows them to be killed for good if one of them kills the other, which will result in the deaths of both of them simultaneously, as they will otherwise eventually recover. Also, they can experience one another's pain (ala Corsican Brothers) if they are physically close to each other. At a later time, thanks to a spell cast by Puck, she now transforms into a human at sunrise instead of entering a normal gargoyle's period of \\"stone slumber\\", and resumes her gargoyle form at sunset, with both transformations generating a great deal of pain when they occur. Demona begins to use her daytime human guise for her own nefarious plots, now using the alias of \\"Dominique Destine\\". Demona had secretly studied with the Archmage as his apprentice and had developed an aptitude in sorcery, and due to her aforementioned immortality, she has also become quite adept at understanding and using advanced technology. Demona is also a highly formidable combatant, both armed and unarmed, with skills concerning a broad variety of weaponry ranging from swords to the most advanced firearms. She also has a general understanding of chemistry, although nowhere close to the expertise of \\"freelance geneticist\\" Anton Sevarius. From her acquired daytime existence as the human female \\"Dominique Destine\\", Demona is quite adept at manipulating the systems of modern society. Specifically, Demona's daytime human identity allows her to utilize her vast fortune without suspicion, partly helping her to acquire a lavishly appointed home with many modern comforts, made much easier with her daytime identity. Her functional immortality has helped her to gain the substantial degree of knowledge about, and experience with how modern society operates. Demona does function well enough in the modern world up to a point — for example, she knew how to hail a cab while in human form and used slang terms on a few occasions. Demona at one point possessed a number of pages torn from the Grimorum Arcanorum, the central and ancient spell book of magic in the Gargoyles series, of which the majority are presumably still in her possession. These removed pages contain spells that can be used as formidable magical weapons that Demona can bring to bear against the Manhattan Clan and humanity in general. She has thus far invoked three different spells from the Grimorum, two of which were ripped out of the book after the failure of the first. The first such spell was an attempt to turn Goliath into a slave of whoever held the spell which ensnared his mind. Originally this spell was contained within the book itself, but Brooklyn tore it from its pages in order to keep her from using Goliath any further, Elisa later using the spell to order Goliath to act for the rest of his life as though he wasn't under its influence when they couldn't find a means to break the original spell. The second spell she used was taken from the torn pages of the Grimorum, and was used during the four part \\"City of Stone\\" story arc to turn Manhattan's human population to stone during the night, although it was eventually negated when the clause was triggered and the night sky blazed bright thanks to Xanatos and the Manhattan Clan working together to disperse a combustible chemical through the air. The last spell was used in the Hunter's Moon episodes in which she intended to use a mix of sorcery and science to destroy all other intelligent life on Earth except for the Gargoyle species, by dispersing a lethal virus while using an enchanted statue to protect Gargoyles, but this plan was averted when the statue was destroyed, thus creating the possibility that gargoyles would succumb to the infection as well. Although each attempt at the use of magic to achieve her goals has been thwarted, the remaining pages she possesses, if any, means she has many other methods by which she might yet achieve her desire for the elimination of mankind. Whether or not she ever used them are unknown, as the series came to an end after the events of the third-season spin-off The Goliath Chronicles. In one of the spin-offs originally pitched by series co-creator Weisman, Demona would have eventually reformed during one of the Gargoyles spin-off ideas set in the far future. This would indicate that whatever weapons or plots she had at her disposal, they either failed, or she simply did not use them. ==In other media and merchandise== Demona is the end boss in the video game Gargoyles. ==Reception== In 2011, UGO.com included the Weird Sisters' spell bonding Demona with Macbeth on their list of the TV's most horrible curses. In 2016, Demona was #3 on MsMojo's Top 10 TV Cartoon Villainesses https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lz2AJ4fMz3o ==See also== *List of female supervillains ==References== ==External links== * Demona - Gargwiki * Demona at International Superheroes Category:Female characters in animated series Category:Fictional female businesspeople Category:Television characters introduced in 1994 Category:Fictional characters with superhuman strength Category:Fictional characters who use magic Category:Fictional mass murderers Category:Fictional characters from New York City Category:Fictional shapeshifters Category:Fictional Scottish people Category:Fictional women soldiers and warriors Category:Gargoyles (TV series) characters Category:Video game bosses Category:Animated series villains Category:Fictional characters with immortality Category:Disney animated villains Category:Female villains ","title":"Demona"},{"id":"1283921","text":"Barnabas Collins is a fictional character, a featured role in the ABC daytime serial Dark Shadows, which aired from 1966 to 1971. Barnabas is a 175-year-old vampire in search of fresh blood and his lost love, Josette. The character, originally played by Canadian actor Jonathan Frid, was introduced in an attempt to resurrect the show's flagging ratings, and was originally to have only a brief 13-week run. He was retained due to his popularity and the program's quick spike in ratings, and virtually became the star of the show. A defining feature of Barnabas' character development is his gradual but persistent transformation from a sinister, frightening creature of the night into the show's protagonist, who selflessly, heroically and repeatedly risks his life to save the Collins family from catastrophe. In the 1991 NBC revival version of Dark Shadows, British actor Ben Cross played the role of Barnabas Collins. Alec Newman played the part in the unreleased 2004 pilot film. In the recent series of audio dramas produced by Big Finish Productions, he is portrayed by Andrew Collins, while Frid returned to portray the role a final time in The Night Whispers. The role is played by Johnny Depp in director Tim Burton's 2012 film, Dark Shadows. Barnabas Collins was the main character in most of the 32 \\"Dark Shadows\\" paperback novels written by Marilyn Ross (Canadian author W.E.D. Ross) from the late 1960s to the early '70s. (Ross wrote hundreds of novels in several genres and under various pseudonyms.) TV Guide named Barnabas Collins #8 in its 2013 list of The 60 Nastiest Villains of All Time.Bretts, Bruce; Roush, Matt; (March 25, 2013). \\"Baddies to the Bone: The 60 nastiest villains of all time\\". TV Guide. pp. 14 - 15. ==Origin== Barnabas Collins was a member of the late 18th century Collins family, from the fictional town of Collinsport, Maine. He was the son of Joshua Collins (Louis Edmonds) and Naomi Collins (Joan Bennett). Barnabas' many cousins included Millicent and Daniel Collins. During the flashback, Barnabas intended to marry an heiress from Martinique named Josette du Pres (Kathryn Leigh Scott), but had a brief affair with Angelique Bouchard (Lara Parker), Josette's maidservant. Upon Angelique's arrival in Collinsport for the wedding, Barnabas was determined not to resume his affair. The spurned Angelique Bouchard, a practitioner of witchcraft, used a number of spells to manipulate Barnabas and his family and force his agreement to marry her. Barnabas discovered Angelique's duplicity, and shot her. With what she believed to be her dying words, she took revenge on Barnabas by summoning a vampire bat from hell to attack him. Barnabas fell extremely ill and died. Angelique survived and attempted to rescind the curse, but was unsuccessful. Barnabas shortly thereafter rose as a vampire, and soon strangled Angelique. Collins later frightened his aunt Abigail (Clarice Blackburn) to death, and left the hatefully fanatic witch-hunter Reverend Trask (Jerry Lacy) entombed alive in the Old House basement. Sarah Collins died of pneumonia after a cold night spent hiding in the woods from her deceased brother. Adding to Barnabas' grief, his mother Naomi committed suicide after discovering his secret. Barnabas Collins blamed Angelique for the deaths of both his sister and his mother, and also blamed Lt. Nathan Forbes (Joel Crothers), who had told Naomi about him. Barnabas strangled Forbes, and attempted to transform Josette into a vampire. Josette was willing, if not fully cognizant of what this would entail, until Angelique revealed a vision of what she would become. Fleeing from Barnabas, Josette leapt off the cliffs of Widow's Hill to her death. Unable to bear what he had become, Barnabas Collins asked his father, Joshua, to destroy him. Joshua Collins was unable to slay his son, and ordered servant Ben Stokes (Thayer David) to nail a cross to the inside lid of Barnabas' coffin and to wrap chains on its outside, forever imprisoning the vampire in a secret room of the family mausoleum at Eagle's Hill Cemetery. ==The return of Barnabas Collins== In 1967, while searching the Collins family crypt for their rumored lost jewels, Willie Loomis (John Karlen) stumbled upon the chained coffin in which Barnabas slept. Believing the coffin to contain the Collins family riches, Willie inadvertently released the vampire. Barnabas attacked Willie and turned him into his unwilling servant. Barnabas Collins introduced himself to the modern Collins family as a cousin from England, a hard-working businessman never seen during the day. The family accepted this story, despite having never before heard of him, because of his resemblance to the portrait of the ancestral Barnabas which hung in Collinwood. The thirsty Barnabas made victims of several Collinsport residents. He was particularly taken with waitress Maggie Evans (Kathryn Leigh Scott), who resembled his long-lost love, Josette. Barnabas was told by David Collins (David Henesy) that Josette's spirit still haunted the Collinwood estate, where it periodically helped and protected others, including young David. Barnabas Collins kidnapped Maggie, hypnotized her to believe that she was Josette, and planned to make her his vampire bride. Maggie escaped with help from the ghost of Sarah Collins, but the emotional distress of being kidnapped caused Maggie to regress to a childlike mentality and to forget all that had happened. Barnabas Collins then targeted David's governess, Victoria Winters (Alexandra Moltke) as a potential consort. He tried to seduce her away from her fiancé Burke Devlin (Anthony George), and then to bite her. The ghost of Sarah appeared repeatedly throughout and warned Barnabas, who was tormented by a feeling of responsibility for her death, away from evil deeds. Maggie was sent to Wyndcliff Sanitarium, where Dr. Julia Hoffman (Grayson Hall) tried to get her to remember what happened and to identify her kidnapper. Dr. Hoffman found that the answer lay somewhere at Collinwood, and discovered who and what Barnabas was. Julia fell in love with Barnabas and attempted to cure him, and hypnotized Maggie to forget everything Barnabas had tried to do to her. Barnabas Collins initially distrusted Julia, and when her medical cure failed, viewed her as a risk who would be able to expose his true nature. He attempted to kill Julia, or to drive her mad so that no one would believe her accusations. Ultimately, Barnabas came to see Julia as a useful ally. The romantic relationship Julia desired never happened on-screen, but she became Barnabas' chief confidante and helped him many times, while Barnabas Collins became genuinely devoted to Julia and would go to extraordinary lengths to protect or rescue her when she ran afoul of enemies such as Angelique (eventually a firm friend), ghosts, and the ancient Leviathans. ==Barnabas's women== Barnabas Collins's great love was his fiancée from 1795, Josette du Pres, but throughout the show he had interest in many different women, including Maggie Evans, Victoria Winters and Roxanne Drew. He wanted these women to share his vampire existence, and wanted Maggie and Victoria to assume the identity of Josette. His closest ally and friend was Dr. Julia Hoffman, who was quietly in love with him and supported his attempts to find happiness. While aware that Julia did have strong feelings for him, Barnabas' complex feelings for Julia evolved from initial fear and distrust to deep affection, devotion and protection. At one point, Barnabas Collins admitted to Willie Loomis that he cared for Julia more than he appeared to. ==Other appearances== The 1970 MGM film House of Dark Shadows centers on the release of Barnabas Collins from his coffin by Willie Loomis. Unlike Frid's television portrayal of Barnabas, the Barnabas featured in the film was truer to a typical evil vampire, who by the end of the film had killed half of the Collins family. Barnabas himself is killed by Jeff Clark, now depicted as Maggie's boyfriend, and a dying Willie Loomis, when Barnabas tries to make Maggie Evans his vampire bride. Barnabas does not appear in the sequel, Night of Dark Shadows, which focuses on another relation, Quentin Collins. In the 2012 film Dark Shadows, Barnabas is played by Johnny Depp as a somewhat-modernized version of the character from the original series. He has a deep obsession with Josette, has no forgiveness for those who betray him, and believes that his curse can be reversed. He shows deep emotions for his modern family members, whose lives he longs to be part of. He displays his television counterpart's powers and abilities, while subject to his cold vampire instincts. Barnabas tries to win the love of David's governess Maggie Evans, now called Victoria Winters, who reminds him of his lost beloved Josette. Depp's version is up to date with popular culture and has a strong taste for rock music. He wears a hair and clothing style similar to his late 1960s counterpart, but dresses more colorfully. His character is portrayed as somewhat more sexually active and eccentric than before. This incarnation has a different relationship with Dr. Hoffman, who never becomes his ally. ==Personality== Barnabas often blamed his moments of cruelty on his transformation into one of the undead or \\"nosferatu,\\" but other characters revealed that Barnabas was not always the reluctant victim that he claimed. He carried on a sexual dalliance with the obsessed Angelique despite his claim of love for Josette, which set in motion many tragedies in his life. Jealousy and wounded male pride caused him to fatally wound his uncle in a duel, after Jeremiah's elopement with Josette. He attempted to back out of his agreement to marry Angelique after she cured his sister of illness. Given proof that his newlywed bride Angelique was a witch, he attempted to murder her. A drunken Ben Stokes admitted that Barnabas, prior to his change, \\"... weren't no good then, neither — but now, he's worse!\\" When the vampire tried to silence his own father by killing him, an astonished Joshua Collins exclaimed: \\"You would kill even me! You must have always had so much hatred in you. No one could be filled with it so quickly!\\" While many of his flip-flopping infatuations with nubile young women could be attributed to his vampire curse and his need to find a vampire bride, his romantic choices during his periods as a human were equally immature and baffling. In later interviews, Jonathan Frid admitted this was all part of the character's success, \\"... the lies he told to himself.\\" However harsh or impulsive he may have been, Barnabas is nevertheless not without a conscience, either as a human or as a vampire. He is shown to be capable of feeling guilt for wrongs committed, as well as love for other people. For example, he shows a softer side for Dr. Julia Hoffman as he becomes closer to her, and once mentioned that he cared for her more than he let on. He risked his life whenever she was in grave trouble, and only when the Leviathans gave the order to have Julia killed did Barnabas have the strength to break free of their control. When Angelique tried to endanger Julia's life, an enraged Barnabas warned her that if she ever tried to harm Julia again, he would personally see to her own destruction. His confrontation with Angelique over the deaths that his curse had caused revealed that he did care deeply for his mother, his sister and for Josette. ==Powers== Barnabas' abilities mimic those of the classic vampire Dracula, and include immortality, superhuman strength, superhuman speed, hypnotism, and the abilities to transform into a bat and to disappear and reappear at will. However, Barnabas has also been known to use sorcery. In an early storyline, he attempted to drive Julia mad by conjuring the spirit of her dead colleague, Dave Woodard. In 1795, Barnabas briefly resurrected Josette DuPres, who in the 20th century would warn the Collins family of approaching danger while wandering the Collinwood halls, and he used visions to lure Rev. Trask into a fatal trap. These seemingly magical abilities were never explained, but made Barnabas a deadly protagonist. ==Notes== Jonathan Frid first appeared as Barnabas Collins in 1967 in episode #211, but Collins' hand was briefly seen in the climax to episode #210, prior to Frid's introduction. Series regular Timothy Gordon (uncredited) provided the hand, which was first seen choking Willie Loomis. In a 1971 TV Guide article, Dark Shadows head-writer Sam Hall discussed the outline the show's finale would have taken had it not been canceled sooner than anticipated. Among other things, the plans involved Barnabas, a vampire once again, becoming mysteriously ill. Julia, deducing that his illness was due to his unique connection to Adam, would travel to Singapore to treat Adam, and there fall seriously ill herself. The now-recovered Barnabas would come to her and, at long last, declare his love and ask her to become his wife. Knowing that Angelique would never allow Julia to live, they would remain in the Far East after their marriage, and Julia would permanently cure Barnabas of his vampirism. ==Relationships== *Josette du Pres; fiancee *Angelique Bouchard Collins; rival, later wife *Victoria Winters; romantic interest *Maggie Evans; romantic interest *Sarah Collins; younger sister *Roxanne Drew; romantic interest *Dr. Julia Hoffman; confidante *Quentin Collins; distant cousin *Willie Loomis; human slave and daytime protector ==References== ==Further reading== * Ashley, Amanda.

From 1986 to 1992, he was 20th President of Yale University. Prior, Schmidt was Dean of the Columbia Law School, Harlan Fiske Stone Professor of Constitutional Law, and chairman of Edison Schools (now EdisonLearning). A noted scholar of the First Amendment, the history of the United States Supreme Court and the history of race relations in American law, Schmidt clerked for Earl Warren, Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court.Press release, Benno Schmidt Elected a Director of Argosy's John Marshall Law School/Atlanta, Business Wire, September 28, 2000Benno C. Schmidt Jr. Trustee Biography , Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation website In 1998, Schmidt was appointed Chair of a task force established by New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani to evaluate systemic issues at City University of New York by executive order. After longterm service to CUNY's board of trustees, Governor Andrew Cuomo replaced Schmidt in June 2016, then-Chair, with a new Chair Bill Thompson (New York politician), after an interim report issued, in an ongoing state investigation, issued by the Office of the New York State Inspector General identified a number of systemic problems, largely attributable to CUNY's lack of oversight which led to financial waste and abuse within the CUNY system. ==Early life and career== Schmidt was born in New York City, New York. His father, Benno C. Schmidt, Sr., was a longtime friend and associate of John \\"Jock\\" Hay Whitney. In 1946, Whitney and the elder Schmidt started what was to become the first venture capital firm in the United States, J.H. Whitney & Co.Benno C. Schmidt Financier is Dead at 86, The New York Times, October 22, 1999 Schmidt Jr. attended St. Bernard's School, Phillips Exeter Academy, and Yale University. Upon completion of his undergraduate studies, Schmidt attended Yale Law School. Following graduation, he became a law clerk for Chief Justice of the United States Earl Warren, and thereafter worked for two years in the U.S. Department of Justice, before joining Columbia Law School as a faculty member. His expertise as a legal scholar includes the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, history of race relations in American law, and history of the U.S. Supreme Court. Schmidt achieved tenure at Columbia in 1973, at age 29, and was named the Harlan Fiske Stone Professor of Constitutional Law in 1982. Schmidt was appointed Dean of the law school in 1984, where he served until 1986, before accepting the offer to be President of Yale University. ==Yale University== Schmidt was the President of Yale University from 1986 to 1992. In academics, he instituted several new and successful programs, but his attempt to reduce faculty stirred up controversy. He anticipated the need to repair the University's physical infrastructure, which had fallen into disrepair, but widespread renovation was not carried out until the arrival of Schmidt's successor Rick Levin. Most impressively, Schmidt raised over a billion dollars for Yale. a faster-growing endowment than at any other university. Answering faculty reports of poor writing abilities among incoming freshmen, Schmidt convened a committee to review the issues, and after reflecting upon committee's recommendations, he made significant changes to the writing programs, such as instituting writing tutors at each of the residential colleges, a program which remains today. Under Schmidt's leadership, Yale established the Ethics, Politics and Economics (EP&E;) program,Raymond Carlson, Ten presidents and 130 years at the University , Yale Daily News, January 28, 2008{} which was modeled on the University of Oxford's PP&E; program, and a number of interdisciplinary programs, including environmental sciences, molecular biology, and international studies.New York City Mayor's Press Office, Release #201-98, May 6, 1998 Schmidt questioned the validity of other academic programs, although his proposal to reduce the faculty by 11-percent was not well received. Schmidt was criticized for maintaining his primary residence in New York City during his tenure as president of Yale,Vivian Yee, For modern administrators, one mansion is too many , Yale Daily News, October 1, 2010 with his wife Helen Whitney, a documentary filmmaker.Robert Kolker, The Old College Try, New York magazine, November 22, 1999 Schmidt collaborated with then-Mayor of New Haven, Connecticut John C. Daniels to hammer out a land deal that netted the City of New Haven $2.3 million, in 1990, and millions more in subsequent years. ==Edison Schools== From 1992 to 1997, Schmidt served as the Chief Executive Officer of Edison Schools, a for-profit venture, later renamed EdisonLearning, a for-profit corporation. The organization operates public schools in several districts; President from 1992 to 1997, and Chief Education Officer from 1998 to 1999. From 1997 to 2007, Schmidt served as Edison's Chairman and later a director on the board.Edison Schools website bio of Benno Schmidt ==City University of New York== On May 6, 1998, New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani appointed Schmidt the Chair of a special task force to evaluate longstanding systemic issues at City University of New York, along with committee members Herman Badillo, Heather MacDonald, a fellow at the Manhattan Institute for Policy Research; former New York State Senator Manfred Ohrenstein, Jacqueline V. Brady, a vice president of Nomura Securities International, Incorporated; Richard T. Roberts, Commissioner of the New York City Department of Housing Preservation and Development; and Richard Schwartz, president and CEO of Opportunity America and special assistant to Mayor Giuliani. A year later, on June 7, 1999, the task force report entitled \\"An Institution Adrift\\" characterized the \\"moribund conditions\\" of a public University system \\"caught in a spiral of decline\\". Schmidt and his colleagues called for a complete restructuring of the City University of New York system. Specifically, Schmidt advised CUNY to organize into a unified university system, rather than continue under a system of governance in which each of its 17-campuses runs itself as a separate fiefdom. Similarly, in a section on financial planning, Schmidt advised the University overhaul the passivity of CUNY's central Executive Administration. Four years later, Governor George E. Pataki appointed Benno C. Schmidt Jr. to the position of chairman of the City University of New York Board of Trustees. In 2003, Schmidt was reappointed to the position of Chair. Prior, Schmidt served CUNY's Board in the positions of Vice Chairperson, from 1999 to 2003. In 2006, Governor George Pataki reappointed Schmidt to the position of Chair another seven-year term. In 2016, financial impropriety by the former City College of New York, and an investigation conducted by the New York State Office of the Inspector General, concluding the City University of New York financial system was “ripe for abuse” due to a lack of proper oversight of decentralized funds, resulting in \\"financial waste and abuse,\\" prompting Governor Andrew Cuomo to replace Schmidt with a new chairmen, and most of the CUNY Board of Trustees with a new bloc of politically prominent trustees. ===Other professional and civic service=== Schmidt has served as Director/Trustee of the Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation; chairman of board for the Council on Aid to Education - a not-for- profit providing colleges and universities assessment and strategic planning services; National Humanities Center (NHC), and American Academy of Arts and Sciences, as well as an advisory board member of the Happy Hearts Fund, a nonprofit focused on rapidly rebuilding schools in disaster-stricken areas. Schmidt serves as Vice Chairman on the board of directors of Edison Schools, Inc., after serving as the organization's chairman from 1992 to 2007. In 2014, Schmidt delivered a talk at Yale commencement, entitled \\"Governance for a New Era\\", or \\"The Schmidt Report\\", and subtitled \\"A Blueprint for Higher Education Trustees\\", in which the former University president harshly criticizes passive governance over the nation's public and smaller private institutions, which serve the vast majority of American college students. Schmidt issues a challenge to higher education leadership to step up and take responsibility for doing more to increase academic standards and graduation rates. ==Professional recognition== In 1989 he was appointed Honorary Member of the Order of Australia (AM), for his service to the arts and agricultural development in Australia. In 1991, Schmidt was awarded Honorary Officer status (AO). The inscription reads, \\"For service to the arts, agricultural development and Australian/American relations.\\" In November 2010, Schmidt received the sixth annual Philip Merrill Award of the American Council of Trustees and Alumni (ACTA) for outstanding contributions to liberal arts education.ACTA.org http://www.goacta.org/programs/PMAward.cfm Schmidt made cameo appearances in two Woody Allen films, Hannah and Her Sisters (1986) and Husbands and Wives (1992). ==References== ;Sources * Kelley, Brooks Mather.

SH 35 takes a generally north-south route from Houston to Angleton, junction SH 288, and then roughly parallels the inlets of the Gulf of Mexico in a roughly northeast-southwest course through a low, flat coastal plain. To the south and west of Palacios it gives vistas of several inlets of the Gulf of Mexico, becoming one of the more scenic routes of southern Texas. At Gregory it meets and joins U.S. Highway 181, which coincide to their mutual terminus over Nueces Bay causeway and bridge over Corpus Christi Bay, meeting I-37 and SH 286 at a freeway interchange. Only in its southernmost part near Corpus Christi is State Highway 35 a freeway, although significant stretches of it are divided highway. It is not to be confused with Interstate 35, which it never meets. It is not the shortest or quickest route between Houston and Corpus Christi, which consists largely of US 59 and US 77. ==Route description== SH 35 begins at an interchange with Interstate 37 near downtown Corpus Christi concurrent with US 181. The two highways run as a freeway near Corpus Christi Bay before crossing Nueces Bay into the town of Portland. In Portland, US 181 leaves SH 35, traveling towards Sinton. Just outside Gregory, the freeway segment of SH 35 ends. After crossing FM 136, SH 35 begins to run in an east-west direction to Aransas Pass, before turning towards the northeast. In the town of Rockport, SH 35 runs as a divided expressway before returning to its business loop. The highway passes by the Aransas National Wildlife Refuge before entering into Refugio County. ==Future of SH 35== ===Spur 5=== left In Houston, SH 35 is Telephone Road and Reveille Street from its northern terminus at Interstate 45. An upgrade of the facility (in a slightly different corridor) to freeway standards is planned, tentatively named the Alvin Freeway. As of 2006, only had been built, under the sign Spur 5 (constructed between 1996–99; officially opened September 1999; designated 1998). However, the mainlanes extend less than half a mile south of Interstate 45 adjacent to the campus of the University of Houston. ===Loop 5=== left The number was previously used for Loop 5, which was designated on September 26, 1939 from US 81 through Kyle to US 81 as a renumbering of SH 2 Loop. On September 28, 1950, the section along Burleson St was cancelled and the rest along Center St became Spur 5. On October 27, 1952, Spur 5 was cancelled and transferred to FM 150 (now RM 150). On June 30, 1958, another route, also called Spur 5, was designated from FM 1406 and SH 124 to Interstate 10. On October 31, 1962, The section of the Spur 5 from FM 1406 to SH 73 became a rerouting of SH 124. On August 4, 1988, Spur 5 was cancelled and mileage was transferred to FM 1663. The current route was designated on October 29, 1998. An overlap of Highway 35 with the Gulf Freeway was also constructed in the 1980s. This portion extends from Spur 5 to Dowling Street, a distance of about . This section contains three elevated lanes in each direction (briefly four southbound lanes near the southern terminus). This overlap section is 22 lanes wide, including mainlanes, feeder roads, and a reversible HOV lane.Chapter 4, The Spokes , p. 163 Houston Freeways, Erik Slotboom. Once built, the Alvin Freeway is planned to follow a corridor near Mykawa Road from the terminus to Beltway 8 before returning to its normal undivided state. ==History== left SH 35 was originally proposed on November 19, 1917 as a route from Paris to Houston. On August 21, 1923, the northern half of the highway had been renumbered as SH 49, with the new northern end now going east to the Louisiana border. On November 14, 1927, it extended to Alvin. On April 10, 1934, it had been extended southwest along cancelled SH 58 and SH 57, ending in Gregory. SH 35 Spur was designated from 35 to the Retrieve Prison Farm. This SH 35 Spur was cancelled on July 15, 1935. On February 21, 1938, a new SH 35 Spur was designated to Danbury, as SH 35 was rerouted to bypass Danbury. On September 26, 1939, the section north of Houston was removed when it was renumbered as U.S. Highway 59 and U.S. Highway 84. SH 35 Spur was renumbered as Spur 28. On October 5, 1972, SH 35 was extended to Corpus Christi along US 181. On January 15, 1986, an Angleton bypass opened, with the old route becoming Loop 558. On February 25, 1987, SH 35 was rerouted back over Loop 558, and the bypass became Loop 558 instead (now FM 523). On April 27, 1995, another bypass opened, so that SH 35 no longer goes through Aransas Pass or Rockport. On March 29, 2007, an Old Ocean bypass opened, with the old route becoming Loop 419 (now Spur 419). left SH 35A was a proposed spur route off SH 35 designated on March 18, 1918, with a route splitting off at Livingston, and travelling west to New Waverly. On September 17, 1918, a branch of SH 35 was designated from Livingston via Liberty and Devers to Anahuac. On January 20, 1919, the section of SH 35A south of Coldspring was cancelled, and the section north of Coldspring became the main route. The route from Livingston via Liberty and Devers to Anahuac was renamed SH 35A. On August 21, 1923, the section from Anahuac to Devers was renumbered as SH 61, and the section north of Devers was cancelled. By 1928, the Livingston to Liberty section was restored as SH 132. By 1933, that became a portion of SH 146. SH 35B was a spur of SH 35 designated on November 27, 1922 from Jefferson to the Louisiana border. On August 21, 1923, this was renumbered as SH 49. ==Business routes== SH 35 has four business routes and one former business route. ===Alvin business loop=== left Business State Highway 35-C (formerly Loop 409) is a business loop that runs through Alvin. The road was bypassed on April 1, 1965 by SH 35 and designated Loop 409. The road was redesignated as Business SH 35-C on June 21, 1990. ===West Columbia business loop=== Business State Highway 35-E is a business loop that runs through West Columbia. The route was created in 1998 when SH 35 was rerouted north and west of town. ===Palacios business loop=== left Business State Highway 35-H (formerly Loop 141) is a business loop that runs through Palacios. The road was bypassed on September 21, 1944 by SH 35 and designated Loop 141. The road was redesignated as Business SH 35-H on June 21, 1990. ===Rockport-Aransas Pass business loop=== left Business State Highway 35-L (formerly Loop 70) is a business loop that runs through Rockport. The road was created in 1939 when SH 35 was rerouted south and east of town. The route was redesignated as Business SH 35-L on June 21, 1990. On April 27, 1995 the route was extended north to SH 35 and FM 3036 and south to SH 35 in Aransas Pass over former SH 35 and was also rerouted in Rockport with the old route redesignated as Loop 70. ===Former Aransas Pass business loop=== left Business State Highway 35-M (formerly Loop 81) was a business loop that ran through Aransas Pass. The route was created in 1939 when SH 35 was rerouted in town. The route was redesignated as Business SH 35-M on June 21, 1990, but was redesignated as Loop 90 on April 27, 1995. ==Junction list== All exits are unnumbered. ==See also== * Copano Bay Fishing Pier ==References== ==External links== 035 Category:Transportation in Harris County, Texas Category:Transportation in Brazoria County, Texas Category:Transportation in Matagorda County, Texas Category:Transportation in Jackson County, Texas Category:Transportation in Calhoun County, Texas Category:Transportation in Refugio County, Texas Category:Transportation in Aransas County, Texas Category:Transportation in San Patricio County, Texas Category:Transportation in Nueces County, Texas ","title":"Texas State Highway 35"},{"id":"1284002","text":"Lee Wing-tat (; born 25 December 1955) was a Member of the Legislative Council of Hong Kong (LegCo), returned by direct election as representative of the New Territories West constituency. He was the third Chairman of the Democratic Party (DP). He is seen as a conservative inside the party. ==Early life== A Hakka, Lee was elected vice-chairman of the Hong Kong University Students' Union in 1979. He graduated from the Faculty of Science of the University of Hong Kong with a pass. He first participated in politics in the 1980s and was the Vice-Chairman of the Association for Democracy and People's Livelihood (ADPL). He was elected to the District Council and the Regional Council in 1985 and 1986 respectively. He was a founding member of the Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements of China. In 1989, during the visit of Geoffrey Howe to Hong Kong, Lee protested at the conference and called Howe's speech \\"bullshit\\". Lee left the ADPL and formed the United Democrats of Hong Kong, which developed into the Democratic Party in 1994. He was elected to the Legco in the same year. He once lost his seat in the 2000 election but was re-elected in 2004. He was vice-chairman of Democratic Party from 2002 to 2004 and was elected Chairman at the sixth AGM of the DP in succession to Yeung Sum. His challenger for the Chairman's post, Chan King- ming, was elected Vice-Chairman instead. ==Chairmanship of Democratic Party== ===Chief Executive Election=== In May 2005, Lee declared his intention to run in the Hong Kong Chief Executive Election, but only received 52 nominations and thus failed to get on the ballot. As a result, he withdrew from the election on 15 June. His participation in the election faced great criticisms within the party and the pro-democracy camp. ===Criticisms=== Lee was criticized for suppressing the second-tier members and \\"Young Turks\\" of the party. In early 2006, someone alleged to the Apple Daily that some senior members were involved in spying activities of China. The \\"suspects\\" were all Young Turks and included vice-chairman Chan King Ming and Gary Fan. The Young Turks later held a press conference to criticise the list of \\"suspects\\", with some even directly naming Lee as responsible. ===Departure=== Lee did not seek a second term as party chairman in the party's internal elections in December 2006. ==Views, policy positions and Legco voting== In June 2010, he voted with the party in favour of the government's 2012 constitutional reform package, which included the late amendment by the Democratic Party – accepted by the Beijing government – to hold a popular vote for five new District Council functional constituencies.Cheers and jeers for political reform vote, SCMP, Gary Cheung, Albert Wong and Fanny WY Fung, 25 June 2010 ==References== ==External links== *Personal Website *Facebook Category:1955 births Category:Living people Category:Alumni of St. Paul's College, Hong Kong Category:Alumni of the University of Hong Kong Category:District councillors of Kwai Tsing District Category:Members of the Regional Council of Hong Kong Category:Hong Kong people of Hakka descent Category:Indigenous inhabitants of the New Territories in Hong Kong Category:People from Huiyang Category:Leaders of political parties Category:Charter 08 signatories Category:Democratic Party (Hong Kong) politicians Category:Hong Kong Association for Democracy and People's Livelihood politicians Category:United Democrats of Hong Kong politicians Category:HK LegCo Members 1991–1995 Category:HK LegCo Members 1995–1997 Category:HK LegCo Members 1998–2000 Category:HK LegCo Members 2004–2008 Category:HK LegCo Members 2008–2012 Category:Hong Kong Basic Law Consultative Committee members ","title":"Lee Wing-tat"},{"id":"1284004","text":"José Luis Cuciuffo (1 February 1961 – 11 December 2004) was an Argentine footballer, defender in the 1986 FIFA World Cup-winning Argentine national team.

Rāgarāja Video ', formally called ', is a Buddhist temple in Japan located at the foot of Mount Hiei, in the city of Ōtsu in Shiga Prefecture. It is only a short distance from both Kyoto, and Lake Biwa, Japan's largest lake. The head temple of the Jimon sect of Tendai, it is something of a sister temple to Enryaku-ji, at the top of the mountain, and is one of the four largest temples in Japan. Altogether, there are 40 named buildings in the Mii- dera complex. Mii-dera is temple 14 in the Saigoku Kannon Pilgrimage. ==History== ===Founding, and feuds=== Onjō-ji was founded in the Nara period.Ponsonby-Fane, Richard Arthur Brabazon. (1956). Kyoto: The Old Capital of Japan, 794-1869, p. 114. The temple was founded in 672 following a dispute over Imperial succession. Emperor Tenji had died, and his son was killed by Tenchi's brother, who was then enthroned as Emperor Tenmu. Temmu founded Onjō- ji in honor and memory of his brother. The name Mii-dera (\\"Temple of Three Wells\\") came about nearly two centuries later. It was given this name by Enchin, one of the earliest abbots of the Tendai Sect. The name comes from the springs at the temple which were used for the ritual bathing of newborns, and in honor of Emperors Emperor Tenji and Emperor Tenmu, and Empress Jitō, who contributed to the founding of the temple. Today, the Kondō, or Main Hall, houses a spring of sacred water. Under Enchin's guidance, from 859 to his death in 891, Mii-dera gained power and importance, eventually becoming (along with Tōdai-ji, Kōfuku-ji, and Enryaku-ji) one of the four chief temples charged with the spiritual guidance and protection of the capital. It was during this time also that Enryaku-ji and Mii-dera split away from one another, developing two branches of the Tendai sect, called Jimon and Sanmon. For the most part, this was more a geographic rivalry than an ideological schism, but it was an intense one nonetheless, and only grew more severe after Enchin's death. The rivalry turned violent in the second half of the 10th century, over a series of official appointments to other temples, and similar slights. The zasu of Enryaku-ji in 970 formed the first permanent standing army to be recruited by a religious body. Mii-dera can be assumed to have established one very soon afterwards. In 989, a former abbot of Mii-dera by the name of Yokei was to become abbot of Enryaku-ji; but none of the monks of Enryaku-ji would perform services under his direction. He soon resigned. But in 993, the monks of Mii-dera took revenge, destroying a temple where Ennin, founder of Enryaku-ji's Sanmon sect, had once lived. The monks from Enryaku-ji retaliated, destroying more than 40 places associated with Enchin. In the end, over 1,000 monks of Enchin's Jimon sect fled permanently to Mii-dera, cementing the split between the two Sects. Over the course of the 10th, 11th and 12th centuries, there continued to be similar incidents, over the appointment of abbots (zasu), involving many sōhei, or warrior monks. Mii-dera was burned to the ground by the sōhei of Enryaku-ji four times in the 11th century alone. There were, however, times that the two united against a common enemy, including an attack on the Kōfuku-ji in Nara in 1081 (avenging the burning of the Mii-dera by Kōfuku-ji monks that same year), and a united attack on Nara once more in 1117. ===The Genpei Wars=== At the end of the 12th century, the attentions of the monks of Mount Hiei were turned towards a greater conflict: the Genpei War. The Taira and Minamoto families supported different claimants to the Chrysanthemum Throne, and in June 1180, the Minamoto brought their claimant, Prince Mochihito, to the Mii-dera, fleeing from Taira samurai. Mii-dera asked for aid from Enryaku-ji, but was denied. The monks of the Mii-dera joined the Minamoto army, and fled to the Byōdō-in, a Fujiwara clan villa, which had been converted to a monastery by Mii-dera monks (see Battle of Uji (1180)). Angered at the Mii-dera/Minamoto alliance, Taira no Kiyomori ordered the destruction of Mii-dera, and of many of the temples of Nara (see Siege of Nara). The monks of Mii-dera figured once more in the Genpei War, fighting alongside Taira sympathisers against Minamoto no Yoshinaka, who invaded Kyoto in 1184, setting fire to the Hōjūjidono Palace and kidnapping the retired emperor, Shirakawa II. Following the Genpei War, there was a long period of relative peace, as the temples of Kyoto and Nara, including the Mii-dera, were rebuilt. As the temples regained strength, rivalries reappeared, though little to no violence actually erupted between Mii-dera and Enryaku-ji. In 1367, when a novice from Mii-dera was killed at a toll barrier established by the temple of Nanzen-ji, warrior monks from Mii- dera set out to attack Nanzen-ji; when the shōguns forces were sent to quell the rebellion, they discovered Mii-dera's monks to be supported by sōhei from Enryaku-ji and Kōfuku-ji as well. A year later, another battle erupted, over comments made by the abbot of Nanzen-ji; the monks of Mii-dera, along with their allies, defeated the shogun's forces once again. ===Sengoku period and beyond=== In the late 16th century, Mii-dera, along with many of the other nearby temples, sought alliances, for military (defensive) strength, as well as military power. The territories of the Asai and Asakura families were closest to Mount Hiei, but these families, as well as others the temples had allied with, were rivals of Oda Nobunaga. These two families suffered heavy defeats at the hands of Nobunaga and his chief general Hideyoshi Toyotomi, so in 1571 they sought a stronger alliance with the temples. That same year, Nobunaga set to destroying everything on Mount Hiei, starting with the town of Sakamoto at the foot of the mountain, and setting his sights on Enryaku-ji at the summit. Much of Mii-dera was destroyed, as the warrior monks failed against Nobunaga's large and highly trained samurai army. Following these attacks, the monks of Mount Hiei were finally granted a reprieve, and rebuilt their temples once more. Mii-dera has never been attacked or destroyed since then. ==Halls and treasures== Within the Kondō and Hondo (the Main Hall and Buddha Hall) of Mii-dera, there are at least six statues of the Buddha, sacred personal possessions of various Emperors, including Emperor Tenji, which are hidden away and shown only on rare, special occasions, as well as one large statue of the Miroku, or Maitreya, Buddha in the center of the Hall. The Kondo was built in 1599, and is a replacement for the original, built in 672 and destroyed by the Taikō Hideyoshi Toyotomi. Mii-dera also has a Kannon-do, built in 1072, a hall dedicated to Kannon, Bodhisattva of Compassion. Mii-dera is the fourteenth temple in a Pilgrimage of 33 Temples devoted to Kannon in the Kansai area. ==See also== *List of Buddhist temples *List of Buddhist temples in Kyoto * For an explanation of terms concerning Japanese Buddhism, Japanese Buddhist art, and Japanese Buddhist temple architecture, see the Glossary of Japanese Buddhism. *List of National Treasures of Japan (residences) *List of National Treasures of Japan (temples) * List of National Treasures of Japan (ancient documents) *List of National Treasures of Japan (paintings) *List of National Treasures of Japan (sculptures) ==Notes== == References == * Iwao, Seiichi, Teizō Iyanaga, Susumu Ishii, Shōichirō Yoshida, et al.

He was the engineer of the first-ever working American gasoline- powered car and co-founder of Duryea Motor Wagon Company. He was born near Canton, Illinois, a son of George Washington Duryea and Louisa Melvina Turner, and died in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, but spent most of his life working in Springfield, Massachusetts. It was in Springfield that Charles and his brother, Frank, produced and road-tested America’s first gasoline-powered car. 1894 Duryea Automobile at the Tallahassee Antique Car Museum == Biography == Charles Duryea was born on December 15, 1861, near Canton, Illinois, to George Washington Duryea and Louisa Melvina Turner. Duryea and his brother Frank (1869–1967) were initially bicycle makers in Washington, D.C., but later became world-renowned as the first American gasoline-powered car manufacturers, headquartered in Springfield, Massachusetts. Generally speaking, Charles engineered the automobiles, while Frank built, tested and raced them. === Tests of the first, gasoline-powered automobile === On September 21, 1893, the Duryea brothers road-tested the first-ever, working American gasoline-powered automobile on the Howard Bemis farm in Chicopee, Massachusetts.https://www.hemmings.com/blog/2012/04/19/duryeas- debut-120-years-of-the-american-automobile-sorta/ The Duryea's \\"motor wagon\\" was a used horse drawn buggy that the brothers had purchased for $70 and into which they had installed a 4 HP, single cylinder gasoline engine. The car (buggy) had a friction transmission, spray carburetor and low tension ignition. Frank Duryea test drove it again on November 10 — this time in a prominent location: past their garage at 47 Taylor Street in Springfield. The next day it was reported by The Republican newspaper with great fanfare. This particular car was put into storage in 1894 and stayed there until 1920, when it was rescued by a former Duryea engineer Inglis M. Uppercu and presented to the United States National Museum. Duryea was inducted into the Automotive Hall of Fame in 1973. === The Duryea Motor Wagon Company === Mayor William P. Yoerg, of Holyoke (center-left), also a tire salesman and garage owner, presents an award to Charles Duryea for being the first to use pneumatic tires on an automobile, effectively starting the American automobile tire industry On November 28, 1895, in Chicago, their vehicle, driven by brother Frank, had won America's first car race. It ran to Evanston, Illinois and back. The only other finisher was one of three Benz cars mostly made in Germany. After Frank won, demand grew for the Duryea Motor Wagon. In 1896, the Duryea Brothers produced 13 cars by hand – in their garage at 47 Taylor Street – and thus Duryea became the first-ever commercially produced vehicle, and also the largest automobile factory in the United States. For the history of the company and its cars, see Duryea Motor Wagon Company. Duryea sought out investors and buyers while his brother, Frank Duryea, primarily handled the mechanical side of the business. A Duryea car was involved in America's first known auto accident. New York City motorist Henry Wells hit a bicyclist with his new Duryea. The rider suffered a broken leg, Wells spent a night in jail and the nation's first traffic accident was recorded. In 1913, George Vanderbilt purchased and drove a Stevens-Duryea, but was one of few people in the United States who could afford one. His 1913 Duryea is Vanderbilt's only original car kept at his Biltmore Estate. Duryea ceased manufacturing in 1917. Duryea died of a heart attack in Philadelphia on September 28, 1938, and was buried in Ivy Hill Cemetery, West Oak Lane. ==Legacy== The annual Duryea Hillclimb is named in his honor. ==See also== *Elwood Haynes, previously credited with the first American gasoline automobile by the Smithsonian Institution == References == ==Further reading== Duryea, Charles; Homans, James E.

It is one of only a handful of collectible dice games produced in the early 1990s. The races and monsters in Dragon Dice were created by Lester Smith and include some creatures unique to a fantasy setting and others familiar to the Dungeons & Dragons role-playing game. The game simulates combat between armies of fantasy races for control of a young world named Esfah. Dragon Dice classifies magical power by element: air, earth, fire, water, and death. Nearly every race in the game is composed of two of these elements. In the original edition, dragons and dragon-related dice (Dragonkin) were all composed of a single element each. However, SFR has since released \\"hybrid\\" dragons representing each two-element combination, in addition to white and ivory dragons (where ivory represents no elemental affinity and white represents affinity with all elements). ==Premise== Dragon Dice is set in the fictional world of \\"Esfah.\\" Esfah was created by the goddess Nature, and the Father of All. These two deities had several children, each of whom represented one of the major elements described by Plato (Fire - Firiel, Earth - Eldurim, Wind - Ailuril, Water - Aguarehl), and one of whom was named \\"Death.\\" After Nature's children created two races, the Coral Elves (Selumari) and Dwarves (Vagha), Death created its own set of races, the Goblins (Trogs) and Lava Elves (Morehl), bent on causing mischief and discord. Nature and her children became enveloped in a continuing war with Death, each causing the birth of several new races, including the Amazons, Firewalkers, Undead, Feral, Swampstalkers, Frostwings, Scalders, and Treefolk. Players, acting as army Commanders, assemble race units and compete against each other in a battle on selected terrain. Commanders may summon Dragons, representing the cardinal elements, which attack each other and all other creatures. Legendary units, Dragonhunter and Dragonmaster leaders of The Eldarim, each holding the power of one of Esfah's elements, grew within the ebb and flow of the war.http://www.sfr-inc.com Players then use their dice to represent either the forces of Good or Evil in this setting. For example, you could be anyone from the Coral Elf Commander, leading your army on a path to destroy Death races, driven by that which stole your peaceful existence and attacked Mother Nature, to the Treefolk General, leading a harmonious balanced life in Water and Earth. Or, maybe you just want to light stuff on Fire raging in tumultuous Air tides. ==Goal== The goal of a standard game of Dragon Dice is to capture two of any of the terrains being fought over. This is achieved by one player's armies controlling two terrains that have their terrain die turned to the eighth face, as explained below. The game can also be won if a player has the last surviving in play. Any number of players can share in this struggle.Page 3 of Dragon Dice Rules (currently 2.6a as of May 29, 2012).

The color(s) of the dice identify each race and represent the elements that comprise each. The dice come in four sizes, each corresponding to a particular amount of \\"health\\" from 1 to 4 points. One side on each unit die has an ID icon, which identifies the unit and generates results equal to the health of the die towards whatever action is being rolled for. The remaining sides have either normal action icons (representing magic, maneuvers, melee, missiles, or saves) or special action icons (SAI) that generate special effects or results. Generally, the more health a unit has, the more icons it will have. Units are also divided by class as well as size, reflecting their specialty. Most races have five classes of unit, plus monsters (or champions for the Eldarim), but while most races share a number of classes (Cavalry, Magic, Melee), some are unique to certain races (Light Magic, Light Melee, Light Missile).Summary of the icons of each race on pp. 65-77 of Dragon Dice rules, version 2.6a. MONSTERS are ten-sided dice that are units and have a single icon on each face which generate 4 points of effect (i.e.: 4 results) with the possible exception of some SAI effects. Monsters are part of a player's army and each one counts as four points of health.Page 21 of Dragon Dice rulesm version 2.6a. Players build armies of units to a predetermined amount of health. The standard game is 36 points of health, but smaller and even larger games are not uncommon. There are other six-sided dice that are mono-colored called Dragonkin that are not considered units.Page 52 of the Dragon Dice rules, version 2.6a. There are other ten-sided dice that are mono-colored called artifacts that are a type of magic item.Page 54 of the Dragon Dice rules, version 2.6a Both are part of the Advanced Rules. ===Terrains=== TERRAINS are eight-sided and have two colors that indicate of what elements the terrain is composed. For example, a Swampland terrain is green and gold, showing it is made of earth and water. Each face of a terrain dice is numbered and has an icon for missile, melee, or magic. The number and the icon shown indicate how far apart armies at that terrain are. If a Magic icon (starburst) is showing, then the armies are so far apart they can only cast spells. A Missile face (arrow) means they are close enough to shoot at each other, and a Melee icon (sword) means they are close enough for hand-to- hand combat to take place. Each player brings two terrains to the game, one Home terrain and one proposed Frontier terrain. Some races gain benefits such as extra maneuvers or saves if they are at a certain terrain. The goal of the game is to control two such terrains by \\"turning\\" them to the 8th face. An army capturing an 8th face also gains double maneuvers and double saves. The eighth face of terrains has one of four special icons: City, Temple, Tower and Standing Stones. Each gives an additional bonus to the army that possesses them. EXAMPLES: An army with a Temple is immune to the effects of Death (black) magic and can \\"bury\\" dead units to render them unusable for magic. A City allows for the recruiting or promoting of units, a Tower allows for a Missile action to any other terrain, and Standing Stones allow that army to cast magic of that terrain's color, even if the army is not made up of those colors. SFR released the \\"Battlefields\\" expansion in August 2010, featuring two new terrains: Feylands (green/red) and Wastelands (blue/red). Four new 8th face icons were also introduced that can only be used at the Frontier location: Dragon Lair, Grove, Castle, and Vortex. Minor terrains (smaller eight-sided dice) were re-released as part of this expansion. ===Dragons=== DRAGONS are twelve-sided and of a single (or two mixed) . Each face has the image of a dragon part that will show what action the dragon takes when rolled against an army. Dragons must be summoned to a terrain through the use of magic. Players do not control dragons they summon, so bringing one into play can be risky since the possibility exists that it may attack the very player that summoned it. One dragon is brought to the game for every 24 health of units in play. Thus, in a 48 health game players would bring two dragons. SFR has released ten 2-colored HYBRID DRAGONS, 5 Ivory/color hybrid dragons, and a white dragon in both wyrm and drake forms.See SFR website: www.sfr-inc.com With the advent of these hybrid dragons, the total number of dragons is 44; 5 each of elemental wyrms and drakes, 10 each of hybrid wyrms and drakes, one each of ivory wyrm and drake, and one each of white wyrm and drake. ===Expansions Introduced by SFR=== 2009: \\"Acolytes of the Eldarim\\": This fully expanded race now includes 1-health commons, 2-health uncommons, and 3-health rares, along with new racial abilities and spells.Page 25 of Dragon Dice rules, version 2.6a. Like the DragonHunters and DragonMasters, these dice are monochromatic, and available in black, blue, gold, green, or red. (Upon closer inspection, the dice themselves are a combination of ivory and the main color, which distinguishes themselves from Dragonkin.) 2009: \\"Dragonkin Expansion\\" re-releases the Dragonkin, which are 6-sided one-color units that can be summoned to a terrain and fight with the army there. Dragonkin come in 1-health commons, 2-health uncommons, 3-health rares, and 4-health Dragonkin Champions. Dragonkin will not fight against a dragon of the same color. For every full three points of other units a player brings to a game, he is allowed (but not required), to bring one point of dragonkin. Dragonkin are part of the Advanced Rules and start in the Summoning Pool.Page 52 of Dragon Dice rules, version 2.6a. 2010: \\"Battlefields\\" includes two new basic terrains types, the Feylands (Fire and Water) and the Wastelands (Fire and Air). The terrains printed in white ink have the same four 8th Face types (City, Standing Stones, Temple, Tower) and are a part of the basic game. Also released as a part of this expansion are minor terrain versions of these new terrains (as well as Coastlands, Flatlands, Highlands, Swamplands). These minor terrains represent lesser objectives that may give your army a needed boost if you're willing to take a risk. Minor terrains are part of the Advanced Rules.Page 50 of Dragon Dice rules, version 2.6a. The Battlefields expansion also contains special terrains printed in gold ink with new 8th Faces: the Dragon's Lair, Grove, Castle, and Vortex. These special gold- printed terrains can only be placed at the Frontier. They can never be home terrains, so there will only be a maximum of one special terrain in play during a game. Otherwise, special terrains act just like normal terrains, except than their icon progression is set by the eighth face icon, not by their elemental colors.Page 51 of Dragon Dice rules, version 2.6a. 2011: \\"DragonCrusader and DragonZealots\\" are Eldarim Champions (along with DragonLords / DragonMasters and DragonSlayers/DragonHunters) and have the ability to control dragons. Each DragonCrusader or DragonZealot that rolls its SFR logo allows the acting player to control one dragon. The dragon may be held motionless (i.e.: it is not rolled) and the army can attack it normally. Or the dragon may be made part of the attack against other dragons.Page 26 of Dragon Dice rules, version 2.6a. ==The Races== Each of the races of Dragon Dice has unique icons representing the basic action types - for instance Missile is a bow for Coral Elves, a slingshot for Goblins, and a flintlock pistol for Lava Elves. Each race also has access to different special icons on their rare or monster units. Beginning with Firewalkers, each later race also had unique spells using their magic color that only they could cast. * Coral Elves (blue and green) are peaceable sea-dwelling elves who travel in flying \\"coral ships\\". * Dwarves (red and gold) are stalwart warriors with horned helmets, two-headed axes and shields. * Goblins (gold and black) are disgusting, ravenous creatures who ride wolves or leopards and cast curses. * Lava Elves (red and black) are fierce death-mages who wield pistols and rapiers. * Amazons (ivory with purple icons), the game's only humans, cast magic based on the terrain they're stationed at. (Per Chuck Pint, President of SFR, Amazons are WHITE units, NOT IVORY) (Per the rulebook, \\"Amazons are ivory, which signifies that they are not inherently any specific aspect...\\") * Firewalkers (blue and red) are warriors from the sun who flew to Esfah to join its battles for sport. * Undead (black and ivory with green icons), the reanimated dead, can use only death magic. * Ferals (gold and blue) are various races of humanoid beasts or birds who fight with stone knives. * Swamp Stalkers (green and black) are hideous snake-people who mutate other races into themselves. * Frostwings (black and blue) are furry flying creatures with an affinity for ice. (As the last TSR-published \\"kicker\\" pack, Frostwings were underprinted and have become atypically rare.) * Scalders (red and green), the only \\"kicker\\" produced by Wizards of the Coast before the game's production ceased, are twisted, malicious faeries and can harm those who attack them. * Treefolk (gold and green) were printed by SFR after they acquired the abandoned licence. As they use the last unique combination of the game's five colors, additional multi-colour races are unlikely. * Eldarim are the original race of Esfah, and are represented by single colour promo dice called Champions, worth four health each. In 2009, SFR released a new expansion called \\"Acolytes of Eldarim,\\" single colour units of one to three health who have given up their racial heritage to learn from the Eldarim Champions. This \\"kicker\\" includes a new class of unit, the Shield Bearer. ==Gameplay== Before the start of the game, units are divided into three separate armies, Home, Horde and Campaign. Each starting army must have at least one die, but no more than half the total health of the entire army (but this restriction only applies to the starting set-up and no longer applies after the game begins). The Home army defends a player's Home terrain, the Horde army is placed at an opponent's Home terrain, and the Campaign army is placed at the Frontier. Before the start of the game, players roll their Horde armies, and the player with the most maneuver points may choose the Frontier terrain, or to go first.pp. 4, 5, and 7 of Dragon Dice rules, version 2.6a. On a player's turn, one is allowed two marches, or actions, with their armies. What action they may take depends on what icon is showing on the terrain face. However, a single army may not take two marches in the same turn. EXAMPLE: A player has pulled all of their units into a single army at one terrain. On their turn they get only one march with that army. ===Maneuver=== Before taking an action with their army, a player may choose to attempt to move the terrain face up or down. They announce this, and if unopposed, change the terrain. If an opponent at the same terrain wishes to oppose the move, then both players roll their army, counting maneuver and ID icons for the total number of points rolled. If the acting player's total is equal to or exceeds the opposing player's total, then they win and may turn the terrain die one face up or down. EXAMPLE: The terrain is a Coastland at 5, a missile face, and the player has a mostly melee army. By rolling to maneuver, and generating more maneuver and ID icons than any declared opponents, the acting player may turn it to 6, a melee face, which allows them to skirmish or charge their opponent. ===Magic=== If the terrain face is a Magic icon, a player may attempt to cast magic and roll their army, counting magic icons and IDs. Those dice on which an ID is rolled may double their magic total if they match at least one color of the terrain. After tallying points, the acting player may cast spells to help their own armies or hinder an opponent's. Spells are assorted by color, and have varying effects such as inflicting damage, adding protection, or even summoning a dragon. ===Missile=== While at a terrain with a Missile face, the acting player can choose to shoot at an army at the same terrain or at the frontier. The army is rolled and all missile and ID icons are counted for the total number of hits. The targeted army is rolled for saves, and if enough saves are not generated, units are removed from the army and sent to the Dead Unit Area (DUA). The targeted player does not get to roll a return shot. EXAMPLE: the acting player rolls 5 missile icons and 2 IDs for 7 hits. The targeted player rolls only 4 saves, so would send a total of 3 health of units to the DUA. ===Melee=== At a terrain with a melee (sword) icon showing, the acting player can choose to engage their opponent in a skirmish. The army is rolled, and all melee and ID icons are counted for the total number of hits on the targeted army. That army is then rolled for saves (like in a missile attack), and if enough saves are not rolled, the appropriate number of units are sent to the DUA. The targeted army then rolls for a counter-attack against the acting player's army, who must then save against the attack or send units to the DUA as well. EXAMPLE: The acting player declares a skirmish and rolls his army. He rolls 4 melee hits and an ID icon on a two health unit, for a total of six melee hits. The opposing army rolls for saves and generates four saves. That army would immediately lose two health worth of units. After choosing what to remove, the opposing army now reciprocates by rolling for melee hits, and the original acting army makes a save roll. In the earliest editions of the game, the acting player may choose to engage in a charge attack. In a charge, the attacking army is rolled and all melee, maneuver, and ID icons are counted as hits (icons such as trample, which count as either maneuver or melee, in this context will count for both and are therefore worth double). The defending army is rolled at the same time, with saves tallied to block opposing hits and melee hits tallied to inflict damage on the attacking army, which cannot roll saves of its own. EXAMPLE: The acting player declares a charge and rolls his army. She rolls 5 melee hits, 2 maneuvers, and 3 trample icons. Simultaneously, the defender rolls 6 saves, 3 melee hits, and 3 trample. The acting player tallies 5 melee + 2 maneuver + 6 trample (3 melee PLUS 3 maneuver, as the trample counts for both) for a total of 13 hits. The defender saves against 6 of these hits, taking 7 damage, AND hits back against the charging army for 6 damage (3 melee hits + 3 trample - the maneuver aspect of trample does not count as hits for non-charging armies). Ultimately, the acting army will remove 6 health of units to the DUA, and the defending army will remove 7. In the revised editions of the game, charge and skirmish options disappeared in favor of rules clarity and for the sake of cohesive game play. In the modern version of the game, Melee actions follow the above mentioned \\"skirmish\\" rule and \\"charging\\" disappeared in favor of advanced racial abilities. ===Reinforce and reserves=== When a player has taken both marches, they may withdraw any number of units from terrains into the Reserves area. These units may then be sent to any terrain at the end of the player's next turn during the Reinforcement phase, but before others are withdrawn into the Reserves. Units in the Reserves may take a march, but they may not maneuver a terrain and are limited to attempting friendly magic (they cannot target an opposing army or affect a terrain). The one exception to this is Amazons, which may take a missile action to their Home terrain or the Frontier while in reserves. ===Special Action Icons=== Some units and monsters have SAIs (Special Action Icons). For example, a CANTRIP icon allows for up to 4 points of magic during any action other than maneuvers that can be used immediately. A BULLSEYE icon rolled during a missile action targets an individual unit that must for saves before the targeted army does. The SMITE icon inflicts up to 4 hits on a target army, who cannot save against them and must remove that many health from the army before rolling for saves. ===Winning the game=== A player wins by maneuvering two terrains to the 8th face, or through attrition by removing all of an opponent's pieces from the game. ==Publication history== Dragon Dice was released in 1995 as a part of TSR's 20th anniversary. Shannon Appelcline noted that, compared to Spellfire, \\"Dragon Dice (1995) was a more innovative approach to the collectible industry. It consisted of collectible dice, each of which had unique faces that offered unique powers. At first Dragon Dice seemed like a hit, though [...] that changed dramatically within the year.\\" By 1996, TSR was struggling to pay off loans and get ahead of its debt by making a big push into the book trade, which included \\"sending massive reorders of Dragon Dice into book stores and increasing hardcover publication from two books a year to twelve. Both of these expansions flopped and because bookstore sales are ultimately returnable, TSR was the one left holding the bag. As 1996 ended Random House informed TSR that they would be returning about a third of TSR’s products – several million dollars’ worth.\\" As a result, there were full trailer- truckloads of Dragon Dice stored in the TSR warehouse by the time Wizards of the Coast bought TSR in 1997. TSR produced the starter races and several expansion packs, printing a total of eight races and several promotional dice for the game. After TSR's purchase by Wizards of the Coast, one additional race was created. Several paperback novels were written for the game along with two short works which accompanied gaming accessories (Tome of the Tarvanehl and Heart of Stone and Flame). The first novel was titled Cast of Fate by Allen Varney in 1996. The book was 310 pages and contained a new ivory Dragonslayer die contained in a hole cut through the pages of the book in the bottom right corner with all text arranged to accommodate the hole. The second was intended to do the same; Army of the dead by Edo Van Belkom was supposed to release in 1997, also with a dragonslayer die in a hole in the book. Without the hole in the book, it did not release until 2003 via Prime Books when Wizards of the Coast returned the rights to Van Belkom at his request. A third novel scheduled during the TSR planned releases was titled Time of the Champions by Ed Stark it was advertised but apparently never published. Chill Wind, by Joseph Joiner was released in Oct, 2011 and was planned to be a larger sequel. Notes were drawn up for future books, but Joiner passed away prior to releasing a sequel. A large gumball machine was erected at GenCon that dispensed a Red or Blue Dragonlord die. A computerized version, Dragon Dice, was published in 1997 by Interplay. Wizards of the Coast sold the game to SFR, Inc. on the verge of disposing of a large number of unsold dice into a German landfill. Episode and its notes reference the near-discontinuance of Dragon Dice. As of 2008, SFR has produced a tenth race and completed two sets of promotional dice. ==Reception== Steve Faragher reviewed Dragon Dice for Arcane magazine, rating it a 9 out of 10 overall. Faragher comments that \\"So the long and the short of it is that this really is a superb game. the strategies available are virtually limitless and, in common with other great games, it's hard to imagine two conflicts ever being the same.\\" Steve Faragher reviewed the Monsters & Amazons expansion set for Arcane magazine, rating it a 6 out of 10 overall. Faragher comments that \\"So, interesting new dice but frankly not enough of them.\\" Chris Baylis reviewed the Firewalkers expansion set for Arcane magazine, rating it an 8 out of 10 overall. Baylis comments that \\"Firewalkers [...] are also much better balanced, in terms of dice variation as well as distribution, than the Amazons, particularly for a single-colour army.\\" In 1995, Dragon Dice won the Origins Award for Best Fantasy or Science-Fiction Board Game.http://gama.org/origins-awards/sample- page/origins-awards-winners-the-1990s/the-1995-origins-awards/ ==See also== *Game design ==Notes and references== ==External links== *SFR, Inc.

She is most known for her roles in Nazi-era films. ==Early life== Söderbaum was born in Stockholm, Sweden; her father, Professor Henrik Gustaf Söderbaum (1862–1933), was the permanent secretary of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. After both her parents died shortly after one another, Söderbaum moved to Berlin and enrolled in a theatre school. ==Career== ===Nazi era=== Beginning in 1935, Söderbaum starred in a number of films with director Veit Harlan, whom she married in 1939. Harlan and Söderbaum made ten films together for the then state-controlled film production company UFA until 1945. According to film historian Antje Ascheid, Söderbaum is frequently identified as \\"most singularly representative of the Nazi ideal, as the quintessential Nazi star\\". As a beautiful Swedish blonde, Söderbaum had the baby-doll looks that epitomized the model Aryan woman. In fact, she had already played the role of the innocent Aryan in a number of feature films and was well-known to German audiences. Her youth and beauty made her a symbol of health and purity and thus an exemplary specimen of the Nazi ideal of womanhood. In a number of her films, she had been imperiled by the threat of rassenschande (\\"racial pollution\\"). Two such roles were Dorothea Sturm, the doomed heroine of the antisemitic historical melodrama Jud Süß, who commits suicide by drowning after being raped by the villain and Anna in Die goldene Stadt, a Sudeten German whose desire for the city (in defiance of blood and soil) and whose seduction by a Czech result in her drowning suicide. As a result of her watery fate in these two films, as well as a similar end in her debut in Harlan's 1938 film Jugend, she was given the mock honorary title Reichswasserleiche (\\"Drowned Corpse of the Reich\\"). Other roles included Elske in Die Reise nach Tilsit, the wholesome German wife whose husband betrays her with a Polish woman, but finally returns, repentant; Elisabeth in Immensee, who marries a rich landowner to forget her unrequited love, and in the end decides to remain faithful even after she is widowed and her lover returns; Aels in Opfergang, a woman who dies after her love affair; Luise Treskow in The Great King, a miller's daughter who encourages Frederick the Great; and Maria in Kolberg, a peasant girl who loyally supports the resistance to Napoleon and is the only survivor of her family. ===Postwar=== In the first few years after the war, Söderbaum was often heckled off the stage and even had rotten vegetables thrown at her. In subsequent years, she frequently expressed regret for her roles in anti-semitic films. After her husband was again permitted to direct films, Söderbaum played leading roles in a number of his films. These included Blue Hour (1952), The Prisoner of the Maharaja (1953), Betrayal of Germany (1954), and I Will Carry You on My Hands (1958). Their last joint project was a 1963 theater production of August Strindberg's A Dream Play in Aachen. After Harlan's death in 1964, Söderbaum became a noted fashion photographer. In 1974 she took a role in Hans-Jürgen Syberberg's film Karl May. In 1983 she published her memoirs under the title Nichts bleibt immer so (\\"Nothing Stays That Way Forever\\"). In her later years, Söderbaum faded into obscurity but still took roles in three movies and the television series The Bergdoktor. Her last film was with Hugh Grant in the thriller Night Train to Venice in 1994. She died in 2001 in a nursing home in Hitzacker, Lower Saxony, Germany. == Filmography == * Uncle Bräsig (1936) as Minning * ' (1938) as Ännchen * Covered Tracks (1938) as Séraphine Lawrence * The Immortal Heart (1939) as Ev Henlein * The Journey to Tilsit (1939) as Elske Settegast * Jud Süß (1940) as Dorothea Sturm * The Great King (1942) as Luise Treskow * The Golden City (1942) as Anna Jobst * Immensee (1943) * Opfergang (1945) as Aels Flodéen * Kolberg (1944) as Maria * Immortal Beloved (1951) as Katharina von Hollstein * Hanna Amon (1951) * The Blue Hour (1953) * Stars Over Colombo (1953) * The Prisoner of the Maharaja (1954) * ' (1954) * Two Hearts in May (1958) * I'll Carry You in My Arms (1958) * Die blonde Frau des Maharadscha (1962) * Karl May (1974) * Let's Go Crazy (1983) * Das bleibt das kommt nie wieder (1992) * Night Train to Venice (Train to Hell) (1993) * Der Bergdoktor: Series 1, Episode 11 \\"Der Sinn des Lebens\\" (\\"The Meaning of Life\\") (1993) ==ReferencesPhotographs and bibliography Category:1912 births Category:2001 deaths Category:20th-century German actresses Category:20th- century memoirists Category:Actresses from Stockholm Category:German film actresses Category:German memoirists Category:Photographers from Berlin Category:Swedish emigrants to Germany Category:Swedish film actresses Category:Swedish memoirists Category:Swedish photographers Category:Volpi Cup for Best Actress winners Category:Women memoirists ","title":"Kristina Söderbaum"},{"id":"1284115","text":"Carol Molnau (born September 17, 1949) served as the 46th lieutenant governor of Minnesota, from 2003 to 2011. She formerly served as head of the Minnesota Department of Transportation (Mn/DOT). She is known for her opposition to state funding of the mass transit systems of the Minneapolis–Saint Paul metropolitan area. Born in Carver County, Minnesota, she was elected as a member of the Minnesota House of Representatives in 1992 and served five terms. Molnau announced she would not run for re-election after she sold her farm to developers and would no longer be living in the area she represented. She joined the Pawlenty ticket shortly thereafter, and was elected Lieutenant Governor in 2002 and re-elected in 2006. ==Confirmation as Mn/DOT commissioner== The Minnesota Senate Transportation Committee voted in March 2004 to remove Molnau from her position as commissioner of Mn/DOT with some lawmakers citing that she lacked vision for the transportation needs of the state. The full senate later voted to confirm her. In Summer 2005, rumors began circulating that Governor Tim Pawlenty would drop Molnau from his ticket when he sought re-election in 2006, mainly because of their differences over state funding for the planned Northstar Commuter Rail linking St. Cloud and the Twin Cities. Pawlenty denied those rumors on August 1, 2005 and Molnau remained on the ticket, winning reelection on November 7, 2006. Then, in January 2007, as part of a renewed threat to remove her, Senator Steve Murphy opined that under Molnau the state's transportation infrastructure was \\"crumbling.\\" ==State Highway 62== In 2006, Molnau requested bids for a major highway reconstruction of Minnesota State Highway 62 and Interstate Highway 35W. Molnau's office required applicants to pay all construction projects as they did the work, with the state reimbursing the contractor over the course of the project. As a result, no contractors submitted bids and the project was shelved until new funding streams could be developed a year later. ==I-35W bridge collapse== In 2007 the I-35W Mississippi River bridge collapsed in Minneapolis. Molnau was unable to immediately assist in her capacity as Commissioner of Transportation because she was in China at the time. Molnau responded to complaints over her absence by stating she was presenting a paper on transportation. Subsequently some state legislators blamed her for her role as transportation commissioner for failing to advocate for robust funding of the state's transportation infrastructure, while Governor Pawlenty continued to support her. Molnau was a controversial transportation commissioner; while she does not have a college degree and said she did not read bridge inspection reports, she frequently promoted herself as a transportation expert while refusing to ask for funding to fix hundreds of problem bridges in Minnesota. She defended her leadership, citing that three members of her leadership team were engineers. The bridge that collapsed was one of those problem bridges that inspectors found to be structurally deficient. The required repairs were not made before the tragedy. A plan to strengthen the fatiguing steel trusses under the bridge was scrapped, some claim in part due to the $2 million cost of those repairs, although Mn/DOT engineers \\"scoffed\\" at the suggestion that this was a major factor in the decision. From 2003 through August 2007, Mn/DOT had reduced its staff of 4,500 by 600. Her critics claim that her focus was on new roads—not maintenance of existing ones. In September 2007 the Minneapolis Star-Tribune reported that Molnau's Director of Emergency Response was attending a class at Harvard on Emergency Response. The Director did not return when the bridge collapsed, and proceeded to spend several days in Washington, DC before returning to Minnesota over a week later. The Director was terminated after the outcome of an investigation by the State's Legislative Auditor and the Department of Transportation. == Removal as transportation commissioner == After the Interstate 35W bridge collapse some lawmakers publicly questioned her dual role as Lieutenant Governor and Transportation Commissioner. However, Molnau defended her roles, citing her predecessor, Mae Schunk, who was active in education throughout the state. Fallout from the I-35W bridge collapse was evident in a January 2008 Minnesota Public Radio/Humphrey Institute poll, with only one in four Minnesotans approving of the job she was doing as Mn/DOT commissioner. State Senator Steve Murphy responded by saying that the Minnesota Senate would remove her if she does not step down from her post as Mn/DOT chief. On February 28, 2008 Molnau was removed from her position as Transportation Commissioner by the State Senate by a party-line, 44–22 vote. Pawlenty considered her ouster a disappointing partisan move while legislators saw failures of leadership and management. === Molnau's farm sale === In addition to the criticism following the I-35W bridge collapse, Molnau was also criticized for the sale of her family's farm in 2000 near a highway improvement project she helped put on a fast track. Then-state Rep. Carol Molnau and her husband Steve Molnau sold a parcel of land for 3.3 million dollars near the Highway 212 project she had backed passed through the House of Representatives. Although the official sale date was May 23, 2000, 8 days after then-governor Jesse Ventura signed the Highway 212 project bill, Molnau stated that the sale had been in negotiations for several months. Additionally, a Carver County clerk stated that the sale date as recorded reflected the actual date of the sale, not the day of the real estate closing or the filing date. ==See also== *List of female lieutenant governors in the United States ==References== *Minnesota Historical Society *Minnesota Legislators Past and present Category:1949 births Category:Living people Category:People from Waconia, Minnesota Category:American people of German descent Category:Members of the Minnesota House of Representatives Category:Lieutenant Governors of Minnesota Category:State cabinet secretaries of Minnesota Category:Minnesota Republicans Category:American Lutherans Category:Women state legislators in Minnesota Category:21st-century American politicians Category:21st-century American women politicians ","title":"Carol Molnau"},{"id":"1284123","text":"Robert Eugene Ladouceur (born July 3, 1954) is a retired American football coach. He began coaching the De La Salle High Spartans in Concord, California in 1979, when he was 25 years old. He took over a program that had never enjoyed a winning season since the school's establishment in 1965. His first season as head coach resulted in their first winning season. His second season resulted in their first appearance in the California Prep Football State Rankings and began De La Salle's evolution into a perennial champion. From 1992 to 2004, he guided the team to 12-consecutive undefeated seasons, setting a national winning streak record for high school football of 151 consecutive wins--a record in US amateur sports matched only by the 159-game winning streak of Passaic High School in men's basketball, and the 459 match win streak of Brandon High School in men's wrestling.

Benson (born January 4, 1943) was the 44th lieutenant governor of Minnesota, serving from January 3, 1995, to January 4, 1999. An Independent Republican, she was elected with Governor Arne Carlson, who had competed for the party endorsement with Allen Quist and Doug McFarland, and defeated DFL nominee John Marty. Benson is a former Minnesota state senator noted for being somewhat more conservative than the moderate Carlson. Benson ran in the 1998 Republican primary for governor, starting off as the front-runner. But despite her attempt to amass enough support within the GOP establishment to ward off any primary challengers, a late entrant to the race, St. Paul Mayor Norm Coleman, garnered enough delegates to win the Republican endorsement at the state convention. Placing third in the race for delegates behind Coleman and Allen Quist, Benson agreed not to challenge Coleman in the primary. He won the nomination but lost the general election to the Reform Party nominee, Jesse Ventura. Upon leaving office in 1999, Benson became the first chief education officer of the Minnesota Business Academy. In that capacity, she worked with civic and state leaders to raise money for the school. Benson was born in Le Sueur, Minnesota, became an educator, and married Robert R. Benson.

It serves as one of two important connecting routes between Interstate 80 and Interstate 5, bypassing Sacramento to the east; the other being Interstate 505 to the west. Past the southern terminus are Collinsville and Birds Landing around the Suisun Bay marshes. Cities along the route include Dixon, Davis, and Woodland. It also shares a stretch of Interstate 80 between just outside UC Davis and Dixon. The section running from Dixon to Woodland is a controlled-access freeway; the remainder is a standard road of two to four lanes. The freeway section spanning from the I-80 interchange (Davis) to Woodland (completed in 1990) is called the Vic Fazio Highway, after the former U.S. House representative of the Davis area, who is credited with obtaining the funding the freeway upgrade of that section. ==Route description== State Route 113 begins at the intersection with State Route 12 between Fairfield and Rio Vista. It heads north on a rural two-lane highway towards the city of Dixon. After heading through the center of the city, it expands to four lanes before reaching Interstate 80. From there, SR 113 is co-routed along I-80, heading northeast towards the city of Davis. SR 113 then splits from I-80 onto its own freeway alignment, heading north near UC Davis. It is the four-lane freeway (known as the Vic Fazio Highway) connecting Interstate 80 in Davis to Interstate 5 in Woodland, thus rivaling Interstate 505 farther west. After leaving Davis, SR 113 continues north through rural areas for a short while, entering Woodland approximately later. Upon reaching I-5, it is co-routed for a short while and splits from I-5 a mile (1.6 km) later. From there, SR 113 leaves Woodland and again heads north on a rural two-lane highway, turning east and north again into the small community of Knights Landing, intersecting with State Route 45. It then heads northeast through the small community of Robbins, then turns east to end at State Route 99 towards Yuba City. SR 113 is part of the California Freeway and Expressway System, and south of the northern city limits of Woodland is part of the National Highway System, a network of highways that are considered essential to the country's economy, defense, and mobility by the Federal Highway Administration. ==Major intersections== ==See also== * ==References== ==External links== *Caltrans: Route 113 road conditions *California Highways: Route 113 *California @ AARoads.com - State Route 94 113 State Route 113 State Route 113 State Route 113 113 Category:U.S. Route 99 Category:Davis, California Category:Woodland, California ","title":"California State Route 113"},{"id":"1284135","text":"Peggy Ann Lautenschlager (November 22, 1955 – March 31, 2018) was an American attorney and politician who was the first chair of the Wisconsin Ethics Commission.Mark Sommerhauser. \\"Ethics Commission chairwoman Peg Lautenschlager resigns\\".

The larger size of a wide area network compared to a local area network requires differences in technology. Wireless networks of different sizes deliver data in the form of telephone calls, web pages, and streaming video. A WWAN often differs from wireless local area network (WLAN) by using mobile telecommunication cellular network technologies such as 2G, 3G, 4G LTE, and 5G to transfer data. It is sometimes referred as Mobile Broadband. These technologies are offered regionally, nationwide, or even globally and are provided by a wireless service provider. WWAN connectivity allows a user with a laptop and a WWAN card to surf the web, check email, or connect to a virtual private network (VPN) from anywhere within the regional boundaries of cellular service. Various computers can have integrated WWAN capabilities. A WWAN may also be a closed network that covers a large geographic area. For example, a mesh network or MANET with nodes on buildings, towers, trucks, and planes could also be considered a WWAN. A WWAN may also be a low-power, low-bit-rate wireless WAN, (LPWAN), intended to carry small packets of information between things, often in the form of battery operated sensors. Since radio communications systems do not provide a physically secure connection path, WWANs typically incorporate encryption and authentication methods to make them more secure. Some of the early GSM encryption techniques were flawed, and security experts have issued warnings that cellular communication, including WWAN, is no longer secure.

He was a Montana rancher and farmer prior entering politics. He attended Montana State College (Later Montana State University) where he wrestled for the Fighting Bobcats and was a two time Big Sky Conference Champion. In 1969, Ohs left his studies in agricultural economics at Montana State University to help the family move to a new ranch in Pony, Montana in a Tobacco Root Mountain valley outside Harrison in Madison County. Ohs was only a few credits short of graduation when he left Montana State.Karl Ohs (Montana Headlines) He stayed on to work the family ranch with his father and his brother, Jerry, and raised his four children, Brad, Eric, Brian and Elizabeth. While serving as Lieutenant Governor, Karl returned to MSU and completed his Bachelor of Science degree in agricultural business in 2004. Accepting his diploma and giving the commencement speech, Ohs said, \\"I promised myself I would be back, but I never thought it would be 40 years.\\" ==Political career== Ohs political involvement was sparked when he attended Willie Nelson's Farm Aid conference in St. Louis in September 1986. Carrying the vital spirit sparked by meeting with farmers and ranchers from all over the United States, Ohs returned home and began searching for ways and means of increasing economic options for Montana agriculture. In 1988, Ohs and nine other Montana ranchers and farmers formed MAGPI, Montana Agricultural Producers, Inc. Ohs served as Chairman of MAGPI, leading the company's exploration of alternative products and alternative markets. For MAGPI, alternative crops had to be accompanied by alternative markets. \\"No sense in growing it if you can't sell it and make a profit,\\" Ohs often said. In 1989 and 1990, Ohs traveled throughout Montana, educating and encouraging farmers to consider canola as a contract crop, much as they did for barley. MAGPI also promoted production of weed seed-free hay, participating in programs to require only weed seed-free hay on US Forest Service and State owned lands: \\"It's win-win all way around: we need to get after our noxious weeds here in Montana and we need to find crops farmers can grow that have a market.\\" Ohs served in the Montana House of Representatives in 1995, 1997, and 1999. During the 1997 and 1999 sessions, he served as Majority Whip. During his time in the Montana State Legislature, Ohs sponsored the legislation that resulted in the purchase, by the state, of the Bovey properties in Virginia City and Nevada City, keeping the history and artifacts of Virginia and Nevada Cities accessible to future generations. Prior to his involvement in state politics, Ohs served 7 years on the Harrison, Montana school board (1978–1984). Running successfully for Lieutenant Governor in 2000 with gubernatorial candidate Judy Martz, Ohs was an active member of the administration, taking a leadership role is resolving complex or controversial issues facing the state including serving as chairman of the Governor's Drought Advisory Committee during drought years and chairing the K-12 Public School Renewal Commission working across party lines to solve the Montana public schools' funding problems. Ohs was best known for his role in peacefully ending the Montana Freeman standoff near Jordan, Montana. In 1996, asked for help by a former ranch hand whose daughter and granddaughter were inside, Ohs served as principal negotiator making 19 separate trips into the Freeman compound. His involvement earned him the 1998 The Louis E. Peters Memorial Service Award given by the FBI for public service.

According to a medical encyclopedia Williams consulted when he was 12, people with cystic fibrosis weren't expected to live past the age of 13. Williams created a string of computer games from 1982 through 1990 for the Atari 8-bit family and then the Amiga which are admired for their imaginative design concepts, innovative sound and music, and skillful implementation. Necromancer is a three-stage game about a wizard growing and controlling an army of trees. Scenarios in Alley Cat include stealthily drinking from the bowls of sleeping dogs, avoiding a sweeping broom to jump inside a fish bowl, and collecting ferns atop a bookcase protected by spiders. Mind Walker, one of the first games released for the Amiga, places the player inside the head of a physics professor gone mad. Late in his career he worked on a licensed title for the Nintendo Entertainment System and another for the Super NES, but became frustrated with the game business and left to attend the Lutheran School of Theology at Chicago and write two theological works. Williams died from cystic fibrosis in 1998, at the age of 37. ==Game design== Bill Williams's first published game was Salmon Run for the Atari 8-bit computers, published by the Atari Program Exchange in 1982. He then authored two titles for Synapse Software: Necromancer (1982) and Alley Cat (1983). Alley Cat was begun by another programmer, John Harris, who abandoned the project. Synapse ported Salmon Run to the VIC-20, publishing it in 1983 under the label Showcase Software. In 1984, Synapse published the stress reduction package Relax, combining a sensor headband and mini-games providing biofeedback. The software was a collaboration between Williams and fellow Synapse game designer Kelly Jones (who wrote the 1983 Atari 8-bit game Drelbs). He then moved to the Amiga, designing and programming Mind Walker (1986), Sinbad and the Throne of the Falcon (1987), and Pioneer Plague (1988). Pioneer Plague was notable as the first Amiga game to make full use of the difficult to work with Hold-And- Modify mode for the in-game graphics. His final game for the platform was Knights of the Crystallion (1990): For almost all of these Atari 8-bit and Amiga titles, Williams did the design and programming, created the art and sound effects, and composed the music. The credits often read, simply, \\"by Bill Williams.\\" Near the end of his game development career he worked on Monopoly for the Nintendo Entertainment System and Bart's Nightmare for Super NES. Both games were for Sculptured Software in Salt Lake City, Utah, though Williams worked out of his home. Company meddling during the development of the last game prompted Williams to abandon the video game industry completely, calling the experience \\"Bill's Nightmare\\". Some Super Nintendo sound driver code written by Williams during this time was used in other games. ==Writing== Williams wrote the book, Naked Before God: The Return of a Broken Disciple, published by Morehouse Publishing in May, 1998 and in paperback in 2001. It imagines himself as a disciple of Jesus with cystic fibrosis in the present day, trying to understand his struggles with CF and diabetes, and Jesus's message. A collection of poetry and short prose, Manna in the Wilderness: A Harvest of Hope, illustrated by his wife Martha Williams, was published posthumously in March 1999. ==Death== Bill had been born with the genetic disorder cystic fibrosis, which affected his lungs and impaired his ability to breathe. In 1992, he moved to Chicago to study at the Lutheran School of Theology at Chicago, but the city's air pollution worsened his condition significantly, and he had to drop out after two years with only half of the program completed. He moved to Rockport, Texas, but his health continued to deteriorate until he died of complications from the disorder on May 28, 1998, one day before his 38th birthday. ==References== ==External links== * Essay on Bill Williams's game development career which also explores Necromancer Category:1960 births Category:1998 deaths Category:Deaths from cystic fibrosis Category:Disease-related deaths in Texas Category:American video game designers Category:Video game programmers Category:20th-century American writers Category:20th-century American male writers ","title":"Bill Williams (game designer)"},{"id":"1284182","text":"Rockingham County Public Schools is the public school district in Rockingham County in the U.S. state of Virginia. ==General information== * RCPS has received nearly $2 million in 21st Century Community Learning Centers grants from the U.S. and VA Depts. of Education to operate before- and after-school programs at five elementary schools in cooperation with Boys & Girls Clubs of Harrisonburg and Rockingham County. * The four high schools offer students a variety of opportunities to earn college credit while in high school, including dual enrollment classes, as well as Advanced Placement (AP) classes in all major content areas. * Al high schools offer alternative education programs for at-risk students. * All high schools have multi-purpose computer labs that remain open to students until 5:30 p.m., Monday through Thursday, during the school year. * A Smaller Learning Communities grant for $300,000 was received from the U.S. Dept. of Education to improve programs such as middle to high school transition. * The Character Counts program has been implemented in all elementary, middle and high schools. * RCPS has over 4,000 computers, which are deployed in every classroom, office, library, and computer lab.

Dynasts who marry against the express prohibition of the monarch and the Cortes are excluded from the succession together with their descendants.1978 constitution, article 57(4) A prohibition expressed only by the monarch or only by the Cortes will have no consequences to the succession. Disputes about the succession are to be settled by legislation. Upon succeeding to the throne, the monarch is required by article 61(1) of the 1978 constitution to take an oath on the occasion of his being proclaimed before the Cortes Generales. == Line of succession == *15px King Juan Carlos I (born 1938) **15px King Felipe VI (b. 1968) *** (1) Leonor, Princess of Asturias (b. 2005) *** (2) Infanta Sofía (b. 2007) ** (3) Infanta Elena, Duchess of Lugo (b. 1963) *** (4) Felipe de Marichalar y Borbón (b. 1998) *** (5) Victoria de Marichalar y Borbón (b. 2000) ** (6) Infanta Cristina (b. 1965) *** (7) Juan Urdangarin y de Borbón (b. 1999) *** (8) Pablo Urdangarin y de Borbón (b. 2000) *** (9) Miguel Urdangarin y de Borbón (b. 2002) *** (10) Irene Urdangarin y de Borbón (b. 2005) The historical list of potential successors with dynastic rights was much longer, but the Spanish Constitution of 1978 (art. 57.1) limits the line of succession to descendants of King Juan Carlos I. ==Succession uncertainties== thumb Section 1 of Article 57 of the Spanish Constitution of 1978 provides that \\"The Crown of Spain shall be inherited by the successors of H. M. Juan Carlos I de Borbón.\\"\\"La Corona de España es hereditaria en los sucesores de S. M. Don Juan Carlos I de Borbón, legítimo heredero de la dinastía histórica...\\" To date, no clarification has been made whether this provision includes anyone beyond the descendants of King Juan Carlos: \\"Successors\\" may not be presumed to be synonymous with \\"descendants\\". King Juan Carlos's two sisters renounced their rights of succession, but those renunciations took place before the adoption of the Constitution. The rights of earlier generations are similarly clouded by numerous renunciations and unapproved marriages which may or may not exclude the individuals involved from the throne. Article 57 further provides that \\"Abdications and renunciations and any doubt in fact or in law that may arise in connection with the succession to the Crown shall be settled by an organic act.\\" Article 57 further states that \\"Should all the lines designated by law become extinct, the Cortes Generales shall provide for succession to the Crown in the manner most suitable for the interests of Spain.\\" Unless and until an organic act clarifies the rights of other members of the King's family, it is unknown who, if anyone, follows Infanta Cristina's descendants in the line of succession. ===Possible interpretations=== *The Congress of Deputies in the Cortes Generales has the constitutional responsibility to clarify the succession when doubt arises. If the word \\"successors\\" is deemed to mean \\"descendants\\", the line ends with Irene Urdangarin y de Borbón. * If not, then: **If renunciations made by King Juan Carlos's sisters are not deemed valid, Infanta Cristina's descendants are followed by the heirs of Duchess of Badajoz and the Duchess of Soria and her descendants. **If renunciations made by King Juan Carlos's sisters are deemed valid, then the heirs of Infante Carlos, Duke of Calabria, follow Infanta Cristina's descendants in the line of succession. ==Planned absolute primogeniture== In its 2004 election manifesto, the victorious Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE) included plans to adopt absolute primogeniture, a proposal which was supported by the leader of the main opposition party, the conservative People's Party. It was initially thought that the change would only apply to future generations but with all the major political parties in agreement that the system of male-preference primogeniture conflicts with the constitutionally established principle of gender equality, it was planned that the law would be changed before the Princess of Asturias bore a son, thereby demoting Infanta Leonor in the line succession. The subsequent announcement, in 2006, that the Princess was pregnant with a second daughter, however, removed any immediate urgency in the passage of the necessary legislation. ==References and notes== Navarro i Soriano, Ferran (2019).

He has composed scores for films such as The Transformers: The Movie, Staying Alive and Rocky IV soundtracks. DiCola also pioneered the use of sequencers on his soundtrack recording for Rocky IV, one of the first to exploit the Fairlight CMI and Synclavier II's computer's sequencing capabilities. ==Life and career== DiCola was born in 1957 in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, to Italian-American parents. After majoring in percussion in college, DiCola began his professional music career upon moving to California in 1981. One of his early credits as a session musician was his synthesizer performance on Juice Newton's albums Dirty Looks and Old Flame released in 1983 and 1985, respectively. His first major break came when he was chosen to co-write several songs on the Staying Alive soundtrack (1983) with Frank Stallone.[ AllMusic.com Music Bio] Following his work on the Staying Alive project, he was recruited by Sylvester Stallone to write the original score for Rocky IV (1985), followed by scoring The Transformers: The Movie (1986). Since then, he has been active in the capacity of producer, recorded and performed as both a solo artist and member of several bands, and continues to work as a session musician and contributor to film soundtracks as composer and performer. DiCola counts Yes and Emerson, Lake & Palmer among his biggest influences in progressive rock music. He also admires film-music composers Thomas Newman, John Powell and Jerry Goldsmith. ==Awards== In 1983, DiCola was a co-nominee for the Best Album of Original Score Written for a Motion Picture or Television Special Grammy for co-writing the soundtrack of the movie Staying Alive, in spite of the poor critical reception of the film. He also received a Golden Globe nomination for Best Original Song – Motion Picture for the song \\"Far from Over\\", which he co-wrote with Frank Stallone for the same film. At the time, critics didn't appreciate his usage of electronic music in the Rocky IV soundtrack and he received a Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Musical Score as a result.IMDB: Awards for Vince DiCola But on a more positive note, the song \\"The Touch\\" from the Transformers soundtrack won DiCola a 1986 Apex award for Best Original Song – Fantasy/Science Fiction/Horror. ==Transformers== DiCola has had enough of a cult following amongst Transformers fans to have warranted the release of several albums of music related to the Transformers movie, as follow-ups to the release of the original 1986 The Transformers: The Movie soundtrack. First released as a BotCon'97 exclusive, the 2-CD set Til All Are One contains the first full score of the movie. BotCon 2001 saw the releases of The Protoform Sessions (featuring demos and rarities and including extended commentary from DiCola) and Artistic Transformations: Themes and Variations, containing solo piano renditions of songs from the soundtrack, as well as another complete score on a single disc named Lighting Their Darkest Hour. He has been a guest at multiple Transformers conventions, including appearances at BotCon'97, BotCon'98, BotCon 2000 and The Official Transformers Collectors' Convention 2004 in Rosemont, Illinois.Information on Vince DiCola @AnimeCons at YOJOE.COM An interview with DiCola was included on the Region 1 DVD release of The Transformers: The Movie released by Rhino Entertainment in the year 2000. However, this interview is not present on the 20th Anniversary Edition released by Sony and BMG in 2006. DiCola credits his work on Transformers with getting his music exposed to a much wider audience and getting him the most attention and fame he has had as an artist. ==Solo works== DiCola released his first solo work in 1986, an album simply titled Piano Solos. He later worked both as an arranger and performer on a 1991 multi-artist project called Artfully Beatles, which led him to release Artistically Beatles, an album of ten Beatles songs he arranged and performed, in 1993. An additional solo album called Falling Off a Clef was released in 2004. In the same year, he completed the soundtrack to the low-rated 2004 film Sci-Fighter, collaborating with the composer Kenny Meriedeth in October 2003, using Kenny's synthesizer and sound banks. The album Falling Off a Clef contains six new tracks (Castle of the Gods suite, Alien March, Fallen Angel, FS#7, A. P.B., Castle of the Gods Variation) + a selection of 20 tracks from Sci-Fighter soundtrack. ==Other works== In addition to his solo work, DiCola has worked with various musical groups. In 1991–1992 he began working with the 5-piece rock band Storming Heaven, releasing the album Life in Paradise in 1996. In addition to DiCola on keyboards, guitar and vocals, the Storming Heaven lineup included lead vocalist Rick Livingston, Jethro Tull drummer Doane Perry, guitarist Curtis Taylor, and keyboardist Casey Young. Life in Paradise was written during 1991. The band was originally formed in January 1991. They spent the first half of the year creating the start of a musical suite entitled \\"Jessie's Journey\\", an idea that later was abandoned in favor of individual songs. \\"It was supposed to be an entire album based on a kind of science fiction theme. Those first four songs (\\"Cross the Line\\", \\"Red Knight\\", \\"The Passage\\" and \\"Dream House\\"), they're sort of like the opening four songs of a suite.\\" Around the same time in 1996, DiCola, Storming Heaven bandmate Doane Perry, and Tower of Power vocalist Ellis Hall formed a soul/progressive-rock trio named Thread and released their one and only self-titled album on CD. In 1999, he recorded experimental and largely improvisational instrumental tracks under the name of The Firing Squad. These recordings remain officially unreleased but several tracks have been posted on YouTube. In 2001, he worked again with Perry and released In-VINCE-ible!, a collection of diverse works from various past projects, with ex-members of Santana and Chicago assisting as session musicians, and featuring several special guests including Steve Walsh of Kansas and his Storming Heaven bandmates.In-VINCE-ible Album Review DiCola appeared as keyboardist on the first Hughes Turner Project album HTP in 2003. He and Perry once again formed a trio, this time with bassist Paul Ill and called DPI, to release a 3-track EP called Found Objects in 2006. Previously the trio had worked with vocalist Vincent Kendall and guitarist Reeves Gabrels in releasing a 42-minute suite called \\"Pity the Rich\\" based on recordings made at the same time. The jam-session style recordings for these releases were originally intended to be part of a new DiCola solo instrumental release, but while editing the tracks in his home studio DiCola felt they had the feel of a project for a band and chose to expand his original plan to include the other performers. In 2007, \\"Paulie's Robot\\" from Rocky IV was used in the episode of Family Guy, \\"Movin' Out\\", and in 2010, \\"Training Montage\\", also from the Rocky IV soundtrack, was used in the episode \\"Something, Something, Something, Dark Side\\". In 2008, he was featured on the Gran Turismo 5 Prologue Original Soundtrack and was responsible for arranging the series theme, \\"Moon Over the Castle\\" (with the guitarist Doug Bossi) as well as another piece titled \\"Truth\\". Both titles were written by the Japanese Band T-Square with which Vince worked on the album Truth 21c (2001, with Takeshi Itoh, as T-Square Plus). He described his work on the Gran Turismo's soundtrack's project in an interview with Music4Games, noting that he collaborated with T-Square and Doug Bossi on the project, and looks forward to becoming involved with game music in the future. In 2009, he composed the song \\"Bound and Gagged\\" as a submission for the upcoming Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen. The track featured DiCola on keyboards and drums, Kenny Meriedeth on guitars, and Rick Livingstone on vocals but was not selected by Michael Bay for the Transformers II soundtrack. In 2011, he began composing music for the video game Saturday Morning RPG from Mighty Rabbit Studios. The game released on the iTunes App Store in March 2012. In 2012, DiCola recorded the official theme for Chikara's King of Trios professional wrestling event, alongside Kenny Meriedeth. In 2013, DiCola released a Christmas medley that was featured as a part of the Saturday Morning RPG soundtrack ahead of a planned full soundtrack release for the game. In 2014, DiCola along with Kenny Meriedeth, wrote the music for Angry Birds Transformers for Rovio. DiCola also wrote original music for the video game Transformers: Devastation. In 2016 DiCola also Alongside Meriedeth wrote original music for the video game Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutants in Manhattan. In 2019 DiCola features on the song \\"This Isn't Love\\" from the album 'Exhibits' by the rock band Work Of Art.

The fort was named after Col. and later General Stephen Watts Kearny. The outpost was located along the Oregon Trail near Kearney, Nebraska. The town of Kearney took its name from the fort. The \\"e\\" was added to Kearny by postmen who consistently misspelled the town name. A portion of the original site is preserved as Fort Kearny State Historical Park by the Nebraska Game and Parks Commission. The fort became the eastern anchor of the Great Platte River Road and thus an important military and civilian way station for 20 years. Wagon trains moving west, were able to resupply after completing about a sixth (16%) of the journey. The fort offered a safe resting area for the eastern immigrants in this new and hostile land. Livestock could be traded for fresh stock and letters sent back to the States. The fort continued to expand over the years, until there were over 30 buildings before its closure in 1871. It took on additional roles as a Pony Express station, an Overland Stage station and a telegraph station.Comprehensive Management and Use Plan, Oregon National Historic Trail, Appendix III; Selected Historic Sites and Cross-Country Segments, Status and Recommendations; National Park Service, United States Department of the Interior; Washington, D.C.; August 1981; page 69-70 ==Origins and various missions of the fort== The fort was built in response to the growth of overland emigration to Oregon after 1845. The first post, Fort Kearny, was established in the spring of 1848 \\"near the head of the Grand Island\\" along the Platte River by Lieutenant Daniel P. Woodbury. It was first called Fort Chiles,Letter datelined \\"Nebraska Territory May 26th 1849\\" to Chillicothe, Illinois, entered the mails with \\"Fort Leavenworth, Mo./June 14\\" datestamp, Spink Shreves Galleries, https://stampauctionnetwork.com/f/f12122.cfm, last accessed January 14, 2019: \\"\\"...wee are within Ten miles of fort Kerney formerly called fort Chiles…\\" named for Col. Joseph Chiles. but in 1848 the post was renamed Fort Kearny in honor of General Stephen Watts Kearny. Despite its lack of fortifications, Fort Kearny served as way station, sentinel post, supply depot, and message center for 49'ers bound for California and homeseekers traveling to California, Oregon and the Pacific Northwest. The earliest surviving photograph of the post, taken in 1858 by Samuel C. Mills, shows the post as a collection of adobe buildings without any wall or fortifications. By the 1860s the fort had become a significant state and freighting station and home station of the Pony Express. During the Indian Wars of 1864-1865 a small stockade was apparently built upon the earth embankment still visible. Although never under attack, the post did serve as an outfitting depot for several Indian campaigns. The fort was a precious source of provisions for emigrants on the early section of the trail for several decades during the height of the trail use until its abandonment in 1871. As it had been founded along the Platte River to protect emigrants on the trail westward, the fort became an important stop along the eastern part of the trail for the following decade, offering the sale of food, reliable mail service and other amenities. At the height of the pioneer trail use in the 1850s, as many as 2,000 emigrants and 10,000 oxen might pass through in a single day during the height of the trail season in late May. One of the fort's final duties was the protection of workers building the Union Pacific. In 1871, two years after the completion of the transcontinental railroad, the fort was discontinued as a military post. Its buildings were disassembled and moved West to outfit newer posts. ==Description== The fort was intended mostly as a supply post, and not as defensive position in the Indian Wars. Throughout most of its history, the fort consisted mostly of wooden buildings surrounding a central parade ground without fortified walls. Throughout the decades of its use until the completion of the transcontinental railroad, the character of the buildings became slightly more permanent, changing from adobe and sod structures to wooden frame construction. Although it was in the heart of area inhabited by American Indians aka Native Americans, and was near the center of hostile action in the 1860s, no direct attack was ever made on the fort. ==History== ===First Fort Kearny=== The fort along the Platte River was the second of two army posts in present-day Nebraska to be named after Colonel Stephen W. Kearny of the U.S. Army. In 1838, Kearny had scouted the area along the Missouri River at the mouth of Table Creek near present-day Nebraska City looking for a suitable location for an outpost to protect westward travelers. In 1846, following Kearny's recommendation, the United States War Department had ordered the building of an outpost on the site and directed Kearny to construct one there. The Army then sent Colonel Kearny with a detachment of men from Fort Leavenworth up the Missouri to the area with orders to construct an outpost at the selected site.Old Fort Kearny; Otoe County Historical Society, Historical Land Mark Council; East Central Avenue, Nebraska City; Otoe County, Marker 36; Nebraska Dept of Transportation; Lincoln, Nebraska; obtained 2016 The Army constructed a two-story wooden blockhouse on the site, which became known as Camp Kearny and later Fort Kearny. The Army quickly realized, however, the location was not chosen well, since few emigrants passed the site on their way west. Instead, the main routes of the trails preferred by emigrants lay to the north near Omaha and to the south. Construction was subsequently halted on the site, with the exception of the erection of a number of log huts for temporary quarters for a battalion of troops who wintered there in 1847-1848\\\\. ===Second Fort Kearny=== In September 1847, Kearny sent topographical engineer Lt. Daniel P. Woodbury westward along the Platte looking for a more suitable location for the outpost. Woodbury selected a site in present-day central Nebraska near the spot where the Trail westward from Independence, Missouri joined the trail westward from Omaha and Council Bluffs. Woodbury described the spot in his journals as: :I have located the post opposite a group of wooded islands in the Platte River ... three hundred seventeen miles from Independence, Missouri, one hundred seventeen miles from Fort Kearny on the Missouri and three miles from the head of the group of islands called Grand Island. In December Woodbury went to Washington, D.C. with orders to secure organization of the new post. Woodbury requested an appropriation of $15,000 for construction, while advocating the employment of Mormon emigrants for construction. Although he did not receive these provisions, Woodbury received permission to build the fort from scratch with soldier labor. The Army abandoned the Table Creek post in May 1848 and arrived at the new site in June. Woodbury directed construction of the fort with 175 men as labor. They built wooden buildings around a four-acre (16,000 m²) parade ground, with cottonwood trees planted around the perimeter. Woodbury initially named the fort \\"Fort Childs\\" after Col. Thomas Childs, a famous soldier in the Mexican–American War, as well as Woodbury's father-in- law. A directive from War Department, however, directed that the name \\"Fort Kearny\\" would be transferred to the new fort.The National Survey of Historic Sites and Buildings, Volume XII; Soldiers and Braves, Historic Places Associated with Indian Affairs and the Indian Wars in the Trans-Mississippi West, Robert G. Ferris (Ed), United States Department of the Interior, NPS, Washington, D.C. 1971 pg 206–07 The fort grew rapidly into an important trail stop. By June 1849, Woodbury noted in his journals that 4,000 wagons had passed the fort so far that year, mostly on their way to California. The fort accumulated large stores of goods for travelers, with the directive of selling them at a beneficial cost to the emigrants. Specifically, the commander of the fort was authorized to sell goods at cost to emigrants, and in some cases of hardship, to give goods to them for free. In 1850, the fort acquired regular once-a-month mail service with the arrival of a stagecoach route between Independence, Missouri and Salt Lake City. It was the first regular mail service established along the trail. ==Trail Junction== Fort Kearny's location was chosen based on its proximity to the junction of several existing smaller trails, which joined together into a single broader route that became known as the Great Platte River Road. At this location, immigrant trains from the Missouri River trail head converged and thousands of overland travelers passed by the fort each year. The Armies two functions included protection and aid to the thousands of emigrants moving westward and to protect the Indian tribes from the migrants and from other tribes. Over time, road ranches grew up nearby. Dobytown became the first settlement providing supplies and entertainment to the emigrants and the soldiers.Kearney-Fort Kearny: Department of Roads; Nebraska State Historical Society, Kearny Rest Area, I-80 E, Buffalo County; Marker 200 *Eastern Trailsheads **Westport near Kansas City, used by most emigrants. **Fort Leavenworth ** St. Joseph, Missouri ** Nebraska City became a major freight center during The Mormon War and after the discovery of gold in the Colorado and Montana Territories (1858-1865).

By Samuel C. Mills, photographer with the Simpson Expedition The early years of the fort were relatively peaceful. After 1854, and the creation of the Nebraska Territory by the Kansas–Nebraska Act, the area around the fort in northern Kansas and southern Nebraska increasingly came under the hostile activity of the Cheyenne and Sioux tribes. In the summer of 1864, the irritation of the Native Americans at the encroachment by white settlers culminated in violent attacks on wagon trains along the Platte and the Little Blue River. During this time, soldiers from the fort began escorting wagon trains, and the fort became a center for refugees fleeing from attacks. Earthwork fortifications were constructed at the fort, and the Army ordered the deployment of the First Nebraska Cavalry and the Seventh Iowa Cavalry to the fort. By 1865, the conflict between Native Americans and white settlers had shifted westward away from the area of the fort. ==Later years and abandonment== The construction of the Union Pacific Railroad across Nebraska starting in 1865 largely marked the end of the need for a fort to protect and supply wagon train emigrants. Following the completion of the transcontinental railroad in 1869, the U.S. Army issued an order for abandonment of the post on May 22, 1871. In 1875, the buildings were torn down and the materials removed to barracks at North Platte and Sidney. The troops of the fort were restationed to Omaha and its stores were relocated to Fort McPherson 70 miles (110 km) to the west. In December 1876, the grounds were given over to the United States Department of the Interior for disbursement to settlements under the Homestead Act. Within several years, little remained of the fort except for cottonwood trees and the 1864 earthwork fortifications.Fort Kearny; Nebraska Game and Parks Commission, Nebraska State Historical Society, Fort Kearny State Historical Society; Kearny County, Marker 229; Nebraska Dept of Transportation; Lincoln, NE, obtained 2016 ==Fort Kearny State Historical Park== In 1928, the Fort Kearny Memorial Association was formed by Nebraska citizens to raise money to purchase and restore part of the grounds. The organization was able to purchase of the original site, which it offered to the State of Nebraska. The State Legislature authorized the purchase, which became final on March 26, 1929. Thus acquired by the State of Nebraska in 1929, part of the original site is now operated as Fort Kearny State Historical Park by the Nebraska Game and Parks Commission. The site has been entered on the National Register of Historic Places. In cooperation with the Nebraska Game and Parks Commission, which operates the current State Historic Park, the Nebraska State Historical Society conducts ongoing archaeological investigations of the grounds. These digs have uncovered and marked the foundations of all major building on the site including headquarters, officers and troops quarters, parade grounds, storage and livestock stockade. A small theatre that shows a 20-minute history of the fort, a museum with collected artifacts and a reconstructed blacksmith shop with period cannons, caissons, tack and other equipment is behind the museum. There is space on the park for RV and trailer parking with some facilities. The park is only open during the summer months. Reenactors fire the authentic cannon every year on 4 July weekend ceremonies. In June 2010, Governor Dave Heineman signed a Proclamation re-establishing the 2nd Battalion, Nebraska Veteran Cavalry, the unit will be at the Fort on three major holidays, memorial day weekend, 4 July weekend, and Labor day weekend. This historical cavalry unit served at the fort during the Indian Wars, the unit is historically correct in every possible aspect; bugle calls used by the cavalry can be heard at differing times to announce the activities of the troop at the fort. ==Depiction in fiction== In the novel Around the World in Eighty Days by Jules Verne, a train in the process of being hijacked by Sioux stops at Fort Kearny to request aid from the troops there. Such an event is somewhat of an anachronism, given that the conflicts with Native Americans had largely shifted away from the area by the time of the completion of the railroad. The fort is prominently mentioned and described as a stop along the Oregon Trail in 1855 in the novel \\"Westward Hearts (Homeward on the Oregon Trail Book 1)\\" by Melody Carlson, 2012 chapter 25. Fort Kearny also appears in the short-lived television western drama series The Loner starring actor Lloyd Bridges. The series, created and written by Rod Serling of \\"The Twilight Zone\\" fame, takes place in the late 1860s and features the fort in an episode titled \\"Westward the Shoemaker\\". The \\"Westward...\\" episode concerns an Eastern European Jewish immigrant who seeks a new life in Nebraska Territory as a bootmaker but runs afoul of a card shark. The fort is mentioned in the introduction to an episode of the TV series Wagon Train, \\"The Willy Moran Story\\" as the next destination of the settlers. The fort is also referenced in the HBO television series Deadwood in episode 5 of the first series as the closest place to find smallpox vaccine. The fort is mentioned in the 2014 film The Homesman, as the post Tommy Lee Jones character was stationed when a soldier with the U.S. Dragoons. The fort is a stop in the Oregon Trail video game. ==See also== * Dobytown, Nebraska * Fort Phil Kearny * Mormon Trail * Landmarks of the Nebraska Territory * Pony Express ==References== ==Further reading== *Barnes, Jeff.

It evolved between the late 1940s and late 1960s, in Kenya's capital city of Nairobi. In the 1940s, the African Broadcasting Service in Nairobi aired a steady stream of soukous, South African kwela, Congolese finger-style guitar and various kinds of Cuban dance music that heavily influenced emergence of benga. There were also popular folk songs of Kenya's Luo peoples that formed the base on benga creation. == Luo Benga == The Luo of Kenya have long played an eight-string lyre called nyatiti, and guitarists from the area sought to imitate the instrument's syncopated melodies. In benga, the electric bass guitar is played in a style reminiscent of the nyatiti. As late as the turn of the twentieth century, this bass in nyatiti supported the rhythm essential in transmitting knowledge about the society through music. Opondo Owenga of Gem Yala, the grandfather of Odhiambo Siangla, was known in employing music as a means of teaching history of the Luo. The father of the popular Luo Benga is non other than The Famous George Ramogi (Omogi Wuod Weta) and CK Jazz. He helped the Benga enthusiasts by recording their Benga music in different labels in the capital city Nairobi. Dr. Mengo of Victoria Jazz was a protege of George Ramogi. In 1967, the first major benga band, Shirati Jazz, was formed by Daniel Owino Misiani. The group launched a string of hits that were East Africa's biggest songs throughout the 1970s and 1980s. Shirati Jazz's biggest rival was Victoria Jazz, formed in 1972 by Ochieng Nelly Mengo and Collela Mazee. Despite many personnel changes, Victoria Jazz remained popular throughout the 1970s, when the Voice of Kenya radio station pushed an onslaught of East African pop. Victoria C Band of Awino Lawi was one of the splinter group of Victoria Jazz. 1997 saw the death of three prominent Luo Benga artist, Okatch Biggy of Heka Heka Band, George Ramogi and Prince Jully. The Jolly Boys Band of Prince Jully was taken over by his wife Princess Jully and she has since been a leading female Benga musician. Another famous benga band Migori Super Stars was formed in the mid 70s and was led by Musa Olwete which later split to form another popular benga band Migori Super Stars C with musicians such as Joseph Ochola (Kasongo Polo Menyo), Onyango Jamba, Ochieng' Denge denge and others. More modern benga artists include Kapere Jazz Band and the rootsy Ogwang Lelo Okoth. The new millennium has seen emergence of Dola Kabarry and Musa Juma. The latter saw his career cut short as he died in 2011. MJ, as he was popularly known to his fans, developed a kind of benga that infused elements of rumba. he was able to mold other musicians such as John Junior, Ogonji, Madanji, and his late brother Omondi Tonny.Daily Nation, March 16, 2011: Benga maestro leaves fans wailing for more There are also other benga artists based in other countries other than Kenya, such as the American/Kenyan group Extra Golden. ==See also== * Chandarana Records ==References== Category:Kenyan styles of music Category:African popular music ","title":"Benga music"},{"id":"1284285","text":"Venture Stores, Inc. was a chain of retail stores aimed at the discount department store market. John Geisse, formerly of Target Stores, and May Department Stores Executive Vice President Dave Babcock founded the chain in 1968. Venture Stores expanded to operate over 70 stores with major market share in St. Louis, Chicago, and Kansas City, and expanded across various areas in the United States over a period of nearly 30 years, becoming the largest discount chain in Chicago. In January 1998, Venture Stores entered a Chapter 11 bankruptcy and closed within six months. ==History== The chain was founded in 1968 when Target founder John F. Geisse went to work for May Department Stores. Under an antitrust settlement reached with the Department of Justice, May was unable to acquire any more retail chains at the time, and the department store company needed a way to compete against the emerging discount store chains. When May's Executive Vice President Dave Babcock learned that Geisse had resigned from Target Stores, he spoke with Geisse about starting a new discount retailer, resulting in the founding of Venture. The first Venture store opened in 1970 in the St. Louis suburb of Overland. In 1976, Geisse retired and left Venture Stores, which had by that time expanded to 20 units. In 1978, Venture Stores purchased 23 Turn Style locations in the Chicago area from Jewel food stores, and expanded to over 40 locations in the Chicago market area, with many city locations. It was the largest discount chain in Chicago with inner-city locations other than Zayre/Ames. In 1990, Venture separated from May and became a private corporation. Venture's advertising slogan during the 1980s was \\"Save at Venture, Save With Style.\\" or \\"SWS\\". In the 1990s, Venture would employ two other slogans; the first, tied to a companywide remodeling initiative aimed at making the stores more like Kohl's, was \\"See What's New For You!\\". At the time Venture closed, the slogan was \\"See What A Little Money Can Buy.\\" ==Dining== As was a common trend in American department stores, many Venture stores offered a dining area inside the store, typically called Cafe Venture. This area would sell standard American fare, such as hamburgers & pizza, although one could also get a \\"hot dog with the ends cut off.\\" The dining area also contained a second area that sold popcorn, pretzels, and Icee drinks. ==Bankruptcy== Sign for the Venture store in Davenport, Iowa, in 1998 By the late 1990s, the chain found that it was unable to compete against other retail chains, such as Kmart, Target, and Wal-Mart. Venture tried to return to its founding principles as an upscale discounter and remodeled most of its 90+ stores. While facing vast competition Venture made a fatal mistake trying to expand into Texas instead of protecting its core markets. Venture sold the Texas stores to Kmart in 1996 and closed its distribution center in Corsicana, Texas. The company entered Chapter 11 bankruptcy on January 20, 1998, and tried to operate with a smaller number of stores. The effort was not successful, and the company announced its closing on April 27, 1998. Liquidation of store inventory continued through July 1998 Most of the former Venture buildings were absorbed into other chains, primarily Kmart (for their new Big Kmart stores at the time),, the final of which was located in Crystal City, Missouri, which closed permanently in March 2019. Others were absorbed by Kohl's, ShopKo, and Burlington Coat Factory. ==References== ==External links== *Television commercials at The Museum of Classic Chicago Television Category:Retail companies established in 1970 Category:Companies based in St. Louis County, Missouri Category:Defunct discount stores of the United States Category:Defunct retail companies of the United States Category:Retail companies disestablished in 1998 Category:1970 establishments in Missouri Category:1998 disestablishments in Missouri ","title":"Venture Stores"},{"id":"1284289","text":"frame Antiwar.com is a website which describes itself as devoted to \\"non- interventionism\\" and as opposing imperialism and war.

Per Who's Who in Ridgefield (CT), he was considered such a \\"hellion\\" that his father sent the 11-year-old to an English boarding school for disciplining. At 16, he moved to New York, studying at City College and Columbia and, in 1946, went to work at the Cotton Exchange, earning $15 a week. Other accounts say that he immigrated to the United States in 1942 and served in the U.S. Army Air Forces. Details of his upbringing are unknown but Vanity Fair reported that: \\"Truth be told, Charlie wasn't elucidative about a lot of things, including whether he was Jewish, which he kept Hollywood guessing about by posting a sentry outside the men's room door. (That, at least, can be settled here: Not Cut, according to a movieland wife with opportunity for close observation.)\\" Three years later, he formed a company that would make him a millionaire at 30; in 1956, he acquired Michigan Bumper, a small auto parts company that eventually grew into Gulf and Western Industries, a conglomerate that ranked 61st in the Fortune 500 by 1981. And according to Robert Evans, in 1970 Bluhdorn had told him: \\"Imagine, twelve years ago I was walking the streets selling typewriters door to door.\\" Charles married Yvette M. LeMarrec, formerly of Paris, about 1950. Subholdings of Gulf and Western were blue-chip names such as Paramount Pictures (acquired in 1966), Madison Square Garden, and Simon & Schuster publishing as well as less glamorous holdings such as mining, New Jersey Zinc Company. Paramount was suggested to Bluhdorn by Sumner Redstone and the acquisition was encouraged by Paramount's head of publicity, Martin Davis.Bart, Peter. \\"Infamous Players: A Tale of Movies, the Mob (and Sex)\\" NY: Weinstein Books, 2011 It was during Gulf and Western's ownership of Paramount that it went from being number nine at the box office, based upon total receipt sales, to number 1 with such hits as The Godfather and Chinatown. In 1974 he hired Barry Diller as Paramount's chairman and chief executive, making Diller, at age 32, the youngest studio chief in history and the first to come from the TV business. Bluhdorn was known to be a tireless executive once dubbed \\"The Mad Austrian of Wall Street.\\" He maintained his position as chairman of Gulf and Western Industries until his death. He was also infamous (and widely imitated) for his cement-thick Austro-German accent, which has been lampooned in interviews by former collaborators such as Francis Ford Coppola and Robert Evans. He died of a heart attack on his private jet while returning to the United States from his Casa de Campo resort in the Dominican Republic. His private funeral services were held at St. Mary's Church in Ridgefield, Connecticut. Among those who attended was friend and former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger. At Tufts University in Boston, there is the Charles G. Bluhdorn Prize in Economics, awarded annually to an undergraduate majoring in economics who has demonstrated outstanding scholastic ability. This prize was founded in 1983 by Donald Gaston in memory of Charles G. Bluhdorn. Bluhdorn's tumultuous relationship with appointed Paramount executive Robert Evans was documented in Evans's 1994 biographical book The Kid Stays in the Picture and in the 2002 film of the same title. Bluhdorn initially hired Evans in 1966 to head European production for Paramount Pictures. He would promote Evans almost immediately to head of production at Paramount Pictures. The 1990 film The Godfather Part III was dedicated to Bluhdorn, \\"who inspired it.\\" ==Dominican Republic== Charles Bluhdorn was very passionate about his projects in this country. He invested a lot of resources into its social and economic development. Bluhdorn is credited as being the father of the Dominican tourism industry. In 1967 Gulf+Western paid $54 million for South Puerto Rico Sugar Company. Most of the company's operations were in the Dominican Republic, where it owned the extensive Central Romana sugar mill in La Romana and of land. Nearly half of the land was used to produce sugar cane and, at the peak of the cane-cutting season, the company employed 19,000 people, making it the country's largest private employer as well as the largest taxpayer and landowner. Gulf+Western acquired Consolidated Cigar in 1968 and shifted the Canary Island cigar-making operation to La Romana. As Gulf+Western had purchased Paramount in 1966, Bluhdorn had plans to turn the island into a moviemaking mecca. For that purpose he constantly invited producers, directors, writers and movie stars so they could appreciate the natural beauty of the country. * Godfather Part II (1974) – the scenes that took place in Cuba were shot in Santo Domingo. * Sorcerer (1977) – produced under rugged conditions in the jungles of the Dominican Republic * Apocalypse Now (1979) – some scenes were filmed on the Chavón River In 1975 Gulf+Western developed of the sugar mill's land into the Casa de Campo resort. Casa de Campo is home to three internationally renowned golf courses designed by Pete Dye – Teeth of the Dog, Dye Fore and Links. One of Bluhdorn's Dominican friends, Oscar de la Renta, was hired to do interior design for Casa De Campo and licensed his men's wear line through Kayser-Roth. Kayser-Roth (a division of Gulf+Western), owned the Miss Universe pageant via its acquisition of Pacific Mills. Pacific Mills had invented the pageant to sell its Catalina Swimwear brand. Miss Universe 1977 was held in the Dominican Republic in order to promote tourism to this island. Former Paramount Studios set designer Roberto Copa designed the artist village of Altos de Chavón in 1976 and it was built by Bluhdorn in the early 1980s. Bluhdorn's daughter, Dominique Bluhdorn, is the current president of the Altos de Chavón Cultural Center. Altos de Chavón also has a 5,000 seat open air Greek style amphitheatre, which was inaugurated in 1982 by Frank Sinatra with the Concert for the Americas. Bluhdorn had Paramount Pictures record the concert so it could be shown all over the world. Viewers could see the Altos de Chavón artist village, the beauty of the landscapes, beaches and golf courses of Casa de Campo. ==Property== Casa de Campo, an hour away from Santo Domingo, was a exclusive retreat founded by Bluhdorn in 1974. His wife, Yvette, would sell the property after his death in 1984 to the Fanjul Brothers of Palm Beach, Florida. In February 2007 the Bedford, New York estate of his late wife, Yvette, was put on the market for the highest price ever asked for a Westchester County residence. Acquired in 1990 with , Mrs. Bluhdorn expanded the estate to . It included a restored , 23-room Georgian mansion built in the 1920s, another six-bedroom home of , several guest houses and two pools. A portion of Charles Bluhdorn's fortune continues with the Charles G. & Yvette Bluhdorn Charitable Trust. As of December 2005 it was reporting $2,396,383 in assets.

A very closely related variant, rake-and-scrape, is played in the Bahamas. Its most distinctive characteristic is the use of the common handsaw as the primary instrument, along with various kinds of drums, box guitar, concertina, triangle and accordion. The saw is played by scraping an object, usually an old knife blade, along the saw's teeth. The sound is similar to a paper being ripped, and is believed to be the origin of the term ripsaw. Rake-and-scrape derives from the method used by a player to create sound from the saw. Though little is known for certain about ripsaw's genesis, two major theories include that the instrument was played to imitate the sound of the güiro, a Dominican and Haiti percussion instrument, and that Loyalist colonists in the United States brought their African slaves to the islands and these slaves invented the ripsaw to imitate the sound of the shekere instrument. In the Bahamas, Cat Island is the only place to celebrate rake-and-scrape on a large scale. During June's Labour Day celebration, the island holds a Cat Island Rake and Scrape festival. ==References== == External links == * Music in the Turks and Caicos Islands at Turks and Caicos Tourist Board * Ripsaw Music & Our Musical Heritage, by David Bowen, Cultural Officer, Turks & Caicos Tourist Board.

Goombay music which is the original term used for Rake and Scrape in the Bahamas dates back to the 19th century where there were many bands playing many instruments together creating various sounds of early Goombay music. These instruments included the Banjo, Drums, Fife, Tambourines, Guitar, Wash Tubs, and Harmonicas and possibly even the Hand saw in certain settlements. It wasn't until the mid 20th century that the use of the Accordion, Goombay Drums, and the hand saw became a constant playing style that is known as traditional Rake and Scrape, and the combination of these instruments used to produce this sound has without any doubt originated in the Bahamas. Quote from Smithsonian Folkways recordings on the origin of Rake and scrape music in the Bahamas states \\"The rake and scrape band hails back to the 1800s, when the Africans who were brought to the Bahamas looked to make music on whatever was available to them: a carpenter's saw, pork barrels with goat or sheep skin to make a drum, and the accordion which might have been a gift from their colonial master.\\" ==References== Category:Bahamian music Category:Anglophone Caribbean music ","title":"Rake-and-scrape"},{"id":"1284303","text":"Douglas Alan Racine (born October 7, 1952 in Burlington, Vermont), is former Vermont Secretary of Human Services, a former Vermont State Senator and was the 78th Lieutenant Governor of Vermont.

In an election where no candidate won a majority, Douglas won a 45% plurality, and Racine declined to contest the outcome before the Vermont General Assembly. As of 2019, Racine is the last Democrat to have served as Lieutenant Governor of Vermont. ==Biography== Racine is a 1970 graduate of Burlington High School.

On September 15, 2017, Madigan announced that she would not seek re-election as the state's attorney general in 2018, and was succeeded by State Senator Kwame Raoul.http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/politics/ct-lisa-madigan- reelection-2018-met-0916-20170915-story.html ==Biography== ===Education=== Madigan attended The Latin School of Chicago for her secondary education. In 1988 she received her bachelor's degree from Georgetown University. She received her Juris Doctor (J.D.) from Loyola University Chicago School of Law. ===Early career=== Prior to becoming an attorney, she worked as a teacher and community organizer, developing after-school programs to help keep kids involved in education and away from drugs and gangs. Madigan also volunteered as a high school teacher in South Africa during apartheid. Madigan later worked as a litigator for the Chicago law firm of Sachnoff & Weaver. ===Political career=== Madigan speaks on the first day of the 2008 Democratic National Convention in Denver, Colorado. In 1998, at the age of 32, Madigan ran for Illinois state senator for the 17th District. She handily beat her primary opponent with 66% of the vote and ran unopposed in the general election. She served in that office from 1998 through 2003. In 2002, Madigan ran for Attorney General of Illinois and narrowly defeated DuPage County State's Attorney Joe Birkett with 50.4% of the vote. In 2004, Madigan became the first Illinois Attorney General in more than 25 years to personally argue a case before the United States Supreme Court. She successfully argued Illinois v. Caballes, where the court reaffirmed the ability of police officers to use specially trained dogs without a search warrant or probable cause to detect the presence of illegal drugs during traffic stops. Madigan was one of many Illinois politicians with strained relationships with now- convicted former Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich. (See Rod Blagojevich controversies.) Her father Michael Madigan, Speaker of the Illinois House of Representatives previously had a feud with Blagojevich, as highlighted by TIME magazine.http://content.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1868752,00.html On December 12, 2008, Madigan attracted national attention after filing a motion with the Supreme Court of Illinois to temporarily remove Governor Rod Blagojevich from office and install Lt.

He was the first Republican to hold that office since Frank Millard in 1955. Cox took office in 2003 and won re-election in 2006. Jennifer Granholm, who went on to become the Governor of Michigan, preceded him in office. Cox lost the Republican gubernatorial primary election August 3, 2010, coming in third behind Rick Snyder and Pete Hoekstra. ==Early life and education== Born in Detroit, Cox graduated from Detroit Catholic Central High School in 1980. He served in the United States Marine Corps from 1980 to 1983. He graduated from the University of Michigan in 1986 and earned his Juris Doctor from the University of Michigan Law School in 1989. == Career == He worked for the Oakland County Prosecutors' office from 1989 to 1990, then the Wayne County office from 1990 to 2002, before being elected Attorney General. Cox successfully ran for re- election in 2006, after receiving the Republican party nomination at the August Michigan Republican Party Convention. Cox left office in 2010 due to term limit requirements ironically pushed for by predecessor Republicans when a Democrat was in office. In 2011 he joined the prominent Detroit law firm, Dykema Gosset. Cox recently left Dykema Gosset to start The Mike Cox Law Firm. ===Attorney General of Michigan=== As attorney general, Cox took a prominent role in taking on Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan (BCBSM). Cox has opposed BCBSM supported bills and challenged BCBSM in court for the alleged transfer of nonprofit funds to purchase a for-profit company. In 2003, Cox created a cold case unit to investigate and prosecute cold cases. Cox's team has had notable convictions including Coral Watts, Gary Leiterman, John Rodney McRae, two brothers who killed two Oakland County hunters, two people who killed Christopher Brown, six people who murdered Janet Chandler in 1979, and most recently, Timothy Dawson who was convicted of killing his wife. ====Internet Predator Unit==== After Cox became Attorney General in 2003, he restructured the Child and Public Protection Unit to focus on aggressively protecting children from adults who would attempt to prey on young children over the internet. Cox's unit would identify those adults who would interact with children inappropriately and arrested more than 250 adults having one of the most successful units in the nation.–url= In 2006, the unit arrested Detroit consultant Ken Gourlay after Cox read a story in The New York Times depicting the abuse of Mr. Berry in the underground world of child pornography. In the story, Cox read that Mr. Berry was a Michigan resident and asked his team to investigate. Attorney General investigators found hundreds of computers with thousands of pornographic images in Gourlay's possession. Eventually, Gourlay was convicted of several charges including enticing a child to engage in sexually abusive activity and was sentenced to six years by circuit court judge Archie Brown in 2007. ====Detroit Mayor's mansion party==== Cox played a role in aftermath of a party at Manoogian Mansion, then the residence of Detroit Mayor Kwame Kilpatrick. Strippers were alleged to have been present at the party and allegedly assaulted; one dancer was murdered shortly after. Citing no evidence, no proof, and no witnesses, Cox declined to offer a subpoena, effectively closing an investigation by the State of Michigan into allegations of the \\"wild party.\\" The Michigan State Police continued its own separate investigation. Cox interviewed the Mayor with his chief criminal prosecutor. The police noted that Cox insisted on interviewing the former mayor alone without Michigan State Police officers present, because there were allegations of media leaks. State police officers have testified that they had strong leads that needed to be followed regarding the Manoogian Mansion party, that the state police believed that the Detroit Police Department was destroying evidence in the case, but \\"because of actions by Attorney General Mike Cox, they were powerless to stop them.\\" A state police memo indicated that they had wanted to interview the mayor and the mayor's wife, but because the attorney general had \\"shut down\\" the investigation, the state police could not get subpoenas, medical records or the cooperation of witnesses. In response, Cox said that he closed the investigation after interviewing more than 130 people who stated the party never took place, and called the accusations against him \\"absolute bullshit\\". Cox explained that the focus of his investigation was whether Kilpatrick's bodyguards were being paid illegal overtime to work the party. Cox also said that the police could have \\"went\\" to Wayne County Prosecutor Kym Worthy if they wanted subpoenas. Cox stated that he closed the investigation without interviewing the alleged perpetrator of the assault because the allegations only involved a misdemeanor and the state police did not need to interview the alleged perpetrator. In addition, Cox said that newspaper reporters did not find evidence that the police did not find. Seven years after the investigation, the party has not been proven to have occurred. However, after Cox ended the investigation, a records clerk at the police department has claimed that she saw a police report of an assault at the Manoogian Mansion. The chief of police from a nearby city alleged that he was invited to the party. A witness at a hospital claimed that an assault victim arrived for treatment with what appeared to be the then-mayor's security detail, and the witness was told by a co-worker that the victim had been beaten by the mayor's wife. A 9-1-1 dispatcher has also given testimony under oath in a civil deposition about officers who were dispatched to the Mansion regarding a disturbance. She said she was told by responding officers that Cox was present at the party. Mike Cox denied the accusation in a TV interview. More recently, a woman who alleges that she also danced at the Manogian Mansion party has come forward and has sworn under oath that not only did the party happen, but that she witnessed an assault by the former Mayor's wife on Tamara Greene at the party. She also has alleged that several Detroit police officers were guests at the party.Detroit Free Press, November 15, 2010 at pages A1 and A5. ==== Civil Rights ==== Mike Cox was one of the few elected officials to support the Michigan Civil Rights Initiative which was a constitutional amendment to ban racial and gender preferences for state institutions in 2006. In February 2003, Cox refused then-Governor Granholm's request for the State of Michigan to provide an amicus brief in support of the University of Michigan's admissions policies which allowed racial preferences. After Cox's refusal, then-Governor Granholm submitted a brief in her capacity as Governor supporting the University's position, not on behalf of the State of Michigan. The Michigan Civil Rights Initiative was passed by Michigan voters with a margin of 58%-42% in 2006 according to the Michigan Secretary of State. After passage, the group By Any Means Necessary challenged the constitutionality of the amendment in federal court to prevent implementation. As Attorney General, Cox immediately defended the constitutionality of the amendment and vigorously defended the amendment until his term ended in December 2010. In October 2013, the Department of Attorney General argued the defense of MCRI in the U.S. Supreme Court. On April 22, 2014, the Supreme Court ruled in favor of the State in Schuette v. Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action. ====Adultery law==== Cox received nationwide press in 2007 when the Michigan Court of Appeals ruled that adultery could be prosecuted as first-degree criminal sexual conduct with a resulting life in prison sentence. This unanimous decision was reached as a result of an appeal sought by Cox's office on a drug case that touched in part on this strange loophole in the law. In November 2005, Cox himself admitted to committing adultery while accusing Oakland County lawyer Geoffrey Fieger of blackmail, claiming that he threatened to reveal the affair if Cox did not drop an investigation into Fieger's campaign finance violations. Cox said his personal conduct was \\"inexcusable\\" and had reconciled with his wife. Pursuant to MCL 750.31, however, only Cox himself, his wife, or parties to the marriage (if any) of the co-adulterer or adulterers with whom he committed felonies may pursue a complaint for prosecution of felony adultery. Cox did not recuse himself from the decision to file a complaint for prosecution of his adultery notwithstanding the apparent conflict of interest. ====Health care==== Cox joined nineteen other state attorneys general, all but one being Republican, in challenging the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act after its passage. Critics contended that this action was a political move because Cox was running for governor. Timothy Stoltzfus Jost, a professor of law at the Washington and Lee University, has criticized this unusual move as being not only \\"frivolous\\" but a waste of taxpayers' dollars. ====Same-sex marriage==== In April 2013, Cox became one of the first high-profile Republicans in Michigan to support same-sex marriage. Cox urged the legislature to overturn the 2004 constitutional amendment banning gay marriage and civil unions. Cox said his views \\"evolved\\", and went on to say \\"Usually, I hate it when politicians say their views have evolved, but I guess mine have,\\" Cox said. \\"Part of it is I've just become more libertarian. I still think of myself as a social conservative.\\" ===2010 campaign for governor=== Cox filed paperwork to explore a bid for governor in 2008, and was the first person to form an exploratory committee. The Republican nominee in 2006, Dick DeVos, announced in November 2008 that he was not going to seek the GOP nomination in 2010. In March 2009, the Detroit Free Press reported that Cox led the likely Democratic challenger at the time, Lt. Governor John D. Cherry, by 41-34%. Cherry later decided not to run. On May 27, 2009, Cox formally announced his candidacy for governor on Facebook and Twitter. Local and national polling indicated in March 2010 that Cox was one of the front-runners for the Republican nomination, potentially defeating his potential Democratic opponents in the 2010 gubernatorial election by comfortable margins in hypothetical match-ups. Cox finished third in the Republican gubernatorial primary, behind businessman Rick Snyder and Congressman Pete Hoekstra. ==Electoral history== ===As Attorney General=== ===2010 gubernatorial election=== ==References== ==External links== * Mike Cox biography * Michigan Attorney General (official site) * Mike Cox 2010 for Governor (official campaign site) Category:1961 births Category:Living people Category:Michigan Attorneys General Category:Michigan Republicans Category:Politicians from Detroit Category:People from Livonia, Michigan Category:United States Marines Category:University of Michigan Law School alumni ","title":"Mike Cox (American politician)"},{"id":"1284311","text":"Johnson's algorithm is a way to find the shortest paths between all pairs of vertices in an edge-weighted, directed graph. It allows some of the edge weights to be negative numbers, but no negative-weight cycles may exist. It works by using the Bellman–Ford algorithm to compute a transformation of the input graph that removes all negative weights, allowing Dijkstra's algorithm to be used on the transformed graph.. Section 25.3, \\"Johnson's algorithm for sparse graphs\\", pp. 636–640.. It is named after Donald B. Johnson, who first published the technique in 1977.. A similar reweighting technique is also used in Suurballe's algorithm for finding two disjoint paths of minimum total length between the same two vertices in a graph with non-negative edge weights.. ==Algorithm description== Johnson's algorithm consists of the following steps: #First, a new node is added to the graph, connected by zero- weight edges to each of the other nodes. #Second, the Bellman–Ford algorithm is used, starting from the new vertex , to find for each vertex the minimum weight of a path from to . If this step detects a negative cycle, the algorithm is terminated. #Next the edges of the original graph are reweighted using the values computed by the Bellman–Ford algorithm: an edge from to , having length , is given the new length . #Finally, is removed, and Dijkstra's algorithm is used to find the shortest paths from each node to every other vertex in the reweighted graph. The distance in the original graph is then computed for each distance ( , ), by adding to the distance returned by Dijkstra's algorithm. ==Example== The first three stages of Johnson's algorithm are depicted in the illustration below. center The graph on the left of the illustration has two negative edges, but no negative cycles. At the center is shown the new vertex , a shortest path tree as computed by the Bellman–Ford algorithm with as starting vertex, and the values computed at each other node as the length of the shortest path from to that node. Note that these values are all non-positive, because has a length-zero edge to each vertex and the shortest path can be no longer than that edge. On the right is shown the reweighted graph, formed by replacing each edge weight by . In this reweighted graph, all edge weights are non-negative, but the shortest path between any two nodes uses the same sequence of edges as the shortest path between the same two nodes in the original graph. The algorithm concludes by applying Dijkstra's algorithm to each of the four starting nodes in the reweighted graph. ==Correctness== In the reweighted graph, all paths between a pair and of nodes have the same quantity added to them. The previous statement can be proven as follows: Let be an path. Its weight W in the reweighted graph is given by the following expression: :\\\\bigl(w(s, p_1) + h(s) - h(p_1)\\\\bigr) + \\\\bigl(w(p_1, p_2) + h(p_1) - h(p_2)\\\\bigr) + ... + \\\\bigl(w(p_n, t) + h(p_n) - h(t)\\\\bigr). Every +h(p_i) is cancelled by -h(p_i) in the previous bracketed expression; therefore, we are left with the following expression for W: :\\\\bigl(w(s, p_1) + w(p_1, p_2) + ... + w(p_n, t)\\\\bigr)+ h(s) - h(t) The bracketed expression is the weight of p in the original weighting. Since the reweighting adds the same amount to the weight of every path, a path is a shortest path in the original weighting if and only if it is a shortest path after reweighting. The weight of edges that belong to a shortest path from q to any node is zero, and therefore the lengths of the shortest paths from q to every node become zero in the reweighted graph; however, they still remain shortest paths. Therefore, there can be no negative edges: if edge uv had a negative weight after the reweighting, then the zero-length path from q to u together with this edge would form a negative-length path from q to v, contradicting the fact that all vertices have zero distance from q. The non- existence of negative edges ensures the optimality of the paths found by Dijkstra's algorithm. The distances in the original graph may be calculated from the distances calculated by Dijkstra's algorithm in the reweighted graph by reversing the reweighting transformation. ==Analysis== The time complexity of this algorithm, using Fibonacci heaps in the implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm, is O(V^2\\\\log V + VE): the algorithm uses O(VE) time for the Bellman–Ford stage of the algorithm, and O(V\\\\log V + E) for each of the V instantiations of Dijkstra's algorithm. Thus, when the graph is sparse, the total time can be faster than the Floyd–Warshall algorithm, which solves the same problem in time O(V^3). ==References== == External links == *Boost: All Pairs Shortest Paths Category:Graph algorithms Category:Search algorithms ","title":"Johnson's algorithm"},{"id":"1284313","text":"Terri Lynn Land (born June 30, 1958) is an American politician who served as Michigan's 41st Secretary of State. In 2012, Land was elected to the Republican National Committee. She was the Republican nominee for the 2014 United States Senate race in Michigan, losing in the general election to Democrat Gary Peters. == Early life and education == Land was born in Grand Rapids, Michigan. Land grew up in Grandville, Michigan, graduating from Grandville High School. She attended Hope College in Holland, Michigan, where she received a Bachelor of Arts in political science. In 2009, Land was awarded an honorary doctorate degree from Davenport University. == Politics == === Early political career === In 1980, Land joined the Grandville Planning Commission. At age 23, Land ran for the Michigan House of Representatives, unsuccessfully challenging incumbent Democrat Jelt Sietsema. From 1992-2000, she was the elected Clerk of Kent County, the fourth largest county of Michigan. In 2000, with Gov. John Engler's encouragement, Land ran unsuccessfully for the Michigan State Board of Education. === Michigan Secretary of State === In 2002, Land became Michigan's 41st Secretary of State, defeating Melvin Hollowell, a Detroit-based attorney, 55%-43% and took office on January 1, 2003. Land and her husband contributed more than $1.9 million of their own money in the 2002 and 2006 Secretary of State campaigns. The Grand Rapids Press editorial board praised Land for her technological transformation of state services, including updates to computer systems; expansion of Web services; consolidation of branch offices and \\"expanded hours in new, larger locations\\"; and changes that for the first time allowed Michigan customers to pay fees with credit cards and renew license plate registrations through self-service stations. The Press editorial board wrote that, against the opposition of some Republicans, Land \\"advocated measures that would expand participation at the polls, including early voting, no- reason absentee voting and early registration for young voters.\\" In 2005, Land's office announced an effort to use the Help America Vote Act to reduce potential voter fraud by removing names of voters who had died, moved out of Michigan, or changed their names. A New York Times investigation found that 33,000 people were removed from the rolls, while Land's office said 11,000 voters were removed. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) took Michigan to court over the removal of voter names. The Times pointed out that similar problems were seen in other states, as \\"Republican and Democratic election officials ... struggled to interpret new federal laws, such as the Help America Vote Act.\\" In October 2008, a federal judge ruled that the national Voting Rights Act had been violated and six states, including Michigan, were ordered to stop removing names from voter rolls. A spokesperson for the Secretary of State's office told the Detroit Free Press that, \\"If you're eligible to vote, you will be able to cast a vote on Election Day\\". In 2006, she was elected to a second term, defeating Macomb County Clerk Carmella Sabaugh 56%-42%. After serving two terms, the maximum allowed in the state, she was succeeded by Republican Ruth Johnson. === 2010 gubernatorial race === After exploring a bid for Michigan governor in 2010, Land decided not to run in June 2009, instead endorsing Mike Bouchard. She ran for lieutenant governor on a ticket with Bouchard the following year, but lost in the Republican primary. === 2014 U.S. Senate election === On June 3, 2013 Land announced her candidacy for the United States Senate in 2014. She ran unopposed in the primary and faced Democratic congressman Gary Peters in the general election. According to an early analysis by the Washington Post, the U.S. Senate election in Michigan was considered one of the top 10 Senate races of 2014. Land outraised Peters throughout the campaign. Her largest independent backer was Americans for Prosperity, which spent $3.6 million in support of her candidacy. In 2014, Land gave $3 million to her own campaign, saying, \\"You can't ask other people to invest in you if you don't invest in yourself.\\" In her federal financial disclosure form, she had not listed any bank accounts or other assets in her control worth that much. Her campaign said that it had mistakenly failed to disclose a joint account she had with her husband. A Detroit Free Press review of financial disclosure forms showed Land and her husband had assets worth $35 million in 2014, with $1.5 million belonging to Land, and that \\"candidates may typically tap liberally into joint accounts with their spouses.\\" In May 2014, Land gave a speech at the Mackinac Policy Conference, a three-day event that many of the state's top business and civic leaders attend, which she read from notes. Following her speech, Land was swarmed by reporters and, unable to articulate a response to a question, pushed their microphones away, saying, \\"I can't do this.\\" Land was endorsed by the entire Michigan Republican delegation, as well as former congressman Pete Hoekstra, the Family Research Council, and National Right to Life. Her campaign was weighed down by various missteps and her reluctance to make public campaign appearances, particularly after her meltdown in May. Peters opened up a consistent lead in the polls beginning in September. The Republican establishment effectively gave up on Land's campaign the following month.http://atr.rollcall.com/senate-races-2014-why-michigan-never-became- iowa/ In the November 4 general election, Land received 41.3% of the vote to Peters's 54.6%.New York Times, November 5, 2014, pg. 1 === Voting rights lawsuit === In September 2020, Land filed a lawsuit against Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson for allowing votes postmarked before election day to be counted after election day. == Personal life == Land married Dan Hibma in 1983.

The station is owned by RNC Media, as part of a twinstick with TVA affiliate CHOT-DT (channel 40). The two stations share studios on Rue Jean Proulx and Rue Buteau in the former city of Hull; CFGS-DT's transmitter is located at Camp Fortune in Chelsea, Quebec. This station can also be seen on Vidéotron channel 5 and in high definition channel 605, Rogers Cable on channel 11, channel 605, in high definition on digital channel 606, and on Shaw Direct, in HD on channel 214 and SD on 725. CFGS-DT is the largest Noovo station that is not owned-and-operated by the network. It is also the second major network affiliate in Canada in a media market that is not owned by its associated network, after CHOT. ==Overview== It was originally broadcast on UHF channel 49 from its debut on September 7, 1986, until moving to its current over-the-air channel position in 2001. However, prior to changing its listings to national listings only, TV Guide always had this station listed as Channel 49. CFGS's operation is considerably smaller than sister station CHOT — the station only airs a 10-minute local newscast weekdays at 5:30 p.m. anchored by Louka Jacques, along with brief news updates in the morning and in the evening. There are only two anchors (one for the morning news update and one for the 5:30 p.m. news). For a brief period in 2006, there was an occasional commentary by former MP Françoise Boivin on stories that made headlines. ==Digital television and high definition== The analog television shutdown and digital conversion, took place on August 31, 2011, however, CFGS- TV was granted a temporary extension for their analogue broadcasts.

Marcus Collins, \\"The Pornography of Permissiveness\\", History Workshop Journal 1999(47):99-120 and is published every four weeks, making thirteen issues per year. Each edition consists of one hundred printed pages and is staple-bound, with the exception of the slightly larger \\"special edition\\", published at the start of each new volume, which has some 120 pages and flat glued binding. Club International is published by Paul Raymond Publications, which publishes eight of the UK's ten top adult magazines. Along with Mayfair Magazine, Club International is considered the most upmarket of Raymond's top shelf productions, with the photo spreads generally featuring more attractive models shot by experienced photographers. == Content == Each edition of Club International features ten photosets, with the exception of the slightly larger \\"special edition\\" which features between twelve and thirteen sets. The photosets are usually single- model shoots but there are also lesbian scenes. The shoots are generally softcore, and as such do not feature any sort of penetration or oral-genital contact. However some photoshoots feature the occasional \\"pink\\" shot, where a model exposes her vaginal lips. During the early to mid-1980s, a regular feature was \\"Club Event\\", a picture sequence involving a group of models (usually about half a dozen) performing a form of striptease around a central theme such as a Christmas party, or whilst wearing (and removing) various types of uniforms. === Models === The magazine has featured a number of well- known models and pornstars, such as Lexi Lowe, Tanya Tate, Monica Sweet, Zsanett Égerházi, Sandra Shine, Peaches, Silvia Saint, Stephanie Swift, and popular Hungarian model Sophie Moone (often credited as 'Stella'). Also among the women featured is the \\"Reader's Girlfriend\\", presented as an amateur model who is the girlfriend of a Club International reader. === Features === Long- running features in Club International include its regular readers' letters page, \\"Talkin' Blue\\", where 'readers' share tales of their sexual experiences, and \\"Peaches\\", a feature that covers anal sex (although the writing is far more explicit than the images that accompany the feature). As with a number of similar men's magazines, there are the regular automotive features, editorials, video and book reviews, as well as a jokes page. Starting in 2008, a free DVD has been included with every issue. ===Online edition === Club International also has a digital identity on the Paul Raymond website, where the hardcore imagery not found in the print version is also shown.

Before a person is naturalized as a U.S. citizen, they must be a green card holder for at least 5 years and satisfy all other naturalization requirements. Permanent residency is a person's resident status in a country of which they are not citizens but where they have the right to reside on a permanent basis. This is usually for a permanent period; a person with such status is known as a permanent resident. In the United States, such a person is officially referred to as a Lawful Permanent Resident (LPR). Permanent residency itself is distinct from right of abode, which waives immigration control for such persons. Persons having permanent residency still require immigration control if they do not have right of abode. However, a right of abode automatically grants people permanent residency. This status also gives work permit in most cases. In many western countries, the status of permanent resident confers a right of abode upon the holder despite not being a citizen of the particular country. ==Countries with permanent residency systems== Not every country allows permanent residency. Rights and application may vary widely. All European Union countries have a facility for someone to become a permanent resident, as EU legislation allows an EU national who moves to another EU country to attain permanent resident status after residing there for five years. The European Union also sets out permanent residency rights for long-term resident third country nationals under directive (2003/109/EC). A novel approach was the granting of rights across the national borders of states adhering to the directive. As Hong Kong and Macau, both special administrative regions of China, do not have their own citizenship laws, the term \\"permanent residents\\" refer to persons with the right of abode in these territories. Most permanent residents of Chinese descent are Chinese citizens according to Chinese nationality law. Other countries have varying forms of such residency and relationships with other countries with regards to permanent residency. Japanese permission for permanent residence issued in 2011 on a French passport.

Spouses who have no other connection to India other than being married to someone with or eligible for OCI can also apply for OCI if they have been married for at least two years.

The Trans-Tasman Travel Arrangement between Australia and New Zealand allows citizens of the two countries to live and work in the other country.

Dating back to the 1980s, golden visas became much more popular and available in the 21st century. Golden visas require investments of anywhere from $100,000 in Dominica up to £2,000,000 in the U.K. The most common method for obtaining a golden visa is through the purchase of real estate with a minimum value. Some countries such as Malta and Cyprus also offer \\"golden passports\\" (citizenship) to individuals if they invest a certain sum.Where is the cheapest place to buy citizenship?, By Kim Gittleson BBC reporter, New York, 4 June 2014, https://www.bbc.com/news/business-27674135 The issuing of so-called \\"golden visas\\" has sparked controversy in several countries.Canada kills investor visa popular with Chinese, by Sophia Yan @sophia_yan March 25, 2014: 2:21 AM ET , CNN, Buying their way in, Economist 22 november 2014 == Limitations of permanent residents == Depending on the country, permanent residents usually have the same rights as citizens except for the following: * they may not vote (though in some cases such as the UK's Commonwealth citizens, New Zealand voting is allowed) * they may not stand for public office (except European Union citizens permanently residing in other EU member states who may stand in local and European elections) * in most cases they may not hold public sector employment. Canada and New Zealand allow this; some countries, such as Brazil and Portugal, allow it only for permanent residents holding citizenship of another country of shared heritage) * they may not usually apply for employment involving national security. In Singapore, male PRs who have been granted PR before the age of 18 have to serve national service. Most first- generation males are exempted. * they may not own certain classes of real estate * they are not issued the passport of that country (unless otherwise stateless or unable to obtain a passport from their country of nationality, in which case they may be entitled to a certificate of identity instead) * they do not have access to the country's consular protection (some countries such as Australia allow this) * they may qualify to apply for citizenship after meeting a specified period of residence == Obligations of permanent residents == Permanent residents may be required to fulfil specific residence obligations to maintain their status. In some cases, permanent residency may be conditional on a certain type of employment or maintenance of a business. Many countries have compulsory military service for citizens. Some countries, such as Singapore, extend this to permanent residents. However, in Singapore, most first generation permanent residents are exempted, and only their sons are held liable for national service. In a similar approach, the United States has Selective Service, a compulsory registration for military service, which is required of all male citizens and permanent residents ages 18 to 26; this requirement theoretically applies even to those residing in the country illegally. Applications for citizenship may be denied or otherwise impeded if the applicant cannot prove having complied with this requirement. Permanent residents may be required to reside in the country offering them residence for a given minimum length of time (as in Australia and Canada). Permanent residents may lose their status if they stay outside their host country for more than a specified period of time (as in the United States). Permanent residents have the same obligations as citizens regarding taxes. == Loss of status == Permanent residents may lose their status if they fail to comply with residency or other obligations imposed on them. For example: * they leave the country beyond a maximum number of days (varies among countries but usually more than 2 years) * they become a threat to national security, or they commit serious crimes and become subject to deportation or removal from the country == Access to citizenship == Usually permanent residents may apply for citizenship by naturalization after a period of permanent residency (typically five years) in the country concerned. Dual citizenship may or may not be permitted. In many nations an application for naturalization can be denied on character grounds, sometimes allowing people to reside in the country (as non-domiciled) but not become citizens. In the United States the residency requirements for citizenship are normally five years, even though permanent residents who have been married to a US citizen for three years or more may apply in three years. Those who have served in the armed forces may qualify for an expedited process allowing citizenship after only one year, or even without any residence requirement.General Naturalization Requirements ===Golden Passports=== Since the 1990s, in addition to golden visas some countries have begun to offer golden passports to foreign nationals who invest (often through the purchase of property) a certain sum into the issuing country's economy.The Oxford Handbook of Citizenship, Ayelet Shachar, Chapter 35, Citizenship For Sale?, pg. 790, Oxford University Press, 2017 The issuing of EU passports by Malta and Cyprus has sparked controversy but is expected to produced billions of euros in revenue for the issuing countries.Malta’s golden passport scheme draws fresh criticism, Concerns centre on selection of Jersey consultancy to run operation targeted at the wealthy, FT.com, https://www.ft.com/content/6f98892e-fbf3-11e5-b3f6-11d5706b613b == Automatic entitlement == Full permanent residence rights are granted automatically between the following: * Ireland and the United Kingdom including general election voting rights. * the states of the Nordic Council * Russian Federation and Republic of Belarus * India and Nepal In some cases (e.g., the member states of the European Union) citizens of participating countries can live and work at will in each other's states, but don't have a status fully equivalent to that of a permanent resident. In particular, under the Trans- Tasman Travel Arrangement, Australia and New Zealand grant each other's citizens the right to reside permanently and work in each country; however, the rights and entitlements of New Zealanders living in Australia under this arrangement (the so-called Special Category Visa) are somewhat short of those of Australian permanent residents, in particular with respect to unemployment benefits and similar benefits. ==Proof of permanent residency== People who are granted permanent residency in a country are usually issued some sort of documentary evidence as legal proof of this status. In the past, many countries merely stamped the person's passport indicating that the holder was admitted as a permanent resident or that he/she was exempt from immigration control and permitted to work without restriction. Other countries would issue a photo ID card, place a visa sticker or certificate of residence in the person's passport, or issue a letter to confirm their permanent resident status. *In Australia and New Zealand, a printout of permanent residence visa or resident visa is stuck to a page of the permanent resident's passport.

Benson beat Nicaragua to open up the games and then Japan, but it was his single loss (11–2 to eventual silver medalist Japan) which proved costly. Benson lasted only four innings and surrendered five runs, and the bullpen gave up another six, en route to an 11–2 bludgeoning that kept the Americans from advancing to the gold medal game.Official Olympic Report, 1996 Atlanta (Vol. 3): pp. 116–125.

Through intermarriages with other noble families, notably the Doukai, Angeloi, and Palaiologoi, the Komnenos name appears among most of the major noble houses of the late Byzantine world. ==Origins== The 11th-century Byzantine historian Michael Psellos reported that the Komnenos family originated from the village of Komne in Thrace—usually identified with the \\"Fields of Komnene\\" () mentioned in the 14th century by John Kantakouzenos—a view commonly accepted by modern scholarship. The first known member of the family, Manuel Erotikos Komnenos, acquired extensive estates at Kastamon in Paphlagonia, which became the stronghold of the family in the 11th century. The family thereby quickly became associated with the powerful and prestigious military aristocracy (dynatoi) of Asia Minor, so that despite its Thracian origins it came to be considered \\"eastern\\". The 17th- century French scholar du Cange suggested that the family descended from a Roman noble family that followed Constantine the Great to Constantinople, but although such mythical genealogies were common—and are indeed attested for the closely related Doukas clan—the complete absence of any such assertion in the Byzantine sources argues against Du Cange's view. The Romanian historian George Murnu suggested in 1924 that the Komnenoi were of Aromanian descent, but this view too is now rejected. Modern scholars consider the family to have been entirely of Greek origin. Manuel Erotikos Komnenos was the father of Isaac I Komnenos (reigned 1057-1059) and grandfather, through Isaac's younger brother John Komnenos, of Alexios I Komnenos (reigned 1081-1118). ==Founding the dynasty== Isaac I Komnenos, a stratopedarch of the East under Michael VI, founded the Komnenos dynasty of Byzantine emperors. In 1057 Isaac led a coup against Michael and was proclaimed emperor. Although his reign lasted only till 1059, when his courtiers pressured him to abdicate and become a monk, Isaac initiated many useful reforms. The dynasty returned to the throne with the accession of Alexios I Komnenos, Isaac I's nephew, in 1081. By this time, descendants of all the previous dynasties of Byzantium seem to have disappeared from the realm, such as the important Scleros and Argyros families. Descendants of those emperors lived abroad, having married into the royal families of Georgia, Russia, France, Persia, Italy, Germany, Poland, Bulgaria, Hungary and Serbia; this made it easier for the Komnenos family to ascend to the throne. Upon their rise to the throne, the Komnenoi became intermarried with the previous Doukas dynasty: Alexios I married Irene Doukaina, the grandniece of Constantine X Doukas, who had succeeded Isaac I in 1059. Thereafter the combined clan often was referred as \\"Komnenodoukai\\" (Latinized \\"Comnenoducae\\") and several individuals used both surnames together. Several families descended from the Komnenodoukai, such as Palaiologos, Angelos, Vatatzes and Laskaris. Alexios and Irene's youngest daughter Theodora ensured the future success of the Angelos family by marrying into it: Theodora's grandsons became the emperors Isaac II Angelos (reigned 1185–1195 and 1203–1204) and Alexios III Angelos (reigned 1195-1203). ==Komnenoi as emperors== Alexios I Komnenos. Under Alexios I and his successors the Empire was fairly prosperous and stable. Alexios moved the imperial palace to the Blachernae section of Constantinople. Much of Anatolia was recovered from the Seljuk Turks, who had captured it just prior to Alexios' reign. Alexios also saw the First Crusade pass through Byzantine territory, leading to the establishment of the Crusader states in the east. The Komnenos dynasty was very much involved in crusader affairs, and also intermarried with the reigning families of the Principality of Antioch and the Kingdom of Jerusalem - Theodora Komnene, niece of Manuel I Komnenos, married Baldwin III of Jerusalem, and Maria, grandniece of Manuel, married Amalric I of Jerusalem. Remarkably, Alexios ruled for 37 years, and his son John II ruled for 25, after uncovering a conspiracy against him by his sister, the chronicler Anna Komnene. John's son Manuel ruled for another 37 years. The Komnenos dynasty produced a number of branches. As imperial succession was not in a determined order but rather depended on personal power and the wishes of one's predecessor, within a few generations several relatives were able to present themselves as claimants. After Manuel I's reign the Komnenos dynasty fell into conspiracies and plots like many of its predecessors (and the various contenders within the family sought power and often succeeded in overthrowing the preceding kinsman); Alexios II, the first Komnenos to ascend as a minor, ruled for three years and his conqueror and successor Andronikos I ruled for two, overthrown by the Angelos family under Isaac II who was dethroned and blinded by his own brother Alexios III. The Angeloi were overthrown during the Fourth Crusade in 1204, by Alexios V Doukas, a relative from the Doukas family. ==Later family== Several weeks before the occupation of Constantinople by crusaders in 1204, one branch of the Komnenoi fled back to their homelands in Paphlagonia, along the eastern Black Sea and its hinterland in the Pontic Alps, where they established the Empire of Trebizond. Their first 'emperor', named Alexios I, was the grandson of Emperor Andronikos I.A. A. Vasiliev, \\"The Foundation of the Empire of Trebizond (1204-1222)\\", Speculum, 11 (1936), pp. 3-37 These emperors – the \\"Grand Komnenoi\\" (Megaloi Komnenoi or Megalokomnenoi) as they were known – ruled in Trebizond for over 250 years, until 1461, when David Komnenos was defeated and executed by the Ottoman sultan Mehmed II.Discussed by Ruth Macrides, \\"What's in the name 'Megas Komnenos'?\\" Archeion Pontou, 35 (1979), pp. 236-245 Mehmed himself claimed descent from the Komnenos family via John Tzelepes Komnenos. The Trapezutine branch of the Komnenos dynasty also held the name of Axouchos as descendants of John Axouch, a Byzantine nobleman and minister to the Byzantine Komnenian Dynasty. A princess of the Trebizond branch is said to have been the mother of prince Yahya (born 1585), who reportedly became a Christian yet spent much of his life attempting to gain the Ottoman throne. Another branch of the family founded the Despotate of Epirus in 1204, under Michael I Komnenos Doukas, great-grandson of Emperor Alexios I. Helena Doukaina Komnene, a child of that branch of the family, married Guy I de la Roche thereby uniting the Komnenos and the de la Roche houses, with Komnenos family members eventually becoming Dukes of Athens. One renegade member of the family, also named Isaac Komnenos, established a separate \\"empire\\" on Cyprus in 1184, which lasted until 1191, when the island was taken from him by Richard I of England during the Third Crusade. His daughter, called the Damsel of Cyprus, married Thierry of Flanders during the Fourth Crusade and tried to claim the island. When the eastern Empire was restored in 1261 at Constantinople, it was ruled by a family closely related to the Komnenoi, the Palaiologos family. The Palaiologoi ruled until the fall of Constantinople to the Ottoman Turks in 1453. The last descendant of the dynasty is often considered to have been John Komnenos Molyvdos, a distinguished Ottoman Greek scholar and physician, who became metropolitan bishop of Side and Dristra, and died in 1719. His claims to descent from the imperial dynasty of Trebizond, however, are most likely a fabrication. In 1782, the Corsican Greek notable Demetrio Stefanopoli obtained letters patent from Louis XVI of France recognizing him as the descendant and heir of the Emperors of Trebizond. ==Komnenian ancestry in Western Europe== Irene Angelina, daughter of Isaac II Angelos and a thus a descendant of Alexios I Komnenos, married Philip of Swabia, the King of Germany. From this union many of the royal and aristocratic families of Western Europe can trace a line of descent.Bruno W.

With a voice as silvery and luminous as a full moon, Harmer constructs daring metaphors to convey emotional perplexities... songs like the rueful 'Tether' display Harmer's gift for setting human drama to fresh melodies.\\" Paul Cantin of No Depression praised the album and remarked on its themes of rural life and the outdoors, also writing \\"... while there's nothing here that quite reaches the dramatic punch of the latter album's standout songs... All Of Our Names confirms that Harmer is, by any other name, a formidable, singular talent who has amply rewarded the patience of her fans.\\" ==Track listing== All songs written by Sarah Harmer. #\\"Pendulums\\" – 3:26 #\\"Almost\\" – 3:57 #\\"Greeting Card Aisle\\" – 4:37 #\\"New Enemy\\" – 3:54 #\\"Silver Road\\" – 3:38 #\\"Dandelions in Bullet Holes\\" – 6:02 #\\"Things to Forget\\" – 3:34 #\\"Came on Lion\\" – 3:10 #\\"Took it All\\" – 4:41 #\\"Tether\\" – 3:21 #\\"Go to Sleep\\" – 3:38 ==Personnel== *Sarah Harmer – vocals, guitar, bass, piano, synthesizer, drums, glockenspiel, Wurlitzer, Juno *Gavin Brown – guitar, drums, Wurlitzer, baritone guitar *Howie Beck – bass, drums *Jim Bryson – guitar *Kevin Fox – cello *Fuzzy – drums *Maury LaFoy – bass, upright bass *John Obercian – drums *Benji Perosin – trumpet on \\"Came On Lion\\" and \\"Tether\\" *Ian Thornley – guitar on \\"Pendulums\\" ==Production== *Produced by Sarah Harmer, Martin Kinack and Gavin Brown *Engineered by Eric Ratz and Sarah Harmer *Mixed by Eric Ratz, Gavin Brown and Sarah Harmer *Mastered by Greg Calbi *Art direction by Steven Jurgensmeyer and Sarah Harmer *Cover photo by Andrew MacNaughten ==References== Category:2004 albums Category:Sarah Harmer albums Category:Zoë Records albums Category:Juno Award for Adult Alternative Album of the Year albums ","title":"All of Our Names"},{"id":"1284386","text":"DNI may stand for: * Direct neural interface, a brain-computer interface * Direct normal irradiance, a measure of the Solar irradiance striking a surface held normal to the line of sight to the sun * Direct normal insolation, also known as direct insolation, a measure of the solar irradiance striking a surface held normal to line of sight to the sun * Digital Network Intelligence, the NSA term for the collection of data from the Internet * Director of National Intelligence, a Cabinet-level executive position that oversees the United States Intelligence Community * Director of Naval Intelligence (disambiguation) * Documento Nacional de Identidad (Spain), the Spanish national identity document * Documento Nacional de Identidad (Argentina), the Argentine national identity document * Dole Nutrition Institute founded by the Dole Food Company * Do not intubate, an alternate term for \\"do not resuscitate\\" * Do not install, a term sometimes used in Printed circuit board design to denote the omitting of a component * Lower Grand Valley Dani language (ISO 639 code: dni) * Wad Medani Airport (IATA airport code: DNI) * DNI, a title students get when they graduate from ZUYD Hogeschool ==See also== * D'ni, a culture in the Myst series * DNIS, a telephone service feature ","title":"DNI"},{"id":"1284387","text":"Bellechasse may refer to: In Quebec, Canada: * Bellechasse (Lower Canada), an electoral district 1829–1838 * Bellechasse (Province of Canada), an electoral district 1841–1867 * Bellechasse (electoral district), 1867–1996 * Bellechasse (provincial electoral district), 1867–present * Bellechasse Regional County Municipality, Quebec == See also == * Bellechasse County (defunct by 2008) * Belle Chasse, Louisiana ","title":"Bellechasse"},{"id":"1284390","text":"Bittern is a classification of wading birds in the heron family.

Up to sixteen of these machines could be connected to proprietary multi-user systems through serial interfaces. In April, 1983, TeleVideo introduced an MS-DOS 2.0 compatible personal computer based on the Intel 8088. This was introduced as the Model TS-1603 and included 128 KB RAM (expandable up to 256 KB), integrated monitor, modem and keyboard. The Model TS-1603 ran both TeleVideo PC DOS 2.0 and CP/M-86 1.1.

Originally called Phoenix Mountain Park, it was formed in 1924 when President Calvin Coolidge sold its initial 13,000 acres (53 km²) to the city of Phoenix for $17,000.

Since the naming, suburban growth has nearly surrounded the park. Ahwatukee now borders to the south and Laveen to the west. South Mountain was originally known as the Salt River Mountains.

He was a homosexual, and at least one of his novels portrays a gay relationship, but whether he lived as openly gay himself is unclear. ==Early life: South Africa== Plomer was born in Pietersburg, in the Transvaal Colony, now Polokwane in the Limpopo Province of South Africa, on 10 December 1903. His parents were English; his father was a colonial civil servant, and the family moved between England and South Africa several times during Plomer's youth, with Plomer educated mostly in the UK, until his father left the civil service and took over a trading station in the Zululand region. Plomer insisted on the pronunciation of his name as \\"\\" (to rhyme with \\"rumour\\"), although his family pronounced it in the usual way. He started writing his first novel, Turbott Wolfe, when he was just 21, which brought him fame (or notoriety) in the Union of South Africa upon publication in 1925, which had inter-racial love and marriage as a theme. He was co- founder, editor and major contributor of the short-lived literary magazine Voorslag (\\"Whiplash\\") with two other South African rebels, Roy Campbell and Laurens van der Post in 1926. It included material in both English and Afrikaans, and intended to publish in the Zulu language, and also attempted to portray the more superior standards of European culture, while promoting a racially equal South Africa. Campbell resigned in protest against the editorial control exerted by the financial backer of the magazine. It never gained a wide readership. ==1926: Japan== Plomer became a special correspondent for the Natal Witness, but after Van der Post had met and befriended two Japanese men, one being the Japanese captain of a yacht, Katsue Mori, he and Plomer sailed for Japan in September 1926, Plomer leaving South Africa for the last time. Plomer stayed in Japan until March 1929, completing two volumes of short stories (I speak of Africa and Paper Houses) as well as a collection of poetry. He became friends with academic, poet and author Sherard Vines. There he fell in love with a Japanese man, Morito Fukuzawa, who became the model for the title character of Sado. ==1929: England== He then travelled through Korea, China, the Soviet Union, Poland, Germany, and Belgium to England and, through his friendship with his publisher Virginia Woolf and husband Leonard Woolf, entered the London literary circles. Among his friends there were Christopher Isherwood, W.H. Auden, Forster, J.R. Ackerley and Stephen Spender. The Woolfs, under their imprint the Hogarth Press, published Sado in 1931 and The Case is Altered in 1932, the latter becoming his most commercially successful novel. In 1933 Plomer left Hogarth amicably (Selected Poems was published by Hogarth in 1940) and published The Child of Queen Victoria and Other Stories with Jonathan Cape. He became a literary editor for Faber and Faber, and became chief reader and literary adviser to Jonathan Cape from 1937 to 1940, where he recognised the saleability of, and edited the first and many more of Ian Fleming's James Bond series. Fleming dedicated Goldfinger to Plomer. From 1937, Plomer took part in BBC radio broadcasts, and contributed to the Aldeburgh Festival from its start in 1948. From the late 1950s, he contributed to frequent poetry readings and events, served on the Arts Council and the board of the Society of Authors. He is known to have used the pseudonym \\"Robert Pagan\\", notably for some of his poetry. He was also active as a librettist, with Gloriana, Curlew River, The Burning Fiery Furnace and The Prodigal Son for Benjamin Britten. At least one source (Alexander) says that Plomer was never openly gay during his lifetime; at most he alluded to the subject. However Southworth says that he lived relatively openly as a homosexual in Japan, and portrayed gay relationships in a number of his novels, including Sado, The Case is Altered, and The Invaders. ==Later life, death== In later life he collaborated with artist Alan Aldridge on a book of children’s verse, The Butterfly Ball and the Grasshopper’s Feast. Plomer described himself as \\"Anglo-African-Asian\\" in a 1967 article of that name, nearly 40 years after his return to England. The England and Wales National Probate Calendar records that he died at 43, Adastra Avenue in Hassocks, West Sussex (Cuckfield Vol 5H, Page 547, 3rd Quarter of 1973), (another source gives Lewes (the location of a nearby hospital) as place of death). The death occurred on 20 September 1973 aged 69 in the arms of his partner of almost thirty years, Charles Erdmann.Obituary, The Times, London, 22 September 1973, page 16. The date given by Encyclopaedia Britannica is incorrect. The date cited in the London Gazette is also incorrect. ==Recognition, legacy== In 1951 Plomer was elected a fellow of the Royal Society of Literature. He was awarded an honorary D.Litt. by the University of Durham in 1959. In 1966 he chaired the panel of judges for the Cholmondeley Award. He won the Queen's Gold Medal for Poetry in 1963. He was publicly tipped for the Poet Laureateship in 1967 and 1972. He was awarded a CBE in 1968. In 1958 he was elected president of the Poetry Society. In 1976, the inaugural Mofolo-Plomer Prize, created by Nadine Gordimer and so named in honour of Basotho writer Thomas Mofolo and Plomer, was awarded to Mbulelo Mzamane. The judges for that year were Chinua Achebe, Alan Paton and Adam Small. Since then, Achmat Dangor, JM Coetzee, Njabulo Simakahle Ndebele, Rose Zwi and Peter Wilhelm have been other recipients of the prize. Nadine Gordimer, in her introduction to a new edition of Turbott Wolfe in 2003, said that the novel deserved recognition as being in the \\"canon of renegade colonialist literature along with Conrad\\", and others have noted its experimental narrative structure, which puts it (along with some of his other work) in the category of a modernist novel. His last work, the collection of children's poems entitled The Butterfly Ball and the Grasshopper’s Feast, won the 1973 Whitbread Award. Durham University has an extensive collection of Plomer's literary papers and correspondence, as well as his library of printed books, and lists a full bibliography on its website. A portrait of Plomer seated on a chair, in oils, dated 1929, by Edward Wolfe, and several photographs of Plomer, by Howard Coster and others are held by the National Portrait Gallery in London. ==Works== * 1925.

Founded in 1893, it was located in the Cascade Range at the west portal of the original Cascade Tunnel under Stevens Pass. It was the site of the 1910 Wellington avalanche, the worst in U.S. history, in which 96 people died.Ballard C. Campbell: 1910 Wellington avalanche and railway disaster. In: Disasters, Accidents, and Crises in American History: A Reference Guide to the Nation's Most Catastrophic Events. Infobase Publishing, 2008, p. 209. ==1910 avalanche== Wellington depot before the avalanche Train wreckage caused by the avalanche The Wellington avalanche was the deadliest avalanche in the history of the United States, marked by the total death count of 96. For nine days at the end of February 1910, the Wellington area experienced a severe blizzard. Up to a foot (30 cm) of snow fell every hour, and, on the worst day, of snow fell. Two trains, a passenger train and a mail train, both bound from Spokane to Seattle, were trapped in the depot. Snow plows were present at Wellington and others were sent to help, but they could not penetrate the snow accumulations and repeated avalanches along the stretch of tracks between Scenic and Leavenworth. Late on February 28, the snow stopped and was replaced by rain and a warm wind. Just after 1 a.m. on March 1, as a result of a lightning strike, a slab of snow broke loose from the side of Windy Mountain during a thunderstorm. A ten-foot high mass of snow, half a mile long and a quarter of a mile wide, fell toward the town. A forest fire had recently ravaged the slopes above the town, leaving very little to impede the avalanche. The avalanche missed the Bailets Hotel (which also housed the town's general store and post office), but hit the railroad depot. Most of the passengers and crew were asleep aboard their trains. The impact threw the trains downhill and into the Tye River valley. Ninety-six people were killed, including 35 passengers, 58 Great Northern employees on the trains, and three railroad employees in the depot. Twenty-three people survived; they were pulled from the wreckage by railroad employees who immediately rushed from the hotel and other buildings where they had been staying. However, the work was then abandoned because of the adverse weather conditions, and it was not until 21 weeks later (late July) that the last of the bodies were retrieved. This was not the only avalanche in the region that winter. Three days later, 63 railroad workers were killed in an avalanche nearby in British Columbia. == Aftermath == Wellington was quietly renamed \\"Tye\\" during October because of the unpleasant associations of the old name. In the same month, the Great Northern Railway began construction of concrete snow sheds to shelter the nearby tracks. The depot was closed when the second Cascade Tunnel was completed in 1929; the town was then abandoned and it eventually burned. The old track and snow sheds remain and have been preserved as part of the Iron Goat Trail, which is accessible easily from U.S. Highway 2 near Stevens Pass or near Scenic, east of Everett. ==See also== *1910 Rogers Pass avalanche *Frank Slide ==References== *Martin Burwash,Vis Major Railroad Men, an Act of God--White Death at Wellington iUniverse, 2009 *Cascade Division: A Pictorial Essay of the Burlington Northern and Milwaukee Road in the Washington Cascades, Fox Publications, 1995 *Lee Davis, Encyclopedia of Natural Disasters, Headline, 1992 *Gary Krist, The White Cascade: The Great Northern Railway Disaster and America's Deadliest Avalanche, Holt, 2007 *T.

The sister school is Eunice High School (Bloemfontein). Grey College was ranked 1st out of the top 100 best high schools in Africa by Africa Almanac in 2003 and 2013, based upon quality of education, student engagement, strength and activities of alumni, school profile, internet and news visibility. ==History== Grey College was founded on 13 October 1855 when Sir George Grey, the then Governor of the Cape Colony, paid a visit to the Orange Free State Republic and donated a sum of money towards the establishment of a school in Bloemfontein. The foundation stone was laid by Jacobus Nicolaas Boshoff, the second President of the Orange Free State Republic, on 13 October 1856. The school was officially opened on 17 January 1859 and the first headmaster was the Reverend Andrew Murray. It is the third-oldest school in South Africa and the oldest north of the Orange River. During his presidential inauguration speech in 1896, while addressing learners from Grey College, Marthinus Theunis Steyn mentioned that he envisioned a university for Bloemfontein where youth from all over the country could come and study. He supported the idea that Grey College should provide higher education to the people of the Orange Free State. As a result the University of the Free State essentially came into existence in 1904 when a tertiary portion of Grey College were allocated for such purpose.Marthinus Theunis Steyn, regsman staatsman en volksman, M.C.E. van Schoor, Protea Boekhuis Pretoria 2009, p. 87 The college first accepted matriculants for a full B.A. course in 1904. In 1906 the tertiary part of Grey College became known as the Grey University College (GUC), but shortly thereafter the school and college separated. GUC grew and evolved into the institution now called the University of the Free State. Afrikaans- and English-speaking pupils study under one roof, but each language group is educated in separate classrooms and in its own mother tongue. ==Grey College today== The school grounds consist of a number of historic buildings, of which five are Free State provincial heritage sites: the Main building and Hamilton Hall, the Andrew Murray House, the Brill House and the Tuck shop. Extensive sport facilities includes an Olympic-sized swimming pool, a hockey astro, squash courts and several hockey, soccer, cricket and rugby fields. The school also has 16 all-weather tennis courts. The school celebrated its 150th jubilee during October 2005, when numerous alumni visited their alma mater. The current headmaster at the High School is Deon Scheepers and the headmaster of the Primary School is Jurie Geldenhuys. A Museum which houses memorable artifacts, such as old rugby jerseys, and paintings, was unveiled in 2005. Each year on 13 October many old-boys hold a reunion. In 2001 the school won the Sanix World Rugby Youth Tournament. A trademark of the school is the unique handshake, widely recognized and used by students, old boys and members of staff. The school offers a number of scholarships such as the Badawi Legacy scholarship given in partnership with Montpellier Rugby Club to promote rugby, education and French culture. Old Greys donate funds to the Jock Meiring Trust and Bram Fisher Trust, funds used for the administration of school grounds and granting of scholarships.. ==Sports== Grey College has been performing very well on sports during the year. * Athletics * Cricket * Cross Country * Cycling * Football * Golf * Hockey * Rowing * Rugby * Softball * Shooting * Squash * Swimming * Table tennis * Tennis * Water polo ==Gallery== Image:Grey College.JPGMain Building Image:Tuck Shop.jpgThe Tuck Shop Image:Hamilton Hall, Grey College - panoramio.jpgHamilton Hall ==Notable alumni== *Laurens van der Post Sir Laurens van der Post was political adviser to British heads of government, close friend of Prince Charles, godfather of Prince William, educator, journalist, humanitarian, philosopher, explorer and conservationist. *Prof. Ernst Oswald Johannes Westphal, internationally renowned linguist and scholar, of the School of Oriental and African Studies and the University of Cape Town. *Jopie Fourie, military scout & dispatch rider * Etienne Leroux, Influential Afrikaans author and a key member of the South African Sestigers literary movement. *Charl du Plessis, Internationally renowned pianist. * Louis Brabow, Springboks rugby player. * Heinrich Brüssow, Springboks rugby player * Hansie Cronjé, former South African cricket captain, whose ashes are kept at the school * Johan Cronjé, South African Olympic Athlete * Breda van Reenen, world's famous cutting horse trainer * Naka Drotské, Rugby World Cup 1995 winning Springboks team * Bismarck du Plessis, Springboks rugby player * Jannie du Plessis, Springboks rugby player;

This lowland species occurs in various semi-open wooded habitats, e.g. mangrove, secondary forest, plantations and scrub. In Trinidad it also occurs in rainforest. It is fairly common in most of its range, and therefore listed as Least Concern by BirdLife International. Previously, several other small hermits were considered subspecies of this species. This includes the stripe-throated hermit (P. striigularis) of Central America and north-western South America, the minute hermit (P. idaliae) of south-eastern Brazil, the Tapajós hermit (P. aethopyga) of south-eastern Amazonia, and the black-throated hermit (P. atrimentalis) of western Amazonia. As presently defined, the little hermit is monotypic. It is among the smallest hummingbirds and birds overall with a total length of ca. 9 cm. (3½ in) and a weight of 2½-3½ g. (0,08-0,12 oz).Wood, The Guinness Book of Animal Facts and Feats. Sterling Pub Co Inc. (1983), It is olive-green above with orange-ochraceous uppertail coverts and underparts (the belly often is greyer). As most other hermits, it has a long decurved bill, elongated central rectrices with whitish tips and a blackish mask bordered by a whitish-buff malar and supercilium. The upper mandible is black, the lower is yellow with a black tip. The male has a slightly darker throat than the female. The males form communal leks where they sing and flash their tails to attract the females. The song varies over its range, but typically is high, squeaky, complex and repeated again and again. The little hermit lays two eggs in a conical nest suspended under a large leaf. Incubation and fledging period not reported, but probably as relatives where incubations is 14–16 days, and fledging another 20–23 days. The food of this species is nectar, taken from a wide variety of flowers (e.g. Heliconia), and some small insects. It feeds mainly by trap-lining. ==References== * Birds of Venezuela by Hilty, . * * Hinkelmann, C. (1999).

The album's first big hit, \\"Basement Apt.\\", had previously been a Weeping Tile song, appearing on that band's 1995 release eepee. Harmer also had a hit with \\"Don't Get Your Back Up\\", which she had previously recorded with The Saddletramps. Three other songs, \\"Weakened State\\", \\"Lodestar\\" and \\"Coffee Stain\\", had also been previously recorded by Weeping Tile, on 1998's This Great Black Night. Harmer stated \\"I always had kind of high expectations for You Were Here, but I was holding onto it for as long as I could, to find a proper, appropriate home.\\" She self-financed and self-released the album on her own Cold Snap Records label before it was licensed by Zoë Records and Universal Music Canada. Harmer appeared in support of the album on the Late Show with David Letterman on October 2, 2001, in an appearance in which stage manager Biff Henderson jumped in to sing impromptu backing vocals. She had originally been scheduled to appear the previous week, but was bumped when Rudy Giuliani's first post-9/11 appearance ran overtime.\\"Harmer invited to play two late-night talk shows\\", Jam!, October 18, 2001.

TIME ranked You Were Here in its year-end Top Ten list, calling it the year's best debut album. You Were Here was named the 24th greatest Canadian album of all time in Bob Mersereau's 2007 book The Top 100 Canadian Albums. Music critic Lisa M. Smith, writing for Allmusic, praised the album, and wrote of Harmer that \\"it is certain that she is an artist choosing wisely from a great scope of colors. With a pleasing and misleading start, the rollicking opening track asserts its individuality with a Vaudevillian clarinet, keeping one foot in Kinks pop and one in some elusive species of country rock.\\" She describes the album as one of a pleasing ebb and flow. \\"Songs may begin with a soft acoustic, then unfold assuredly toward their climax.

The hemagglutination assay or haemagglutination assay (HA) and the hemagglutination inhibition assay (HI or HAI) were developed in 1941–42 by American virologist George Hirst as methods for quantifying the relative concentration of viruses, bacteria, or antibodies. HA and HI apply the process of hemagglutination, in which sialic acid receptors on the surface of red blood cells (RBCs) bind to the hemagglutinin glycoprotein found on the surface of influenza virus (and several other viruses) and create a network, or lattice structure, of interconnected RBC's and virus particles. The agglutinated lattice maintains the RBC's in a suspended distribution, typically viewed as a diffuse reddish solution. The formation of the lattice depends on the concentrations of the virus and RBC's, and when the relative virus concentration is too low, the RBC's are not constrained by the lattice and settle to the bottom of the well. Hemagglutination is observed in the presence of staphylococci, vibrios, and other bacterial species, similar to the mechanism viruses use to cause agglutination of erythrocytes. The RBC's used in HA and HI assays are typically from chickens, turkeys, horses, guinea pigs, or humans depending on the selectivity of the targeted virus or bacterium and the associated surface receptors on the RBC. ==Procedure== A general procedure for HA is as follows, a serial dilution of virus is prepared across the rows in a U or V- bottom shaped 96-well microtiter plate. The most concentrated sample in the first well is often diluted to be 1/5x of the stock, and subsequent wells are typically two-fold dilutions (1/10, 1/20, 1/40, etc.). The final well serves as a negative control with no virus. Each row of the plate typically has a different virus and the same pattern of dilutions. After serial dilutions, a standardized concentration of RBCs is added to each well and mixed gently. The plate is incubated for 30 minutes at room temperature. Following the incubation period, the assay can be analyzed to distinguish between agglutinated and non-agglutinated wells. The images across a row will typically progress from agglutinated wells with high virus concentration and a diffuse reddish appearance to a series of wells with low virus concentrations containing a dark red pellet, or button, in the center of the well. The low concentration wells appear nearly identical to the no-virus negative control well. The button appearance occurs because the RBC's are not held in the agglutinated lattice structure and settle into the low point of the U or V-bottom well. The transition from agglutinated to non-agglutinated wells occurs distinctively, within 1 to 2 wells. The relative concentration, or titer, of the virus sample is based on the well with the last agglutinated appearance, immediately before a pellet is observed. Relative to the initial viral stock concentration, the virus concentration in this well will be some dilution of the stock, for example, 1/40-fold. The titer value of that sample is the inverse of the dilution, i.e., 40. In some cases, the virus is initially so dilute that agglutinated wells are never observed. In that case, the titer of these samples is commonly assigned as 5, indicating the highest possible concentration, but the accuracy of that value is clearly low. Alternatively, if the relative concentration of the virus is extremely high and the wells never transition to a button appearance. The titer value is then commonly assigned to be the highest dilution, such as 5120. HI is closely related to the HA assay, but includes anti-viral antibodies as “inhibitors” to interfere with the virus-RBC interaction. The goal is to characterize the concentration of antibodies in the antiserum or other samples containing antibodies. The HI assay is generally performed by creating a dilution series of antiserum across the rows of a 96-well microtiter plate. Each row would usually be a different sample. A standardized amount of virus or bacteria is added to each well, and the mixture is allowed to incubate at room temperature for 30 minutes. The last well in each row would be a negative control with no virus added. During the incubation, antibodies bind to the viral particles, and if the concentration and binding affinity of the antibodies are high enough, the viral particles are effectively blocked from causing hemagglutination. Next, a standardized amount of RBCs is added to each well and allowed to incubate at room temperature for an additional 30 minutes. The resulting HI plate images usually progress from non-agglutinated, “button” wells with high antibody concentration to agglutinated, red diffuse wells with low antibody concentration. The HI titer value is the inverse of the last dilution of serum that completely inhibited hemagglutination. The preceding descriptions of the HA and HI processes are generalized, and specific details can vary depending on the operator and laboratory. For example, serial dilutions across the rows is described, but some laboratories use an alternate orientation and perform dilutions down the columns instead. Similarly, the starting dilution, serial dilution factor, incubation times, and choice of U or V-bottom plate can depend on the specific laboratory. ==Advantages== HA and HI have the advantages that the assays are simple, use relatively inexpensive and available instruments and supplies, and provide results within a few hours. The assays are also well established in many laboratories around the world, allowing some measure of credibility, comparison, and standardization. ==Limitations== Optimal and reliable results require controlling several variables, such as incubation times, red blood cell concentration, and type of red blood cell. Non-specific factors in the sample can lead to interference and incorrect titer values. For example, molecules in the sample other than virus-specific antibodies can inhibit agglutination between virus and RBC's, as well as potentially blocking antibody from binding to virus. Receptor- destroying enzymes (RDE) are commonly used to treat samples prior to analysis to prevent non-specific inhibition. Analysis of the HA or HI results relies on a qualified individual to read the plate and determine the titer values. The manual interpretation method introduces more opportunities for discrepancies in the assay because results can be subjective and the agreement between human readers is inconsistent. Also, there is no digital record of the plate or titer determinations so the initial interpretation is tedious and commonly done in replicates. The range of potential variables and differences between expert readers can make comparing inter-laboratory results difficult. ==See also== * Hemagglutination * Virus quantification ==References== Category:Virology Category:Microbiology ","title":"Hemagglutination assay"},{"id":"1284642","text":"Wamsutta Oil Refinery was established around 1861 in McClintocksville in Venango County near Oil City, Pennsylvania, in the United States. It was the first business enterprise of Henry Huttleston Rogers (1840–1909), who became a famous businessman, industrialist and financier. == Whale oil and petroleum compete == Prior to the second half of the 19th century, whale oil was the primary source of fuel for lighting in the United States. The whalingindustry was the mainstay for many New England coastal communities for over 200 years. Among these was Fairhaven, Massachusetts, founded on land purchased by English settlers of the Plymouth Colony from an Indian chief and his son, who was named Wamsutta. In 1854, natural oil (petroleum) was discovered in western Pennsylvania. In 1859, George Bissell and Edwin L. Drake made the first successful use of a drilling rig at Titusville, Pennsylvania. This single well soon exceeded the entire cumulative oil output which had taken place in Europe since the 1650s. The principal product of the oil was kerosene. Another related product was natural gas. Kerosene and natural gas soon replaced whale oil in North America. In New England, whaling reached its peak in 1857, then gradually began a period of decline. The situation was aggravated considerably by the American Civil War, as whaling vessels and crews were diverted to assist in blockading the Confederate coastal areas and ports. By 1900, the whaling industry had collapsed, due in part to the discovery and refining of petroleum from the western Pennsylvania oil fields. == Henry H. Rogers == Perhaps realizing both the trend and opportunity, in 1861, in Fairhaven, 21-year-old Henry Huttleston Rogers pooled his savings of approximately $600 with a friend, Charles H. Ellis. They set out to western Pennsylvania and its newly discovered oil fields. The young partners began their small Wamsutta Oil Refinery at McClintocksville, Pennsylvania, near Oil City. The name \\"Wamsutta\\" was apparently selected in honor of their hometown area of Fairhaven, Massachusetts, in New England. Wamsutta was the son of a Native American chief who negotiated an early alliance with the English settlers of the Plymouth Colony in the 17th century. The name chosen for the new refinery may also have derived from the Wamsutta Company in New Bedford, Massachusetts. Opened in 1846, it was a major employer. (The Wamsutta Company was the first of many textile mills that gradually came to supplant whaling as the principal employer in New Bedford). Rogers and Ellis, and their Wamsutta Oil Refinery, made $30,000 their first year. This amount was more than 3 entire whaling ship trips from back home could hope to earn during an average voyage of more than a year's duration. He was regarded as very successful when Rogers returned home to Fairhaven for a short vacation the next year. There, in 1862, he married his childhood sweetheart, Abbie Palmer Gifford. Abbie returned with him to the oil fields where they lived in a one-room shack along Oil Creek, and he and Ellis worked the Wamsutta Oil Refinery. == Charles Pratt == Rogers met Charles Pratt a short time later. Pratt (1830–1891) had been born in Watertown, Massachusetts. In nearby Boston, he had joined a company specializing in paints and whale oil products. In 1850 or 1851, Pratt came to New York City, where he worked for a similar company handling paint and oil. Charles Pratt had seen the same trend as Ellis and Rogers and became a pioneer of the natural oil (petroleum) industry. He established a kerosene refinery Astral Oil Works in Brooklyn, New York. Pratt's product later gave rise to the slogan, The holy lamps of Tibet are primed with Astral Oil. In Pennsylvania in the mid-1860s, Pratt met Ellis and Rogers. Pratt had earlier bought whale-oil from Ellis in Fairhaven. The two young men agreed to sell the entire output of their small refinery to Pratt's company at a fixed price. Ellis and Rogers had no wells and were dependent upon purchasing crude oil to refine and sell to Pratt. A few months later, crude oil prices suddenly increased due to manipulation by speculators. The young entrepreneurs struggled to try to live up to their contract with Pratt, but soon their surplus was wiped out. Before long, they were heavily in debt to Pratt. Charles Ellis gave up, but in 1866, Rogers went to Pratt in New York City, and told him he would take personal responsibility for the entire debt. This so impressed Pratt that he hired 26-year-old Rogers immediately. In the next few years Rogers became, in the words of Elbert Hubbard, Pratt's \\"hands and feet and eyes and ears\\" (Little Journeys to the Homes, 1909). The following year, in 1867, Charles Pratt joined with his protégé Rogers to form Charles Pratt and Company. == Standard Oil, Henry Rogers as a tycoon and philanthropist == Pratt's companies (and he and Rogers) became part of John D. Rockefeller's Standard Oil in 1874. After joining Standard Oil, Rogers invested heavily in various industries, including copper, steel, mining, and railways. The Virginian Railway is widely considered his final life's achievement. Rogers amassed a great fortune, estimated at over $100 million, and became one of the wealthiest men in the United States. He was also a generous philanthropist, providing many public works for his hometown of Fairhaven and financially assisting such notables as Mark Twain, Helen Keller, and Booker T. Washington. == Pennsylvania oil heritage == Near McClintocksville and Oil City, in western Pennsylvania, Oil Creek State Park and many heritage sites to tell the story and memorialize the people of the oil boom of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. ==See also== *Henry H.

The Golden Hawks originally had eight pilots led by Squadron Leader Fern Villeneuve, but the Golden Hawks were so popular after their 1959 show season that the team was re-established for 1960. The team, under the command of W/C Jack Allan, and the lead of S/L Villeneuve, included pilots: F/L James McCombe, F/L Edward Rozdeba, F/L Jeb Kerr, F/L Ralph Annis, F/L Sam Eisler, F/O Jim Holt and F/O William (Bill) Stewart.Mummery 1984, p. 8. In 1961, F/L McCombe became the leader of the team, as Villeneuve left the team when he married.Dempsey 2002, p. 157. Two deaths altered the makeup of the team: F/O John T. Price joined the Hawks in 1959 after F/O Eisler died, and served as second solo.Dempsey 2002, p. 154. When F/L Kerr died in a crash in Calgary, F/O John T. Price moved to lead solo. F/O Stewart's routine as lead solo was often the one most remembered since his low-level aerobatics looked to the crowd to be particularly dangerous.Dempsey 2002, pp. 160–162. The Golden Hawks continued performing for three more seasons until they were disbanded, ostensibly for financial reasons, on February 7, 1964, having flown a total of 317 shows across North America. Not only did the team perform standard loops and rolls in very tight formation, they also introduced their own trademark maneuvers. The Golden Hawks pioneered a two-aircraft head-on coordinated solo program which virtually every military team since has adopted in various ways. They also invented the Card 5 Maneuver, where five aircraft fly in a card formation, two up front, one in the middle, two in the back. They also created the Coordinated Two Aircraft 360, where two aircraft fly in opposite directions at low level at about 350 miles an hour, at about seven gravities, in a horizontal circle and pass each other on both sides of the circle. The legacy of the Golden Hawks lives on with the Canadian Forces Snowbirds.Dempsey 2002 p. 160. ==Accidents and incidents== * 12 March 1959: A Golden Hawks Sabre crashed into a wooded area near RCAF Station Chatham while practising a co- solo routine, killing F/L Sam Eisler. * 10 August 1959: A Golden Hawks Sabre landing at McCall Airfield, Calgary, Alberta, with the rest of the team collided with a Piper Pacer while turning base leg about two miles west of the field.

It is classified as a primary immunodeficiency disorder, and is caused by a mutation in the myeloperoxidase gene on chromosome 17q23. Between 1:1000 and 1:4000 of people in the United States and Europe are myeloperoxidase-deficient. It can appear similar to chronic granulomatous disease on some screening tests. == Pathophysiology == In a person’s innate immune system, cells such as neutrophils and macrophages remove bacteria from the body by phagocytizing them. Once engulfed, the phagocytic cells must then degrade the captured bacteria, which is done via reactive oxygen species produced by the cell’s respiratory burst. One of these reactive oxygen species is hypochlorite, which is created by the myeloperoxidase-catalyzed conversion of hydrogen peroxide and chlorine ions. In a patient with MPO deficiency, the reaction cannot be catalyzed and hypochlorite will not be produced, rendering the neutrophils less capable of destroying certain bacterial and fungal species. ==Presentation== MPO deficiency classically presents with immune deficiency. Due to the decrease in reactive oxygen species, people with MPO may experience an increase in recurrent fungal infections, particularly candida albicans. However, the majority of MPO-deficient patients do not display any significant tendencies towards chronic infections from most other bacteria, perhaps due to increased activity in other aspects of the innate immune system, which compensate for the lack of HClO. == Diagnosis == Myeloperoxidase deficiency can be diagnosed via flow cytometry or cytochemical stains. Notably, MPO deficiency can present a false positive in the diagnosis of chronic granulomatous disease via DHR test. Although the two disorders are similar in that both interfere with the granulocyte’s ability to produce reactive oxygen species, CGD is caused by defects in the enzyme NADPH oxidase. NADPH oxidase- specific protein flow assays can be used to differentiate MPO deficiency from CGD. In addition, neutrophils which are MPO- but not NADPH oxidase-deficient will still turn blue in a normal nitro blue tetrazolium test because they still have NADPH oxidase activity, but do not form HClO (bleach) due to their lack of myeloperoxidase activity. This is in contrast to chronic granulomatous disease, in which the NBT test is 'negative' due to the lack of NADPH oxidase activity (positive test result means neutrophils turn blue, negative means nitroblue tetrazolium remains yellow). ==Treatment== MPO deficiency can technically be treated by the transplant of hemipotent stem cells from an unaffected patient to an MPO-deficient one. However, the symptoms of MPO deficiency are not severe and possibly unnoticeable, as determined by the realization in 1981 that far more of the population is MPO deficient than previously suspected. Therefore, treatment is usually unnecessary. The fungal infections which may occur as a result of MPO deficiency may be treated with antibiotics. == References == == External links == Category:Enzyme defects Category:Congenital defects of phagocyte number, function, or both Category:Noninfectious immunodeficiency-related cutaneous conditions ","title":"Myeloperoxidase deficiency"},{"id":"1284657","text":"France Football is a French weekly magazine containing football news from all over the world.

They are also sometimes used to treat excess hair growth in women and as a component of hormone therapy for transgender women. These agents inhibit the enzyme 5α-reductase, which is involved in the metabolic transformations of a variety of endogenous steroids. 5-ARIs are most known for preventing conversion of testosterone, the major androgen sex hormone, to the more potent androgen dihydrotestosterone (DHT), in certain androgen-associated disorders. ==Medical uses== 5-ARIs are clinically used in the treatment of conditions that are exacerbated by DHT:Rossi S (Ed.) (2004). Australian Medicines Handbook 2004. Adelaide: Australian Medicines Handbook. * Mild-to-moderate benign prostatic hyperplasia and lower urinary tract symptoms * Pattern hair loss in both men and women 5-ARIs can be used in the treatment of hirsutism in women. The usefulness of 5-ARIs for the potential treatment of acne is uncertain. 5-ARIs are sometimes used as antiandrogens in feminizing hormone therapy for transgender women to help reduce body hair growth and scalp hair loss. They have also been explored in the treatment and prevention of prostate cancer. While the 5-ARI finasteride reduces the cancer risk by about a third, it also increases the fraction of aggressive forms of prostate cancer. Overall, there does not seem to be a survival benefit for prostate cancer patients under finasteride. ===Available forms=== Finasteride (brand names Proscar, Propecia) inhibits the function of two of the isoenzymes (types 2 and 3) of 5α-reductase. It decreases circulating DHT levels by up to about 70%. Dutasteride (brand name Avodart) inhibits all three 5α-reductase isoenzymes and can decrease DHT levels by 95%. It can also reduce DHT levels in the prostate by 97 to 99% in men with prostate cancer.G. L. Andriole, P. Humphrey, P. Ray et al., \\"Effect of the dual 5α-reductase inhibitor dutasteride on markers of tumor regression in prostate cancer,\\" Epristeride (brand names Aipuliete, Chuanliu) is marketed in China for the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia.http://adisinsight.springer.com/drugs/800002533https://www.drugs.com/international/epristeride.html However, it can only decrease circulating DHT levels by about 25 to 54%. Alfatradiol (brand names Ell-Cranell Alpha, Pantostin) is a topical 5-ARI used to treat pattern hair loss in Europe. An extract of Serenoa repens, also known as saw palmetto extract, is a 5-ARI that is sold as an over-the-counter dietary supplement. It is also used under the brand name Permixon in Europe as a pharmaceutical drug for the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia. ==Side effects== 5-ARIs are generally well tolerated in both men and women and produce few side effects. However, they have been found to have some risks in studies with men, including slightly increased risks of decreased libido, erectile dysfunction, ejaculatory dysfunction, infertility, breast tenderness, gynecomastia, depression, anxiety, self-harm, and dementia. In addition, while 5-ARIs decrease the overall risk of developing prostate cancer, they have been found to increase the risk of developing certain rare but high-grade forms of prostate cancer. As a result, the FDA has notified healthcare professionals that the Warnings and Precautions section of the labels for the 5-ARI class of drugs has been revised to include new safety information about the increased risk of being diagnosed with these rare but more serious forms of prostate cancer. Finasteride has also been associated with intraoperative floppy iris syndrome and cataract formation. Depressive symptoms and suicidality has been reported. ===Sexual dysfunction=== Sexual dysfunction, including erectile dysfunction, loss of libido, and reduced ejaculate, may occur in 3.4 to 15.8% of men treated with finasteride or dutasteride. This is linked to lower quality of life and can cause stress in relationships. There is also an association with lowered sexual desire. It has been reported that in a subset of men, these adverse sexual side effects may persist even after discontinuation of finasteride or dutasteride. ===Breast changes=== 5-ARIs have a small risk of breast changes in men including breast tenderness and gynecomastia (breast development/enlargement). The risk of gynecomastia is about 2.8%. There is no association of 5-ARIs with male breast cancer. ===Emotional changes=== A 2017 population-based, matched-cohort study of 93,197 men aged 66 years and older with BPH found that finasteride and dutasteride were associated with a significantly increased risk of depression (, 1.94; 95% , 1.73–2.16) and self-harm (HR, 1.88; 95% CI, 1.34–2.64) during the first 18 months of treatment, but were not associated with an increased risk of suicide (HR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.53–1.45). After the initial 18 months of therapy, the risk of self-harm was no longer heightened, whereas the elevation in risk of depression lessened but remained marginally increased (HR, 1.22; 95% CI, 1.08–1.37). The absolute increase in the rate of depression was 247 per 100,000 patient-years and of self-harm was 17 per 100,000 patient-years. As such, on the basis of these findings, it has been stated that cases of depression in patients that are attributable to 5-ARIs will be encountered on occasion, while cases of self-harm attributable to 5-ARIs will be encountered very rarely. There were no differences in the rates of depression, self-harm, and suicide between finasteride and dutasteride, suggesting that the specific 5-ARI used does not influence the risks. The absolute risks of self-harm and depression with 5-ARIs remain low (0.14% and 2.0%, respectively). ==Pharmacology== The pharmacology of 5α-reductase inhibition is complex, but involves the binding of NADPH to the enzyme followed by the substrate. Specific substrates include testosterone, progesterone, androstenedione, epitestosterone, cortisol, aldosterone, and deoxycorticosterone. The entire physiologic effect of their reduction is unknown, but likely related to their excretion or is itself physiologic. 5α-Reductase reduces the steroid Δ4,5 double bond in testosterone to its more active form DHT. Thus, inhibition results in decreased amounts of DHT. Because of this, slight elevations in testosterone and estradiol levels occur. The 5α-reductase reaction is a rate- limiting step in the testosterone reduction and involves the binding of NADPH to the enzyme followed by the substrate. ::: Substrate + NADPH + H+ → 5α-substrate + NADP+ Beyond being a catalyst in the rate-limiting step in testosterone reduction, 5α-reductase isoforms I and II reduce progesterone to 5α-dihydroprogesterone (5α-DHP) and deoxycorticosterone to dihydrodeoxycorticosterone (DHDOC). In vitro and animal models suggest subsequent 3α-reduction of DHT, 5α-DHP and DHDOC lead to neurosteroid metabolites with effect on cerebral function. These neurosteroids, which include allopregnanolone, tetrahydrodeoxycorticosterone (THDOC), and 3α-androstanediol, act as potent positive allosteric modulators of GABAA receptors, and have antidepressant, anxiolytic, prosexual, and anticonvulsant effects. 5α-Dihydrocortisol is present in the aqueous humor of the eye, is synthesized in the lens, and might help make the aqueous humor itself. 5α-Dihydroaldosterone is a potent antinatriuretic agent, although different from aldosterone. Its formation in the kidney is enhanced by restriction of dietary salt, suggesting it may help retain sodium. 5α-DHP is a major hormone in circulation of normal cycling and pregnant women. Other enzymes compensate to a degree for the absent conversion of 5α-reductase, specifically with local expression at the skin of reductive 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, and oxidative 3α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase and 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase enzymes. In BPH, DHT acts as a potent cellular androgen and promotes prostate growth; therefore, it inhibits and alleviates symptoms of BPH. In alopecia, male and female-pattern baldness is an effect of androgenic receptor activation, so reducing levels of DHT also reduces hair loss. ==History== Finasteride was the first 5-ARI to be introduced for medical use. It was marketed for the treatment of BPH in 1992 and was subsequently approved for the treatment of pattern hair loss in 1997. Epristeride was the second 5-ARI to be introduced and was marketed for the treatment of BPH in China in 2000. Dutasteride was approved for the treatment of BPH in 2001 and was subsequently approved for pattern hair loss in South Korea in 2009 and in Japan in 2015. The patent protection on finasteride and dutasteride has expired and both drugs are available as generic medications.https://www.drugs.com/availability/generic-avodart.html ==Research== 5-ARIs have been studied in combination with the nonsteroidal antiandrogen bicalutamide for the treatment of prostate cancer. ==See also== * List of 5α-reductase inhibitors * Discovery and development of 5α-reductase inhibitors * CYP17A1 inhibitor * Neurosteroidogenesis inhibitor ==References== Category:Hair loss medications Category:Hair removal Category:Antiandrogens ","title":"5α-Reductase inhibitor"},{"id":"1284675","text":"Myeloperoxidase (MPO) is a peroxidase enzyme that in humans is encoded by the MPO gene on chromosome 17. MPO is most abundantly expressed in neutrophil granulocytes (a subtype of white blood cells), and produces hypohalous acids to carry out their antimicrobial activity. It is a lysosomal protein stored in azurophilic granules of the neutrophil and released into the extracellular space during degranulation. Neutrophil myeloperoxidase has a heme pigment, which causes its green color in secretions rich in neutrophils, such as pus and some forms of mucus. The green color contributed to its outdated name verdoperoxidase. == Structure == The 150-kDa MPO protein is a cationic homodimer consisting of two 15-kDa light chains and two variable-weight glycosylated heavy chains bound to a prosthetic heme group. The light chains are glycosylated and contain the modified iron protoporphyrin IX active site. Together, the light and heavy chains form two identical 73-kDa monomers connected by a cystine bridge at Cys153. The protein forms a deep crevice which holds the heme group at the bottom, as well as a hydrophobic pocket at the entrance to the distal heme cavity which carries out its catalytic activity. Three isoforms have been identified, differing only in the size of the heavy chains. One of the ligands is the carbonyl group of Asp 96. Calcium- binding is important for structure of the active site because of Asp 96's close proximity to the catalytic His95 side chain. == Function == MPO is a member of the XPO subfamily of peroxidases and produces hypochlorous acid (HOCl) from hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and chloride anion (Cl−) (or hypobromous acid if Br- is present) during the neutrophil's respiratory burst. It requires heme as a cofactor. Furthermore, it oxidizes tyrosine to tyrosyl radical using hydrogen peroxide as an oxidizing agent. Hypochlorous acid and tyrosyl radical are cytotoxic, so they are used by the neutrophil to kill bacteria and other pathogens. However, this hypochlorous acid may also cause oxidative damage in host tissue. Moreover, MPO oxidation of apoA-I reduces HDL-mediated inhibition of apoptosis and inflammation. In addition, MPO mediates protein nitrosylation and the formation of 3-chlorotyrosine and dityrosine crosslinks. == Clinical significance == Myeloperoxidase deficiency is a hereditary deficiency of the enzyme, which predisposes to immune deficiency. Antibodies against MPO have been implicated in various types of vasculitis, most prominently three clinically and pathologically recognized forms: granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA), microscopic polyangiitis (MPA); and eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA). Antibodies are also known as anti- neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCAs), though ANCAs have also been detected in staining of the perinuclear region. Recent studies have reported an association between elevated myeloperoxidase levels and the severity of coronary artery disease. And Heslop et al. reported that elevated MPO levels more than doubled the risk for cardiovascular mortality over a 13-year period. It has also been suggested that myeloperoxidase plays a significant role in the development of the atherosclerotic lesion and rendering plaques unstable. === Medical uses === An initial 2003 study suggested that MPO could serve as a sensitive predictor for myocardial infarction in patients presenting with chest pain. Since then, there have been over 100 published studies documenting the utility of MPO testing. The 2010 Heslop et al. study reported that measuring both MPO and CRP (C-reactive protein; a general and cardiac-related marker of inflammation) provided added benefit for risk prediction than just measuring CRP alone. Immunohistochemical staining for myeloperoxidase used to be administered in the diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia to demonstrate that the leukemic cells were derived from the myeloid lineage. Myeloperoxidase staining is still important in the diagnosis of myeloid sarcoma, contrasting with the negative staining of lymphomas, which can otherwise have a similar appearance. In the case of screening patients for vasculitis, flow cytometric assays have demonstrated comparable sensitivity to immunofluorescence tests, with the additional benefit of simultaneous detection of multiple autoantibodies relevant to vasculitis. Nonetheless, this method still requires further testing. Myeloperoxidase is the first and so far only human enzyme known to break down carbon nanotubes, allaying a concern among clinicians that using nanotubes for targeted delivery of medicines would lead to an unhealthy buildup of nanotubes in tissues. === Inhibitors of MPO === Azide has been used traditionally as an MPO inhibitor, but 4-aminobenzoic acid hydrazide (4-ABH) is a more specific inhibitor of MPO. == See also == * Chloroma == References == ==External links== * Category:EC 1.11.1 Category:Hemoproteins ","title":"Myeloperoxidase"},{"id":"1284683","text":"The M-87 Orkan is a Yugoslavia fully automated self-propelled multiple rocket launcher. The generic M-87 project was configured with 12 launch tubes mounted on a FAP 2832 truck. It has a range of about 50 to 120 km, with the ability to deliver warheads, anti-tank and anti-personnel mines. The production of Orkan M-87 ceased in the early 1990s due to break-up of Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. ==History== Development started as a joint SFRY and Iraqi project under the name of KOL-15 with professor Obrad Vučurović as concept designer and chief engineer on projecthttp://www.vti.mod.gov.rs/fs/155/155.htm. In early talks with Iraq, Yugoslavia offered two options: *Development of a MRL with 12 barrels and a 50 km range *Development of a MRL with 4 barrels and a 120 km range Iraq chose the first option as did Yugoslavia. At the start of development two prototypes were built: one for Yugoslavia and one for Iraq. In accordance with requests from purchasers rockets were developed with cluster warheads. According to the chief operating officer of the Artillery department of Military Technical Institute Belgrade Professor Obrad Vučurović, Orkan was never a copy of any previous designs. The Yugoslav doctrine when developing the system was based on the premise that countries who copy designs are at least five years behind those who have the weapons developed. ==Characteristics== One battery of M-87 Orkans consist of: *four 8×8 launchers *four 8×8 resupply vehicles (each with 24 rockets) *one 8×8 command post vehicle *two 4×4 topographic survey light vehicles *two 4×4 observation post light vehicles *one 4×4 meteorological survey vehicle The FAP 2832 vehicle with its base platform is fitted with a central tyre pressure regulation system which is operated by the driver from within the cab, and to provide a more stable firing platform four stabilisers are lowered to the ground by remote control one at either side to the rear of the second roadwheel and two at the very rear. When travelling, the launcher is traversed to the front and the whole launcher is covered by a tarpaulin cover with integral bows. ===Rockets=== The rocket is 4.6 metres long and it is packed in a glass-ceramic housing and transported by the vehicle. Rockets are re-loaded by the FAP 3232 with a built-in crane. The rocket speed is 1000 m/s. Rockets with extended range are 4.88 m long and weigh 404 kg. A battery of 4 launchers with 16 barrels and 192 rockets can cover a target area of 3–4 km². The following types of rockets are known: *M-87-APHE with a fragmentation warhead to 91 kg. Range 50 km. *M-87-APHE-ER with a fragmentation warhead to 91 kg. Range 65 km. *M-87-PFHE-ER pre-fragmented warhead containing double- size balls. Range 65 km. *M-87-ICM-AT with 288 piece shaped charge bomblets type KB-2 . Range 50 km. *M-87-ICM AP with 420 piece splinter bomblets. Range 50 km. *M-87-AT with 24 piece YU-S-AT (KPOM) mines with Magnetos. Range 50 km. Some of the rockets are no longer in production. ===Features=== Unique features at the time of introduction (1987) when compared to other MRLs operational at the time include: * Ability to disperse anti-tank or anti- personnel mines up to 50 km from the firing location. * Semi-automatic loading. * Preparations to fire take two minutes. * Automatic leveling. Automatic Leveling of weapon was very precise. The system has a TV camera corrector for correcting missile path. *Automatic barrel sight. *Hard chromed barrels without the need for cleaning. *Mines KB-2 with wings and parachutes with two fuses (magnetic and mechanism for self-destruction after 24 or up to 48 hours) According to Obrad Vučurović, Orkan's main feature was the ability to disperse anti-tank or anti-personnel mines from 5 to 50 km from the firing location. ==Modifications and versions== Orkan II in Partner 2011 military fairThere were a few modifications of Orkan M-87: * The first modification was made by Army of Republic of Srpska with two barrels placed on Luna R-65 launcher (ZIL-135). * FR Yugoslavia modified Krupp M-418/37 and placed two Orkan barrels on it. * Serbia developed the M-96 Orkan II modification. The simplest solution was to integrate four 262mm launch tubes on a ZIL-135 launcher as it required minimum investment. The basic purpose of these modified launchers can be restored. Newly developed rockets increased range of Orkan II to 65 km. * Orkan CER developed by Yugoimport SDPR based on KamAZ-6350. * Dominator M2/12 MLRS multi-caliber multiple launch rocket system developed by Yugoimport SDPR which uses 16 262mm Orkan rockets. ==Origins of TOROS artillery rocket system== In 1990s Turkey faced USA reluctance to share modern defense technology. In order to have domestic supply of multiple rocket launcher rockets and domestic launchers Turkey used reverse engineering and shortcuts in order to develop its own versions. In order to have a supply of 227mm rockets they reverse engineered M270 Multiple Launch Rocket System M26 rocket under project designation SAGE 227. For continuing work on development of domestic MRLS Turkey obtained Orkan M-87 documentation, launcher and rockets from Bosnia and Herzegovina Novi Travnik \\"Bratstvo\\" factory in 1995. They used them for development of a domestic 260mm rockets and launcher thus shortening development for more than 5 years. First launches of new 230 and 260mm rockets respectively based on 227 M26 and 262 Orkan rockets produced in Turkey from Orkan M-87 launcher were conducted in April 1999.http://www.bitav.org.tr/TR/pdf/TUBITAK_90lar_CGO_SOS.pdfhttp://rbase.new- factoria.ru/sites/default/files/gallery/s.gurov/11/01/14/toros_260a.jpg ==Operational history== Republic of Serbian Krajina used M-87 Orkan to retaliate after Croatian forces attacked United Nations Protected Areashttp://www.un.org/Depts/DPKO/Missions/unprof_b.htm where Serbs lived.Operation Flash#cite note-Štrbac 2005 225-102 ==Operators== Map with M-87 operators in blue and former operators in red ===Current operators=== * - 4 M-96 Orkan II ===Former operators=== * - 1 non-operational unit in Banja Luka, 1 completed and 3 partially assembled units destroyed along with rockets. * - 1 in reserve due to lack of adequate rocket ammunition, 1 in a museum * - 1 prototype and 4 Orkan launchers called \\"Ababeel 50\\" + 4 reload vehicles.

HVXC supports bit rates of 2 and 4 kbit/s in the fixed and variable bit rate mode and sampling frequency 8 kHz. It also operates at lower bitrates, such as 1.2 - 1.7 kbit/s, using a variable bit rate technique. The total algorithmic delay for the encoder and decoder is 36 ms. It was published as subpart 2 of ISO/IEC 14496-3:1999 (MPEG-4 Audio) in 1999. An extended version of HVXC was published in MPEG-4 Audio Version 2 (ISO/IEC 14496-3:1999/Amd 1:2000). MPEG-4 Natural Speech Coding Tool Set uses two algorithms: HVXC and CELP (Code Excited Linear Prediction). HVXC is used at a low bit rate of 2 or 4 kbit/s. Higher bitrates than 4 kbit/s in addition to 3.85 kbit/s are covered by CELP. ==Technology== ===Linear Predictive Coding=== HVXC uses Linear predictive coding (LPC) with block-wise adaptation every 20ms. The LPC parameters are transformed to Line spectral pair (LSP) coefficients, which are jointly quantized. The LPC residual signal is classified as either voiced or unvoiced. In the case of voiced speech, the residual is coded in a parametric representation (operating as a vocoder), while in the case of unvoiced speech, the residual waveform is quantized (thus operating as hybrid speech codec). ===Voiced (Harmonic) Residual Coding=== In voiced segments, the residual signal is represented by two parameters: the pitch period and the spectral envelope. The pitch period is estimated from the peak values of the autocorrelation of the residual signal. In this process, the residual signal is compared against shifted copies of itself, and the shift which yields the greatest similarity by measure of linear dependence is identified as the pitch period. The spectral envelope is represented by a set of amplitude values, one per harmonic. To extract these values, the LPC residual signal is transformed into the DFT-domain. The DFT-spectrum is segmented into bands, one band per harmonic. The frequency band for the m-th harmonic consists of the DFT-coefficients from (m-1/2)ω0 to (m+1/2)ω0, ω0 being the pitch frequency. The amplitude value for the m-th harmonic is chosen to optimally represent these DFT-coefficients. Phase information is discarded in this process. The spectral envelope is then coded using variable-dimension weighted vector quantization. This process is also referred to as Harmonic VQ. To make speech with a mixture of voiced and unvoiced excitation sound more natural and smooth, three different modes of voiced speech (Mixed Voiced-1, Mixed Voiced-2, Full Voiced) are differentiated. The degree of voicing is determined by the value of the normalized autocorrelation function at a shift of one pitch period. Depending on the chosen mode, different amounts of band- pass Gaussian noise are added to the synthesized harmonic signal by the decoder. ===Voiceless (VXC) Residual Coding=== Unvoiced segments are encoded according to the CELP scheme, which is also referred to as vector excitation coding (VXC). The CELP coding in HVXQ is performed using only a stochastic codebook. In other CELP codecs, a dynamic codebook is used additionally to perform long-term prediction of voiced segments. However, since HVXC does not use CELP for voiced segments, the dynamic codebook is omitted from the design. ==See also== * Opus (audio format) ==References== Category:MPEG-4 Category:Speech codecs ","title":"Harmonic Vector Excitation Coding"},{"id":"1284695","text":"The Târnava (fully , ; ; ) is a river in Romania.

He held ministerial office in the governments of Alfred Deakin and Stanley Bruce, serving as Minister for Defence (1903–1904), Postmaster-General (1905–1907), Minister for Trade and Customs (1907–1908, 1923–1924), and Minister for Health (1923–1924). ==Early life== Chapman was born on 10 July 1864 in Bong Bong, New South Wales. He was the son of Monica (née Cain; also spelt Kean or Kein) and Richard Chapman, his father being a wheelwright and publican. His mother was born in Ireland. His given name was spelled \\"Austen\\" until 1897. Chapman attended the state school in Marulan until the age of 14, when he was apprenticed to a saddler working in Goulburn and Mudgee. By 1885 he was operating Chapman's Hotel in Bungendore, close to the eventual site of Canberra. Chapman moved to Sydney in 1887 and went into partnership with Edward William O'Sullivan in an auctioneering firm, of which he was managing partner. He was also the proprietor of the Emu Inn on Bathurst Street. His partnership with O'Sullivan was dissolved in 1889, and he subsequently established the Royal Hotel in Braidwood. ==New South Wales politics== In 1894 he was elected to the New South Wales Legislative Assembly as MLA for Braidwood. Like most politicians from the southern border regions of New South Wales, he was an active supporter of federation of the Australian colonies. ==Federal politics== Chapman c. 1907/08 In 1901 Chapman was elected to the first House of Representatives as MP for the Division of Eden-Monaro (his brother Albert succeeded him as the member for Braidwood in the New South Wales Parliament). A Protectionist, he was Minister for Defence in the first ministry of Alfred Deakin (1903–04), Postmaster-General in the second Deakin ministry (1905–08), and Minister for Trade and Customs from 1907 to 1908. After a long period on the backbench as a result of a stroke in 1909, which paralysed one of his arms, he was appointed Minister for Trade and Customs and Minister for Health in the Bruce government in February 1923. He was criticised by both Nationalists and the Country Party and he resigned in May 1924 on the grounds of ill health and was subsequently made a . Chapman's most important contribution was his influence on the choice of the site of Australia's national capital, Canberra. He lobbied hard for the site on the Molonglo River near Queanbeyan, in his electorate. The success of his lobbying benefited many of his friends who owned land in the area, and also greatly boosted trade in Queanbeyan, the nearest town to the site. He was still MP for Eden-Monaro at the time of his death in Sydney of cerebro-vascular disease. He was survived by his wife, two daughters and two sons, James Austin Chapman and John Austin Chapman who both became distinguished soldiers. The Canberra suburb of Chapman was named after him. ==References== Category:1864 births Category:1926 deaths Category:Commonwealth Liberal Party members of the Parliament of Australia Category:Australian Knights Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George Category:Australian politicians awarded knighthoods Category:Protectionist Party members of the Parliament of Australia Category:Members of the Cabinet of Australia Category:Members of the Australian House of Representatives for Eden-Monaro Category:Members of the Australian House of Representatives Category:Australian federationists Category:Members of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly Category:People from Bowral Category:People from Sydney Category:Australian auctioneers Category:Nationalist Party of Australia members of the Parliament of Australia Category:Defence ministers of Australia Category:20th-century Australian politicians Category:People who died in office ","title":"Austin Chapman"},{"id":"1284721","text":"Bob Tomalski (7 February 1953 - 13 January 2001), was a journalist, \\"gadget guru\\", broadcaster and longtime proponent of radio broadcasting freedom. Tomalski was a technology journalist: he founded Home Cinema Choice magazine and contributed to many other magazines on the subjects of TV, video, satellite TV, mobile phones and camcorders. He also appeared regularly on Sky News' weekly Technofile programme, reviewing gadgets alongside presenter Martin Stanford. He was also a regular contributor to Media Network, a communications magazine on the English service of Radio Netherlands. Tomalski started his broadcasting career on the south west London pirate scene of the 1970s, where he became best known as the host of Roger Tate's Mailbox Show on European Music Radio, later becoming a licensed amateur radio operator with the call sign G6CQF. His maisonette in Mitcham, Surrey was equipped with a broadcast-quality mixing desk and two Nakamichi cassette decks, alongside the high-quality turntables. These were complemented by a collection of several thousand albums, mainly of his favourite genre; soul and funk, but topped up with many chart albums and a few hundred 60s and 70s rock records. He was also a collector of state of the art video equipment. He was a co-founder of Wandle Valley Radio (WVR) in 1984, still under the pseudonym \\"Roger Tate\\", broadcasting a soul/funk/hi-energy programme - he was a friend of the hi- energy artist Hazell Dean - alongside Alan Rogers and Paul James (both pseudonyms for obvious reasons). He provided the studio facilities for the station, which was amongst the pioneers of microwave links from the studio to the FM Band II transmitter, a technology later very widely used in pirate radio. Another technology which Tomalski pioneered was that of computer data transmission via Band II FM radio - raw data transmitted onto the audio signal with no subcarrier: WVR featured the \\"Roger Tate Computer Program Programme\\" with Tomalski introducing (after the music had ended for the night) half an hour of 8-bit data sounds played from a Nakamichi cassette deck, representing programs for the BBC Micro and the Tandy TRS-80 microcomputers, among others. Surprisingly, for such an innovation being broadcast into listeners homes late at night, the telephone and postal feedback on the programme was overwhelmingly positive; a tribute to Tomalski's broadcasting skills. His home studio was raided in the late 80s after alleged transmission offences, and the Home Office even went as far as confiscating his electric kettle (as well as the studio gear), on the grounds that it was connected to the same ring main as his transmitting equipment. In his subsequent radio career, Tomalski was a regular contributor to You and Yours and The Big Byte on BBC Radio. He also broadcast for Radio Mercury and Radio Invicta (which also sparked the career of Steve Walsh), and was the resident 'Inspector Gadget' on the LBC Weekend Wireless Show, talking about the week's technology news, reviewing gadgets and answering listener queries. ==External links== * Home Cinema Choice Category:1953 births Category:2001 deaths Category:British television presenters Category:British radio people Category:British reporters and correspondents Category:European amateur radio operators ","title":"Bob Tomalski"},{"id":"1284726","text":"Paradise in Distress is the twenty-third album by Dutch hard rock band Golden Earring, released in 1999 (see 1999 in music).

He is of the Owu subgroup of the Egba. ==Career== He began his professional career in the mid-1950s after moving to Lagos. After tutelage under Fatai Rolling-Dollar's band, he formed a band called The International Brothers in 1964, playing highlife-jùjú fusion. The band later metamorphosed into Inter-Reformers in the early-1970s, with a long list of Juju album hits on the West African Decca musical label. Obey began experimenting with Yoruba percussion style and expanding on the band by adding more drum kits, guitars and talking drums. Obey's musical strengths lie in weaving intricate Yoruba axioms into dance-floor compositions. As is characteristic of Nigerian Yoruba social-circle music, the Inter-Reformers band excel in praise-singing for rich Nigerian socialites and business tycoons. Obey, however, is also renowned for Christian spiritual themes in his music and has since the early-1990s retired into Nigerian gospel music ministry. It will be worthy of note to also say that Chief Commander just as he is fondly called by his fans, has played alongside popular gospel music veteran, Pastor Kunle Ajayi during his 30 years on stage concert in Lagos. ==Personal life== Obey married Juliana Olaide Olufade in 1963.

The members of Kemopetrol are the vocalist Laura Närhi, the drummer Teemu Nordman, the guitarist Marko Soukka and the keyboardist Kalle Koivisto, who also writes the songs for Kemopetrol. Kemopetrol's original bassist, Kari Myöhänen, left the band in July 2003. He was replaced by Lauri Hämäläinen who in turn left in 2008. All Kemopetrol songs have English lyrics. The name of the band originates from a Czech ice hockey team named Chemopetrol Litvínov. ==History== Marko Soukka and Kalle Koivisto founded Kemopetrol in November 1998, originally as an ambient music project. In December on the same year Koivisto met Laura Närhi at a party and later introduced her some songs he had written. Laura Närhi joined the band in January 1999, followed by drummer Teemu Nordman and bassist Kari Myöhänen later same year. The band went to studio in July. Kemopetrol’s first single Child Is My Name was released at the end of 1999 and was a breakthrough success. In 2000, their debut album Slowed Down was released. Slowed Down contains music that is a mixture of rock, jazz and electronic music. In 2001, a two-CD edition of the album Slowed Down was released. One CD is identical to the first release of Slowed Down, the other CD contains remixes and live performances. In addition to numerous gigs in Finland, the band also performed in Spain and Italy. In March 2002, the single Saw It on TV and, two months later, the album Everything’s Fine were released. In 2004, the single My Superstar and the album Play for Me were released. Having Kari left the band the previous year, on those releases, Kemopetrol's producer Kalle Chydenius plays bass. Shortly after the release of Play for Me, Lauri Hämäläinen joined the band as the new permanent bassist. The band's fourth album, Teleport was released on 29 March 2006, preceded by Planet-single on 8 March. The album features disco influences from the 80's, including notable usage of synthesizer sounds from that era. Laura Närhi also sings solo. She performs the song Se ei mee pois, which is found on the soundtrack of the movie Kuutamolla. She also provides the vocals for the Alimo&Control; song Tarkkaillaan. Both Se ei mee pois and Tarkkaillaan have Finnish lyrics (and Finnish titles). Her first solo album Suuri sydän was released in August 2010.Laura Närhi on musicbrainz.org The band started recording their fifth studio album in May 2008. Around this time, Lauri Hämäläinen left the band. In May 2010 the band announced that the recording of the album was on hold due to Laura's solo schedule. The fifth album, named A song & A Reason was released on 21 September 2011. ==Discography== ===Singles=== * Child Is My Name (1999) * Tomorrow (2000) * African Air (2000) * Disbelief (2000) * Saw It on TV (2002) * Goodbye (2002) * My Superstar (2004) * Planet (2006) * Already Home (2006) * Overweight & Underage (2006) * Changing Lanes (2011) ===Albums=== * Slowed Down (2000) * Slowed Down -- Special 2CD Edition (2001) * Everything’s Fine (2002) * Play For Me (2004) * Teleport (2006) * A Song & A Reason (2011) ==External links== *The official website of Kemopetrol *Kemopetrol in MySpace *Kemopetrol on Twitter *Music Export Finland - Midem 2006, music samples *Comprehensive Kemopetrol discography ==References== Category:Finnish musical groups ","title":"Kemopetrol"},{"id":"1284738","text":"This Great Black Night is a 1998 EP by Weeping Tile.

It was sold after the Romanian Revolution of 1989, and six years of service, to the Romanian private shipping company \\"Petromin\\", changing its name to M/T Iris Star. The ship was then bought by the Romanian shipping company Histria Shipmanagement having its name changed again to M/T Histria Crown, in 2005. In 2009, after an extensive refit in Keppel Shipyard (Singapore), the ship was converted into a FPSO (Floating production storage and offloading) and given a new name, Armada Perdana.Armada Perdana It was still in use of the coast of Nigeria (Oyo Oil Field), as of 2018. ==Incidents== On July 27, 2000, the ship lost power after an engine failure and drifted towards Kandilli point in Turkey. There was no extensive damage reported. ==Sister ships== M/T Biruința was the third of a series of five Romanian supertankers which were constructed by Constanța Shipyard in the 1980s. The sister ships were as follows: M/T Independența (Independence) – suffered a more deadly accident with a Greek ship (Evriyali) at the southern entrance to the Bosporus. All but three members of the Romanian tanker crew died. M/T Unirea (Union) – broke up and sank at the beginning of the 1980s in Bulgarian waters of the Black Sea. Official reports claim that the accident was caused by a collision with a World War II mine. A different opinion (unofficial) came from some naval architects and marine engineers stating that the ship broke up due to incorrect ballasting (the ship had no cargo at the moment of the accident). M/T Libertatea (Liberty) – had the same history (including ownership) as her older sister M/T Biruinta. The ship, known then as M/T Histria Prestige, was broken up in 2005. M/T Pacea (Peace) – was never fully completed. At the end of the 1980s it was passed to Czechoslovakia as a part of Romania's foreign debt. ==References== ==External links== * The Histria Crown on the site of the shipping company Histria.

It is a left tributary of the Oise. It gave its name to the French department of Aisne. It was known in the Roman period as Axona. The river rises in the forest of Argonne, at Rembercourt-Sommaisne, near Sainte-Menehould. It flows north and then west before joining the Oise near Compiègne. The Aisne is long. Its main tributaries are the Vesle, the Aire and the Suippe. The Battle of the Axona was fought near there between the Romans and the Belgae in 57 BC. Three Battles of the Aisne were fought in the Aisne valley during the First World War. ==Places along the river== Departments and towns along the river include: * Meuse * Marne: Sainte-Ménehould * Ardennes: Vouziers, Rethel * Aisne: Soissons * Oise: Compiègne * Aisne: Berny-Rivière ==Navigation== The river Aisne was a commercial navigation as early as the Gallo-Roman period, and rafts were floated from a long distance above the present limit of navigation at Vailly-sur-Aisne until the mid-19th century. Canalisation works were begun in 1836, at the same time as construction of the Canal lateral à l'Aisne. The canal was completed first, in 1841, then two years later the river navigation. Commercial traffic in péniches carrying 220 tonnes is still active, while recreational traffic is mainly private boats. The waterway is long, from the river Oise to the junction with the lateral canal, and has 7 locks.

Later, Lebedinskiy L.N. collected numerous folk songs in Bashkortostan beginning in 1930. The 1968 foundation of the Ufa State Institute of Arts sponsored research in the field. The quray is the most important instrument in the Bashkir ensemble; it is made from a special reed found only in the Ural Mountains. The National Symphonic Orchestra of the Bashkortostan Republic was founded in 1992 under the leadership of Tahir Kamalov. It emerged as one of the major symphonies in late 20th century Russia. G. Gaskarav, the first artistic leader of folk theatrical choreography of the Bashkir, founded a professional folk dance ensemble in 1939. This band has travelled across much of the world. Quray, the symbol of Bashkir music, is used in modern popular music too. Zahir Bayiq played some Enigma and own melodies (Quray-Dance CD).

It is a white solid that is soluble in most organic solvents. The compound is mainly used as a ligand in coordination chemistry. ==Synthesis== Terpyridine was first synthesized by G. Morgan and F. H. Burstall in 1932 by the oxidative coupling of pyridines. This method, however, proceeded in low yields. More efficient syntheses have since been described, mainly starting from 2-acetylpyridine. One method produces an enaminone by the reaction of 2-acetylpyridine with N,N-dimethylformamide dimethyl acetal. The base-catalyzed reaction of 2-acetylpyridine with carbon disulfide followed by alkylation with methyl iodide gives C5H4NCOCH=C(SMe)2. Condensation of this species with 2-acetylpyridine forms the related 1,5-diketone, which condenses with ammonium acetate to form a terpyridine. Treatment of this derivative with Raney nickel removes the thioether group. Other methods have been developed for the synthesis of terpyridine and its substituted derivatives.Kamata, K., Suzuki, A., Nakai, Y., Nakazawa, H., \\"Catalytic Hydrosilylation of Alkenes by Iron Complexes Containing Terpyridine Derivatives as Ancillary Ligands\\", Organometallics 2012, 31, 3825. Substituted terpyridines are also synthesized from palladium-catalyzed cross- coupling reactions. It can be prepared from bis-triazinyl pyridine. ==Properties== (Terpyridine)ruthenium trichloride is a representative complex of terpyridine. Terpyridine is a tridentate ligand that binds metals at three meridional sites giving two adjacent 5-membered MN2C2 chelate rings. Terpyridine forms complexes with most transition metal ion as do other polypyridine compounds, such as 2,2'-bipyridine and 1,10-phenanthroline. Complexes containing two terpyridine complexes, i.e. [M(Terpy)2]n+ are common. They differ structurally from the related [M(Bipy)3]n+ complexes in being achiral. Terpyridine complexes, like other polypyridine complexes, exhibit characteristic optical and electrochemical properties: metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT) in the visible region, reversible reduction and oxidation, and fairly intense luminescence. Because they are pi-acceptors, terpyridine and bipyridine tend to stabilize metals in lower oxidation states. For instance in acetonitrile solution, it is possible to generate the [M(Terpy)2]+ (M = Ni, Co). ==Related compounds== The bis-triazinyl pyridines are related to terpyridine in their binding to metals. ==See also== * Chelating ligand * Pincer ligand * Terthiophene ==References== Category:Chelating agents Category:Pyridines Category:Heterocyclic compounds (3 rings) ","title":"Terpyridine"},{"id":"1284764","text":"Tuva is a part of Russia, inhabited by a Turkic people. Tuvans are known abroad for khoomei (xöömej), a kind of overtone singing. Traditionally, Tuvan music was only a solo effort. The musician's intention was usually to emphasise timbre and harmonics over rhythm. Performances were often in places with good natural acoustics, such as caves, cliffs, and rivers, with the performer taking long pauses to allow nature the chance to converse back. Modern Tuvan music usually involves ensembles of musicians playing multiple instruments, and tends to be more pulsatile than traditional forms. ==Traditional songs== Tuvans' belief in spirits is apparent in their musical practices. Praise songs and chants, called algysh, and the rhythmically chanted poetic couplets that precede breaths of throat-singing, address cher eezi, or local-spirit masters with words. Throat singing is instead made to imitate sounds produced by the places or beings in which the spirit-masters dwell. Singers establish contact with the spirit-master by reproducing the sounds made and enter into conversation, whose aim is supplication, an expression of gratitude, or an appeal for protection. The same imitative or mimetic interaction with the natural sound world may also be mediated through the use of traditional musical instruments. Calm, mimetic singing in reproduction of the sounds of a certain place is believed to be the best possible offering to spirit-masters. This region is also famous for its indigenous shaman population. Shamans commonly created music in order to call upon spirits, conjure ancestors, discover birthplaces, connect with natural surroundings, and to attract spirits for hunters. Shepherds would also play music to herd animals and imitate galloping horses. Each song had a certain meaning according to where the musician was and whether or not the situation was work or relaxation. Many traditional Tuvan songs share the same structure. They may consist of several verses, each four lines long, with each line having only eight syllables. It is not uncommon for all the lines of a verse to begin with a word starting with the same letter or a similar-sounding letter. ==Traditional instruments== *Amyrga (horn used for hunting Maral) *Byzaanchy (4-string spike fiddle) *Chadagan (similar to a zither) *Chanzy (3-string plucked lute) **Bichii chanzy (small chanzy tuned one octave higher) *Doshpuluur (3-string plucked lute) *Dungur (flat drum used by shamans) *Ediski (birch wood vibrated with the mouth to imitate birds) *Igil (2-string bowed horsehead fiddle with skin-covered soundbox) *Khomus (jaw harp) *Shoor (end blown flute used by shamans to attract spirits) *Yat-kha (long zither similar to Korean gayageum) *Xapchyk (rattle made of a dried bull's scrotum filled with the knuckle bones from sheep) *Kengirge (large frame drum) and shyngyrash (bells that sit atop the kengirge) ==Modern music== In parallel with traditional music, modern genres of music developed in Tuva since the 1970s. These were mainly pop and rock music, as well as fusions of these genres with khoomei. The most popular Tuvan musical group is Huun-Huur-Tu. Notable Tuvan rock and fusion performers include: Yat-Kha; Alexander Sarzhat- Ool (guitar), who spent 22 years in jail before starting the music career, and was self-taught; Alexander Chavynchak (guitar), who performed free jazz and blues, as well as khoomei; and Vladimir Oidupaa (bayan and khoomei). Uniformed marching bands are active in the republic, particularly the Brass Band of the Government of Tuva. Created on 24 March 2008 from a student band under the Kyzyl Art College (originally founded in 1960)http://tuvaband.ru/index.php/orkestr/istoriya/171-vozrozhdjonnyj- dukhovoj-orkestr, the average age of band members is 24 years old. It is the only civilian mounted band in Russia, reviving the traditions of its predecessor – the Horse Brass Band of the Tuva People's Revolutionary Army, which was active in the TPRA from 1929 to 1944. The first performance of the band was on horseback during a Victory Day Parade in 2008 in Kyzyl. It also performed the following October for a program dedicated to the 65th anniversary of Tuva joining Russia.http://gov.tuva.ru/region/culture/1325/#:~:text=Духовой%20оркестр%20Правительства%20Республики%20Тыва%20-%20единственный%20конный%20духовой%20оркестр%20в,и%20просуществовавшего%20около%2015%20лет.

(2003) The Great Indie Discography, Canongate, , p. 453 ==Biography== Phranc began her performing career in the late 1970s and early 1980s punk scene in Los Angeles. She had a bleached blonde crewcut and wore male attire, creating an androgynous persona for her first band, Nervous Gender, which formed in 1978. The writer V/D wrote of her for the punk fanzine Slash, \\"On stage, Phranc looks like a 14-year-old runaway from a boys' reform school.\\" The band was influential in the development of what later came to be known as 'electropunk'. In 1980 she left Nervous Gender to join the punk band Catholic Discipline, in which Craig Lee (Bags) and Claude Bessy, journalist for Slash punk fanzine, were the lead singers. She was also in Castration Squad, a feminist, all-female punk band which featured Dinah Cancer of 45 Grave, Elissa Bello of The Go-Go's, Alice Bag of the Bags, Tracy Lea of Redd Kross, and Shannon Wilhelm. Phranc appears with Catholic Discipline in the 1980 documentary The Decline of Western Civilization. In the 1980s, Phranc pursued a solo career. She performs in Paul Morrissey's film Madame Wang's (1981) as Phranque. She began playing an acoustic guitar and released Folksinger on Rhino Records in 1985. She opened for music acts such as The Smiths, Hüsker Dü, Violent Femmes, and Billy Bragg. She styled herself the \\"All-American Jewish Lesbian Folksinger\\" and with a wry sense of humour released the LP I Enjoy Being a Girl in 1989 on Island Records, appearing on the cover with her trademark 'flat top' hair style. Describing a live performance, Adam Block wrote \\"Phranc's unnerving androgyny (expressed with easy confidence) and her fervent opinions (couched in sly, laconic wit) make her a fascinating performer.\\" Her third full-length recording, released in 1991, was Positively Phranc. Phranc was an important influence on the Queercore movement, being acknowledged as such by Team Dresch in their song for her, \\"Uncle Phranc.\\" In the 1990s many queercore bands and musicians involved in queercore music began collaborating with her. She appeared as a guest on the Team Dresch LP/CD Captain My Captain and, as well, members of Team Dresch, Tobi Vail of Bikini Kill, Patty Schemel of Hole and others have played with Phranc on her EP Goofyfoot and other songs. Phranc performs and is interviewed in the queercore documentary She's Real, Worse Than Queer by Lucy Thane, and she has appeared frequently at queercore events such as Olympia's Homo-a-go-go festival. In the 1990s Phranc performed \\"Hot August Phranc\\", performing as Neil Diamond. On her full-length CD of 1998, Milkman, she is joined by Steve MacDonald of Redd Kross, who plays bass. Her most recent releases, including Milkman, appear on her own independent record label, Phancy Records. The 2001 documentary film, Lifetime Guarantee, directed by Lisa Udelson, chronicled Phranc's side job as a Tupperware demonstrator and manager. The documentary showed that despite Phranc's high sales and high- profile, her enthusiastic and sincere approach to the job, and her engaging manner and popularity among the sales force, Phranc was disappointed to find that the Tupperware corporation itself did not celebrate or even acknowledge her genuine achievements in sales and marketing for the company. Phranc was still selling Tupperware in 2008, but as of 2013 her online store was closed. She still performs occasionally, but spends more time working on creative visual art projects, including the Cardboard Cobbler sculptures. In December 2007 she had a solo art show at Cue Art Foundation in New York City curated by Ann Magnuson; the New York Times review compared her work to Claes Oldenburg and Andy Warhol. Phranc had her first major West Coast solo show, at Craig Krull Gallery, June 18 to July 23, 2011, an exhibition made of beach themed cardboard and craft paper works. She continues to work in her Santa Monica studio and is represented by Krull. Phranc was absent from her blog and Facebook from late 2011 to Spring 2014. Phranc announced in April 2014 that she had been prevented from participating in online activities due to an injury. ==Personal life== Phranc lives in Santa Monica, California with her partner and children. ==Discography== { width=\\"100%\\"  valign=\\"top\\" width=\\"40%\\"  === Albums === * Folksinger (1985), Rhino * I Enjoy Being a Girl LP (1989), Island * Positively Phranc LP (1991), Island * Goofyfoot 10\\" EP (1995), Kill Rock Stars * Milkman LP (1998), Phancy  valign=\\"top\\"  === Singles === * \\"Amazon\\" (1985), Stiff * \\"The Lonesome Death of Hattie Carroll\\" (1986), Stiff * \\"Bulldagger Swagger\\" b/w \\"Hillary's Eyebrows\\" 7\\" single (1994), Kill Rock Stars === Compilations === * \\"My Favorite Women Newscasters\\" on The Best of the Radio Tokyo Tapes (Chameleon 8608, 1987) *Some Songs (1997) *Hang Ten Double CD on American Pop Project, Phranc with Satan's Pilgrims * \\"Dumb Hairdresser\\" on Milkshake – A CD to Benefit the Harvey Milk Institute (1998), timmi-kat ReCoRDS * \\"Tupperware Lady\\" on Kat Vox:A CD to Celebrate 20 Years of timmi-kat ReCoRDS (2011), timmi-kat ReCoRDS } ==Exhibitions== ===Solo Exhibitions=== * 2018 Swagger, Craig Krull Gallery, Santa Monica, CA * 2018 The Great Outdoors, Friesen Gallery, Ketchum, ID * 2018 Toys, Craig Krull Gallery, Santa Monica, CA * 2014 It Happened in Sun Valley, Friesen Gallery, Ketchum, ID, * 2014 Winter, Craig Krull Gallery, Santa Monica, CA, 2013 * 2011 Phranc & Co.

Originally transmitted from 16 November to 21 December 1989, with How The Band Got Together repeated on 20 April 2001. #How The Band Got Together: A young villager, Marian, is enraged by the treatment given to her pet tadpole Edwina by the villainous Sheriff of Nottingham and his henchmen. Together with cowardly tailor Robin of Kensington, Rastafarian black marketeer Barrington, congenital moron Rabies and violent dwarf Little Ron, she forms a \\"ruthless band of freedom fighters\\". Robin earns his more famous nickname of \\"Robin Hood\\" by being told to pull his hood over his head when threatening to set fire to King John's underpants. #Robert The Incredible Chicken: Marian attempts to teach the gang to shoot longbows, a skill Robin is incapable of learning. Robin's arrow is wide of the target but gives the Sheriff a near- death experience adding to the belief that Robin is a wonderful marksman and the leader of the gang. This results in a plan by the Baddies to stage an archery contest to trap Robin. Unable to resist the boost to his (false!) ego, Robin enters...in disguise as a large chicken and giving his name as \\"Robert, Robert the Incredible Chicken\\" when asked. Marian saves the day just before Robin's brilliant subterfuge is discovered. Robin's disguise is similar to the one (as a stork) worn by the cartoon fox Robin Hood in the 1973 Disney film. The Baddies still believe that Marian should stay in her kitchen, and that Robin is the leader of the gang. #A Game Called John: Pancake Day celebrations make King John realise that he isn't recognised by the people of Worksop, and he therefore commissions the Sheriff to come up with ways of being remembered. The Sheriff's suggestion is that he invent something – a task promptly delegated to the Sheriff, who comes up with a new game to be called \\"John\\". This game suffers teething problems when the large number of balls required to play simply roll off the table, hence the requirement for green cloth. The cloth is stolen by the Merry Men for their uniforms and the Sheriff gives the rights to the game to a local peasant, mistakenly believing the man's name to be \\"Stinker\\". The new owner of the game, however, is actually known as \\"Snooker\\". #The Miracle of St Charlene: The Merry Men need to build a bridge to cross the river in order to steal from the rich, a task which is not made any easier by Robin's literal adherence to Marian's instructions. Meanwhile, King John's uncle, the Duke of Dagenham, has died, leaving him only a hot water bottle, which the Sheriff is to sell for a grossly inflated price. Of course, the contents of the bottle prove a nice nest egg... #The Sharp End of a Cow: Robin's popularity with the peasants has driven King John to distraction, resulting in his firing the Sheriff (who promptly goes undercover) and chasing the outlaws himself. Likewise, Robin's early-warning system for the Merry Men's hideout has driven Marian to distraction as well. #The Whitish Knight: A mysterious white knight is seen around Worksop. Well, perhaps he's more of a creamy-beigy sort of colour. Or whitish, at any rate. Is it King John's brother, returning from the crusades? And what is to be the fate of Rip-Off, the giant teddy bear? (This episode features Forbes Collins in a dual role as King John and his brother Richard.) ==Series Two== Series Two, despite the appearance of Guy of Gisborne (who is almost the opposite of the character of the same name from the legends) begins to veer away from them and instead move towards a more creative style. Originally transmitted from 15 November to 20 December 1990, and repeated from 27 April to 1 June 2001. #The Beast of Bolsover: A rival gang of outlaws, led by the Australian stereotype the Beast of Bolsover (and his nephew, the Nuisance of Nuneaton) attempt a takeover of Sherwood Forest, much to the disgust of Marian and friends. #The Worksop Egg Fairy: The \\"Worksop Egg Fairy\\" has blessed the highly superstitious peasants with eggs, which is good because King John wants one. The Merry Men are in the position of having to work around village superstition in order to protect the locals. #Little Brown Noses: In an effort to boost revenue, the Sheriff arrests Gladys' chicken, Colin, for illegal parking. Marian tries to inspire the peasants into raising the fine by staging a charity event which brilliantly apes Comic Relief's Red Nose Day charity fundraiser. King John, meanwhile, has been saddled with his nephew, the immature Guy of Gisborne, to look after. (Richard Curtis, the man behind Comic Relief encouraged the creator and writer of Maid Marian (Tony Robinson) to write. Robinson has appeared in multiple Comic Relief broadcasts since its inception, including a notable appearance as Baldrick on CBBC in 1991.) #Rabies in Love: Marian's fundraising is working well, since nobody can beat Rabies in an arm wrestle. Nobody, that is, except Fergi, with whom Rabies promptly falls in love. The Merry Men attempt to help, but are hampered by the fact that King John's plan for getting Guy off his hands is to marry him off to Fergi, a satirical, tongue-in-cheek reference to Fergie. #Rotten Rose - Part 1: Marian's old classmate, Rose Scargill, is one of the many Worksop citizens with her eye on Robin (who has not exactly dispelled the belief that he is the brains behind the Merry Men). Rose gets her hands on some of Robin's possessions, and discovers that she could make good money by turning him over to the authorities. Thus, in a series of deceptions, Robin finds himself in King John's dungeon believing Marian to be a traitor. #Rotten Rose - Part 2: Despite the notable handicap of their own stupidity in the absence of the jailed Robin (who isn't particularly intelligent anyway) and Marian, who has also been jailed, the Merry Men devise a plan to free both and save the day. It certainly isn't Barrington's suggestion that they break into the castle, find Marian, ask her how to break into the castle and save everyone. ==Series Three== By Series Three, the surrealism and anachronisms were well entrenched and the plots had very little to do with the historical setting. More overt parodies and references can be seen here, including the song in Episode 3 \\"Call The Dentist\\" (a direct parody of the Ghostbusters theme), \\"Chop Suey\\" (a slow parody of Elvis Presley's In the Ghetto) in Episode 5 and almost all of Episode 5. The supposed conflict between King John and the Sheriff on one side and the Merry Men on the other is often downplayed in favour of a general comedic situation. Originally transmitted from 7 January to 11 February 1993, and repeated from 8 June to 13 July 2001. #The Big Baby: Barrington develops his line in impressions, leading to concern among some of the Merry Men that he might actually have swallowed other people. King John, meanwhile, decrees that his subjects should give him presents, resulting in the appearance of a life-size jelly baby looking vaguely like him. The jelly baby is captured, leaving the Sheriff to devise the new holiday of \\"Bloopy\\" to justify the need for presents. The Merry Men, meanwhile, put Barrington's talents to use. #Driving Ambition: In order to cheer up the locals of Worksop, Marian establishes a (Eurovision-esque) singing competition, which Rose promptly hijacks. The Sheriff, too, has a vested interest in the money – which he needs to pay off King John's driving instructor. Since Guy has entered and has bet against himself, some crooked judges are required to make sure the money goes in the right direction. Barrington, being quite a good singer, wants to enter himself and Marian singing a duet, so they need bent judges too. Both the Sheriff and the Merry Men are bound to clash. #Keeping Mum: Marian's mother, labouring under the misapprehension that her daughter is a dental receptionist, comes to visit. The Merry Men are only too happy to join in the charade of being dentists. The Sheriff, meanwhile, views the new arrival as the perfect bait to trap and arrest Marian. #They Came From Outer Space: A mysterious fireball is seen over the village and Guy begins to talk about his invisible alien friend, Plop-Bop. The peasants and the Merry Men are also thinking about life on other planets, while King John is concerned about the defence implications, which means that the Sheriff has to raise more money from the peasants to defend against invasion by space carriage. The only things the peasants have left to lose are the clothes on their backs, which are promptly taken, causing Marian to harness the alien mania herself. #Robin and the Beansprout: Robin's excuses, bearing remarkable resemblances to last night's bedtime story, have driven Marian to distraction. In his quest to find dinner, Robin only finds a beansprout, but a series of events uncannily like Jack and the Beanstalk transpire to have him return triumphantly with takeaway Chinese food. #The Great Mud Harvest: The peasants of Worksop are broke; there is simply no more money to tax. With the job done, the Sheriff sacks Gary, before being threatened with the sack himself by King John unless he can find another source of wealth in Worksop. Marian attempts famine relief, which does no good with the fatalistic peasants, until Robin appears in his new white suit, which he keeps singing about. Marian bets him that he cannot keep it clean \\"until the end of this episode\\". Little does she know exactly what Worksop is sitting on top of. ==Christmas Special== *Maid Marian and Much the Mini Mart Manager's Son After his tap-dancing lesson with Barrington, Robin foolishly reveals his identity to the Sheriff, but Much (the Mini Mart Manager's son) has a word and persuades the Sheriff to disperse his guards. Marian is further unimpressed at Much's manipulation of the peasants fear of \\"the Giant Toad Monster of Stoke-on-Trent\\" to sell tacky toys. When Guy threatens to leave, King John promises to catch Robin and his gang for him if they could only strengthen their forces. Originally transmitted as one 50 minute episode on 24 December 1993, and repeated as two 25 minute episodes on 20 July and 27 July 2001. This episode can be found as an extra on the series 3 DVD release. ==Series Four== Series Four, the final series of the programme, is in many ways the most bizarre. On one hand, the comedy became more sophisticated: the roleplaying references in Episode 1, the parodies of English seaside culture in Episode 3 and the Beatles references in Episode 4 are jokes aimed over the heads of a juvenile audience. The appearance of Clem Costner is a reference to the Robin Hood movies – and the fact that the Costner character is Robin's antithesis is perhaps unsurprising – while the inversion of the entire culture in the final episode demonstrates that nothing is sacred. On the other hand, the comedy also became more juvenile, and there was more slapstick and pie gags than in the other three series combined. Originally transmitted from 5 January to 16 February 1994, with five of the seven episodes repeated (The Wise Woman of Worksop and Voyage to the Bottom of the Forest were not included) from 3 August to 31 August 2001. #Tunnel Vision: The Sheriff and King John have cooked up a scheme to build a tunnel to Scunthorpe. Meanwhile, Sherwood Forest is in the midst of a gaming craze – with the Merry Men playing \\"Chronic the Hedgehog\\" and \\"Dungeons & Dragons\\". Rose kidnaps Guy just as his mother appears, and Gary and Graeme wade through a spot-on parody of The Crystal Maze with Richard O'Brien stand-in \\"Robin O'Hood\\", which leads to the Sheriff losing track of reality and fantasy when presented with the Used Tissue of Invisibility. #Bouncy Sheriff: King John wants Guy's toys out of the castle, or else he will turn the Sheriff into a Bouncy Sheriff for his nephew's enjoyment. Marian, meanwhile, quits the gang over their sexist attitudes and starts selling home improvements with Rose. Rose conspires with the Sheriff to deliver Marian, the Merry Men and a brand new flat-pack extension on the back of Nottingham Castle to King John. #Raining Forks: A cold virus (or The Plague) is sweeping through Worksop like the Plague (a different plague). Even King John catches it and decides he needs a break by the sea. The Sheriff rounds up the peasants and gets them to build a seaside holiday camp. As luck would have it, the Merry Men are on holiday not far from the new camp and devote their energies to infiltrating it and stopping the forced labour so that everyone can celebrate High Forks Night. #The Wise Woman of Worksop: The Merry Men are suffering from insomnia and Robin is keeping everyone else up with his all-night raves. Only wise old Gladys knows what to do, mixing up some of her Sleepy Cake. Unfortunately, things go wrong, leaving the Merry Men looking like the Beatles, and the gang have to free Gladys's father, who has been locked in King John's dungeon. Rabies, of all people, devises a plan to resolve this situation, featuring an appearance of \\"Pixie Paul and his little wife Linda\\" and it actually works. (This episode was not repeated in 2001 due to the death of Linda McCartney since the original transmission.) #Robin the Bad: Clem (Kevin) Costner, a man who looks exactly like Robin, is wreaking havoc in Worksop, even (apparently) killing King John. The peasants, dismayed at this change in his character, transfer their affections to the Sheriff. It's all down to Barrington, Rabies and Little Ron to prove Robin's innocence. #The Nice Sumatran: Marian attempts to scare off King John, who is actually scared off, surrendering his crown to Guy. He takes refuge with the Merry Men, who reluctantly decide to follow the example of the Nice Sumatran towards unfortunate rich people and agree to let him stay. However, relations with the new guest deteriorate and Marian realises she has to scare Guy into surrendering the crown to King John again, which requires an unlikely alliance with the Sheriff. #Voyage to the Bottom of the Forest: Rabies is lazy, so much so that many of the Merry Men's plans simply don't work because of him. However, the robbery of a battleship and its subsequent launch take the Merry Men to the parallel universe of Engyland, where Rabies' arrival has been eagerly awaited by the good people of Workflop, particularly the Nottyman, to save them from the wicked witch. ==References== Maid Marian and her Merry Men Maid Marian and her Merry Men episodes ","title":"List of Maid Marian and Her Merry Men episodes"},{"id":"1284775","text":"Abigail Gifford Rogers (January 20, 1841 - May 21, 1894) was the first wife of Henry Huttleston Rogers (1840–1909), an American business magnate. As children, Abbie and Henry, each of Mayflower lineage, grew up and went to school together in Fairhaven, Massachusetts, a small coastal fishing town with a whaling heritage. They were married in 1862, and started their family life together in a one-room shack in the newly discovered western Pennsylvania oil fields. Although he and Abbie lived frugally for many years, by 1875, Henry Rogers had risen in the petroleum industry to become one of the key men in John D. Rockefeller’s Standard Oil Trust. He invested heavily in various industries, including copper, steel, mining, and railways. The Virginian Railway is widely considered his final life's achievement. Rogers amassed a great fortune, estimated at over $100 million, and became one of the wealthiest men in the United States. Abbie and Henry Rogers were generous, providing many public works for their hometown of Fairhaven, including the Town Hall which Abbie donated in 1894 shortly before her death. Rogers also financially assisted such notables as Mark Twain, Helen Keller, and Booker T. Washington. Abbie and Henry Rogers had six children, four of whom survived to adulthood. She died suddenly on May 21, 1894, following an operation in New York City. After her death, Henry Rogers is said to have immersed himself even more in his work during the 15 years he outlived her. When he died in 1909, he was interred with her at Riverside Cemetery in Fairhaven. == Childhood in Fairhaven, Massachusetts== Abigail Palmer Gifford was the younger daughter of Captain Peleg W. Gifford and his wife, Amelia L. Hammond.https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/121087745/abbie-palmer-rogers Abbie's father had been a whaling ship captain and participated in the \\"Great Stone Fleet\\" of scuttled ships that blockaded Charleston Harbor during the American Civil War. It is said that Captain Gifford loved to discuss his career as a very successful ship-master. The Giffords' home, built in 1835, was located at 36 Green Street in Fairhaven, (now numbered 115 Green Street). As Abbie grew up, one of her schoolmates and neighbors in the small coastal town was young Henry Huttleston Rogers, nicknamed \\"Hen\\", her future husband. Both Abbie and Henry were descendants of colonists who had arrived at the Plymouth Colony on the Mayflower in 1620. == Whaling, oil, opportunity, roughing it in Pennsylvania == Prior to the second half of the 19th century, whale oil was the primary source of fuel for lighting in the United States. The whaling industry was the mainstay for many New England coastal communities for over 200 years. Among these was Fairhaven, Massachusetts, founded on land purchased by English settlers of the Plymouth Colony from a friendly Native American tribal chief, Massasoit, and his son, who was named Wamsutta. In 1854, natural oil (petroleum) was discovered in western Pennsylvania. In 1859, George Bissell and Edwin L. Drake made the first successful use of a drilling rig at Titusville, Pennsylvania. Production from this single well soon exceeded the entire cumulative oil output which had taken place in Europe since the 1650s. The principal product of the oil was kerosene. Another related product was natural gas. Kerosene and natural gas soon replaced whale oil in North America for illuminating purposes. In New England, whaling reached its peak in 1857, then gradually began a period of decline, partially due to Scandinavian competition. The situation was aggravated considerably by the American Civil War, as whaling vessels and crews were diverted to assist in blockading the Confederate coastal areas and ports. By 1900, the whaling industry had collapsed, due in part to the discovery and refining of petroleum from the western Pennsylvania oil fields. Perhaps realizing both the trend and opportunity, in 1861, 21-year-old Henry H. Rogers pooled his savings of approximately $600 with a friend, Charles Ellis. They set out to western Pennsylvania and its newly discovered oil fields. The young partners began their small Wamsutta Oil Refinery at McClintocksville near Oil City, Pennsylvania. The old Indian name \\"Wamsutta\\" was apparently selected in honor of their hometown area of New England. In nearby New Bedford, the Wamsutta Company had opened in 1846, the first of many textile mills that gradually came to supplant whaling as the principal employment activity in the area. Rogers and Ellis, and their tiny Wamsutta Oil Refinery, made $30,000 their first year. This amount was more than 3 entire whaling ship trips from back home could hope to earn during an average voyage of more than a years' duration. As a result, Rogers was regarded as very successful when he returned home to Fairhaven for a short vacation the next year. There, in 1862, Abbie Palmer Gifford married young Henry Rogers, her childhood sweetheart. She returned with him to the oil fields where they lived in a one-room shack along Oil Creek, where her young husband and Ellis worked the Wamsutta Oil Refinery. A short time later, Rogers met Charles Pratt (1830–1891). Pratt had been born in Watertown, Massachusetts. In nearby Boston, he had joined a company specializing in paints and whale oil products. In 1850 or 1851, Pratt moved to New York City, where he worked for a similar company handling paint and oil. Pratt saw the same trend as Ellis and Rogers, and he became a pioneer of the natural oil (petroleum) industry. He established a kerosene refinery (Astral Oil Works) in Brooklyn, New York. Pratt's product later gave rise to the slogan, The holy lamps of Tibet are primed with Astral Oil. In Pennsylvania in the mid-1860s, when Pratt and Rogers met, Pratt had earlier bought whale-oil from Ellis in Fairhaven, and they were already acquainted. The two young men agreed to sell the entire output of their small refinery to Pratt at a fixed price. This went well at first. However, Ellis and Rogers had no wells of their own, and were dependent upon purchasing crude oil to refine and sell to Pratt. A few months later, crude oil prices suddenly increased due to manipulation by speculators. The young entrepreneurs struggled to try to live up to their contract with Pratt, but soon their surplus was wiped out. Before long, they were heavily in debt to Pratt. Ellis gave up, but in 1866, Rogers went to Pratt in New York City and told him he would take personal responsibility for the entire debt. This so impressed Pratt that he immediately hired Rogers for his own organization. == Moving to New York, oil refining == Pratt made Rogers foreman of his Brooklyn refinery, with a promise of a partnership if sales ran over fifty thousand dollars a year. Abbie, Henry, and their baby Anne moved to Brooklyn. In the next few year Rogers became, in the words of Elbert Hubbard, Pratt's \\"hands and feet and eyes and ears\\" (Little Journeys to the Homes, 1909). The Rogers family continued to live frugally, and Henry worked very hard. Abbie brought his meals to the \\"works\\", and often he would sleep but three hours a night rolled up in a blanket by the side of a still. Rogers moved steadily from foreman to manager, and then superintendent of Pratt's Astral Oil Refinery. Pratt finally gave Rogers an interest in the business as promised. In 1867, with Rogers as a partner, he established the firm of Charles Pratt and Company. In the early 1870s, Pratt and Rogers became involved in a conflict with the infamous South Improvement Company, which was basically a scheme to obtain favorable net shipping rates of oil owned by John D. Rockefeller's interests from the Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR) and other railroads through a secret system of rebates. Rockefeller and the South Improvement Company scheme outraged independent oil producers in western Pennsylvania and refineries there and afar alike. The opposition to the South Improvement Company scheme among the New York refiners was led by Rogers. The New York interests formed an association, and about the middle of March, 1872, sent a committee of three, with Rogers, representing the Pratt interests, as head, to Oil City to consult with the Oil Producers' Union there. Their arrival in the oil regions was a matter of great satisfaction to the Pennsylvania independents. Together, they soon managed to forge an agreement with the PRR and other railroads, whose leaders eventually agreed to open rates to all and promised to end their shady dealings with South Improvement. The oil men were exultant, but their joy was to be short-lived, for Rockefeller had already begun forming his Standard Oil organization and was busy trying another approach, which included frequently buying up opposing interests. A short time later, Rockefeller approached Charles Pratt with his plans of cooperation and consolidation. Pratt talked it over with Rogers, and they decided that the combination would benefit them. Rogers formulated terms, which guaranteed financial security and jobs for Pratt and himself. John D. Rockefeller quietly accepted the offer on Rogers' exact terms. In 1874, Charles Pratt and Company (including Astral Oil) became one of the important formerly independent refiners to join Rockefeller's organization, and it was to become part of the Standard Oil Trust when it was formed. Pratt's son Charles Millard Pratt (1858–1913) became Secretary of Standard Oil. Rogers soon rose to become one of Rockefeller's key men of Standard Oil. By 1890, he was a Vice-President and headed the important production committee. Rogers also invested outside of Standard Oil and became one of the wealthiest men in the world. He had interests in oil, gas, steel, copper, coal, and railroads, and eventually founded and built the Virginian Railway at the end of his own career. After 1874, the Rogers family continued to live in New York City, but vacationed at Fairhaven, where a large mansion was erected for them. == Family and children == Abbie was the mother of five children, four girls and a boy. Another little son had died at birth. Their eldest daughter, Anne Engle Rogers, was born in 1865 in Pennsylvania. The family moved to New York in 1866. Daughter Cara Leland Rogers was born in Fairhaven in 1867, Millicent was born in 1873, followed by Mary (who became known as Mai) in 1875. Their son, Henry Huttleston Rogers Jr., was born in 1879, and came to be known as Harry. In adulthood, after the death of his father, he became known as Colonel Henry Huddleston Rogers, apparently returning to an earlier spelling of his middle name. The title of Colonel was apparently honorific, not uncommon in those times. Local historians recall that the children of Henry Huttleston Rogers and Abbie Gifford Rogers were far more than vacationers in Fairhaven. Their roots were deep in the community. They spent time with grandparents and family friends, and became knowledgeable about the traditions of the old whaling town. === Anne Engle Rogers Benjamin === Anne married William Evarts Benjamin, a prominent Boston publisher and collector. They had 2 children, Beatrice Benjamin Cartwright and Henry Rogers Benjamin. === Cara Leland Rogers Broughton, Lady Fairhaven === In 1890, Cara Leland Rogers married Bradford Ferris Duff of New York. Their marriage was to end a year later, in 1891, when her new husband, aged twenty-four, died of a lung ailment at the Rogers' Fairhaven residence, making Cara a widow at twenty-three. In the 1890s, Cara's father had begun to consider a sewer and water project for the Fairhaven community. After much consultation with experts, he had chosen to adopt a sewerage plan developed in England known as the \\"Shone Sewer System\\". To manage the project, a young English engineer, Urban Hanlon Broughton, was sent to town by the Shone executives to explain procedure and direct the actual work. During his stay, Cara Duff had become acquainted with the young Englishman. By 1895, the sewer work was well on the way to completion, and Cara Rogers Duff and Urban Broughton had decided to be married. Cara became Mrs. Urban Broughton in late 1895. Departing on Christmas Day, they sailed across the Atlantic Ocean on a honeymoon trip to Europe. The Broughtons' first child, a son, was born in Fairhaven in 1896, and was named Urban Huttleston Broughton. A second son was born in 1900, and was called Henry Rogers Broughton. Although Urban Broughton was by birth an English subject, he spent more than twenty-five years in America, many of them in Chicago, Illinois. Urban Broughton became president of Utah Consolidated Mining Co. in 1901, and was chosen a director and a manager of the United Metals Selling Co., the selling agency for Amalgamated Copper. He was also a director of the Atlas Tack Co. in Fairhaven, the Santa Rica Mining Co., and the Butte Coalition Mining Co. in Montana. After the sudden death of his father-in-law (Henry H. Rogers Sr.) in 1909, Urban Broughton became president of The Virginian Railway Company. In 1912, Urban, Cara, and their two sons, Huttleston Broughton, and Henry Broughton, moved to England. They took up residence in Mayfair, London. Urban became a member of Parliament (MP). He found pleasure in this new career, becoming a close personal friend of Prime Minister Bonar Law. Cara devoted herself to family matters and other domestic duties. Their young sons soon became thoroughly-oriented British subjects. During World War I, both Urban and Cara were very active in the war effort. Urban served the English government in many ways. He published a strong brochure designed to appeal to the good will of America entitled \\"The British Empire at War\\". Cara offered all her efforts to the good of her adopted country as well, sponsoring many types of war work. She was deeply interested in the well-being of Bethnal Green Military Hospital. She gave hospitable parties for wounded soldiers at the family home in Broadoaks, Byfleet. During the 1920s, the Broughtons visited Fairhaven several times. In 1926, Cara purchased the revolutionary war site of Fort Phoenix and donated it to the city of Fairhaven, Massachusetts. Today, it is a park. Urban Broughton died in 1929, at the age of 72. Earlier in the same year, his name had been pending for elevation to the peerage by King George V. On May 2, 1929, the King proclaimed \\"... Cara Leland Broughton, widow of Urban Hanlon Broughton, may henceforth enjoy the same style and title as if her husband...had survived and received the title and dignity of Baron Fairhaven\\". The eldest son, Huttleston, was elevated to his father's barony, and became the first Baron Fairhaven, and Cara, the first Lady Fairhaven. === Millicent Gifford Rogers === Millicent \\"Millie\\" Gifford Rogers was born in 1873. It is recorded that the child loved to draw sketches and read. She is to have once said on a visit to Fairhaven \\"I wish we had a good library!\\" However, in 1890 she died of heart failure at age 17. The grieving Rogers family sought an appropriate means of memorializing her short life. Because she had been an avid reader, especially of poetry, the Rogers decided that they would build and donate to the town of Fairhaven a library named for her and given in the names of her sisters and brother. In the same year she had died, land was acquired and plan were begun to erect in Fairhaven a unique and lavish tribute to the arts, the splendid yet functional Millicent Library. The cornerstone was laid in September, 1891 at a quiet morning ceremony with only the family and their clergyman, Rev. J.M. Leighton, in attendance. After prayer, Millie's little brother, Harry, set the cornerstone. Within its confines were a sketch of Millicent, a tracing of the Rogers' ancestry, and a copy of the Fairhaven Star carrying a picture of the proposed building. The Millicent Library describes the memorial window to the little girl who wished for a good library in Fairhaven as follows: > In the Library, just to the left of the main entrance, is a stunning > stained-glass window made by Clayton and Bell of London. In the central > panel is the figure of Erato, the Muse of Poetry, and her features bear a > striking resemblance to those of the girl to whose memory the library was > erected. === Mary Huttleston Rogers Coe === Mary Huttleston Rogers, known as \\"Mai\\", was the youngest daughter, born in 1875 in Fairhaven. Mai was educated at private seminary schools, spoke fluent French, played the piano, and was interested in art and decoration. After an earlier marriage which was unsuccessful (her father and family friend Mark Twain labeled her first husband a \\"scalawag\\"), on June 4, 1900, she married William Robertson Coe, a 30-year-old insurance company manager. Coe had met her during a transatlantic crossing. Between 1900 and 1910, the couple had four children: William Rogers Coe (1901–1971), Robert Douglas Coe (1902–1985), Henry Huttleston Rogers Coe (1907–1966), and Natalie Mai Coe Vitetti (1910–1987). By 1910, Coe had become president of insurance broker Johnson & Higgins, and he was involved in insuring the hull of the RMS Titanic which sank on its maiden voyage in 1912. Coe rose to become Chairman of the Board of Johnson and Higgins by 1916, a position he held until 1943. Coe was on the Board of Directors of The Virginian Railway Company from 1910 until his death in 1955, and headed the company for a brief period during World War II. He was also a director of Loup Creek Colliery and the Wyoming Land Company. Mai and her husband had a large estate, Planting Fields, built on the Gold Coast of Long Island, New York. They named the manor house \\"Coe Hall\\". Mai and her husband shared a love of horticulture. Following an extended illness, Mai died in 1924, and was interred nearby. In 1949, their estate was donated by Coe to become Planting Fields Arboretum State Historic Park. ===Henry Huttleston Rogers Jr. === Henry Huttleston Rogers Jr. was born in 1879. He came to be known as Harry. He was the youngest of the Rogers children. Harry became a favorite of Rogers family friend Mark Twain, who in 1897 dedicated his new book Following The Equator with the following quipping preface: > This Book Is Affectionately Inscribed To My Young Friend, \\\\- HARRY ROGERS - > With recognition of what he is and apprehension of what he may become, > unless he form himself a little more closely upon the model of - The Author As a young adult, Harry often joined his father and family friends on trips aboard their luxury steam yacht Kanawha, built in 1899. Harry married his first wife, Mary Benjamin. He and his wife traveled to Virginia with his father and Twain on the Kanawha in September, 1907 when the latter spoke at Robert Fulton Day at the Jamestown Exposition. After their 1929 divorce he married 2, Marguerite von Braun Savell Miles (married 1929-33) and 3, Pauline Van der Voort Dresser (married 1933). Harry journeyed again with his father and Twain to Norfolk, Virginia, in April, 1909 for the dedication ceremonies and dinner to celebrate the completion of the Virginian Railway, which turned out to be his father's s final life achievement. After his father's death the following month, Harry took over his father's seat on the Board of Directors of the new railroad, with his brother-in-law, Urban Broughton, serving as the railroad's President. He assembled a valuable collection of model sailing ships, which were donated the United States Naval Academy at Annapolis, Maryland, after his death in 1935. Harry and Mary Rogers had a son, Harry III, and a daughter, Millicent Rogers, a prominent socialite during the 1930s and 1940s whose vast collection of turquoise jewelry and Native American artifacts are housed in the Millicent Rogers Museum in Taos, New Mexico. == 1894: A new Town Hall and tragedy == In 1894, Fairhaven received the gift of a new Town Hall from the Rogers Family. Abbie dedicated it to the memory of her mother. The following text about Abbie Rogers is from the Millicent Library, Fairhaven Massachusetts. \\"Mother of six children, Mrs. Rogers is represented as having been of a quiet and retiring disposition, completely devoid of the ostentation often associated with great wealth. Contemporary photographs attest to a shy and gentle charm of feature, and she is known to have cherished a deep affection for Fairhaven and a nostalgia for the simple ways of her childhood. \\"She was, therefore, delighted to become the donor of Fairhaven's beautiful new 'Town House,' and on February 22nd and 23d, 1894, she attended dedication exercises and received graciously at the splendid Dedication Ball, in the first gala functions marking the opening of the new building. \\"It was not given those attending these happy festivities to know that - but three months later - in May, 1894, this gentle woman was to die in New York City after an operation performed to save her life.\\" == Death== Abbie Palmer Gifford Rogers died unexpectedly on May 21, 1894, age 53 in New York City. She had been undergoing an operation to remove a tumor.http://www.millicentrogers.org/museum_info1.htm . Her widower, Henry Rogers Sr., eventually remarried, but had no children with his second wife. Outliving her two days short of 15 years, after his death on May 19, 1909, he was interred beside her in Fairhaven's Riverside Cemetery. ==Legacy== The Town Hall in Fairhaven survives, as do many other gifts of the Rogers' family to Fairhaven, where she and her husband grew up. The home of Captain Peleg Gifford (Abbie's childhood home), a two-story gable-end frame house built in the Greek Revival style at 36 Green Street, has been preserved. It and many other historic buildings in Fairhaven are opened periodically for special public tours. The bronze plaque on the Fairhaven Town Hall, reads: :This Building was presented to the Town of Fairhaven February 22, 1894, three months prior to the death of the donor Abbie Palmer Gifford Rogers. The people of Fairhaven in expressing their appreciation and gratitude for the gift would also record the sorrow they feel as a community through the loss of one whose life was full of good works. May this structure in its strength and beauty ever stand as commemorative of her character and thoughtful kindness. ==See also== *Standard Oil *William N.

Rogers"},{"id":"1284781","text":"Phædo or Phaedo (; , Phaidōn, ), also known to ancient readers as On The Soul, is one of the best-known dialogues of Plato's middle period, along with the Republic and the Symposium. The philosophical subject of the dialogue is the immortality of the soul. It is set in the last hours prior to the death of Socrates, and is Plato's fourth and last dialogue to detail the philosopher's final days, following Euthyphro, Apology, and Crito. One of the main themes in the Phaedo is the idea that the soul is immortal. In the dialogue, Socrates discusses the nature of the afterlife on his last day before being executed by drinking hemlock. Socrates has been imprisoned and sentenced to death by an Athenian jury for not believing in the gods of the state (though some scholars think it was more for his support of \\"philosopher kings\\" as opposed to democracy)I. F. Stone is among those who adopt a political view of the trial. See the transcript of an interview given by Stone here: http://law2.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/socrates/ifstoneinterview.html. For ancient authority, Stone cites Aeschines (Against Timarchus 173). and for corrupting the youth of the city. By engaging in dialectic with a group of Socrates' friends, including the two Thebans, Cebes, and Simmias, Socrates explores various arguments for the soul's immortality in order to show that there is an afterlife in which the soul will dwell following death. Phaedo tells the story that following the discussion, he and the others were there to witness the death of Socrates. The Phaedo was first translated into Latin from Greek by Henry Aristippus in 1160. Today, it is generally considered one of Plato's greatest works. ==Summary== The dialogue is told from the perspective of one of Socrates' students, Phaedo of Elis, who was present at Socrates' death bed. Phaedo relates the dialogue from that day to Echecrates, a Pythagorean philosopher. Socrates offers four arguments for the soul's immortality: * The Cyclical Argument, or Opposites Argument explains that Forms are eternal and unchanging, and as the soul always brings life, then it must not die, and is necessarily \\"imperishable\\". As the body is mortal and is subject to physical death, the soul must be its indestructible opposite. Plato then suggests the analogy of fire and cold. If the form of cold is imperishable, and fire, its opposite, was within close proximity, it would have to withdraw intact as does the soul during death. This could be likened to the idea of the opposite charges of magnets. * The Theory of Recollection explains that we possess some non-empirical knowledge (e.g. The Form of Equality) at birth, implying the soul existed before birth to carry that knowledge. Another account of the theory is found in Plato's Meno, although in that case Socrates implies anamnesis (previous knowledge of everything) whereas he is not so bold in Phaedo. * The Affinity Argument explains that invisible, immortal, and incorporeal things are different from visible, mortal, and corporeal things. Our soul is of the former, while our body is of the latter, so when our bodies die and decay, our soul will continue to live. * The Argument from Form of Life, or The Final Argument explains that the Forms, incorporeal and static entities, are the cause of all things in the world, and all things participate in Forms. For example, beautiful things participate in the Form of Beauty; the number four participates in the Form of the Even, etc. The soul, by its very nature, participates in the Form of Life, which means the soul can never die. ===Introductory conversation=== The scene is set in Phlius where Echecrates who, meeting Phaedo, asks for news about the last days of Socrates. Phaedo explains why a delay occurred between his trial and his death, and describes the scene in a prison at Athens on the final day, naming those present. He tells how he had visited Socrates early in the morning with the others. Socrates' wife Xanthippe was there, but was very distressed and Socrates asked that she be taken away. Socrates' relates how, bidden by a recurring dream to \\"make and cultivate music\\", he wrote a hymn and then began writing poetry based on Aesop's Fables. Socrates tells Cebes to \\"bid him (his friend) farewell from me; say that I would have him come after me if he be a wise man\\" Simmias expresses confusion as to why they ought hasten to follow Socrates to death. Socrates then states \\"... he, who has the spirit of philosophy, will be willing to die; but he will not take his own life.\\" Cebes raises his doubts as to why suicide is prohibited. He asks, \\"Why do you say ... that a man ought not to take his own life, but that the philosopher will be ready to follow one who is dying?\\" Socrates replies that while death is the ideal home of the soul, man, specifically the philosopher, should not commit suicide except when it becomes necessary. Man ought not to kill himself because he possesses no actual ownership of himself, as he is actually the property of the gods. He says, \\"I too believe that the gods are our guardians, and that we men are a chattel of theirs\\". While the philosopher seeks always to rid himself of the body, and to focus solely on things concerning the soul, to commit suicide is prohibited as man is not sole possessor of his body. For, as stated in the Phaedo: \\"the philosopher more than other men frees the soul from association with the body as much as possible\\". Body and soul are separate, then. The philosopher frees himself from the body because the body is an impediment to the attainment of truth. Of the senses' failings, Socrates says to Simmias in the Phaedo: > Did you ever reach them (truths) with any bodily sense? – and I speak not of > these alone, but of absolute greatness, and health, and strength, and, in > short, of the reality or true nature of everything. Is the truth of them > ever perceived through the bodily organs? Or rather, is not the nearest > approach to the knowledge of their several natures made by him who so orders > his intellectual vision as to have the most exact conception of the essence > of each thing he considers? The philosopher, if he loves true wisdom and not the passions and appetites of the body, accepts that he can come closest to true knowledge and wisdom in death, as he is no longer confused by the body and the senses. In life, the rational and intelligent functions of the soul are restricted by bodily senses of pleasure, pain, sight, and sound. Death, however, is a rite of purification from the \\"infection\\" of the body. As the philosopher practices death his entire life, he should greet it amicably and not be discouraged upon its arrival, for, since the universe the Gods created for us in life is essentially \\"good,\\" why would death be anything but a continuation of this goodness? Death is a place where better and wiser Gods rule and where the most noble souls exist: \\"And therefore, so far as that is concerned, I not only do not grieve, but I have great hopes that there is something in store for the dead ..., something better for the good than for the wicked.\\" The soul attains virtue when it is purified from the body: \\"He who has got rid, as far as he can, of eyes and ears and, so to speak, of the whole body, these being in his opinion distracting elements when they associate with the soul hinder her from acquiring truth and knowledge – who, if not he, is likely to attain to the knowledge of true being?\\" ===The Cyclical Argument=== Cebes voices his fear of death to Socrates: \\"... they fear that when she [the soul] has left the body her place may be nowhere, and that on the very day of death she may perish and come to an end immediately on her release from the body ... dispersing and vanishing away into nothingness in her flight.\\" In order to alleviate Cebes' worry that the soul might perish at death, Socrates introduces his first argument for the immortality of the soul. This argument is often called the Cyclical Argument. It supposes that the soul must be immortal since the living come from the dead. Socrates says: \\"Now if it be true that the living come from the dead, then our souls must exist in the other world, for if not, how could they have been born again?\\". He goes on to show, using examples of relationships, such as asleep-awake and hot-cold, that things that have opposites come to be from their opposite. One falls asleep after having been awake. And after being asleep, he awakens. Things that are hot came from being cold and vice versa. Socrates then gets Cebes to conclude that the dead are generated from the living, through death, and that the living are generated from the dead, through birth. The souls of the dead must exist in some place for them to be able to return to life. ===The Theory of Recollection Argument=== Cebes realizes the relationship between the Cyclical Argument and Socrates' Theory of Recollection. He interrupts Socrates to point this out, saying: > ... your favorite doctrine, Socrates, that our learning is simply > recollection, if true, also necessarily implies a previous time in which we > have learned that which we now recollect. But this would be impossible > unless our soul had been somewhere before existing in this form of man; here > then is another proof of the soul's immortality. Socrates' second argument, the Theory of Recollection, shows that it is possible to draw information out of a person who seems not to have any knowledge of a subject prior to his being questioned about it (a priori knowledge). This person must have gained this knowledge in a prior life, and is now merely recalling it from memory. Since the person in Socrates' story is able to provide correct answers to his interrogator, it must be the case that his answers arose from recollections of knowledge gained during a previous life. ===The Affinity Argument=== Socrates presents his third argument for the immortality of the soul, the so-called Affinity Argument, where he shows that the soul most resembles that which is invisible and divine, and the body resembles that which is visible and mortal. From this, it is concluded that while the body may be seen to exist after death in the form of a corpse, as the body is mortal and the soul is divine, the soul must outlast the body. As to be truly virtuous during life is the quality of a great man who will perpetually dwell as a soul in the underworld. However, regarding those who were not virtuous during life, and so favored the body and pleasures pertaining exclusively to it, Socrates also speaks. He says that such a soul as this is: > ... polluted, is impure at the time of her departure, and is the companion > and servant of the body always and is in love with and bewitched by the body > and by the desires and pleasures of the body, until she is led to believe > that the truth only exists in a bodily form, which a man may touch and see, > and drink and eat, and use for the purposes of his lusts, the soul, I mean, > accustomed to hate and fear and avoid that which to the bodily eye is dark > and invisible, but is the object of mind and can be attained by philosophy; > do you suppose that such a soul will depart pure and unalloyed? Persons of such a constitution will be dragged back into corporeal life, according to Socrates. These persons will even be punished while in Hades. Their punishment will be of their own doing, as they will be unable to enjoy the singular existence of the soul in death because of their constant craving for the body. These souls are finally \\"imprisoned in another body\\". Socrates concludes that the soul of the virtuous man is immortal, and the course of its passing into the underworld is determined by the way he lived his life. The philosopher, and indeed any man similarly virtuous, in neither fearing death, nor cherishing corporeal life as something idyllic, but by loving truth and wisdom, his soul will be eternally unperturbed after the death of the body, and the afterlife will be full of goodness. Simmias confesses that he does not wish to disturb Socrates during his final hours by unsettling his belief in the immortality of the soul, and those present are reluctant to voice their skepticism. Socrates grows aware of their doubt and assures his interlocutors that he does indeed believe in the soul's immortality, regardless of whether or not he has succeeded in showing it as yet. For this reason, he is not upset facing death and assures them that they ought to express their concerns regarding the arguments. Simmias then presents his case that the soul resembles the harmony of the lyre. It may be, then, that as the soul resembles the harmony in its being invisible and divine, once the lyre has been destroyed, the harmony too vanishes, therefore when the body dies, the soul too vanishes. Once the harmony is dissipated, we may infer that so too will the soul dissipate once the body has been broken, through death. Socrates pauses, and asks Cebes to voice his objection as well. He says, \\"I am ready to admit that the existence of the soul before entering into the bodily form has been ... proven; but the existence of the soul after death is in my judgment unproven.\\" While admitting that the soul is the better part of a man, and the body the weaker, Cebes is not ready to infer that because the body may be perceived as existing after death, the soul must therefore continue to exist as well. Cebes gives the example of a weaver. When the weaver's cloak wears out, he makes a new one. However, when he dies, his more freshly woven cloaks continue to exist. Cebes continues that though the soul may outlast certain bodies, and so continue to exist after certain deaths, it may eventually grow so weak as to dissolve entirely at some point. He then concludes that the soul's immortality has yet to be shown and that we may still doubt the soul's existence after death. For, it may be that the next death is the one under which the soul ultimately collapses and exists no more. Cebes would then, \\"... rather not rely on the argument from superior strength to prove the continued existence of the soul after death.\\" Seeing that the Affinity Argument has possibly failed to show the immortality of the soul, Phaedo pauses his narration. Phaedo remarks to Echecrates that, because of this objection, those present had their \\"faith shaken,\\" and that there was introduced \\"a confusion and uncertainty\\". Socrates too pauses following this objection and then warns against misology, the hatred of argument. ===The Argument from Form of Life=== Socrates then proceeds to give his final proof of the immortality of the soul by showing that the soul is immortal as it is the cause of life. He begins by showing that \\"if there is anything beautiful other than absolute beauty it is beautiful only insofar as it partakes of absolute beauty\\". Consequently, as absolute beauty is a Form, and so is Life, then anything which has the property of being animated with Life, participates in the Form of Life. As an example he says, \\"will not the number three endure annihilation or anything sooner than be converted into an even number, while remaining three?\\". Forms, then, will never become their opposite. As the soul is that which renders the body living, and that the opposite of life is death, it so follows that, \\"... the soul will never admit the opposite of what she always brings.\\" That which does not admit death is said to be immortal. Socrates thus concludes, \\"Then, Cebes, beyond question, the soul is immortal and imperishable, and our souls will truly exist in another world. \\"Once dead, man's soul will go to Hades and be in the company of,\\" as Socrates says, \\"... men departed, better than those whom I leave behind.\\" For he will dwell amongst those who were true philosophers, like himself. ==Legacy== Plato's Phaedo had a significant readership throughout antiquity, and was commented on by a number of ancient philosophers, such as Harpocration of Argos, Porphyry, Iamblichus, Paterius, Plutarch of Athens, Syrianus and Proclus.For a full list of references to the fragments that survive from these commentaries, see now Gertz 2011, pp. 4–5 The two most important commentaries on the dialogue that have come down to us from the ancient world are those by Olympiodorus of Alexandria and Damascius of Athens.Both are translated in two volumes by L.G. Westerink (1976–7), The Greek Commentaries on Plato's Phaedo, vols. I & II, Amsterdam: North-Holland Pub. Co. The Phaedo has come to be considered a seminal formulation, from which \\"a whole range of dualities, which have become deeply ingrained in Western philosophy, theology, and psychology over two millennia, received their classic formulation: soul and body, mind and matter, intellect and sense, reason and emotion, reality and appearance, unity and plurality, perfection and imperfection, immortal and mortal, permanence and change, eternal and temporal, divine and human, heaven and earth.\\" == See also == * Papyrus Oxyrhynchus 229 * Rationalism * Allegory of the Cave ==Notes== ==Texts and translations== *Greek text at Perseus *Plato: Euthyphro, Apology, Crito, Phaedo, Phaedrus.

It has a population of around 13,500 and stands in the Rhymney Valley. Before the Industrial Revolution and the coming of coal mining in the South Wales Coalfield the valley was rural and farmed. It lies in the community of Gelligaer. == Origin of the name == In the Welsh language, ystrad is a wide flat bottomed valley. The termination ach is associated with the names of marshy floodplains of rivers and is also found nearby in the names Llanbradach and Llancaiach. Ystrad Mynach is a corruption of Ystrad-Man-Ach (man = place) and is not derived from the Welsh mynach meaning monk. Prior to erection of defences on the River Rhymney in the 1960s the town was indeed subject to periodic flooding. == Amenities and history == The town houses a number of council offices, as well as the Ystrad Mynach campus of Coleg y Cymoedd, a further education college established in 1959 to provide training for local coal miners and merged with neighbouring Coleg Morgannwg to form Coleg y Cymoedd in 2013. The nearby Penallta Colliery was the last coal mine to close in the valley. Other notable buildings and structures are the Ystrad Mynach railway station, opened in 1890, the viaduct, a sculpture to commemorate the areas industrial heritage, a community hospital, a number of schools, and the Beech Tree, Coopers Arms and Royal Oak pubs. From 1927 to 1996, Ystrad Mynach hosted the 'F' division headquarters of Glamorgan Constabulary (from 1968, South Wales Police). Ystrad Mynach railway station was a location for one of Ronnie Barker's Porridge episodes. Records show that Ystrad Mynach railway station was in existence in 1857, when it was known as Ystrad Junction. A new Local General Hospital Ysbyty Ystrad Fawr was opened in late 2011. Work started on the Ystrad Fawr site in September 2007. It is located between the A469 Caerphilly to Newbridge Road and the old Caerphilly Road between Ystrad Mynach and Llanbradach. This replaced the services provided by the previous Ystrad Mynach Hospital. Situated to the north of Ystrad Mynach, is a collection of houses called Tredomen; these houses were built to house the workers of the since-demolished Tredomen Works. They are socially graded houses – ranging from two-up two-down, to a five-bedroom manor in Park Lane with adjoining servants' quarters. In February 2018, the Beech Tree Fish Bar was severely damaged in a car crash, and the incident made national news. No-one was killed, but three people were taken to hospital. == Mobile telecommunications technology == There are four mobile phone masts in Ystrad Mynach operated by 3 (3G), Vodafone (2G), O2 (2G) and EE (2G + 3G) (previously T-Mobile. 3 has plans to build a new Ultrafast mast. ==Sport== ===Penallta Rugby Football Club=== Penallta RFC is a rugby union club is based in Ystrad Mynach. The Rugby Club was inaugurated by a group of miners from Penallta colliery in 1952. It is an affiliated member of the Welsh Rugby Union and plays in the Welsh National League. Since 2000, Penallta RFC has been one of the most successful rugby clubs in Wales, winning numerous titles at all levels. Penallta won the Worthington Welsh District's Cup at the Millennium Stadium in 2001, the Swalec Plate at the Millennium Stadium in 2012 and the National Plate at the Principality Stadium in 2017. They finished runner's up in the Plate competition in 2016, meaning the village club played in a youth or senior final at the National Stadium a remarkable five times in six seasons. Amid a string of league titles, including winning Division 1 East in 2015, Penallta has won two Silver Ball titles, in 2005 and 2015. Penallta Youth has also been extraordinarily successful. The youth team played at the Millennium Stadium in 2014 and 2015, winning the coveted Welsh Youth Cup and then finishing runners-up a year later. In 2014 the Penallta Youth side, led by Scarlets player Jack Condy, won all eight competitions they entered, winning every single game. ===UCY - Union Cycliste Ystrad Mynach=== UCY - Union Cycliste Ystrad Mynach was founded in May 2013 by Arwel James. The club caters for male and female cyclists from teenage upwards. As of October 2018, the club has around 100 members. Weekly club runs range from 30 to 80 miles. Weekly rides include the Sunday club run, commencing at 9 am, Saturday, 9 am for the popular leisurely \\"Breakfast Club\\" ride, and during the Summer months, the club hosts evening rides (mainly Tuesday & Thursday). All club rides leave from the Centre For Sporting Excellence. It is a social cycling club which focuses on local sportives and charity cycling events. The club has affiliation to Welsh Cycling and British Cycling; affiliation to Cycling Time Trials commenced in January 2015 and the club has begun competing in road, circuit and time trial racing. The club regularly receives Sports Wales funding for training equipment and venue hire to encourage off season fitness. Qualified coaches support development and rider safety. ===Centre for Sporting Excellence=== thumb The CCB Centre for Sporting Excellence was erected on Caerphilly Road in May 2014. The centre has taken its place on the land of the old Ystrad Mynach Hospital and was built in conjunction with many partners, including Heron Bros Ltd Of Northern Ireland, at a cost of around £6 million. The facility is run by Caerphilly County Borough Council and it is hoped the local community will use the centre to create a thriving sporting culture within the region. ===Valley Greyhound Stadium=== The Valley Greyhound Stadium is a greyhound racing stadium in Twyn Road sandwiched between the Caerphilly Road and A469 and on the east bank of the Rhymney River (on the north side of the Dyffryn Business Park). It opened in 1976. ==New Cottage Dance Centre== The New Cottage Dance Centre is on The Bridge in Ystrad Mynach and is home to dance teams. The dance centre has six registered teachers on the IDTA website. The 'Ystrad Fawr' formation teams have been successful in the British Championships. Their teams being former British Champions. In 2016, the 'Ystrad Fawr Dancers' entered the talent contest, Britain's Got Talent and made it through the heats. On 21 May, it was then announced that the team got through to the semi-finals. They competed in the semi-final (23 May) and finished 9th place. == Notable natives / residents == *Paul Atherton, film producer/director *Richard Brake, actor *Mervyn Burtch, composer *Andy Fairweather-Low, guitarist *Morgan Lindsay, (1857–1935), British Army officer and racehorse trainer ==See also== *2353 (Ystrad Mynach) Squadron ATC ==References== ==External links== *Ystrad Mynach College *Welsh Coal Mines - check out the local pit history *An old photo of Ystrad Mynach in 1938 *Union Cycliste Ystrad Mynach Category:Towns in Caerphilly County Borough ","title":"Ystrad Mynach"},{"id":"1284789","text":"Gabor A. Somorjai (born May 4, 1935) is a professor of chemistry at the University of California, Berkeley, and is a leading researcher in the field of surface chemistry and catalysis, especially the catalytic effects of metal surfaces. For his contributions to the field, Somorjai won the Wolf Prize in Chemistry in 1998, the Linus Pauling Award in 2000, the National Medal of Science in 2002, the Priestley Medal in 2008, the 2010 BBVA Foundation Frontiers of Knowledge Award in Basic Science and the NAS Award in Chemical Sciences in 2013. Most recently, in April 2015, Somorjai was awarded the American Chemical Society's William H. Nichols Medal Award. ==Early history== Somorjai was born in Budapest in 1935 to Jewish parents. He was saved from the Nazis when his mother sought the assistance of Raoul Wallenberg in 1944 who issued Swedish passports to Somorjai's mother, himself and his sister saving them from the Nazi death camps. While Somorjai's father ended up in the camp system, he was fortunate to survive but many of Somorjai's extended family ended up in the camp system. He was studying chemical engineering at the Budapest University of Technology and Economics in 1956. As a participant in the 1956 Hungarian Revolution, Somorjai left Hungary to go to the US after the Soviet invasion. Along with other Hungarian immigrants, Somorjai enrolled in post-graduate study at Berkeley and obtained his doctorate in 1960. He joined IBM's research staff in Yorktown Heights, New York for a few years but returned to Berkeley as an assistant professor in 1964. ==Chemical research== The introduction of new technology such as low-energy electron diffraction revolutionised the study of surfaces in the 1950s and 1960s. However, early studies were limited to surfaces such as silicon, important for its electrical properties. In contrast, Somorjai was interested in surfaces such as platinum known for its chemical properties. Somorjai discovered that the defects on surfaces are where catalytic reactions take place. When these defects break, new bonds are formed between atoms leading to complex organic compounds such as naphtha to be converted into gasoline as an example. These findings led to greater understanding of subjects such as adhesion, lubrication, friction and adsorption. His research also has important implications such as nanotechnology. In the 1990s, Somorjai started working with physicist Y. R. Shen on developing a technique known as Sum Frequency Generation Spectroscopy to study surface reactions without the need for a vacuum chamber. He is also studying surface reactions in nanotechnology at the atomic and molecular level using atomic force microscopy and scanning tunnelling microscopy, both of which can be used without vacuum. Somorjai's expertise in surfaces was used as a consultant to the 2002 Winter Olympics where he gave advice on how to make ice-skating surfaces as fast as possible. Somorjai's research had shed new light on ice, demonstrating that skaters skated on a top-layer of rapidly vibrating molecules, rather than on a layer of liquid water on top of the ice acting as a lubricant, which had previously been the generally accepted explanation for the slipperiness of ice. During his career, Somorjai has published more than one thousand papers and three textbooks on surface chemistry and heterogeneous catalysis. He is now the most-often cited person in the fields of surface chemistry and catalysis. ==Honors and awards== Somorjai was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 1979 and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1983. He was awarded the Wolf Foundation Prize in Chemistry in 1998 for his contribution to chemistry, sharing the honor with Professor Gerhard Ertl of the Fritz-Haber Institute in Berlin. Somorjai was awarded the National Medal of Science for his contribution as a chemist in 2002. The American Chemical Society has also awarded him the Peter Debye Award in Physical Chemistry and the Adamson Award in Surface Chemistry. In 2002, he was awarded the status of University Professor across the University of California network, an honor he shares with two dozen other academics. In 2004 he won the F.A. Cotton Medal for Excellence in Chemical Research of the American Chemical Society. In 2008 he received the Priestley Medal, the highest award of the American Chemical Society, for his \\"extraordinarily creative and original contributions to surface science and catalysis\\". In 2009 he was named a Miller Senior Fellow of the Miller Institute at the University of California Berkeley. He was awarded the prestigious 2010 BBVA Foundation Frontiers of Knowledge Award in Basic Science. In addition he was also awarded in 2010 the ENI New Frontiers of Hydrocarbons Prize and the Honda Prize. The recipient of the 2007 Nobel Prize in Chemistry, Gerhard Ertl, and other members of the surface science community, were surprised and mystified by the Nobel Prize committee's decision to pass over Somorjai, awarding the prize for surface-chemistry to Ertl alone. In 2009 Somorjai was recipient of the Reed M. Izatt and James J. Christensen Lectureship. In 2013 Somorjai was awarded the National Academy of Sciences NAS Award in Chemical Sciences. Most recently, in April 2015, Somorjai was awarded the American Chemical Society's William H. Nichols Medal. ==The Somorjai Award== The Gabor A. Somorjai Award for Creative Research in Catalysis, consisting of US$5,000.00 and a certificate, is given annually to recognize outstanding research in the field of catalysis.The Gabor A. Somorjai Award for creative research in catalysis The award is sponsored by the Gabor A. and Judith K. Somorjai Endowment Fund.Gabor A. Somorjai Award for Creative Research in Catalysis Previous recipients have been : ==The Gabor A. and Judith K. Somorjai Visiting Miller Professorship Award== Established in 2011, the Gabor A. and Judith K. Somorjai Visiting Miller Professorship Award is one of the programs of the Miller Institute for Basic Research in Science at the University of California Berkeley. The Somorjais' wishes in the establishment of this award is to support visiting scientists in the broad field of chemical sciences for a one-month term in the Miller Institute. The first award was granted in 2013 to Angelos Michaelides.

Their traditional music is a mixture of Turkic and Finno-Ugric elements, reportedly bridging Mongolian and Hungarian music. Nonetheless, the most distinguishing feature of Tatar music is the pentatonic scale, which aligns it with the Chinese and Vietnamese musical traditions. Instrumental dance music, secular song and sacred music are all a part of Tatar folk music. Instrumentation includes the kubyz (jaw harp), surnay, quray (flute) and garmon-talianka. In the mid-20th century, a number of Tatar composers became renowned, including Cäwdät Fäyzi, Salix Säydäş, Mansur Mozaffarov and Näcip Cihanov. Many of the works of the Russian-Tatar composer Sofia Gubaidulina have been inspired by Tatar music. The largest center of Tatar national music is the Jalil Opera and Ballet Theatre named after Musa Cälil.Jalil Opera and Ballet Theatre The first Tatar opera, Saniä, was staged in 1925.Первая татарская опера (к 80-летию со дня постановки оперы «Сания») It was composed by Soltan Gabashi in collaboration with Vasili Vinogradov. Farit Yarullin was the creator of the first Tatar ballet, Şüräle. Modern Tatar music includes practically all existing basic musical genres. Almaz Monasypov is one of the first Soviet Tatar composers re-embodied in modern music the ancient layers of the national tradition like baits (), munajats () and book singing (). Modern, non-traditional music includes pop, rock, hip-hop music (for example, İttifaQ), etc. One of the most remarkable artists, who obtained her own niche in Tatar music is the renowned world music singer and composer Zulya Kamalova,aka Zulya who currently resides in Australia. One of the most outstanding examples of contemporary Tatar music is the rock opera The Wanderer in Bulgar – an amalgamation of Tatar Folk Music, the Tatar Opera tradition and western rock music arrangements with Russian rock prints. Tatar pop singers Alsou (who sings in English, Russian and Tatar) and Zemfira (who sings mostly in Russian) are currently among the most popular musical performers in Russia.

He is best known for hosting The Cross-Wits, and as an offstage announcer for Password and Wheel of Fortune. On the latter, he succeeded original announcer Charlie O'Donnell and held the role from 1980 until his death in 1988. (O'Donnell took back the announcing position until his own death in 2010.) ==Early career== When Clark was a student at University of California, Berkeley (UC Berkeley), he began his career as a substitute radio announcer for radio station KROW in Oakland, California. After graduating from UC Berkeley, he moved to New York City, and first worked as a game show announcer for Password (where, when the word was flashed on the screen, he would whisper from offstage, \\"the password is...\\"; he also occasionally substituted for host Allen Ludden). From there, he went on to host 100 Grand (1963) and Dealer's Choice from 1974-75 (replacing Bob Hastings). Later, Clark hosted The Cross-Wits from 1975 until 1980, where he was noted for his rapport with the celebrities and contestants. Clark later went on to announce for several other game shows, including Split Second (1972–1975), Tattletales (1974), Three for the Money (1975), Second Chance (1977), and some Hollywood-originated episodes of The $10,000 Pyramid. Earlier in 1967, Clark also did some commercials for Winston cigarettes in Super King (100 MM) size. Clark also hosted a number of pilot episodes that never passed that stage. Among these were Second Guessers, The $10,000 Sweep, and a 1985 proposed revival of Now You See It (later sold in 1989). He was also the announcer on another pilot, Monday Night Quarterback. Clark did many of these pilots \\"on spec\\" as favors to their producers. During his tenure with The Cross-Wits, Clark also hosted Say Powwww (1979), a live, interactive game series on Metromedia stations in California. ==Wheel of Fortune and later career== After Wheel of Fortune announcer Charlie O'Donnell's departure from the show in 1980, Clark was chosen to become the show's regular announcer. During that time, Clark announced the daytime version and the primetime syndicated version, when the show's ratings peaked. Clark also announced for other television programs in the 1980s, including The $25,000 Pyramid (1982–1985), as well as being a spokesman for National Geographic magazine, appearing on-camera in their commercials. ==Illness and death== In 1988, Clark was diagnosed with bone cancer. He continued announcing for Wheel of Fortune for as long as he was able to up until the end of the 1987–88 season. During that time, hosts Pat Sajak and Vanna White announced the fee plugs on the syndicated version. When he was away, Charlie O'Donnell and Johnny Gilbert began filling in as substitute announcers. Clark died on July 21, 1988 at the age of 62, just before production of the 1988–1989 season was to begin, and is interred at Glendale's Forest Lawn Memorial Park. He had requested that O'Donnell return to take his place, but since O'Donnell was not available due to his prior obligations with Barris Industries, Los Angeles-area disc jockey M.G. Kelly announced from mid-1988 to February 1989, when O'Donnell returned to the show. O'Donnell remained as the announcer until his death in 2010. ==References== ==External links== * Category:1925 births Category:1988 deaths Category:Game show announcers Category:American game show hosts Category:People from St. Joseph, Missouri Category:People from Los Angeles Category:University of California, Berkeley alumni Category:Deaths from bone cancer Category:Deaths from cancer in California Category:Burials at Forest Lawn Memorial Park (Glendale) ","title":"Jack Clark (television personality)"},{"id":"1284805","text":"Rudolf Wlassak (27 March 1865, Brno - 10 March 1930, Vienna) was an Austrian physiologist and neurologist.

Harold was a professor who taught at Stanford University and Gloria was a political activist. Leavitt graduated Yale University with a B.A in English in 1983. After the success of Family Dancing, David spent much of the 1990s living in Italy working and restoring an old house in Semproniano in Tuscany with his partner. He has also taught at Princeton University. While a student at Yale University, he published two stories in The New Yorker titled Territory and Out Here, both of which were later included in his first collection Family Dancing (nominated for the National Book Critics Circle Award and finalist for the PEN/Faulkner Award). Other published fiction includes the short-story collections A Place I've Never Been, Arkansas and The Marble Quilt, as well as the novels The Lost Language of Cranes, Equal Affections, While England Sleeps (finalist for the Los Angeles Times Fiction Prize), The Page Turner, Martin Bauman, The Body of Jonah Boyd and The Indian Clerk (finalist for the PEN/Faulkner Award and shortlisted for the IMPAC Dublin Award). In 2000, Leavitt moved to Gainesville, Florida and became a member of the Creative Writing faculty at the University of Florida as well as the founder and editor of the literary journal Subtropics. Leavitt, who is openly gay, has frequently explored gay issues in his works. As a teenager, he was frequently frightened by gay novels that placed emphasis on the ideal male body. He found this theme, and its suggestion that homoerotic fulfillment was reserved for the exceptionally beautiful young men, to be intrusive. His writing explores universal themes such as complex family relationships, as well as class and sex exploitation. Illness and death are also recurrent themes in his work, inspired by his experience with his mother's cancer diagnosis and eventual death when he was growing up. Despite writing both short stories and novels, Leavitt has been quoted as feeling more confident as a short story writer. He has been criticized as writing too quickly, which he attributes to early experiences with death convincing him that his life as a writer is short. His writing has been considered both minimalist as well as being part of the literary Brat Pack, however, he has made \\"a fierce effort to disassociate\\" himself from both. He considers his works too long, emotional and descriptive for the minimalism genre. Leavitt’s favorite novelist is Penelope Fitzgerald, with his favorite works being The Beginning of Spring, The Gate of Angel and The Blue Flower. He has also been influenced by writers such as John Cheever, Alice Munro, Cynthia Ozick, Joseph Roth and W. G. Sebald. He was also inspired by the works of Grace Paley, whom he credits for teaching him the importance of humble experiences in great fiction. ==Copyright suit== In 1993, Leavitt was sued over the publication of his novel While England Sleeps by the English poet Stephen Spender, who accused him of using elements of Spender's memoir World Within World in the novel, and brought suit against Leavitt for copyright infringement. Viking-Penguin, Leavitt's publisher at the time, withdrew the book. In 1995, Houghton Mifflin published a revised version of While England Sleeps with a preface by the author addressing the novel's controversy. In \\"Courage in the Telling: The Critical Rise and Fall of David Leavitt\\", Drew Patrick Shannon argues that the critical backlash that accompanied the Spender incident \\"allowed [critics] to reinforce the boundaries between gay and mainstream literature that Leavitt had previously crossed\\". Subsequent reviews of Leavitt's work were more favorable. The Spender episode provided Leavitt with the basis for his novella The Term-Paper Artist. ==Adaptations== Two of Leavitt's novels have been filmed: The Lost Language of Cranes (1991) was directed by Nigel Finch and The Page Turner (released under the title Food of Love) was directed by Ventura Pons.

One of the country's main instruments is a two-stringed horse-head fiddle called a morin khuur. This is a similar instrument to that found across the region. Other elements of Buryat music, such as the use of fourths both in tuning instruments and in songs, and pentatonic scales, reveal similarities to music from Siberia and Eastern Asia. There traditionally was no polyphony, instead voices and instruments performed the same melody in unison but varied in timing and ornamentation. Narrative structures are a part of most Buryat folk music, often in the form of epic tales, and the last song of famous leaders; these include the Last Song of Rinchin Dorzhin. Under Soviet control, Buryat folk music was sanitized and mostly allowed in forms that were supportive of the state's power. This period saw state-approved songs recollecting events such as the Civil War and the Great Patriotic War. The first Buryat rock band was Uragsha, who were one of the few bands of the time to sing both in Russian and their native tongue. Their collaborations with La MaMa theater in New York City in late 1990s led to their embrace of traditional music and shamanic roots too, and eventually to formation of the group Namgar that represents Buryat traditional music at world music festivals since 2001.

It is the world's longest bridge to have one pylon and one cable-stayed plane. Nový most is an asymmetrical cable- stayed bridge with a main span length of , a total length of , a width of , and a weight of . Its steel construction is suspended from steel cables, connected on the Petržalka side to two pillars. There are four lanes for motor traffic on the upper level and lanes for bicycles and pedestrians on the lower level. ==History== Since its construction in 1972 the bridge was called Most SNP (\\"Bridge of the Slovak National Uprising\\"), although locally it was called New Bridge. In 1993, its name was changed by the Bratislava City Council to Nový Most (\\"New Bridge\\") to unify its official name with that actually used by the people, as it was the second bridge to be built over Danube river in the city. However, another three bridges have been constructed since its opening, and on 29 March 2012 members of the Bratislava City Council voted in favor of an initiative by the Mayor of Old Town Táňa Rosová (SDKÚ-DS) to change the bridge's name back to Most SNP, effective 29 August 2012, the day of 68th anniversary of Slovak National Uprising.

Lu Watters and the Yerba Buena Jazz Band, and trombonist Turk Murphy, adopted the repertoire of Joe \\"King\\" Oliver, Jelly Roll Morton, Louis Armstrong and W. C. Handy: bands included banjo and tuba in the rhythm sections. A New Orleans- based traditional revival began with the later recordings of Jelly-Roll Morton and the rediscovery of Bunk Johnson in 1942, leading to the founding of Preservation Hall in the French Quarter during the 1960s. Early King Oliver pieces exemplify this style of hot jazz; however, as individual performers began stepping to the front as soloists, a new form of music emerged. One of the ensemble players in King Oliver's Creole Jazz Band, Louis Armstrong, was by far the most influential of the soloists, creating, in his wake, a demand for this \\"new\\" style of jazz, in the late 1920s and early 1930s. Other influential stylists who are still revered in traditional jazz circles today include Sidney Bechet, Bix Beiderbecke, Wingy Manone and Muggsy Spanier. Many artists of the big band era, including Glenn Miller, Gene Krupa and Benny Goodman, had their beginnings in trad jazz. ==Britain== In Britain, where boogie-woogie, \\"stride\\" piano and jump blues were popular in the 1940s, George Webb's Dixielanders pioneered a trad revival during the Second World War, and Ken Colyer's Crane River band added and maintained a strong thread of New Orleans purism. Humphrey Lyttelton, who played with Webb, formed his own band based on the New Orleans/Louis Armstrong tradition in 1948 but, without losing the Armstrong influence, gradually adopted a more mainstream approach. By 1958 his band included three saxophones. During the 1950s and well into the 1960s the \\"Three B's\\" Chris Barber, Acker Bilk, and Kenny Ball were particularly successful, all making hit records. Other successful bands including Terry Lightfoot, George Chisholm, Monty Sunshine, Mick Mulligan, with George Melly, and Mike Cotton - who \\"went R'n'B\\" in 1963–4 - made regular appearances live, on the air and occasionally in the British charts, as did Louis Armstrong himself. More light-hearted versions were offered by the Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band, the Temperance Seven and the New Vaudeville Band. Dixieland stylings can be found here and there on records by the Rolling Stones, the Beatles, the Small Faces and the Kinks, while the Who actually performed trad jazz in their early days. In the 1950s a number of provincial amateur bands had strong local followings and occasionally appeared together at \\"Jazz Jamborees\\". These bands included the Merseysippi Jazz Band, still active, which toured overseas, Second City Jazzband (Birmingham), Steel City Stompers (Sheffield), Clyde Valley Stompers (Glasgow), and the Saints Jazzband (Manchester). Chris Barber gave a stage to Lonnie Donegan and Alexis Korner, setting off the craze for skiffle and then British rhythm and blues that powered the beat boom of the 1960s. A revival of interest in the 1970s included the New Black Eagle Jazz Band, still active, and in the late 1980s a number of musicians such as Wynton Marsalis began performing and recording not only original trad jazz tunes but new compositions in the style as well. ==References== Category:Jazz genres Category:Jazz terminology ","title":"Trad jazz"},{"id":"1284866","text":"Deaf-blind American author, activist, and lecturer Helen Keller in 1904 Deafblindness is the condition of little or no useful hearing and little or no useful sight. There are different degrees of vision loss and auditory loss within each individual, thus making the deafblind community unique with many types of deafblindness involved. Because of this diversity, each deafblind individual's needs regarding lifestyle, communication, education, and work need to be addressed based on their degree of dual-modality deprivation in order to improve their ability to live independently. In 1994, it was estimated that roughly 35,000–40,000 United States residents are medically deafblind. Helen Keller was a well-known example of a deafblind individual. Furthermore, the deafblind community has its own culture, creating a community of deafblindness similar to the Deaf community and the blind community. Each community is made up of a group of individuals who have undergone similar experiences and have a homogeneous understanding of what it means to be deafblind, even with a large diversity of unique backgrounds. Some deafblind individuals view their condition as a part of their identity. == Epidemiology == The medical condition of deafblindness comes in different forms. For some, this condition might occur congenitally from birth as a result of genetic defect, for others it happens suddenly due to a form of illness or accident that results in a modality deprivation of either vision or hearing, or both. A person might be born deaf and become blind at a later stage in life, or vice versa. In any given case of deafblindness, there are many possible onsets and causes of this condition, some happen gradually, others happen unexpectedly and suddenly. The diagnosis of deafblindness could be medically classified into specific types based on one’s symptoms and causes. There are two overarching types of deafblindness: congenital and acquired. Congenital deafblindness: the condition of deafblindness from birth * Pregnancy complexities ** Effects of alcohol/drugs *** Fetal alcohol syndrome ** A result of prematurity ** Causes from illness/infection *** Rubella *** AIDS *** Cytomegalovirus *** Syphilis *** Toxoplasmosis * Genetic conditions (evident from birth) ** Anomalies/syndromes (there are numerous genetic defects that may contribute to one's medical condition of deafblindness, of which some of more well-known syndromes are listed) ***CHARGE syndrome *** Down syndrome *** Marshall syndrome *** Rubella syndrome *** Stickler syndrome *** Trisomy 13 Acquired deafblindnness: condition of deafblindness developmental later in life * Genetic conditions (evident at a later stage in life) **Usher syndrome ** Alport syndrome * Age-related loss of modality (vision or auditory or both) * Illness ** Meningitis * Somatic injuries **Brain damage/trauma ** Stroke ** Permanent physical damage (relating to vision or hearing) == Communication == Deafblind people communicate in many different ways as determined by the nature of their condition, the age of onset, and what resources are available to them. For example, someone who grew up deaf and experienced vision loss later in life is likely to use a sign language (in a visually modified or tactile form). Others who grew up blind and later became deaf are more likely to use a tactile mode of spoken/written language. Methods of communication include: * Use of residual hearing (speaking clearly, hearing aids, or cochlear implants) or sight (signing within a restricted visual field, writing with large print). * Tactile signing, sign language, or a manual alphabet such as the American Manual Alphabet or Deaf-blind Alphabet (also known as \\"two-hand manual\\") with tactile or visual modifications. * Interpreting services (such as sign language interpreters or communication aides). * Communication devices such as Tellatouch or its computerized versions known as the TeleBraille and Screen Braille Communicator. * Tadoma, a tactile modality. Multisensory methods have been used to help deafblind people enhance their communication skills. These can be taught to very young children with developmental delays (to help with pre-intentional communication), young people with learning difficulties, and older people, including those with dementia. One such process is Tacpac. Deafblind amateur radio operators generally communicate on 2-way radios using Morse code. ==Technology== Braille equipment includes a variety of multipurpose devices, which enhance access to distance communication. Some can be used as stand-alone devices connected via Wi-Fi, while others are paired with a mobile device to provide tactile access to e-mail, text messaging, and other modern communication resources. To receive Braille equipment, an eligible consumer must be proficient in Braille and must have access to the Internet or cellular service. The Telebraille does not have a computer communications modem but does have a TTY (TDD) modem. It was designed as a TTY for deaf-blind people and is also useful for face-to-face conversation. It has two components. The sighted component is a modified SuperCom TTY device. It has a qwerty keyboard and a single-line LED display. The display is regular size and is not particularly suited to people with low vision. The SuperCom TTY can be connected directly to the telephone line using a conventional telephone jack or the telephone receiver can be coupled to the SuperCom on a cradle on top of the device. Text flows past the display in a continuous stream, like tickertape. The SuperCom is connected to the Braille portion of the device by a cable that is about two feet long. The Braille display is about 15 characters in width, although there is a knockout to allow additional characters to be installed, at considerable additional cost. The Telebraille is able to communicate in ASCII mode but is not compatible with conventional computer modems. There is what looks like a RS-232 socket on the back of the Braille component, but the instructions for the Telebraille state that this jack is for \\"future use\\" and that no computer devices should be attached to it. A graphic Braille display can be used in sensing graphic data such as maps, images, and text data that require multiline display capabilities such spreadsheets and equations. Graphic Braille displays available in the market are DV-2 (from KGS), Hyperbraille, and TACTISPLAY Table/Walk (from Tactisplay Corp.). For example, TACTISPLAY Table can show 120*100 resolution refreshable Braille graphics on one page. ==In popular culture== The 1959 play The Miracle Worker, and its film adaptation released in 1962, recounts Anne Sullivan's efforts to draw Helen Keller from her world of blindness and deafness. The Who’s 1969 album Tommy tells one continuous life story about a deafblind boy named Tommy through songs. The 2005 Bollywood film Black featured Rani Mukerji as a deafblind character named Michelle McNally. Haben Girma, the first deafblind individual to graduate from Harvard Law School, released an autobiography entitled Haben: The Deafblind Woman Who Conquered Harvard Law in 2019. The film Marie's Story relates the childhood and education of Marie Heurtin, a deafblind woman. == See also == *Tadoma *Tangible symbol systems *Tommy (rock opera) *White cane (used by blind people to assist them in walking) ==References== == External links == * *The National Center On Deaf- Blindness Official informational website on deafblindness in United States. *The Helen Keller National Center for Deaf-Blind Youths and Adults Helen Keller Services website catering for the deaf-blind and blind communities. *World Federation of the Deaf-blind Website for worldwide information concerning deafblindness. *Able Australia Informational website on deafblindness in Australia. *\\"Haben Girma Homepage\\" About Haben Girma, the first deafblind Harvard Law School graduate.

The guard rails were designed only to stop vehicles up to 13 tons and were unable to hold the truck, which fell 30 meters off the A 4 Autobahn and exploded. The truck driver was killed; the heat damage destroyed the load-bearing ability of the bridge and it had to be closed to traffic. Provisional repairs were made in autumn 2004. Plans for a replacement bridge are expected to be formulated in the spring of 2005. Repairs are estimated at € 32 million and replacement could cost up to € 250 million, including the cost for disposing of the waste.

He was placed in a gymnasium in Eutin, which was under the direction of ,Morris 1874, p. 289. a philologist influenced by Immanuel Kant. He was educated at the universities of Kiel, Leipzig, Berlin. He became more and more attracted to the study of Plato and Aristotle, and his 1826 doctoral dissertation, Platonis de ideis et numeris doctrina ex Aristotele illustrata (On Plato's Doctrine of Ideas and Numbers as Illustrated by Aristotle), was an attempt to reach through Aristotle's criticisms a more accurate knowledge of the Platonic philosophy. He declined the offer of a classical chair at Kiel, and accepted a post as tutor to the son of an intimate friend of Karl vom Stein zum Altenstein, the Prussian minister of education. He held this position for seven years (1826–1833), occupying his leisure time with the preparation of a critical edition of Aristotle's De anima (1833; 2nd ed. by Christian Belger, 1877). In 1833 Altenstein appointed Trendelenburg extraordinary professor in Berlin, and four years later he was advanced to an ordinary professorship. ==Teaching== For nearly 40 years, he proved himself markedly successful as a teacher, during the greater part of which time he had to examine in philosophy and pedagogics all candidates for the scholastic profession in Prussia. His teaching method was highly regarded by Søren Kierkegaard who called him \\"one of the most sober philosophical philologists I know.\\"Søren Kierkegaard's Journals and Papers, V A 98, 1844 He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1861. Two of his prominent students were Franz Brentano and Wilhelm Dilthey. ==Philosophical work== ===Defense of teleology=== Trendelenburg's philosophizing is conditioned throughout by his loving study of Plato and Aristotle, whom he regards not as opponents but as building jointly on the broad basis of idealism. His own standpoint may be called a modern version of Aristotelianism. While denying the possibility of an absolute method and an absolute philosophy, as contended for by Hegel and others, Trendelenburg was emphatically an idealist in the ancient or Platonic sense; his whole work was devoted to the demonstration of the ideal in the real. But he maintained that the procedure of philosophy must be analytic, rising from the particular facts to the universal in which we find them explained. We divine the system of the whole from the part we know, but the process of reconstruction must remain approximative. Our position forbids the possibility of a final system. Instead, therefore, of constantly beginning afresh in speculation, it should be our duty to attach ourselves to what may be considered the permanent results of historic developments. The classical expression of these results Trendelenburg finds mainly in the Platonico-Aristotelian system. The philosophical question is stated thus: How are thought and being united in knowledge? How does thought get at being? And how does being enter into thought? Proceeding on the principle that like can only be known by like, Trendelenburg next reaches a doctrine peculiar to himself (though based upon Aristotle) that plays a central part in his speculations. Motion is the fundamental fact common to being and thought; the actual motion of the external world has its counterpart in the constructive motion involved in every instance of perception or thought. From motion he proceeds to deduce time, space and the categories of mechanics and natural science. These, being thus derived, are at once subjective and objective in their scope. It is true that matter can never be completely resolved into motion, but the irreducible remainder may be treated, like Aristotle, as an abstraction we asymptotically approach but never reach. The facts of existence, however, are not adequately explained by the mechanical categories. The ultimate interpretation of the universe can only be found in the higher category of End or final cause. Here Trendelenburg finds the dividing line, between philosophical systems. On the one side stand those that acknowledge none but efficient causes, which make force prior to thought, and explain the universe, as it were, a tergo (\\"from the back\\"). This may be called, typically, Democritism. On the other side stands the organic or teleological view of the world, which interprets the parts through the idea of the whole, and sees in the efficient causes only the vehicle of ideal ends. This may be called in a wide sense Platonism. Systems like Spinozism, which seem to form a third class, neither sacrificing force to thought nor thought to force, yet by their denial of final causes inevitably fall back into the Democritic or essentially materialistic standpoint, leaving us with the great antagonism of the mechanical and the organic systems of philosophy. The latter view, which receives its first support in the facts of life, or organic nature as such, finds its culmination and ultimate verification in the ethical world, which essentially consists in the realization of ends. Trendelenburg's Naturrecht [the right of nature] may, therefore, be taken as in a manner the completion of his system, his working out of the ideal as present in the real. The ethical end is taken to be the idea of humanity, not in the abstract as formulated by Immanuel Kant, but in the context of the state and of history. Law is treated throughout as the vehicle of ethical requirements. In Trendelenburg's treatment of the state, as the ethical organism in which the individual (the potential man) may be said first to emerge into actuality, we may trace his nurture on the best ideas of Hellenic antiquity. ===Fischer–Trendelenburg debate=== In 1865 he became involved in an acrimonious controversy on the interpretation of Kant's doctrine of space with Kuno Fischer, whom he attacked in Kuno Fischer und sein Kant (1869), which drew forth the reply Anti-Trendelenburg (1870). The controversy became known in the history of philosophy as the Fischer–Trendelenburg debate. Trendelenburg's position on the debate (the position that \\"Kant may establish that space and time are a priori and intuitive conditions for experience in the \\"Transcendental Aesthetic,\\" but this in no way entails that space and time have nothing to do with the objects outside of possible experience\\") has been variously dubbed as \\"Neglected Alternative,\\" \\"Trendelenburg's gap\\" [die trendelenburgische Lücke], \\"Pistorius's gap [die pistorische Lücke]\\" (named after Hermann Andreas Pistorius), or \\"third possibility\\" [die dritte Möglichkeit].Andrew F.

The bridge was intended to have been built at the beginning of the 1940s, but it wasn't finished then: only a few columns were built. Instead for the motorway a provisional route through the valley was constructed. In the 50 years to follow its construction was cancelled due to its location near the former border between the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany. After the 1990 German reunification, traffic increased considerably, and in 1992 construction of a new bridge was started. One of the old columns was kept as a monument.

The paról is one of the most iconic and beloved symbols, of the Filipino holiday observance. Christmas in the Philippines (), one of two predominantly Catholic countries in Asia (the other one being East Timor), is one of the biggest holidays in the country. The country celebrates the world's longest Christmas season, with Christmas carols heard as early as September and lasting variously until either Epiphany, the Feast of the Black Nazarene on January 9, or the Feast of the Santo Niño on the third Sunday of January. The official observance by the Catholic Church in the Philippines is from the beginning of the Simbang Gabi on December 16 until the Feast of the Epiphany on the first Sunday after the New Year. Every year, Filipinos from around the world mark September 1 as the beginning of the countdown to Christmas. This countdown, which spans from September to December, otherwise known as the \\"Ber Months\\", is one of the most important traditions that makes the world's earliest and longest timespan of a Christmas season. The Christmas season gradually starts from September to December and ends in the third or fourth week of January. It is celebrated for almost half a year (4 months and 3–4 weeks or 5 months). Generally, holiday decorations are available as early as the National Heroes' Day weekend in August. But for the Iglesia Filipina Independiente or Aglipayans, Christmas starts on the eve of December 24 and ends on New Year's Day on January 1. ==Activities== The various ethnic groups in the Philippines each observe different Christmas traditions, and the following are generally common. == Christmas traditions == ===Simbang Gabi/Misa de Gallo=== Simbang Gabi (\\"Night Mass\\"; Spanish: Misa de Gallo, \\"Rooster's Mass\\", or Misa de Aguinaldo, \\"Gift Mass\\") is a novena of dawn Masses from December 16–24 (Christmas Eve). The Simbang Gabi is practised mainly by Catholic and Aglipayans, with some Evangelical Christian and independent Protestant churches having adopted the practise of having pre- Christmas dawn services. Attending the Masses is meant to show devotion to God and heightened anticipation for Christ's birth, and folk belief holds that God grants the special wish of a devotee that hears all nine Masses. Morning observance of Simbang Gabi this holiday begins as early as 03:00 PST, while in some parishes, anticipated Masses begin the previous evening at 20:00 PST or as early as 19:30 PST in others. After hearing Mass, Catholic families buy traditional Filipino holiday fare for breakfast outside the church and eat it either within the church precincts or at home. Vendors offer many native delicacies, including bibingka (rice flour and egg-based cake, cooked using coal burners above and under); putò bumbóng (a purple, sticky rice delicacy steamed in bamboo tubes, buttered then sprinkled with brown sugar and shredded dried coconut meat). Drinks include coffee, salabát (ginger tea) and tsokolate (thick, Spanish-style hot chocolate). Some Aglipayan churches invite the congregation to partake of the \\"paínit\\" (literally, \\"heater\\"), a post-Mass snack of mostly rice pastries served with coffee or cocoa at the house of the Mass sponsor. The bibingka and putò bumbóng are also served to those attending the anticipated evening Masses together with dinner. === Christmas Eve === For Filipinos, Christmas Eve (\\"Bisperas ng Pasko\\") on December 24 is celebrated with the Midnight Mass, and the traditional Noche Buena feast. Family members dine together at around midnight on traditional yuletide fare, which includes: queso de bola (Filipino Spanish for \\"ball of cheese\\", which is made of edam sealed in red paraffin wax); tsokoláte, noodles and pasta, fruit salad, pandesal, relleno and hamón (Christmas ham). Some families would also open presents at this time. ====Panunulúyan==== In different provinces and schools, the journey of Joseph and the pregnant Virgin Mary in search of lodging is re- enacted. The pageant, traditionally called the \\"Panunulúyan\\", \\"Pananawágan\\", or \\"Pananapátan\\", is modeled after the Spanish Las Posadas. The Panunulúyan is performed after dark, with the actors portraying Joseph and the Virgin Mary going to pre-designated houses. They perform a chant meant to rouse the \\"owners of the house\\" (also actors) to request for lodging. The owners then cruelly turn them away, sometimes also in song, saying that their house is already filled with other guests. Finally, Joseph and Mary make their way to the parish church where a replica of the stable has been set up. The birth of Jesus is celebrated at midnight with the Misa de Gallo. ===Christmas Day=== Christmas Day in the Philippines is primarily a family affair. The Misa de Gallo is celebrated on December 25 and is usually one of several Masses that all family members (including non-churchgoers) are present. The Misa de Gallo is often celebrated between 10 pm and midnight, a schedule preferred by many Filipinos who stay up late on Christmas Eve for the night-long celebration of the Noche Buena. Preferably in the morning, Filipinos typically visit their extended family, especially to pay their respects to senior relatives. This custom of giving respect is enacted through the \\"Págmamáno\\". A supplicant takes the back of an elder's hand and presses it against the forehead, while giving the greeting, Máno, pô (lit. \\"[Thy] hand, please\\"). The elder often responds by reciting a blessing or simply acknowledging the gesture, and in return gives \\"Aguinaldo\\" or money in the form of crisp banknotes, often placed in a sealed envelope such as an ang pao. Godparents in particular are socially obligated to give presents or aguinaldo to their godchildren, to whom they often give larger amounts compared to other younger relatives. A festive lunch may follow the \\"Págmamáno\\". The menu is heavily dependent upon the finances of the family, with richer families preparing grand feasts, while poorer families choose to cook simple yet special dishes. Some families choose to open presents on this day after the lunch. When nighttime falls, members of the family usually return home or linger to drink, play parlour games, and chat. Some may opt to have another feast for dinner, while a minority spend the entire day at home to rest after the previous days' festivities. ===Niños Inocentes=== Holy Innocents' Day or Childermas is commemorated on December 28 as Niños Inocentes. Filipinos once celebrated the day by playing practical jokes on one another, similar to April Fool's Day.http://www.philstar.com/funfare/article.aspx?articleid=536184&publicationsubcategoryid;=70 One of the widely practised pranks on this day is to borrow money without the intention of paying back. Creditors are usually helpless in getting remuneration from borrower, and are instead forewarned not to lend money on this day. Victims of such pranks were once called out, \\"Na-Niños Inocentes ka!\\" ===New Year's Eve=== On December 31 (Bisperas ng Bagong Taón), Filipino families gather for the Media Noche a lavish midnight feast that supposedly symbolises their hopes for prosperity in the coming year, and lasts until the following morning as with the Noche Buena taken on Christmas Eve. Filipinos make noise both to greet the New Year and in the belief that the din exorcises their surroundings of malevolent spirits. In spite of the yearly ban (due to the national government restrictions), people in most towns and cities customarily light firecrackers, or employ safer methods of merrymaking such as banging on pots and pans and blowing car horns. Other traditions and beliefs include encouraging children to jump at the stroke of midnight to increase their height; displaying circular fruit such as oranges; wearing clothes with dots and other circular designs to symbolise coins and money; eating twelve grapes at midnight for good luck in the twelve months of the year (a Spanish custom); and opening all windows and doors to let in the blessings on the first day of the year. ===Three Kings' Day=== Christmas officially ends on the Feast of the Epiphany, more commonly known as Three Kings' Day (Spanish: Día de los Tres Reyes; Tagalog: Araw ng Tatlóng Harì), which falls on the first Sunday of January. A dying tradition is the Hispanic custom of children leaving their shoes out by the window or the door, so that the Three Kings can leave small gifts like candy or money inside upon their descent on Twelfth Night. ===Feast of the Black Nazarene=== The miraculous Black Nazarene, whose devotees are primarily centered in Manila and Cagayan de Oro, is borne in procession on January 9 after a novena in its honor. The date commemorates the image's 1787 Traslación (solemn transfer) from its original location in what is now Rizal Park to its present shrine in the Quiapo District of the city. ===Feast of the Santo Niño=== The latest date for the end of popular Christmas celebrations is the Feast of the Santo Niño (Christ Child) on the third Sunday of January. The image depiction most associated with this day is the purportedly miraculous Santo Niño de Cebú, the first Christian icon brought to the islands. In 1521, Ferdinand Magellan came to Cebú and gave the image as a present to Humamay, chief consort of the local monarch, Raja Humabon, when she, together with her husband and a number of his subjects, were baptised into the Catholic faith. Tradition holds that Humamay—who received the Christian name Juana after Joan of Castile—danced for joy upon receiving the Santo Niño, providing a legendary origin for the fervent religious dancing during the Sinulog held in honor of the Christ Child. Celebrations are mostly focused in Cebu, where the Sinulog Festival is held, while there are other celebrations held nationwide in its honor, including the Ati-Atihan Festival in Aklan Province, the Dinagyang in Ilolio, the Kahimunan in Butuan, and the feasts of the Holy Child in the districts of Tondo and Pandacan in Manila. The National Cathedral or the Central Church of the Iglesia Filipina Independiente or Aglipayans is dedicated to the Santo Niño and other several parishes and missions around the country. ===The Feast of Our Lady of the Candles=== In older traditions (which are still kept in the liturgical calendar of the Extraordinary Form of the Mass) Christmas lasted until Candlemas, or the Feast of the Purification of Mary and the Presentation of the Baby Jesus at the Temple. This marked the end of a long 40-day \\"Christmastide\\" corresponding to the 40 days of Lent. This date falls on February 2, after Mary had participated in a rite of purification in according to the ancient Candlemas festival rooted in Halakha (Jewish law). This is also when Simeon makes his well-known prophecy to Mary and Joseph about the Holy Child, of Jesus being a light for the Gentiles. Many parishes, if possible will still keep their nativity scenes displayed up until the celebration of the Presentation of the Lord on February 2. This final salvo is marked by the Feast of Our Lady of the Candles in Jaro, Iloilo City, where the image is enshrined in the Jaro Cathedral, the National Shrine of Our Lady of the Candles, where Tridentine Masses are celebrated in commemoration. Similar celebrations are held nationwide in towns where Our Lady of the Candles is its patroness, including Candelaria, Quezon, whose town fiesta is celebrated on this date. ==Decorations== Due to Americanisation, decorations such as Santa Claus, Christmas trees, tinsel, faux evergreens, reindeer, and snow have become popular. Christmas lights are strung about in festoons, as the tail of the Star of Bethlehem in Belens, star shapes, Christmas trees, angels, and in a large variety of other ways, going as far as draping the whole outside of the house in lights. Despite these, the Philippines still retains its traditional decorations. ===Paról=== A paról decorated with an intricate design, often lit during the evening Every Christmas season, Filipino homes and buildings are adorned with star-shaped lanterns, called paról from the Spanish farol, meaning \\"lantern\\" or \\"lamp\\".'Merriam Webster – English English- Spanish Dictionary These lanterns represent the Star of Bethlehem that guided the Magi, also known as the Three Kings (Tagalog: Tatlóng Harì). Parol are as beloved and iconic to Filipinos as Christmas trees are to Westerners. The most common form of the lantern is a 5-pointed star with two \\"tails\\" at the lower two tips. Other popular variations are four, eight, and ten-pointed stars, while rarer ones sport six, seven, nine, and more than twelve points. The earliest parols were made from simple materials like bamboo, Japanese rice paper (known as \\"papél de Hapón\\") or crêpe paper, and were lit by a candle or coconut oil lamp. Simple parols can be easily constructed with just ten bamboo sticks, paper, and glue. Present-day parol has endless possible shapes and forms and is made of a variety of materials, such as cellophane, plastic, rope, capiz shell, glass, and even recycled refuse. Parol-making is a folk craft, and many Filipino children often craft them as a school project or for leisure. The Giant Lantern Festival is an annual festival held the Saturday before Christmas Eve in the San Fernando City, Pampanga. The festival features a competition of giant lanterns, and the popularity of the festival, has earned the city the moniker, \\"Christmas Capital of the Philippines\\". ===Belén=== A Nativity Scene in Ibaan, Batangas Another traditional Filipino Christmas symbol is the belén—a creche or tableau depicting the Birth of Christ. Derived from the Spanish name for Bethlehem, Belén, it depicts the infant Jesus in the manger, surrounded by the Virgin Mary, St. Joseph, the shepherds, their flock, the Magi and some stable animals, and is surmounted by an angel, the Star or both. Belén can be seen in homes, churches, schools and even office buildings; the ones on office buildings can be extravagant, using different materials for the figures and using Christmas lights, parols for the Star, and painted background scenery. A notable outdoor belén in Metro Manila is the one that used to be at the COD building in Cubao, Quezon City. In 2003, the belén was transferred to the Greenhills Shopping Center in San Juan when the COD building closed down. This belén is a lights and sounds presentation, the story being narrated over speakers set up and most probably using automatons to make the figures move up and down, or turn, etc. Each year, the company owning it changes the theme from the Nativity Story, with variations such as a fairground story, and Santa Claus' journey. Tarlac City, Tarlac is known as the \\"Belén Capital of the Philippines\\" holds the annual \\"Belenísmo sa Tarlac\\". It is a belén-making contest which is participated by establishments and residents in Tarlac. Giant versions of the belén with different themes are displayed in front of the establishments and roads of Tarlac for the entire season. ==Caroling== In the Philippines, children in small groups go from house to house singing Christmas carols, which they called pangangaroling. Makeshift instruments include tambourines made with tansans (aluminum bottle caps) strung on a piece of wire. With the traditional chant of \\"Namamasko po!\\", these carolers wait expectantly for the homeowners to reward them with coins. Afterward, the carolers thank the generous homeowners by singing \\"Thank you, thank you, ang babait ninyo (you are so kind), thank you!\\" An example of a traditional Filipino carol is a part of series known as \\"Maligayang Pasko\\", which is commonly called \\"Sa maybahay ang aming bati\\". The tradition of carols stems from the long years of Spanish rule, in which traditions practiced in Spanish Latin America during this time of the year were adopted to suit Philippine conditions. ==Aguinaldo== This is a word heard repeatedly during the Christmas Season in the Philippines. Presently, the term is interpreted as gift or money received from benefactors. Aguinaldo is a Spanish term for bonus. Its prevalent use may have originated from Filipino workers of the Spanish era, receiving extra pay from the generosity of the rich employers during the celebration of the Christmas season. ==See also== ==References== ==External links== *Christmas in the Philippines *History of Philippine Parols *Traditional and Modern Philippine Parols Category:Philippine culture ","title":"Christmas in the Philippines"},{"id":"1284880","text":"Trendelenburg could refer to: *Friedrich Adolf Trendelenburg (1802-1872), German philosopher and philologist *His son, Friedrich Trendelenburg (1844-1924), German surgeon *Trendelenburg gait *Trendelenburg position *Trendelenburg test *Trendelenburg's sign *Trendelenburg's operation - great saphenous vein ligation as a treatment of varicose veins.

Critics, including Leonard S. Davidow,Verne, Classic Romances of Literature: Michel Strogoff, Forward consider it one of Verne's best books. Davidow wrote, \\"Jules Verne has written no better book than this, in fact it is deservedly ranked as one of the most thrilling tales ever written.\\" Unlike some of Verne's other novels, it is not science fiction, but a scientific phenomenon (Leidenfrost effect) is a plot device. The book was later adapted to a play, by Verne himself and Adolphe d'Ennery. Incidental music to the play was written by Alexandre Artus in 1880. The book has been adapted several times for films, television and cartoon series. == Plot summary == 230px Journey across Siberia Michael Strogoff, a 30-year-old native of Omsk, is a courier for Tsar Alexander II of Russia. The Tartar Khan (prince), Feofar Khan, incites a rebellion and separates the Russian Far East from the mainland, severing telegraph lines. Rebels encircle Irkutsk, where the local governor, a brother of the Tsar, is making a last stand. Strogoff is sent to Irkutsk to warn the governor about the traitor Ivan Ogareff, a former colonel, who was once demoted and exiled and now seeks revenge against the imperial family. He intends to gain the governor's trust and then betray him to the Tartar hordes. An illustration from the novel Michael Strogoff: The Courier of the Czar drawn by Jules Férat. On his way to Irkutsk, Strogoff meets Nadia Fedor, daughter of an exiled political prisoner, Basil Fedor, who has been granted permission to join her father at his exile in Irkutsk; the English war correspondent Harry Blount of the Daily Telegraph; and Alcide Jolivet, a Frenchman reporting for his 'cousin Madeleine'. Blount and Jolivet tend to follow the same route as Michael, separating and meeting again all the way through Siberia. He is supposed to travel under a false identity, posing as the pacific merchant Nicolas Korpanoff, but he is discovered by the Tartars when he meets his mother in their home city of Omsk. Michael, his mother and Nadia are eventually captured by the Tartar forces, along with thousands of other Russians, during the storming of a city in the Ob basin. The Tartars do not know Strogoff by sight, but Ogareff is aware of the courier's mission and when he is told that Strogoff's mother spotted her son in the crowd and called his name, but received no reply, he understands that Strogoff is among the captured and devises a scheme to force the mother to indicate him. Strogoff is indeed caught and handed over to the Tartars, and Ogareff alleges that Michael is a spy, hoping to have him put to death in some cruel way. After opening the Koran at random, Feofar decides that Michael will be blinded as punishment in the Tartar fashion, with a glowing hot blade. For several chapters the reader is led to believe that Michael was indeed blinded, but it transpires in fact that he was saved from this fate (his tears at his mother evaporated and saved his corneas) and was only pretending. Eventually, Michael and Nadia escape, and travel to Irkutsk with a friendly peasant, Nicolas Pigassof. They are recaptured by the Tartars; Nicolas witnesses Nadia being raped by a Tartar soldier and murders Nadia's assaulter. The Tartars then abandon Nadia and Michael and carry Nicolas away, reserving him for a greater punishment. Nadia and Michael later discover him buried up to his neck in the ground. They continue onwards where they are delayed by fire and the frozen river. However, they eventually reach Irkutsk, and warn the Tsar's brother in time of Ivan Ogareff. Nadia's father, who has been appointed commander of a suicide battalion and later pardoned, joins them and Michael and Nadia are married. == Sources of information == Exact sources of Verne's quite accurate knowledge of contemporary Eastern Siberia remain disputed. One popular version connects it to the novelist's meetings with anarchist Peter Kropotkin; however, Kropotkin arrived in France after Strogoff was published. Another, more likely source, could have been Siberian businessman Mikhail Sidorov. Sidorov presented his collection of natural resources, including samples of oil and oil shales from Ukhta area, together with photographs of Ukhta oil wells, at the 1873 World Exhibition in Vienna, where he could have met Verne.Fuks, Matveychuk, pp. 371-373 Real-world oil deposits in Lake Baikal region do exist, first discovered in 1902 in Barguzin Bay and Selenge River delta,Fuks, Matveychuk, pp. 374-375 but they are nowhere near the commercial size depicted by Verne.Fuks, Matveychuk, p. 372 Verne's publisher Pierre-Jules Hetzel sent the manuscript of the novel to the Russian writer Ivan Turgenev in August 1875 asking him for his comments on the accuracy of the conditions described in the book.I.S. Turgenev, Polnoe sobranie sochinenii i pisem v 30 tomakh: Pis'ma, vol. 14 (1875) (Moscow, 2003), p. 136. While the physical description of Siberia is accurate, the Tartar rebellion described was not a rebellion and the strength as well as the geographical reach of the Tartars is highly exaggerated. After the Khanates had been gradually pushed back further South earlier in the 19th century, in 1865-68 Russia had conquered the weakened Central Asian Uzbek Khanates of Kokand and Bukhhara, both located much further South than the cities through which Strogoff travelled in the novel. While there thus had been war between Russia and \\"Tartars\\" a few years before Jules Verne wrote Michael Strogoff, no Tartar Khan at the time was in a position to act as Feofar is described as doing; depicting late 19th Century Tartars as able to face Russians on anything resembling equal terms is an anachronism. == Screen Adaptations == { class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text-align: left; margin-right: 0;\\" width=100% ! scope=\\"col\\" Title ! scope=\\"col\\" Year ! scope=\\"col\\" Country ! scope=\\"col\\" Director ! scope=\\"col\\" Strogoff ! scope=\\"col\\" Notes ! scope=\\"col\\" Refs -  Michael Strogoff  1914  US  Lloyd B.

Similar to the book, in the game players are couriers racing across Russia to thwart the assassination plot by Count Ivan Ogareff. Players will race one another but will also race the Count, who moves across Russia on a separate track. Along the way, players must face and overcome troubles such as bears and bad weather, avoid the spy Sangarra who tries to delay their progress, and avoid capture by the Tartar forces who conspire with Count Ogareff. Players must balance the racing element of the game, resting enough to preserve health, and dealing with the troubles they face along the way before crisis ensues. The game usually ends when a player confronts Ogareff in Irkusk and a showdown ensues. The game is highly thematic and true to the novel, with artwork that draws on traditional Russian carving techniques from the era.

He was son of the philosopher Friedrich Adolf Trendelenburg, father of the pharmacologist Paul Trendelenburg and grandfather of the pharmacologist Ullrich Georg Trendelenburg. Trendelenburg was born in Berlin and studied medicine at the University of Glasgow and the University of Edinburgh. He completed his studies at the Charité - Universitätsmedizin Berlin under Bernhard von Langenbeck, receiving his doctorate in 1866. He practiced medicine at the University of Rostock and the University of Bonn. In 1895 he became surgeon-in-chief at the University of Leipzig. Trendelenburg was interested in the history of surgery.

After players have passed each of the number of checkpoints in order, the course is completed. Dash has multiplayer support, and can connect with 6 different devices. ==Gameplay== Dash is a racing video game in which the player uses a stylus to control a Pikachu and race through checkpoints. After players have passed each of the number of checkpoints in order, the course is completed. The stylus is used by moving the stylus in the direction you want Pikachu to run. Along with racing on the ground, there are races in the sky using balloons. There are many different terrains such as mazestone paths, forests, beaches, water, swamp, and lava pools. Throughout the courses are power ups which allow the player to run on different terrains without slowing down. Dash also features a training cup, which is given to players starting the game for the first time. After completing the training cup, the player has the chance to play in the Grand Prix Mode. There are five main cups to compete in GP mode. Dash also offers harder GP modes that can be unlocked, which put the player against a faster level of Pokémon. Each cup has five courses within its area. ===Connectivity to other devices=== Dash has multiplayer support. Up to six Nintendo DS units can be connected together. Dash features compatibility with the Game Boy Advance games Pokémon Ruby, Sapphire, FireRed, LeafGreen, or Emerald. If the player inserts any of those cartridges in Slot 2, and has completed GP mode, he or she can play courses shaped like the Pokémon in their team. The time to complete the courses depends on factors like type and level. ==Development== Dash was developed for the Nintendo DS by Ambrella, who also developed Hey You, Pikachu! and Pokémon Channel. It was first revealed October 7, 2004, as a launch title for Japan. Dash was released in Japan on December 2, 2004; Europe on March 11, 2005; North America on March 13, 2005; and Australia April 7, 2005. Before the North American release, The Pokémon Center had pre-order deals which included key chains and DS carrying pouches. ==Reception== The game received generally negative reviews, having an aggregate score of 46/100 on Metacritic, and a score of 49 on GameRankings. IGN's Craig Harris rated the game 5/10 because the player could only play as Pikachu in single player, and could also be finished within hours. GameSpot's Alex Navarro rated the game 5.2/10 stating Dash \\"is simply one of the laziest uses of the DS's touch screen technology to date\\". GamePro's Slo Mo rated the game 3.5/5 stating \\"Dash might not make much of a splash, but it should be a good kid-pleaser.\\" GameSpy's Phil Theobald rated the game 2/5 stating \\"Gimmicky titles like this may be cute diversions, but they're no substitute for the real deal.\\" Electronic Gaming Monthly gave the game 58/100, calling it \\"A cute and fun little racing game that has a great multiplayer component, but there's simply not enough to it.\\" Nintendo Power rated the game 56/100, stating \\"Controlling Pikachu with stylus strokes is actually quite fun, but as a racing game, Dash isn't fully realized.\\" Game Informer rated the game 55/100, stating \\"Don't think of it so much as a game, but more as an exercise in anger management.\\" While discussing the mixed quality of Pokémon spin-offs, Retronauts cited Pokémon Dash as an example.

The place - consisting of the villages Huntlosen, Ahlhorn and Großenkneten - is still mostly agrarian, but is becoming more and more popular as a place of residence for commuters to Oldenburg. ==Neighborhoods== Großenkneten is divided in 19 neighborhoods (Ortsteile), which are (with population of 2012): Ahlhorn (6.441), Amelhausen (120), Bakenhus (48), Bissel (319), Döhlen (461), Großenkneten (2.637), Hagel (32), Halenhorst (237), Haschenbrok (79), Hengstlage (136), Hespenbusch- Pallast (78), Hosüne (569), Huntlosen (1.831), Husum (60), Sage (623), Sage- Haast (290), Sannum (217), Steinloge (128) and Westrittrum (106). ==History== In 1933 the municipality Huntlosen was incorporated into Großenkneten, giving it its current extent. Between 1952 and 1957 Karl Poggensee and his association DAFRA (the precursor of the Hermann Oberth Society) operated a small launch site for experimental rockets close to the Hespenbusch farm.

Instead, in a form of supply chain management, it transfers the orders and their shipment details to either the manufacturer, a wholesaler, another retailer, or a fulfillment house, which then ships the goods directly to the customer. As such, the retailer is responsible for marketing and selling a product, but has little or no control over product quality, storage, inventory management, or shipping.‘It’s bullshit’: Inside the weird, get-rich-quick world of dropshipping - Sirin Kale, Wired, 1 May 2020 This eliminates the costs of maintaining a warehouse - or even a brick and mortar storefront, purchasing and storing inventory, and employing necessary staff for such functions. As in any other form of retail, the seller makes their profit on the difference between an item's wholesale and retail price, less any pertinent selling, merchant, or shipping fees accruing to them. ==Procedure== A drop shipping business model does not require a brick and mortar store. It may be eliminated entirely, or combined with drop shipped order fulfillment. A physical retailer may keep potential drop-shipped items on display, provide details on mail order items via a catalogue, or maintain a website with information available only online. A virtual retailer only has a website. Drop-shipping retailers are not required to disclose the practice, nor, as with any other retailer, the wholesale source of the products they offer. This can be achieved by \\"blind shipping\\" (shipping merchandise without a return address corresponding to the seller), \\"private label shipping\\" (having merchandise shipped from the wholesaler with a return address customized to the retailer), or utilizing a fulfillment house. The ultimate order fullfiller might also include a customized packing slip, including details such as the retailer's company name, logo, and contact information. In unusual circumstances drop shipping can occur when a small retailer (that typically sells in small quantities to the general public) receives a single large order for a product. The retailer may arrange for the goods to be shipped directly to the customer from the manufacturer or distributor. Drop shipping is common with expensive products. Sellers on online auction sites such as eBay also use drop shipping as way of distributing products without handling the stocking the items sold. A seller will list an item as new, and have purchased items shipped directly from the wholesaler to the customer. The seller's profit is the difference between the selling and the wholesale prices, minus any pertinent selling, merchant, or shipping fees accruing to them. Products may be listed by a drop-shipping retailer as available but actually be back-ordered either with the wholesaler or the item's manufacturer. Such potential delays in order fulfillment are not always known, or even when known disclosed, by a seller. They also can be extended, beyond the control of the seller. Likewise order fulfillment and shipping delays are beyond the seller's control, yet can reflect badly on the purchaser's ultimate satisfaction with their transaction. This puts a premium on timely and accurate information provision by the seller on both sides of the purchase, both before and after it is made. ==Developments== Since 2006, many drop ship companies have emerged in China, many of which offer wholesale and drop shipping services to both companies and individuals. This is largely due to the increasing ease of e-procurement and the growing part that the internet is playing in commerce. Drop ship suppliers based in China have increasingly been able to compete with same-country distributors because of improved logistics for small packets and the easing of trade barriers. ==Scams== Drop shipping has also featured prominently in Internet-based home business scams. Scam artists will promote drop shipping as a lucrative \\"work from home opportunity\\". The victim of the scam will be sold a list of businesses from which drop shipment orders can be placed. These businesses may not be wholesalers, but other businesses or individuals acting as middlemen between retailers and wholesalers, with no product of their own to sell. These middlemen often charge prices that leave little profit margin for the victim and require a regular fee for the retailer's use of their services. In 2018, Gimlet media podcast Reply All investigated the drop-shipping phenomenon. The journalists explored the way that drop-shippers micro-targetAttack of the micro brand, medium.com their client, but also found that micro-shipping itself is a rather dubious industry in that, despite the promises of some of the most well-known drop-shipping acolytes, few drop-shippers actually make any profits.\\"Worlds most expensive free watch\\", gimletmedia.com In 2016, Buzzfeed published an article exposing unscrupulous drop-shippers in China. The article described how customers were receiving products that were not as advertised, or not receiving any product. One effect of drop shipping is that customers who receive a drop-shipped package will realize that they overpaid for the item on eBay, return the item to the seller, then reorder the identical item directly from the manufacturer. The cost of processing the return and the loss of the unsellable returned product can result in significant losses to the drop-shipper.Why It's Nearly Impossible to Stop This Amazon and eBay Scheme, Jason Feifer, Entrepreneur == See also == * Fulfillment house * Logistics * Mail forwarding * Mail order * Order fulfillment *Will call == References == Category:Retail processes and techniques Category:Supply chain management ","title":"Drop shipping"},{"id":"1284945","text":"Hespenbusch is a farm, which belongs to the municipality of Grossenkneten.

As it is present in a large range, it has been listed as Near Threatened on the IUCN Red List since 2015. The marbled cat was once considered to belong to the pantherine lineage of cats. It is closely related to the Asian golden cat (Catopuma temminckii) and the bay cat (C. badia), all of which diverged from other felids about 9.4 million years ago. ==Characteristics== The marbled cat is similar in size to a domestic cat, but has rounded ears and a very long tail that is as long as the cat's head and body. The ground colour of its long fur varies from brownish-grey to ochreous brown above and greyish to buff below. It is patterned with black stripes on the short and round head, on the neck and back. On the tail, limbs and underbelly it has solid spots. On the flanks it has irregular dark-edged blotches that fuse to dark areas and look like a 'marbled' pattern. Its paws are webbed between the digits and are completely sheathed. Its coat is thick and soft. Spots on the forehead and crown merge into narrow longitudinal stripes on the neck, and irregular stripes on the back. The legs and underparts are patterned with black dots, and the tail is marked with black spots proximally and rings distally. It has large feet and unusually large canine teeth, resembling those of the big cats, although these appear to be the result of parallel evolution. Marbled cats range from in head-body length with a long and thickly furred tail that indicates the cat's adaptation to an arboreal lifestyle, where the tail is used as a counterbalance. Recorded weights vary between . ==Distribution and habitat== The marbled cat occurs along the eastern Himalayan foothills and in tropical Indomalaya eastward into southwest China, and on the islands of Sumatra and Borneo. It is primarily associated with moist and mixed deciduous- evergreen tropical forests. Its distribution in India is confined to the north-eastern forests. In eastern Nepal, a marbled cat was recorded for the first time in January 2018, outside a protected area in the Kangchenjunga landscape at an altitude of . In northeast India, marbled cats were recorded in Eaglenest Wildlife Sanctuary, Dampa and Pakke Tiger Reserves, Balpakram- Baghmara landscape and Singchung-Bugun Village Community Reserve in Arunachal Pradesh between January 2013 and March 2018. In Bhutan, it has been recorded in Royal Manas National Park, and in broadleaved and mixed conifer forests at elevations up to in Jigme Dorji National Park and Wangchuck Centennial National Park. In Thailand, it was recorded in a hill evergreen bamboo mixed forest in Phu Khieu Wildlife Sanctuary. In Borneo, it has also been recorded in peat swamp forest. The population size of the marbled cat is not well understood. Few records were obtained during camera-trapping surveys throughout much of its range. In three areas in Sabah, the population density was estimated at 7.1 to 19.6 individuals per , an estimate that may be higher than elsewhere in the cat's range. In Kalimantan, marbled cats were recorded in mixed swamp forest and tall interior forest at altitudes below in the vicinity of Sabangau National Park between 2008 and 2018. == Behaviour and ecology == Marbled cats recorded in northeastern India and Kalimantan on Borneo were active by day. The first-ever radio-tracked marbled cat had an overall home range of at an elevation of and was active primarily during nocturnal and crepuscular times. Marbled cats recorded in northeast India were active during the day with activity peaks around noon. Forest canopies probably provide the marbled cat with much of its prey: birds, squirrels and other rodents, and reptiles. In the Bukit Barisan Selatan National Park, a marbled cat was observed in a dense forest patch in an area also used by siamang. In Thailand, one individual has been observed in Phu Khieo Wildlife Sanctuary preying on a Phayre's leaf monkey. A few marbled cats have been bred in captivity, with gestation estimated to be 66 to 82 days. In the few recorded instances, two kittens were born in each litter, and weighed from . Their eyes open at around 12 days, and the kittens begin to take solid food at two months, around the time that they begin actively climbing. Marbled cats reach sexual maturity at 21 or 22 months of age, and have lived for up to 12 years in captivity. == Threats == Indiscriminate snaring is prevalent throughout much of its range, and likely poses a major threat. It is valued for its skin, meat, and bones, but infrequently observed in the illegal Asian wildlife trade. During a survey in the Lower Subansiri District of Arunachal Pradesh, a marbled cat was encountered that had been killed by a local hunter for a festival celebrated by the indigenous Apatani community in March and April every year. The dead cat was used in a ceremony, and its blood was sacrificed to the deity for goodwill of their family and for ensuring a good harvest, protection from wildlife, disease and pest. Deforestation is a further threat to the marbled cat. ==Conservation== Pardofelis marmorata is included in CITES Appendix I and protected over parts of its range. Hunting is prohibited in Bangladesh, Cambodia, Yunnan, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, Nepal, and Thailand. Hunting is regulated in Laos and Singapore. In Bhutan and Brunei, the marbled cat is not legally protected outside protected areas. No information about protection status is available from Cambodia and Vietnam.Nowell, K. and Jackson, P. (1996). Marbled Cat Felis marmorata. in: Wild Cats. Status Survey and Conservation Action Plan. IUCN/SSC Cat Specialist Group, Gland, Switzerland and Cambridge, UK. == Taxonomy == Felis marmorata was the scientific name proposed by William Charles Linnaeus Martin in 1836 for a skin of a male marbled cat from Java or Sumatra. Felis longicaudata proposed by Henri Marie Ducrotay de Blainville in 1843 was a zoological specimen from India or Cochinchina. Felis charltoni proposed by John Edward Gray in 1846 was a specimen from Darjeeling. The generic name Pardofelis was proposed by Nikolai Severtzov in 1858. At present, two subspecies are recognized as valid: *P. marmorata marmorata (Martin, 1836) – from the Malay Peninsula to Sumatra and Borneo *P. marmorata longicaudata (Blainville, 1843) – from Nepal to north of the Isthmus of Kra === Phylogeny === Results of a phylogenetic analysis indicate that the marbled cat diverged between 8.42 and 4.27 million years ago. Together with the Asian golden cat (Catopuma temminckii) and the bay cat (C. badia), it forms an evolutionary lineage that diverged between 12.77 and 7.36 million years ago. ==References== ==External links== * Category:Felines Category:Mammals of Bhutan Category:Mammals of Indonesia Category:Mammals of Thailand Category:Mammals of Cambodia Category:Mammals of Vietnam Category:Mammals of Laos Category:Fauna of Yunnan Category:Carnivorans of Malaysia Category:Fauna of Eastern Himalaya Category:Fauna of Southeast Asia Category:Mammals described in 1837 Category:Taxa named by William Charles Linnaeus Martin ","title":"Marbled cat"},{"id":"1284947","text":"Pardofelis is a genus of the cat family Felidae. This genus is defined as including one species native to Southeast Asia: the marbled cat. Two other species, formerly classified to this genus, now belong to the genus Catopuma. The word pardofelis is composed of the Latin words pardus pard, and felis cat in allusion to the spots of the type species, the marbled cat.Palmer, T. S.; Merriam, C. H. (1904). Index generum mammalium: a list of the genera and families of mammals. Government Printing Office, Washington. ==Taxonomic history== Pardofelis was first proposed by the Russian explorer and naturalist Nikolai Severtzov in 1858 as generic name comprising a single felid species occurring in tropical Asia, the marbled cat Pardofelis marmorata. The British zoologist Reginald Innes Pocock recognized the taxonomic classification of Pardofelis in 1917 as comprising not only the marbled cat but also the Borneo bay cat Pardofelis badia, because of similarities in the shape of their skulls. In 1939, he described Pardofelis marmorata on the basis of skins and skulls which originated in Java, Sumatra, Darjeeling and Sikkim. Until 2006, the classification of Pardofelis as a monotypic genus was widely accepted. Genetic analysis carried out at the turn of the century revealed a close genetic relationship with the Borneo bay cat Pardofelis badia and the Asian golden cat Pardofelis temminckii. All of them diverged from the other felids about , and have therefore been proposed to be placed in the genus Pardofelis. Meanwhile, Pardofelis is considered a synonym of Catopuma. The relationship between this branch and others on the feline family tree has also become clearer. Pardofelis species do not stem from the Pantherinae subfamily but belong to the other main branch of mostly smaller cat species, the Felinae. They share a more recent common ancestor with servals, caracals, and African golden cats than with any other existing cat genus. ==Characteristics== Pardofelis are small long-tailed, short-headed cats with rounded ears, distinguishable from Prionailurus and related Oriental genera by having the skull higher and more rounded, with the mesopterygoid fossa lanceolate in front and provided with thickened margins or a better developed external crest. The skull is short, broad, strongly convex in dorsal profile, not comparatively long and low. The nasal branch of the premaxilla is thin, not expanded, the summit of the muzzle is not compressed above, the maxilla is not expanded where it abuts against the nasal bone, and develops no excrescence outside the suborbital foramen. ==References== ==External links== Category:Felines Category:Mammals of Asia Category:Mammals of China Category:Mammals of India Category:Mammals of Nepal Category:Mammals of Bhutan Category:Mammals of Southeast Asia Category:Mammals of Thailand Category:Mammals of Indonesia Category:Carnivorans of Malaysia Category:Mammal genera Category:Taxa named by Nikolai Severtzov ","title":"Pardofelis"},{"id":"1284948","text":"Saipa may refer to: ==Organizations== * SAIPA, an Iranian automobile manufacturer * Saipa Diesel, an Iranian manufacturer of trucks and trailers * South African Institute of Professional Accountants, a professional association ==Sport== * Saipa F.C., an Iranian football team based in Karaj * Saipa Shomal Sari F.C., an Iranian football team based in Q'aemshahr * Saipa Cultural and Athletic Corporation, an Iranian multisport club based in Tehran and Karaj ** Saipa Tehran VC, an Iranian volleyball club formerly known as Saipa Alborz VC * SaiPa, a Finnish ice hockey team ","title":"Saipa"},{"id":"1284953","text":"Tracing may refer to: == Computer graphics== * Image tracing, digital image processing to convert raster graphics into vector graphics * Path tracing, a method of rendering images of three-dimensional scenes such that the global illumination is faithful to reality * Ray tracing (graphics), techniques in computer graphics * Boundary tracing (also known as contour tracing), a segmentation technique that identifies the boundary pixels of the digital region ==Software Engineering== * Tracing (software), a method of debugging in computer programming * System monitoring * Application performance management ==Physics== * Ray tracing (physics), a method for calculating the path of waves or particles * Dye tracing, tracking various flows using dye added to the liquid in question ==Other uses== * Tracing (art), copying an object or drawing, especially with the use of translucent tracing paper * Tracing (criminology), determining crime scene activity from trace evidence left at crime scenes * Tracing (law), a legal process by which a claimant demonstrates what has happened to their property * Anterograde tracing, and Retrograde tracing, biological research techniques used to map the connections of neurons * Call tracing, a procedure that permits an entitled user to be informed about the routing of data for an established connection * Curve sketching, a process for determining the shape of a geometric curve * Family Tracing and Reunification, a process whereby disaster response teams locate separated family members * Tracking and tracing, a process of monitoring the location and status of property in transit * Curve tracing, a method for analyzing the characteristics of semiconductors; see Semiconductor curve tracer * Tracing (as with a gun or camera), tracking an object, as with the use of tracer ammunition * Contact tracing, finding and identifying people in contact with someone with an infectious disease ==See also== * * Trace (disambiguation) * Tracer (disambiguation) * Tracking (disambiguation) ","title":"Tracing"},{"id":"1284960","text":"The allowed cell rate is the rate in cells per second at which a source device may send data in ATM networks.

His works were published by the liberal wing of the Lithuanian cultural movement, and also in various Lithuanian newspapers and other outlets (such as Aušrinė, Rygos naujienos etc.). In 1914, he began studying literature in Saint Petersburg, and later in Moscow, due to World War I and the Russian Revolution. In 1921, he enrolled in the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich, where in 1924 he received his Ph.D for a doctoral thesis on Lithuanian folklore. After returning to Lithuania, Sruoga taught at the University of Lithuania, and established a theater seminar that eventually became a course of study. He also wrote various articles on literature. From 1930 he began writing dramas, first Milžino paunksmė, later Radvila Perkūnas, Baisioji naktis and Aitvaras teisėjas. In 1939, he began teaching at Vilnius University. ==Nazi captivity== ===Forest of the Gods=== Sruoga's best known work is the novel Forest of the Gods (Dievų miškas), based on his own life experiences as a prisoner in Stutthof concentration camp in Sztutowo, Free City of Danzig now present-day Nowy Dwór Gdański County, Pomeranian Voivodeship, Poland, where he was sent in March 1943 together with forty-seven other Lithuanian intellectuals after the Nazis started a campaign against possible anti-Nazi agitation in occupied Lithuania. In the book, Sruoga revealed life in a concentration camp through the eyes of a man whose only way to save his life and maintain his dignity was to view everything through a veil of irony and humor, where torturers and their victims are exposed as imperfect human beings, being far removed from the false ideals of their political leaders. For example, he wrote \\"A man is not a machine. He gets tired.\\", referring to the guards beating prisoners. Originally the novel was suppressed by the Soviet officials; it was ultimately published in 1957, ten years after the author's death. In 2005, a movie with the same titled as the book was released. The film \\"The Forest of the Gods\\" became the most profitable film released after Lithuania gained independence. ==Later life== After the Soviets liberated the Nazi camps, Sruoga continued to be held in the same camp. However, in 1945, he returned to Vilnius and continued teaching at Vilnius University, where he wrote the dramas Pajūrio kurortas and Barbora Radvilaitė. The authorities' refusal to publish Forest of The Gods and weak health resulting from his time in concentration camps led to his death in October 16, 1947.Baltic Online Lesson 2: Lithuanian The 2005 film Forest of the Gods was based on the book. ==References== ==External links== * Bibliography Category:1896 births Category:1947 deaths Category:20th-century dramatists and playwrights Category:20th-century poets Category:Lithuanian dramatists and playwrights Category:Lithuanian folklorists Category:Lithuanian poets Category:Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich alumni Category:Moscow State University alumni Category:People from Biržai District Municipality Category:People from Kovno Governorate Category:Saint Petersburg State University alumni Category:Stutthof concentration camp survivors Category:Vilnius University faculty Category:Vytautas Magnus University faculty ","title":"Balys Sruoga"},{"id":"1284973","text":"The Nile crocodile (Crocodylus niloticus) is a large crocodilian native to freshwater habitats in Africa, where it is present in 26 countries. Due to its widespread occurrence and stable population trend, it has been listed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List since 1996. It is widely distributed throughout sub-Saharan Africa, occurring mostly in the central, eastern, and southern regions of the continent, and lives in different types of aquatic environments such as lakes, rivers, swamps, and marshlands. Although capable of living in saline environments, this species is rarely found in saltwater, but occasionally inhabits deltas and brackish lakes. The range of this species once stretched northward throughout the Nile, as far north as the Nile delta. On average, the adult male Nile crocodile is between in length and weighs . However, specimens exceeding in length and weighing up to have been recorded. It is the largest freshwater predator in Africa, and may be considered the second-largest extant reptile in the world, after the saltwater crocodile (Crocodylus porosus).Wood, G. (1983). The Guinness Book of Animal Facts and Feats. Sterling Pub Co Inc. Sexual dimorphism is prevalent, and females are usually about 30% smaller than males. They have thick, scaly, heavily armoured skin. Nile crocodiles are opportunistic apex predators; a very aggressive species of crocodile, they are capable of taking almost any animal within their range. They are generalists, taking a variety of prey. Their diet consists mostly of different species of fish, reptiles, birds, and mammals. They are ambush predators that can wait for hours, days, and even weeks for the suitable moment to attack. They are agile predators and wait for the opportunity for a prey item to come well within attack range. Even swift prey are not immune to attack. Like other crocodiles, Nile crocodiles have an extremely powerful bite that is unique among all animals, and sharp, conical teeth that sink into flesh, allowing for a grip that is almost impossible to loosen. They can apply high levels of force for extended periods of time, a great advantage for holding down large prey underwater to drown. Nile crocodiles are relatively social crocodiles.Huchzermeyer, F. (2003). Crocodiles: Biology, Husbandry, Diseases. CABI International Publishing. UK and Massachusetts. They share basking spots and large food sources, such as schools of fish and big carcasses. Their strict hierarchy is determined by size. Large, old males are at the top of this hierarchy and have primary access to food and the best basking spots. Crocodiles tend to respect this order; when it is infringed, the results are often violent and sometimes fatal. Like most other reptiles, Nile crocodiles lay eggs; these are guarded by the females. The hatchlings are also protected for a period of time, but hunt by themselves and are not fed by the parents. The Nile crocodile is one of the most dangerous species of crocodile and is responsible for hundreds of human deaths every year. It is a rather common species of crocodile and is not endangered despite some regional declines or extinctions. ==Etymology== The binomial name Crocodylus niloticus is derived from the Greek κρόκη, kroke (\\"pebble\\"), δρῖλος, drilos (\\"worm\\"), referring to its rough skin; and niloticus, meaning \\"from the Nile River\\". The Nile crocodile is called tanin ha-yeor in Hebrew,Both words originate in the Bible. Yeor is the biblical name of the Nile. timsah al-nil in Arabic, mamba in Swahili, garwe in Shona, ngwenya in Ndebele, ngwena in Venda, and kwena in Sotho and Tswana. It also sometimes referred to as the African crocodile, Ethiopian crocodile, common crocodile, or the black crocodile.Stevenson-Hamilton, J. (1954). Wild life in South Africa. Cassell and Co., London. ==Taxonomy== Although no subspecies are currently formally recognized, as many as seven have been proposed, mostly due to variations in appearance and size noted in various populations through Africa. These have consisted of: C. n. africanus (informally named the East African Nile crocodile), C. n. chamses (or the West African Nile crocodile), C. n. cowiei (the South African Nile crocodile), C. n. madagascariensis (Malagasy or Madagascar Nile crocodile, regionally also known as the Croco Mada, which translates to Malagasy crocodile), C. n. niloticus (would be the nominate subspecies, or the Ethiopian Nile crocodile), C. n. pauciscutatus (Kenyan Nile crocodile), C. (n.) suchus (now widely perceived by crocodilian biologists as a separate species). In a study of the morphology of the various populations, including C. (n.) suchus, the appearance of the Nile crocodile sensu lato was found to be more variable than any other currently recognized crocodile species, and at least some of these variations were related to locality. A study on Lake Turkana in Kenya (informally this population would be placed in C. n. pauciscutatus) has shown that the local crocodiles appear to have more osteoderms in their ventral surface than other known populations, thus are of lesser value in leather trading, accounting for an exceptionally large (possibly overpopulated) local population there in the late 20th century. The segregation of the West African crocodile (C. suchus) from the Nile crocodile has been supported by morphological characteristics, studies of genetic materials and habitat preferences.Cunningham, S. W. (2015). Spatial and genetic analyses of Africa's sacred crocodile: Crocodylus suchus. ETD Collection for Fordham University. The separation of the two is not recognized by the IUCN as their last evaluations of the group was in 2008 and 2009,Fergusson, R. A. (2010). Nile crocodile Crocodylus niloticus. Crocodiles. Status Survey and Conservation Action Plan, 3rd edn (eds Manolis SC, Stevenson C), 84–89. years before the primary publications supporting the distinction of the West African crocodiles. DNA from West African crocodiles has indicated that, unlike the Nile crocodile, it is most closely related to East Asian species, such as the Philippine crocodile (Crocodylus mindorensis), than other extant crocodilians. At one time, the fossil species Rimasuchus lloydi was thought to be the ancestor of the Nile crocodile, but more recent research has indicated that Rimasuchus, despite its very large size (about 20–30% bigger than a Nile crocodile with a skull length estimated up to ), is more closely related to the dwarf crocodile (Osteolaemus tetraspis) among living species.Alderton, D. (1998). Crocodiles & alligators of the world. Cassell Illustrated, 978-0713723823.Storrs G. W. (2003). \\"Late Miocene-early Pliocene crocodilian fauna of Lothagam, Southwest Turkana basin, Kenya\\", in Leakey M. G. & Harris J. M. (eds), Lothagam: the Dawn of Humanity in Eastern Africa. Columbia University Press, New York. pp. 137–159. Other fossil species from Africa are retained in Crocodylus and appear to be closely related to the Nile crocodile: namely C. checchiai from the Miocene in Kenya, C. anthropophagus from Plio-Pleistocene Tanzania, and C. thorbjarnarsoni from Plio-Pleistocene Kenya. While C. checchiai was about the same size as the larger modern Nile crocodiles, and shared similar physical characteristics to the modern species; C. anthropophagus and C. thorbjarnarsoni were both somewhat larger, with projected total lengths up to . Also C. anthropophagus and C. thorbjarnarsoni, as well as Rimasuchus spp., were all relatively broad-snouted, as well as large, indicating a specialization at hunting sizeable prey, such as large mammals and freshwater turtles, the latter much larger than any in present-day Africa. Based on morphology, time, and placement of fossils, C. checchiai are thought to essentially form a link between the Nile crocodile and today's Neotropical crocodiles. The Nile crocodile apparently is more closely related to the crocodiles of the Americas, namely the American (Crocodylus acutus), Cuban (Crocodylus rhombifer), Morelet's (Crocodylus moreletii), and Orinoco crocodiles (Crocodylus intermedius), than to the West African crocodile or other extant African crocodilians. Dispersal across the Atlantic is thought to have occurred 5 to 6 million years ago. ==Characteristics and physiology== Side view at the Philadelphia Zoo in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania Adult Nile crocodiles have a dark bronze colouration above, with faded blackish spots and stripes variably appearing across the back and a dingy off-yellow on the belly, although mud can often obscure the crocodile's actual colour. The flanks, which are yellowish-green in colour, have dark patches arranged in oblique stripes in highly variable patterns. Some variation occurs relative to environment; specimens from swift-flowing waters tend to be lighter in colour than those dwelling in murkier lakes or swamps, which provides camouflage that suits their environment, an example of clinal variation. Nile crocodiles have green eyes. The colouration also helps to camouflage it; juveniles are grey, multicoloured, or brown, with dark cross-bands on the tail and body. The underbelly of young crocodiles is yellowish green. As it matures, Nile crocodiles become darker and the cross-bands fade, especially those on the upper-body. A similar tendency in coloration change during maturation has been noted in most crocodile species. Most morphological attributes of Nile crocodiles are typical of crocodilians as a whole. Like all crocodilians, for example, the Nile crocodile is a quadruped with four short, splayed legs, a long, powerful tail, a scaly hide with rows of ossified scutes running down its back and tail, and powerful, elongated jaws.Grigg, G., & Kirshner, D. (2015). Biology and Evolution of Crocodylians. CSIRO PUBLISHING. Their skin has a number of poorly understood integumentary sense organs that may react to changes in water pressure, presumably allowing them to track prey movements in the water. The Nile crocodile has fewer osteoderms on the belly, which are much more conspicuous on some of the more modestly sized crocodilians. The species, however, also has small, oval osteoderms on the sides of the body, as well as the throat.Trutnau, L. & R. Sommerlad (2006). Crocodilians: Their Natural History and Captive Husbandry. Editiona Chimaira. Frankfurt am Main, Germany. The Nile crocodile shares with all crocodilians a nictitating membrane to protect the eyes and lachrymal glands to cleanse its eyes with tears. The nostrils, eyes, and ears are situated on the top of the head, so the rest of the body can remain concealed under water. They have a four- chambered heart, although modified for their ectothermic nature due to an elongated cardiac septum, physiologically similar to the heart of a bird, which is especially efficient at oxygenating their blood. As in all crocodilians, Nile crocodiles have exceptionally high levels of lactic acid in their blood, which allows them to sit motionless in water for up to 2 hours. Levels of lactic acid as high as they are in a crocodile would kill most vertebrates. However, exertion by crocodilians can lead to death due to increasing lactic acid to lethal levels, which in turn leads to failure of the animal's internal organs. This is rarely recorded in wild crocodiles, normally having been observed in cases where humans have mishandled crocodiles and put them through overly extended periods of physical struggling and stress. Nile crocodile's head ===Skull and head morphology=== Details of the skull from a juvenile Nile crocodile The mouths of Nile crocodiles are filled with 64 to 68 sharply pointed, cone-shaped teeth (about a dozen less than alligators have). For most of a crocodile's life, broken teeth can be replaced. On each side of the mouth, five teeth are in the front of the upper jaw (premaxilla), 13 or 14 are in the rest of the upper jaw (maxilla), and 14 or 15 are on either side of the lower jaw (mandible). The enlarged fourth lower tooth fits into the notch on the upper jaw and is visible when the jaws are closed, as is the case with all true crocodiles. Hatchlings quickly lose a hardened piece of skin on the top of their mouths called the egg tooth, which they use to break through their eggshells at hatching. Among crocodilians, the Nile crocodile possesses a relatively long snout, which is about 1.6 to 2.0 times as long as broad at the level of the front corners of the eyes. As is the saltwater crocodile, the Nile crocodile is considered a species with medium-width snout relative to other extant crocodilian species. In a search for the largest crocodilian skulls in museums, the largest verifiable Nile crocodile skulls found were several housed in Arba Minch, Ethiopia, sourced from nearby Lake Chamo, which apparently included several specimens with a skull length more than , with the largest one being in length with a mandibular length of . Nile crocodiles with skulls this size are likely to measure in the range of , which is also the length of the animals according to the museum where they were found. However, larger skulls may exist, as this study largely focused on crocodilians from Asia. The detached head of an exceptionally large Nile crocodile (killed in 1968 and measuring in length) was found to have weighed , including the large tendons used to shut the jaw. ====Biting force==== The bite force exerted by an adult Nile crocodile has been shown by Brady Barr to measure . However, the muscles responsible for opening the mouth are exceptionally weak, allowing a person to easily hold them shut, and even larger crocodiles can be brought under control by the use of duct tape to bind the jaws together.National Geographic documentary; \\"Bite Force\\", Brady Barr. The broadest snouted modern crocodilians are alligators and larger caimans. For example, a black caiman (Melanosuchus niger) was found to have a notably broader and heavier skull than that of a Nile crocodile measuring .Potts, Ryan J. Endangered Reptiles and Amphibians of the World – II. The Black Caiman, Melanosuchus niger, Vermont Herpetology. However, despite their robust skulls, alligators and caimans appear to be proportionately equal in biting force to true crocodiles, as the muscular tendons used to shut the jaws are similar in proportional size. Only the gharial (Gavialis gangeticus) (and perhaps some of the few very thin-snouted crocodilians) is likely to have noticeably diminished bite force compared to other living species due to its exceptionally narrow, fragile snout. More or less, the size of the tendons used to impart bite force increases with body size and the larger the crocodilian gets, the stronger its bite is likely to be. Therefore, a male saltwater crocodile, which had attained a length around , was found to have the most powerful biting force ever tested in a lab setting for any type of animal. ===Size=== Healthy subadult The Nile crocodile is the largest crocodilian in Africa, and is generally considered the second-largest crocodilian after the saltwater crocodile. Typical size has been reported to be as much as , but this is excessive for actual average size per most studies and represents the upper limit of sizes attained by the largest animals in a majority of populations.Brazaitis, P. (1989). The forensic identification of crocodilian hides and products. In: Crocodiles: Their Ecology, Management, and Conservation. IUCN Special Publication of Crocodile Specialist Groups of the Species Survival Commission. pp. 17–43. According to the Guinness Book of World Records, the typical mature size is between , while Alexander and Marais (2007) state it is and Garrick and Lang (1977) claim from . According to Cott (1961), the average length and weight of Nile crocodiles from Uganda and Zambia in breeding maturity was and . Per Graham (1968), the average length and weight of a large sample of adult crocodiles from Lake Turkana (formerly known as Lake Rudolf), Kenya was and body mass of .Graham, A. D. (1968). The Lake Rudolf Crocodile (Crocodylus niloticus Laurenti) Population. Masters of Science Thesis, The University of East Africa. Similarly, adult crocodiles from Kruger National Park reportedly average in length. In comparison, the saltwater crocodile and gharial reportedly both average around , so are about longer on average and the false gharial (Tomistoma schlegelii) may average about , so may be slightly longer, as well. However, compared to the narrow- snouted, streamlined gharial and false gharial, the Nile crocodile is rather more robust and ranks second to the saltwater crocodile in total average body mass among living crocodilians and third among all living reptiles - the massive leatherback turtle (Dermochelys coriacea) has a mean body mass slightly less than that of an average mature male saltwater crocodiles. The largest accurately measured male, shot near Mwanza, Tanzania, measured and weighed about . ====Size and sexual dimorphism==== Groupings of crocodiles like this can include crocodiles of various sizes, but seldom of less than , lest a cannibalistic large specimen launch an attack. Like all crocodiles, they are sexually dimorphic, with the males up to 30% larger than the females, though the difference is considerably less compared to some species, like the saltwater crocodile. Male Nile crocodiles are about longer on average at sexual maturity and grow more so than females after becoming sexually mature, especially expanding in bulk after exceeding in length.Leslie, A.J. (1997). The ecology and physiology of the Nile crocodile, Crocodylus niloticus, in Lake St Lucia, Kwazulu/Natal, South Africa. PhD thesis. Drexel University, PA, USA. Adult male Nile crocodiles usually range in length from long; at these lengths, an average sized male may weigh from . In Limpopo, South Africa, males reportedly average . Very old, mature ones can grow to or more in length (all specimens over from 1900 onward are cataloged later).Somma, Louis A. (June 19, 2002). Crocodylus niloticus Laurenti, 1768. USGS Nonindigenous Aquatic Species Database. Retrieved July 14, 2006 from the USGS Mature female Nile crocodiles typically measure , at which lengths the average female specimen would weigh . The bulk and mass of individual crocodiles can be fairly variable, some animals being relatively slender, while others being very robust; females are often bulkier than males of a similar length. As an example of the body mass increase undergone by mature crocodiles, one of the larger crocodiles handled firsthand by Cott (1961) was and weighed , while the largest specimen measured by Graham and Beard (1973) was and weighed more than .Graham, A., & Beard, P. (1973). Eyelids of Mornings. A. & W. Visual Library, Greenwich, CT, 113. In attempts to parse the mean male and female lengths across the species, the mean adult length was estimated to be reportedly in males, at which males would average about in weight, while that of the female is , at which females would average about .Richardson, K.C., G.J.W. Webb, and S.C. Manolis. (2002). Crocodiles Inside Out: A Guide to the Crocodilians and Their Functional Morphology. Surrey Beatty and Sons, Australia. This gives the Nile crocodile somewhat of a size advantage over the next largest non-marine predator on the African continent, the lion (Panthera leo), which averages in males and in females, and attains a maximum known weight of , far less than that of large male crocodiles. Evidence exists of Nile crocodiles from cooler climates, like the southern tip of Africa, being smaller, and may reach maximum lengths of only . A smaller population from Mali, the Sahara Desert, and elsewhere in West Africa reaches only in length,\\"Desert-Adapted Crocs Found in Africa\\", National Geographic News, June 18, 2002 but it is now largely recognized as a separate species, the West African crocodile. ==Distribution and habitat== The Nile crocodile is presently the most common crocodilian in Africa, and is distributed throughout much of the continent. Among crocodilians today, only the saltwater crocodile occurs over a broader geographic area,Thorbjarnarson, J. B., Messel, H., King, F. W., & Ross, J. P. (1992). Crocodiles: An action plan for their conservation. IUCN. although other species, especially the spectacled caiman (Caiman crocodilus) (due to its small size and extreme adaptability in habitat and flexibility in diet), seem to actually be more abundant. This species’ historic range, however, was even wider. They were found as far north as the Mediterranean coast in the Nile Delta and across the Red Sea in Israel and Syria. The Nile crocodile has historically been recorded in areas where they are now regionally extinct. For example, Herodotus recorded the species inhabiting Lake Moeris in Egypt. Additionally, the Nile crocodile is known from fossil remains to have once inhabited Lake Edward on the border between the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Uganda. They are thought to have become extinct in the Seychelles in the early 19th century (1810–1820). Today, Nile crocodiles are widely found in, among others, Somalia, Ethiopia, Uganda, Kenya, Egypt, the Central African Republic, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, , the Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Tanzania, Rwanda, Burundi, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Gabon, Angola, South Africa, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, Sudan, South Sudan, Botswana, and Cameroon. The Nile crocodile's current range of distribution extends from the regional tributaries of the Nile in Sudan and Lake Nasser in Egypt to the Cunene of Angola, the Okavango Delta of Botswana, and the Olifants River in South Africa. Isolated populations also exist in Madagascar, which likely colonized the island after the extinction of voay. In Madagascar, crocodiles occur in the western and southern parts from Sambirano to Tôlanaro. They have been spotted in Zanzibar and the Comoros in modern times, but occur very rarely. The species was previously thought to extend in range into the whole of West and Central Africa, but these populations are now typically recognized as a distinct species, the West African (or desert) crocodile. The distributional boundaries between these species were poorly understood, but following several studies, they are now better known. West African crocodiles are found throughout much of West and Central Africa, ranging east to South Sudan and Uganda where the species may come into contact with the Nile crocodile. Nile crocodiles are absent from most of West and Central Africa, but range into the latter region in eastern and southern Democratic Republic of Congo, and along the Central African coastal Atlantic region (as far north to Cameroon). Likely a level of habitat segregation occurs between the two species, but this remains to be confirmed. Nile crocodiles may be able to tolerate an extremely broad range of habitat types, including small brackish streams, fast-flowing rivers, swamps, dams, and tidal lakes and estuaries. In East Africa, they are found mostly in rivers, lakes, marshes, and dams, favoring open, broad bodies of water over smaller ones. In Madagascar, the remnant population of Nile crocodiles has adapted to living within caves. Although not a regular sea-going species as is the American crocodile, and especially the saltwater crocodile, the Nile crocodile possesses salt glands like all true crocodiles (but not alligators and caimans), and does on occasion enter coastal and even marine waters. They have been known to enter the sea in some areas, with one specimen having been recorded off St. Lucia Bay in 1917. ===Invasive species=== Nile crocodiles are an invasive species in North America, and several specimens have been recently captured in South Florida, though no signs that the population is reproducing in the wild have been found. Genetic studies of Nile crocodiles captured in the wild in Florida have revealed that the specimens are all closely related to each other, suggesting a single source of the introduction. This source remains unclear, as their genetics do not match samples collected from captives at various zoos and theme parks in Florida. When compared to Nile crocodiles from their native Africa, the Florida wild specimens are most closely related to South African Nile crocodiles. It is unknown how many Nile crocodiles are currently at large in Florida., Nile Crocodiles Found Near Miami, Researchers Confirm The animals likely were either brought there to be released, or are escapees. ==Behaviour== Adult Nile crocodile basking at Victoria Nile of Murchison Falls National Park, Uganda Generally, Nile crocodiles are relatively inert creatures, as are most crocodilians and other large, cold-blooded creatures. More than half of the crocodiles observed by Cott (1961), if not disturbed, spent the hours from 9:00 am to 4:00 pm continuously basking with their jaws open if conditions were sunny. If their jaws are bound together in the extreme midday heat, Nile crocodiles may easily die from overheating. Although they can remain practically motionless for hours on end, whether basking or sitting in shallows, Nile crocodiles are said to be constantly aware of their surroundings and aware of the presence of other animals. However, mouth-gaping (while essential to thermoregulation) may also serve as a threat display to other crocodiles, for example when specimens have been observed mouth-gaping at night when overheating is not a risk. In Lake Turkana, crocodiles rarely bask at all through the day, unlike crocodiles from most other areas, for unknown reasons, usually sitting motionless partially exposed at the surface in shallows with no apparent ill effect from the lack of basking on land. Crocodiles are deft and agile swimmers when motivated. In South Africa, Nile crocodiles are more easily observed in winter because of the extensive amount of time they spend basking at this time of year. More time is spent in water in overcast, rainy, or misty days. In the southern reaches of their range, as a response to dry, cool conditions that they cannot survive externally, crocodiles may dig and take refuge in tunnels and engage in aestivation. Pooley found in Royal Natal National Park that during aestivation, young crocodiles of total length would dig tunnels around in depth for most, some tunnels measuring more than , the longest there being . Crocodiles in aestivation are totally lethargic, entering a state similar to animals that hibernate. Only the largest individuals engaging in aestivation leave the burrow to sun on warmest days, otherwise these crocodiles rarely left their burrows. Aestivation has been recorded from May to August. Nile crocodiles usually dive for only a few minutes at a time, but can swim under water up to 30 minutes if threatened, and if they remain fully inactive, they can hold their breath for up to 2 hours (which, as aforementioned, is due to the high levels of lactic acid in their blood). They have a rich vocal range, and good hearing. Nile crocodiles normally crawl along on their bellies, but they can also \\"high walk\\" with their trunks raised above the ground. Smaller specimens can gallop, and even larger individuals are capable on occasion of surprising bursts of speed, briefly reaching up to . They can swim much faster by moving their bodies and tails in a sinuous fashion, and they can sustain this form of movement much longer than on land, with a maximum known swimming speed , more than three times faster than any human. Drawing depicting the mythical relationship between plovers and crocodiles – no reliable observations exist of this purported symbiosis Nile crocodiles have been widely known to have gastroliths in their stomachs, which are stones swallowed by animals for various purposes. Although this clearly is a deliberate behaviour for the species, the purpose is not definitively known. Gastroliths are not present in hatchlings, but increase quickly in presence within most crocodiles examined at and yet normally become extremely rare again in very large specimens, meaning that some animals may eventually expel them. However, large specimens can have a large number of gastroliths. One crocodile measuring and weighing had of stones inside it, perhaps a record gastrolith weight for a crocodile. Specimens shot near Mpondwe on the Semliki River had gastroliths in their stomach despite being shot miles away from any sources for stones, the same applies to the Kafue Flats, Upper Zambesi and Bangweulu Swamp, all of which often had stones inside them despite being nowhere near stony regions. Cott (1961) felt that gastroliths were most likely serving as ballast to provide stability and additional weight to sink in water, this bearing great probability over the theories that they assist in digestion and staving off hunger. However, Alderton (1998) stated that a study using radiology found that gastroliths were seen to internally aid the grinding of food during digestion for a small Nile crocodile. Herodotus claimed that Nile crocodiles have a symbiotic relationship with certain birds, such as the Egyptian plover (Pluvianus aegyptius), which enter the crocodile's mouth and pick leeches feeding on the crocodile's blood, but no evidence of this interaction actually occurring in any crocodile species has been found, and it is most likely mythical or allegorical fiction. However, Guggisberg (1972) had seen examples of birds picking scraps of meat from the teeth of basking crocodiles (without entering the mouth) and prey from soil very near basking crocodiles, so felt it was not impossible that a bold, hungry bird may occasionally nearly enter a crocodile's mouth, but not likely as a habitual behaviour. ==Hunting and diet== Attacking a Burchell's zebra in Kruger National Park, South Africa Nile crocodiles are apex predators throughout their range. In the water, this species is an agile and rapid hunter relying on both movement and pressure sensors to catch any prey unfortunate enough to present itself inside or near the waterfront. Out of water, however, the Nile crocodile can only rely on its limbs, as it gallops on solid ground, to chase prey. No matter where they attack prey, this and other crocodilians take practically all of their food by ambush, needing to grab their prey in a matter of seconds to succeed. They have an ectothermic metabolism, so can survive for long periods between meals—though when they do eat, they can eat up to half their body weight at a time. However, for such large animals, their stomachs are relatively small, not much larger than a basketball in an average-sized adult, so as a rule, they are anything but voracious eaters. Young crocodiles feed more actively than their elders according to studies in Uganda and Zambia. In general, at the smallest sizes (), Nile crocodiles were most likely to have full stomachs (17.4% full per Cott); adults at in length were most likely to have empty stomachs (20.2%). In the largest size range studied by Cott, , they were the second most likely to either have full stomachs (10%) or empty stomachs (20%). Other studies have also shown a large number of adult Nile crocodiles with empty stomachs. For example, in Lake Turkana, Kenya, 48.4% of crocodiles had empty stomachs. The stomachs of brooding females are always empty, meaning that they can survive several months without food. The Nile crocodile mostly hunts within the confines of waterways, either attacking aquatic prey or terrestrial animals when they come to the water to drink or to cross. The crocodile mainly hunts land animals by almost fully submerging its body under water. Occasionally, a crocodile quietly surfaces so that only its eyes (to check positioning) and nostrils are visible, and swims quietly and stealthily toward its mark. The attack is sudden and unpredictable. The crocodile lunges its body out of water in practically the blink of an eye and grasps its prey. On other occasions, more of its head and upper body is visible, especially when the terrestrial prey animal is on higher ground, to get a sense of the direction of the prey item as the top of an embankment or on a tree branch. Crocodile teeth are not used for tearing up flesh, but to sink deep into it and hold on to the prey item. The immense bite force, which may be as high as in large adults, ensures that the prey item cannot escape through the grip.Brady Barr, Dangerous Encounters. Retrieved on 2013-04-25. Much prey taken is much smaller than the crocodile itself and such prey can be overpowered and swallowed with ease. When it comes to larger prey, success depends on the crocodile's body power and weight to pull the prey item back into the water, where it is either drowned or killed by sudden thrashes of the head or by tearing it into pieces with the help of other crocodiles. Feeding on a dead wildebeest in the Masai Mara Subadult and smaller adult Nile crocodiles use their bodies and tails to herd groups of fish toward a bank, and eat them with quick sideways jerks of their heads. Some crocodiles of the species may habitually use their tails to sweep terrestrial prey off balance, sometimes forcing the prey specimen into the water, where it can be more easily drowned. They also cooperate, blocking migrating fish by forming a semicircle across the river. The most dominant crocodile eats first. Their ability to lie concealed with most of their bodies under water, combined with their speed over short distances, makes them effective opportunistic hunters of larger prey. They grab such prey in their powerful jaws, drag it into the water, and hold it underneath until it drowns. They also scavenge or steal kills from other predators, such as lions and leopards (Panthera pardus). Groups of Nile crocodiles may travel hundreds of meters from a waterway to feast on a carcass. They also feed on dead hippopotamuses (Hippopotamus amphibius) as a group (sometimes including three or four dozen crocodiles), tolerating each other. In fact, probably much of the food from crocodile stomachs may come from scavenging carrion, and the crocodiles could be viewed as performing a similar function at times as do vultures or hyenas on land. Once their prey is dead, they rip off and swallow chunks of flesh. When groups are sharing a kill, they use each other for leverage, biting down hard and then twisting their bodies to tear off large pieces of meat in a \\"death roll\\". They may also get the necessary leverage by lodging their prey under branches or stones, before rolling and ripping. The Nile crocodile possesses unique predation behavior characterized by the ability of preying both within its natural habitat and out of it, which often results in unpredicted attacks on almost any other animal up to twice its size. Most hunting on land is done at night by lying in ambush near forest trails or roadsides, up to 50 m (170 ft) from the water's edge. Since their speed and agility on land is rather outmatched by most terrestrial animals, they must use obscuring vegetation or terrain to have a chance of succeeding during land-based hunts. In one case, an adult crocodile charged from the water up a bank to kill a bushbuck (Tragelaphus scriptus) and instead of dragging it into the water, was observed to pull the kill further on land into the cover of the bush. Two subadult crocodiles were once seen carrying the carcass of a nyala (Tragelaphus angasii) across land in unison. In South Africa, a game warden far from water sources in a savannah-scrub area reported that he saw a crocodile jump up and grab a donkey by the neck and then drag the prey off. ===Invertebrates=== The type and size of the prey depends mostly on the size of the crocodile. The diet of young crocodiles is made up largely of insects and other invertebrates, since this is the only prey the same animals can easily take. More than 100 species and genera of insects were identified among the food of crocodiles of this age. Of the insects taken there, beetles made up 58% of the diet, including Hydrophilus and Cybister. giant water bugs but also crickets and dragonflies. Arachnids such as Dolomedes water spiders are taken, but always secondarily to insects in Uganda and Zambia. Crabs are also largely taken by crocodiles under , especially the genus Potamonautes, with different species being the primary crustacean food in different areas. Mollusks may occasionally be taken by young crocodiles (they are taken in larger numbers later in life in parts of Uganda and Zambia). In the Okavango Delta, Botswana, the diet was similar but young crocodiles ate a broader range of insects and invertebrates, with beetles taken in similar numbers to other, similar prey, both aquatic and terrestrial. In Botswana, arachnids were more often found in young crocodiles than in Uganda and Zambia. In Zimbabwe, the dietary composition was broadly similar to that in other areas. However, in the Ugandan portion of Lake Victoria, true bugs and dragonflies both seem to outnumber beetles notably and up to a length of crocodiles had stomach contents that were made up 70–75% of insects. After Nile crocodiles reach , the significance of most invertebrates in the diet decreases precipitously. An exception to this is in Uganda and Zambia, where subadults and adults of even large sizes, up to , may eat very large numbers of snails. Nearly 70% of the crocodiles examined by Cott (1961) had some remains of snails inside their stomachs. Predation on amuplariid water snails was especially heavy in Bangweulu Swamp, Lake Mweru Wantipa, and the Kafue Flats, where mollusks representing 89.1, 87, and 84.7% of all prey in these locations, respectively. Gastropoda (4126 records per Cott) were taken much more than Lamellibranchiata (six records). Notable favorites include Pila ovata, which lives just under water on rocky surfaces (mainly found in crocodiles from Uganda) and Lanistes ovum, which is found submerged among water plants and on detritus (mainly from stomachs in Zambia). ===Fish=== Subadult with tilapia as its prey During the time from when they are roughly long (roughly 5 to 9 years old), Nile crocodiles seem to have the broadest diet of any age range. They take more or less much the same small prey as smaller crocodiles, including insects and arachnids, but also take many small to medium-sized vertebrates and quickly become capable taking down prey up to their own weight. Fish become especially significant around this age and size. However, Cott (1961) found that the only size range where fish were numerically dominant over other types of food was from . This size range consists of subadult males and a mixture of subadult and adult females. In Lake Turkana, fish were the only food in the stomachs of 45.4% of the crocodiles that did not have empty stomachs, in total 87.8% of the crocodiles that did not have empty stomachs there had fish in their stomachs. Graham (1968) noted that throughout East Africa, crocodile diets are driven by the regional availability of prey. The arid land surrounding Lake Turkana is a relatively barren region for diverse or numerous prey other than fish, so fish are an exceptionally important food source to crocodiles there. In Lake Kyoga and Lake Kwana, 73.1% of the crocodiles that did not have empty stomachs had fish in their stomachs. At Lake St. Lucia in South Africa, many Nile crocodile congregate to feed on striped mullet (Mugil cephalus) as they make their seaward migration for spawning. Here, the crocodiles may line up in dozens across narrow straits of the estuary to effectively force the mullet into easy striking distance, with no observed in-fighting among these crocodile feeding congregations. At this time of plenty (before irrigation operations by humans led St. Lucia to have dangerously high saline levels), a crocodile could expect to eat of mullet daily, an exceptionally large daily amount for a crocodile. Larger fish, like catfish and freshwater bass, are preferred by adults more than in length. Particularly small fish are likely to be eaten only in case of sudden encounter, mostly in shallow, dry-season ponds where not much effort is needed to catch the small, agile prey. Most observed fishing by crocodiles takes place in waters less than deep and fish are often caught when they swim into contact with the crocodile's head, even literally right into the reptile's mouth. Across much of their range, they take any fish they encounter, but largish and relatively sluggish mesopredator fish such as lungfish and Barbus carp seem to be most widely reported. Many other genera are taken widely and relatively regularly, including Tilapia (which was the most significant prey genus in Lake Turkana), Clarias, Haplochromis, and Mormyrus. In Uganda and Zambia, lungfish comprised nearly two-thirds of the piscivorian diet for crocodiles. Similarly, in Lake Baringo, the lungfish is the crocodile's main prey and the crocodile is the lungfish's primary predator. In the Okavango Delta, the African pikes (Hepsetus spp.) were the leading prey group for subadults, comprising more than a fourth of the diet.Wallace, K. M. (2006). The feeding ecology of yearling, juvenile and sub- adult Nile crocodiles, Crocodylus niloticus, in the Okavango Delta, Botswana. Doctoral dissertation. University of Stellenbosch. Extremely large fish, such as Nile perch (Lates niloticus), goliath tigerfish (Hydrocynus goliath), and even sharks, are taken on occasion, in addition to big catfish, such as Bagrus spp. and Clarias gariepinus, which are preyed upon quite regularly in areas where they are common. In the Zambezi River and Lake St. Lucia, Nile crocodiles have been known to prey on bull sharks (Carcharhinus leucas) and sand tiger sharks (Carcharias taurus). The largest fishes attacked in such cases may potentially weigh more than .Pienaar, U. (1968). The Freshwater Fishes of the Kruger National Park. Republic of South Africa: The National Parks Board of Trustees of the Republic of South Africa.Skelton, P. (1993). A Complete Guide to the Freshwater Fishes of Southern Africa. Halfway House: Southern Book Publishers Ltd. When capturing large fish, they often drag the fish onto shore and swing their heads around to smash the fish onto the ground until it is dead or incapacitated. More modestly sized fish are generally swallowed whole. The Nile crocodile has a reputation as a voracious and destructive feeder on freshwater fish, many of which are essential to the livelihoods of local fisherman and the industry of sport fishing. However, this is very much an unearned reputation. As cold-blooded creatures, Nile crocodiles need to eat far less compared to an equivalent-weighted warm- blooded animal. The crocodile of consumes an average of fish per day. In comparison, piscivorous water birds from Africa eat far more per day despite being a fraction of the body size of a crocodile, for example a cormorant eats up to per day (about 70% of its own body weight), while a pelican consumes up to per day (about 35% of its own weight). The taking of commercially important fish, such as Tilapia, has been mentioned as a source of conflict between humans and crocodiles, and used as justification for crocodile-culling operations; however, even a primarily piscivorous crocodile needs relatively so little fish that it cannot deplete fish populations on its own without other (often anthropogenic) influences. Additionally, crocodiles readily take dead or dying fish given the opportunity, thus are likely to incidentally improve the health of some fish species’ populations as this lessens their exposure to diseases and infection. ===Reptiles and amphibians=== Captive adult Nile crocodiles feeding Frogs are regionally significant prey for small, young crocodiles in many regions, mainly those in the size range. The main amphibian prey species from Uganda and Zambia was the African common toad (Amietophrynus regularis) while in Botswana, the main amphibian prey was the reed frog (Hyperolius viridiflavus). Even the largest frog in the world, the goliath frog (Conraua goliath), has reportedly been preyed on by young Nile crocodiles.Thomson, G. (2006). Goliath Frog (Conraua goliath). B Freedman, ed. Encyclopedia of Endangered Species, Vol. 1. In general, reptiles become relatively common only in the diet in larger juvenile specimens and subadults. Large reptiles, or armoured reptiles such as turtles, were almost negligible in crocodiles under and most common in the stomachs of crocodiles over in length from Uganda and Zambia. Small species of reptiles are largely ignored as prey at this size. Freshwater turtles are often the most frequently recorded reptilian prey, unsurprisingly perhaps because most other reptiles other than a small handful of Lycodonomorphus water snakes are more terrestrial than water-based. In a study, the serrated hinged terrapin (Pelusios sinuatus) (also sometimes referred to as the \\"water tortoise\\") was more commonly reported in the stomach contents of adult crocodiles from Kruger National Park than any single mammal species. Other turtle species commonly recorded among Nile crocodile prey include the Speke's hinge-back tortoise (Kinixys spekii) and East African black mud turtle (Pelusios subniger). Beyond their ready availability and respectable size, turtles are favored by big crocodiles due to their slowness, which allows the cumbersome crocodiles to capture them more easily than swifter vertebrates. While adults have a sufficient bite force to crush turtle shells, younger crocodiles sometimes are overly ambitious, and will choke to death attempting to swallow whole large river turtles. A variety of snakes has been preyed on from relatively small, innocuous species such as the common egg-eating snake (Dasypeltis scabra) to the largest African snakes species, the African rock python (Python sebae), which can exceed in length and weigh over . Venomous species, including the puff adder (Bitis arietans), the forest cobra (Naja melanoleuca), and the black mamba (Dendroaspis polylepis) have been recorded as Nile crocodile prey. The only frequently recorded lizard prey is the large Nile monitor (Varanus niloticus), although this mesopredator may be eaten fairly regularly, as they often share similar habitat preferences, whenever a crocodile is able to ambush the stealthy monitor, which is more agile on land than the bulkier crocodile. ===Birds=== Pelicans have little to fear from crocodiles on land, but are quite vulnerable while swimming to crocodiles lurking under water. Numerous birds, including storks, small wading birds, waterfowl, eagles, and even small, swift-flying birds, may be snatched. As a whole, birds are quite secondary prey, rarely comprising more than 10–15% of crocodiles' diets, although are taken fairly evenly across all crocodile size ranges, excluding juveniles less than . Birds most often taken are African darters (Anhinga rufa) and reed (Microcarbo africanus) and white-breasted cormorants (Phalacrocorax lucidus), followed by various waterfowl, including most breeding geese and ducks in Africa. Slow-swimming pelicans are also frequently vulnerable to crocodiles. Nile crocodiles apparently frequently station themselves underneath breeding colonies of darters and cormorants and presumably snatch up fledgling birds as they drop to the water before they can competently escape the saurian, as has been recorded with several other crocodilians. Wading birds, even large and relatively slow-moving types such as the goliath heron (Ardea goliath), tend to be highly cautious in avoiding deep water in crocodile-occupied wetlands, whereas cormorants and waterfowl forage over deeper water and are easier for crocodiles to ambush, with Egyptian geese (Alopochen aegyptiaca) and spur-winged geese (Plectropterus gambensis) recorded as being taken largely while flightless due to molting their flight feathers.Todd, F.S. ed. (1996). Natural History of the Waterfowl. San Diego Natural History Museum, San Diego, California and Ibis Publishing Company. . On the contrary, several records exist of them capturing wading birds. Guggisberg (1972) saw multiple cases of predation on marabou storks (Leptoptilos crumenifer) and around Lake Turkana several may frequent heronries to pick off fledglings. In one case, a crocodile was filmed capturing a striated heron (Butorides striata) in mid-flight. Ospreys (Pandion haliaetus) are known to be grabbed while they dive for fishPoole, Alan F., Rob O. Bierregaard and Mark S. Martell. (2002). Osprey (Pandion haliaetus). The Birds of North America Online (A. Poole, Ed.). Ithaca: Cornell Lab of Ornithology. as are possibly African fish eagles (Haliaeetus vocifer), while crowned eagles (Stephanoaetus coronatus) have reportedly been ambushed on land at carrion. Crocodiles are occasionally successful in grabbing passerines such as weaver birds, including the abundant red-billed quelea (Quelea quelea), and swallows, having been observed to breach the water and in a matter of seconds sweep off a branch full of birds with remarkable success.Thiollay, J. M. (1989). Natural predation on quelea. Quelea quelea. Africa’s Bird Pest 216–229.Baker, S. W. (1891). Wild beasts and their ways: reminiscences of Europe, Asia, Africa and America. Macmillan and co. Larger land birds, such as bustards, guineafowl, ground hornbills (Bucorvus spp.) and ostriches (Struthio camelus), may be taken when they come to water to drink, but like most birds, are seldom harassed and a minor part of the diet. ===Mammals=== Considering the fact that crocodiles defecate in water, making scat analysis impossible, and that the examination of stomach contents is fairly difficult for which capturing of the animals individually is required for analysis, determining anything about the percentage of any specific food item in a crocodile's diet can be difficult. In addition, as an animal that feeds rarely, sometimes only a few times in a year, even the individual stomach content examinations sometimes prove to be unsuccessful. However, as crocodiles grow, relying solely on small and agile food items such as fish becomes difficult, this causes a shift in the diet as the animal matures, for energy conservation purposes, as in other predators. Nonetheless, starting around , they can become capable mammalian hunters and their ability to overpower a wide range of mammals increases along with their size. Crocodiles less than may take a variety of medium–sized mammals up to equal their own mass, including various monkeys, duikers, rodents, hares, pangolins, bats, dik-dik, suni (Neotragus moschatus),Schütze, H. (2002). Field Guide to the Mammals of the Kruger National Park. Struik. oribi (Ourebia ourebi) and other small ungulates up to the size of a Thomson's gazelle (Eudorcas thomsonii). Rodents and shrews may enter the diet of juvenile crocodiles, i.e. , and become commonplace in subadult and small adult crocodiles. Species recorded include the Natal multimammate mouse (Mastomys natalensis), African marsh rat (Dasymys incomtus), common rufous-nosed rat (Oenomys hypoxanthus), and savanna swamp shrew (Crocidura longipes). In many areas, the cane rats are a particular favorite mammalian food for crocodiles, particularly the relatively large greater cane rat (Thryonomys swinderianus). In Uganda and Zambia, the latter species are the leading overall mammalian prey type for crocodiles and one Kenyan crocodile of in length had 40 greater cane rats in its stomach.Fonck, H. (1910). Deutsch-Ost-Afrika: eine Schilderung deutscher Tropen nach 10 Wanderjahren. Vossische. Berlin. Cape porcupines (Hystrix africaeaustralis) are known to have been preyed on several times in Kruger National Park, their quills apparently being an insufficient defense against the tough jaws and digestive systems of crocodiles.Grenard, S. (1991). Handbook of alligators and crocodiles. Malabar, FL: Krieger. Small carnivores are readily taken opportunistically, including both African clawless otters (Aonyx capensis) and spotted-necked otters (Hydrictis maculicollis), as well as water mongoose (Atilax paludinosus), African wildcats (Felis silvestris lybica) and servals (Leptailurus serval). Adult Nile crocodiles, i.e. at least , are apex predators. While adults can and will consume nearly all types of prey consumed by the younger specimens, as adult crocodiles gain bulk, they lose much of the necessary maneuverability to capture agile prey such as fish and are not likely to meet their dietary needs by consuming small prey and may expel unnecessary amounts of energy, so take them secondarily to larger prey. Primates of various sizes may be taken by subadult or adult crocodiles. In some areas, some number of baboons is taken, such as in Okavango Delta, where chacma baboons (Papio ursinus) are eaten and Uganda, where olive baboons (Papio anubis) are taken. No records of them hunting apes (other than humans) have been made, but based on a strong reluctance to cross waters with crocodiles and a violent reaction to the visual stimuli of crocodiles, chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) and gorillas (Gorilla beringei) are thought to consider Nile crocodiles a serious threat. Few details are known about the dietary habits of Nile crocodiles living in Madagascar, although they are considered potential predators of several lemur species.Small, E. (2013). Steven M. Goodman', Sheila O'Connor, and Olivier Langrand Field Museum of Natural History. Lemur Social Systems and Their Ecological Basis, 51.Goodman, S. M., O’Connor, S., & Langrand, O.

Conservation Strategy for the West African Manatee. UNEP, Nairobi, Kenya andWetlands International Africa, Dakar, Senegal. Wildebeest crossing the Mara River, attacked by crocodiles Among the mammals, the bulk of the prey for adults is antelopes. In particular, the genus Kobus is often among the most vulnerable because it forages primarily in wetland areas and seeks to evade more prolific mammalian predators (such as hyenas, lions, etc.) by traveling along waterways. In some cases in Kruger National Park, antelope have been driven into water while being pursued by packs of African wild dogs (Lycaon pictus), which hunt by endurance, engaging prey in a grueling chase until it is exhausted (a very successful hunting style), only to be killed by opportunistic crocodiles. While not as extensively aquatic as the genus Kobus, the reedbucks and the impala (Aepyceros melampus) have both shown a partiality for grasslands adjoining wetlands and riparian zones, so are also very commonly recorded prey items. In Kruger National Park, over the course of 22 years of discontinuous observation, 60% of the large-game kills observed as perpetrated by crocodiles consisted of impala, while more than 15% of observed kills were made up of waterbuck (Kobus ellipsiprymnus), the largest of the genus Kobus at more than in weight. Elsewhere, the waterbuck appears to be the most significant mammalian prey for large adult crocodiles, such as in Uganda and Zambia (although due to more sporadic general ungulate populations in those countries, ungulates are less common as prey than in some other countries), as well as in Hluhluwe–iMfolozi Park, South Africa. Other antelopes recorded as prey including gazelles, bushbuck (Tragelaphus scriptus), sitatunga (Tragelaphus spekii), kudu (Tragelaphus strepsiceros), steenbok (Raphicerus campestris),Schaller, G. B.

In Maasai Mara, Tanzania, large crocodiles congregate at river crossings utilized by migrating herds of Burchell's zebras and blue wildebeests (Connochaetes taurinus), picking off hundreds of these large ungulates annually.Kennedy, A. S., & Kennedy, V. (2013). Animals of the Masai Mara. Princeton University Press. All domesticated ungulates and pet animals will on occasion be hunted by Nile crocodiles, up to the size of dromedary camels (Camelus dromedarius) and cattle (Bos taurus) In Tanzania, up to 54 head of cattle may be lost to crocodiles annually, increasing the human-crocodile conflict level. Goats (Capra aegagrus hircus), donkeys (Equus africanus asinus) and dogs (Canis lupus familiaris) may also rank among the most regularly recorded domesticated animals to be taken by Nile crocodiles. Particularly large adults, on occasion, take on even larger prey, such as giraffe (Giraffa camelopardalis), Cape buffalo (Syncerus caffer), and young African bush elephants (Loxodonta africana). Even heavier prey, such as black rhinoceros (Diceros bicornis), have been killed by crocodiles. In one case in the Tana River of Kenya, as observed by Max Fleishmann (communicated via letter to Theodore Roosevelt), a crocodile was able to bring down one of these huge herbivores by the help of muddy bank terrain, the adult female rhino's poor decision to enter deeper water rather than retreat to land and finally having been joined in drowning the animal by one to two other crocodiles.Selous, F. C. (1908). African nature notes and reminiscences. Galago. An additional case of predation on an adult black rhino was reportedly observed in northern Zambia. A bull giraffe that lost his footing on a river bank in Kruger National Park was seen to be killed by a large crocodile, while in another case there, a healthy bull buffalo was seen to be overpowered and killed by an average-sized adult male crocodile measuring after a massive struggle, an incident less commonly seen at this size. Since crocodiles are solitary hunters, the Nile crocodile is the only predator in Africa known to attack full-grown buffaloes alone, compared to the preferred pride attack method of lions.Notling, M. (2013) African Safari Journal and Field Guide. Global Travel Publishers, . Although crocodiles occasionally prey on hippopotamus calves, even large adult crocodiles rarely attack them because of the aggressive defense by mother hippos and the close protection of the herd, which pose a serious threat. Hippopotamus calves have been observed to at times act brazenly around crocodiles, foraging without apparent concern and even bumping into the reptiles. However, some large crocodiles have been recorded as predators of subadult hippos; anecdotally, the infamous giant crocodile Gustave was reported to have been seen killing adult female hippos.Quammen, D. (2004). Monster of God: the man-eating predator in the jungles of history and the mind. WW Norton & Company. A specimen from Zambia was found to have eaten a \\"half-grown hippo\\". At the no-longer-existent Ripon Falls in Uganda, one adult male hippopotamus was seen to be badly injured in a mating battle with a rival bull hippo, and was then subsequently attacked by several crocodiles, causing it to retreat to a reedbed. When the male hippo returned to the water, it was drowned and killed by the group of crocodiles amid \\"a truly terrifying commotion\\". However, other than rare instances, adults of megafauna species such as hippopotamuses, rhinoceroses, and elephants are not regular prey and are not typically attacked, with the exception of giraffes, since their anatomy makes them vulnerable to attack while taking a drink. Nile crocodiles on occasion prey on big cats including lions and leopards.Bailey, T. N. (1993). The African leopard: ecology and behavior of a solitary felid. Columbia University Press. However, in order to save energy, crocodiles do not prefer such agile animals, as most attacks will end before they can strike. Thus they usually attack agile prey in the absence of regular prey items. Other large carnivores that dwell in Africa near the top of the food chain can also on occasion fall prey to crocodiles. Such predators that can find themselves victim to crocodiles include hyenas (3 out of 4 species reported as prey for Nile crocodiles, only the desert-dwelling brown (Hyaena brunnea) being excluded),Brottman, M. (2013). Hyena. Reaktion Books. African wild dogs, jackals, and cheetahs (Acinonyx jubatus). ===Vegetation=== In the Nile crocodile as well as in at least 13 other species of crocodilian, a variety of fruit (mostly fleshy) has been found in stomach content. While these are probably sometimes used as gastroliths, they are likely often ingested for their nutritional value. Based on these findings, it has also been suggested that crocodiles may act as seed dispersers. ===Interspecific predatory relationships=== Living in the rich biosphere of Africa south of the Sahara, the Nile crocodile may come into contact with multiple other large predators. Its place in the ecosystems it inhabits is largely unique, as it is the only large tetrapod carnivore that spends the majority of its life in water and hunting prey associated with aquatic zones. Large mammalian predators in Africa are often social animals and obligated to feed almost exclusively on terrestrial zones. The Nile crocodile is a strong example of an apex predator. Outside water, crocodiles can meet competition from other dominant savannah predators, notably big cats, which in Africa are represented by lions, cheetahs, and leopards. In general, big cats and crocodiles have a relationship of mutual avoidance. Occasionally, if regular food becomes scarce, both lions and the crocodile will steal kills on land from each other and, depending on size, will be dominant over one another. Both species may be attracted to carrion, and may occasionally fight over both kills or carrion.Moleón, M., Sánchez‐Zapata, J. A., Sebastián‐González, E., & Owen‐Smith, N. (2015). Carcass size shapes the structure and functioning of an African scavenging assemblage. Oikos. Most conflicts over food occur near the water and can literally lead to a tug-of-war over a carcass that can end either way, although seldom is there any serious fighting or bloodshed between the large carnivores. Intimidation displays may also resolve these conflicts. However, when size differences are prominent, the predators may prey on each other. 2 cases of Leopards preying on Crocodiles were reported. ==Reproduction== A float of Nile crocodiles in Kilimanjaro Safaris at Disney's Animal Kingdom. On average, sexual maturity is obtained from 12 to 16 years of age. For males, the onset of sexual maturity occurs when they are about long and mass of , being fairly consistent.Loveridge, J. P., & Blake, D. K. (1972). Techniques in the immobilisation and handling of the Nile crocodile, Crocodylus niloticus. National Museums and Monuments of Rhodesia. On the other hand, that for females is rather more variable, and may be indicative of the health of a regional population based on size at sexual maturity. On average, according to Cott (1961), female sexual maturity occurs when they reach in length. Similarly, a wide range of studies from southern Africa found that the average length for females at the onset of sexual maturity was .Bourquin, S. L. (2008). The population ecology of the Nile Crocodile (Crocodylus niloticus) in the Panhandle Region of the Okavango Delta, Botswana. Doctoral dissertation. Stellenbosch University. However, stunted sexual maturity appears to occur in populations at opposite extremes, both where crocodiles are thought to be overpopulated and where they are overly reduced to heavy hunting, sometimes with females laying eggs when they measure as small as although it is questionable whether such clutches would bear healthy hatchlings. According to Bourquin (2008), the average breeding female in southern Africa is between . Earlier studies support that breeding is often inconsistent in females less than and clutch size is smaller, a female at reportedly never lays more than 35 eggs, while a female measuring can expect a clutch of up to 95 eggs. In \\"stunted\\" newly mature females from Lake Turkana measuring , the average clutch size was only 15. Graham and Beard (1968) hypothesized that, while females do continue to grow as do males throughout life, that past a certain age and size that females much over in length in Lake Turkana no longer breed (supported by the physiology of the females examined here); however, subsequent studies in Botswana and South Africa have found evidence of nesting females at least in length. In the Olifants River in South Africa, rainfall influenced the size of nesting females as only larger females (greater than ) nested during the driest years. Breeding females along the Olifants were overall larger than those in Zimbabwe. Most females nest only every two to three years while mature males may breed every year. During the mating season, males attract females by bellowing, slapping their snouts in the water, blowing water out of their noses, and making a variety of other noises. Among the larger males of a population, territorial clashes can lead to physical fighting between males especially if they are near the same size. Such clashes can be brutal affairs and can end in mortality but typically end with victor and loser still alive, the latter withdrawing into deep waters. Once a female has been attracted, the pair warble and rub the undersides of their jaws together. Compared to the tender behaviour of the female accepting the male, copulation is rather rough (even described as \\"rape\\"-like by Graham & Beard (1968)) in which the male often roars and pins the female underwater. Cott noted little detectable discrepancy in the mating habits of Nile crocodiles and American alligators. In some regions, males have reportedly mated with several females, perhaps any female that enters his claimed territory, though in most regions annual monogamy appears to be most common in this species. Eggs Females lay their eggs about one to two months after mating. The nesting season can fall in nearly every month of the year. In the northern extremes of the distribution (i.e. Somalia or Egypt), the nesting season is December through February while in the southern limits (i.e. South Africa or Tanzania) is in August through December. In crocodiles between these distributions egg-laying is in intermediate months, often focused between April and July. The dates correspond to about a month or two into the dry season within that given region. The benefits of this are presumably that nest flooding risk is considerably reduced at this time and the stage at which hatchlings begin their lives out of the egg falls roughly at the beginning of the rainy season, when water levels are still relatively low but insect prey is in recovery. Preferred nesting locations are sandy shores, dry stream beds, or riverbanks. The female digs a hole a few metres from the bank and up to 0.5 m (20 in) deep, and lays on average between 25 and 80 eggs. The number of eggs varies and depends partially on the size of the female. The most significant prerequisites to a nesting site are soil with the depth to permit the female to dig out the nest mound, shading to which mother can retire during the heat of the day and access to water. She finds a spot soft enough to allow her to dig a sideways slanted burrow. The mother Nile crocodile deposits the eggs in the terminal chamber and packs the sand or earth back over the nest pit. While, like all crocodilians, the Nile crocodile digs out a hole for a nest site, unlike most other modern crocodilians, female Nile crocodiles bury their eggs in sand or soil rather than incubate them in rotting vegetation. The female may micturate sporadically on the soil to keep it moist, which prevents soil from hardening excessively. After burying the eggs, the female then guards them for the three-month incubation period. Nests have been recorded seldom in concealed positions such as under a bush or in grasses, but normally in open spots on the bank. It is thought the Nile crocodile cannot nest under heavy forest cover as can two of the three other African crocodiles because they do not utilize rotting leaves (a very effective method of producing heat for the eggs) and thus require sunlight on sand or soil the surface of the egg chamber to provide the appropriate warmth for embryo development. In South Africa, the invasive plant Chromolaena odorata has recently exploded along banks traditionally used by crocodiles as nesting sites and caused nest failures by blocking sunlight over the nest chamber. When Nile crocodiles have been entirely free from disturbance in the past, they may nest gregariously with the nest lying so close together that after hatching time the rims of craters are almost contiguous. These communal nesting sites are not known to exist today, perhaps being most recently recorded at Ntoroko peninsula, Uganda where two such sites remaining until 1952. In one area, 17 craters were found in an area of , in another 24 in an area of . Communal nesting areas also reported from Lake Victoria (up until the 1930s) and also in the 20th century at Rahad River, Lake Turkana and Malawi.Adamson, J. (1956). Höhnel Island (South Island) in Lake Rudolf. Geographical Journal 478–482. The behaviour of the female Nile crocodile is considered unpredictable and may be driven by the regional extent of prior human disturbance and human persecution rather than natural variability. In some areas, the mother crocodiles will only leave the nest if she needs to cool off (thermoregulation) by taking a quick dip or seeking out a patch of shade. Females will not leave nest site even if rocks throw at her back and several authors note her trance-like state while standing near nest, similar to crocodiles in aestivation but not like any other stage in their life-cycle. In such a trance, some mother Nile crocodiles may show no discernable reaction even if pelted with stones. At other times, the female will fiercely attack anything approaching their eggs, sometimes joined by another crocodile which may be the sire of the young.Pooley, T. (1982). Discoveries of a Crocodile Man. 1st edition. William Collins Sons & Co. Ltd., Johannesburg. In other areas, the nesting female may disappear upon potential disturbance which may allow the presence of both the female and her buried nest to escape unwanted detection by predators. Despite the attentive care of both parents, the nests are often raided by humans and monitor lizards or other animals while she is temporarily absent.Trutnau, L. & Sommerland, R. (2006). Crocodilians: Their Natural History and Captive Husbandry. 1 edition. Brahm, A.S., Frankfurt. At a reported incubation period of about 90 days, the stage is notably shorter than that of the American alligator (110–120 days) but slightly longer than that of the mugger crocodile. Nile crocodiles have temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD), which means the sex of their hatchlings is determined not by genetics as is the case in mammals and birds, but by the average temperature during the middle third of their incubation period. If the temperature inside the nest is below 31.7 °C (89.1 °F), or above 34.5 °C (94.1 °F), the offspring will be female. Males can only be born if the temperature is within that narrow range. The hatchlings start to make a high-pitched chirping noise before hatching, which is the signal for the mother to rip open the nest. It is thought to be either difficult or impossible for hatchlings to escape the nest burrow without assistance, as the surface may become very heavy and packed above them. The mother crocodile may pick up the eggs in her mouth, and roll them between their tongue and the upper palate to help crack the shell and release her offspring. Once the eggs hatch, the female may lead the hatchlings to water, or even carry them there in her mouth, as female American alligators have been observed doing. A grouping of yearling baby Nile crocodiles. Hatchling Nile crocodiles are between long at first and weigh around . The hatchlings grow approximately that length each year for the first several years.Jablonicky, C. A. (2013). Spatial distribution of the Nile crocodile (Crocodylus niloticus) in the Mariarano River system, Northwestern Madagascar (Doctoral dissertation, University of Southern California). The new mother will protect her offspring for up to two years, and if there are multiple nests in the same area, the mothers may form a crèche. During this time, the mothers may pick up their offspring either in their mouths or gular fold (throat pouch), to keep the babies safe. The mother will sometimes carry her young on her back to avoid the natural predators of the small crocodiles, which can be surprisingly bold even with the mother around. Nile crocodiles of under two years are much more rarely observed than larger specimens, and more seldom seen than the same age young in several other types of crocodilian. Young crocodiles are rather shy and evasive due to the formidable gaunlet of predators that they must face in sub-Saharan Africa, spending little time sunning and moving about nocturnally whenever possible. The two-year-and-younger crocodiles may spend a surprising amount of time on land, as evidenced by the range of terrestrial insects found in their stomachs, and their lifestyle may resemble a semi-aquatic mid-sized lizard more so than the very aquatic lives of older crocodiles. At the end of the two years, the hatchlings will be about long, and will naturally depart the nest area, avoiding the territories of older and larger crocodiles. After this stage, crocodiles may loosely associate with similarly sized crocodiles and many assuredly enter feeding congregations of crocodiles once they attain , at which size predators and cannibal crocodiles become much less of a concern. Crocodile longevity is not well established, but larger species like the Nile crocodile live longer, and may have a potential average life span of 70 to 100 years, though no crocodilian species commonly exceeds a lifespan of 50 to 60 years in captivity. ===Natural mortality of young Nile crocodiles=== An estimated 10% of eggs will survive to hatch and a mere 1% of young that hatch will successfully reach adulthood. The full range of causes for mortality of young Nile crocodiles is not well understood, as very young and small Nile crocodiles or well-concealed nests are only sporadically observed. Unseasonable flooding (during nesting which corresponds with the regional dry season) is not uncommon and has probably destroyed several nests, although statistical likelihood of such an event is not known. The only aspect of mortality in this age range that is well studied is predation and this is most likely the primary cause of death while the saurians are still diminutive. The single most virulent predator of nests is almost certainly the Nile monitor. This predator can destroy about 50% of studied Nile crocodile eggs on its own, often being successful (as are other nest predators) in light of the trance- like state that the mother crocodile enters while brooding or taking advantage of moments where she is distracted or needs to leave the nest. In comparison, perenties (Varanus giganteus) (the Australian ecological equivalent of the Nile monitor) succeeds in depredating about 90% of freshwater crocodile (Crocodylus johnsoni) eggs and about 25% of saltwater crocodile nests. Mammalian predators can take nearly as heavy of a toll, especially large mongooses such the Egyptian mongoose (Herpestes ichneumon) in the north and the water mongoose in the south of crocodile's range. Opportunistic mammals who attack Nile crocodile nests have included wild pigs, medium-sized wild cats and baboon troops. Like Nile monitors, mammalian predators probably locate crocodile nests by scent as the padded-down mound is easy to miss visually. Marabou storks sometimes follow monitors to pirate crocodile eggs for themselves to consume, although can also dig out nests on their own with their massive, awl-like bills if they can visually discern the nest mound. Predators of Nile crocodiles eggs have ranged from insects such as the red flour beetle (Tribolium castaneum) to predators as large and formidable as spotted hyenas (Crocuta crocuta). Unsurprisingly, once exposed to the elements as hatchlings, the young, small Nile crocodiles are even more vulnerable. Most of the predators of eggs also opportunistically eat young crocodiles, including monitors and marabous, plus almost all co-existing raptorial birds, including vultures, eagles, and large owls and buzzards. Many \\"large waders\\" are virulent predators of crocodile hatchlings, from dainty little egrets (Egretta garzetta) and compact hamerkops (Scopus umbretta) to towering saddle- billed storks (Ephippiorhynchus senegalensis), goliath herons and shoebills (Balaeniceps rex). Larger corvids and some non-wading water birds (i.e. pelicans) can also take some young Nile crocodiles. Mammalian carnivores take many hatchlings as well as large turtles and snakes, large predatory freshwater fish, such as the African tigerfish, the introduced largemouth bass, and possibly bull sharks, when they enter river systems. When crocodile nests are dug out and the young placed in water by the mother, in areas such as Royal Natal National Park predators can essentially enter a feeding frenzy.Cott, H.B. (1971). Parental care in Crocodilia, with special reference to Crocodylus niloticus. Proc. 1st. work.Hancock, James A.; Kushlan, James Anthony and Kahl, M. Philip (1992) Storks, Ibises and Spoonbills of the World. Princeton University Press. . It may take a few years before predation is no longer a major cause of mortality for young crocodiles. African fish eagles can take crocodile hatchlings up to a few months of age and honey badgers can prey on yearlings. Once they reach their juvenile stage, very large African rock pythons and big cats remain as the only predatory threat to young crocodiles. Perhaps no predator is more deadly to young Nile crocodiles than larger crocodiles of their own species, as, like most crocodilians, they are cannibalistic. This species may be particularly dangerous to their own kind considering the aggressive disposition they tend to bear. While the mother crocodile will react aggressively toward potential predators and has been recorded chasing and occasionally catching and killing such interlopers into her range, due to the sheer number of animals who feed on baby crocodiles and the large number of hatchlings, she is more often unsuccessful at deflecting such predators. ==Environmental status== Conservation organizations have determined that the main threats to Nile crocodiles, in turn, are loss of habitat, pollution, hunting, and human activities such as accidental entanglement in fishing nets. Though the Nile crocodile has been hunted since ancient times, the advent of the readily available firearm made it much easier to kill these potentially dangerous reptiles. The species began to be hunted on a much larger scale from the 1940s to the 1960s, primarily for high-quality leather, although also for meat with its purported curative properties. The population was severely depleted, and the species faced extinction. National laws, and international trade regulations have resulted in a resurgence in many areas, and the species as a whole is no longer wholly threatened with extinction. The status of Nile crocodiles was variable based on the regional prosperity and extent of conserved wetlands by the 1970s.Cott, H. B., & Pooley, A. C. (1971). The status of crocodiles in Africa. Proceedings of the First Working group of the Crocodile Specialist Group, 2, 98. However, as is the case for many large animal species whether they are protected or not, persecution and poaching have continued apace and between the 1950s and 1980s, an estimated 3 million Nile crocodiles were slaughtered by humans for the leather trade. In Lake Sibaya, South Africa, it was determined that in the 21st century, persecution continues as the direct cause for the inability of Nile crocodiles to recover after the leather trade last century. Recovery for the species appears quite gradual and few areas have recovered to bear crocodile populations, i.e. largely insufficient to produce sustainable populations of young crocodiles, on par with times prior to the peak of leather trading. Crocodile 'protection programs' are artificial environments where crocodiles exist safely and without the threat of extermination from hunters. Large adults in captivity, Djerba, Tunisia Nile crocodiles in captivity, Israel An estimated 250,000 to 500,000 individuals occur in the wild today. The IUCN Red List assesses the Nile crocodile as \\"Least Concern (LR/lc)\\". The CITES lists the Nile crocodile under Appendix I (threatened with extinction) in most of its range; and under Appendix II (not threatened, but trade must be controlled) in the remainder, which either allows ranching or sets an annual quota of skins taken from the wild. The Nile crocodile is also widely distributed, with strong, documented populations in many countries in eastern and southern Africa, including Somalia, Ethiopia, Kenya, Zambia and Zimbabwe. This species is farmed for its meat and leather in some parts of Africa. Successful sustainable-yield programs focused on ranching crocodiles for their skins have been successfully implemented in this area, and even countries with quotas are moving toward ranching. In 1993, 80,000 Nile crocodile skins were produced, the majority from ranches in Zimbabwe and South Africa. Crocodile farming is one of the few burgeoning industries in Zimbabwe. Unlike American alligator flesh, Nile crocodile meat is generally considered unappetizing although edible as tribes such as the Turkana may opportunistically feed on them. According to Graham and Beard (1968), Nile crocodile meat has an \\"indescribable\\" and unpleasant taste, greasy texture and a \\"repellent\\" smell. The conservation situation is more grim in central and west Africa presumably for both the Nile and west African crocodiles. The crocodile population in this area is much more sparse, and has not been adequately surveyed. While the natural population in these areas may be lower due to a less-than-ideal environment and competition with sympatric slender- snouted and dwarf crocodiles, extirpation may be a serious threat in some of these areas. At some point in the 20th century, the Nile crocodile appeared to have been extirpated as a breeding species from Egypt, but has locally re- established in some areas such as the Aswan Dam. Additional factors are a loss of wetland habitats, which is addition to direct dredging, damming and irrigation by humans, has retracted in the east, south and north of the crocodile's range, possibly in correlation with global warming.Shacks, V. (2006). Habitat vulnerability for the Nile crocodile (Crocodylus niloticus) in the Okavango Delta, Botswana (Doctoral dissertation, Stellenbosch: University of Stellenbosch). Retraction of wetlands due both to direct habitat destruction by humans and environmental factor possibly related to global warming is perhaps linked to the extinction of Nile crocodiles in the last few centuries in Syria, Israel and Tunisia. In Lake St. Lucia, highly saline water has been pumped into the already brackish waters due to irrigation practices. Some deaths of crocodiles appeared to have been caused by these dangerous saline levels and this one-time stronghold for breeding crocodiles has experienced a major population decline. In yet another historic crocodile stronghold, the Olifants River, which flows through Kruger National Park, numerous crocodile deaths have been reported. These are officially due to unknown causes but analysis has indicated that environmental pollutants caused by humans, particularly the burgeoning coal industry, are the primary cause. Much of the contamination of crocodiles occurs when they consume rancid fish themselves killed by pollutants. Additional ecological surveys and establishing management programs are necessary to resolve these questions. The Nile crocodile is the top predator in its environment, and is responsible for checking the population of mesopredator species, such as the barbel catfish and lungfish, that could overeat fish populations on which other species, including birds, rely. One of the fish predators seriously affected by the unchecked mesopredator fish populations (due again to crocodile declines) is humans, particularly with respect to tilapia, an important commercial fish that has declined due to excessive predation. The Nile crocodile also consumes dead animals that would otherwise pollute the waters. ===Attacks on humans=== Makeshift barrier in Uganda to lessen the risk of crocodile attacks Much of the hunting of and general animosity toward Nile crocodiles stems from their reputation as a man-eater, which is not entirely unjustified. Despite most attacks going unreported, the Nile crocodile along with the saltwater crocodile is estimated to kill hundreds (possibly thousands) of people each year, which is more than all other crocodilian species combined.. While these species are much more aggressive toward people than other living crocodilians (as is statistically supported by estimated numbers of crocodile attacks), Nile crocodiles are not particularly more likely to behave aggressively to humans or regard humans as potential prey than saltwater crocodiles. However, unlike other \\"man-eating\\" crocodile species, including the saltwater crocodile, the Nile crocodile lives in close proximity to human populations through most of its range, so contact is more frequent. This combined with the species’ large size renders a higher risk of attack. Crocodiles as small as are capable of overpowering and successfully preying on small apes and hominids, presumably including children and smaller adult humans, but a majority of fatal attacks on humans are by crocodiles reportedly exceeding in length. In studies preceding the slaughter of crocodiles for the leather trade, when there were believed to be many more Nile crocodiles, a roughly estimated 1,000 human fatalities per annum by Nile crocodiles were posited with a roughly equal number of aborted attacks.Clarke, J. (1969). Man is the Prey. Stein and Day. A more contemporary study claimed the number of attacks by Nile crocodiles per year as 275 to 745, of which 63% are fatal, as opposed to an estimated 30 attacks per year by saltwater crocodiles, of which 50% are fatal. With the Nile crocodile and the saltwater crocodile, the mean size of crocodiles involved in non-fatal attacks was about as opposed to a reported range of or larger for crocodiles responsible for fatal attacks. The average estimated size of Nile crocodiles involved in fatal attacks is . Since a majority of fatal attacks are believed to be predatory in nature, the Nile crocodile can be considered the most prolific predator of humans among wild animals.Crocodilian attacks. 2008 IUCN SSC Crocodile Specialist Group In comparison, lions, in the years from 1990 to 2006, were responsible for an estimated one-eighth as many fatal attacks on humans in Africa as were Nile crocodiles. Although Nile crocodiles are more than a dozen times more numerous than lions in the wild, probably fewer than a quarter of living Nile crocodiles are old and large enough to pose a danger to humans.Frank, L., Hemson, G., Kushnir, H., & Packer, C. (2006, January). Lions, conflict and conservation in Eastern and Southern Africa. In The Eastern and Southern African Lion Conservation Workshop (pp. 11–13). Other wild animals responsible for more annual human mortalities either attack humans in self-defense, as do venomous snakes, or are deadly only as vectors of disease or infection, such as snails, ratsBenedictow, O. J. (2004). The Black Death, 1346–1353: the complete history. Boydell & Brewer. and mosquitos.Spielman, A., & d'Antonio, M. (2002). Mosquito: The story of man's deadliest foe. Hyperion. Regional reportage from numerous areas with large crocodile populations nearby indicate, per district or large village, that crocodiles often annually claim about a dozen or more lives per year. Miscellaneous examples of areas in the last few decades with a dozen or more fatal crocodile attacks annually include Korogwe District, Tanzania, Niassa Reserve, Mozambique and the area around Lower Zambezi National Park, Zambia. Despite historic claims that the victims of Nile crocodile attacks are usually \\"women and children\\", there is no detectable trends in this regard and any human, regardless of age, gender, or size is potentially vulnerable. Incautious human behavior is the primary drive behind crocodile attacks. Most fatal attacks occur when a person is standing a few feet away from water on a non-steep bank, are wading in shallow waters, actively swimming or have limbs dangling over a boat or pier. Many victims are caught while crouching and people in jobs that might require heavy usage of water including laundry workers, fisherman, game wardens and regional guides are more likely to be attacked. Many fisherman and other workers who are not poverty-stricken will go out of their way to avoid waterways known to harbor large crocodile populations. Most biologists who have engaged in months or even years of field work with Nile crocodiles, including Cott (1961), Graham and Beard (1968) and Guggisberg (1972), have found that with sufficient precautions, their own lives and the lives of their local guides were rarely, if ever, at risk in areas with many crocodiles. However, Guggisberg accumulated several earlier writings that noted the lack of fear of crocodiles among Africans, driven in part perhaps by poverty and superstition, that caused many observed cases of an \\"appalling\\" lack of caution within view of large crocodiles, as opposed to the presence of bold lions which engendered an appropriate panic. Per Guggisberg, this disregard (essentially regarding the crocodile as a lowly creature and thus non-threatening to humans) may account for the seemingly higher frequency of deadly attacks by crocodiles than by large mammalian carnivores. Most locals are well aware of how to behave in crocodile-occupied areas and some of the writings quoted by Guggisberg from the 19th and 20th century may require being taken with a \\"grain of salt\\". == See also == * Pansteatitis ==References* Multimedia information from National Geographic Kids site Nile crocodile Category:Apex predators Category:Reptiles of North Africa Category:Reptiles of Kenya Category:Nile Nile crocodile Category:Crocodilians of Africa Category:National symbols of Chad Category:National symbols of Djibouti Category:National symbols of Lesotho Category:National symbols of Niger Category:National symbols of Sierra Leone ","title":"Nile crocodile"},{"id":"1284980","text":"Toxic megacolon is an acute form of colonic distension. It is characterized by a very dilated colon (megacolon), accompanied by abdominal distension (bloating), and sometimes fever, abdominal pain, or shock. Toxic megacolon is usually a complication of inflammatory bowel disease, such as ulcerative colitis and, more rarely, Crohn's disease, and of some infections of the colon, including Clostridium difficile infections, which have led to pseudomembranous colitis. Other forms of megacolon exist and can be congenital (present since birth, such as Hirschsprung's disease). It can also be caused by Entamoeba histolytica and Shigella. It may also be caused by the use of loperamide. ==Signs and symptoms== *Abdominal pain *Abdominal bloating *Abdominal tenderness *Fever *Tachycardia (rapid heart rate) *Dehydration There may be signs of septic shock. A physical examination reveals abdominal tenderness and possible loss of bowel sounds. An abdominal radiography shows colonic dilation. White blood cell count is usually elevated. Severe sepsis may present with hypothermia or leukopenia. ==Pathophysiology== left A pathological specimen showing toxic megacolon The pathological process involves inflammation and damage to the colonic wall with unknown toxins breaking down the protective mucosal barrier and exposing the muscularis propria. There is relative destruction of the ganglion cells and swelling of the nerve fibers in the myenteric plexus, with concomitant damage to the colonic musculature. This results in almost complete paralysis of the diseased segment of the colon with loss of smooth muscle substance, tone and motility. This can lead to further complications as pressure builds up in the colon due to relative fecal stasis including sepsis, intestinal hemorrhage or free perforation and spontaneous decompression. ==Treatment== The objective of treatment is to decompress the bowel and to prevent swallowed air from further distending the bowel. If decompression is not achieved or the patient does not improve within 24 hours, a colectomy (surgical removal of all or part of the colon) is indicated. When surgery is required the recommended procedure is a subtotal colectomy with end ileostomy. Fluid and electrolyte replacement help to prevent dehydration and shock. Use of corticosteroids may be indicated to suppress the inflammatory reaction in the colon if megacolon has resulted from active inflammatory bowel disease. Antibiotics may be given to prevent sepsis. ==Prognosis== If the condition does not improve, the risk of death is significant. In case of poor response to conservative therapy, a colectomy is usually required. ==Complications== *Perforation of the colon *Sepsis *Shock Emergency action may be required if severe abdominal pain develops, particularly if it is accompanied by fever, rapid heart rate, tenderness when the abdomen is pressed, bloody diarrhea, frequent diarrhea, or painful bowel movements. Colonoscopy is contraindicated, as it may rupture the dilated colon resulting in peritonitis and septic shock. ==References== * ==Further reading== * * == External links == Category:Diseases of intestines Category:Large intestine ","title":"Toxic megacolon"},{"id":"1284983","text":"right Attenuation-to-crosstalk ratio (ACR) is a parameter that is measured when testing a communication link, which represents the overall performance of the cable. AcR is a mathematical formula that calculates the ratio of attenuation to near-end crosstalk for each combination of cable pairs. ACR is expressed as a figure in decibels (dB), between the signal attenuation produced by a wire or cable transmission medium and the near-end crosstalk (NEXT). In order for a signal to be received with an acceptable bit error rate, the attenuation and the crosstalk must both be minimized. Crosstalk can be reduced by ensuring that twisted-pair wiring is tightly twisted and is not crushed, and by ensuring that connectors between wire and cable media are properly rated and installed. Positive ACR calculations mean that transmitted signal strength is stronger than that of near-end crosstalk. ACR can be used to define a signal bandwidth (e.g. 250 MHz for category 6 cable) where signal to noise ratios are sufficient to support certain applications. The maximum frequency for which positive ACR is assured provides a benchmark to assess the usable bandwidth of twisted-pair cabling systems. EIA/TIA specifies specific values for ACR in order to meet the various categories of cable. ==See also== *Crosstalk (electronics) ==References== Category:Telecommunication theory ","title":"Attenuation-to-crosstalk ratio"},{"id":"1284992","text":"A boondoggle is a scheme that wastes time and money.

More than 22 million copies of her books are in print. ==Biography== Hoag was born in Cresco, Iowa and raised in the small town of Harmony, Minnesota, where her father sold insurance. From childhood, she knew she wanted to be a writer. \\"I had to spend a lot of time entertaining myself,\\" she told an interviewer in 2016. \\"I found books at a really young age and fell in love with books.\\" Hoag's first job after graduating from high school was in the La Crosse Tribune circulation department. Before publishing her first novel, she also worked as a photographer's assistant, trained show horses, and sold designer bathroom accessories. She married and divorced Daniel Hoag, whom she dated in high school. Hoag began her career as an author in 1988, writing category romances for the Bantam Books Loveswept Line. After several years of success in that field, Hoag switched her focus to single-title suspense novels. She has had thirteen consecutive New York Times bestsellers, including five in a 20-month span. Her novel Night Sins became a TV miniseries starring Valerie Bertinelli and Harry Hamlin. Hoag has been invited to do a reading at one of Barbara Bush's literacy functions. Hoag and three other authors who made the leap from romance to thrillers at roughly the same time (Eileen Dreyer, Elizabeth Grayson, and Kimberly Cates) have formed a group they call the Divas. The group provides support and encouragement for each other, and Hoag often thanks them in the acknowledgement section of her books. Hoag owns horses, and often goes for a ride to combat writer's block. She has competed in dressage at a national level, but stopped competing after breaking five vertebrae in her back during a fall while trying out a horse for a friend. Hoag is fully recovered from her accident, and has returned to the competition arena. She currently lives in Malibu, California, and Wellington, Florida. == Bibliography == ===Standalone novels=== * McKnight in Shining Armor (1988, Loveswept #276), (2009) Reissue * Mismatch (1989, Loveswept #315), (2008) Reissue * Sarah's Sin (1991, Loveswept #480) * Heart of Dixie (1991, Loveswept #493), (2008) Reissue * Taken by Storm (1992, Loveswept #532), (2007) Reissue * Still Waters (1992, Bantam Fanfare) * The Last White Knight (1992, Loveswept #561) * Dark Paradise (1994, Bantam Books) * Kill the Messenger (2004, Bantam Books) ===Oak Knoll series=== * Deeper than the Dead (2009) * Secrets to the Grave (2010) * Down the Darkest Road (2011) ===Elena Estes series=== * Dark Horse (2002) * The Alibi Man (2007) ===Kovac & Liska series=== * Ashes to Ashes (1999) * Dust to Dust (2000) * Prior Bad Acts (2006) also known as Dead Sky * The 1st Victim (2014, an e-book short story) * The 9th Girl (2013) * Cold Cold Heart (2015, Dutton) * The Bitter Season (2016) ===Deer Lake series=== * Night Sins (1995) * Guilty as Sin (1996) ===Doucet series=== * The Restless Heart (1991, Loveswept #458), (2007) Reissue * Lucky's Lady (1992) * Cry Wolf (1993) * A Thin Dark Line (1997) * The Boy (2018) * Bad Liar (2020) ===Hennessy series=== * The Trouble with J.J.

The website replaced Play.com, which was originally established in Jersey as an online retailer of entertainment products including DVDs and music, which subsequently expanded its product offering. Rakuten purchased Play.com in 2011, and in 2013 the company switched to its new marketplace format following a change in the law covering tax for companies operating in Jersey and selling to consumers on the UK mainland. The Play.com website was replaced by Rakuten.co.uk on 23 March 2015. ==History== ===Play.com=== Former Play.com logo following its purchase by Rakuten Play.com was founded in 1998 under the name Play247.com, but rebranded as Play.com in 2000. Play.com originally sold region 1 and 2 DVDs only, but since expanded its range to include CDs and video games and other electronic items. In 2004 it began to sell books and electronics, in 2006 it started selling personal computers, posters and T-shirts and in 2007 it started selling HD DVDs and Blu-rays, with sister site PlayUSA.com selling region 1 DVDs, HD DVDs and region A Blu-ray Discs and offering sales in a range of currencies. The site's interface was redesigned on a number of occasions. Play.com was ranked second on the November 2006 UK \\"Hot Shops List\\" compiled by IMRG and Hitwise.\\"November Hitwise - IMRG Hot Shops List\\" - hitwise.com; retrieved 12 May 2007 In 2008, Play.com started selling DRM-free MP3s, clothing, accessories, and tickets for events, allowing customers to buy and sell tickets. They also held a consumer games show which was open to the public, with tickets available through Play.com. This event was backed by Sony, Microsoft, Ubisoft, Activision, and THQ among others. On 15 January 2009, a survey published by Verdict Research found Play.com was the UK's second favourite music and video retailer, behind first place Amazon.co.uk and ahead of the now defunct entertainment retailer Zavvi which was third. On 24 February 2009, it was reported that Play.com had topped the National Consumer Satisfaction Index, ahead of Amazon.co.uk and iTunes. In May 2009, Play.com launched a branded Visa credit card in partnership with MBNA. Cardholders received points for purchases made on the website and at other retailers. Points could then be redeemed against products bought on the Play.com website. The PlayUSA.com website was closed down in February 2011. In September 2011, Japan-based Rakuten purchased Play.com for £25 million. Since March 2013, Play.com has operated solely as an online marketplace, where third party retailers sell products with their listings hosted on the website.

Ashley is a Jamaican- American. Born in Jamaica, she moved to the United States at a young age. She is the younger sister of chess grandmaster Maurice Ashley and former world kickboxing champion Devon Ashley. ==Career== Ashley began her professional boxing career on January 29, 1999, defeating Lisa Howarth by a six-round split decision, at Atlantic City, New Jersey. On her second professional boxing fight, held at Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada, she suffered her first defeat, when she was outpointed over six rounds by Doris Hackl on June 20 of that year. Ashley rebounded from that defeat with an eight-round decision win over Bonnie Canino June 27 at Tunica, Mississippi. After her first three fights, she took a seven-month hiatus from boxing, but on February 11, 2000, she returned, losing by an eight-round decision to Mexico's Laura Serrano, also in Tunica. After splitting her two next fights, she met \\"Downtown Leona Brown\\": on June 29, she beat Brown on points over eight rounds at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Next, she fought Kelsey Jeffries, who, until that bout had lost only one of her nine fights. On September 3, Ashley beat Jeffries by a six- round unanimous decision in Nevada. Ashley had only one fight in 2001, a decision victory, and then, on January 13, 2002, she made her Las Vegas debut, drawing (tying) in six rounds with Layla McCarter. Her next fight, fought on February 23 of that year, was also her first world title try, when she and Jeffries were rematched with the vacant IWBF world Featherweight title on the line. Ashley became a world champion by defeating Jeffries, this time by a ten-round split decision, at New Jersey. Ashley lost her next fight, when she met the experienced Chevelle Hallback, for Hallback's WIBA world Junior Lightweight title, by a ten-round unanimous decision, in Georgia on August 27. Ashley then went down in weight, returning to the Super Bantamweight division. On November 15, she defeated Marcela Acuña by a ten-round split decision in Córdoba, Argentina, to win the WIBF's vacant world Super Bantamweight title. But this decision win was controversial (the fight was scored 96-94 by two judges for Ashley, and 97-95 by the third for Acuña), and the WIBF ordered an immediate rematch between the two women fighters. On June 14, 2003, she and Acuña met again, this time at Buenos Aires. The second time around, Ashley retained the title with a ten-round unanimous decision. On November 15, she lost her title to Esther Schouten by a ten-round split decision in Austria. Her next was against Shondell Alfred, on March 27, 2004, in Guyana. She defeated Alfred by an eight-round decision. After a hiatus that lasted almost one year, Ashley returned to boxing on March 3, 2005. when she knocked out Elena Reid in seven rounds, at Laughlin. She also fought in the World Combat League. She lost the fight against Argentina's Marcela Eliana Acuna for the WBC female world super bantamweight title by a majority decision at the Estadio Luna Park in Buenos Aires on August 20, 2009. After winning two fights in New York City, Ashley won the vacant WBC female super bantamweight title via a unanimous decision at the Hunts Point Produce Market in the Bronx on July 23, 2011. on 2016 Oct 01 in dort federal event center in Flint Michigan Alicia Ashley loss her title to Fatuma zarika by split decision As of July 2011, Ashley has never lost a fight by knockout. == Professional boxing record == -  style=\\"text-align:center;\\" colspan=\\"8\\"24 Wins (4 knockouts), 12 Losses, 1 Drawn - style=\\"text-align:center; background:#e3e3e3;\\"  style=\\"border-style:none none solid solid; \\"Res.  style=\\"border-style:none none solid solid; \\"Record  style=\\"border-style:none none solid solid; \\"Opponent  style=\\"border-style:none none solid solid; \\"Type  style=\\"border-style:none none solid solid; \\"Round Time  style=\\"border-style:none none solid solid; \\"Date  style=\\"border- style:none none solid solid; \\"Location  style=\\"border-style:none none solid solid; \\"Notes - align=center Loss24-12-1align=left Dina Thorslund    align=left align=left - align=center Win24-11-1align=left Liliana Martinez    align=left align=left - align=center Loss23-11-1align=left Fatuma Zarika    align=left align=left - align=center Win23-10-1align=left Christina McMahon    align=left align=left - align=center Win22-10-1align=left Grecia Nova    align=left align=left - align=center Loss21-10-1align=left Jackie Nava    align=left align=left - align=center Win21-9-1align=left Nohime Dennisson    align=left align=left - align=center Win20-9-1align=left Zenny Sotomayor    align=left align=left - align=center Win19-9-1align=left Chantal Martínez    align=left align=left - align=center Win18-9-1align=left Maria Elena Villalobos    align=left align=left - align=center Win17-9-1align=left Christina Ruiz    align=left align=left - align=center Win16-9-1align=left Crystal Hoy    align=left align=left - align=center Win15-9-1align=left Jackie Trivilino    align=left align=left - align=center Loss14-9-1align=left Marcela Eliana Acuña    align=left align=left - align=center Loss14-8-1align=left Lisa Brown    align=left align=left - align=center Win14-7-1align=left Brooke Dierdorff    align=left align=left - align=center Win13-7-1align=left Delia Hoppe    align=left align=left - align=center Loss12-7-1align=left Xiyan Zhang    align=left align=left - align=center Loss12-6-1align=left Myung Ok Ryu    align=left align=left - align=center Win12-5-1align=left Alesia Graf    align=left align=left - align=center Win11-5-1align=left Elena Reid    align=left align=left - align=center Win10-5-1align=left Shondell Alfred    align=left align=left - align=center Loss9-5-1align=left Esther Schouten    align=left align=left - align=center Win9-4-1align=left Marcela Eliana Acuña    align=left align=left - align=center Win8-4-1align=left Marcela Eliana Acuña    align=left align=left - align=center Loss7-4-1align=left Chevelle Hallback    align=left align=left - align=center Win7-3-1align=left Kelsey Jeffries    align=left align=left - align=center Draw6-3-1align=left Layla McCarter    align=left align=left - align=center Win6-3align=left Claudette Alexander    align=left align=left - align=center Win5-3align=left Kelsey Jeffries    align=left align=left - align=center Win4-3align=left Leona Brown    align=left align=left - align=center Loss3-3align=left Songul Oruc    align=left align=left - align=center Win3-2align=left Heather McVey    align=left align=left - align=center Loss2-2align=left Laura Serrano    align=left align=left - align=center Win2-1align=left Bonnie Canino    align=left align=left - align=center Loss1-1align=left Doris Hackl    align=left align=left - align=center Win1-0align=left Lisa Howarth    align=left align=left - align=center ==See also== * List of female boxers ==References== ==External links== * Alicia Ashley at Awakening Fighters * Category:1967 births Category:Living people Category:American women boxers Category:Jamaican women boxers Category:Jamaican emigrants to the United States Category:Super-bantamweight boxers ","title":"Alicia Ashley"},{"id":"1285064","text":"The Family Justice Council, established in 2004, is an advisory, non- statutory, non-departmental public body sponsored by the Judicial Office of England and Wales.

She was the daughter of Odo, Count of Orléans, and his wife, Engeltrude de Fézensac. The epithet \\"of Orléans\\" is not contemporary. == Historiography on queenship == The traditional historiography on queenship has created an image of a queen who was the \\"helpmate\\" of a king. According to J.Nelson, a queen was unable to ‘rule in her own right’ and was often relegated to the private sphere of the Carolingian world, meaning she was heavily involved in the household and family. More recent historiography has examined how queens were integral to the survival of the dynasty through a maternal role. Z.Mistry has thoroughly examined Ermentrude of Orleans' role in the Carolingian dynasty by looking at the expectation of her to provide an heir for Charles the Bald. However it is clear that their role has been evaluated by historians as one of domesticity and child bearing. P.Stafford has examined queenship in a lot of depth. She summarises how vital a queen’s role was in the continuation of a dynasty, by analysing how ‘a wife’s survival depended on the production of sons’ and her primary function was to provide heirs.. Stafford also described the queen’s involvement of the running of the household and being a hostess of kind. She was in charge of gift giving to high officials in a society where this was very important to maintain loyalties and bonds. The queen was also in charge of ‘the maintenance of the royal dignity’. Queens were expected to act as a chaste, loyal and wise woman, being allocated the role of ensuring that the royal family were not involved in any form of scandal. Finally, they were involved in small day-to-day running of the household, as they were in charge of the king’s treasury, expected to ensure a smoothly-ran household, and to direct the education of the children. They had power within the household and partially within court. == Ermentrude's consecration == Ermentrude’s consecration was written in 866 by the Archbishop Hincmar of Rheims during a politically turbulent time regarding his relationship with Charles the Bald. It is the coronation of a wife rather than a bride, as she was crowned over 20 years after her wedding to Charles the Bald, as later referenced. Z. Mistry has released an in depth analysis on the ordination of Ermentrude. According to Mistry, the ordination shows two important ideas about Queen Ermentrude and queenship in general: a) dynastic security b) how to be a good wife to a king. Throughout the ordination, Ermentrude is repeatedly compared to Sarah from the Bible, and Mistry concludes that this is an attempt from Hincmar and Charles the Bald to bless the Carolingian dynasty with heirs through Ermentrude. This is because Sarah struggled to have children until she reaffirmed her faith, showing that royal fertility and dynastic survival was entwined with devout faith. Mistry points out that Hincmar also developed an ideology for the behaviour of queens in his ordination and other works. Mistry analyses how Ermentrude was expected to be ‘loveable like Rachel, wise like Rebecca, loyal like Sarah.’ This list for how to be a good queen was common in Carolingian times, as John Eriugena praised Ermentrude for her chastity, piety, and constant prayer, all virtues reminiscent of biblical women. == Additional information == Ermentrude had a gift for embroidery and an interest in religious foundations. She was described by a contemporary, John Scottus Eriugena, as a 'strong woman' (femina fortis). Two letters written in her name survive, and a further five that were addressed to her. She had associations with several convents, including Chelles and Avenay, and was involved in twelve charters issued by King Charles the Bald. In August 866, Ermentrude was consecrated, over twenty years after becoming queen. It has been suggested that this reflected her husband's desire for more children.Jane Hyam, 'Ermentrude and Richildis', in Charles the Bald, Court and Kingdom, ed.

Pan-Iranism is an ideology that advocates solidarity and reunification of Iranian peoples living in the Iranian plateau and other regions that have significant Iranian cultural influence, including the Persians, Azeris, Lurs, Gilaks, Mazanderanis, Kurds, Zazas, Talysh, Tajiks of Tajikistan and Afghanistan, Pashtuns, Ossetians, Baloch of Pakistan, etc. The first theoretician was Dr Mahmoud Afshar Yazdi.Professor Richard Frye states:The Turkish speakers of Azerbaijan are mainly descended from the earlier Iranian speakers, several pockets of whom still exist in the region (Frye, Richard Nelson, “Peoples of Iran”, in Encyclopedia Iranica).Swietochowski, Tadeusz. “Azerbaijan, Republic of”,., Vol. 3, Colliers Encyclopedia CD-ROM, 02-28-1996: “The original Persian population became fused with the Turks, and gradually the Persian language was supplanted by a Turkic dialect that evolved into the distinct Azerbaijani language.”Golden, P.B. “An Introduction to the History of the Turkic Peoples”, Otto Harrosowitz, 1992. “The Azeris of today are an overwhelmingly sedentary, detribalized people.

Also accessible here:. Excerpt: \\"Afšār, a political scientist, pioneered systematic scholarly treatment of various aspects of Iranian national identity, territorial integrity, and national unity. An influential nationalist, he also displayed a strong belief in the nationalist character of Iranian people throughout the country’s long history. He was the first to propose the idea of Pan-Iranism to safeguard the unity and territorial integrity of the nation against the onslaught of Pan-Turkism and Pan-Arabism (Afšār, p. 187)\\" He also displayed a strong belief in the nationalist character of Iranian people throughout the country’s long history. Unlike similar movements of the time in other countries, Pan-Iranism was ethnically and linguistically inclusive and solely concerned with territorial nationalism, rather than ethnic or racial nationalism.Perspectives on Iranian identity, pg.26 On the eve of World War I, pan-Turkists focused on the Turkic-speaking lands of Iran, Caucasus and Central Asia.Touraj Atabaki, “Recasting Oneself, Rejecting the Other: Pan- Turkism and Iranian Nationalism” in Van Schendel, Willem(Editor). Identity Politics in Central Asia and the Muslim World: Nationalism, Ethnicity and Labour in the Twentieth Century. London, GBR: I. B. Tauris & Company, Limited, 2001. Actual Quote: The ultimate purpose was to persuade these populations to secede from the larger political entities to which they belonged and join the new pan-Turkic homeland. It was the latter appeal to Iranian Azerbaijanis, which, contrary to Pan-Turkist intentions, caused a small group of Azerbaijani intellectuals to become the strongest advocates of the territorial integrity of Iran. After the constitutional revolution in Iran, a romantic nationalism was adopted by Azerbaijani Democrats as a reaction to the pan-Turkist irredentist policies threatening Iran’s territorial integrity. It was during this period that Iranism and linguistic homogenization policies were proposed as a defensive nature against all others. Contrary to what one might expect, foremost among innovating this defensive nationalism were Iranian Azerbaijanis. They viewed that assuring the territorial integrity of the country was the first step in building a society based on law and a modern state. Through this framework, their political loyalty outweighed their ethnic and regional affiliations. The adoption of these integrationist policies paved the way for the emergence of the titular ethnic group’s cultural nationalism. ==History== Pan-Iranist flags seen during Pro-Mosaddegh rallies in Tehran on 16 August 1953 With the collapse of the Qajar dynasty, which had descended into corruption, and the rise of Reza Shah Pahlavi in 1925, who began introducing secular reforms limiting the power of the Shia clergy, Iranian nationalist and socialist thinkers had hoped that this new era would also witness the introduction of democratic reforms. However, such reforms did not take place. This culminated in the gradual rise of a loosely organized grass roots Pan-Iranist movement made up of nationalist writers, teachers, students, and activists allied with other pro-democracy movements. In the 1940s, following the Anglo-Soviet invasion of Iran, the Pan-Iranist movement gained momentum and popularity as a result of the widespread feeling of insecurity among Iranians who saw the king, Reza Shah, powerless against such foreign presence in the country. There were soldiers from Russia, England, India, New Zealand, Australia and later on, America, present in the country, especially in the capital, Tehran. The Allied occupation influenced a series of student movements in 1941. One of these new groups was an underground nationalist guerrilla group called the Revenge group, also known as the Anjoman. The Pan- Iranist Party was founded later on by two of the members of the Revenge group and two other students in the mid-to-late 1940s in Tehran University. Though the pan-Iranist movement had been active throughout the 1930s, it had been a loosely organized grass roots alliance of nationalist writers, teachers, students, and activists. The party was the first organization to officially adopt the pan-Iranist position, which believed in the solidarity and reunification of the Iranian peoples inhabiting the Iranian plateau. In 1951, the party leaders Mohsen Pezeshkpour and Dariush Forouhar came to a disagreement as to how the party should operate, and a division occurred. The two factions greatly differed in their organizational structure and practice. The Pezeskpour faction, which retained the party name, believed in working within the system of Mohammad Reza Pahlavi. The Forouhar faction, which adopted a new name, Mellat Iran (Nation of Iran Party), believed in working against the system. ==Iran-e-Bozorg== Iran-e Bozorg was a periodical published in the city of Rasht by the Armenian political activist Gregory Yeghikian (). It advocated the unification of Iranian peoples (e.g., Afghans, Kurds, etc.) included the Armenians. Yaqikiān believed that, with education and the rising of the levels of people’s awareness, such a goal was feasible through peaceful means. The journal benefited from the contributions of a number of leading intellectuals of the time, including Moḥammad Moʿin and ʿAli Esfandiāri (Nimā Yušij), and carried articles, poetry, a serialized story, and some news. It also published articles in support of the Kurds who had risen in rebellion in Turkey, which caused the protest of the Turkish counsel in Rasht and led to the banning of the paper by the order of the minister of court. Yaqikiān tried, without success, to have the ban removed and eventually moved to Tehran, where he published the paper Irān-e Konuni. ==See also== *Greater Iran *Iranian peoples *Iranian languages *Persian Empire *History of Azerbaijan *History of Iran *History of Afghanistan *History of Tajikistan *History of Pakistan *History of Turkey *History of Uzbekistan *History of the Kurds ==Further reading== *Hezbe Pan Iranist by Ali Kabar Razmjoo () *Engheta, Naser (2001). 50 years history with the Pan-Iranists.

He is best known for developing a series of photosonic disk () instruments in the 1980s that produced sound from modulated light (a light source shines through painted glass discs; the resulting patterns of light are picked up by photo cells and converted into a voltage which can then be treated as a sound signal). right The production of synthetic sound in this manner has been used in \\"optosonic\\" instruments since the early 20th century (for example the Optophonic Piano). However Dudon's method is notable for the generation of tone which is produced by the overlapping of two or three discs, and the opportunities this design provides for timbral shifts by slowing one or more discs manually, thereby altering the waveform. In the 1970s, he created 150 water instruments called \\"aquaphones\\" (described in his pioneering book ), including a \\"flutabullum\\", a system of transforming flute sounds by recording them underwater). ==Aquavina== The aquavina was an experimental musical instrument created by Jacques Dudon.Hopkin, Bart (1996).

W. Post, a former patient and later competitor of the 19th-century breakfast food innovator Dr. John Harvey Kellogg. The cereal originally prepared by C. W. Post when developing the product was a batter that came from the oven as a rigid sheet. He then broke the sheet into pieces and ran them through a coffee grinder to produce the \\"nut\\"-sized kernels. ==Marketing== Grape-Nuts ad, 1900Grape-Nuts was initially marketed as a natural cereal that could enhance health and vitality, and as a \\"food for brain and nerve centres.\\" Its lightweight and compact nature, nutritional value, and resistance to spoilage made it a popular food for exploration and expedition groups in the 1920s and 1930s. In World War II, Grape-Nuts was a component of the lightweight jungle ration used by some U.S. and Allied Forces in wartime operations before 1944.Kearny, Cresson H. (Major), Jungle Snafus...And Remedies, Oregon Institute (1996), pp. 290–291 A 1939 ad campaign by cartoonist Walter Hoban continued his Jerry on the Job comic strip in Woman's Day magazine and daily newspaper comics pages. General Foods also marketed Grape-Nuts through a comics-style advertising campaign (a trailblazer in this regard) featuring a character named Little Alby, who gained inordinate strength after consuming a bowl of Grape- Nuts.\\"Funny Business: The Rise and Fall of Johnstone and Cushing,\\" Hogan's Alley, 1999 During the 1940s, comic books from various companies featured one- page comic-strip ads starring Volto from Mars, a finned red helmet-clad alien superhero visiting Earth, who like all Martians, recharged his magnetic powers (his left hand repels, his right attracts) by eating \\"cereal grains\\", with him quickly developing a particular fondness for Grape-Nuts Flakes which he proclaimed \\"the best I ever tasted!\\"Zeno, Eddy, Al Plastino: Last Superman Standing, TwoMorrows Publishing (2016), pp. 31 In the 1960s, advertising promoted Grape-Nuts as the cereal that \\"fills you up, not out\\". Brand users, particularly mother/daughter look-alikes, were shown engaged in fitness activities such as tennis, horseback riding, skiing, and swimming. Also appearing during the \\"fills you up, not out\\" campaign were Rob Steffens and Peter Steffens as the characters from The Peter and Bobert Show, as well as Andy Griffith and Don Knotts as Sheriff Andy Taylor and Deputy Barney Fife. This ad campaign produced one television commercial, which aired on television in 1968, that featured a catchphrase that became a target for numerous sketches and satirical mentions in media. Spanning the ensuing two decades and beyond, \\"Oh no, Mrs. Burke! I thought you were Dale!\\" was parodied on television variety show sketches, in the film The Kentucky Fried Movie, and in many episodes of Mystery Science Theater 3000. Fans continue to discuss the origin of this \\"riff\\" and have even developed products that feature the text, \\"I thought you were Dale.\\" A subsequent ad campaign generated another catchphrase, as Euell Gibbons became the spokesperson for the brand, promoting Grape-Nuts as the \\"Back to Nature Cereal\\". The line \\"Ever eat a pine tree? Many parts are edible\\" drew attention to the product from consumers, as well as from comedians. Grape-Nuts is credited as the first widespread product to use a coupon in sales promotion when C.W. Post Company offered a penny-off coupon to get people to try their cereal in the late 1890s. Until recent years, Grape-Nuts packaging set it apart from other cereals, in that no sealed film bag was used. It was sold in the usual \\"tombstone\\" cardboard box; rather than featuring lightly glued flaps at the top which could be separated to open the top face completely, perforations could be broken to form a small opening for pouring, near the intersection of one of the narrow side faces and the top surface. At one time, Grape-Nuts was the seventh-most popular cold breakfast cereal, but sales declined as Post was sold from one company to another. Around 2005, it held less than 1% of the market. About this time, the formula was changed; the husks from milled grain were ground into the flour and the cereal was pitched as \\"whole grain\\", albeit at the cost of roughening the cereal's texture and detracting significantly from mouthfeel. The addition of vitamins and minerals allowed it to qualify for food-stamp programs. ==Ingredients== Modern-day Grape-Nuts contain whole grain wheat flour, malted barley flour, salt, dried yeast and the following added vitamins and minerals: iron, vitamin B3, zinc oxide, vitamin B6, vitamin B1, and folic acid. ==Ice cream== Grape-Nut ice cream Grape-Nut ice cream is a popular regional dish in the Canadian Maritimes, the Shenandoah Valley, Jamaica, and New England. One origin story is that it was created by chef Hannah Young at The Palms restaurant in Wolfville, Nova Scotia, in 1919. She created it when she ran out of fresh fruit to add to ice cream, and decided to throw in some cereal. It proved popular at the restaurant and the Scotsburn Dairy company began mass- producing the ice cream variety, and it sold across the region.\\"Ice cream company scoops grapenut ice cream from Hannah Young\\". Hantsport News and Views. July 2010, pg. 12 Variations of ice cream with Grape Nuts are also called brown bread ice cream.

He worked as muwaqqit (موقت, religious timekeeper) in the Umayyad Mosque in Damascus and constructed a sundial for its minaret in 1371/72. ==Astronomy== Ibn al-Shatir most important astronomical treatise was kitab nihayat al-sul fi tashih al-usul (\\"The Final Quest Concerning the Rectification of Principles\\"). In it he drastically reformed the Ptolemaic models of the Sun, Moon and planets. His model incorporated the Urdi lemma, and eliminated the need for an equant by introducing an extra epicycle (the Tusi-couple), departing from the Ptolemaic system in a way that was mathematically identical (but conceptually very different) to what Nicolaus Copernicus did in the 16th century. Unlike previous astronomers before him, Ibn al-Shatir was not concerned with adhering to the theoretical principles of natural philosophy or Aristotelian cosmology, but rather to produce a model that was more consistent with empirical observations. For example, it was Ibn al-Shatir's concern for observational accuracy which led him to eliminate the epicycle in the Ptolemaic solar model and all the eccentrics, epicycles and equant in the Ptolemaic lunar model. His model was thus in better agreement with empirical observations than any previous model, and was also the first that permitted empirical testing.Y. M. Faruqi (2006). \\"Contributions of Islamic scholars to the scientific enterprise\\", International Education Journal 7 (4): 395-396. His work thus marked a turning point in astronomy, which may be considered a \\"Scientific Revolution before the Renaissance\\". Ibn al-Shatir's model for the appearances of Mercury, showing the multiplication of epicycles in a Ptolemaic enterprise Drawing on the observation that the distance to the Moon did not change as drastically as required by Ptolemy's lunar model, Ibn al-Shatir produced a new lunar model that replaced Ptolemy's crank mechanism with a double epicycle model that reduced the computed range of distances of the Moon from the Earth.Neugebauer (1975), volume 3 at pages 1108-1109. This was the first accurate lunar model which matched physical observations. ===Possible influence on Nicolaus Copernicus=== Although Ibn al- Shatir's system was firmly geocentric (he had eliminated the Ptolemaic eccentrics), the mathematical details of his system were identical to those in Copernicus's De revolutionibus.The model Copernicus used in his earlier Commentariolus differs in minor detail from that of ibn al-Shatir. V. Roberts and E. S. Kennedy, \\"The Planetary Theory of Ibn al-Shatir\\", Isis, 50(1959):232-234. jstor Furthermore, the exact replacement of the equant by two epicycles used by Copernicus in the Commentariolus paralleled the work of Ibn al-Shatir one century earlier. Ibn al-Shatir's lunar and Mercury models are also identical to those of Copernicus. (PDF version) This has led some scholars to argue that Copernicus must have had access to some yet to be identified work on the ideas of ibn al-Shatir.Linton (2004, pp.124,137–38), Saliba (2009, pp.160–65). It is unknown whether Copernicus read ibn al-Shatir and the argument is still debated. ==Instruments== The idea of using hours of equal time length throughout the year was the innovation of Ibn al-Shatir in 1371, based on earlier developments in trigonometry by al-Battānī. Ibn al- Shatir was aware that \\"using a gnomon that is parallel to the Earth's axis will produce sundials whose hour lines indicate equal hours on any day of the year.\\" His sundial is the oldest polar-axis sundial still in existence. The concept later appeared in Western sundials from at least 1446. Ibn al-Shatir also invented a timekeeping device called \\"ṣandūq al‐yawāqīt\\" (jewel box), which incorporates both a universal sundial and a magnetic compass. He invented it for the purpose of finding the times of prayers. Other notable instruments invented by him include a reversed astrolabe and an astrolabic clock. ==See also== *List of Arab scientists and scholars *Islamic scholars ==Notes== ==References== * Fernini, Ilias.
