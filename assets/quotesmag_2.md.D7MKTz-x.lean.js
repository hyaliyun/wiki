It contains a single species, Almas ukhaa, named in 2017 by Pei Rui and colleagues, based on a partial articulated skeleton. The only known specimen was found in the Djadochta Formation, which is late Campanian in age. ==Discovery and naming== In 1993, a joint expedition by the American Museum of Natural History and the Mongolian Academy of Sciences discovered near Ukhaa Tolgod, the Flaming Cliffs, a skeleton of a small theropod. It was prepared by Amy Davidson. Though in subsequent years its traits were inserted in some data matrices of phylogenetic analyses, a description of the fossil was never published. In 2017, the type species Almas ukhaa was named and described by Pei Rui, Mark Norell, Daniel Barta, Gabriel Bever, Michael Pittman and Xu Xing. The generic name refers to the almas, \\"wild man\\" in Mongolian, a man- like creature from Mongolian folklore. The specific name refers to its provenance. The holotype, IGM 100/1323, was found in a layer of the Djadochta Formation dating from the late Campanian. It consists of a partial skeleton with skull. The skull, better preserved, was found disarticulated from the postcrania, but was considered to have belonged to the same individual. Parts of the skull roof, as well as the lower jaws, were found disconnected from the remainder of the head. The postcranial skeleton contains three sacral vertebrae, eleven front tail vertebrae, belly ribs, parts of the pelvis and parts of the hindlimbs, which lack the toes. It represents a subadult individual. Near the skeleton egg shells have been found of the Prismatoolithidae type.

During the Holocaust he was a member of the ≈Åado≈õ Group also called as ≈Åado≈õ Group, an informal cooperation of Jewish organizations and Polish diplomats who fabricated and smuggled illegal Latin American passports to occupied Poland, saving their holders and their families from immediate deportation to German Nazi death camps. ==Early life and political career== Silberschein was born in Lw√≥w as the son of Jakub Silberschein, a dentist and his wife Anna n√©e Polturak. He did his university studies in Lw√≥w and Vienna, obtaining a PhD in law and in philosophy. After coming back, he opened a law practice in Lw√≥w at Trybunalska Street (today Shevs'ka, ukr. –®–µ–≤—Å—å–∫–∞). During the Interwar period, he was active in Zionist organizations, and part of the board of the short-lived Hitachdut Zionist Labor Party (Mifleget haAvoda haTzionit ‚ÄûHitachdut\\", 1925‚Äì1938). Dr. Silberschein left for Geneva on August 9, 1939, three weeks before the German invasion of Poland.http://search.archives.jdc.org/multimedia/Documents/NY_AR2132/00034/NY_AR2132_03204.pdf ==≈Åado≈õ Group and Holocaust rescue action== During the Holocaust, Silberschein took an active part in the attempt to save Jews by organizing passports of Latin American countries. He did so under the \\"RELICO\\" Assistance Committee established in Geneva and in full co-operation with the World Jewish Congress. Initially, these activities had an incidental character, but in 1942‚Äì43 began to be carried out on a massive scale. Silberschein remained in close contact with Polish diplomats Juliusz K√ºhl, Stefan Ryniewicz and Konstanty Rokicki. He raised funds to bribe corrupted Latin American honorary consuls and had the lists of beneficiaries smuggled from and into the ghettoes of the German- occupied Poland. He also collaborated with Peruvian Consul Jos√© Mar√≠a Barreto, later recognized as Righteous Among the Nations, and probably also ‚Äì independently ‚Äì with consuls of Honduras and Haiti. In the autumn of 1943, he was briefly arrested by the Swiss police. He then testified that he had acted on behalf of Ryniewicz and Rokicki, from whom he had learned about the passport mechanism itself and who had asked him to coordinate the activities. This way, passports could be bought in bulk, which reduced their price. Silberschein said: \\"A few months ago, I had a meeting in Bern, at the Polish Legation, with Mr Ryniewicz, first secretary of the Legation, and with Mr Rokicki, who heads the consular section in Berne. They drew my attention to the fact that certain persons in Switzerland had taken on the task of providing passports from South American countries to Poles who found themselves in various countries under German occupation. Those passports enabled those concerned to obtain an improvement in their lot. It was a case of a real \\"black market\\" in passports, and those gentlemen of the Legation made known to me their desire that I should take charge of the matter; I accepted the proposal in the name of RELICO. That way, those concerned could avoid having to pay enormous sums of money. I can state that 80% of the passports were paid for by the Universal Committee of Jewry. I reached an agreement with Mr Rockicki of the consular section of the Polish legation in Bern, who took on the task, which he still has, of handing passports from Paraguay over to me\\".Abraham Silberschein's interrogation, 9/1/1943, Federal Archives in Bern The bearers of the passports were interned by the Germans as citizens of neutral countries, and not deported to the death camps as most of the Polish Jewish population. \\"I must say that the difference in treatment was enormous, and that one could even say that often, in that way, the person concerned escaped death\\", he testified. According to the Swiss police reports Rokicki hand-filled the Paraguayan passports and delivered the bribes to H√ºgli sometimes helped by his Jewish subordinate, attach√© Juliusz K√ºhl.Julius K√ºhl's interrogation, 5/22/1944, Federal Archives in Bern The head of the Legation, Aleksander ≈Åado≈õ and his deputy Stefan Ryniewicz would secure the diplomatic coverage of the action and intervened with the police.Heinrich Rothmund's note one meeting with Stefan Ryniewicz, 9/6/1943, Federal Archives in Bern., the MFA of Switzerland.Marcel Pilet-Golaz's note on exchange with Aleksander Lados, 10/13/1943, Federal Archives in Bern and the Legation of the US1. Silberschein stated he had acted 'only for a charitable end' and 'in full cooperation with the Polish diplomatic authorities in Switzerland'. .Abraham Silberschein's letter to the Papal Nuncio Filippo Bernardini 8/27/1943, Federal Archives in Bern Silberschein also testified to have obtained a number of passports from the consulates of Peru, Honduras and Haiti. After the arrest of Silberschein, counsel Stefan Ryniewicz successfully intervened in his defense with police chief Heinrich Rothmund. ==Legacy and later life== It is estimated that the actions of the ≈Åado≈õ Group have saved the lives of hundreds of peopleThank you lettef from World Agudas Israel Organization, January 1945, https://twitter.com/luccasj/status/897110584482779136 ‚Äì mostly Polish and Dutch Jews who survived as holders of Paraguay's passports after Paraguay ‚Äì pressured by Poland and the Holy See recognized the validity of the latter. In the case of Silberschein, this number should also include some of the survivors thanks to other passports, mostly Honduran ones. The role of the Legation of Poland in producing and obtaining the latter is unclear. After the war Silberschein remained in Geneva, where he married Fanny Schulthess-Hirsch, the Director of the International Committee for the Placement of Intellectual Refugees. He died in December 30, 1951 in Geneva and is buried in the local Jewish cemetery. ==See also== * Chaim Yisroel Eiss ==References== Category:1882 births Category:1951 deaths Category:≈Åado≈õ Group members Category:Lawyers from Lviv Category:People from the Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria Category:Austro-Hungarian Jews Category:Jews from Galicia (Eastern Europe) Category:Jewish Polish politicians Category:Zionists Category:Members of the Sejm of the Second Polish Republic (1922‚Äì1927) Category:Polish exiles Category:People who rescued Jews during the Holocaust Category:Recipients of the Virtus et Fraternitas Medal Category:20th-century lawyers ","title":"Abraham Silberschein"},{"id":"56057874","text":"Although elements of fashion design copyright may be traced in Europe to as early as the 15th century, as of 2016 most countries (including the United States and the United Kingdom) fashion design does not have the same protection as other creative works (art, film, literature, etc.), because apparel (clothes, shoes, handbags, etc.) are classified as \\"functional items\\", excluded from protection by copyright laws.

By 1711, in Lyon, illegalities were already being defined in regards to fashion materials, and in 1787, in England and Scotland fashion designers had fruitfully pushed their needs for protection into basic legislation. In 1876 Germany began protecting fashion patterns as well as models, and in 2002 European regulation on designs that were new and provided an aspect of fresh character or aesthetic were brought under protection.(Fischer Par. 8) From 2004 to 2006 the ‚Äútotal production volume for clothing decreased by about 5% each year‚Ä¶ [and by] 2006 the European union trade deficit for clothing was at 33.7 billion.‚Äù(Fischer Par. 2) These statistics show that while there are benefits of their advanced design legislation, the economic and external factors still hindered their industry growth in ways the U.S. can empathize with.

Intellectual property laws protect \\"trade dress\\", which is an appearance of a product which uniquely identifies its source to the level of a trademark. Some countries introduced other laws to protect fashion design; however, the protection is inconsistent around the world. ===European Union=== In the European Union, the Creative Designs Directive and the European Designs Directive are in effect to protect new designs for three or five years. ===United States=== As of late 2015, fashion designs were not subject to copyright laws in the United States, and could not be copyrighted.\\"Protection for Fashion Design\\", Statement of the United States Copyright Office before the Subcommittee on Courts, the Internet, and Intellectual Property, Committee on the Judiciary, United States House of Representatives, 109th Congress, 2nd Session, July 27, 2006.\\"Fashion Design and Copyright in the US and EU\\", Michele Woods and Miyuki Monroig, Copyright Law Division, World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO), Geneva, November 17, 2015.

She also refers to Tom Ford pointing out that the people who buy cheap lookalikes are a different demographic compared with people who buy the original very high-end products and that while many exclusive designers get copied, also the high end designers often attribute the inspiration of their creations to following street fashion, so the copying is a two-way street.Johanna Blakley: Lessons from fashion's free culture TED Talk, 2010 == References == Category:Fashion design Category:Copyright law ","title":"Fashion design copyright"},{"id":"56057882","text":"Enyel De Los Santos Polanco (born December 25, 1995) is a Dominican professional baseball pitcher in the Philadelphia Phillies organization.

It is native to the eastern Pacific Ocean. It was first described in 1895 by the zoologist S.J. Holmes from Bodega Bay, California. Of the 32 or so species in the genus Hippolyte, it is most closely related to H. obliquimanus and H. williamsi. ==Description== Three species of shrimp in the genus Hippolyte are known from the eastern Pacific Ocean. The California green shrimp is a very slender, green glass-like shrimp up to about in length, with females generally being larger than males. The carapace is extended forwards as a long rostrum. ==Distribution== The California green shrimp is known from the western coast of North America where it ranges in shallow water from Bodega Bay to the Gulf of California, but is uncommon southwards from Elkhorn Slough. It inhabits calm waters, hiding by day under rocks and in cracks. ==Ecology== The California green shrimp is a specialist feeder on the eel grass Zostera marina. It has been shown that it recognises clumps of eel grass visually, preferentially moving towards dark model clumps contrasting with their pale backgrounds. A pattern of vertical stripes in the model is more attractive than a plain-coloured, rectangular object, and a model with narrow stripes is more attractive than one with wide stripes. This shrimp congregates in large numbers at night around eel grass clumps, swimming in and out among the individual blades. This species engages in rafting, being conveyed across the surface of the sea, carried along on buoyant objects such as floating clumps of seaweed, and this aids in the shrimp's dispersal to new locations. ==References== Category:Hippolytidae Category:Crustaceans described in 1895 ","title":"Hippolyte californiensis"},{"id":"56058034","text":"The 1919 Cork Intermediate Hurling Championship was the 11th staging of the Cork Intermediate Hurling Championship since its establishment by the Cork County Board.

In 1901 Klodt, now under the strong influence of impressionism, started to work as stage designer, for the leading theatres of St Petersburg and Moscow. With Korovin he created the stage design for the ballet The Little Humpbacked Horse by Cesare Pugni at the Bolshoi Theatre, in 1901.

He is the first golfer with cerebral palsy to participate in a PGA Tour sanctioned event. == Early life and golf development == Kyle was born a month early and suffered a stroke during birth, causing his cerebral palsy. From an early age, Miller's left hand was rigidly curled and walking required him to limp on his toes. At the age of 9, Miller and his mother approached the Shriners Hospital for Children to operate on Miller's hand, hoping to straighten it by transferring muscle from the bottom of his wrist to the top. He was very aware that this surgery could mean not waking up, and has stated: \\"The decision was ultimately mine, and it was with a deep breath I signed the waiver with my good hand.\\" By the time Kyle began playing golf, he had accumulated 14 surgeries, including one to straighten his left leg. Miller began playing golf while in elementary school. During high school, he would skip classes to go to the driving range. Miller learned much of his ability by shadowing local golfer and coach Marty Desmarais at a local golf club in Calgary. Miller studied business during university, but dropped out and moved to Florida despite having limited funds in order to pursue his dreams of becoming a professional golfer. While in Florida, Kyle met fellow Canadian golf instructor Sean Foley. Miller has attributed much of his success to Foley, stating \\"What Sean has given me is hope and belief\\", \\"Here's someone who has become one of the top teachers in the world, and he's telling me I could make it. So why would I doubt myself?\\" == Professional career == Miller turned professional in 2013 after finishing second in his Play Ability test. Subsequently, he went on to be featured in the Calgary Herald and Golf Digest in October 2013. In 2017, Miller was given a spot in the Mackenzie Tour. In doing so, Miller became the first golfer with Cerebral Palsy to achieve such a feat. Miller believes that much of his success so far has been due to his disadvantage, and the lack of belief in his ability by his peers. Miller states, \\"I've been able to teach and inspire countless people with disabilities that achieving your dream is possible, regardless of what people tell you.\\" == Technique == The left half of Miller's body is numb, which means that he cannot feel his weight transfer forward during his downswing. His mobility range through his left hand and left leg are limited. In regards to his approach, Miller has stated \\"I've been forced to understand what the body could do, how the body got better and how I'm going to be good. So I think it's an advantage, not a disadvantage\\". == Coaching == Alongside earning his professional status and competing in various Professional Golf Tour's, Miller has coached at golf's highest level, and has given thousands of lessons in an effort to inspire others to overcome their own obstacles through golf. Miller has stated \\"Some guys need to learn how to get knocked down and get back up again, and enjoy it\\", \\"There's an art to that. There's a genuine art to thoroughly loving failure. I love it. It's the greatest thing that happened to me. And that's what I want to offer to players.\\" Miller is a current member of the Canadian Golf Teachers Federation and the World Golf Teachers Federation. == Charitable efforts == Kyle is the spokesman for The Cerebral Palsy Association of Alberta and remains a passionate advocate to those with cerebral palsy and other disabilities.

He received a B.A. from Franklin and Marshall College in 1998, and a Ph.D. from the Johns Hopkins University in 2005 for a dissertation 'Experiments on the effect of secular variation in seawater Mg/Ca (calcite and aragonite seas) on calcareous biomineralization'. He received postdoctoral training at the Johns Hopkins University, the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, and the California Institute of Technology. Ries was a professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill for five years before becoming a professor at Northeastern University in 2013. At Northeastern, he is affiliated with in the Department of Marine and Environmental Sciences, the Marine Science Center, and the Institute for Coastal Sustainability. == Major discoveries == Ries is best known for his contributions to ocean acidification and biomineralization research. He and his colleagues made the publicized and controversial discovery that anthropogenic CO2-induced ocean acidification does not negatively impact all species of marine calcifying organisms, but can also have neutral and even positive effects on some species. Ries also discovered that ocean acidification can alter the shell mineralogy, shell structure, predator-prey dynamics, and calcifying fluid pH of marine organisms, and produced the first geochemical model of the calcifying fluid that could predict organisms' responses to future ocean acidification. Ries and colleagues are also credited with discovering that the current rate of CO2-induced ocean acidification is the fastest in Earth history and that many species of marine calcifiers today inhabit seawater that is already undersaturated with respect to their shell mineral. == Inventions == Ries holds carbon sequestration patents describing biologically and geologically inspired methods for removing and mineralizing CO2 from the flue-streams of fossil-fuel-fired power plants and transoceanic vessels, and producing carbon- negative cement as a byproduct. == Honors == Honors include receipt of the German Award and the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution Ocean and Climate Change Postdoctoral Fellowship. == References == Category:1976 births Category:Living people Category:Scientists from Baltimore Category:American patent holders Category:American male writers Category:Biogeochemists Category:Paleobiologists Category:21st-century American zoologists Category:Sedimentologists Category:American ecologists Category:Franklin & Marshall College alumni Category:Johns Hopkins University alumni Category:University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill faculty Category:Northeastern University faculty Category:21st-century American inventors ","title":"Justin B.

The Wiesbach rises in the North Palatine Uplands and flows into the Nahe near Grolsheim in the county of Mainz-Bingen. It is a 2nd order stream managed by the Wiesbachverband, which operates in the counties of Alzey-Worms and Mainz- Bingen. Together with the Selz and the Appelbach it is one of the most important rivers of Rhenish Hesse. == Geography and geology == The Wiesbach along with the Appelbach, drains the northwestern area of Rhenish Hesse. Its source region lies in the North Palatine Uplands, the northern outliers of the precipitation-rich Donnersberg massif, west of Haide in the borough of Kirchheimbolanden. In the first third of its course the streambed cuts into magmatic rocks and sediments of the Rotliegendes era (285 - 255 MYA). As a result, it forms a system of relatively narrow valleys. Roughly from Nieder- Wiesen to Flonheim it flows through the charming landscape of Rhenish-Hessian Switzerland. Here, apart from the valley meadows, mixed forest predominates on the poor soils. Oberwiesen calls itself a 'forest municipality' (Waldgemeinde). For a long time in this region, the mining of Mercury and quarrying of building stone (especially ) was important. Today, in the source region of the stream (Winkelbach), magmatite is mined in the huge quarries on the Donnersberg and turned into ballast material. The subsequent course of the Wiesbach through the Tertiary deposits of the Rhenish-Hessian Hills flows through a broad valley with gently sloping hillsides. This country with its fertile l√∂ss soils is characterised by wine growing and arable farming. After about , the Wiesbach reaches the Nahe near Grolsheim. == Course == The Wiesbach originates in the vicinity of Rothenkircherhof (above Oberwiesen) from the Winkelbach and the streams around an old poultry farm. It empties into the a side arm of the Nahe near the Rumpf Mill. This side branch joins the main river just before Grolsheim. The stream flows through Oberwiesen, Nieder-Wiesen and Wendelsheim, passing there the Teufelsrutsch (\\"Devil‚Äôs Slide\\") and unites with the Finkenbach. It subsequently flows through (a district of Flonheim), Flonheim, Armsheim, (a district of Armsheim) and Wallertheim, on the eastern edge of which it is joined by the . The Wiesbach then passes, near Gau-Bickelheim, the , where it picks up the Johannsbach (coming from the Wi√überg from the direction of Sankt Johann). It now turns northwest, flows initially through Sprendlingen, then past Welgesheim, Zotzenheim and Gensingen. The stream is accompanied by the railway from Armsheim-Wendelsheim () between Wendelsheim and Armsheimand by the line from Worms to Bingen (Rhenish Hesse Railway) between Armsheim and Gensingen- Horrweiler. == Tributaries == * Steindellerbach (left) * Schanzengraben (right) * Go√üenbach (left) * Ambach (right), 2.5 km * Bach aus den Molkenwiesen (right), 2.6 km * Kernbach (left), 3.9 km * Nebelborn (left), 1.5 km * W√∂rlebach (right), 1.9 km * Bach vom Spitzenberg (left), 1.2 km * Oberwiesenbach (left), 4.6 km * Schniftenbergerbach (left) * Teufelsborn (Teufelswiesenbach) (right), 2.7 km * Dembach (right), 2.1 km * Dornbach (right) * Grubenbach (left) * Nackbach (right) * Finkenbach (left), 7.4 km * Moosbach (right), 3.2 km * Aulheimer Graben (right), 1.8 km * Bornheimerbach (right), 1.6 km * M√∂rschgraben (right), 5.0 km * Bernhardsgraben (right) * Wallertheimergraben (right) * Sulzheimer Bach (right), 4.5 km * Gau- Weinheimerbach (right), 2.2 km * Johannsbach (right), 5.9 km * H√∂llengraben (right), 1.9 km * Bach von of the Sonnh√∂ll (right), 1.5 km * Horrweiler Graben (right), 4.7 km == See also == *List of rivers of Rhineland-Palatinate == References == Category:Rivers of Rhineland-Palatinate Category:North Palatinate Category:Rhenish Hesse Category:Rivers of Germany ","title":"Wiesbach (Nahe)"},{"id":"56058243","text":"Michael Matthew Moroney (6 December 1933 - 15 March 2015) was an Australian athlete.

She started climbing in New Hampshire in 2002, after trying ballet, soccer and horseback riding. Early climbing haunts included regional New England climbing meccas Rumney, Lincoln Woods and Pawtuckaway. Williams joined a Rhode Island based competitive youth climbing team in 2003. In 2017, Williams wrote a personal essay for Rock & Ice magazine about being exposed as a cheater as a young teenager, after falsifying her results in a USA Climbing regional qualifier competition. As a result of her actions, she was banned from competition for the season. In a 2016 interview with Chris Weidner, Williams said that the intense pressure she put on herself to win and a lack of confidence led her to cheat. Returning to competition climbing required Williams to reshape her mental approach, writing that rather than seeking external approval, she would \\"climb because I love it\\". == Bouldering accomplishments == Williams is one of the strongest female boulderers of this generation, according to Gripped Magazine. In 2015, she completed her first V13 (8B) in Rocklands, South Africa on the Ray of Light problem. This was the first female ascent (FFA) of this route. Williams is especially noted for her accomplishments in highball bouldering, in which the climber attempts a very tall boulder problem without rope protection, combining the physicality of bouldering with the mental discipline of free soloing. In 2017, Williams successfully completed the first female ascent of the Ambrosia route in the Buttermilks of Bishop, California. The V11 route tops out at 50 feet, so tall that the lack of ropes creates a formidable mental challenge for the climber. It has been conquered by only a handful of climbers, and her ascent was heralded as \\"one of the hardest free solos ever done by a woman\\" by Climbing magazine. Williams has also completed two other difficult routes on the same boulder, Evilution Direct (V11) and Footprints (V9) to complete the \\"Grandpa Peabody Trifecta\\", the first woman ever to do so. In February 2018, she became the first woman, and only the fourth person ever at the time, to send Window Shopper (V12) in Boulder, Colorado. In March 2019 she made the seventh ascent (and FFA) of Too Big to Flail (V10) a 50 ft highball in the Buttermilks. == Other work == Williams has climbed up to a 5.13 in sport climbing and worked on improving her trad climbing skills. In February 2018, Williams was in training to free climb El Capitan in Yosemite, California, telling Outside Magazine, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm hoping to build a reservoir of power that will carry me through the rest of the year as I shift my focus from bouldering to traditional climbing.‚Äù In 2016, she sent Final Frontier, a 5.13b multi-pitch trad route in Yosemite, along with Father Time (5.13b) in 2018. Williams worked as a climbing coach for Team ABC in Boulder, and participates in climbing clinics and events. Williams has multiple sponsors, including The North Face, Scarpa, Organic Climbing and Black Diamond. Williams was featured in 2019's \\"The High Road,\\" a short film that was selected for the Banff Film Festival and shown during the REELROCK 14 tour. The film focused on Williams' method of practicing on rope in preparation for highball bouldering, and chronicles the intensity of challenge inherent in climbing into the \\"no-fall zone\\", culminating with her successful attempt of Too Big to Flail (V10), a 50 ft highball in the Buttermilks of Bishop, CA. == Notable ascents == 2015, Speed of Life V10, Farley, Massachusetts 2015, Footprints V9, Bishop, California 2015, Ray of Light V13, Rocklands, South Africa‚ÄîFirst female ascent 2016, Final Frontier 5.13b, Yosemite, California 2016, Evilution Direct V11, Bishop, California‚ÄîFirst female ascent 2017, Ambrosia V11, Bishop, California‚ÄîFirst female ascent, first woman to complete the Grandpa Peabody trifecta 2018, Father Time 5.13b, Yosemite, California 2018, Window Shopper V12, Boulder, Colorado‚ÄîFirst female ascent 2019, Too Big To Flail V10, Bishop, California‚ÄîSeventh ascent, first female ascent == References  External links== * Category:1990 births Category:American rock climbers Category:Living people Category:People from Pawtucket, Rhode Island Category:Sportspeople from Boulder, Colorado Category:American female climbers Category:American sportswomen ","title":"Nina Williams (climber)"},{"id":"56058350","text":"Hiroo (written: Êµ©Áîü, Êµ©ÈÉé, Â∫ÉÁîü, ÂÆèÂ§Æ, ÂçöÂ§ß, ÂçöÂ§´, ÂçöÈõÑ) is a masculine Japanese given name.

The suspects were alleged to have plotted suicide bombings in St. Petersburg on the weekend of 16‚Äì17 December 2017, with the Kazan Cathedral among the targets. Both the United States Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) were involved in the operation. ==Background== Russia has become one of the main targets of jihadists since it began a military campaign against various Islamist groups in Syria. In October 2015, an airplane with Russian tourists was blown up over Egypt on its way to St. Petersburg. In August 2016, two men with firearms and axes attacked a police station on the Shchelkovskoye highway near Moscow. In April 2017, a suicide bomber blew himself up in a car at the St. Petersburg metro. In August 2017, a single terrorist organized a series of attacks, including mass killings and arson, in the center of Surgut. Three days earlier the FSB had arrested three suspected members of a similar group in Moscow, where they were allegedly plotting attacks during the New Year holidays and the upcoming presidential campaign. ==Raids== According to a statement, a \\"large number of explosives used to make homemade bombs, automatic rifles, munitions and extremist literature\\" were seized during a police operation on13 and14 December. Seven people were arrested. During the operation, the officers also destroyed a laboratory that the suspects had reportedly used to manufacture explosive devices. The FSB issued a video of one of the detainees being questioned. \\"I was supposed to make the explosives and... pack them into bottles with projectiles attached\\" he said. ==Reactions== * Russian President Vladimir Putin officially thanked US President Donald Trump and the head of the CIA for helping prevent a potential terror attack on St. Petersburg. * White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders confirmed on 17 December that Trump had spoken to Putin. * Trump spoke to CIA Director Mike Pompeo \\"to congratulate him, his very talented people, and the entire intelligence community on a job well done!\\" Representing new US national security strategy, Trump said that \\"many people, perhaps in the thousands, could have been killed\\" in this attack. In turn, Pompeo described the event as an example of a positive partnership between Russia and the United States. ==See also== * 2017 Saint Petersburg Metro bombing * 2016 Shchelkovo Highway police station attack * Notre Dame Cathedral bombing attempt * Strasbourg Cathedral bombing plot * Islamic terrorism in Europe (2014‚Äìpresent) ==References== Category:Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant and Russia Category:Russian special forces operations Category:Law enforcement in Russia Category:Police raids on Islamists Category:2010s in Saint Petersburg Category:Islamic terrorism in Russia Category:December 2017 events in Russia Category:Russia‚ÄìUnited States relations ","title":"2017 St. Petersburg raid"},{"id":"56058386","text":"The 2018 Supersport World Championship season was the twenty-second season of the Supersport World Championship, the twentieth held under this name. ==Race calendar and results== {  style=\\"font-size: 85%\\" !colspan=10 2018 calendar - !

The Capuchin Mart√≠ de Barcelona published it in 1929.Doctrina compendiosa. Barcelona. Editorial Barcino. 1929. 157. ==Content and structure == The book has the form of a dialog, in which a group of Valencia citizens ask several questions to a Franciscan about social and political matters, and even about morality and religion. The friar divides the dialog into two parts. The first one, that consists in twenty chapters, deals specially with morality. The second one, that consists in other twenty chapters, deals with practical matters, specially about social and political ones. And the book ends with a final conclusion. == Reasons against Eiximenis' authorship == Nevertheless, some works of Jaume Riera Sans\\"Francesc Eiximenis no √©s l'autor de la Doctrina Compendiosa\\". Quaderns de Filologia de la Universitat de Val√®ncia. 1984 (1). 289-92. and Curt WittlinIntroduction to Doctrina Compendiosa. Val√®ncia. Ed. Denes. 2006. Pp. 7‚Äì36. have proved that Eiximenis was not the author of this book. The main reasons would be the following ones: * Eiximenis never wrote any other book with the form of a dialog. * Six of the nine preserved manuscripts do not have the name of the author. * The author of this work does not make any other internal reference to the Eiximenis' works, as he used to do in his works. * There are few quotations of the Bible and of the Church Fathers and Doctors of the Church. * The way of making quotations in Latin in this work is totally different from the rest of Eiximenis' works. ==Possible author== Curt Wittlin suggests that the author of this work could be Ramon Soler, who was a jurist and important citizen of Valencia, and also a close friend of Francesc Eiximenis. Therefore, this work would be a kind of reminder of the doctrines of Eiximenis, since this book has a lot of similarities with Eiximenis' social and political thought, and with his works where he deals with those matters, such as the Regiment de la cosa p√∫blica. Furthermore, C. Wittlin has found a lot of influence from the works of the mediaeval jurist Albertanus of Brescia.Introduction to Doctrina Compendiosa. Val√®ncia. Ed. Denes. 2006. Pp. 15‚Äì27. It would support the theory that the author was a jurist, like Ramon Soler was. == References == Category:Francesc Eiximenis Category:1929 documents ","title":"Doctrina compendiosa"},{"id":"56058406","text":"Valentina Shaprunova (born 20 April 1937) is a Soviet athlete.

His father, Denny Crabb,A Supplement to the Suffolk Traveller, Or, Topographical and Genealogical Collections: Concerning that County by Augustine Page, 1844, p. 814 was a deacon of the congregational church at Wattisfield. He was a man of private property, who, as his family grew in number, was obliged to farm one of his estates and became a maltster. Habakkuk was a pupil of John Walker, congregational minister at Framlingham, and in 1766 Crabb proceeded to Daventry Academy under Caleb Ashworth. He injured his constitution by close study. ==Career== Leaving Daventry in 1771 he became minister at Stowmarket, where he was ordained on 3 June 1772. In 1776 he moved to Cirencester, and then to Devizes, as assistant to his brother-in-law, John Ludd Fenner, in 1787. On 25 February 1789, upon the death of Thomas Harmer, Crabb undertook the pastorate at his native place, but his theology (he was probably an Arian) was too latitudinarian for the congregationalists of Wattisfield; he resigned the charge on 15 August 1790, and became minister at Royston. The more orthodox portion of the congregation quietly seceded. Crabb was much beloved by his own people, and esteemed by all. He died after a short illness on 25 December 1794. Robert Hall delivered a funeral oration on New Year's Day 1795, assisted by another family friend, John Towill Rutt of London.The Charles Lamb Bulletin Issue 121 (Jan 2003), p 8. Hall stated: > ...the character of Mr. Crabb was too well established, and held in too high > esteem, to have any thing to hope from praise, or to fear from censure. His > mild and gentle spirit rendered it nearly impossible for him to have any > enemies. The innocence and sanctity of his behaviour, the sensibility of his > heart, the fidelity with which he discharged the duties of life, and the > equanimity with which he bore its rebukes and sufferings, will leave a > lasting impression on the minds of all his friends and acquaintance.

He took part in the various stages of the Russo- Circassian War both in a military and a political capacity. Advocating for the cause of Circassian independence in the west and acting as an emissary of the Ottoman Empire in the region. By the end of his life Zanuko had emerged as the leader of the Circassian independence movement. ==Early life== Sefer Bey Zanuko was born near Anapa, the date of his birth is unknown. He descended from the Circassian noble family of Zan. His tribal affiliation is disputed, his ancestors are variously believed to be Kheaks, Shapsugs, Natukhajs, Haitukos or Halashukos. His father Mehmed Giray Bey died when he was young. In 1807, the fortress of Anapa was captured by Russian troops during the course of the Russo-Circassian War and Zanuko was given as a hostage to the Russians by the local population. He was then sent to Odessa, where he was educated in the Rishelevski Lyceum. His service in the Russian army ended abruptly when he fled to the mountains after a personal conflict with his regiment's commander. According to British adventurer James Stanislaus Bell he soon sailed to Egypt where he lived among the Circassian Mamluks until their fall from power. Whereupon he returned to his homeland and married a Nogai princess. At the time Anapa had been conquered by the Ottoman Empire, prompting Zanuko to travel to Constantinople where he entered into Ottoman service. He became the deputy of Anapa governor Hajji Hassan Pasha, receiving the rank of colonel. During the Russo-Turkish War (1828‚Äì1829) Anapa was recaptured by the Russians and Zanuko was taken prisoner. He remained in Odessa until the end of the war, once he was freed he returned to Circassia, taking the role of an ambassador. ==Ambassador in the Ottoman Empire== The Treaty of Adrianople (1829) marked the beginning of the Russian colonization of Circassia through the establishment of military outposts and stanitsas. An assembly of Circassian tribes declared Zanuko as their representative, dispatching him to Constantinople at the head of 200 man delegation in the spring of 1831. The Ottoman agreed to secretly supply the Circassians with weapons and ammunition, while Muhammad Ali of Egypt refused to provide any assistance. Zanuko settled in Samsun where he continued his advocacy. There he met David Urquhart, one of the first people to espouse the Circassian cause in the west and major contributor to the rise of Rusophobic attitudes in British society. In the summer of 1834, Urquhart visited Circassia where he received a petition signed by 11 chiefs requesting the British king to intervene into the conflict. Two more petitions followed in 1835 and 1836 respectively, both were reluctantly rejected by the British ambassador in Constantinople John Ponsonby, 1st Viscount Ponsonby. Lord Palmerston had previously blocked Ponsonby's initiative to include Circassia in the Eastern Question, on account of the feeble state of the Circassian resistance movement. A series of diplomatic protests by the Russian ambassador led to Zanuko's exile to Edirne. Encouraged by Urquhart a group of British adventurers unsuccessfully attempted to run the blockade of the Circassian coast, the Mission of the Vixen created a diplomatic scandal between Britain and Russia. Encouraged by Ponsonby, Zanuko continued to submit appeals to the British albeit to no avail. In the meantime, the militant Sufi Khalidiyya movement overtook the Adyghe Habze as the leading ideology behind the Circassian resistance. Envoys sent by Imam Shamil helped coordinate the activities of the insurgents across the Caucasus and established Sharia law. ==Crimean War== On 4 October 1853, the Ottomans declared war on Russia launching the Crimean War. The Ottomans recruited Zanuko and other Circassians into their army in preparation for an offensive on the Caucasus front in spring of 1854. Zanuko was appointed as the Ottoman governor of Circassia, receiving the honorary title of pasha. On 29 October, two messengers carrying orders for Mohammed Amin Imam Shamil's naib in Circassia were dispatched from Trabzon to recruit fighters in preparation for his arrival. On 27 March 1854, Russia withdrew from its Circassian forts with the exception of Anapa and Novorossiysk as defensive measure due to the intervention of Britain and France into the conflict. In May, an Ottoman fleet carrying 300 Circassians including Zanuko, supplies and military advisors sailed to Sukhum Kale. Zanuko soon clashed with Mohammed Amin, when the latter refused to supply the Ottomans with recruits for fear that they will be pressed to fight outside of their homeland. In July, Amin was also elevated to pasha, exacerbating the power struggle between the two men. In March 1855, troops loyal to Zanuko clashed with Amin's supporters on the banks of the river Sebzh. Zanuko remained in Sukhum Kale until 10 June when he relocated to Anapa which had been recently abandoned by the Russians. In order to bridge the divide in the Circassian society created by Zanuko's rivalry with Amin, the Ottomans placed both under the command of their countryman Mustapha Pasha. The Treaty of Paris (1856) ended the conflict, frustrating at the same time any hopes of Circassian independence. The Circassians remained politically divided and when Mohammed Amin replaced Zanuko as the new governor, the two sides fought a second battle this time on the Sup river. An intervention of tribal elders led to compromise, when the two leaders agreed to jointly travel to Constantinople and have the sultan settle the dispute. However Zanuko broke his oath and remained in Circassia. Zanuko was in fact following secret Ottoman orders as he was tasked with supervising the withdrawal of the Ottoman army from the region during the course of June. He then resettled to the Shapsykhua river, destroyed the port of Tuapse to prevent Amin's supporters from using it as a supply route and called for the latter's assassination. During the second half of the year Zanuko attempted to negotiate a peace treaty with the Russians. In January 1857, a sanguine battle between Zanuko's and Amin's forces took place in Tuapse, Zanuko's son Karabatir emerged victorious. Russian intelligence was well aware of the British and Ottoman involvement in the affairs of the Caucasus. In May 1857, Amin was invited to Constantinople and immediately arrested, and exiled to Damascus, a move previously planned by the imperial Majlis in an effort to improve relations with Russia. At the same time shipments of arms and ammunition to the rebels were halted. Zanuko died in Shapsugh on 1 January 1860, oblivious to the change in Ottoman policy. He was buried in the Vordobgach valley. Karabatir succeeded him as the leader of Circassian resistance. The Russo-Circassian War officially ended on 2 June 1864, the Circassian genocide was to follow. ==NotesReferences== * * Category:Ottoman military personnel of the Crimean War Category:People of the Ottoman Empire of Circassian descent Category:Circassian nobility Category:Circassian nationalism Category:People of the Caucasian War Category:1860 deaths Category:Pashas ","title":"Sefer Bey Zanuko"},{"id":"56058617","text":"Julio Meneghello Rivera (1911 ‚Äì 15 August 2009) was a Chilean physician, scientist, academic, and researcher, considered the initiator of social pediatrics in his country. ==Biography== Julio Meneghello obtained his professional degree in 1936 at the University of Chile. Between 1941 and 1943 he did postgraduate studies at the American universities Harvard, Johns Hopkins, and Cornell. In 1950 he assisted in the establishment of the Pediatric Research Laboratory, which gave rise in 1977 to the . He is considered the father of modern pediatrics in the country, among other things, because he was the first in the world ‚Äì around 1955 ‚Äì to put into practice the systematized use of oral serums to treat acute diarrhea with great dehydration in malnourished children. In addition, he and his team found the ideal composition of these hydrating serums, which (with certain modifications) would be recommended by entities such as the World Health Organization and UNICEF for the management of these minors. The importance of this scientific and pedagogical work was recognized by the medical journal The Lancet in 1978, as one of the most important medical advances of the 20th century for developing countries. In 1995 Meneghello received the Rector Juvenal Hern√°ndez Jaque Medal, awarded by the University of Chile to those members of their community who, in the exercise of their professions, have rendered distinguished services. In 1996 he received Chile's National Prize for Applied Sciences and Technologies for his contribution to eradicating malnutrition and reducing infant mortality in the country. In 2002 he was awarded his country's National Prize for Medicine. Julio Meneghello died of pneumonia in Santiago on 15 August 2009, at age 98. ==References== Category:1911 births Category:2009 deaths Category:Chilean academics Category:Chilean people of Italian descent Category:Chilean pediatricians Category:Chilean scientists Category:Cornell University alumni Category:Deaths from pneumonia Category:Harvard University alumni Category:Johns Hopkins University alumni Category:Medical educators Category:University of Chile alumni Category:20th-century physicians Category:21st-century physicians ","title":"Julio Meneghello"},{"id":"56058623","text":"The 2017 European Cross Country Championships was the 24th edition of the cross country running competition for European athletes.

It was released by Pony Canyon as the album's lead single on January 10, 1990. Although it was not officially released on vinyl, a few copies were produced for promotional use. Kudo performed the song on the 41st K≈çhaku Uta Gassen, marking her third appearance on the program. In 2015, DAM asked their users to select their favorite Shizuka Kudo songs to sing karaoke to and compiled a top ten list; \\"Kuchibiru Kara Biyaku\\" came in at number six. ==Background== The song is described as a retro-sounding pop number, reminiscent of Group Sounds. It was written by Gor≈ç Matsui and composed by Tsugutoshi Got≈ç. Got≈ç and his Draw4 band members Satoshi Kadokura, Takeshi Fujƒ´, Hiroaki Sugawara and Noriyasu Murase created the arrangement while Got≈ç produced the track. It is the first collaboration between Matsui and Got≈ç since \\"Koi Hitoyo\\". Lyrically, the song describes the temptation the protagonist reads on the lips of a potential lover she is being lured by. The opening line of the song is the familiar saying, , which loosely translates to \\"wait a minute!\\". Matsui was inspired by Kudo making it her personal catchphrase at the time to write it into the song. Kudo has described Matsui as \\"observant\\", stating of her working relationship with him, \\"we only exchange emails once a year but he always knows exactly the right lyrics to write\\". ==Cover version== In 2017, Y≈´ichir≈ç Umehara recorded a cover of the song for the Shizuka Kudo-as-sung-by male voice actors tribute album, Shizuka Kudo Tribute. ==Chart performance== \\"Kuchibiru Kara Biyaku\\" debuted at number- one on the Oricon Singles Chart, with 119,000 units sold in its first week. It slid to number two the following week, then to number three, before rising to the top of the chart a second time on its fourth week. The single charted in the top 100 for a total of 18 weeks. The song ranked at number two on the monthly Oricon Singles Chart for the months of January and February 1990, bested first by Tatsuro Yamashita's \\"Christmas Eve\\" and then by Buck-Tick's \\"Aku no Hana\\". It ranked at number eight on the year-end Oricon Singles Chart. ==Track listingCharts== style=\\"text-align:center;\\" - !scope=\\"col\\" Chart (1990) !scope=\\"col\\" Peak position - ! scope=\\"row\\" Japan Weekly Singles (Oricon)  style=\\"text- align:center;\\"1 - ! scope=\\"row\\" Japan Monthly Singles (Oricon)  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"2 - ! scope=\\"row\\" Japan Yearly Singles (Oricon)  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"8 } ==Certification== - ! scope=\\"row\\" Japan (RIAJ)  Platinum  489,000 - ==See also== * List of Oricon number-one singles ==References== Category:1990 songs Category:1990 singles Category:Oricon Weekly number-one singles Category:Songs written by Tsugutoshi Got≈ç Category:Songs with lyrics by Gor≈ç Matsui Category:Shizuka Kudo songs Category:Pony Canyon singles ","title":"Kuchibiru Kara Biyaku"},{"id":"56058642","text":"Cover page from the transcript of Rackham, Read, and Bonney's 1721 trial Jonathan Barnet (fl. 1715‚Äì1720) was an English privateer active in the Caribbean. He is best known for capturing pirates Calico Jack, Anne Bonney, and Mary Read. ==Biography== Lord Archibald Hamilton, Governor of Jamaica, commissioned ten privateers in late 1715 and charged them with hunting pirates. Among them was Barnet, who sailed out in his 90-ton snow Tyger. The Tyger's owners and Barnet posted bond before he sailed. Barnet's six-month commission was periodically renewed by Hamilton and succeeding Governors. Hamilton gave Barnet specific instructions on which flag to fly, on keeping a journal, and where to bring captured prize ships for confirmation, as well as a warning: \\"You are not on any pretence to committ any acts of hostility, on any of H.M. allies, neuters, friends or subjects.\\" In fact Barnet immediately joined the other privateers in raiding the wrecks of the 1715 Spanish Treasure Fleet. Jamaican Deputy Secretary Samuel Page initially blamed Barnet's actions on the sloop Barsheba captained by Henry Jennings, spurring a Spanish emissary to make an angry visit to Jamaica demanding action against the privateers. The Tyger's owners included Daniel Axtell, who also held shares of the privateer (and later pirate) vessels commanded by Leigh Ashworth, James Carnegie, and Samuel Liddell, all of which looted the Spanish wrecks as well. After Barnet's raids came to light, Page was removed from office for consorting with pirates. Governor Hamilton himself was also recalled to England, replaced by Peter Heywood. Governor Heywood would later fume against the rogue privateers who antagonized the Spanish under the flimsy pretense of privateering, remarking, \\"had not Comissions been granted which were given out on pretext of suppressing pyracys, these unhappy disorders had not been committed: and what was said to Jonathan Barnet (as will appear from his deposition) was too great an encouragement to be given to those sort of people.\\" In 1716 Barnet testified against embattled Jamaican Governor Lord Archibald Hamilton, who was removed from office for consorting with pirates. Barnet may have taken a 1717 pardon offered to all pirates who surrendered within a year: by 1720 his commission had been renewed yet again, this time by Heywood's replacement Governor Nicholas Lawes. Barnet sailed late that year on a trading voyage alongside Jean Bonadvis, another former pirate and privateer turned pirate- hunter. Bonadvis spotted a sloop nearby and approached, only to be fired on. He retreated and reported the aggressor's location to Barnet, who left in pursuit. Barnet hailed the vessel, whose drunken crew refused to surrender, and captured it after a brief battle. The vessel turned out to be the William, captained by John \\"Calico Jack\\" Rackham, who had aboard two female pirates, Mary Read and Anne Bonney. The pirates were quickly tried and hanged, though the women managed avoid execution by claiming to be pregnant. Lawes congratulated Barnet: \\"About a fortnight ago a trading sloop belonging to the Island, being well manned and commanded by a brisk fellow one Jonathan Barnet, did us a very good peice of service. He was met by a pirate vessel at the Leward part of this Island commanded by one Rackum in which were 18 pirates more, whom he took and are now in gaol...\\" ==See also== *Nicholas Brown, Robert Deal and Captain Thompson ‚Äì three other pirates captured by Lawes' pirate-hunters *Turn Joe ‚Äì an Irish pirate who sailed in Spanish service and was caught by Jean Bonadvis ==NotesReferencesFurther reading== *\\"The tryals of Captain John Rackam, and other pirates ....who were all condemn'd for piracy, at the town of St. Jago de la Vega, in the island of Jamaica, on Wednesday and Thursday the sixteenth and seventeenth days of November 1720.

He belonged to a school of logicians, called the Parvipontians.Graham Priest, 'What's so bad about contradictions?' in Priest, Beall and Armour- Garb, The Law of Non-Contradiction, p. 25, Clarendon Press, Oxford, 2011. == William of Soissons fundamental logical problem and solution == William of SoissonsHis writings are lost, see: The Metalogicon of John Salisbury. A Twelfth-Century Defense of the Verbal and Logical Arts of the Trivium, translated with an Introduction and Notes by Daniel D. McGarry, Gloucester (Mass.), Peter Smith, 1971, Book II, Chapter 10, pp. 98-99. seems to have been the first one to answer the question, \\"Why is a contradiction not accepted in logic reasoning?\\" by the Principle of explosion. Exposing a contradiction was already in the ancient days of Plato a way of showing that some reasoning was wrong, but there was no explicit argument as to why contradictions were incorrect. William of Soissons gave a proof in which he showed that from a contradiction any assertion can be inferred as true. In example from: It is raining (P) and it is not raining (¬¨P) you may infer that there are trees on the moon (or whatever else)(E). In symbolic language: P & ¬¨P ‚Üí E. If a contradiction makes anything true then it makes it impossible to say anything meaningful: whatever you say, its contradiction is also true. == C. I. Lewis's reconstruction of his proof == William's contemporaries compared his proof with a siege engine (12th century).William Kneale and Martha Kneale, The Development of Logic, Clarendon Press Oxford, 1962, p. 201. Clarence Irving LewisC. I. Lewis and C. H. Langford, Symbolic Logic, New York, The Century Co, 1932. formalized this proof as follows:Christopher J. Martin, William‚Äôs Machine, Journal of Philosophy, 83, 1986, pp. 564 ‚Äì 572. In particular p. 565 Proof V : or & : and ‚Üí : inference P : proposition ¬¨ P : denial of P P &¬¨ P : contradiction. E : any possible assertion (Explosion). (1) P &¬¨ P ‚Üí P (If P and ¬¨ P are both true then P is true) (2) P ‚Üí P‚à®E (If P is true then P or E is true) (3) P &¬¨ P ‚Üí P‚à®E (If P and ¬¨ P are both true the P or E are true (from (2)) (4) P &¬¨ P ‚Üí ¬¨P (If P and ¬¨ P are both true then ¬¨P is true) (5) P &¬¨ P ‚Üí (P‚à®E) &¬¨P (If P and ¬¨ P are both true then (P‚à®E) is true (from (3)) and ¬¨P is true (from (4))) (6) (P‚à®E) &¬¨P ‚Üí E (If (P‚à®E) is true and ¬¨P is true then E is true) (7) P &¬¨ P ‚Üí E (From (5) and (6) one after the other follows (7)) == Acceptance and criticism in later ages == In the 15th century this proof was rejected by a school in Cologne. They didn't accept step (6). In 19th-century classical logic, the Principle of Explosion was widely accepted as self- evident, e.g. by logicians like George Boole and Gottlob Frege, though the formalization of the Soissons proof by Lewis provided additional grounding the Principle of Explosion. == References == Category:Logicians Category:Theorems in propositional logic ","title":"William of Soissons"},{"id":"56058709","text":"Johann Wilhelm Helfer also known as Jan Vil√©m Helfer (February 5, 1810, Prague - January 30, 1840, Andaman Islands) was a Bohemian physician, explorer and naturalist. Many of the plants he collected went to Kew and nearly 140 species were named after him. ==Life== Madame Helfer, n√©e Baroness des Granges, in 2nd marriage Countess von Nostitz, see Ainsworth, 1888, p. 47 ff Helfer came from a wealthy Prague family. He first attended the Prague grammar school and then began studying medicine. He studied at the universities of Prague, Vienna, Padua and Trieste. In 1832 he was appointed Dr. Ing. med. doctorate. On a subsequent trip to Italy he met and married Mathilde Pauline Baroness des Granges (c. 1801‚Äì 9 July 1881). The couple decided to travel from Trieste through the Middle East towards India. Their Ô¨Årst natural history collections were made near Smyrna where Helfer practised medicine. They continued to Aleppo. In Aleppo, Helfer was invited to join Colonel Francis Rawdon Chesney's Euphrates expedition as the expedition's naturalist. The expedition began the journey down the Euphrates on 22 March 1836. The Euphrates expedition continued, but the Helfers left it at Balis in May, after sending two crates of specimens to the British Museum (lost at sea). Parting from Chesney the Helfers traveled from Syria to the Persian Gulf to begin the six-week voyage to Calcutta. They stopped in Baghdad and Bushehr, and then in Muscat (Oman), arriving in Calcutta on 20 August 1836 where they stayed with acquaintances of Chesney and later at the Chowringhee Boarding House. Helfer collected plants and lectured on natural history to the Asiatic Society of Bengal. John Clark Marshman (1794‚Äì1877), editor of the weekly newspaper Friend of India encouraged the East India Company which had founded the botanic garden in Calcutta in 1787 to employ Helfer as a naturalist. During this time, he kept in contact with the German geographer Carl Ritter, who used the information provided by helpers for his volumes 10 and 11 of his geography. Helfer explored the Tenasserim provinces and the Mergui Archipelago (now in Burma) on behalf of Company. The Helfers left Calcutta on 21 January 1837 aboard the Elizabeth and travelled down the River Hooghly and across the Bay of Bengal to Moulmein. From this base he wrote a series of detailed reports on his observations on mining and forestry. Sometime during 1837, the Helfers started a plantation near Myeik focusing on palm trees, coffee and nutmegs and in 1837 and 1838 he sailed the shores of India and Burma. On 30 January 1840 Helfer was struck by a native arrow during a last trip to the Andaman Islands. His body was never recovered. Following Helfer's death, his widow gave her husband's collections to the Bohemian Museum (55,249 natural history specimens, representing 47,833 beetles belonging to 1,700 species, 609 bird skins, 14 mammal skins, 508 Lepidoptera and 6,086 herbarium specimens or collections, representing at least 574 species). In 1844, Pauline Helfer married Count Joseph Dittmar von Nostitz-Rokitnitz (1794‚Äì1871). In 1873 and 1877, she published two volumes recounting their travels and adventures in the Middle East and Indo-Burma. ==Works== *Helfer, J.

They take their name from the genus Larix (larches), which contains inside most of the species of the group and is one of only two deciduous genera of the pines complex (together with Pseudolarix, which however belongs to a different subfamily, the Abietoideae). Ecologically important trees, the Laricoideae form pure or mixed forest associations often dominant in the ecosystems in which they are present, thanks also to their biological adaptations to natural disturbances, to reproductive strategies put in place and high average longevity of the individuals. Currently are assigned to this subfamily three genera (Larix, Pseudotsuga and Cathaya) and its members can be found only in Northern Hemisphere. The various species live for the most part in temperate or cold climates and are the more northerly conifers; some constitute an important source of timber and non-timber forest products. == Description == The species of the subfamily Laricoideae are evergreen or deciduous trees that can reach the greater heights in the Pinaceae family (over 100 meters with Pseudotsuga menziesii var. menziesii). The leaves are needle-like and have primary stomatal bands only on the abaxial surface (below the phloem vessels). All members are monoecious, with separate sexes on the same plant but in different reproductive structures. The annual cones (strobili) have no distinct umbo and the scales show a broad base which, at observation, completely hides the seeds from the abaxial view. These last are whitish and firmly fixed to the wing (this thin membrane also keeps the seed well attached to the scale during maturation). Furthermore, among the typical distinctive features of the group, we have the micropylar fluid of the strobilus absent, no resin vesicles on the seeds and the presence, in the vascular cylinder of the young root, of two characteristic small resiniferous canals. The bark and the wood of the genera Larix and Pseudotsuga have a similar anatomy and morphology: the reddish color of the heartwood and the white-yellowish of the sapwood, the high specific weight compared to other conifers, the distribution of late and earlywood, the presence of resiniferous channels and their localization in the tissuets, the molecules that form the resin and extractives, the chemical, physical and mechanical properties as well as the class of resistance to the attack of pathogens such as fungi and insects are a clue of a common ancestral origin. == Taxonomy == The subfamily Laricoideae was described with the actual name by Robert Knud Friedrich Pilger and Hans Melchior in late 1954 and subsequently modified by other authors in the course of time as regards the taxa of belonging. Before that, the genera Larix, Pseudotsuga and Cedrus were gathered in a provisional subfamily called Laricinae, defined for the first time by Melchior and Werdermann always in 1954 (...‚Äútrees that have both short and long shoots, monomorphic leaves, and strobili borne on the short shoots‚Äù...) and rechristened immediately after with the current term. The grouping in this form was confirmed by Hart (1987) through cladistic analysis, but already in 1988 Frankis replaced Cedrus with Cathaya (a genus described for the first time in 1962) in a new classification (now obsolete) that saw Larix as a distinct twin group compared to Cathaya - Pseudotsuga. Historically the Laricoideae were the subfamily of the Pinaceae comprising the trees with needles inserted both on the macroblasts and on the brachiblasts; for this reason in the past they have been also included in it the genera Pseudolarix (for a short time) and Cedrus, subsequently eliminated following the most recent systematic updates developed on the basis of molecular genetic phylogeny, reproductive morphology, chromosome numbers and immunology. Currently, based on these studies, there are three genera in the subfamily Laricoideae, of which one of which is monotypic as it consists of only one species: {  - ! Image !! Genus !!Description!! Living species - 120px  Larix  Larches are the genus type of this subfamily. Deciduous trees, they live in cold climates at elevate altitude in the mountains of temperate zones or at high latitudes in the Northern Hemisphere. They are found in North America, Central Europe and Northern Asia (Russia, Japan and China).  * Larix laricina (Du Roi) K. Koch * Larix lyallii Parl. * Larix occidentalis Nutt. * Larix decidua Mill.

The leaves are needle-like, evergreen, 2.5‚Äì5 cm long with ciliates margins when young; they grow in spiral patterns around sprig. Cones 3‚Äì5 cm long with 15-20 scales, each scale bearing two winged seeds. This conifer grows in Southern China, in provinces of Guangxi, Guizhou, Hunan and southeast Sichuan on steep mountain slopes between the 950 and 1800 m of altitude.  *Cathaya argyrophylla Chun & Kuang - } Within the subfamily the genera Larix and Pseudotsuga are more closely correlated to each other (sister taxon) than Cathaya. This evidence is demonstrated by numerous biological and morphological similarities between the larches and the Douglas-firs, including a various tissues common anatomy, immunology of seed protein and the absence of the two air sacs in the pollen, typicals instead of the other Pinaceae. The similarities between the pollen grains of the genera Larix and Pseudotsuga however do not stop here and include other aspects as: granules not buoyant, atectate, with external wall (exospore) granular, pollination drop containing xylose and the presence of an exine shell during microgametophyte germination. Doyle and O'Leary (1935) furthermore described a pollination process very similar in Larix and Pseudotsuga where the granule, which lacks air sacs, lands on an almost stigmatic extension of the integument, the margins of which tend to inroll. The contact with the nucellus may (Larix) or may not (Pseudotsuga) be needed for pollen tubes to develop, but the mechanism is almost analogous. The time from pollination to fertilization in these two genera may be over a year and the granules germination can take months (Little et al., 2014). Pinaceae subfamilies in the classification version currently most widespread and used (Nothotsuga is missing): Larix and Pseudotsuga are sister genera compared to Cathaya Price et al. he supposed in 1977 that the Laricoideae were a subfamily sister of the Abietoideae rather than the Pinoideae - Piceoideae group and this version was confirmed by Hart (1987), Frankis (1988), Farjon (1990), Wang et al. (2000) and Gernandt et al. (2008), although it has not yet found application in the literature. === Dichotomous key === The dichotomous key to recognizing the genera included to the subfamily Laricoideae is relatively simple, since only three of them belong to it and one of these is deciduous. Below is reported the taxonomic identification scheme in the form of a table: {  -  1\\\\. _Laricoideae_ (includes Larix, Pseudotsuga and Cathaya): 2 : 2. _Deciduous trees_..................................Larix ssp. : 2. _Evergreen trees_ : 3 :: 3. Medium to extremely large trees; often resemble species of Abies or Tsuga; cones pendulous, persistent scales, three- pointed bract sticking out between scales............................Pseudotsuga ssp. :: 3. Leaves needle-like, 2.5-5 cm long, ciliate margins when young, grow in spiral patterns around stem; cones 3-5 cm long, 15-20 scales, each scale bearing two winged seeds...............Cathaya argyrophylla } === Revisions === According to the latest research still in progress, the genus Cathaya would be attributed to the grouping of pines (subfamily Pinoideae), leaving therefore only Larix and Pseudotsuga to forming the subfamily Laricoideae. Furthermore, studying the mitochondrial rps3 gene, Ran et al. (2010) found that Larix and Pseudotsuga are evolutionarily sister genera to all other Pinaceae, highlighting a different (sub-parallel) origin compared than the other species. Spellenberg, Earle and Nelson (2014) report that the larches and Douglas firs evolved from the Pinaceae 135 million years ago and have had a common ancestor until 7 million years ago, thus forming a divided and closely related taxonomic line between them compared to the rest of the group, while maintaining a strong degree of kinship with it. This version, that would find evidence in the genetics, however is not universally accepted and many botanics, researchers and scientists still use the previous classification waiting for further developments. For other authors, finally, the subfamily Laricoideae would have no taxonomic dignity of its own, recognizing only two large multi-group clades (Pinoid and Abietoid) or subfamilies (Pinoideae and Abietoideae) in their classification systems. Larix, Pseudotsuga and Cathaya would be included in the pines complex. ==See also== * Pinaceae ** Abietoideae ** Pinoideae ** Piceoideae * Larix * Pseudotsuga * Cathaya * Subfamily == References  Bibliography === *Pinaceae, Drawings and Descriptions of the Genera: Abies, Cedrus, Pseudolarix, Keteleeria, Nothotsuga, Tsuga, Cathaya, Pseudotsuga, Larix and Picea.

Anthony Memorial Committee of California and a longtime defender of women's rights. ==Early life== Alice L. Park was born in Boston. ==Career== Alice L. Park was a pacifist; she opposed the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War of 1898. In 1894 she joined the International Feminist Movement and picketed the White House. She framed two pieces of California state legislation: the 1909 California Bird and Arbor Day Act legislated the protection of trees and birds and established a day for school children to be instructed in these environmental issues; and the bill which ensured equal guardianship of minor children to both parents. Previously, the man had complete legal control ‚Äì even insofar as selling their unborn children. In the 1910s she was State Chairman of the Literature Committee of the Political Equality League. She was a member of the Women's Suffrage Association for 60 years. Once women's suffrage was legalized in California in 1911, she was a speaker at the International Woman Suffrage Alliance Congress in Budapest, Hungary, in 1913. She campaigned for: 6 hour work day; labor unionism; anti-child-labor laws; birth control; sex education in schools. In 1914 she declared: \\"I sympathize deeply with the tactics of the militants in London. I am tired of the English women being blamed for crudeness and for their violence. To them a great deal of credit is due for getting the votes for women in California, in giving publicity to the cause. If they did not destroy property and do things out of the ordinary, no one would pay any attention to them, and their action would be a pure loss.\\" She quit the Unitarian society over its failure to oppose World War I. She was a Delegate to International Women's Congress for Peace and Freedom at the Hague in 1915; in 1915 she was a member of Ford Peace Ship; she was a leader of the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom (WILPF). She founded Palo Alto Women's Peace Party in 1915. She protested Stanford University‚Äôs establishment of a female quota for women and battled for women's rights. In her homes (at 611 Gilman and 510 Hamilton streets) she held meetings for a pacifist group called the American Union Against Militarism. This later became the American Civil Liberties Union. In 1926 she met with Mahatma Gandhi to discuss his non-violent philosophy. ==Death== Alice L. Park died on October 18, 1961, at her home in Palo Alto. She was 100 years old. ==Legacy== In 1948, Una R. Winter wrote Alice Park of California: worker for woman suffrage and for children's rights. Peers Park (1899 Park Blvd, Palo Alto, CA 94306) was established to honor Alice Locke Park and her love of trees. ==References== Category:1861 births Category:1961 deaths Category:People from Boston Category:American suffragists Category:American centenarians Category:Women centenarians ","title":"Alice Locke Park"},{"id":"56058752","text":"The 2017 Java earthquake occurred on 15 December 2017 when a moment magnitude 6.5 earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Java, specifically the city of Tasikmalaya on 23:47:58 West Indonesian Time (16:47:58 UTC) in West Java, Indonesia. The earthquake struck at a depth of 91 km and was categorized as a strong but deep earthquake. It was initially registered as a 7.3 magnitude earthquake by Indonesian agencies. Widespread damages have been reported across Tasikmalaya, the nearest major city to the epicentre. A tsunami warning was immediately issued by the authorities but was subsequently cancelled. Four people have been confirmed dead. == Earthquake == The earthquake struck with a moment magnitude of 6.5 Mw near Tasikmalaya, West Java at 23:47 local time. The epicentre was reportedly located 11 km from Tasikmalaya. Strong shaking were widely reported across West Java, Central Java, Banten, Yogyakarta and Jakarta. Hundreds of people rushed out from high rise buildings in the capital Jakarta. People in Yogyakarta also reported strong shaking during the earthquake. In Bali the earthquake was registered as a light shaking in the Mercalli intensity scale. Strong shaking was also reported in Mataram, West Nusa Tenggara. The earthquake struck at 23:47, meaning that most residents were sleeping during the earthquake. The earthquake was initially registered as a 7.3 Mw and prompted a tsunami warning due to its intensity. There were also unconfirmed reports which claimed that there were two earthquakes in Java. Confusion and panic immediately ensued and sounds of horns were heard everywhere as streets were jammed. People who were living in the coastal area were told to evacuate to high grounds. Tsunami warnings and advisory were in effect in several locations in Java, particularly in Tasikmalaya and Pangandaran. The Indonesian Agency for Meteorology, Climatology and Geophysics stated that tsunami warnings were issued in Ciamis and Tasikmalaya. Tsunami advisories were in effect in the following regencies and cities in Java: Bantul, Kulonprogo, Cianjur (Sindangbarang), Garut, Sukabumi (Ujung-Genteng), Cilacap, Kebumen. Rise in water level has been reported in Tasikmalaya. However, Indonesian official later confirmed that there was no tsunami. The warning was subsequently cancelled on 02.26 WIB. Authorities later advised people to return to their homes. == Aftermath == Widespread damages were reported in cities near the epicentre. At least 40 houses collapsed and 2,953 were heavily damaged. A municipal hospital was damaged in Banyumas, while a man was killed in Ciamis as his house collapsed due to the earthquake. An elderly woman was killed in a house collapse.Strong earthquake rattles Indonesia's Java island; 2 dead, ABC News from Associated Press, 15 December 2017 Another injury was reported in Kebumen after a house collapsed. Photos of damaged structures were widely shared in social media. Numerous houses were either damaged or collapsed in Pangandaran Regency, West Java. A woman died in Bantul because she panicked and fell when the earthquake happened. A person died of a heart attack in Ciamis during an earthquake. Two women were killed by fallen debris in Pekalongan and Ciamis. Immediately after the earthquake, reports of blackouts were widely received by the government. Government officials in Cilacap, Central Java reported that at least 504 structures across Cilacap Regency were either badly damaged or destroyed due to the earthquake. Eight schools reportedly collapsed in Garut. A stadium in Wonosobo, Central Java was badly damaged. As many as 2,935 structures across Java were damaged, most of them were structures in West Java. Indonesian National Board for Disaster Management in Tasikmalaya received reports that 6,000 structures were damaged. The total cost of damage that was caused by the earthquake was estimated to be at around Rp 4,6 billion. President Joko Widodo was immediately informed about the earthquake and subsequently ordered aids for the people affected by the quake. Social Minister Khofifah Indar Parawansa announced that the government would send supplies of foods and medicines. The Social Ministry announced that aids equivalent to Rp 823 million have been delivered to the hardest hit areas. Hundreds of personnel were deployed to clear debris. The earthquake revealed that tsunami detection system in Indonesia was still minimal. Twenty two tsunami buoys were found to be inoperative since 2012. == References  * Category:2017 earthquakes Category:2017 in Indonesia Category:Earthquakes in Indonesia 2017 earthquake Category:December 2017 events in Indonesia Category:2017 disasters in Indonesia ","title":"2017 Java earthquake"},{"id":"56058842","text":"√âdouard Guillaume (1881‚Äì1959) was a Swiss physicist and patent examiner, notorious for his published papers attacking Albert Einstein's theory of special relativity. He is also noteworthy for his work on mathematical economics. √âdouard Guillaume was the younger cousin of Charles √âdouard Guillaume, who won the Nobel prize in physics in 1920. Both of the Guillaume cousins received doctorates in physics from the Zurich Polytechnique (ETH Zurich). √âdouard Guillaume (the younger cousin) worked at the Swiss patent office where Einstein worked from 1902 to 1909. Beginning in 1913 Guillaume began publishing in the Archives des Sciences Physiques et Naturelles papers arguing for a Lorentzian electrodynamics with a universal time. He claimed that Einstein's theory mistakes changes in the units of measurement for physical changes and that time can be regarded as absolute. Beginning in 1917, Einstein started to reply to some of the letters Guillaume sent to him. The correspondence went on for a number of years, but Einstein was unable to convince Guillaume. In 1915 he moved from the Swiss patent office to the Swiss Federal Office for Insurance. From 1916 to 1946 when he retired, he worked for the Swiss insurance company La Neuch√¢teloise, of which he became a director. For the academic year 1936-1937 he lectured on financial economics as a privat docent at the University of Neuch√¢tel. √âdouard Guillaume was an Invited Speaker of the ICM in 1920 in Strasbourg, where he presented his ideas concerning relativity theory.Guillaume, E. \\"Expression mono et polyparametrique du temps dans la theorie de la relativit√©.\\" In Comptes rendus du Congr√®s international des math√©maticiens: Strasbourg, pp. 22‚Äì30. 1920.

Contacts between the two countries were sporadic during the 1950s and 1960s, improved during the 1970s but became frosty in the 1980s. ==Early years== In 1924 Matzenau, the former envoy of Liberia to Russia, tested the waters with the Soviet government on establishing bilateral relations. The Soviets initially expressed interest in the proposal, but no diplomatic links materialized. ==Tubman era== In 1946 negotiations for a Liberian-Soviet friendship treaty took place, but no agreement materialized. In 1952 the Liberian government sent an invitation to the Soviet Union to attend the second presidential inauguration of William V.S. Tubman. The Soviets declined the invitation. In January 1956 a Soviet delegation attended the third presidential inauguration of Tubman, the first Soviet ambassadorial level representation in sub-Saharan Africa. The Soviet delegation at the inauguration was led by Alexander P. Volkov, Chairman of the Supreme Soviet. Volkov offered economic aid to Liberia, but the offer was rejected by Tubman. The New China News Agency lauded the establishment of a Soviet diplomatic presence in Africa as a backlash for Western imperialism. Over the coming years contacts between the two countries were sporadic. The Soviets invited Tubman to visit Moscow in 1956, but the invitation brought a counter-reaction from the United States, Liberia's traditional ally. Tubman was informed that a state visit to Moscow would affect US-Liberian relations negatively. Tubman remained skeptical of Soviet intentions, and declined formalization of diplomatic relations. In September 1957 a Liberian agricultural delegation visited the Soviet Union. In June 1959 a Liberian health delegation visited the Soviet Union, followed by an agricultural delegation the following month. Nuritdin Mukhitdinov led the Soviet delegation at the fourth presidential inauguration of Tubman in January 1960. In November 1960 a delegation of Liberian local government officials visited the Soviet Union. In February 1962 a Soviet scientific team, led by Cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin, visited Liberia. In August 1962 the Liberian Vice President William R. Tolbert Jr. visited the Soviet Union. In October 1962 a Soviet cultural delegation visited Liberia, followed by a Liberian cultural delegation to the Soviet Union in April 1963 and a Soviet cultural troupe to Liberia in December the same year. ==Tolbert era== Liberian-Soviet relations improved during the presidency of Tolbert. One year after assuming the Liberian presidency, there was a mutual agreement (issued in Monrovia and Moscow) in June 1972 on establishing embassies. The first Liberian ambassador to the Soviet Union was Francis A. Dennis, his Soviet counterpart in Monrovia was Dmitri Safonov. Safonov was later replaced by A.A. Oulanov. In 1974 Liberia accepted economic aid from the Soviet Union. After a 1976 agreement, Liberian students were given scholarships to study in the Soviet Union. On May 19, 1979 a Liberian-Soviet Scientific and Cultural Agreement was signed. A Liberian parliamentary delegation visited the Soviet Union May 26-June 1, 1977. The delegation was led by Richard A. Henries, Speaker of the House of Representatives. A delegation of the Supreme Soviet visited Liberia November 16-22, 1978. During the final months of the Tolbert presidency, relations deteriorated and some Soviet diplomats were expelled from Liberia. ==Doe years== Liberian-Soviet relations deteriorated under the Samuel Doe presidency, who would align himself closely with Ronald Reagan. Nevertheless, the Soviet Union, Cuba, Libya and others were initially positive to the Doe-led coup in 1980. Soon after the coup, Doe renewed diplomatic links with the Soviet Union. Under the People's Redemption Council regime, James E. Morgan was named ambassador to the Soviet Union. He was later followed by Christopher Ricks. On October 24, 1980 an agreement was signed on air services between Liberia and the Soviet Union. In 1983 Doe expelled Soviet diplomats from Liberia, including the ambassador Oulanov, accusing the Soviet Union of supporting a Libyan plot to remove him from power. Oulanov was declared persona non grata on November 22, 1983. The Soviets expelled Ambassador Ricks in retaliation. Doe closed the Soviet embassy in Monrovia on July 18, 1985. Fourteen Liberian students were arrested, accused of sharing intelligence with the Soviet embassy. On August 3, 1985 the Soviets reciprocated by closing the Liberian embassy in Moscow. Reportedly Zaire would represent Liberia in the Soviet Union after the break of diplomatic links, and Poland would represent the Soviet Union in Liberia. Normal diplomatic relations were restored in July 1986. In 1989 a delegation of the Union of Soviet Journalists visited the Press Union of Liberia, a visit that Doe warily allowed. ==See also== *Foreign relations of Liberia *Foreign relations of Russia ==References== Liberia Soviet Union ","title":"Liberia‚ÄìSoviet Union relations"},{"id":"56058969","text":"Frydag family (also: Vrydach, Freytag, Freydag and various other slightly different spelling's) is a noble German family, known since the beginning of the 14th century, and who originated from the Uradel of Westphalia and were first documented between 1198 and 1217 with the person of Wecelo Vriedach. At the end of the 13th century, Westphalian aristocrats, among them also members of the Frydags, moved to Prussia and Livonia to fight with and in the Teutonic Order for the spread of Christianity. By marrying in 1574 with the heiress of the G√∂dens Castle in East Frisia, the Frydag's gained great prestige and wealth. Since 1644 some family lines have been using the title Baron and since 1692 other lines have been using the title Count. The Freytag family has played an important role in German history, especially in the form of high- ranking knights of the Livonian Confederation, but also in the person of the supplier of the bomb to assassinate Hitlier as part of the 20 July plot, Wessel Freytag von Loringhoven. In addition, the general Hugo von Freytag- Loringhoven is cited more frequently as a military writer on questions of the Worlar. The same applies to the lawyer Axel Baron von Freytagh-Loringhoven in the Weimar Republic. ==Name Forms== The spelling of the different branches of the Freiherr family diverges: * from Frydag * from Freytag called L√∂ringhoff * Freytag by Loringhoven (also by Freytag-Loringhoven) * Freytagh by Loringhoven (also by Freytagh-Loringhoven) Additional name additions were: * to Husen (near Syburg), extinguished in 1655 * to Buddenburg, extinct 1908 * to Sandfort (at Olfen-Vinnum), extinct in 1717 * to Goedens, imperial freemen 1649, imperial counts 1692, extinct 1746 * to Grevel (near Syburg), extinct in 1546 * to Drenhusen * to Hockerde (near Syburg) Furthermore, the following spellings were used as well: Vriedach, Fridagh, Frydag, Freydag, Frejdag. The Baltic born members of the family lead as part of the name the former predicate \\"Baron\\", provided that no substitution was made by \\"Freiherr\\". ==HistoryWestphalia=== The pavilion of House Buddenburg that was owned by the Frydag line from the 14th century to 1902. The pavilion was but a small part of House Buddenburg In the 1199, the first instance of the name Wecelo Vriedach is found in a document from the library of Count Gottfried of Arnsberg and again 1217 as mentioned as witness in a document belonging to the Otto I of Oldenburg, Bishop of M√ºnster. In the first half of the 13th century, the family is found as the Ministralen of the bishops of M√ºnster and Bishopric of Minden, in the second half they are with the Archbishop of Cologne and in the pens of the abbeys of Essen and abbeys of Herford. In 1326, a Goswin of Datteln called Fridag, was sealed with the Heraldric Coat of arms, consisting of Three Rings Crest. To the other first tangible carriers of this name, Johann von der Berswordt in his Westphalian family tree leads from 1624 belong to Theodericus Frydag, meles et castelanus in Recklinghausen , who witnessed in 1366 in a document of the monastery of Oelinghausen and Konrad Frydag 1316 his house and farm sold in Dortmund to the Dominicans to build a monastery. It is believed that the abbot Meinerus Frydag to Deutz, who died in 1330, was a brother of the above. Probably Hermann Frydag was a son or grandson of Konrad Frydag who stood in court of Count Engelbert II of the Mark in his feuds and as a witness often confirmed the documents issued by Count Engelbert in 1370. An Eberhard von Frydag was from 1385 to 1390 the 21st abbot of the former monastery of Cappenberg Castle. Arnold and Golfried Frydag signed the union of the Margrave nobility on the Laurentiustage 1419. In 1421 the uninterrupted genealogy of the Frydag family begins, when Eberhard Frydag acquired the estate of Loringhoven near Recklinghausen, and assumed the name of the estate as his surname. His descendants still bear the name Freytag von Loringhoven. This Eberhard also possessed estates in the Duchy of J√ºlich, which he received from the Palatinate Counts. House Wischlingen House Buddenburg was from the 14th century to 1902 owned by the line Frydag to Buddenburg, with the name becoming extinct in 1908, which also had Loxten in the 17th century. House Grevel came into possession of the family in 1350, the local line went out 1546. House Wischlingen came in the second half of the 14th century two daughters in equal parts to the families of Frydag and Ovelacker; the Frydag part came over the family of Plettenberg in 1511 to that of Syberg. Godert and Arnt Frydag married the heirs Aleke and Belke von Husen and thus came into the possession of the Niederhofes and the Oberhofes in Husen in Syburg, today Castle Husen and House Husen, that remained in possession until 1655. In 1421, Diederich Frydag van den Husen acquired the house Sch√∂rlingen and in acquired the house L√∂ringhof south of Datteln, which until the 17th and 18th Century remained in the possession of the family, but which was later demolished in 1961. Around 1450, two brothers of the family, went to the Baltics, this seat being named for the Baltic branches (see below, German Order ). From 1550 to 1719 Sandfort Castle was owned by the family. A line sat on Hockerde, Pentling and Drenhusen (near Syburg). In 1574, the East Frisian G√∂dens came to the family as a marriage estate, which built a Baroque palace there, Schloss G√∂dens which was passed on to its present owner, Count Wedel, in 1746 (see below, Ostfriesische line). Georg Wilhelm Freiherr von Frydag from G√∂dens inherited the estate Daren in 1742 from his first wife Sophia Johanna von Schade and who built a new mansion there in 1752. Of all Westphalian branches flourishes until today only the line of barons of Frydag on Daren. Since 1907, the brickyard Olfry in Vechta, founded by August Freiherr von Frydag on Daren, has been family-owned.

The archbishop was captured by some of his knights, including Johann Frydag. They had to buy their freedom with 32,000 gold florins. But this did not bow Dietrich and in the following year of 1446 he sent with several others from the nobility to the Duke Reinold von Geldern a feudal letter. The brothers Andreas Frydag and Johann Frydag from L√∂ringhoff moved to Prussia in the middle of the 15th century to assist the Teutonic Order in its wars against Poland. The latter entered the German Order of Knights. His courage and valour combined with spiritual gifts earned him the post of army commander of the Livonian Order, whom he practiced for 37 years. In 1489 he appointed Wolter von Plettenberg Country Marshall (). In 1491, he was able to end the 200-year civil war in Terra Mariana, so that until 1561 a time of cultural prosperity could exist. His brother Andreas became a merchant and a father. The third brother Melchior (* 1466) is the common progenitor of the line in Prussia in the provinces of the Mark and M√ºnster. The existence of German- Baltic and German-Baltic branches of the family that existed for many centuries, i.e., in the original home of settled lines and the descendants of mostly younger sons, who had already emigrated to the Order in the Middle Ages and settled there, is also recorded in other noble families, the Vietinghoff, the Korff, the Wenge/Lambsdorff, the Grotthu√ü/Grothaus(en) or the Waldburg- Capustigall families. ===East Frisian line to G√∂dens=== With the brothers Franz and Bertold, the family divided in the middle of the 16th century in the East Frisian and Westphalian line. Water Castle, G√∂dens Franz Frydag (1555-1606) married Almuth von Olden-Bockum, Almuth Boing and heiress of G√∂dens's daughter. So the family received the glorious G√∂dens and Uiterstewehr castles in East Frisia in 1574. He was a founder of several lines, of which one was raised soon after in baronial and Ducal status, but ceased in 1746. Franz held the position of a court judge in Aurich, after he had received the approval for the establishment of a Court of Justice by Count Johan II of East Frisia (1590). When he died, he left behind a daughter Margaret, who was married and had four sons, of whom the oldest Oldenbockum was the family name of his mother as a baptismal name John on the mountains to Rephorst (use the in) Northern Germany often took place). He lost his life during the Siege of Rees (1602). Other sons were Haro (1578-1637) and Melchior Ernst (1579-1641), who shared the glories of the G√∂dens and Uiterstewehr lines and thus were heirs too two further family lines. * Melchior Ernst (1579-1641) distinguished himself in the Dutch‚ÄìPortuguese War and married Beate Sophia von Boineburg aus dem Hause, i.e. of the house of Hohnstein Castle. His great-granddaughter Hendrina was married to the East Frisian administrator of the Principality of Nassau-Siegen, Nicolaus Moritz Frese to Hinte and therefore heritage of glory Uiterstewehr. This branch of the family became extinct in 1748. * Haro Ernst (1578-1637) was chief of G√∂dens and Drost to Leer and was sent to the imperial court in Vienna in 1624 by the Lower Saxony county stadiums to lodge complaints, against the invasion of the Catholic League troops under Field Marshal Johann Tserclaes, Count of Tilly and his tendered war contributions. He left a total of three sons and four daughters of two women Katharina Freiin von Innhausen and Knyphause and Elisabeth von Haaren, including: :* Herbert died in 1642 unmarried, as Bailiff () to Emden. :* Johann Wilhelm married Johanna von Diepenbrock and became the founder of a line in Westphalia. :* Franz Hyko (born 9 January 1606) led as chief to G√∂dens the main stem. He received his father's job as Drost zu Leer and in 1639, after marrying Elisabeth von Westerholt , heiress of Castle Hackfort, converted back to the Catholic religion. He was promoted on 3 February 1644 by Emperor Ferdinand II in the Imperial Baron (Freiherr). Franz Hyko had several children: ::* Hedwig Orianna (1648-1694) was the wife of Dodo von Knyphausen, and known to L√ºtetsburg and Johanna, wife of Count Jan von Beuren. ::* Haro Burchhard, (1640-1692), devoted himself with his brother Franz Heinrich (1643-1693) to the legal sciences at German, Dutch and French academies and made according to the custom at that time with his brother, the cavalier tour of Europe. On his return, he was appointed chamberlain by Emperor Leopold I. Because of his knowledge, he received the post of Reichshofrat in Vienna and died unmarried in Hamburg as an imperial representative at the Lower Saxony circle. From 1671 he had the water castle G√∂dens built in its preserved form today. ::* Karl Philipp (1644-1698) entered the Order of Malta. After having made imperial service against the Turks in Hungary as well as some campaigns on the Mediterranean against the Barbarians , he became Grand Prior in Hungary and died in Valletta in 1698 when he was preparing a new campaign against Tunis. ::* Hico Wilhelm (1645-1711) and Johann Ernst (1649-1703) chose the spiritual status and entered the Jesuit order. The former died as an excellent pulpit speaker in Mastricht, the latter as rector of the Jesuit College in Halle Brabant. ::*Franz Heinrich, brother of Haro (1643-1694) married Sophia Elisabeth von Aldenburg, the daughter of Count Anton von Aldenburg (House of Oldenburg) and his wife Auguste Gr√§fin zu Sayn-Wittgenstein. He followed the career of his older brother. He was appointed imperial chamberlain and Reichshofrat and from 1656 appointed as an ambassador to the court of the principality of the Margraviate of Brandenburg (German: Markgrafschaft Brandenburg) in Berlin. After the death of his brother, he also received his place at the Lower Saxony circle, one of the administrative groupings in the Holy Roman Empire. He and his brothers were promoted by Emperor Leopold on 2 January 1692 in the Imperial Count. He had two sons and a daughter: :::* Franz Wilhelm (1686-1722) entered the Royal Saxon Army. He died a Lieutenant colonel in the Garde du Corps during a stay in Vienna in 1722. :::* Burkard Philipp (1685-1746) also followed the diplomatic career of his father and uncle. After returning from universities and travels, he entered the circle of Imperial Chamberlains and Privy Councilors and Emperor Charles VI added. As an envoy to the Nordic courts in Stockholm and Copenhagen, he developed his diplomatic skills. He kept his position until his death in Copenhagen, where he died in 1746 at the age of 61 years. He was married to Ebela Auguste Countess Bielke the daughter of the royal Danish Major General Count Christoph Bielke (1654-1704). His wife brought good things like Lopkeld, Oberaha, Nederowe into the family. His son of the same name died shortly after birth. This extinguished the line. The heirs were the descendants of his sister Maria Juliane (1684-1727), who was married to the royal Danish general Erhard Friedrich von Wedel-Jarlsberg (1668-1740). Their son Anton Franz von Wedel (1707-1788) now inherited the glory of G√∂den, which is since then in the possession of the Counts of Wedel ==Coat of Arms== The root coat of arms shows in blue three (2: 1) silver rings.

It was established in 1980 as Oncodevelopmental Biology and Medicine, obtaining its current name in 1984. It is owned by the International Society of Oncology and BioMarkers, of which it is the official journal. Originally published by Karger Publishers, it moved to Springer Science+Business Media beginning in 2010. In December 2016, the journal moved again, this time to SAGE Publications. The editor-in-chief is Magdalena Chechlinska (Curie Institute, Warsaw). According to the Journal Citation Reports, the journal has a 2016 impact factor of 3.650. ==Editors== Tumor Biologys founding editor-in-chief was William H. Fishman (La Jolla Cancer Research Foundation), who edited the journal along with Hidematsu Hirai (Hokkaido University) from 1980 to 1983. In 1984, A. Munro Neville (Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research) took over as editor-in-chief, and in 1995, he was replaced by Sabine von Kleist (Albert Ludwigs University of Freiburg). In 1999, von Kleist retired, at which point he was replaced by Torgny Stigbrand (Umea University), who was still the journal's editor as of May 2017. In May 2017, Science Insider reported that multiple scientists listed on the journal's website as being members of its editorial board had no affiliation with the journal. One scientist, German Nobel laureate Harald zur Hausen, told Science Insider that he did not know he was on the list, and that he did not recall having ever reviewed a paper for the journal. ==Retractions and delisting== In April 2017, Springer announced it was retracting 107 papers that had been published in Tumor Biology while they were publishing it. According to Retraction Watch, this made Tumor Biology the journal with the most retracted articles out of all the journals indexed by the Web of Science at the time. The cited reason for the retractions was that the papers in question had been accepted on the basis of fake peer reviews. Specifically, the authors of the now-retracted studies had supplied fraudulent email addresses to external reviewers which purportedly belonged to their \\"recommended reviewers\\". This led to these papers receiving fake reviews and eventually being published. In response, the Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China announced that it would investigate the retractions, as all 107 papers were co-authored by Chinese researchers. In July, the Ministry announced that, based on the results of its investigation, it would punish the Chinese researchers who co- authored the retracted papers with disciplinary actions, including banning some of them from conducting additional research.

Nykanen began his career as a journalist for New Times Weekly in Phoenix, before becoming a news director at KDKB radio and news anchor for Arizona PBS. He then received four Emmy awards for his work as an on-air correspondent at NBC News; an Edgar Allan Poe Award for writing the NBC documentary Silent Shame: The Sexual Abuse of Children; and shared a Dupont-Columbia Award for Investigative Journalism. After NBC, Nykanen served as the Press Secretary for California Governor Jerry Brown‚Äôs 1992 campaign for the Democratic nomination for President. He later became an author, publishing five novels under his own name and two under the pseudonym James Jaros. ==Early life== Mark Nykanen spent his childhood years in Arizona. During the Vietnam War period, he became a war resister. He attended college but did not graduate. ==Journalism== During the 1970s Nykanen was a reporter for Phoenix‚Äôs New Times Weekly. One of his first prominent news investigations was into the Arizona State Prison Complex ‚Äì Florence, where his undercover work saw him banned from the facility, and his articles clipped from newspapers before they were distributed to the inmates, in an attempt to suppress his discoveries. His prison reporting contributed to the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights investigation of the inhumane conditions of prisons in Arizona. Nykanen then became an on-air news reporter and news director for KDKB radio in Phoenix, and he was later the news anchor for the Arizona Weekly television broadcast on KAET. During this time he received several Arizona Press Club Awards in print, radio, and television, including an investigation into the Arizona Revenue Department that led to the resignation of several of its top officials. In 1980, Nykanen began working for NBC News as a correspondent, and continued his investigative journalism. In September, 1982, he began working on a documentary uncovering an international ring of child pornography and prostitution that spanned from Holland and Denmark to the American Midwest. The documentary was aired nationwide on NBC as an hour-long special under the title Silent Shame: The Sexual Abuse of Children. The New York Times called the broadcast, ‚Äúas good an examination of a difficult topic as we are likely to see on television.‚Äù During the documentary, Nykanen interviewed child molesters on camera and connected them to the lucrative child pornography industry. The show was awarded the Emmy for Outstanding Investigative Journalism in the Programs category. During the 1980s, Nykanen broadcast other reports on NBC Nightly News. In 1982, he was nominated for an Emmy in Outstanding Investigative Journalism, Segments category for his report Land Hustles. In 1983 Nykanen uncovered the use of German Nazis as US spies in the days following World War Two. He also headed the investigative reporting unit for the NBC television news magazine Monitor. In 1985, Nykanen won the Emmy for Investigative Journalism in the Segments category for his on-camera reporting for Military Medicine, an expos√© on malpractice in the U.S. military that aired on NBC Nightly News. Nykanen also investigated the use of dangerous pesticides and the regulatory failures of the FDA, for which he won an Emmy. He retired from NBC in 1988. Following this, he spent some years providing news copy for the television show Hard Copy, including the writing and directing of much of its coverage of the O. J. Simpson trial. He also later wrote for the Lifetime television show Beyond Chance. ==Politics== In 1992 Nykanen served as the press secretary to Jerry Brown during his bid for the Democratic nomination for President. In that role, he discussed with the media Brown's expectations in the primaries and election results, as well as other questions regarding his campaign. ==Novels== Mark Nykanen's novels have been translated into French, German, Italian, Czech, Dutch, Russian, and Mandarin. His first novel was the 1998 book Hush. The work began as a short story based upon a nightmare he had while suffering from a fever, which his literary agent encouraged him to turn into a novel. The plot tells the story of a homicidal child abuser in Oregon who seeks to silence a woman trying to expose his crimes. She discovers his violent past while working as an art therapist with one of his young victims. Nykanen's next novel was The Bone Parade, released in 2004. It tells the story of a serial-killer sculptor who uses the bodies of his victims in his art. The book is written from both third-person and first- persons points of view, with the first-person sections representing the internal dialogue and mindset of the murderer. The German translation became a best-seller in Germany. In 2005 Nykanen then released the novel Search Angel, which follows the story of an investigator who helps adoptees looking for their birth parents‚Äîand the parallel story of a serial killer who targets women who gave their children up for adoption. The murderer then stalks the investigator herself after discovering she had given up a child earlier in her life. In 2009, he released the novel Primitive, the story of a middle-aged model who is kidnapped by eco-renegades and held captive in their secluded compound. In 2011, he published Striking Back, about a serial killer who murders members of a therapist's spousal abuse support group. The same year, under the pseudonym \\"James Jaros\\", Nykanen published the post-apocalyptic novel Burn Down the Sky, based on a world decimated by climate change and a killer virus. In 2012, he released the novel Carry the Flame under the same pen name, which follows the story of a caravan of people braving a scorched American Midwest populated by roving bands of violent outlaws. Both novels take place in a world where global warming has wrought catastrophic change. ==Personal life== In addition to Nykanen's continued anti-war protests, he has been involved in public debates about climate change science. During 2003 he and his wife moved to Canada in protest of the US invasion of Iraq. In 2015 they moved back to the U.S. In 2017, Nykanen and his wife returned to Canada, stating the reason was the result of the 2016 presidential election. He and his wife hold citizenship in both countries. Nykanen is married to Lucinda Taylor, who works as a health and family counselor. ==Recognition== Nykanen received four Emmy awards over his career, an Edgar Allan Poe Award, and shared a Dupont-Columbia Award for Investigative Journalism. In 2018, Nykanen appeared on the show United Shades of America.https://www.cnn.com/videos/tv/2018/05/21/usoa-canada- ron2.cnn/video/playlists/w-kamau-bell-united-shades/ ==References== Category:Living people Category:Emmy Award winners Category:Edgar Award winners Category:20th-century American journalists Category:20th-century American novelists Category:21st-century American novelists Category:American press secretaries Category:American documentary filmmakers Category:American crime writers Category:21st-century American non-fiction writers Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Mark Nykanen"},{"id":"56059145","text":"Christopher Aiden-Lee Jackson (born 1977) is a professor of geology at Imperial College London.

Skin conditions like hyperhidrosis, lichen planus, psoriasis, eczema, and urticaria may be caused in instrumental musicians due to occupational exposure and stress. Allergic contact dermatitis and irritant contact dermatitis are the most common skin conditions seen in string musicians. ==Allergic contact dermatitis== Rosin, the material commonly used to wax string instruments is known to cause allergic contact dermatitis in musicians. Nickel, a metal found in musical instruments causes allergic contact dermatitis on the fingers and hands of string instrumentalists and in the lip and neck of wind instrumentalists. Wind instrumentalists with lip and neck infection should switch to silver, gold or plastic mouthpieces if allergic dermatitis occurs. (R)-4-methoxydalbergione present in rosewood may cause allergic contact dermatitis in violinists. Cane reed (causing chelitis in saxophone players), propolis (a wax used to close structural gaps in musical instruments), paraphenylenediamine (used to polish musical instruments) and potassium dichromate (tanning agent to the skin of the harp) also cause allergic contact dermatitis in musicians. ==Irritant contact dermatitis== * Fiddler's neck - It is seen in violinists due to non- eczematous irritant contact. Lichenification and hyperpigmentation can be seen. It is different from classical irritant contact dermatitis because the etiology is multifactorial : friction (leading to lichenification), local pressure, shearing stress and occlusion. Viola players are more pre-disposed to this condition because of the larger size of the instrument. * Cellist's chest and cellist's knee - It is seen in cello players due to the irritant contact of the instrument. * Flautist's chin - Irritant contact dermatitis seen in the chin of a wood/brass instrumentalist. * Clarinetist's cheilitis - Chelitis in a clarinet player. Caused due to friction, pressure, stress and occlusion. ==Skin trauma== Frequent, chronic contact of instruments to skin may make it callous by the thickening of stratum corneum. Use of 'thumb position' in cellists may cause callosity of left thumb. Garrod's pads are seen on the dorsal left second and third fingers over the proximal interphalangeal joints in violinists. Drummer's digit is the callosity seen on the lateral phalanx of the left finger. Callosities need treatment only when they are excessive or symptomatic. ==References== Category:Dermatitis Category:Occupational diseases ","title":"Skin conditions in instrumental musicians"},{"id":"56059226","text":"Juma Abudu (born 11 November 1963) is a Kenyan weightlifter.

According to Luis Galarreta, the President of the Congress, the whole process of impeachment could have taken as little as a week to complete. This event is part of the second stage of the political crisis generated by the confrontation between the Government of Pedro Pablo Kuczynski and the Congress, in which the opposition Popular Force has an absolute majority. The impeachment request was rejected by the congress on 21 December 2017, for failing to obtain sufficient votes for the deposition. ==Background== Prior to the beginning of the process to remove him from office, President Kuczynski was accused by the congressional opposition of lying about receiving bribes from the Brazilian construction company Odebrecht, as he had initially denied receiving any payments at all from the them, but later admitted that he had in fact been receiving payments to a firm he owned, Westfield Capital Ltd, while continuing to deny any irregularities in those payments. A number of other Latin American politicians had previously also been implicated in similar accusations of part-taking in financial irregularities involving Odebrecht, including Colombian president Juan Manuel Santos, Mexican president Enrique Pe√±a Nieto, Venezuelan president Nicol√°s Maduro, former Peruvian presidents Alan Garc√≠a, Alejandro Toledo and Ollanta Humala, as well as Keiko Fujimori, chairwoman of the party Popular Force and daughter of the former president Alberto Fujimori, and whom Kuczynski had narrowly defeated in the 2016 general election. Upon the initiation of impeachment proceedings Congress president Luis Galarreta stated that he expected Kuczynski to be removed from office ‚Ä≥within a week‚Ä≥, as Kuczynski's Peruvians for Change party occupies only 18 of the 130 seats in Congress, while the opposition right-wing Popular Force (which is chaired by Keiko Fujimori) and left-wing Broad Front (headed by a former priest and environmental activist called Marco Arana), both in favor of Kuczynski's removal, together command 81 of the necessary two-thirds congressional majority (87 seats) needed to remove a president from office. According to reports by the Reuters news agency, Kuczynski had also lost the support of his own cabinet members, who had begun to urge him to resign as well. On 14 December 2017 he was also given an ultimatum by the congressional opposition to resign by the end of the day or face impeachment in Congress, to which he responded by saying: \\"It cost us a lot to get our democracy back.

She took classes with the painter Carlos Isamitt and later, while still in school, attended evening classes at the School of Fine Arts of the University of Chile. After high school, she continued her higher education at the aforementioned university from 1944 to 1949. There she had as teachers Augusto Eguiluz, Carlos Pedraza, and Pablo Burchard, the latter having the greatest influence on her style. Barrios began her teaching career in 1953, at her alma mater, as an assistant in the drawing workshop of Carlos Pedraza. Later she assumed other positions, until 1973. During the 1960s she belonged to Grupo Signo, which broke with post-impressionism and advocated an abandonment of easel painting. Among the other members of the group were Alberto P√©rez, Jos√© Balmes, and Eduardo Mart√≠nez Bonati. In 1962 the group held exhibitions in Spain and France. After the 1973 Chilean coup d'√©tat, the artist went into exile in France along with her husband and daughter; they remained out of Chile for approximately ten years. Upon returning, Barrios worked as a visiting professor at the Catholic University from 1983 to 1986, and beginning in 1994 was a professor at Finis Terrae University. She ended her teaching career some years later. \\"Before, art was more democratic because it revolved more around the University of Chile [...] That's why there were artists from all social spectrums. For some time, creation has gone hand in hand with economic power, with having a good surname, with moving in certain spheres. I miss doing classes, but that is one of the reasons why I left it,\\" explained the painter. In 2011, she won the National Prize for Plastic Arts for her work that, according to the jury, \\"is distinguished by its incessant search for the human condition and, above all, by the relationship of the human being with its existential and historical contexts.\\" ==Work== Imagen con caballo negro, mural no. 2 of the The work of Gracia Barrios focuses on \\"human activity in everyday life.\\" Although she initially opted for figurative painting, towards the 1960s she changed to a more informal style, called \\"informal realism\\" by the artist herself. With this, Barrios alluded to the man \\"by means of the monumentality of torsos, heads, and maternities, expressing also the direct approach with the American continent and its people.\\" Some of the themes she tackled in her paintings were war, indigence, and exile. In addition to using oil and acrylic paints, the artist experimented with natural elements such as earth and clay in order to give greater density to her works. Her paintings have been exhibited in countries such as Spain, France, Germany, Brazil, and Japan, and adorn not only Chilean museums, but also some European ones, such as the Barcelona Museum of Contemporary Art and the Andr√© Malraux Museum of Le Havre. ==Personal life== In 1943, while attending free courses at the University of Chile, Barrios met the Catalan painter Jos√© Balmes. They were introduced by the poet Enrique Lihn. They married in 1952 and had a daughter, Concepci√≥n Balmes, who is also a painter. Garcia Barrios died on 28 May 2020 at the age of 92. ==Awards and recognitions== * 1957 ‚Äì First Prize for Drawing, 68th Official Salon, Santiago * 1958 ‚Äì Second Prize for Painting, 69th Official Salon, Santiago * 1959 ‚Äì Second Prize, 70th Official Salon, Santiago * 1964 ‚Äì Second Prize, Esso Salon, Museum of Contemporary Art, University of Chile, Santiago * 1965 ‚Äì First CRAV Prize for Painting, Santiago * 1965 ‚Äì Second Prize, Painting, Esso Salon for Young Artists, Pan American Union, Washington, United States * 1966 ‚Äì First Prize for Painting, 76th Official Salon, Santiago * 1968 ‚Äì Second Prize, American Biennial of Quito, Ecuador * 1971 ‚Äì Prize of Honor of the 15th √ëu√±oa Salon, Santiago * 1988 ‚Äì Achievement Award, Mural of the Worker's Hospital, Santiago * 1996 ‚Äì Municipal Art Prize, Municipality of Santiago * 2011 ‚Äì National Prize for Plastic Arts ==References== Category:1927 births Category:2020 deaths Category:20th-century Chilean painters Category:21st- century painters Category:Art award winners Category:Artists from Santiago Category:Chilean exiles Category:Chilean people of Portuguese descent Category:Art Informel and Tachisme painters Category:Pontifical Catholic University of Chile faculty Category:University of Chile alumni Category:Chilean women painters Category:20th-century women artists Category:21st-century women artists ","title":"Gracia Barrios"},{"id":"56059573","text":"The 2017‚Äì18 Kennesaw State Owls women's basketball team represents Kennesaw State University during the 2017‚Äì18 NCAA Division I women's basketball season.

The series, set to be co-written by del Toro, Travis Beacham, and Rene Echeverria, is based on a feature film spec script written by Beacham, entitled A Killing on Carnival Row. The company ordered three scripts with the expectation that if the series went into production del Toro would direct the first episode. On June 6, 2016, the production was given a pilot order with the previously announced creative team still set to be involved. On May 10, 2017, the production was given a series order with Beacham and Echeverria still executive producing, and with Echeverria expected to act as showrunner. Filmmaker Paul McGuigan was set to direct the series. By this point, del Toro had stepped away from the project, as his feature film schedule did not permit him to stay on as an executive producer as the project moved forward. On November 10, 2017, filmmaker Jon Amiel replaced McGuigan as director. On June 3, 2019, it was announced that the series would premiere on August 30, 2019. In July 2019, Amazon renewed the series for a second season. ===Casting=== In August 2017, Orlando Bloom and Cara Delevingne were cast in the series' two lead roles.

He was named All-State in 1997 and accepted a scholarship to play football at Furman University. During his time with the Furman Paladins, Napier was a four-time letterman, and took over the starting quarterback duties for his junior and senior seasons. The Paladins won two conference championships during Napier's time there, and he was selected to two All-Southern Conference teams at quarterback. In his junior year, he led his team to the 2001 NCAA Division I-AA Football Championship Game, losing to Montana, 13‚Äì6. Napier earned second-team All-Southern Conference honors in 2001 and 2002.http://eweb.furman.edu/athletics/football/seasons/2001/%2701pressreleases/NationalChampionship.pdfhttps://citadelsports.com/news/2002/12/3/12_3_2002_3287.aspx ==Coaching careerEarly coaching career (Clemson, SC State)=== After graduating from Furman, he headed to Clemson as a graduate assistant. Following a two-year stint as a GA at Clemson, he was then hired as the QB coach at South Carolina State in 2004. After only one year with SC State, Napier chose to return to Clemson when he accepted a job with dual roles as tight ends coach and recruiting coordinator on Tommy Bowden's staff. In his third year as TE coach and recruiting coordinator, Tommy Bowden resigned midseason after early season struggles that failed to meet high expectations, and Napier gave up his roles as RC and TE coach when he was named QB coach by newly appointed interim head coach Dabo Swinney. His new role also included assisting Swinney with the playcalling duties for the remainder of the year. ===Alabama, Colorado State, and Arizona State=== When Swinney was promoted from interim head coach to full-time head coach after the 2008 season, Napier was promoted to offensive coordinator while retaining his duties as QB coach. After a 2009 season where Clemson would go on to win the ACC Atlantic Division behind the strength of Napier's offense that scored a then school record 436 points, Napier's 2010 offense output declined mightily ultimately leading to Napier's termination at the end of the 2010 season. Within only a few weeks of being dismissed as OC at Clemson, Napier was contacted by Nick Saban from Alabama and offered a job as an offensive analyst. After spending the 2011 season as an analyst on Saban's staff, Napier earned a championship ring following Alabama's win over LSU in the BCS National Championship Game. As a result of his experience under Saban during the 2011 season as well as the time spent working closely with fellow Alabama assistant Jim McElwain, Napier was able to get back into hands on coaching by following McElwain to Colorado State to become the QB coach and assistant head coach. Napier didn't stay in Colorado for long as Saban brought him back to Tuscaloosa at the end of the 2012 season to take over as WR coach going into the 2013 season. After a four- year stint as Alabama's WR coach including a second national championship in January 2016, he was hired by Todd Graham to become offensive coordinator at Arizona State. In his first season back at OC since being fired as Clemson's OC back in 2010 Arizona State finished with a 7‚Äì5 record and a Sun Bowl trip with Napier's offense leading the way. Arizona State fired head coach Todd Graham after the 2017 season and brought in former NFL coach Herm Edwards who stated publicly that Napier would be able to continue in his role as OC if he would like. However, Napier declined the opportunity to remain at ASU as the offensive coordinator. ===Head coaching career (Louisiana)=== On December 15, 2017 Napier accepted the head coaching job of the Louisiana Ragin' Cajuns. This is Napier's first time as a head coach of a college football team. After arriving in December of 2017, his first season with the team resulted in a win of the western SBC division, and a bowl appearance (Cure Bowl losing to the Tulane Green Wave), resulting in an overall record of 7‚Äì7.

It includes 52 deals in which each of the 52 cards of the pack plays a significant role, described by and interspersed with comments from the playing cards themselves, the anthropomorphic \\"People of the Pack\\". ==Background== Darvas (1906-1957) was the best-known Hungarian bridge journalist of his day. Hart (1888after 1947) was an English bridge player and writer. Austrian bridge player and theorist Paul Stern had (being a Jew and also strongly anti-Nazi) sought refuge in London after Nazi Germany occupied Austria in the 1938 Anschluss. According to the Introduction to the book by English bridge writer Guy Ramsay, Stern had known Darvas in the 1930s and in his exile had become friends with Hart. Stern proposed a book by the two of them, combining the Hungarian's fantasy and wit and the Englishman's fancy and humour. Soviet Russia, which had taken control of Hungary after World War II, considered bridge a decadent game. By devious routes Darvas smuggled out his ideas for bridge deals to Stern, who passed them on to Hart, who wrote the narrative. There were still difficulties to overcome; they were solved by English bridge player and writer Ben Cohen, who gave the book its title and even managed to arrange for Darvas to come to England to see it through to publication. ==The book== The narrator has been involved in bridge all daywriting an article, playing rubber bridge, and taking part in a practice match. In the early hours of the morning, alone in a club cardroom puzzling over a deal from that day, the 52 cards speak with him and with each other, and each one tells him a story of a deal in which they had played a significant part. The narrator proposes to write a book about the tales of the People of the Pack; they are delighted by the idea. In the daylight, a club steward enters the cardroom and opens the window blinds. The steward asks the narrator if he has been asleep. \\"No, I have not been asleep.\\" All 52 deals contain points of technical interest, from the whimsical through the practical to the highly advanced. (For example, the penultimate deal involves the extremely rare hexagon squeeze, and the final deal describes a novel coup named the Robert coup after its discoverer, Robert Darvas.) Every card in Hart's narrative has their own distinct personality, and each suit has its own personality traits. The book includes a handful of cartoons which depict some of the cards. They are uncredited, but resemble in style some of those by Fougasse, co-author and illustrator of the 1934 humorous book about bridge Aces Made Easy. The title page acknowledges Stern's contribution as \\"Comp√®red by Dr. Paul Stern\\"; he also provided the Foreward. ==The Robert coup== The 52nd and last deal in the book is \\"The Tale of the Four of Diamonds\\". It describes a coup, attributed to and named in honour of Robert Darvas, which involves (1) a ruff-and-discard, ruffed by the longer trump hand (or by both declarer and dummy) to shorten the trump holding and so preserve an exit card, and (2) forcing the other defender to ruff with a high trump to prevent a lower trump taking a trick en passant, and so endplaying him in the trump suit. The deal was: The bidding went: {  style=\\"float:left; margin-top:10px;\\" - ! South !! West !! North !! East -  1  Pass  2  3 -  4  Dbl  All pass  } { - The play began (with winning cards boldfaced): -  Trick 1: Q, K, 2, A -  Trick 2: K, A, 2, 4 -  Trick 3: 10, A (declarer has no chance unless E has singleton K), K, 2 -  Tricks 4-7: 3 to Q (a finesse), then A, Q, J -  Trick 8: 2, 8, 9, K } The position is now, with East to lead: Declarer ruffs the forced return with 4 (shortening his trumps to the same number as West) and overruffs in dummy with 5.

In 1968 the government of the Republic of Vietnam \\"publicly condemned\\" the use or trafficking of cannabis, and instructed local chiefs to prevent its cultivation. In 1969, USAID's Office of Public Safety began eradication of cannabis fields, including aerial eradication in the Mekong Delta. The program was popularly resented and also politically unpalatable; in 1971 OPS was advised not to eradicate cannabis in areas controlled by the H√≤a H·∫£o sect, for fear of driving them to join the National Liberation Front. In the 1960s, the United States government became concerned with cannabis use by US troops in Vietnam. Though alcohol was the drug most commonly used by American troops in the Vietnam War, cannabis was the second-most common. Initially rates of usage among deployed soldiers were comparable to those of their stateside peers, with 29% of troops departing Vietnam in 1967 reporting having ever used marijuana in their lives. A 1976 study however showed that from 1967‚Äì1971, the proportion of troops having used marijuana peaked at 34% before stabilizing to 18%, while the number of troops who had used cannabis prior to deployment stayed around 8%. ==References== Vietnam Category:Drugs in Vietnam ","title":"Cannabis in Vietnam"},{"id":"56060050","text":"Humphrey Mountain is a summit located in Adirondack Mountains of New York located in the Town of Wells north of the hamlet of Wells. ==References== Category:Mountains of Hamilton County, New York Category:Mountains of New York (state) ","title":"Humphrey Mountain"},{"id":"56060069","text":"Horseshoe Mountain is a summit located in Adirondack Mountains of New York located in the Town of Wells northeast of the hamlet of Wells. ==References== Category:Mountains of Hamilton County, New York Category:Mountains of New York (state) ","title":"Horseshoe Mountain (New York)"},{"id":"56060092","text":"County Line Mountain is a summit located in Adirondack Mountains of New York located in the Town of Wells northeast of the hamlet of Wells. ==References== Category:Mountains of Hamilton County, New York Category:Mountains of New York (state) ","title":"County Line Mountain"},{"id":"56060106","text":"Seniors and Juniors is a 1999 album and the first Studio album by Marshmallow Coast == Track listing  References == Category:1999 albums Category:Marshmallow Coast albums Category:Kindercore Records albums ","title":"Seniors &amp; Juniors"},{"id":"56060119","text":"South Pond Mountain is a summit located in Adirondack Mountains of New York located in the Town of Wells northeast of the hamlet of Wells. ==References== Category:Mountains of Hamilton County, New York Category:Mountains of New York (state) ","title":"South Pond Mountain"},{"id":"56060131","text":"Mossy Mountain is a summit located in Adirondack Mountains of New York located in the Town of Wells north of the hamlet of Wells. ==References== Category:Mountains of Hamilton County, New York Category:Mountains of New York (state) ","title":"Mossy Mountain"},{"id":"56060141","text":"The Odyssey 30 is an American trailerable sailboat, that was designed by Carl Alberg and first built in 1960 in the San Francisco bay area.

It is based on the play Baal by Bertolt Brecht. The film disappeared after Brecht's widow saw it on television and demanded that it no longer be shown. Ethan Hawke asked Schl√∂ndorff about seeing the film at the Cannes Film Festival, but Schl√∂ndorff replied that did not know where it was. Eventually the film was discovered in rusty, unmarked cans filed under S. At that point, the film was restored. It was given its first home video release by Criterion in 2018. The film did not make the 1919 play a period piece, and some of the interiors featured intentionally over-the-top colors. It was the first film Dietrich Lohmann shot in color. Margarethe von Trotta was the first actor cast. Fassbinder joined for the title role after Schl√∂ndorff's first choice was unavailable. Much of the supporting cast and crew came from Fassbinder's company, whom he did not want to be put out of work by his absence. == Plot and themes == The film \\"explores the cult of the genius\\" as \\"an anti-heroic figure... chooses to be a social outcast and live on the fringe of bourgeois morality.\\" In the film, \\"Volker Schl√∂ndorff transposes Bertolt Brecht‚Äôs late- expressionist work to latter-day 1969\\", as [p]oet and anarchist Baal lives in an attic and reads his poems to cab drivers.

The species arose after the extinction of the non-avian dinosaurs. Fossils were found in New Zealand, and the discovery was announced in December 2017. == General information == The order Sphenisciformes refers to all living and extinct penguin species. In 2017 an article on one of the largest and oldest species of the order herewith discovered was published. It was discovered at Hampden Beach in the Otago region of New Zealand. This organism is named Kumimanu biceae, of which the genus name translates from Maori as \\"monster bird\\", while the specific name honours the nickname of the mother one of the authors. Standing approximately five feet and three to ten inches (1.60 to 1.77m) tall, and weighing over , being thus the second largest penguin thus far known. This is a particularly significant discovery because the fossil is fifty-five million years old ‚Äî meaning it lived in the Paleocene era ‚Äî which is many million years older than all other previously found remains of penguins which reached 'giant' sizes, and thus the third or fourth oldest penguin known (pending new publications). Therefore, it allows scientists to better understand the evolution of penguins. == Discovery and analysis == The fossils were found by a group of researchers from New Zealand in Otago, on the South Island of New Zealand. The fossils are from the Paleocene Waipara Greensand formation. The fossils were studied by a New Zealand and German team, led by Gerald Mayr of the Senckenberg Research Institute and Natural History Museum. He was the lead author of an article on the subject published online in December 2017. == Ecology and behavior == Kumimanu biceae lived in New Zealand, which was subtropical during much of the Paleocene era. There were many organisms in these waters including sea turtles and various fishes. K. biceae were likely similar to modern-day penguins in the way they lived. However, these ‚Äúmonster birds‚Äù were likely able to consume larger prey due to their size. == See also == * Kairuku * Extinction event == References == * Jadwiszczak, Piotr, et al. ‚ÄúRedescription Of Crossvallia Unienwillia: The Only Paleocene Antarctic Penguin.‚Äù Ameghiniana, vol. 50, no. 6, 2013, pp. 545‚Äì553., doi:10.5710/amgh.09.10.2013.1058\\" * \\"Ancient Mega- Penguin Reached Human Height\\" * Malcolm Ritter: \\"Ancient penguin was as big as a (human) Pittsburgh Penguin\\", retrieved 15 December 2017.

An official at court during the late reign of the Kangxi Emperor, Alingga played a major role in the succession struggle between the sons of the emperor. Born into a prominent imperial family as the son of Ebilun, Alingga's sister was one of the Kangxi Emperor's highly ranked consorts, and his daughter married Yunli, the Prince Guo. ==Biography== Alingga's birthdate is unknown. He was the seventh son of Ebilun, one of the main advisors to the Kangxi Emperor in the latter's early reign, Alingga grew up in a prominent household. He initially was an imperial bodyguard, then niru (‰ΩêÈ†ò). Alingga became a top officer of the emperor's personal protection unit and the Manchu head of the Bordered Yellow Banner military force. His elder sister was Noble Consort Wenxi (Ê∫´ÂÉñË≤¥Â¶É), a highly ranked imperial consort of the Kangxi Emperor. After she died, Alingga represented his family in mourning her. Alingga did not get along with his older brother Faka (Ê≥ïÂñÄ) and frequently attempted to cast sorcery spells against him. Alingga had inherited the first- class duke title originally bestowed upon Faka after the death of their father. Faka complained about Alingga's behavior to the emperor. The emperor, incensed at Alingga, dismissed him from his posts but retained his noble title. He was later restored as a first-class bodyguard and a leader of the Plain Blue Banner Mongol forces. He later was named an officer of the imperial guard, and minister responsible for Lifan Yuan. In 1708, the 47th year of Kangxi's reign, Alingga became one of the most vocal supporters of Yunsi for the position of crown prince, and was criticized by the emperor, as Yunsi was not in imperial favor. Alingga died in 1716, the 55th year of Kangxi's reign. His daughter Lady Niohuru became wife to Yunli, the Prince Guo. He was also father of Arsungga, a major official during the reign of the Yongzheng Emperor. The Yongzheng Emperor reserved particular scorn for Alingga, possibly as a result of the latter's endorsement of Yunsi during the battle for succession. In 1736, the Yongzheng Emperor said to his assembled officials, \\"in today's court, the most treacherous, most selfishly bent on seeking their own gain; the worst of them are Alingga and Kuiju\\".Kuiju (ÊèÜÂèô) was the son of Mingju The emperor accused Alingga of spreading rumors in order to support the cause of Yunsi assuming the position of crown prince. Additionally, the emperor placed on Alingga's tombstone the remarks \\"he was not a good subject, not a good younger brother, violent, and mediocre.\\"Original in Chinese: ‰ª§Â§∫ÂÆòÔºåÈÅ£ÂæÄÂ•âÂ§©ÂÆàÂÖ∂Á•ñÂ¢ìÔºõÂπ∂Â∞ÜÈòøÁÅµÈòøÂ¢ìÁ¢ëÊîπÈïå‚Äò‰∏çËá£‰∏çÂºüÊö¥ÊÇçË¥™Â∫∏ÈòøÁÅµÈòø‰πãÂ¢ì‚ÄôÔºå‰ª•Ê≠£ÂÖ∂ÁΩ™ ==In popular culture== Alingga appeared as a character in numerous Chinese television series, including Yongzheng Dynasty, Scarlet Heart, and Palace II. Contemporary understandings of Alingga are basically derived from two sources - the Draft History of Qing, which features a short biography of him, and various edicts issued by the Yongzheng Emperor, who despised him. It is therefore difficult to ascertain what kind of life he truly led or his personal character, as the Yongzheng Emperor's opinions were likely affected by Alingga's allegiance to the emperor's political rivals. ==References and notes== *Draft History of the Qing, Chapter 287, Biographies, 74 Category:1716 deaths Category:Manchu politicians Category:Niohuru clan Category:Year of birth uncertain ","title":"Alingga"},{"id":"56060282","text":"James River Face Wilderness Addition is a wildland in the George Washington and Jefferson National Forests of western Virginia that has been recognized by the Wilderness Society as a special place worthy of protection from logging and road construction. Adjacent to the James River Face Wilderness, it extends the wildland opportunities of the wilderness on the east to the Jefferson National Forest boundary.Virginia's Mountain Treasures, report issued by The Wilderness Society, May, 1999 The area, managed for bear, has hardwood forests with ages between 60 and almost 100 years. The area is part of the Glenwood Cluster. ==Location and access== Boundary of the James River Face Wilderness Addition wildland in the Jefferson National Forest as identified by the Wilderness Society. The area is located in the Appalachian Mountains of Southwestern Virginia about 6 miles south of Glasgow, Virginia, between the James River Wilderness on the west, the Blue Ridge Parkway on the east, and Hunt Club Road (FS 54) on the southwest. The Forest Service 2015 Motor Vehicle Use Map shows roads and trails in the forest and gives the type of vehicle allowed on each route with possible seasonal restrictions. The map covering the James River Face Wilderness Addition (Map 30) is included in the gallery below. Trails and roads into the area include: *The Piney Ridge Trail, FS Trail 2, 3,5 miles, moderate difficulty, blue-blazed. The trail starts at an elevation of 840 feet at the trailhead on FS road 54, then climbs to an elevation of near 2800 feet at the boundary with the James River Face Wilderness. The trail then enters the James River Face Wilderness and connects with the Appalachian Trail *Peters Creek Spur, FS 54A *Other roads are shown on the Motor Vehicle Use Map in the gallery below. The boundary of the wildland as determined by the Wilderness Society is shown in the adjacent map. Additional roads and trails are given on National Geographic Map 789. A great variety of information, including topographic maps, aerial views, satellite data and weather information, is obtained by selecting the link with the wildland's coordinates in the upper right of this page. Beyond maintained trails, old logging roads can be used to explore the area. The Appalachian Mountains were extensively timbered in the early twentieth century leaving logging roads that are becoming overgrown but still passable., Old logging roads and railroad grades can be located by consulting the historical topographic maps available from the United States Geological Survey (USGS). The James River Face Wilderness Addition is covered by USGS topographic map Snowden. A key to the topographic maps for the northern half of the Jefferson National Forest is in the gallery below. ==Natural history== The habitat of the southern Appalachians is rich in its biological diversity with nearly 10,000 species, some not found anywhere else. The great diversity is related to the many ridges and valleys which form isolated communities in which species evolve separately from one another. The region lies south of the glaciers that covered North America 11,000 years go. To escape the glaciers, northern species retreated south to find refuge in the southern Appalachians. When the glaciers retreated, many of these species remained along with the southern species that were native to the area. The diversity includes trees, mosses, millipedes and salamanders. A small portion of the James River Gorge special biological area is included in this area. This portion contains the Kankakee globe mallow. Wild natural trout streams in Virginia are classified by the Department of Game and Inland Fisheries by their water quality, with class i the highest and class iv the lowest.Virginia Stream Classification: 9VAC25-260-370. Classification Column., accessdate: June 18, 2017 Peters Creek is ranked as a class ii trout stream. ==Forest Service management== The Forest Service has conducted a survey of their lands to determine the potential for wilderness designation. Wilderness designation provides a high degree of protection from development. The areas that were found suitable are referred to as inventoried roadless areas. Later a Roadless Rule was adopted that limited road construction in these areas. The rule provided some degree of protection by reducing the negative environmental impact of road construction and thus promoting the conservation of roadless areas. The northern 1,121 acres of this area has been inventoried in the roadless area review, and therefore protected from possible road construction and timber sales. A part of the wildland on the east is \\"designated utility corridor\\", the southern portion is designated \\"Ruffed Grouse Habitat\\",and the extreme southern tip is designated \\"Blue Ridge Parkway Corridor\\". The grouse habitat designation allows timber cutting and roadbuilding. ==Nearby Wildlands== Nearby wilderness areas and wildlands recognized as one of Virginia's \\"Mountain Treasures\\" by the Wilderness Society are: *James River Face Wilderness *Thunder Ridge Wilderness *White Oak Ridge-Terrapin Mountain *North Creek (conservation area) *Wilson Mountain *Cove Mountain ==References== Category:George Washington and Jefferson National Forests Category:Protected areas of Bedford County, Virginia ","title":"James River Face Wilderness Addition"},{"id":"56060285","text":"Lusaka Apex Medical University (LAMU), is a privately owned medical university in Zambia, established to address the shortage of qualified medical personnel in Zambia in particular, and Southern Africa in general. ==Location== The main campus of the university is located along the Lusaka-Kasama road, approximately , by road, south of the central business district of the city of Lusaka, Zambia's capital and largest city.

It resulted in the removal of incumbent Mayor Jane Murray from office. After legal and procedural efforts to halt the recall effort by Murray and her attorneys failed, a city-wide recall election was held on December 7. The results of the election were 1,978 in favor of the recall and 1,145 against. Voter turnout was 26 percent. Mayor Murray was succeeded by Portsmouth President of City Council David Malone on December 20. ==Background== Jane Murray won a municipal election for mayor in November 2009, and took office on January 4, 2010. On her first day in office, Murray terminated three city department heads (City Service Director Chris Murphy, Water Works Director Sam Sutherland, and Wastewater Director Rick Duncan). Explaining her actions, she stated, \\"I have seen the lack of judgment. I have seen there not being a real interest in driving forward with protecting people and their property.\\" Representatives of the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency notified the city that it was out of compliance with environmental regulations, since Murray's termination of the water works director and the wastewater director left the city without qualified personnel in those positions and that the city was subject to being fined. ==References== Category:2010 Ohio elections Portsmouth, Ohio Category:Portsmouth, Ohio Category:Recall elections in the United States ","title":"2010 Portsmouth, Ohio mayoral recall election"},{"id":"56060515","text":"Construction of the main building of the USCG Point Adams Station, in 1938. Coast Guard Station Point Adams was a United States Coast Guard base at the mouth of the Columbia River. It was founded in 1888, by the United States Lifesaving Service, one of the service that were amalgamated into the Coast Guard. The original boathouse, barracks, and outbuildings, were built to the Fort Point-type design. During the depression new buildings were built to a design named after then President Franklin Roosevelt. ==Equipment== The station's first boathouse held two surfboats, where most other station's boathouse held just a single boat. The boats were mounted on a wagon, which its crew would pull to the best place to launch. Wagons were pushed into the surf for launching. In the 1930s the base was the home of the Coast Guard's first USCGC Triumph, a motor lifeboat. This wooden-hulled vessel, and a single sister ship, were bigger than all other motor lifeboats. ==Operational history== On January 7, 1913, the USLS Dreadnaught, under the command of Stationkeeper, Oscar S. Wicklund, and the USLS Tenacious, braved breakers to cross the Columbia Bar to try to rescue survivors from the tanker Rosecrans. The rescued just two survivors, out of a crew of 36. The sea was so heavy both lifeboats capsized, and their waterlogged engines were rendered inoperable, forcing the crew to fall back on oars. Wicklund and Alfred Rimer, the Tenaciouss skipper, opted to row to the Columbia River Lightship. Their crew and survivors took refuge there, where the lifeboats were later swept away. ==Retirement== The Coast Guard closed the base, and transferred it to a local community college, in the 1960s. It was subsequently transferred to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which has employed it as a fishery research centre. Its location at the mouth of the largest river on the US West Coast makes it an ideal site for fishery research. ==References * Category:United States Coast Guard stations ","title":"Coast Guard Station Point Adams"},{"id":"56060520","text":"Panorama from first ascent of Baffin Island's Broad Peak in Canadian Arctic Stephen Trafton is a financial turnaround manager, land speed record holder, Arctic explorer and historian. In his position as the head of a major American bank, he also pursued a landmark breach-of-contract legal action against the U.S. Government. The suit asserted that the Federal Government is liable for damages due to a breach-of-contract on its part, even if that breach was caused by congressional action. This principle was upheld by the United States Supreme Court in a 7 to 2 ruling. == Career == In July 1990, during the Savings and Loan crisis, Stephen Trafton was hired by the nation's fifth largest S&L;, Glendale Federal Bank, to devise a plan to save it from seizure by federal bank regulators. In March 1992, he was named Chairman, CEO and President of the bank and its holding company, Glenfed. Trafton then instigated and led one of the largest private (non government assisted) recapitalization and restructurings of a troubled financial institution in U.S. history. This action was credited with saving American taxpayers $4 - $5 billion, if it had been seized and liquidated by the federal Resolution Trust Corporation (RTC). thumb Mount Fairweather 1977 During his tenure,Trafton also oversaw a major breach-of-contract lawsuit against the Federal Government involving the passage and implementation of certain provisions of the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989 (FIRREA). Despite the government's arguments to the contrary, including the assertion that Trafton and Glendale were simply trying to defraud the Federal Government, the United States Supreme Court sided with Glendale. The court affirmed the principle that the U.S. Government cannot breach contracts with impunity. As a result, Glendale was initially awarded $908.9 million by the Court of Federal Claims. This was one of the largest ever judgments against the U.S.Government and helped to label Trafton as a turnaround specialist. Trafton's successful court-case against the Federal Government was profiled in the Los Angeles Business Journal, Fortune Magazine, Business Week, The American Banker, Forbes, The Los Angeles Times, The New York Times, and The Seattle Times.thumb First Assent of DeHaven Peak at 80¬∞ N Trafton is also cited as an Arctic explorer, historical researcher, driver of the world's fastest Ferrari, author, and adventurer. == Other Activities == Found Lieut.

Coached by her father Tony, she was only 14 when she began competing in local ITF circuit tournaments. In 2004, she had her breakthrough year when she won three $10,000 events in the space of a month, at Guayaquil, La Paz and Asuncion. Her biggest tournament win was a $25,000 tournament in San Luis Potosi in 2006. She featured in a WTA Tour main draw for the first time at the 2007 Copa Colsanitas (Bogota), in the women's doubles with Larissa Carvalho. They were defeated in the first round by Flavia Pennetta and Roberta Vinci. Straight after that event, she travelled to Acapulco and made the main singles draw of the Abierto Mexicano Telcel WTA tournament, as a lucky loser from qualifying, where she was beaten again in the opening round, by sixth seed Gisela Dulko. She played in the singles qualifying draws for the 2007 French Open, Wimbledon Championships and US Open Grand Slam events, as well as competing for Brazil at the Pan American Games in Rio de Janeiro. Despite ending 2007 at a career best of No. 186 in the world, she decided to retire from professional tennis. Over the next few years she instead attended college in the United States and played collegiate tennis for the Pacific Tigers in Stockton, California. She represented Brazil in a total of ten Fed Cup ties for a 6/4 overall record, with all six wins coming in singles. ==ITF finals== {  style=\\"font-size:85%;\\" width=15% - style=\\"background:lightblue;\\"  $25,000 tournaments - bgcolor=\\"#f0f8ff\\"  $10,000 tournaments } ===Singles (5‚Äì5)=== {class=\\"sortable \\" style=font-size:97% - !

Similarly to her previous single, \\"Kuchibiru Kara Biyaku\\", a limited number of 7-inch vinyls of the single were produced for promotional use. \\"Senry≈´ no Shizuku\\" has never appeared on an original album, but was included in the compilation album Unlimited (1990). ==Background== The song was written by Shizuka Kudo, under the pseudonym , composed by Tsugutoshi Got≈ç and arranged by Draw4. Kudo revealed the origin of her pseudonym when she was interviewed as a guest on the Fuji TV music show TK Music Clamp, stating that Aeri is what her mother had considered naming her and she had felt it fitting to use it as her lyricist pseudonym. Lyrically, \\"Senry≈´ no Shizuku\\" deals with the theme of forbidden love. The track was praised for its \\"modern and chic\\" melody and \\"delicate\\" lyrics. Music critics also noted the influence of Miyuki Nakajima's work on Kudo's first forray into songwriting. ==Cover version== In 2014, Tomomi Kahara recorded a cover of the song for her album Memories: Kahara Covers. While promoting the album, Kahara performed the song in duet with Kudo on the music show Music Fair. ==Chart performance== \\"Senry≈´ no Shizuku\\" debuted at number-one on the Oricon Singles Chart, selling 100,000 units in its first week and becoming her seventh consecutive number-one.

TLQP-62 is derived from VGF precursor protein via proteolytic cleavage by prohormone convertases PC1/3 at the RPR555 site. TLQP-62 is named after its first four N-terminal amino acids and its peptide length. == Function == Although the receptor(s) for TLQP-62 has not been identified so far, extensive studies have demonstrated that it acts on central nervous system, peripheral nervous system and endocrine tissue to exert its biological functions. === Synaptic plasticity === Acute TLQP-62 treatment rapidly increases synaptic activity in hippocampal neurons, and potentiates CA1 field excitatory postsynaptic potential fEPSP in the hippocampal slices, thus facilitating hippocampal synaptic transmission.

It is now a hotel which provides accommodation and restaurant services. ==Early history== John Waddingham with his two grandchildren in about 1860. Cotswold Grange was erected in about 1840 and one of its earliest residents was John Waddingham (1799-1890), a wealthy merchant and landed proprietor. He is shown to be living there from about 1848 until 1862.

This was a passenger ship sunk by a German submarine torpedo shortly before the outbreak of the War. A newspaper report tells of Jessie‚Äôs anxious 24 hour ordeal while she waited for news of her niece. Fortunately she received a phone call early in the morning informing her that they were safe and had been brought in with other survivors to Glasgow.Gloucestershire Echo - Tuesday 05 September 1939, p. 1.

It is not only a sweet, as it is also used as main ingredient of many other sweets. In North India, Kheer (Payesam) is a type of rice pudding. But in Bengal, in the same spelling and sound, Kheer is a completely different dish. It is very similar to the Khoa but with its own distinct flavour and texture. ==Preparation== To prepare Kheer (evaporated milk), cow or buffalo milk is the only ingredient. Pure milk is boiled over an hour to make one-third of its original volume. This is Kheer. Sometimes to make a more sweet and different taste sugar, Arrowroot, Suji are mixed with it during boiling, but the taste of the unadulterated version is very different and tastes more authentic. To make Khoa, the boiling process is extended to reduce the original volume to a fourth or fifth. Khoa is harder than Kheer. This hardness makes a difference to the taste, and is the difference Khoa (milk solids) and Kheer (evaporated milk). ==Uses== As in Bengal kheer is one of the most important ingredients for making sweets, it has a high demand in the market. In terms of hardness, it can be categorised in two forms: * Khoa ‚Äì hard kheer * Kheer ‚Äì semi-liquid kheer Khoa is used to make some Bengali sweets like kansat. Kheer is used for Rosmalai like sweets, where small balls of channa are immersed in kheer. ==Some related sweets== * Kheerkadam (‡¶ï‡ßç‡¶∑‡ßÄ‡¶∞‡¶ï‡¶¶‡¶Æ) * Kansat (‡¶ï‡¶æ‡¶®‡¶∏‡¶æ‡¶ü) * Kheer er borfi (‡¶ï‡ßç‡¶∑‡ßÄ‡¶∞‡ßá‡¶∞ ‡¶¨‡¶∞‡¶´‡¶ø) * Pat kheer (‡¶™‡¶æ‡¶§‡¶ï‡ßç‡¶∑‡ßÄ‡¶∞) ==Kheer in literature== Abanindranath Tagore wrote a story of two Queens of a King, titled as Kheer er putul, means a doll made with kheer. In this story, one queen made her virtual son with Kheer and sent for marriage. Somehow Shathi Thakur (a Goddess) ate it but captured as she stole this doll and in reply, she gave a son to that queen. ==In idioms== There is a Bengali idioms circulated in Bengal i.e. Means if you keep your patience in your work then you must see the success, as after devoting over an hour to boil milk to make delicious kheer.

In the season opener, Idaho defeated Gonzaga then played a scoreless tie with Montana in the mud in the MacLean Field debut. After two consecutive wins in the series, Idaho lost to Washington State in the Battle of the Palouse, falling at Rogers Field in Pullman. The weather was ideal but the only score was a drop-kick field goal in the second quarter. Nine years later, the Vandals won the first of three consecutive, their only three-peat in the rivalry series. Idaho tallied a mere twelve points in its six games. In the opener, they scored on a field goal and a safety on a punt then went scoreless in the next four games. The sole Idaho touchdown came in the final game on a forward pass for the game's only score. It was Griffith's final year as head coach; he left for Oklahoma A&M; (now Oklahoma State) in Stillwater. ==Schedule== * The Little Brown Stein trophy for the Montana game debuted 24 years later in 1938 * One game was played on Thursday (against Whitman at Walla Walla on Thanksgiving) ==References *Gem of the Mountains: 1916 University of Idaho yearbook (spring 1915) ‚Äì 1914 football season *Go Mighty Vandals ‚Äì 1914 football season *Idaho Argonaut ‚Äì student newspaper ‚Äì 1914 editions Idaho Category:Idaho Vandals football seasons Idaho football ","title":"1914 Idaho football team"},{"id":"56060960","text":"} This is a list of electoral district results of the 2001 Western Australian election. == Results by Electoral district  Albany = Alfred Cove = Armadale = Avon = Ballajura = Bassendean = Belmont = Bunbury = Burrup = Carine = Churchlands = Cockburn = Collie = Cottesloe = Darling Range = Dawesville = Eyre = Fremantle = Geraldton = Girrawheen = Greenough = Hillarys = Innaloo = Joondalup = Kalgoorlie = Kimberley = Kingsley = Mandurah = Maylands = Merredin = Midland = Mitchell = Moore = Murdoch = Murray-Wellington = Nedlands = Ningaloo = Nollamara === } === Peel = Perth = Pilbara = Riverton = Rockingham = Roe = Roleystone = South Perth = Southern River = Stirling = Swan Hills = Thornlie = Vasse = Victoria Park = Wagin = Wanneroo = Warren- Blackwood = Willagee = Yokine = See also == * Results of the Western Australian state election, 2001 (Legislative Council) * 2001 Western Australian state election * Candidates of the Western Australian state election, 2001 * Members of the Western Australian Legislative Assembly, 2001‚Äì2005 == References == Category:Results of Western Australian elections Category:2001 elections in Australia ","title":"Results of the 2001 Western Australian state election (Legislative Assembly)"},{"id":"56060968","text":"Fazal Elahi () is a Pakistani politician hailing from Peshawar District, who served as a member in the 10th Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Assembly, belonging to the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf.

An anonymous former employee for Definers called NTK Network its \\"in-house fake news shop\\". ==Contract with Environmental Protection Agency== In December 2017, Definers Public Affairs was paid $120,000 in a no-bid contract from the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for services which included searching for \\"resistance figures\\" opposing the agenda of Administrator Scott Pruitt, appointed to head the agency under President Donald Trump. During the bid Definers listed itself erroneously as a \\"small disadvantaged business\\", which was corrected after receiving the contract. Allan Blutstein a lawyer for Definers Public Affairs lodged FOI requests on low-level bureaucrats that were perceived to be hostile to Pruitt's agenda, Definers work was incorrectly listed as in the contract to perform ‚Äúmedia monitoring‚Äù services. Definers cancelled the contract after receiving media scrutiny. William K. Reilly, the EPA administrator under President George H.W. Bush, criticized the hiring of Definers Public Affairs, saying that: \\"Mr. Pruitt appears not to understand that the two most valuable assets EPA has is the country‚Äôs trust and a very committed professional work force. This shows complete insensitivity, complete tone-deafness, or something worse.\\" John O‚ÄôGrady, President of the American Federation of Government Employees Council 238, which represents approximately 10,000 EPA employees, was the target of a Definers FOIA request, and called the firm a threat to EPA employees. Charles Tiefer of the University of Baltimore argued that Definers is benefiting from politically-motivated crony capitalism. ==Allegations by Shervin Pishevar== In November 2017 Venture capitalist Shervin Pishevar filed a lawsuit against Definers Public Affairs, alleging that it orchestrated a smear campaign against him. == Contract with Facebook == In October 2017, Facebook expanded its work with Definers Public Affairs, that had originally been hired to monitor press coverage of the company to address concerns primarily regarding Russian meddling, then mishandling of user data by Cambridge Analytica, hate speech on Facebook, and calls for regulation. Definers had established a Silicon Valley outpost earlier that year led by Tim Miller, a former spokesman for Jeb Bush. For tech firms, he argued in one interview, a goal should be to \\"have positive content pushed out about your company and negative content that‚Äôs being pushed out about your competitor.\\" Elliot Schrage, Facebook's Head of Communications and Policy stated in a blog post, that he asked Definers Public Affairs to open a file on Soros after the philanthropist called Facebook \\"a menace to society\\" in a speech earlier this year. A research document circulated by Definers to reporters this summer, just a month after the House hearing, linked George Soros, a frequent subject of antisemitic conspiracy theories, to critics of Facebook. Following the public outcry from the New York Times article on the activity of Definers Public Affairs, Facebook cut ties with the agency. George Soros' Open Society Foundation put a statement out that said the content was a \\"deliberate strategy to distract\\" from Facebook's own scandals and that the \\"methods threaten the very values underpinning our democracy.\\" Tim Miller defended the accuracy of Definers' work stating that \\"Definers shared a narrow document about an anti-Facebook group's funding. It was entirely factual.\\" BuzzFeed News published some of Definers' research on Soros. ==References * Category:Opposition research Category:Competitive intelligence Category:Privately held companies based in Virginia Category:Companies based in Arlington County, Virginia Category:2016 establishments in Virginia Category:American companies established in 2016 ","title":"Definers Public Affairs"},{"id":"56061438","text":"Andrzej Stanis≈Çaw Julian Dunajewski (in German literature known as Andreas Dunajewski) (August 3, 1908, Wola Justowska - August 1944 ) was a Polish zoologist and ornithologist.

Its route connects four districts of Odisha: Cuttack, Dhenkanal, Angul and Sambalpur. It connects the Mahanadi Coalfields in Talcher and Nalco in Angul to Howrah‚ÄìChennai main line in the east and Jharsuguda‚ÄìVizianagaram line in the west. It also connects Mahanadi Coalfields in Western Odisha to Talcher. ==History== In 1922, a railway line was built from Talcher to Nergundi to connect the coalfields in Talcher to the Howrah-Chennai main line. But since there was a needto connect the coalfields of Western Odisha to Eastern Odisha, the Talcher‚ÄìSambalpur railway project was commissioned in 1983 and the work began in 1987. It was completed in 1996 and became operational in 1998. The flagging off of the Tapaswini Express, the first passenger train of the section by the Hon'ble Minister of Railways, fulfilled the long cherished dream of the people of Odisha to have a cultural, emotional, and socio- economic integration of the eastern and western parts of the State. This rail link, apart from relieving congestion of the Howrah‚ÄìMumbai and Howrah‚ÄìChennai trunk routes, reduced the distance between Cuttack, Bhubaneswar, and Puri, respectively the commercial, political, and cultural capitals of Odisha, to important Indian cities of Western and Northern India such as Mumbai, New Delhi, etc. by 380 km. ==Electrification and doubling== The track doubling and the electrification of the Nergundi‚ÄìTalcher section were completed in 2015. The Angul‚ÄìSambalpur section electrification was completed in 2018. The track doubling work of Angul-Boinda and Rairakhol-Sambalpur sections are under progress. The tentative date of its completion is set to 2020. https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/pm-modi-unveils- slew-of-projects-worth-over-rs-1550-cr-in-odisha/articleshow/67537519.cms ==NALCO and NTPC links== This railway line connects NALCO and NTPC plants in Angul to rest of the country. The plant receives coal from the Lingaraj coal mine of MCL through a MGR Railway transportation system covering a distance of 39 km. ==Coalfield links== Talcher Coalfield with reserves of 38.65 billion tonnes, the largest in India, is located on the Cuttack‚ÄìSambalpur line. This railway line connects the MCL coalfields of Brajrajnagar and Talcher in western and eastern Odisha respectively. ==Speed limits== The Cuttack‚ÄìSambalpur line is classified as a \\"Group D Spl\\" line which can take speeds up to 100 km/h. This section already carries high traffic density and is likely to grow substantially in future with the completion of doubling work. The sanctioned speed limit for this line is 100 km/h. ==Passenger movement== Cuttack, Dhenkanal, Angul, Talcher road and Sambalpur are the busiest railway stations in this section. ==References== Category:5 ft 6 in gauge railways in India Category:Rail transport in Odisha Category:Railway lines opened in 1998 Category:Transport in Cuttack Category:Transport in Sambalpur ","title":"Cuttack‚ÄìSambalpur line"},{"id":"56061613","text":"Gohar Ali Shah is a Pakistani politician hailing from Mardan District, who is currently a member of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Assembly, belonging to the Awami National Party.

During the first eight months of his presidency, he nominated approximately 50 judges, a significantly higher number than any other recent president had made by that point in his presidency. By June 24, 2020, 200 of his Article III nominees had been confirmed by the United States Senate. , the American Bar Association (ABA) had rated 220 of Trump's nominees. Of these nominees, 150 were rated \\"well-qualified,\\" 61 were rated \\"qualified,\\" and 9 were rated \\"not qualified.\\" Seven of the nine individuals rated as \\"not qualified\\" have been confirmed by the Senate. As of July 2020, the judges appointed by Trump are \\"85% white and 76% male; less than 5% are black,‚Äù as a result of which the federal judiciary has become \\"less diverse\\" compared to previous administrations, according to an analysis by The Conversation. This phenomenon is even more pronounced when more narrowly considering Trump's appointees to the Court of Appeals; as of October 2020, none of the 50 judges appointed by Trump to the court of appeals are black. ==Supreme CourtConfirmed nominees=== Supreme Court of the United States *Neil Gorsuch (of Colorado): Trump announced the nomination of Judge Gorsuch on January 31, 2017. The nomination was formally transmitted to the Senate on February 1, 2017. Judge Gorsuch's confirmation hearings started on March 20, 2017, and lasted four days. On April 3, the Judiciary Committee approved Judge Gorsuch by a vote of 11‚Äì9, a party-line vote. During the last day of committee hearings, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) announced from the Senate floor that he would filibuster the nomination. Democratic opposition focused primarily on the complaint that the vacancy on the court was created by the death of Justice Antonin Scalia during President Barack Obama's administration should have been filled by President Obama's nominee for the vacancy, Judge Merrick Garland. In response, Republicans hearkened back to November 2013 when Democrats invoked the nuclear option to fill three vacancies on the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. To counter the filibuster, Republicans invoked the nuclear option, ending debate with a simple majority vote and extending the rule that a simple majority could invoke cloture on all presidential nominations, including Supreme Court nominations. The Senate confirmed Gorsuch on April 7, 2017, by a vote of 54‚Äì45, with all Senate Republicans present voting to confirm along with three Democratic Senators from states that voted heavily for Trump: Senators Joe Manchin (D-WV), Heidi Heitkamp (D-ND), and Joe Donnelly (D-IN). *Brett Kavanaugh (of Maryland): Trump announced the nomination of Judge Kavanaugh in July 2018. The nomination was formally transmitted to the Senate on July 10, 2018. The Senate confirmed Judge Kavanaugh on October 6, 2018, by a vote of 50‚Äì48. Except for Senator Lisa Murkowski (R-AK), all Senate Republicans voted to confirm Judge Kavanaugh and except for Senator Joe Manchin (D-WV), all Senate Democrats opposed him. Murkowski announced her opposition to Judge Kavanaugh, but instead of voting no, she voted present in order to pair her vote with Senator Steve Daines (R-MT), who was attending his daughter's wedding. ==Appellate nomineesFailed nominees=== United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit *Halil Suleyman Ozerden (of Mississippi): On June 11, 2019, Trump announced his intent to nominate Ozerden to serve as a United States Circuit Judge for the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.\\"President Donald J. Trump Announces Judicial Nominees\\" White House, June 11, 2019 On June 24, 2019, his nomination was sent to the Senate. His nomination ran into opposition from some conservative groups and he faced skeptical questions from several Republican Senators on the Senate Judiciary Committee. Many of the questions regard his views on religious liberty and some others questioned how many of his rulings had been reversed. On September 12, 2019, Senator Ted Cruz announced his opposition to the nomination. The Judiciary Committee was scheduled to vote on recommending Ozerden on September 26, 2019, but the vote was postponed after Senator Josh Hawley joined Ted Cruz in his opposition to Ozerden's elevation to the Circuit Court. On January 3, 2020, his nomination was returned to the President under Rule XXXI, Paragraph 6 of the Senate. Trump later nominated Cory T. Wilson in Ozerden's place, and Wilson was confirmed on June 24, 2020. United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit *Ryan Bounds (of Oregon): On September 7, 2017, Trump nominated Bounds, a former Assistant U.S. Attorney, to serve as a United States Circuit Judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, to the seat vacated by Judge Diarmuid O'Scannlain, who assumed senior status on December 31, 2016. A short time later, the state's two Democratic U.S. Senators, Ron Wyden and Jeff Merkley, announced that they would blue slip the nomination. They complained that the Trump administration had bypassed a state bipartisan vetting commission and had not consulted them about the nomination. However, the White House Counsel's office produced records stating that they had contacted the state's U.S. Senators on multiple occasions, but had gotten little response from them. On January 3, 2018, his nomination was returned to the President under Rule XXXI, Paragraph 6 of the Senate. On January 5, 2018, Trump announced his intent to renominate Bounds to a federal judgeship. On January 8, 2018, his renomination was sent to the Senate. In February 2018, the bipartisan committee cited by the two Senators found Bounds to be qualified.http://media.oregonlive.com/portland_impact/other/Signed%20Judicial%20Candidates%20Letter.pdf However, the Senators subsequently questioned Bounds' fitness on the basis of some of his writings when he was a student at Stanford University in the 1990s. On May 9, 2018, a hearing on his nomination was held before the Senate Judiciary Committee.United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary: Nominations for May 9, 2018 On June 7, 2018, his nomination was reported out of committee by an 11‚Äì10 party-line vote.Results of Executive Business Meeting ‚Äì June 7, 2018, Senate Judiciary Committee On July 18, 2018, the Senate voted 50‚Äì49 to invoke cloture on his nomination. On July 19, 2018, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell announced that Bounds' nomination would be withdrawn after Senators Tim Scott and Marco Rubio announced they would not support the nomination, meaning there would not be enough votes to confirm Bounds.

The ABA added that \\"'There was a theme that the nominee lacks humility, has an 'entitlement' temperament, does not have an open mind, and does not always have a commitment to being candid and truthful'\\". The ABA also raised \\"concerns about whether Mr. VanDyke would be fair to persons who are gay, lesbian, or otherwise part of the LGBTQ community, adding that \\"Mr. VanDyke would not say affirmatively that he would be fair to any litigant before him, notably members of the LGBTQ community.\\" On October 30, 2019, a hearing on VanDyke's nomination was held before the Senate Judiciary Committee. Most of the two-hour hearing was focused on VanDyke's record on LGBTQ issues.

I do not believe that. It is a fundamental belief of mine that all people are created in the image of God and they should all be treated with dignity and respect'\\".

VanDyke stated that his views had changed since that time. VanDyke said that during a three-hour meeting with the ABA, the ABA evaluator told him that she was in a \\"hurry\\" and did not give him the opportunity to fully respond to concerns.

Bogren: On March 8, 2019, Trump agreed to nominate Borgen as a Federal Trial Judge at the urging of U.S. Senators Debbie Stabenow and Gary Peters. However, his nomination drew criticism from Republicans and conservatives. A particular point of contention was when Bogren represented the city of East Lansing, which barred two married Christian farmers from selling his goods at the local farmers' market because after they refused to a host a same-sex marriage on their farm citing religious beliefs. While making his case, Bogren equated the farmers to the Ku Klux Klan and radical Muslims who oppose letting women drive. While Bogren claimed he was merely defending his client, his critics said his remarks went far beyond the bounds of fair comment and showed anti-Christian bias, thus proving that he did not have the temperament to judge cases impartially. On June 11, 2019, Bogren withdrew his nomination. The White House formally sent a notice of the withdrawal of Bogren's nomination to the Senate on June 26, 2019. Trump later nominated Hala Y.

The music video was directed by Giacomo Triglia and was released on 20 November 2017. It was filmed at Cretto di Burri. Lyrically, the song speaks of the difficulty of communicating, the difference between feeling and listening and the desire to embrace, not to be afraid of showing that side of feeling that is pure tenderness. The song spent 18 weeks on the Italian singles chart, peaking at number 15, and was certified Platinum for sales exceeding 50,000 copies. On 4 December 2017, the album's cover and title were announced. The track listing was announced on 20 December 2017 through Michielin's social network accounts. On 22 December 2017, the album was made available for pre-order, and the track \\"Tropicale\\" was released as a pre-order bonus and on streaming platforms. On 16 March 2018, Michielin announced that \\"Bolivia\\" would be released as the album's third single. The music video was released on 20 March 2018. It was directed by Giacomo Triglia and the screenplay was written by Francesca Michielin. In an interview with Rolling Stone, Michielin said that the song is a criticism of people who chase change and run away to exotic and remote places with the idea of living a more genuine life and making a difference, without realising that often the problem to be solved is within them. \\"Tropicale\\" was released as the fourth single on 15 June 2018, along with a music video. On 16 November 2018, Michielin released the single \\"Femme\\". The song has a feminist message, describing the negative situations that women accept unconsciously. It was remixed by Bruno Belissimo. The single preceded the release of 2640 on vinyl on 7 December 2018. The vinyl edition also included a demo version of \\"Tropicale\\" and Carl Brave's single \\"Fotografia\\", on which Michielin and Fabri Fibra featured. \\"Fotografia\\" had considerable success in Italy, peaking at number 6 and achieving a certification of 3x Platinum for sales exceeding 150,000 copies. ==Track listingPersonnel== Credits adapted from AllMusicItalia.it.

Like most of his work it follows the development of unexplained events in a small Arizona town, in this case revolving around a demonic mailman. ==Synopsis== English teacher Doug Albin, his wife Tritia and their son Billy live in the small town of Willis, Arizona, and are shocked to learn of the suicide of their friendly, beloved, and seemingly content long- term mail carrier. A replacement arrives by the name of John Smith, an evasive and vaguely threatening man with pale skin and flame-red hair. When disturbances in the delivery of letters begin to occur, Doug comes to suspect that the strange new mailman is up to something sinister, an idea bolstered as people in town start receiving increasingly disturbing hate mail. ==Themes== Although the mailman is ultimately responsible for numerous violent acts that occur in the town of the story, he doesn't commit any of them himself, instead launching psychological assaults on the people he delivers mail to, so that their sanity breaks and they are driven to sickening acts of homicide, rape, torture, and even mass murder. In this way he exposes the weak veneer of civilisation, being able to make savages of ordinary people just by the letters that appear in their mailbox, purporting to be from friends and family members, destroying their faith in the outside world. For instance, he makes one believe that his younger brother, who died in the Vietnam war, sent him letters revealing himself to be a jaded psychopath who raped and murdered native girls. The exact nature of the mailman and his motivations are never fully explained, though he is clearly a sadistic demonic entity that finds expression through the US Postal Service. It's occasionally suggested that he has no motive at all, beyond maybe his own amusement. ==References== Category:1991 American novels Category:Horror novels Category:Novels set in Arizona ","title":"The Mailman (novel)"},{"id":"56061948","text":"Palleturi Chinnodu () is a 1974 Indian Telugu-language drama film, produced and directed by B.

In graph theory, a Xuong tree is a spanning tree T of a given graph G with the property that, in the remaining graph G-T, the number of connected components with an odd number of edges is as small as possible. They are named after Nguyen Huy Xuong, who used them to characterize the cellular embeddings of a given graph having the largest possible genus.

He learned a letter from a village clerk and became an avid book reader. In 1898, he achieved the opening of a library in the village - the first rural public library in the Ryazan province. In 1900, he was the first in the province to start selling books in the countryside. He became a member of the Constitutional Democratic Party (Cadets) at the time of its foundation. From this party, he was elected deputy of the State Duma of the Russian Empire of the second convocation, and it was he who was entrusted with the first of the cadets to speak at the first plenary meeting of the duma of this convocation. His speech was devoted to amnesty. Smagin‚Äôs public and elective activity was not limited to deputy in the Second Duma, he was constantly elected as a vowel of the Zaraysk district zemstvo assembly, and his zemstvo activity ceased only when the Bolsheviks came to power. n November 1918, mass peasant protests against the Bolsheviks took place throughout the Ryazan province. In Grigoryevsky, the youngest son of Smagin, Ivan, the ensign of the tsarist army, was chosen as the military leader of the uprising. After the suppression of unrest, Ivan fled, and A. Z. Smagin himself was arrested in his place and placed under the name of his son in a Zaraisk prison, where he spent about two months. He was arrested a second time and also briefly in January 1920. In the fall of 1929, the peasants of Grigoryevsky at rural gatherings refused the contracts for the supply of grain proposed by the district authorities and halved their self-imposed plans. This was seen as the machinations of enemies and counter-revolutionary agitation, the OGPU arrested 9 people, among whom were Smagin with his son Mikhail and priest V. I. Tumin. Smagin ended up in the Solovetsky counterattack camp, where he died no later than April 7, 1933. The place and circumstances of death are unknown. == Literature == * Bojovic M.

She was at her best as a two-year-old in 1983 when she won both the Anglesey Stakes and the Moyglare Stud Stakes as well as finishing third in the Phoenix Stakes and fourth in the Cheveley Park Stakes. At the end of the year she was rated the best Irish filly of her generation. After running uplaced in her only appearance of 1984 she was exported to the United States where she won once from nine starts. ==Background== Gala Event was a \\"quite attractive, rather leggy\\" bay mare with a small white star bred in Ireland by Mrs A W F Whitehead. As a yearling the filly was put up for auction and sold for 25,000 guineas. She entered the ownership of F N Groves and was sent into training in with Ted Curtin near Naas in County Kildare. She was from the eighth crop of foals sired by Sallust an outstanding miler who won the Sussex Stakes and the Prix du Moulin in 1972. As a breeding stallion, the best of Sallust's progeny included Sanedtki and Tap On Wood. Gala Event's dam Rosemarin was a useful racehorse who won five races in Ireland at the ages of three and four. She was a granddaughter of Rose Bay Willow, who was a half-sister to both Cavan and Indiana. ==Racing career1983: two-year-old season=== Gala Event began her racing career with a win over six furlongs on good to firm ground at Navan Racecourse in June. Later that month, over the same course and distance, faced eight rivals in the valuable Woodford Stakes and reportedly \\"cantered\\" to victory by three lengths. In August the filly was stepped up in class to contest the Group 1 Phoenix Stakes at Phoenix Park Racecourse and was made the 2/1 favourite. After disputing the lead for most of the way she was overtaken in the final strides and finished third behind the colt King Persian and the filly Grey Dream. It was reported that she had lost a shoe during the race. A week after her defeat in the Phoenix, she started odds-on favourite for the Group 3 Anglesey Stakes at the Curragh and won \\"comfortably\\" by one and half lengths from Late Sally after taking the lead soon after the start. On 10 September Gala Event was one of twenty juvenile fillies to contest the Moyglare Stud Stakes over six furlongs at the Curragh and was made the 9/2 second favourite behind the British-trained Desirable (winner of the Princess Margaret Stakes). The other fancied runners included Ballet de France, Ispahan, Shindella (third in the Windsor Castle Stakes) and Bold Meadows. Ridden by Kevin Moses she tracked the front-running Welsh Woman before taking the lead on the outside approaching the final furlong. She held off the challenge of Deirable to win by three quarters of a length with Welsh Woman hanging on to take third place. On her final race the season the filly was sent to England for the Cheveley Park Stakes at Newmarket Racecourse. Ted Curtin had sent out Gentle Thoughts to take the race in 1973 but had not trained a winner in Britain since. Starting the 6/1 second favourite she was in contention for most of the way before being outpaced in the closing stages and finished fourth behind Desirable, Pebbles and the favourite Prickle, beaten just over a length by the winner. In the official Irish Free Handicap for the two-year-olds of 1983, Gala Event the rated the best filly, albeit fourteen pounds inferior to the top colt El Gran Senor. The independent Timeform organisation gave her a rating of 112, nine pounds behind the French- trained Treizieme who was their best juvenile filly of the season. ===1984: three-year-old season=== Gala Event missed most of her second season through injury and made only one appearance on the racecourse. In September she contested the Barronstown Stud Stakes over seven furlongs at Phoenix Park in which she finished sixth of the eight runners in a race won by the three-year- old colt Red Russell. At the end of the season she was given a rating of 98 by Timeform. ===1985 & 1986: North American racing career=== For the 1985 season, Gala Event was transferred to the United States where she was trained by John Sullivan in California. She made a successful North American debut when she won the Splendid Girl Stakes at Hollywood Park Racetrack on 22 June. She failed to win again that year, with the best of her six subsequent efforts coming when she finished third to Capichi in the Grade II Palomar Handicap. Gala Event remained in training as a five-year-old but after being beaten in two allowance races at Santa Anita Park in January she did not run again. ==Breeding record== Gala Event had no recorded foals and may have died shortly after her retirement from racing. ==PedigreeReferences== Category:1981 racehorse births Category:Racehorses bred in Ireland Category:Racehorses trained in Ireland Category:Racehorses trained in the United States Category:Thoroughbred family 2-e ","title":"Gala Event"},{"id":"56062427","text":"Daniel \\"Danny\\" Roman (born May 10, 1990) is an American professional boxer.

The list included former head of state Olusegun Obasanjo, his deputy Shehu Musa Yar'Adua, among others. During the trial of the coup plotters, TheNews, one of Nigeria's prominent investigative and combative news magazines published a story titled \\"Not Guilty - Army Panel Clears Coup Suspects.\\" And though he was no longer the editor of the paper as he was earlier in the year, because his name appeared on the mast head, Ajibade was targeted for arrest. He was charged for 'publishing materials which could obstruct the work of the coup plotters tribunal' and for 'misleading the public'. The crime was being \\"'as an accessary after the fact of treason\\" and the punishment was life in prison. It was the first time journalists would be tried (and convicted) with coup plotters in the country. Other journalists arrested at the same time were George Mbah of Tell Magazine, Chris Anyanwu of The Sunday Magazine, and Ben Obi of the Weekend Classique. They were all convicted and sentenced to life in jail, while Yar'adua was sentenced to death. Ajibade was taken to Makurdi prisons, according to him, \\"to die incrementally\\". There was international outcry and the sentence for Ajibade was reduced to 15 years. On 8 June 1998, General Abacha died in office.

Finally, the film has been handed back to the film unit after some serious warnings from the censor board. The film received negative reviews from critics. Malathi Rangarajan of The Hindu wrote, \\"The actual plot unfolds in the last 40 minutes, but by that time you are tired with the gibberish that has been going on for more than an hour\\". Sify stated, \\"The problem with the film is the stale story that we have seen in umpteen youth films\\" and criticized the excessive vulgarity. ==References== Category:2004 films Category:Indian films Category:Tamil-language films Category:2000s Tamil-language films Category:Indian teen films Category:Indian coming-of-age films Category:Indian thriller films Category:Films featuring an item number Category:2004 thriller films ","title":"Vayasu Pasanga"},{"id":"56062752","text":"The 1987 GP Ouest-France was the 51st edition of the GP Ouest-France cycle race and was held on 25 August 1987.

She is an expert on the Middle East and was a lecturer before assuming the government position she was offered by Chancellor Sebastian Kurz. ==Life and career== Born in Vienna, Kneissl spent parts of her childhood in Amman, where her father worked as a pilot for King Hussein of Jordan and also was involved in the development of Royal Jordanian Airlines. As a 17-year-old high school student she wrote a worried letter about the civil war to Lebanese President Amin Gemayel. Gemayel replied to her letter. In her youth and student days Kneissl also was active in Amnesty International and supported environmental and human rights organizations worldwide. Kneissl studied law and oriental languages at the University of Vienna between 1983 and 1987. After graduating, she studied International relations at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and the University of Jordan in Amman. Subsequently, she spent a year as a Fulbright fellow at the Center for Contemporary Arab Studies at Georgetown University. In 1992 she graduated from the √âcole nationale d'administration. She earned a PhD in international law with a dissertation on the Notion of borders of the belligerent parties of the Middle East. In 1990 she joined Austria's Foreign Office. From 1990 to 1998 she worked in the cabinet of √ñVP foreign minister Alois Mock, in the International Law Office, and was posted abroad in Paris and Madrid. She left the diplomatic service in the fall of 1998, and has since lived in Seibersdorf near Vienna, where she was active between 2005 and 2010 as an independent local councilor on the list of √ñVP.√ºber mich, Webseite von Karin Kneissl, abgerufen am 10. Dezember 2017 Kneissl has since worked as a freelance journalist for German and English- language print media. She became known to the public through her political analyses in the Austrian Broadcasting Corporation, and she has authored several specialized and non-fiction books. As an expert in international law, history of the Middle East and the energy market, Kneissl teaches at the Diplomatic Academy of Vienna, the European Business School in Rheingau and is a guest lecturer at the National Defense Academy, the Military Academy in Wiener Neustadt and at universities in Lebanon, among them the francophone Universit√© Saint-Joseph in Beirut. For ten years, she worked at the Department of Political Science at the University of Vienna. Among other things, she also writes as an independent correspondent for the daily newspapers Die Presse and Neue Z√ºrcher Zeitung and RT website. Kneissl is Vice President of the Austrian Society for Political-Military Studies STRATEG. From 2011 to 2015, she was on the board of Whistleblowing Austria. On 30 June 2012, she was guest of honor in the annual \\"multiculture ball\\" organized by the Afro-Asian Institute Graz (AAI Graz). On 10 May 2017 she was appointed to the supervisory board of the Wiener St√§dtische Versicherungsverein. Kneissl with Britain's Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, 16 April 2018 Kneissl with Vladimir Putin, 18 August 2018 In her public writings and appearances Kneissl has often sharply criticised the European Union and raised controversy with remarks on migration. In July 2016, after the Brexit referendum, she criticised European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker as \\"cynic of power\\", \\"rowdy\\" and \\"arrogant\\", who \\"behaves as a Brussels Caesar, who has made it his goal to break agreements, if it seems useful.\\"contribution to the Sunday edition of the \\"Kronen Zeitung\\" A quote from her book \\"My Middle East\\" also caused controversy, as she criticised Zionism, founded by Austro-Hungarian publicist Theodor Herzl, as a \\"blood and soil ideology\\" based on German nationalism in the 19th century. On the issue of refugees, migration, and integration she was also accused of serving stereotypes. At the height of the refugee crisis in 2015, Kneissl pointed out that most of them are economic migrants and that asylum seekers are \\"80 percent\\" young men between the ages of 20 and 30. In September 2015, she said on public television that one of the reasons for the revolts in the Arab world was \\"these many young men\\", \\"testosterone- controlled\\", \\"who no longer managed to get a wife today\\" because they have neither work nor their own home, and thus could not achieve \\"status as a man in a traditional society\\". She also sharply criticised German Chancellor Angela Merkel as \\"grossly negligent\\" for her selfies with refugees, and later described the EU-Turkey refugee agreement as \\"nonsense\\". Such remarks led to criticism and caused doubts concerning her self-definition as a \\"conservative free-thinker\\", but also gained praise and sympathy from populist anti-mass migration party FP√ñ, to whose events she was increasingly invited. In 2016, FP√ñ leader Heinz-Christian Strache considered nominating Kneissl as presidential candidate, but eventually decided in favour of Norbert Hofer instead. After Hofer was defeated by Alexander van der Bellen, Kneissl criticised Van der Bellen on the occasion of the discussion about the headscarf-ban, doubting his intelligence, character and format. \\"Not only Trump, others also provoke\\", she said, criticising Van der Bellen and Pope Francis, who had compared refugee camps to concentration camps. Kneissl was nominated by FP√ñ as a non-party member for the post of Foreign Minister of Austria in the government of Sebastian Kurz. Kneissl is the third woman to hold this function. Her nomination might also be linked to the reservations expressed by head of state Van der Bellen concerning other FP√ñ-endorsed candidates for the post. Kneissl was praised by FP√ñ leader Heinz-Christian Strache as \\"a great personality, a female Kreisky perhaps in the future when it comes to mediation, acceptance and advertising for Austria abroad.\\" In addition to her native German, Kneissl works in Arabic, English, French, and Spanish. Furthermore, she speaks Hebrew, Hungarian, and Italian. In August 2018, she married entrepreneur Wolfgang Meilinger, 54, at a ceremony in the small town of Gamlitz, near the border with Slovenia.

Each package of downloadable content has added new player versus environment (PvE) missions and player versus player (PvP) modes, new locales to visit, and new items for the player to make use of. Year One of the game featured two small expansion packs. The first was Curse of Osiris in December 2017, which was followed by Warmind in May 2018. Year Two began with one large expansion and had three premium content drops, available by way of the Annual Pass. The expansion was Forsaken, which was released in September 2018 and has had the largest effect on the game thus far, featuring an overhaul on gameplay. Upon the release of the third expansion, retailers issued Destiny 2: Forsaken Legendary Collection, which included Destiny 2 and all DLC up to and including Forsaken as well as its Annual Pass. The Annual Pass was also made available upon the release of Forsaken, with its three content drops, Season of the Forge, Season of the Drifter, and Season of Opulence, releasing in December 2018, March 2019, and June 2019, respectively. Year Three began with the fourth expansion, Shadowkeep, which released in October 2019 as a standalone expansion, not requiring players to purchase any of the previous expansions. It featured four seasonal content offerings, which were available to purchase separately, unlike the seasons of the Annual Pass. These were Season of the Undying, which was released alongside Shadowkeep, followed by Season of Dawn, Season of the Worthy, and Season of Arrivals, releasing in December 2019, March 2020, and June 2020, respectively. Year Four will begin with the fifth expansion, Beyond Light, to be released on November 10, 2020 along with four seasonal content offerings as well. Year Five will see the release of the sixth expansion, The Witch Queen in 2021, and Year Six will see the release of the seventh expansion, Lightfall (working title) in 2022. ==Overview== Prior to the release of Destiny 2, Bungie said that they had already begun work on post- release content. Bungie said they planned on providing post-release content at a quicker rate than that of the original Destiny, which was criticized for not having enough content post-launch and between each of its expansions' releases. Bungie also announced the Destiny 2 Expansion Pass prior to launch, which granted access to the first two expansions of the game, Curse of Osiris and Warmind. Throughout Year One, Destiny 2 featured periodical holiday-themed events, in addition to the expansions. Year Two featured one large expansion, Forsaken, the periodical events, and three premium content drops, available via the Annual Pass. Like the original game, whenever a new expansion released for Destiny 2, players were required to have purchased the preceding expansion in order to be able to play the newer one. Beginning with the Shadowkeep expansion in October 2019, it and all future expansions are considered standalone experiences, not requiring the player to have bought the preceding additional content. ==Curse of Osiris== Destiny 2s first DLC pack, Curse of Osiris, was released on December 5, 2017. The expansion added new content and focuses on the character Osiris from the lore of the original Destiny and for whom the Trials of Osiris PvP mode in the original was named. The expansion takes players to the planet Mercury with its own patrol mode. Certain missions and strikes require players to progress through the Infinite Forest, an area that features prodecurally-generated terrain and enemies, and which has been reused for later events. Additionally, the EXP-level cap was raised to 25 and the Power level cap was raised to 330. In addition to the character Osiris, his Ghost named Sagira was added with a female voice, as well as the character Brother Vance from the original game, who is now the Non-player character (NPC) of Mercury in The Lighthouse (formerly an exclusive social space in Destiny for those who went flawless in Trials of Osiris). There was also a timed-exclusive Crucible map for PS4 players called Wormhaven. Instead of an entirely new raid, a new feature called raid lair was added, featuring new areas to the existing Leviathan raid and a different final boss. ===Plot=== In the aftermath of The Red War, Ikora Rey calls the Guardian to the Tower, explaining that her agents, the Hidden, discovered a damaged Ghost on the intact remnants of Mercury. Ikora identifies the Ghost as Sagira, belonging to her former mentor, the legendary Warlock Osiris, who had been exiled from the City years before the first game (detailed in the supplementary webcomic Fall of Osiris). Traveling to Mercury, the Guardian locates the gateway to the Infinite Forest, a simulated universe created by the Vex inside the planet's core, but is unable to enter; the Guardian then comes under attack from Vex constructs from various points in time. Brother Vance, the fanatical leader of the Followers of Osiris (returning from House of Wolves), directs the Guardian to a hidden temple in an abandoned radio tower in the EDZ on Earth, with a modified Vex device that can restore Sagira. The device temporarily merges Sagira with the Guardian's Ghost, allowing them to access the gateway to the Infinite Forest. Inside the Forest, the Guardian encounters reflections of Osiris created to explore its different simulated realities. The reflections explain that in the past, Mercury had been a garden world shaped by the Traveler, before the Vex arrived and created the Forest in Mercury's core. The Guardian witnesses a simulated future scenario created by Panoptes, the Vex Mind that controls the Infinite Forest, in which Light and Darkness no longer exist, all non-Vex life has been wiped out, and the Sun is darkened. Osiris' reflections claim that they have been unable to find a way to prevent the dark future, but believe that the Guardian may be the key to stopping it. Ikora directs the Guardian to the Pyramidion, a Vex construct on Io, which contains the location of a map that leads to Panoptes' lair. Following the Pyramidion's data back to the Forest and battling Red Legion simulations within, Sagira discovers that the map changes too quickly to find Panoptes. The Guardian travels to Nessus to obtain the core of a smaller Vex Mind to boost Sagira's processing power. Returning to the Forest's simulated past on a tip from Ikora, the Guardian combines the map data with Panoptes' algorithms from the moment of its creation, allowing Sagira to locate Panoptes' lair. At that moment, Panoptes itself arrives and forcibly separates Sagira from Ghost before ejecting the Guardian from the Forest. Regrouping at the Tower, Ikora accompanies the Guardian back to Mercury, where she forces open the gateway to allow the Guardian to return to the Forest. Upon reaching Panoptes' lair, the Guardian fights through Panoptes' simulated legions, but is unable to damage the Vex Mind alone; Panoptes prepares to \\"delete\\" the Guardian from the Forest when Osiris himself arrives to aid the Guardian. Osiris is able to hold Panoptes at bay long enough for the Guardian to weaken and then destroy Panoptes, freeing Sagira and preventing the dark future from occurring. The Guardian and Osiris emerge from the gateway, where Ikora invites Osiris to return to the City. Osiris declines, and bids farewell to his former student and the Guardian before returning to the Infinite Forest. Following the defeat of Panoptes, Emperor Calus extends another invitation to travel to the Leviathan on Nessus, where the fireteam of Guardians venture deep into the Leviathan's core to confront Argos, Planetary Core, the Vex Mind which was responsible for the transformation of Nessus (\\"Leviathan: Eater of Worlds\\" raid lair). After destroying Argos, the Guardians are nearly consumed by the Leviathan's fiery inferno, but are saved by Calus, who once again offers a place by his side and more than just the power of the Light. ===Critical reception=== Upon release, Curse of Osiris received mostly average reviews. It has an aggregate score of 57/100 for the PlayStation 4 version (based on 28 reviews), 57/100 for the Xbox One version (based on 9 reviews) and 61/100 for the PC version (based on 9 reviews) from Metacritic. ==Warmind== Warmind was released on May 8, 2018 and focuses on the Warmind Rasputin from the original game. This expansion takes players to the planet Mars in a new area called Hellas Basin. The expansion also features a new mode called \\"Escalation Protocol\\", a horde mode which can be started by any player in the patrol mode on Mars. Players fight seven waves of Hive enemies culminating in a unique final boss which rotates each week. A maximum of six players in a fireteam can participate in the mode but other players in the patrol area may join in as well. As well, the EXP level cap was raised to 30 and the Power level cap was raised to 380. In addition to Rasputin, a new character named Ana Bray (also from the lore of the original Destiny) was added, who serves as the primary NPC on Mars. A timed-exclusive Strike called \\"The Insight Terminus\\" was also added for PS4 players. Like the previous expansion, Warmind also includes a second raid lair on the Leviathan. The expansion also added progressive ranking systems for PvP, titled Valor and Glory. Players earn Valor in quickplay matches while Glory is earned in competitive matches, with each new rank earning greater rewards. Valor points are earned regardless of win or loss, while Glory points are earned by wins but reduced by losses. ===Plot=== Several months after the events of Curse of Osiris, the Guardian sets out for Mars, the first place where Humanity encountered the Traveler, pursuing the remnants of the Red Legion as they scavenge across the Solar System in their retreat. As the Guardian's ship arrives, orbital weapon platforms known as Warsats begin falling out of orbit and smashing into the surface. The Guardian receives a distress call on the Vanguard's private comm channel from a Hunter named Ana Bray, warning that the Hive have broken out of the southern polar icecaps and attacking the Clovis Bray Research Facility at Hellas Basin. The Guardian goes to the surface to assist Bray, who reveals that the central core of the ancient Warmind Rasputin, which controlled the Warsats, is inside the facility, and that the encounters with Rasputin in the Cosmodrome on Earth (as seen in the original Destiny) were fragments of his personality left behind following the Collapse. Reluctant to involve the Vanguard due to its policy of not pursuing past lives, Bray asks the Guardian to help her get inside Clovis Bray and protect Rasputin. From her ability to access the security systems, it is revealed that Bray had been a scientist at the facility, operated by her family, in her life before becoming a Guardian. As the Guardian fights through hordes of Hive to reach Rasputin's central core, the Warmind activates a javelin-like weapon called the Valkyrie to assist the Guardian in battling through the elite Hive forces. As the Guardian and Bray enter Rasputin's core, however, they are confronted by Commander Zavala, who excoriates Bray for focusing on her past life in defiance of Vanguard law, instead of helping the Guardians fight against Ghaul on Earth. As the facility shakes, Zavala reveals that Rasputin was \\"not the only thing to awaken on Mars\\". A Hive worm god called Xol, Will of the Thousands, has also arisen, and is directing the frozen hordes of Hive around Clovis Bray to attack the facility and destroy Rasputin. Bray insists that Rasputin is the key to defeating Xol, but Zavala refuses, considering Rasputin to be too dangerous. To bait Xol, Zavala sends the Guardian back to the EDZ on Earth, to investigate another shard of the Traveler broken off when it awakened at the end of the Red War. The Guardian finds the fragment in a Taken containment shield, and Bray is able to call upon Rasputin to retarget a Warsat in Earth orbit to fire on the fragment, disabling the shield. Returning to Mars with the fragment, the Guardian ventures into the Hive's caverns deep beneath Hellas Basin to locate Xol's feeding ground, where they encounter Nokris, Herald of Xol and the exiled son of Oryx, the Taken King (who was killed in The Taken King). After the Guardian defeats Nokris, they set down the fragment. Xol emerges, ignoring the fragment and burying the Guardian in the collapsing ice caves. Though the Guardian is able to crawl out of the rubble, Bray warns that Xol is heading directly for the Clovis Bray facility to destroy Rasputin, which would make the worm god all but unbeatable. Setting aside his reservations about the Warmind, Zavala reluctantly agrees to Bray's plan to use Rasputin in order to destroy Xol. As the Guardian fights through Xol's hordes, Bray calls on the Guardian to overload Rasputin's core to channel more power into the Valkyrie. After disabling the cooling system and forcing a core meltdown, the Guardian emerges on an exterior platform to confront Xol. With Bray's help in stabilizing the power to generate Valkyrie javelins, the Guardian destroys Xol in a pitched battle. The Guardian then joins Bray and Zavala at Rasputin's central core. Speaking in Russian (with Bray as translator), the Warmind declares that while the Bray family sought to make him into an \\"all-seeing savior\\", and the Vanguard sought to wield him as a \\"primitive weapon\\", he would define his own existence from now on, and defend Humanity on his own terms. Rasputin then releases a new network of Warsats to the edges of the Solar System and beyond, to ensure that \\"never again will a threat go unseen\\". Following Xol's defeat, the remnants of the Red Legion, led by Val Ca'uor, assault the Leviathan in an attempt to assassinate Emperor Calus. Calus once again calls upon Guardians to his aid (\\"Leviathan: Spire of Stars\\" raid lair). With aid from Calus's psychic powers, the Guardians repel the Red Legion assault and defeat Ca'uor. Calus then congratulates the Guardians for their efforts and tells them he awaits the day they stand by his side when the end comes. Although it was believed that Xol was destroyed, it is soon discovered after the defeat of Ca'uor that the worm god had in fact survived; the Guardian discovers an anomaly deep in the Grove of Ulan-Tan on Io, where Xol had been communing with the Taken there ever since being defeated by the Guardian. The Guardian investigates the anomaly and eliminates the Taken there, including three former enemies who were resurrected and Taken by Xol‚ÄîTa'aurc, Aspect of War; Urzok, Aspect of Hate; and Drevis, Aspect of Darkness. After eliminating the Taken, the Guardian obtains an exotic heavy sniper rifle called the Whisper of the Worm, revealed to be Xol itself transformed into a weapon so it could feed off the Guardian's kills in combat. ==Forsaken== The third expansion, Forsaken, was released on September 4, 2018, beginning Year 2 of Destiny 2. Similar to the original Destinys The Taken King expansion, Forsaken had a large overhaul on gameplay, though not to the extent that The Taken King had with the original Destiny. A large expansion, the story has a \\"western revenge\\" theme, according to Bungie. A large portion of the expansion takes place in the Reef's Tangled Shore, including a new raid called \\"Last Wish\\", which takes place in the end- game area, the Dreaming City, also located in the Reef. The developers claimed that it has more bosses than any previous raid (including from the original game) with a massive roam area, puzzles, and the raid will change over time based on players' actions in the raid itself. There is also a new mode called Gambit that combines PvE and PvP, and features its own ranking system called Infamy, which works similar to the Crucible's Valor ranking system. Two teams of four players compete against each other while facing PvE enemies. A new weapon type, a bow and arrow, was also added. The EXP level cap was raised to 50 and the Power level cap was raised to 600. A trailer displayed during Sony's E3 2018 press conference showed the death of Cayde-6 by the hands of the returning Prince Uldren Sov. Uldren is on a mission to find his lost sister, Queen Mara Sov, believing her to still be alive after the events of The Taken King and he leads the Scorn, former Fallen that were revived from the dead and have become their own race. The launch trailer for Forsaken revealed that the player's Guardian would once again speak; the player's Guardian had not spoken since the end of the original Destinys base campaign. ==Annual Pass== The Destiny 2 Annual Pass was released alongside the third expansion, Forsaken, and was available as a bundle with Forsaken or could be purchased separately from Forsaken (although Forsaken is required to access the content of the Annual Pass). The Annual Pass included three premium downloadable content packages that were released in Winter 2018, and Spring and Summer of 2019. Content in these content drops included new endgame challenges, new weapons, armor and \\"vanity rewards\\" to collect, new and returning Exotics, new pinnacle activities, new triumph records to collect, and new lore to discover. All of the content of the Annual Pass became free to all owners of Forsaken on September 18, 2019 just prior to the release of the next expansion, Shadowkeep, which changed the way in which seasonal content is purchased and delivered. ===Season of the Forge=== Season of the Forge, also known as Black Armory, was released on December 4, 2018 as the first content drop for the Annual Pass. The expansion revolved around the exploits of Ada-1, a female Exo who has been left in charge of a late Golden Age weapon foundry known as the Black Armory. The story was much more loose and lore-driven than that of Forsaken, with the player piecing together the story of the weapon foundry via weapon lore tabs and minor quests given by Ada-1. The main new activity for the expansion was the \\"Lost Forge\\", where players forge weapons in Black Armory forges on the EDZ and Nessus while protecting the forges from waves of enemies. Players obtain weapon frames that can be purchased from Ada-1, then complete certain objectives for each weapon frame prior to participating in a Lost Forge activity. A new raid, \\"Scourge of the Past\\", was also released, and takes place in the Last City. In addition, the Power level cap was increased to 650, and four new exotic weapons were introduced‚ÄîLe Monarque (a poisoning combat bow), J√∂tunn (a handheld fusion rifle that shoots tracking fireballs), Izanagi's Burden (a sniper rifle that can fuse up to four shots into one powerful one), and Anarchy (a Fallen grenade launcher that can create an electrical grid). The Last Word, an exotic hand cannon from the original game, was made available through an exotic quest that was released near the end of the season. The Dawning holiday season event also returned and lasted from December 11, 2018 to January 1, 2019, featuring the return of Eva Levante from the first game, who serves as the event's main vendor. The Valentine's Day-themed event Crimson Days also returned, and ran for one week from February 12 to 19, 2019. Plot Following the events of Forsaken, the Guardian is given a mysterious seal by the Spider, leading them to a hidden section of the Tower known as the Annex. Here the Guardian meets Ada-1, an Exo who is the curator of the Black Armory, a weapon foundry that was founded during the late Golden Age, known for creating valuable and high quality weapons. Despite the initial hostility from Ada, the Guardian eventually earns her trust and wares, slowly piecing together the identity of the Black Armory's mysterious assailant who has been stealing the Lost Forges‚Äîused by the Black Armory to craft their weapons‚Äîfor themselves. After discovering three of the forges‚ÄîVolundr in the European Dead Zone, and Gofannon and Izanami on Nessus‚Äîthe Guardian discovers that the mystery assailant is a Fallen captain named Siviks, Lost to None, the forsaken brother of the Spider. Siviks, seeking to plunder the Black Armory vault in the Last City, dispatches an invasion force led by Insurrection Prime, Kell's Scourge, a Prime Servitor built into an immense bipedal war machine. A fireteam of Guardians confront and destroy the machine at a desolate section of the city housing the vault (\\"Scourge of the Past\\" raid), which later prompts the revelation of the last Forge, Bergusia, and its location in the European Dead Zone. Upon discovering and igniting the Bergusia Forge, the Guardian is able to unlock a mysterious box, containing a unique weapon frame, the likes of which Ada claims to have never seen. After a lengthy quest involving returning to Eleusinia and once more igniting the Bergusia Forge, the Guardian returns to Ada and forges the exotic sniper rifle Izanagi's Burden, the same weapon used by Ada centuries prior to take vengeance on the founders' murderers. One last time, the Guardian returns to the Bergusia Forge and confronts Siviks, killing him and returning a device known as the Obsidian Accelerator to her, restoring her lost memory and rebuilding the Black Armory once and for all. Sometime after the defeat of Siviks, the Drifter summons the Guardian to the Tower and gives them a tainted Hive artifact for them to cleanse using their Light. The Guardian defeats several Hive as well as Guardians in the Crucible, and then heads to Titan where a Hive ritual to create a Weapon of Sorrow is taking place. After disrupting the Hive ritual, the Drifter then advises the Guardian to sully their Light in order for them to stop a Hive weapon master from creating more Weapons of Sorrow. The Guardian taints their Light by defeating more Guardians in the Crucible, collecting Hive crystals and larvae, as well as disrupting Hive summoning rituals on both Titan and Mars. After doing so, the Drifter contacts the Guardian, stating he has located the Hive weapon master, Enkaar, the Anointed, on the Tangled Shore. The Guardian travels to the Tangled Shore and confronts Enkaar. Out of nowhere, the exotic hand cannon The Last Word appears before the Guardian and they use it to defeat Enkaar for good. The Guardian returns to the Drifter afterwards, who is extremely furious to see the Guardian wielding the fabled weapon, stating he knows its previous owner; the Drifter then warns the Guardian to not betray his trust. ===Season of the Drifter=== Released on March 5, 2019, Season of the Drifter, also known as Joker's Wild, was the second content drop for the Annual Pass and focused on the Drifter and his connection with the Nine. It introduced a brand new Gambit mode called Gambit Prime (a more intensive, single round-based version of Gambit, with some changes), as well as a new activity tied to it called \\"The Reckoning\\", a three-tier PvE horde mode that takes place inside the Drifter's mysterious ship and the realm of the Nine. The Reckoning's three tiers were released over the course of the season and awards new Gambit Prime role-specific gear with perks that can be used in Gambit Prime. The four Gambit Prime roles that are tied into the new gear are \\"Invader\\" (focusing on invading the opposing team's arena and stealing motes from their bank, color-coded red), \\"Sentry\\" (focusing on defeating blockers and invaders and defending their bank, color-coded yellow), \\"Collector\\" (specializing in collecting and banking motes, color-coded white), and \\"Reaper\\" (specializing in defeating enemies, color-coded green). Collecting a full set of gear tied to a particular role unlocks exclusive perks for that role. As well, the Power level cap was increased to 700; players who were below the recommended power level for the expansion's activities could obtain power surge bounties from the Drifter to obtain gear that would quickly raise their power level up to 640. The expansion also added two new Gambit maps and private Gambit matches; a nine-week quest called \\"Invitations of the Nine\\" that can be obtained from X√ªr starting from March 15 that unlocked new story and lore focusing on the Nine and their Emissary (who was formerly the NPC for the Trials of the Nine PvP mode from the base game); an allegiance quest that began on March 15 that allowed players to either side with the Vanguard or with the Drifter; a new spring-themed event called \\"The Revelry\\" that ran from April 16 to May 6, 2019, with Eva Levante as the returning vendor for the event; as well as two exotic quests, which awarded Thorn, a returning exotic hand cannon from the original game, and Outbreak Perfected (formerly known as Outbreak Prime), an exotic pulse rifle from the original game's Rise of Iron expansion. Plot Shortly after the events of Season of the Forge, the Guardian is summoned by the Drifter, who has moved down to the Annex. The Drifter invites the Guardians to participate in his new scam called Gambit Prime; he also invites the Guardian to visit his ship, the Derelict, after completing a few matches. The Guardian, upon exploring the Derelict, discovers that the mysterious haul tied to the back of the ship that, upon entering, leads into the realm of the Nine in unknown space. The Guardian fights waves upon waves of Taken inside the haul, including powerful Taken facsimiles of Nokris and Oryx. The Guardian also meets the Emissary of the Nine inside the haul, who reveals to the Guardian that it was the Nine who gifted the Drifter with the haul itself, and that the Taken and Primevals that the Drifter uses in Gambit originate from there, created by the Darkness and the Drifter's force of will. The Drifter finds out about this and advises the Guardian to not trust the Nine and to stop contacting the Emissary; he reveals that the Emissary was an Awoken named Orin who was close to Mara Sov before dying and being resurrected as a Guardian, and that she sought the Nine to gain power and was subsequently transformed into the Emissary. Despite the Drifter's objections, the Guardian continues to make contact with the Emissary via X√ªr over the course of nine weeks, which leads to a dark omen from the Emissary, foretelling the return of the Darkness. During these events, the Guardian is contacted by a Praxic Order Warlock named Aunor Mahal, who strongly advises the Guardian to not trust the Drifter‚ÄîAunor has been investigating the Drifter due to his connection with the Shadows of Yor, a group of renegade Guardians known as Dredgens who idolize Dredgen Yor, a former Titan who had been corrupted by the Hive and the Darkness and killed by Shin Malphur, a legendary Hunter who was also the previous owner of The Last Word exotic weapon; the Drifter has been training Guardians to become Dredgens themselves through Gambit. As a result, Aunor has made several attempts to persuade the Vanguard to expel the Drifter from the Tower by any means necessary. In light of this revelation, the Drifter contacts the Guardian and asks where the Guardian's loyalties lie‚Äîwhether if the Guardian remains loyal to the Vanguard or if the Guardian fully trusts the Drifter. Regardless of the decision made by the player, the Guardian learns more about the Drifter and his past through a series of recordings scattered throughout the European Dead Zone. In the recordings, it is revealed that the Drifter was resurrected by a Ghost during the Dark Age of humanity, becoming one of the first Guardians known as the \\"Risen\\", but he did not trust the Traveler's Light nor the Ghost that revived him. After several years trying to survive and live a normal, peaceful life despite getting into several conflicts with other Risen, the Drifter departed the Solar System during the onset of the City Age with a crew in search of a power \\"greater than Light\\". It was also revealed that the Drifter was also part of the Shadows of Yor for a short time until he had a falling out with a fellow Shadow named Callum Sol, followed by a testy confrontation with Shin Malphur; the Drifter also warns of an impending second Collapse, and that the Reckoning activity in the Derelict's haul was created to prepare Guardians for the looming apocalypse. Sometime later, the Guardian discovers a Fallen transponder on Titan, left behind by Mithrax, the Forsaken, a friendly Fallen who was initially encountered and spared by the Guardian during the Red War, and has since become their steadfast ally. The Guardian deciphers the transponder by finding six data nodes throughout the EDZ and Nessus; after retrieving the six data nodes, the Guardian uncovers rendezvous coordinates, leading them to Mithrax himself, hiding out in the basement of an old building on the Farm. Mithrax brings the Guardian to the ruins of the old Tower in the Last City, where Fallen House of Devils loyalists have broken into the Cryptarch vault deep within and have stolen preserved SIVA tech. The Guardian and Mithrax invade the old Tower ruins and neutralize Siriks, Loyal to Eramis, the Fallen captain behind the heist. After defeating Siriks, Mithrax recovers and gives the Guardian the SIVA-powered exotic pulse rifle Outbreak Perfected, in order to prevent the Fallen from using SIVA ever again. The Drifter eventually notices the Guardian's efforts, and asks the Guardian to \\"grab something\\" for him the next time they are in the old Tower ruins. ===Season of Opulence=== Released on June 4, 2019, Season of Opulence, also known as Penumbra, was the third and final content drop for the Annual Pass and focused on Emperor Calus from the base game's \\"Leviathan\\" raid, who is the main NPC for the expansion via his emissaries Benedict 99-40 in the Tower and Werner 99-40 on Nessus. The expansion raised the Power level cap to 750, and introduced a new six-player match-made activity called \\"The Menagerie\\", a PvE horde mode featuring raid-like mechanics that takes place on the Leviathan which awards weapons and gear that players can choose to earn via runes offered to an upgradeable item called the Chalice of Opulence. Runes for the Chalice can be obtained from weekly bounties, weekly chests on a new location on Nessus called the Imperial Barge, as well as from using a new consumable that will reward a rune from completing strikes and Crucible and Gambit matches. The Chalice itself can be upgraded by using a new currency called \\"Imperials\\", which are awarded by completing weekly bounties and treasure maps obtained from Benedict 99-40 and Werner 99-40, completing triumphs, as well as using a consumable that will increase the chances of obtaining Imperials from completing strikes, Crucible and Gambit matches, and the Menagerie. New bosses for the Menagerie were released on June 11 and June 18, and the heroic version of the activity sans matchmaking was released on June 25. A new raid, \\"Crown of Sorrow\\", which also takes place on the Leviathan, was released and made available the same day the expansion released; the expansion's opening quest must be completed in order to access the raid. Players who were below the recommended Power level for the expansion's activities were awarded gear that quickly raised their Power level up to 690 upon completing the opening quest, acting similar to the power surge bounties from the previous season. Three exotic quests were also made available, which awarded Truth, a homing exotic rocket launcher from the original game, and Lumina, a brand new exotic hand cannon similar to Thorn. A third exotic quest, which awarded Bad Juju, an exotic pulse rifle also from the original game, was also released in the form of a brand new activity and space called \\"The Tribute Hall\\", which released on July 9. Players can obtain golden tribute statues for their Tribute Hall by completing in-game triumphs as well as purchasing tributes directly from a statue called the Visage of Calus. Completing bounties obtained from the Visage of Calus lower the cost of purchasing tributes directly from the statue, with only four bounties (each giving 1% discount) being able to be completed each day. The maximum discount for purchasing tributes is 80%. The expansion also saw the return of the yearly \\"Moments of Triumph\\" on July 9, as well as the return of the Solstice of Heroes summer event on July 30, with Eva Levante once again returning as the main vendor for the event. Plot Following the events of Season of the Drifter, the Guardian is given an imperial summons by Benedict 99-40 (who has also moved to the Annex in the Tower) on the orders of Emperor Calus of the Cabal. The Guardian is invited to partake in treasure hunts across the Solar System, as well as exploring the Leviathan's Menagerie‚Äîdescribed by Calus as the Leviathan's oldest deck and once served as a prison for the Emperor and his Loyalist Cabal after Ghaul usurped Calus's throne and sent them into exile, now turned into an arena that pits Vex and Hive captured by Calus against Guardians for the Emperor's own entertainment‚Äîand other tasks that the Emperor has created for them. After participating in the Menagerie, the Guardian returns to Werner 99-40 on Nessus and is informed by Calus that one of his Loyalist Shadows, Gahlran, the Sorrow-Bearer, was given a Hive artifact called the Crown of Sorrow in an attempt to control the Hive, but instead triggered a trap laid by Savath√ªn, causing Gahlran to fall under her control; as a result, the Leviathan has been overrun by the Hive. Wanting the Leviathan cleansed of the Hive infestation and his former Shadow put down, a fireteam of Guardians assembled by Calus make their way into the vessel's treasure vaults deep within the Menagerie and confront Gahlran (\\"Crown of Sorrow\\" raid). With the aid of Savath√ªn's magics, the Guardians slay the mad Shadow, rendering the Crown of Sorrow inert. Calus rewards the Guardians with treasure and formally makes them his Shadows. Sometime after the defeat of Gahlran, Calus invites the Guardian to travel to the Leviathan, where the Emperor has erected a tribute hall onboard the vessel to celebrate the Guardian and their legacy. At first the hall is empty but Calus advises the Guardian to complete tasks across the Solar System to earn golden tribute statues for the hall. After the Guardian fills the hall with some tributes, a portal to the Ascendant Realm appears in the middle of the hall, indicating that the Leviathan was pulled partially into the Ascendant Realm as a result of the Crown of Sorrow's influence. The Guardian ventures into the Ascendant Realm and defeats both Taken originating from the Hellmouth on Earth's Moon and Calus's Loyalists deep within. After surviving the onslaught, the Guardian escapes the Ascendant Realm and returns to the tribute hall, where a display case below the Ascendant portal unlocks and rewards the Guardian with the exotic pulse rifle Bad Juju. == Shadowkeep == On June 6, 2019, Bungie announced the next expansion, Shadowkeep, which was planned to be released on September 17, 2019, but was delayed to October 1, 2019. The expansion is set on the Moon and features the return of Eris Morn and is similar in scale to Forsaken. Shadowkeep does not have any dependencies on previous DLC. Its release coincides with a number of changes brought upon by Bungie breaking away from its publishing agreement with Activision, including the transition of the PC version from Battle.net to Steam, release for the Stadia cloud gaming platform, cross-save support between platforms, discontinuation of PlayStation 4-exclusive content, and release of a \\"foundational\\" version of Destiny 2 as a free-to-play title, under the name \\"New Light\\", which also includes the first two expansions. == Beyond Light == On June 9, 2020, Bungie announced the fifth expansion, Beyond Light, which was planned to be released on September 22, 2020, but was delayed to November 10, 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The expansion is set on Europa, a moon of Jupiter, and features the return of the Exo Stranger from the first game and is similar in scale to Forsaken and Shadowkeep. The expansion will also bring back the Cosmodrome on Earth as a playable destination as well as the \\"Vault of Glass\\" raid from the first game. For the first time in the franchise's history, players will be able to wield the Darkness in battle, featuring new Darkness-based subclasses and a fourth, Darkness-based element called Stasis. Similar to Shadowkeep, Beyond Light is a standalone expansion and will not require any dependencies on previous DLC. ==References== Category:2017 video games Category:2018 video games Category:Action role-playing video games Category:Activision games Category:Fiction about amnesia Category:Bungie games Category:Destiny (series) Category:First-person shooters Category:Windows games Category:Multiplayer video games Category:PlayStation 4 games Category:Post-apocalyptic video games Category:Science fiction video games Category:Video games developed in the United States Category:Video games set in Europe Category:Video games set on Mars Category:Lists of video game downloadable content Category:Video game downloadable content Category:Video games with expansion packs Category:Xbox One games ","title":"Destiny 2 post-release content"},{"id":"56062863","text":"Anthony Watson (born February 5, 1941) is an American athlete.

Henry L Roberts, Review of Nehru biography, Foreign Affairs, October 1959. M. A. C. observes in Pakistan Horizon that Brecher's book, The Struggle for Kashmir, is a \\"painstaking but not a balanced study\\". The reviewer points out that there are examples of facts being misrepresented to Pakistan's disadvantage. Holden Furber calls it a careful study based on relevant published materials. But despite that Furber comments that Brecher's approach lacks ground research and he is more a scholar who has lived among United Nations reports in libraries. Percival Spears sees that Brecher tends to too readily accept Indian arguments for Kashmir and Junagadh and relies on Alan Campbell Johnson who is seen as prejudiced in Pakistan. Spear also observes that Brecher has a tendency to readily accept Indian reasons for rejecting each proposal in the discussions on conditions for plebiscite and also a tendency to underrate the importance of the Pakistani acceptances of proposals made through January 1951 to the Graham negotiations. ==Honours and awards== * 1959 - Watumull prize of the American Historical Association for his biography of Jawaharlal Nehru * 1964 - Rockefeller Foundation scholarship * 1965 - John Simon Guggenheim Fellowship * 1970 and 1976- Killam scholarship * 1986 - Fieldhouse Prize from McGill University for excellence in research From Brecher's French-language Wikipedia article * 1999-2000, President, International Studies Association * 2000, Leon-Gerin Quebec Prize for the Human Sciences * 2000, Award for High Distinction in Research, McGill University * 2009, Lifetime Achievement Award, American Political Science Association (Conflict Processes) McGill/Political science webpage ==External links== * ==References== Category:Living people Category:1925 births Category:Yale University alumni Category:Canadian political scientists Category:McGill University faculty Category:Fellows of the Royal Society of Canada ","title":"Michael Brecher"},{"id":"56062986","text":"Pendular nystagmus is a sinusoidal oscillation, which refers to the waveform of involuntary eye movements that may occur in any direction.

Since the Jurassic, subduction off the western margin of South America has generated volcanism, which after starting in the Cordillera de la Costa now occurs in the Andes.

There, some stratovolcanoes including TulTul, Del Medio and Pocitos are aligned on the Calama-Olacapato-El Toro fault which cuts across the plateau in southeast direction. TulTul, Del Medio and Pocitos are constructed by andesite and dacite and form a long alignment. Del Medio and Pocitos both feature traces of their southern flank collapsing, and both have a summit caldera and wide respectively. Tul Tul had a central vent which formed andesitic lava flows and later above these lava flows dacitic domes. The volcanoes were active 8 to 6 million years ago, during the Miocene. Lava domes were emplaced on all three volcanoes late in their history. The magmas that constructed these volcanoes appear to have originated in the lower crust from a garnet- bearing precursor. Moraines developed at elevations exceeding elevation on Del Medio and Pocitos, consisting of features on the walls of a cirque and two lateral moraines downvalley. These moraines formed before the last glacial maximum, but during wet periods in the Salar de Uyuni. == References  External links == * Geolog√≠a y petrolog√≠a de los volcanes cenozoicos Pocitos, Del MEdio y Tul Tul, provinciade Salta, Argentina Category:Volcanoes of Argentina Category:Miocene volcanoes ","title":"TulTul, Del Medio and Pocitos"},{"id":"56063041","text":"is a Japanese athlete.

She was one of the best known illustrators of children's books in the German Democratic Republic. == Life == Ingeborg Meyer- Rey was born in Berlin. When she was 20 she embarked on a study of illustration and wall-art at the Berlin University of the Arts in Berlin- Charlottenburg. In 1946 she obtained a job as a press artist for the T√§gliche Rundschau, a hitherto defunct newspaper title that had been revived by the military administration which since May 1945 had been in control of a large central portion of Germany, including the eastern half of Berlin itself. One year later she took a job in the arts department, working as an illlustrator, at the Soviet Arts Palace (\\"Haus der Kultur der UdSSR\\"), where she stayed till 1950. It was in 1950 that her son, Grischa Meyer, was born: his father, Grigorij Weiss, was a Soviet cultural administrator. It was during this period that she designed the early issues of the monthly Roman-Zeitung, a magazine designed to popularise Soviet literature. She also produced her first published illustrations for children's books, which marked a decisive step in her career. Meanwhile the political situation in what had been the Soviet occupation zone moved forwards in October 1949 when the entire zone was relaunched as the Soviet sponsored German Democratic Republic. In the early 1950s Meyer-Rey began working as a freelance illustrator, with connections to various publishing houses, of which probably the most significant was \\"Kinderbuchverlag Berlin\\". In 1957 she created \\"Bummi\\" the teddy bear, the main character in the eponymous monthly, later biweekly magazine for pre- school children. Bummi was at the heart of a long-running professional association with Ursula Werner-B√∂hnke who edited the magazine. As well as the book and magazine illustrations, Bummi also appeared on a silk stage curtain that she made for the Berlin Puppet Theatre. Meyer-Rey was a member of the National Association of Visual Artists (\\"Verband Bildender K√ºnstler der DDR\\"). Her illustrations applied a figurative-realistic approach, which was deeply influenced by Soviet artists of the time. An exceptionally prolific artist, she can be seen as one of the best known and most influential illustrator of children's books in the German Democratic Republic, where generations of children, especially during the eaerly years of their school careers, used textbooks that incorporated her illustrations. Many of her books worked through a succession of editions and some are still (2017) in print. Her work also achieved success with publishers abroad, natably in Sweden, the Netherlands, Britain, France, Jugoslavia, Denmark, Finland, Norway, Hungary, the United States of America, Cuba, Czechoslovakia, China and even West Germany, where editions were also published in Sorbian. \\"Der gute Held. M√§rchen der V√∂lker der Sowjetunion\\" (\\"The Good Hero: Fairy Tales from the Soviet People\\"), illustrated by Ingeborg Meyer-Rey, was celebrated (by election) as one of the German Democratic Republic's Most Beautiful Books in 1952. == Publications (selection) == * with Elisabeth Schwarz: Das erste Schuljahr.

The S-Bahn is operated by the Elbe Saale Bahn, a subsidiary of DB Regio S√ºdost, on behalf of the Nahverkehrsservice Sachsen-Anhalt (\\"public transport service of Saxony- Anhalt\\", a state government agency that plans, manages and funds public transport services in the state). The S-Bahn currently consists of one line between Sch√∂nebeck-Salzelmen, Magdeburg, Stendal and Wittenberge, using the Sch√∂nebeck‚ÄìG√ºsten, Magdeburg‚ÄìLeipzig and Magdeburg‚ÄìWittenberge lines. == History== The Magdeburg S-Bahn was opened on 29 September 1974 as a 38 kilometre-long line, on the Zielitz‚ÄìMagdeburg‚ÄìSch√∂nebeck-Salzelmen route, running north‚Äìsouth. The halts (Haltepunkte) of Sch√∂nebeck-Frohse, Sch√∂nebeck S√ºd and Zielitz Ort were opened after 1974. The halt of Barleber See is served only between early May and late October as it serves leisure traffic to the lake of the same name, which is located north of Magdeburg. There was an hourly connection between Sch√∂nebeck and Haldensleben in GDR times with an S-Bahn set shortened to one carriage and hauled by a DR class 110 or DR class 112 diesel locomotive. Passengers could travel on this train to Magdeburg- Rothensee on an S-Bahn fare. From 9 December 2007 until 13 December 2014, the S1 service operated only on Mondays to Fridays and only during the day except for a few trains; the stops were served by Regionalbahn services at the weekend. On 14 December 2014, the previous Regionalbahn service to/from Wittenberge, now to/from Stendal, was integrated into S-Bahn line 1, to end the parallel service by two different types of train service between Sch√∂nebeck-Salzelmen and Zielitz Ort. The trains changed their designated train class in Stendal station, but passengers did not need to change. This reverted after seven years to the S1 running between Sch√∂nebeck-Salzelmen and Zielitz Ort every 30 minutes on weekdays and hourly on the weekend. Due to the extension to the surrounding area, it was renamed from S-Bahn Magdeburg to the current name of S-Bahn Mittelelbe. The change in train class in Stendal was abolished at the timetable change on 13 December 2015, so that the trains now run to/from Wittenberge as S-Bahn services. The service between Zielitz and Stendal was extended by two additional train pairs in the morning (Mon‚ÄìFri), creating a 30-minute cycle. A few trains run between Stendal and Salzwedel as Regionalbahn 32, changing train class in Stendal. In addition, during the peak, a train runs as the S1X service from Magdeburg to Wittenberge and back; this does not stop at all stops so that it can connect with long-distance services. == S-Bahn fares== The Magdeburg S-Bahn and all regional trains operated parallel to the S-Bahn until the establishment of the Magdeburger Regionalverkehrsverbund (Magdeburg Regional Transport, branded as marego) on 12 December 2010 used a special S-Bahn fare structure modelled on the former DR S-Bahn fare structure. In contrast to these, a separate fare for the Magdeburg S-Bahn only was not introduced until 1 February 1994. There were separate S-Bahn fares earlier in the cities of Berlin, Dresden, Erfurt, Leipzig/Halle and Rostock. In contrast to Magdeburg, however, these were replaced much earlier by the various transport associations or abolished in the case of Erfurt with the abandonment of the S-Bahn. The Magdeburg S-Bahn fares were a bit cheaper than the standard nationwide local transport fares. It was not based like the latter on the actual trip distance, but on a zone system. It consisted of three zones: *northern fare zone (Zielitz and Wolmirstedt) *urban fare zone (urban Magdeburg) *southern fare zone (Sch√∂nebeck) The urban fare zone was always counted twice, so there were a total of four price levels. In addition to single tickets the S-Bahn Magdeburg also had multi-trip tickets, weekly tickets and monthly passes, but no day tickets (except the \\"Wochenend-Familien-Ticket\\": weekend family ticket) were offered. In addition, the S-Bahn fare was also offered on the Magdeburg- Neustadt‚ÄìMagdeburg-Herrenkrug route. For commuters and frequent travellers in Magdeburg between the S-Bahn and the nearby region, there was also the parent MUM (Magdeburg-Umland: Magdeburg surrounds) fare, which also covered the area served by Magdeburger Verkehrsbetriebe (Magdeburge Transport Company, a municipal utility). The MUM fare, however, was not a true Transport Association fare structure because only periodic cards (but no single tickets) were offered. This meant that for single journeys in the Magdeburg region, a new ticket had to be used with each change from the S-Bahn to another form of public transport. == Rolling stock== The typical trains operated on the Magdeburg S-Bahn in GDR times were green LOWA-E5 cars (central entrance cars). From 1990, single double-deck carriages were used, although in the early 1990s some four-part DB double-deck sets were also used. Class 425 sets are now used on line S1. In 2015, they were modernised and received new seats, folding tables, electrical outlets and an improved passenger information system. == Prospects== The √ñPNV-Plan des Landes Sachsen-Anhalt 2005 (public transport plan for the state of Saxony-Anhalt 2005) includes scenarios that include the conversion of several RB services into S-Bahn services in 2010‚Äì2015 and in 2025. These plans for a regional S-Bahn network were mainly promoted by the Minister of Transport, Karl-Heinz Daehre. The closure of services on the line to Loburg and the implementation of other measures, which are also reflected in the relevant procedures for procuring transport services, has made the original concept superfluous. The connection to Zerbst has been rebranded as part of the S-Bahn Mitteldeutschland 2 network, which is operated by the Elbe- Saale-Bahn, a subsidiary of DB Regio. The basic framework for the future S-Bahn network would be lines S1 and RB40 (Brunswick‚ÄìMagdeburg‚ÄìBurg). Further connections to Langenweddingen (as a replacement for the RB service to Oschersleben) and Haldensleben might also be integrated in due course. However, the planned operating concepts are for upgrades of the Magdeburg‚ÄìOschersleben‚ÄìHalberstadt and Magdeburg‚ÄìHaldensleben‚ÄìOebisfelde lines and the services would be operated permanently with diesel traction. ==References== Mittelelbe Category:Rail transport in Magdeburg Category:Transport in Saxony-Anhalt Category:Deutsche Bahn Category:1974 establishments in East Germany Category:2014 establishments in Germany ","title":"S-Bahn Mittelelbe"},{"id":"56063173","text":"The 1927 Cork Intermediate Hurling Championship was the 18th staging of the Cork Intermediate Hurling Championship since its establishment by the Cork County Board.

It was released on 23 February 2018 by BMG Records. It is his third album of classical music, following Seven: A Suite for Orchestra (2004) and Six Pieces for Orchestra (2012). ==Background and recording== Five is Banks's third solo album of classical music, following Seven: A Suite for Orchestra (2004) and Six Pieces for Orchestra (2012). Banks had thought of pursuing classical music at a later stage in his career when he could dedicate more time towards it. Five originated when Banks was commissioned to write a fifteen-minute piece for live performance at the Cheltenham Music Festival in July 2014, the seventieth instalment of the festival, by artistic director, Meurig Bowen. Banks chose a composition from a collection of short pieces that were in development at the time and worked on it further, which was then known as \\"Arpregg\\" but re-titled \\"Prelude to a Million Years\\" and became the opening track on Five. Banks spoke of the debut performance of the composition: \\"The softer passages were fine, but the parts that required real oomph, like the big cello riffs, didn't work very well at all\\". Following the Cheltenham Music Festival commission, Banks secured a one- album deal with BMG. It marks his first release on the BMG label, having released his first two classical albums on Naxos Records. Banks reasoned the change down to BMG being more of a \\"go ahead\\" label with more favourable promotional effort and its enthusiasm to release it. Banks then felt encouraged by the Cheltenham Music Festival performance to take the individual parts, re-record them, and assemble them in layers similar to that of a rock- oriented album so he could \\"really get it right\\". This approach was applied for all the tracks on Five. A series of \\"very definite and elaborate\\" demos were recorded which were then used as a template for the orchestra to play their arrangements from, and to Banks, sounded similar to the final arrangements. The piano heard on the album is what Banks had originally played on the demo recordings. The album comprises five orchestral pieces composed by Banks with their accompanying orchestral arrangements by Nick Ingman. Banks admitted that his percussion arrangements were \\"lazy\\", and credits Ingman for improving them to sound better than what he originally had in mind. Having scored several films in his career, he wrote the music on Five without any particular frame of mind, instead writing \\"what I write\\". The change in mood, tempo, and atmosphere in the pieces particularly interested him and compared the changes to Genesis songs like \\"The Musical Box\\" and \\"Supper's Ready\\". His composing for the album deviated little from developing pop and rock songs, but liked the greater sense of freedom that classical composition gives. Banks gave careful consideration to the titles of his pieces and wished to avoid names with \\"too much baggage\\". \\"Prelude to a Million Years\\" got its title from the 1933 same-titled wordless novel by American artist Lynd Ward, of which Banks is a fan. Banks maintained that \\"Renaissance\\" is not based on a piece developed during a Genesis rehearsal session despite what a promotional material for the album had included. A Billboard article noted a resemblance to the band's song \\"The Carpet Crawlers\\" from The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway (1974) on \\"Reveille\\". ==Release== After it was first announced in December 2017, Five was released on CD and a two LP set on 23 February 2018. It was originally set for release on 2 February, but management at BMG moved it forward as they wanted to conduct further promotional work for the album prior to releasing it. Banks considers a fourth classical album containing a four- movement symphony would be a point of stopping his venture into the genre. He also hopes the material on Five is performed live in concert in some capacity, at some point. ==Track listingPersonnel== Music *Czech National Symphony Orchestra and choir *Nick Ingman ‚Äì conductor, orchestrations *Tony Banks ‚Äì composer, piano, celesta *John Barclay ‚Äì cornet, trumpet (tracks 2, 4) *Martin Robertson ‚Äì saxophone (tracks 3, 5), duduk (track 5) *Frank Ricotti ‚Äì percussion *Skaila Kanga ‚Äì harp Production *Tony Banks ‚Äì production, liner notes *Nick Davis ‚Äì production, mixing *Simon Rhodes ‚Äì engineer *Steve Price ‚Äì engineer *Tom Mitchell ‚Äì mixing *Stefan Knapp ‚Äì artwork *Miles Showell ‚Äì mastering *Joanne Greenwood ‚Äì co-ordinator *Ron Shillingford ‚Äì copyist *Ryan Art ‚Äì sleeve design *Tony Smith ‚Äì management at Tony Smith Personal Management *Emily Banks ‚Äì photography *Cliff Masterson ‚Äì transfers ==References== Category:2018 albums Category:Tony Banks (musician) albums ","title":"Five (Tony Banks album)"},{"id":"56063304","text":"Jan III Sobieski is a Polish brand of cigarettes, currently owned and manufactured by British American Tobacco. The brand is named after the 17th- century Polish King Jan III Sobieski. ==History== The brand was introduced in March 1994. When BAT began the manufacturing process, they became one of the key products of the foreign owner. The brand has become a phenomenon in the world, because in a few months it gained a very large market share, leading to a rapid rise in Polish statistics concerning the manufacture of cigarettes. In 2000, the cigarettes were some of the most popular brands of tobacco products in Poland. In the class King and the product was the undisputed leader. Jan III Sobieski had 8% of the Polish cigarette market. ==Trade mark registration== In June 1995 BAT has submitted an application for a registration of the trade mark \\"Jan III Sobieski\\", strictly specifying the set of words, graphics, as well as the font and colors that had to be trademarked. However, acquiring the trademark was not easy, because the Polish Patent Office ran relatively hard politics and rebellious record characters using popular names. In the case of King Jan III Sobieski, it was considered that its use as a brand of tobacco \\"would undermine the moral standards, respect for national traditions of the people of the late King and that was a depreciation values and authority figures\\". Only after the revision of the emergency the President UP the name King John III had been registered by the Office. All three versions are registered by the Polish Patent Office and protected from June 1995 onwards, contain the word \\"Jan III Sobieski\\". ==Legal controversy== In the mid 90s. British American Tobacco launched the new brand of Polish cigarettes, which successfully went on the Polish market. However, four years after the founding of the brand of cigarettes to shops, there was a vodka brand bearing the same name, in which the logo on the label was confusingly similar to what was on the packaging of tobacco products of BAT. Belonging to the French group Belvedere S.A. make strong wines repeated success with the reputation earned by cigarettes. At the end of the 90s, Belvedere Distribution also introduced mineral water with the same name, at the same time, starting with the ad campaign of the new product.

It commemorates the alumni of the college who died in both the First and Second World Wars.War Memorial: Dulwich College (WMR-12610): War Memorial: Dulwich College WW1 and WW2 ‚Äì Cross (WMR-12610), accessdate: December 15, 2017 The memorial was designed by W. H. Atkin-Berry, an alumnus of the college. It was unveiled on 17 June 1921, the Dulwich College Founder's Day, by Major General Sir Webb Gillman, and dedicated by the Dean of Durham, James Welldon. Gillman was an alumnus of the college, and Welldon had served as Master of Dulwich College from 1883 to 1885. It has been Grade II listed on the National Heritage List for England since May 2010. The heritage listing places the memorial within a \\"visual and contextual relationship\\" with the Grade II* listed Main College building. ==Description== The memorial is 9 meters (29 ft) in height and is in the form of an octagonal stone memorial cross of Portland stone on an octagonal pedestal on a larger pedestal. There are bronze panels on each face of the bottom pedestal. The two pedestals sit on three tiered steps on an octagonal base. A bronze plaque on the western face of the top tier of the memorial is decorated with the Dulwich College Coat of Arms. Below this plaque are the words MORTUI VIVUNT, a bronze plaque below is decorated with a laurel wreath and the words PUERI/ ALLEYNIENSES/ MCMXIV‚ÄìMCMXIX. Seven further bronze panels list the 485 names of 481 pupils and 4 masters of the college who were killed in the First World War. Further names are on a smaller bronze plaque on the eastern face of the memorial. Instead of building a second memorial, the 352 alumni who were killed in the Second World War are commemorated by two plinths of Portland stone on the northern and southern sides of the memorial, with names of the dead marked on plinths on the eastern and western sides of the plinths. The WWII plinths were designed by John Wells-Thorpe. Prior to the erection of the two memorial plinths, the memorial stood on a pavement parked by four square bollards, these were subsequently removed. A new Great Hall for Dulwich College was also built as a memorial at a projected cost of ¬£50,000. The \\"Dulwich College War Record\\" was published in two books, containing portraits and biographies of the pupils who died with a list of their official military Honours and Distinctions. The books also contained a Roll of over 3000 people associated with the College who served in the British armed forces. ==References * Category:1921 establishments in England Category:1921 in London Category:1920 sculptures Category:Buildings and structures completed in 1920 Category:Dulwich Category:Grade II listed buildings in the London Borough of Southwark Category:Grade II listed monuments and memorials Category:Military memorials in London Category:Stone monuments and memorials Category:World War I memorials in the United Kingdom Category:World War II memorials in England ","title":"Dulwich College War Memorial"},{"id":"56063373","text":"The PMPV MiSu is a Finnish made six-wheeled amphibious mine-resistant ambush protected armoured personnel carrier (APC) designed for the Finnish Defence Forces as a possible replacement for its XA-180-series vehicles.

The basic appearance and configuration of PMPV Misu is similar to most wheeled MRAPs. The Misu is fully amphibious. ==Development== In 2009 Protolab Oy began planning a prototype vehicle intended as a replacement for the XA-180 vehicles used by the Finnish Army. In 2015 the first vehicle was sent out for field testing. After additional funding was received as an offset from the NASAMS deal, four vehicles are to be built. Two of these will be sent to the UK for testing the vehicle's functions against explosives. The fourth test vehicle will be the first production vehicle. In December 2017 the Finnish Defense Forces ordered 4 production vehicles. The vehicle's nickname \\"MiSu\\" is derived from the Finnish name \\"miinasuojattu\\" () and \\"PMPV\\" stands for \\"Protected Multi-Purpose Vehicle\\". The main superstructure is mainly manufactured from 6 to 12 mm of armour steel enhanced with Exote liner and the bottom is mine strengthened, the front windows are bullet-resistant. The vehicle has continuous six wheel drive and good capabilities for off-road driving. It can take inclines up to a maximum of 60%.

Diaz spent one year around Barnes and his associates. Barnes was subsequently arrested and convicted on a myriad of drug charges including conspiracy. Barnes is serving a life sentence in prison. Diaz was also largely responsible for \\"taking down\\" all of the primary members of Barnes' drug trafficking organization known as the \\"Council\\". This case involved the direct intervention of President Carter who ordered the then U.S. Attorney General, Griffin Bell, to see that Barnes was tried and convicted to the full extent of the law. The Barnes case was the first federal trial in the United States in which an anonymous jury was impaneled because of Barnes' reputation to coerce or bribe the witnesses. ===Operation Henry=== In 1982, Diaz was then involved in Operation Henry, an undercover investigation. Diaz and his partner worked with members of Scotland Yard in London in pursuit of a gang of British criminals who were involved in the sale and distribution of large quantities of heroin.

Lopez and Reyes were subsequently arrested in a major dragnet which saw the arrest of over 350 defendants nationwide and the seizure of over 9 tons of cocaine and over 100 million dollars in cash and assets. According to the former U.S. Attorney General, Edwin Meese, Operation Pisces remains the largest most successful undercover drug investigation in the history of the United States.Miles Beller, \\"A life in crime ‚Äì fighting it that is\\", Los Angeles Times, 18 December 2010. ===Operation Blast Furnace=== In 1988, the United States government, along with Victor Paz Estenssoro's government in Bolivia, launched Operation Blast Furnace, whose mission was to eradicate Bolivia's illegal coca producing fields and clandestine cocaine- producing laboratories located in the Chupari and Bene jungle regions.

They comprised Rory O'Donoghue (vocals, lead guitar), Rocco Bellantonio (rhythm guitar), Nino Bellantonio (bass guitar) and Paul Brownlow (drums). The band were popular on the wealthy North Shore party circuit in Sydney and also played university architecture revues, and it was at one of these revues that they met songwriter producer Peter Best. Best helped score the band a recording deal with Festival Records subsidiary label Leedon Records where they recorded their debut single, Claret and Tears b/w Heidi, in mid-1966. Both sides were composed and produced by Best (as were the A and B sides of all four of the band's singles), and like most of the Pogs' output were light, melodic, Beatle-esque pop numbers reminiscent of British bands such as The Zombies or even Herman's Hermits with Rory O'Donoghue's clear tuneful voice well to the fore. The one exception to this (though no less tuneful) was The Pogs' Theme - the B-side to the third single \\"I'll Never Love Again\\". Loosely based on \\"The One in the Middle\\" by Manfred Mann, \\"The Pogs' Theme\\" is a self- referential song complete with crazed hunting calls, choppy guitar chords and a wild sped-up outro. None of the band's four singles made the charts however, and in 1967 they were dropped by Leedon. The Pogs did make one further curio however - \\"Aboriginal Referendum Jingle (Vote Yes for Aborigines)\\" a tune in support of the \\"Yes\\" vote for the 1967 Australian referendum, also penned by Best. In 1967, the Pogs recruited organist Graeme Thompson and lost bassist Nino (who went on to further his architectural career). Thompson was then drafted into the Australian Army and was replaced by Bruce Hadden. Drummer Paul Brownlow also left to concentrate on his electrical business and he was replaced by Greg \\"Max\\" MacManus. The band also changed their name to Oak Apple Day (sometimes spelled Oakapple Day) and went into a more psychedelic rock direction, influenced by bands such as The Doors. Oak Apple Day continued performing in university revues, even touring with them professionally, and it was there that Rory O'Donoghue first collaborated with future Aunty Jack Show co-star Grahame Bond. Oak Apple Day made one single, with the Philips Records label in 1969 - a cover of the Traffic song \\"No Name, No Face\\", No Number backed with an original number by Rocco Bellantonio (though credited to Laurie Baker on the single label) named Oceans of Fire. An intense, organ driven psychedelic, almost early progressive rock track with a particularly fine vocal performance by Rory O'Donoghue. O'Donoghue was also booked as a session singer for a single entitled \\"Moonshot\\" (released in July 1969, obviously to coincide with the Apollo 11 moon-landing), which was a crazy, fun, psychedelic workout replete with spacey sound effects and corny control tower instructions (\\"All systems A-OK!\\"... \\"Trajectory A-OK!\\"). The single was written by the duo Bannerman-Stokes on the RCA label under the name Oak Apple Day with The Deadly Pair and it has distinction of being one of the first 45rpm singles in Australia to be issued in stereo. Stereo singles would not become commonplace in Australia until 1971. Oak Apple Day broke up in 1970 and Rory went on to play jazz before joining The If who performed The Who‚Äôs rock opera Tommy at the Elizabethan Theatre in Sydney. He also worked on the musical Jesus Christ Superstar before once again hooking up with Grahame Bond to play ‚ÄúThin Arthur‚Äù in the hit ABC TV comedy Aunty Jack. Running for two series in the early 1970s the show produced a couple of singles and an album including compositions from Peter Best. ==Discography== The Pogs: * \\"Claret and Tears\\" / \\"Heidi\\" (Leedon LK-1372), June 1966 * \\"Now That It‚Äôs Over\\" / \\"Hey Miss Thompson\\" (Leedon LK-1494), October 1966 * \\"I‚Äôll Never Love Again\\" / \\"The Pogs' Theme\\" (Leedon LK-1566), January 1967 * \\"Scenes From an Affair\\" / \\"Goodnight, But Not Goodbye\\" (Leedon LK-1838), August 1967 * \\"Oak Apple Day\\" (with the Deadly Pair): * \\"Moonshot\\"/ \\"Let‚Äôs Do it on the Moon\\" (RCA 101864), July 1969 Oak Apple Day: * \\"No Face, No Name, No Number\\" / \\"Oceans of Fire\\" (Philips BF-449), September 1969 All eight sides of the Pogs' singles (plus the Aboriginal Referendum jingle) are included on the compilation CD I Want, Need, Love You!: Garage-Beat Nuggets from the Festival Vaults (Playback Records: PBCD-001, 2016) ==References== Category:Musical groups established in 1965 Category:Australian pop music groups Category:Musical groups from Sydney Category:Beat groups ","title":"The Pogs"},{"id":"56063569","text":" Same ship as the troop ship U.S.A.T. Rosecrans Methven Castle was a steam iron passenger cargo ship built in 1882‚Äì1883 by Barclay, Curle & Company of Glasgow for Donald Currie & Co. with intention of serving as cargo, passenger and mail carrier on their existing route from England to South Africa. The vessel was later sold to the North American Mail Steamship Co. of Tacoma to work on their Oriental trade routes and renamed Columbia. In 1899 the ship was chartered by the United States Army to transport troops and supplies to various overseas destinations. In 1900 the Army bought out the ship and renamed her Rosecrans but sold it two years later to Matson Navigation Company. The vessel was then converted into an oil tanker to carry oil from the West Coast to Alaska and Hawaii. Subsequently she was sold in 1905 to Associated Oil Co. to carry oil from California to various ports along the Pacific Northwest and Hawaii. In January 1913 while on one of her regular trips, the ship was wrecked off the mouth of the Columbia River with the loss of almost her entire crew. ==Design and construction== In 1882 Donald Currie & Co. decided to expand their fleet of steamers serving on their South African mail route and placed an order for two new steamers with Barclay, Curle & Co. Methven Castle was the second of these vessels and was laid down at the shipbuilder's yard in Whiteinch and launched on 19 September 1883, with Miss Maggie Gilchrist, daughter of James Gilchrist, being the sponsor. The ceremony was attended by several local dignitaries including Archibald Gilchrist, owner of Barclay, Curle & Co. and his son James. Similar to many other vessels built for the Castle Line the ship was a three-deck type and had a large forecastle housing the crew. Methven Castle had her bridgehouse amidships built around the boilers and machinery. Passenger accommodations and amenities were located aft in deckhouses, and the vessel also possessed a large number of lifeboats. The ship was constructed with a possibility of her being called into Navy service with all three decks being built to be able to carry guns. The ship was also equipped with several steam winches capable to quickly load and unload cargoes from her holds. As built, the ship was long (between perpendiculars) and abeam, and had a depth of . Methven Castle was originally assessed at and and had deadweight of approximately 4,000. The vessel had an iron hull and a single 246 Nhp inverted direct-acting compound engine, with cylinders of and diameter with a stroke, that drove a single screw propeller and moved the ship at up to . ==Operational history== Following delivery and inspection, the ship sailed from Glasgow to London and after loading continued to Dartmouth. Methven Castle sailed out from that port on 15 December 1883 bound for South Africa via Madeira. After an uneventful journey the ship reached Cape Town on 10 January 1884. The steamer left South Africa on February 20 and returned to London on March 22, successfully concluding her maiden voyage. Due to her fairly small size compared to other vessels plying between England and South Africa, the steamer was used very sparingly during the first five years of her career. Typically, the ship served various ports of the Cape Colony such as Cape Town and Mossel Bay and occasionally proceeded further to Natal. Starting in 1888 she was put on a regular schedule to South Africa and the service was further expanded to also cover Madagascar and Mauritius. Additionally, in compliance with the Castle Line mail contract obligations, Methven Castle also made occasional stops at Ascension Island and Saint Helena on her way down to South Africa. The ship continued serving this route through the end of 1896. The vessel arrived at London from her last trip from South Africa on 2 February 1897, and after unloading continued on to Glasgow where she were to be laid up. While there the vessel was sold to Sir William G. Pearce via his representative W.M. Rhodes (future director of the Fairfield Shipbuilding Co.) for future transfer to Northern Pacific Line. The vessel was then chartered for one trip to the Orient and proceeded to Cardiff for loading and departing it on 29 March 1897 bound for Nagasaki with a cargo of 3,400 tons of coal. The vessel reached her destination at the end of May 1897 where she was renamed Columbia and transferred to her American owners. The ship then sailed to Hong Kong and after taking onboard cargo of various Oriental goods such as silk, tea and rice in addition to 120 passengers sailed for Victoria and Puget Sound ports via Yokohama. Columbia arrived at Victoria on August 28 after largely uneventful journey successfully completing her first trip under new ownership. Columbia conducted two more trips to the Far East in 1897. For example, on her third trip she carried full cargo of flour, lumber and other general cargo in addition to many passengers to China and Japan. On her return she ran into heavy gales and had her rails washed off and her rudder disabled for several hours. The vessel continued sailing on the same route through the end of August 1899. On 18 August 1899 it was reported that the U.S. Government chartered several commercial vessels, including Columbia, to transport troops and cargo to the newly acquired territories of the Philippines. Upon return from her last oriental trip Columbia proceeded down the coast to San Francisco, arriving there on August 23. Once there the vessel was officially chartered by the United States Army as of August 25 at the rate of 750 a day. After a quick check, Columbia loaded 635 officers and men of the Thirty Fourth Volunteer Regiment and sailed out for Manila on September 8. After stopover for coaling at Hawaii, the transport continued her trip and reached her destination on October 1. Columbia conducted one more trip to the Philippines, departing San Francisco on November 30 carrying elements of the Forty Second Regiment. Upon return in ballast from Manila on 10 February 1900, Columbia was put into quarantine for several days and then subsequently released from her charter. Less than a month after her release Columbia was purchased by the US Army for 147,200 and transferred to the Pacific Fleet to aid with transportation of troops and cargo to Alaska and the Philippines. The vessel was also renamed Rosecrans in honor of late general William Rosecrans. The transport then proceeded to Seattle and after loading her cargo of supplies and over 1,000,000 feet of lumber as well as 103 men of Seventh Infantry and fifty three other passengers departed for Port Valdez on April 25. After unloading the cargo and her passengers the ship returned to Seattle in mid-May successfully completing her first voyage in government service.{{free access} Rosecrans departed Seattle on June 2 on her next trip carrying two companies of the Seventh Infantry in addition to general merchandise, army supplies and over 800,000 feet of lumber bound for Nome. The journey was rather uneventful until the morning of June 10 when the vessel ran into a heavy fog bank. The ship was eventually forced to anchor as the fog remained thick. The heavy fog prevailed in the area until the morning of June 14 when it finally lifted and Rosecrans could continue her trip. As she continued north heavy ice fields were encountered forcing the vessel to carefully navigate through them. At about 03:00 on June 15 the ship suddenly ran onto a sand bar, located at roughly equal distance from both Nome and St. Michael's. About two hours later another steamer, SS Charles Nelson, came by and attempted to dislodge the grounded steamer but after breaking several hawsers and a steel cable departed the area for Dutch Harbor. An order was then given to lighten the vessel, and some cargo including general merchandise and some lumber were unloaded into life boats, surfboats and makeshift rafts. Tug Meteor arrived in the afternoon of June 17 and after further unloading and preparation work was finished managed to pull Rosecrans off the sand bar and into deep water. Meanwhile, due to increased wind many rafts and boats were blown away from the site of the rescue, and Meteor had to be dispatched to find them. After a long search several rafts and boats were brought but some of them were missing their cargo. Meanwhile, Rosecrans attempted to reach Nome, but due to prevailing ice she was forced to go into Dutch Harbor where she arrived on June 20. After her return Rosecrans was transferred to Philippines service and left San Francisco on September 3 with elements of Seventh Artillery bound for Manila via Nagasaki. The transport arrived at her destination on October 7 and remained in Asiatic waters for the next several months. On her next voyage the vessel carried elements of Fifteenth Infantry, the last American unit to leave China, to the Philippines. In January 1901 Rosecrans together with light cruiser and another transport Meade took part in rescue operation involving Sea Witch which was set on fire by her crew. Subsequently the transport was tasked with carrying more than thirty leaders of Philippine Revolution, including Pio del Pilar and Apolinario Mabini to the island of Guam. Upon return the ship together with several other Army vessels was assigned to return American volunteer troops to the United States. Rosecrans sailed out from Manila along with two other vessels on 16 March 1901 and arrived at San Francisco on April 19. After unloading Rosecrans sailed for Seattle where she was put into dock for repairs and installation of refrigerating equipment in preparation to her resumed service to Alaska. After completion of repair and overhaul, the transport sailed for St. Michael's in mid-August and returned at the end of September with the elements of the Seventh Infantry returning home from their deployment in Alaska. In November the transport again travelled to the Philippines carrying several companies of the Twenty Eighth Infantry as part of troop rotation. She sailed back to the West Coast in late January 1902 carrying men and officers of the Twenty Second Regiment and arrived at San Francisco on February 24. While Rosecrans was scheduled to leave for Manila again on March 10, she required some repairs and the War Department eventually decided to sell the vessel to the highest bidder with the bidding process starting in April 1902. The auction failed to attract much interest and the bidding period was extended into June, with the highest bid coming at 39,000. The government decided not to accept any of the bids due to them being way below the appraised value of the ship and Rosecrans was laid up in Sausalito awaiting better offers. In July it was reported that the War Department received a higher offer for the ship and after some consideration the bid was accepted. Three days later it was announced that Rosecrans was sold for 50,000 to the Matson Navigation Company who also announced their intention to convert the vessel into an oil carrying vessel. The ship remained berthed in Sausalito until September when she was put into Union Iron Works dock for overhaul and conversion. ===Sinking=== She ran aground, in bad weather, on January 7, 1913, and her distress was not immediately known. Survivors stated that the captain thought the North Head Lighthouse was actually a lightvessel near Clatsop Spit, and that the mistake caused the ship to hit Peacock Spit where it split in two. When rescuers on the United States Lifesaving Service motor lifeboats Dreadnaught and Tenacious were able to cross the Columbia Bar, they found just three of the crew of 36 still clinging to the ship's masts, which were all that remained above water. Both lifeboats capsized during the course of the rescue, and their engines were drowned, forcing the crew to resort to oars in the very heavy seas. Two of the men were successfully rescued; the third died of concussion. A third crew member survived by clinging to a floating piece of wreckage and being washed ashore. ==References== Category:1883 ships Category:Ships built in Glasgow Category:Merchant ships of the United Kingdom Category:Merchant ships of the United States Category:Tankers of the United States Category:Maritime incidents in 1913 ","title":"SS Rosecrans"},{"id":"56063591","text":"The 1980 GP Ouest-France was the 44th edition of the GP Ouest-France cycle race and was held on 26 August 1980.

P. Sundaram under the N. B. Productions banner. It stars N. T. Rama Rao, Anjali Devi in the lead roles and music composed by Ogirala Ramachandra Rao. The film was simultaneously made in Tamil with the same title. ==Plot== Narada smells food for himself in Ranbhas's endeavor to pollute the fervent penance of a Rishi and pricks her vanity, which ultimately results in the latter's expressions of her unique beauty and his challenge thereof. The opportunities that present themselves are many for Narada to insult Rambha in Lord Krishna's Birthday Durbar. When he crowns Kalavathy, the Lord Court dancer and his own disciple with the honor of a dance recital pair up with Vidhyadhara, another student of his, ignoring the claims of Kalavathy and Nalacoobara. The Lord presents a Manikyamala jointly to Kalavathy and Vjdhyadhara's claims, which the latter rejects when offered by the former. Now Vidhyadhara and Nalacoobara remain at Dwaraka the former with his Guru and later forced by his love for Kalavathi. Kambha is hurt on both sides and she too stays there to mend her husband Kalavathy methodically reveals to Vidhyadhara her heart which has reserved for him since their very first meeting and Vidhya learning love, often they meet in the garden of Narada Ashram. On one such occasion, Nala watches their intimacy in the form of a deer and becomes restless. The more Rambha tries to control him, the more obstinate he turns. He visits Kala's house and offers his all for her love, but in vain. Then he meets Kala in the garden in the form of Vidhyadhara, for whom she is waiting and appearing as Nala to Vidhyadhara who, having been engaged in taking Bhagavath Geetha from Lord Krishna, comes there late, makes him misunderstand that he (Nala) is the one who is really loved by Kala; with this stroke, Vidhya takes leave of his Guru to be away from Dwaraka and away from all that is feminine in the world. The innocent Kala goes out alone in search of him, not knowing her crime that is absent and Uddanda, her maids' husband starts in search of her. Nala, in his pursuit of Kalavathy, finds her in the forest and tries to molest her, diverting the path of Uddanda who approaches the spot, by creating a Yakshini when Rambha appears on the scene and Kala slips off, Narada comes there and informs Rambha of Indra's curse on her, whereby she is deprived of her divine powers, for neglecting her duty. Rambha mistakes Kala as reciprocating Nala's love and decides to do away with her life. Uddanda, for his misbehavior with a Parkaya Yogi is cursed by him to be a dove. Kalavathy, while searching for Vidhyadhara, is caught in a storm and finally loses his eyesight. Vidhya, who by now has almost completed his visits to temples, meets Kala's innocence is spoiled by yet another treacherous act of Nalacoobra, who gains Kala's sympathy in the form of a baby and creates the motherly atmosphere about her, on seeing which, Vidyadhara confirms her infidelity and goes away without speaking to the blind one. Taking his original form out of the baby, Nala again tries to molest Kalavathy, when earthly Kalpaka defends her, lowering Nala's caste. But the trials and tribulations of Kala who, though blind, throws off Kalpavalli's shelter and proceeds in search of Vidhya only to know her crime and die, never appears to end. Rambha, from behind the idol of Bhubaneshwari Temple instigates Kalpalika, a staunch devotee of Goddess and aspirant of Amrajyasiddi to sacrifice Kalavathy at the altar of the Goddess to gain his ends when he is out to sacrifice himself for the purpose. So Kalavathy now falls from the frying pan into the fire of merciless Kapalika's hands, who takes her to the altar under the pretext of showing her husband, and notwithstanding the appeal of the old Kapalani there, raises his sword which, while measuring its distance from Kala's neck clashes with another ==Cast== *N.

A diatribe (from the Greek Œ¥ŒπŒ±œÑœÅŒπŒ≤ŒÆ), also known less formally as rant, is a lengthy oration, though often reduced to writing, made in criticism of someone or something, often employing humor, sarcasm, and appeals to emotion. ==Historical meaning== The terms diatribe and rant (and to a lesser extent tirade and harangue) have at times been subtly distinguished, but in modern discourse are often used interchangeably. A diatribe or rant is not a formal classification of argument, and religious author Alistair Stewart-Sykes notes that \\"[t]he form of the diatribe is difficult precisely to ascertain\\".Alistair Stewart-Sykes, The Lamb's High Feast: Melito, Peri Pascha, and the Quartodeciman Paschal Liturgy at Sardis (Supplements to Vigiliae Christianae) (1998), p. 69. It has been proposed that the terms, diatribe, tirade, harangue, and rant, \\"are similar, but offer different shades of meaning\\":Andy Oppel, SQL: A Beginner's Guide, Fourth Edition (2015), p. 103. It has been suggested that a rant is merely one kind of diatribe, with one explanation stating that \\"[a] rant can be defined loosely as an emotionally charged narrative or diatribe often expressing a strong distaste or anger on the one hand, or a declamatory, often pompous, assertion on the other\\".Brian Clements, Jamey Dunham, An Introduction to the Prose Poem (2009), p. 149. A number of notable works have been described as diatribes, such as the Diatribes of Greek philosopher Bion of Borysthenes, in which he satirized the foolishness of people; the Diatribes of Teles of Megara written circa 235 BC, which present the basis of the philosophy of Cynicism; and the Diatribes, or Discourses, of Epictetus, circulated by Arrian circa 108 AD, introducing aspects of Stoicism. An examination of the use of diatribe by the 4th century BC Greek philosopher Euripides states: The opponent assumed to be argued against in a diatribe is \\"a fictitious individual introduced by the speaker merely as a part of the rhetorical machinery of his discourse\\", who states the position of the opponent before providing \\"indication of the untenability of that position by means of illustration, rhetorical question, proverb, argumentum e contrario, etc., and in conclusion a statement of the speaker's own view\\".Ethel Ella Beers, Euripides and Later Greek Thought: A Dissertation (1914), p. 84. Although a diatribe or rant is not inherently humorous, rants have become a staple of modern comedy, performed as \\"over-the-top ramblings with a single point of view on a wide variety of subjects\\".James Mendrinos, Jim Mendrinos, The Complete Idiot's Guide to Comedy Writing (2004), p. 38.Judy Carter, The Comedy Bible: From Stand-up to Sitcom--The Comedy Writer's Ultimate How To Guide (2001), p. 174. ==Diatribes in religious speech== Stewart-Sykes proposes that there is a difference between pagan diatribes, which he suggests are directed against a present individual, and Christian diatribes, which he suggests are directed against a hypothetical other person, but more fully intended to persuade the reader or listener. A noted historical example of a religious diatribe can be found in Paul's Epistle to the Romans.Arland J. Hultgren, Paul's Letter to the Romans: A Commentary (2011), p. 85. With respect to that usage, a diatribe is described as an oration in which the speaker seeks to persuade an audience by debating an imaginary opponent, \\"typically using second person singular\\". The speaker \\"raises hypothetical questions and responds to them or states false conclusions and goes on to refute them\\". The literary historian and theorist Mikhail Bakhtin notes that it was \\"the diatribe, not classical rhetoric, that exercised a defining influence on the generic characteristics of the ancient Christian sermon.\\" ==References== Category:Public speaking ","title":"Diatribe"},{"id":"56064016","text":"\\"Star Comes to Earth\\" is the first episode of the animated television series Star vs. the Forces of Evil.

However, after she fails to properly use it, her parents deem her to not be ready for the responsibility yet, and send her to Earth for training. The episode was well received by critics and fans, prompting the second season of the series to be ordered ahead of its premiere. == Plot == The episode begins with Star Butterfly (Eden Sher) narrating. She explains who is she is: a princess from another dimension, who is often seen as being reckless due to her hobbies, such as fighting monsters. She also explains that today is her fourteenth birthday, which means she will inherit her family's magic wand. After doing so, however, she accidentally sets fire to her kingdom. After doing so, her parents decide that she \\"can't handle it\\" and send her off to Earth for training, where she will live with a local family and go to high- school. After Star's parents bribe the principal of the high school to get her enrolled in the school, the principal assigns a student, Marco Diaz (Adam McArthur), to give Star a tour of the school. Marco complains to Star of how boring his life is, and how he wishes something exciting would happen, but after Star summons a monster and explains who she is to him, he runs away in fear. When he gets home, his parents reveal that they will be taking care of Star and having her live with them as a \\"foreign exchange student\\". A monster, who has been spying on Star, reports her location to his boss, Ludo, whose goal is to steal Star's wand and take over the universe. After this, Star creates a castle tower out of the side of Marco's house. When Star attempts to make a similar one for Marco, she accidentally creates a black hole. After this, Marco resolves that if Star is moving in, he is moving out. After looking for Marco and finding him, she attempts to reconcile with him, but they are attacked by Ludo's army of monsters. The two fight them off together, and after defeating them, Marco, impressed by Star's fighting skills and teamwork, decides to let her live in his house. == Production and broadcasting == \\"Star Comes to Earth\\" was written, directed, and story-boarded by Mike Mullen, with story by Daron Nefcy, Dave Wasson, and Jordana Arkin.

Disney sitcom actors Olivia Holt and Kelli Berglund participated in promoting the series the weeks before its Disney XD premiere, with Holt dressing up as Star. The Disney XD premiere was on March 30, 2015. == Reception == The episode's premiere on Disney Channel was seen by 2.33 million viewers. The positive reaction on social media prompted Disney XD to order a second season of the series in February 2015, six weeks ahead of its launch of the series on Disney XD. The episode's premiere on Disney XD was seen by 1.139 million viewers. Within the first three days, it had amassed 1.2 million viewers and became Disney XD's most-watched animated series debut in the network's 15-year history. It was also the second most watched premiere show on that network behind the live- action Lab Rats series. Kevin Johnson of The A.V. Club gave \\"Star Comes to Earth\\" a B+ rating, praising its \\"snappy action and energetic performances\\", its subversion of \\"princess tropes\\", and Star's energetic and optimistic character, although criticizing how its plot is \\"built on relatively flimsy excuses to its set up\\". He compared it to Steven Universe and Wander Over Yonder, the latter of which show creator Daron Nercy previously worked on. The show, as presented in \\"Star Comes to Earth\\", has also been compared to Invader Zim, Ren and Stimpy, and Sailor Moon. The episode's humor has been criticized as well, being described as \\"trying too hard to be funny and weird\\", but also praised for reaching a wide demographic. == Notes  References  External links == * Category:2015 American television episodes ","title":"Star Comes to Earth"},{"id":"56064023","text":"Antanas Vaup≈°as (20 May 1936 - 14 December 2017) was a Lithuanian athlete.

Knowles Memorial Home for Aged Colored Persons, built by the Public Works Administration in 1935. He also designed the bandstand in East Park, East Nashville, but it was removed in 1956. Southgate was a founding member of the Nashville chapter of the American Institute of Architects in 1922, and the founding members of its Tennessee chapter. ==Personal life, death and legacy== Southgate married Lizinka Elliston Farrell, a descendant of Mayor Joseph Thorpe Elliston and TN Rep. William R. Elliston, slaveholding owners of the Burlington plantation. The couple had four daughters. Southgate died of influenza on February 8, 1953 in Nashville. His funeral was held at St. George's Episcopal Church, and he was buried in Mount Olivet Cemetery. The Southgate Condominiums, an apartment building on West End Avenue, was named in his honor. ==References== Category:1887 births Category:1953 deaths Category:People from Nashville, Tennessee Category:Massachusetts Institute of Technology alumni Category:Architects from Tennessee Category:Burials at Mount Olivet Cemetery (Nashville) ","title":"Donald W.

Purging relies on the principle that a combustible (or flammable) gas is able to undergo combustion (explode) only if mixed with air in the right proportions. The flammability limits of the gas define those proportions, i.e. the ignitable range. ==Purge into service== Assume a closed system (e.g. a container or process vessel), initially containing air, which shall be prepared for safe introduction of a flammable gas, for instance as part of a start-up procedure. The system can be flushed with an inert gas to reduce the concentration of oxygen so that when the flammable gas is admitted, an ignitable mixture cannot form. In NFPA 56,NFPA 56. Standard for Fire and Explosion Prevention During Cleaning and Purging of Flammable Gas Piping Systems. National Fire Protection Association this is known as purge-into- service. In combustion engineering terms, the admission of inert gas dilutes the oxygen below the limiting oxygen concentration. ==Purge out of service== Assume a closed system containing a flammable gas, which shall be prepared for safe ingress of air, for instance as part of a shut-down procedure. The system can be flushed with an inert gas to reduce the concentration of the flammable gas so that when air is introduced, an ignitable mixture cannot form. In NFPA 56 this is known as purge-out-of-service. ==Benefits of having two purging terms== It is useful with two terms for purging because purge-out-of-service requires much larger quantities of inert agent than purge-into-service. The terminology of German standardsTRBS 2152 Teil 2 / TRGS 722. Vermeidung oder Einschr√§nkung gef√§hrlicher explosionsf√§higer Atmosph√§re. Technische Regeln f√ºr Betriebssicherheit. Ausgabe: M√§rz 2012 [Part 2: Prevention or reduction of explosive atmospheres] refers to purge-into-service as partial inerting, and purge-out-of-service as total inerting, clearly indicating the difference between the two purging practices, although the choice of the term inerting, rather than purging, can be confusing, see below. ==Comparison with other explosion prevention practices== Prevention of accidental fires and explosions can also be achieved by controlling sources of ignition. Purging with an inert gas provides a higher degree of safety however, because the practice ensures that an ignitable mixture never forms. Purging can therefore be said to rely on primary prevention, reducing the possibility of an explosion, whereas control of sources of ignition relies on secondary prevention, reducing the probability of an explosion. Primary prevention is also known as inherent safety. ==Confusion with inerting== The purge gas is inert, i.e. by definition non-combustible, or more precisely, non-reactive. The most common purge gases commercially available in large quantities are nitrogen and carbon dioxide. Other inert gases, e.g. argon or helium may be used. Nitrogen and carbon dioxide are unsuitable purge gases in some applications, as these gases may undergo chemical reaction with fine dusts of certain light metals. Because an inert purge gas is used, the purge procedure may (erroneously) be referred to as inerting in everyday language. This confusion may lead to dangerous situations. Carbon dioxide is a safe inert gas for purging. Carbon dioxide is an unsafe inert gas for inerting, as it may ignite the vapors and result in an explosion. ==See also== * ATEX * Flammability limits * Limiting oxygen concentration * Inerting (gas) ==External links== * Fighting Smoldering Fires in Silos ‚Äì A Cautionary Note on Using Carbon Dioxide.

They were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2012. ==Description and history== The Vine Street Apartments are located in Hartford's North End residential neighborhood, occupying most of a full block on the east side of Vine Street between Albany Avenue and Mather Street. The eleven buildings are all three stories in height and are built out of brick, stone, and concrete, and share a consistent and deep setback, although the lots are not of uniform width. The first nine buildings are fronted by a shared metal picket fence with brick piers framing several openings. Five of the eleven are Classical Revival in style, while another five are Tudor Revival, and one is in the Spanish Mission style. In the early 20th-century, the Vine Street area was part of the estate of James Junius Goodwin, an insurance and railroad magnate who was a cousin of J. Pierpont Morgan. Goodwin died in 1915, and his estate was subdivided for development as a streetcar suburb. Lots on Vine Street were sold beginning in 1922, with development taking place rapidly. Seven of the eleven buildings were designed by Harry Beckanstein, a local architect who executed many residential projects in the city.

Located in the northern suburbs of the city of Adelaide, South Australia, the parish's boundaries roughly coincide with the limits of the City of Salisbury. In the Salisbury Catholic Parish, there are three mass centres: St Augustine, St Finbar, the Holy Family; three parish schools: St Augustine School, Holy Family School, and Thomas More College; the Pioneer cemetery; and some parish and migrant groups and communities, as well as charities. The Parish celebrates a biannual carnival on the eve of Lent. == Churches and mass centres == The complex includes the old church, the new church, the presbytery, a school, and numerous small buildings, outbuildings and playing fields. === Old St Augustine's Church === The old building is of Gothic style and it is among the oldest constructions in South Australia. The City of Salisbury Council recommended its inclusion on the Register of State Heritage Items and on the Register of the National Estate due to its distinctive style and its landmark location on one of the main roads of Salisbury. Construction of the church was funded by voluntary subscription, beginning in 1847. Walter Hunter was selected as the architect responsible for building the church. Hunter had unsuccessfully contended for the design of St Francis Xavier's Cathedral in Adelaide, and had designed the Church of St John the Evangelist that was then under construction in Kapunda. Early settlers worked with bullocks provided by a man named Andrew O'Leary to cart stones from the nearby hills for construction of the church. The first foundation stone of the old St Augustine's chapel was laid on 1 April 1851, but its construction suffered setbacks, including a labor shortage caused by the Victorian gold rush. To add more difficulty to the project, both the architect and the builder died in the first year: Walter Hunter died on 19 April 1851, less than three weeks after the laying of the foundation stone, and contractor Peter Walsh died eighteen months later. The architect George Kingston supervised completion of the church by contractors Long and Co. of Adelaide. St Augustine's Church was opened by Bishop Francis Murphy on 1 March 1857, replacing a temporary church constructed of wood in 1848. In 1882, the community decided to buy a large bell, setting aside ¬£80 () for the purchase. Bishop Christopher Augustine Reynolds ordered a one-ton bell from Murphy's Bell Foundry in Dublin. The bell was blessed by Bishop Reynolds on 2 December 1883. The blessing of the bell provided the opportunity for a pageant for the local Catholic community. The bell remained in a wooden belfry at the rear of the church for 42 years. During the administration of the Rev. Fr Morrison as Parish Priest from 1916 to 1926, the church was renovated and refurnished, including the completion of a bell tower in 1925.New St Augustine's Church, Salisbury, South Australia The high altar was presented to the congregation in 1920 by Miss Nellie Sheehan of Melbourne, in memory of her parents. Today, the old chapel of St Augustine is listed as a heritage building and historical site, and it is still used for wedding ceremonies. St Augustine's Church was also colloquially known as ‚Äòthe Little Para,‚Äô ‚ÄòDry Creek,‚Äô ‚ÄòSalisbury Plains‚Äô and ‚ÄòSalisbury‚Äô church. === New St Augustine's Church === The new church building of St Augustine was constructed in 1972. During the 1980s, it was also used by the Greek Orthodox community until the St Dimitrios Church was erected at Salisbury Park. St Finbar Church, Salisbury, South Australia === St Finbar Church === This Mass Centre was built in December 1957, and officially opened by the Archbishop Matthew Beovich in 1958. The then Salisbury Parish priest, Fr Frederick Gatzmeyer promoted the construction of this Mass Centre. His parents had donated a chalice for any of their sons that would choose to become a priest, and he was the first of three brothers that became priests. This chalice is still in use at St Finbar's Church during religious services. ===Holy Family Mass Centre === The Holy Family Mass Centre is the newest mass centre, and is part of the Holy Family School complex. == Parish Schools  St Augustine's Parish School === This school is located next to the St Augustine's Church and it was founded by the Dominican Sisters in 1955, and based in the St Dominic tradition. In 2004 the school enrolled over 600 students. === Thomas More College === The Thomas More College was established in 1979.The Prospectus of the Thomas More College === Holy Family School === The Holy Family School is the newest Parish educational centre, opened in the 1980s. == The Pioneer Cemetery == The Pioneer Cemetery is the old churchyard of the Salisbury Catholic Parish. Once in the same building complex, it is now separated by Ponton Street from the St Augustine's Church and Parish School. == History of the Parish == According to a heritage survey prepared by South Australia's Department of Environment and Planning, ‚Äúthe history of the Catholic community in Salisbury is almost as old as that of the town itself.‚Äù Bishop Francis Murphy acquired the Leigh Farm from William Leigh in 1845. This farm at Golden Grove was part of a large bequest made to the Catholic Bishop of Adelaide and, when attending to the farm, Bishop Francis Murphy would regularly also visit the district and would offer Mass for the Catholic community. The first Catholic Mass was celebrated in 1846. By 1850, a school was opened in the area on the site of the current dining room and a bedroom of the present presbytery. The first chapel was built of pug and pine near the Pioneer Cemetery. This church was destroyed by fire in 1855. Meanwhile, the rising community had decided to build a more permanent church made of stone. In 1851, a centrally-located glebe land was acquired from the government through the efforts of Fr Ryan, the Vicar General at the time, and John Harvey, who had laid out the town of Salisbury. St Augustine's Church was built on this land. The first priest to serve St Augustine's Church was Fr Christopher A. Reynolds from Gawler. He later became the first Archbishop of Adelaide, and a memorial window above the high altar honours his memory. In 1869, Salisbury was severed from the Parish of Gawler and became an independent parish, with Fr Frederick Byrne being appointed as the first parish priest. In 1916, Fr John Eviston was appointed Assistant Priest and, together with the Parish Priest Fr R A Morrison, organised the renovation of the St Augustine's Church and grounds, and also rebuilt the presbytery. Soon after the bell tower was completed in 1926, Fr Frederick Gatzmeyer became the parish priest and served in this position until he was killed in a motor accident in 1957. He played an important part in the development of the Catholic community in South Australia. He was the youngest of three siblings that became priests and were raised by their German parents. He presided over the change from a rural to a metropolitan parish. In 1954, the Dominican sisters arrived to Salisbury and the first part of the St Augustine School was opened. The St Finbar's Church was officially opened by Archbishop Matthew Beovich in 1958. When Fr Philip Marshall left the Salisbury Parish, Fr Roderick O‚ÄôBrien was appointed as the Parish Priest. During his tenure, Fr Roderick O‚ÄôBrien organised the first Parish Carnivals in Salisbury as a biannual event occurring at the St Augustine's School premises. The first Parish Carnival happened in 2014. {  + !Salisbury Parish Priest !From !To !Comments - Fr Frederick Byrne 1869 1872  - Fr Charles Van Der Heyden 1872 1874  - Fr Charles Church 1877 1879  - Fr Edmund Phelan 1881 1883  - Fr Mark Delahunty 1883 1890  - Fr Thomas O'Neill 1890 1896  - Fr Aristide Gandolfi 1896   - Fr Francis O'Neill 1897 1914  - Fr Richard Morrison 1916 1926 approx. - Fr Frederick Charles Anthony Gatzmeyer 1926 1957 died in a car accident - Fr John O'Callaghan 1957 1964  - Fr William Bustelli 1964 1967  - Fr William Flanagan 1967 1974  - Dean Louis Travers 1974 1981  - Fr Hugh O'Sullivan 1981 1982  - Fr Robert Egar 1983 1990  - Fr Philip Marshall 1991 1997  - Fr James O'Loughlin 1998 2005  - Fr Roderick O¬¥Brien 2006 2018  - Fr Shibu Jacob MSFS 2018  - - - - currently } == Reference List == Category:Roman Catholic churches in South Australia Category:South Australian places listed on the defunct Register of the National Estate Category:South Australian Heritage Register ","title":"St Augustine's Church, Salisbury"},{"id":"56064176","text":"is a Japanese athlete.

Global Environment Centre, Kuala Lumpur and Wetlands International, Wageningen. p. 179 Available at http://www. imcg.net/media/download_gallery/books/assessment_peatland.pdf (Accessed 29 September 2017). == History of the Initiative == The Global Peatlands Initiative is an international partnership formed by 13 founding members at the UNFCCC COP in Marrakech, Morocco, in late 2016. Its goal is to protect and conserve peatlands as the world's largest terrestrial organic carbon stock. Since then, the Initiative has grown to 35 international organizations with four major tropical peatland countries: Indonesia, the Republic of Congo, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and Peru. Its members are working together to improve the conservation, restoration and sustainable management of peatlands globally. == Areas of work == The Global Peatlands Initiative conducts international activities and within four initial partner countries: Indonesia, Peru, Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and the Republic of Congo. The Initiative's global activities are developing an overall outlook on the extent, status and importance of peatlands. This includes a comprehensive picture of peatlands as a core asset in global efforts to mitigate climate change. Global activities include an broad assessment of peatlands' extent and carbon content, followed by a more detailed analysis of sustainable peatland management options, South-South-North cooperation and private sector engagement. Within the four initial partner countries, the activities focus on supporting a shift in management practices towards a more inclusive and sustainable approach, in order to maximize the contribution of peatlands management to efforts in addressing climate change. The pilot projects also support the transition to a Green economy. == Outcomes == In March 2018 and in an unprecedented move, the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), the Republic of Congo and Indonesia jointly signed the Brazzaville Declaration on Peatlands, to protect the Cuvette Centrale region in the Congo Basin ‚Äì the world's largest tropical peatlands ‚Äì from unregulated land use, and prevent its drainage and degradation. The declaration came as a result of the proceedings of the Third Global Peatlands Initiative meeting of the Partners, formalizing the commitment of the governments to continue to work together and exchange knowledge with the support of the Initiative to promote better management and conservation of this globally important carbon store. In October 2018, as a direct follow-up to the Brazzaville Declaration on Peatlands (signed during the 3rd meeting of the Global Peatlands Initiative partners in March 2018), partners and countries have been working together to mobilize political will and resources to protect the peatlands in the Congos and in the tropics. As a strong South-South exchange effort on peatlands knowledge, the Minister of Indonesia invited the Ministers of the two Congos and Peru as well as UN Environment to take part in a working week of peatland knowledge exchange. During the meeting, the Minister of the Republic of Congo and representative of Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) supported a joint declaration for the establishment of the International Tropical Peatland Centre (co-hosted by CIFOR) in Bogor. Indonesia and the Republic of Congo took their partnership one step further and signed a Memorandum of Understanding on Peatlands knowledge and experience sharing to solidify further collaboration. Draft Memoranda of Understanding also exist between Indonesia and Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and Indonesia and Peru on support to the Centre and for South-South collaboration. However, the Ministers did not travel to Indonesia and these agreements have not yet been signed. The United Nations Environment Programme organized on 11‚Äì15 March 2019 the fourth United Nations Environment Assembly in Nairobi (Kenya) where Indonesia led the negotiations on the first ever global resolution on peatlands ‚ÄúConservation and Sustainable Management of Peatlands‚Äù adopted with support of all countries. The resolution urges ‚ÄúMember States and other stakeholders to give greater emphasis to the conservation, sustainable management and restoration of peatlands worldwide‚Äù. == The partnership == The Initiative has grown to 35 international organizations with four major tropical peatland countries of Indonesia, Republic of Congo, Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and Peru. == Publications  Smoke on Water: Countering Global Threats from Peatlands Loss and Degradation === The Global Peatlands Initiative aims to help build an understanding of the rates, drivers and pathways of peatland ecosystem change. It aims to support countries in making well-informed decisions and to develop management and policy options that minimize impacts on people and the environment and avoid dangerous social and climatic tipping points linked to peatland loss and degradation ‚Äì such as toxic smoke and haze from peatland fires. As a first step in filling the information gap, the Initiative launched its first joint product in November 2017 ‚Äì Smoke On Water ‚Äì Countering Global Threats from Peatland Loss and Degradation. Smoke On Water shares key knowledge from the Initiative to explain both the need to and the opportunity to rapidly protect and restore peatlands.Crump, J. (Ed.) 2017. Smoke on Water ‚Äì Countering Global Threats From Peatland Loss and Degradation. A UNEP Rapid Response Assessment. United Nations Environment Programme and GRID-Arendal, Nairobi and Arendal, www.grida.no === Frontiers 2018/19: Emerging Issues of Environmental Concern === The Global Peatlands Initiative co-wrote a chapter the UN Environments‚Äô publication: Frontiers 2018/19: Emerging Issues of Environmental Concern launched in March 2019. This chapter: Permafrost Peatlands: Losing Ground in a Warming World, highlights the importance of peatlands on permafrost as a critical carbon-rich biome with their management having far reaching implications on the climate. Indeed, with rising global temperatures, the Arctic is warming twice as fast as the global average and scientists are becoming increasingly alarmed at the accelerating rate of permafrost thaw. Permafrost thaw is now seen as one of the most urgent issues to address as it could precipitate a runaway greenhouse effect if left unabated.UNEP (2019). Frontiers 2018/19 Emerging Issues of Environmental concern. United Nations Environment Programme, Nairobi === To come: Global Peatlands Assessment === The publication's objective is to share the evidence base on how the protection of peatlands can contribute to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals, to inform policy across the hotspots of peatland degradation. The premise is that better information will lead to better decision-making, by national governments, private sector actors and donors. It aims to assess and communicate the status and value of peatlands and the practical opportunities to restore and protect them. The results of this authoritative global assessment will be organized by region, so that it is easy to find a geographical area of interest. It also draws attention to other peatland values under pressure. The assessment will incorporate a Global Hotspots Atlas, illustrating the best available data on peatland state, trends and pressures, and produced by the Greifswald Mire Centre. Through novel analyses, the assessment will identify the biodiversity value and protection status of peatlands in each region and hence their contribution to the Sustainable Development Goal for Life on Land. It will emphasize the need for positive action and show case studies of successful and promising approaches to peatland protection and restoration that can co-exist with economic growth. == See also == * United Nations Environment Programme (UN Environment) * Global Landscapes Forum (GLF) == References  External links == * Global Peatlands Initiative Category:United Nations Environment Programme Category:2016 establishments in Kenya Category:2016 in the environment Category:Peat ","title":"Global Peatlands Initiative"},{"id":"56064232","text":"XTVN (X Total Variety Network; stylized as XtvN) is a new South Korean TV channel, owned by CJ ENM E&M; Division.

Lindberg was the second of three boys in the family. St. Petersburg thus became his home town, a fact that was to influence his career. The family moved to Helsinki, Grand Duchy of Finland in the early 1890s after his father had been offered a position as the Director of Technology in a recently founded company Kone ja Silta Oy (literally, Machine & Bridge, today W√§rtsil√§ Corporation). In 1903, at the age of 19, Lindberg matriculated from the Swedish speaking Real Lyceum in Helsinki. After preparatory studies for three years in botany, zoology, physics and chemistry in the Imperial Alexander University in Finland, he passed the medicophile examination, a mandatory step before applying to the Faculty of Medicine. He graduated in 1914 as Licentiate of Medicine. By that time, he had made up his mind to become an ophthalmologist after having frequently assisted during his university years in a private eye hospital in Helsinki, run by Johannes Silfvast (1867‚Äì1932). == Specialization== Lindberg spent the rest of 1914 working as an intern at the Department of Surgery in Maria Municipal Hospital, Helsinki, and as a voluntary unpaid resident in the Helsinki University Eye Hospital. After mastering the basics, he enrolled in 1915 to the Imperial Ophthalmic Hospital in St. Petersburg. He also worked as a general practitioner. All professors in the Imperial Ophthalmic Hospital before the Russian Revolution of 1917 were of German origin. During Lindberg's residency, the chair was Ernst Friedrich Blessig (1859‚Äì1940). The main research interests of Blessig were glaucoma and eye injuries. He proposed that Lindberg would explore the theory put forward two years earlier by Karl Theodor Paul Polykarpus Axenfeld (1867‚Äì1930) in Freiburg, Germany, according to which pigmentation of the iris would decrease and its transparency increase with the development of cataract. Lindberg started his research in 1915. Lindberg needed a slit lamp but this instrument was not yet commercially available. The theory behind a slit lamp had been presented by Nobel laureate Allvar Gullstrand (1862‚Äì1930) 4 years earlier. Lindberg consulted publications of Gullstrand, got hold of an old Zeiss microscope, and built his own slit lamp. The material of the thesis consisted of 202 patients older than 55 years from the Imperial Ophthalmic Hospital, although some control patients were enrolled from the Kivel√§ Municipal Hospital and Oulunkyl√§ Old People's Home, both in Helsinki, Finland. Lindberg made detailed drawings of the iris and lens as no photographic technique was yet available. While examining his patients, he found that many of them had small whitish flakes on the lens and the pupillary border of the iris. He grew interested in this unexpected observation. Eventually, such white flakes could be seen in one half of his glaucoma patients and they also were frequent in eyes with cataract. He noted an association with advancing age. Lindberg wrote his doctoral thesis in Swedish and entitled it (as translated to English) \\"Clinical Investigations on Depigmentation of the Pupillary Border and the Translucency of the Iris in Cases of Senile Cataract and in Normal Eyes of Elderly Persons\\". He defended it on May 30, 2017. Because the thesis was written in the Imperial Ophthalmic Hospital, his opponent was V√§in√∂ Gr√∂nholm (1868-1939) from the Imperial Alexander University in Finland where the thesis also was defended. The thesis fulfilled the academic requirements for the title of Doctor in Medical Sciences. == Escape from Russian Revolution == The increasing tumult of World War I (1914‚Äì1917) brought the young family to Helsinki in 1917 after the February Revolution broke out following significant military setbacks for the Russian Army. On 6 December 1917, Finland separated from Russia and declared independence as a Republic. Lindberg first briefly practiced in the Eye Clinic of the Deaconess‚Äô Hospital in Vyborg, Eastern Finland. He then took a voluntary appointment as Resident ophthalmologist in the University Eye Hospital in Helsinki and held this position until 1920. He already was a licensed specialist in Ophthalmology but considered the appointment useful to get a comprehensive training in every subspecialty of ophthalmology. Although travelling abroad in the 1920s was expensive, slow and tedious, Lindberg visited in 1920 to the University of Freiburg, Germany, where he practiced science at its Department of Ophthalmology for one year and took part in clinical work under the guidance of Axenfeld. He returned later to Freiburg in 1923 to pursue studies in naphthalene cataract. He also became a regular participant in the annual meeting of the Deutsche Ophthalmologische Gesellschaft (German Ophthalmological Society) in Heidelberg. While in Germany, Lindberg met Alfred Vogt (1879‚Äì1943) from the University of Basel in Switzerland and gave him a copy of his thesis. In 1923, Vogt published about exfoliation syndrome without mentioning Lindberg. Vogt proposed that exfoliation was a consequence of prior surgery for glaucoma, but this was an error. After becoming Professor in Ophthalmology in the University of Z√ºrich, Vogt undertook original research in exfoliation syndrome and became widely known in the United States, so that exfoliation syndrome was known there as Vogt's syndrome even decades later. In 1921, Lindberg attended for the first time the Nordic Congress of Ophthalmology in Stockholm, Sweden, and met Birger Malling (1884‚Äì1989) from Troms√∏, Norway, who also was briefed about the thesis. Malling also published about exfoliation syndrome in 1923 without mentioning Lindberg. He erred in concluding that exfoliation resulted from iridocyclitis. == Later career == After returning to Finland in 1923, Lindberg moved his family for three years to Vyborg where he got an appointment as the Chief Physician of a private eye hospital. He was the only ophthalmologist in the Karelian Isthmus, and the first specialist in that hospital who had any research background. The inhabitants of Karelia were plagued by trachoma and eye injuries were common. No antibiotics or sulfonamides were available so that trachoma was mostly managed by everting the eyelids and rupturing the granules, as well as by topical silver nitrate and zinc sulfate, which was time-consuming. Lindberg kept detailed statistics. In 1929, Lindberg got an appointment in the University of Helsinki as Clinical Instructor for four years, and he founded in the city a private practice that he ran for almost 40 years. He also worked as an ophthalmologist in the Central Military Hospital. The City of Helsinki maintained an eye casualty that was attached to the Department of Surgery at Maria Municipal Hospital. In 1935, Lindberg got an appointment as its Chief Physician. He was a frequent speaker in both domestic and international congresses. When the State of Finland in 1937 failed to fulfill a promise to develop a new building for the University Eye Hospital, the city founded an own Department of Ophthalmology in the Kivel√§ Municipal Hospital, and Lindberg became its Chief Physician, a position from which he retired in 1951. Lindberg also functioned as the President of Finska L√§kares√§llskapet (the Swedish-speaking Medical Society in Finland), was two times the President of the Ophthalmological Society of Finland, and a member in several committees of the Finnish Medical Association. == Influence on research in exfoliation syndrome == Knowledge of exfoliation syndrome remained very limited among ophthalmologists throughout the 1920s and 1930s. Archimede Busacca (1893‚Äì1971) became the first to study the histopathology of exfoliation syndrome in Italy in 1927. In 1937, Eivind H√∏rven (1896‚Äì1985), a Norwegian ophthalmologist from the University of Oslo, cited Lindberg's thesis in his paper in the British Journal of Ophthalmology and credited him as the discoverer of exfoliation syndrome. Lindberg's role was highlighted by Ahti Tarkkanen from University of Helsinki in the second thesis about exfoliation syndrome ‚ÄúPseudoexfoliation of the Lens Capsule. A Clinical Study of 418 Patients with Special Reference to Glaucoma, Cataract, and Changes of the Vitreous‚Äù published in 1962. In 1989, Tarkkanen and Henrik Forsius from University of Oulu, Finland, published an English translation of Lindberg's thesis as a supplement to Acta Ophthalmologica, so as to make it widely available to researchers. The 1st International Workshop on Exfoliation Syndrome was held in 1987 in Helsinki, Finland, followed by the 2nd in 1992 in Genoa, Italy, and the 3rd in 1995 in Erlangen, Germany. These were followed by informal Think Tanks organized in New York by Robert Ritch from 1999 onward. In 1998, an international society for investigators sharing an interest in exfoliation syndrome was founded. It adopted the name ‚ÄúThe Lindberg Society‚Äù, and has since met regularly across the world. == Personal life == On April 1, 1913, Lindberg married Lilla Elisabeth Fazer, daughter of the Consul General Konrad Georg Fazer and Jeanne Barrault. Lilla was to help John as his research assistant, copy typist and assisting nurse. Their first child Wanda Elisabeth was born in 1914, followed by Roger in 1915, and Konrad in 1918. ==References Category:1884 births Category:1973 deaths Category:Finnish ophthalmologists Category:19th-century physicians Category:Finnish scientists Category:19th-century Finnish people Category:People from Helsinki Category:University of Helsinki alumni Category:Swedish-speaking Finns ","title":"John G.

He served as the first treasurer of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). Milholland was an editor at the New-York Tribune for twelve years. His company spearheaded work on early pneumatic tubes in New York City. == Biography == John Elmer Milholland was born in Lewis, New York on May 20, 1860 to John and Mary Moore Milholland. His parents were Irish immigrants, and when he was three their house burned down. His mother and sister were killed, and his father returned with Milholland to Ireland. After two years, Milholland returned to America, where his father opened a confectioners shop. Educated at Paterson High School, Milholland was aided by William Walter Phelps and attended New York University. After two years, he dropped out and became a journalist, working for the Ticonderoga Sentinel, which he eventually bought. Milholland subsequently sold the paper and was employed by the New York Tribune, where he reached chief editorial writer. Milholland's friend Harry Reid urged Benjamin Harrison to appoint Milholland as chief inspector of immigration for the Port of New York. Reid was nominated for vice president, in large part through the work of Milholland, for which he was named assistant secretary of the National Republican Party. Milholland soon destroyed his political career by campaigning against Tammany Hall politicians. He also invested in the Batcheller Pneumatic Tube Co., eventually becoming its president. The corporation worked on the first pneumatic tube lines in New York City (see Pneumatic tube mail in New York City). Expanding into other markets, by 1900, Milholland was worth $500,000. An antiexpansionist, Milholland soon moved to London, where he founded the International Union Club, which supported the Boers. In 1904, he created a syndicate that controlled much of the pneumatic mail in Europe. He used the large amounts of money he earned to fund several civil-rights activists, first Booker T. Washington, and later W. E. B. Du Bois. Milholland was criticized for these donations, and was soon removed from the board of the corporation. He then expanded his funding of civil rights, funding Mary Ovington, and investing in Phipps Houses; as well as helping to organize the Constitution League, a forerunner of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). \\"The NAACP was founded in part because of Milholland's financial support of Ovington, as she used the money he gave her to travel and recruit people to answer \\"the Call\\" to create the NAACP. Milholland was the NAACP's first treasurer.\\" Milholland married Jean Torrey, and had three children, Vida, John and Inez Milholland. Vida and Inez were both notable women's rights activists. In 1911, he attended the First Universal Races Congress. He died on June 29, 1925, at his home on 247 Fifth Avenue, after a short illness. In February 1928, a bust of Milholland was unveiled at the Norman School in Pennsylvania. A bust to him was also erected at Howard University. == References == Category:1860 births Category:1925 deaths Category:New York (state) National Republicans ","title":"John Milholland"},{"id":"56064302","text":"Kƒ±sƒ±klƒ± is an underground station on the M5 line of the Istanbul Metro in east √úsk√ºdar.

In a brief racing career which lasted from July 1982 until July 1983 he won three of his five races. After winning on his first appearance he won the National Stakes on his second and final start of the year. In 1983 he finished second on his seasonal debut and rebounded from a poor run at Royal Ascot to win the Prix Daphnis. He stood as a breeding stallion in Ireland, Hungary and the Czech Republic and had some success as a sire of winners before dying in 2007 at the age of twenty-seven. ==Background== Glenstal was a \\"medium-sized, attractive\\" bay horse with no white markings bred in Kentucky by his owner, Robert Sangster's Swettenham Stud. He was sent to race in Europe where he entered training with Vincent O'Brien at Ballydoyle. He was sired by the Canadian-bred Northern Dancer who won the Kentucky Derby in 1964 and went on to become an exceptionally successful and influential breeding stallion. Glenstal was the second foal of his dam Cloonlara, a top-class performer who was rated the best two-year-old filly in Europe in 1976. Cloonlara's dam Fish Bar produced several other winners including the leading miler Kings Lake, to whom Glenstal bore a striking resemblance. Fish Bar herself was a granddaughter of the 1000 Guineas and St Leger Stakes winner Herringbone, whose other descendants included Moon Madness, Celtic Swing and Michelozzo. ==Racing career1982: two-year-old season=== Glenstal made his debut in a maiden race over six furlongs at the Curragh in July and won by a short head from the John Oxx-trained Najran. The form of the race was subsequently boosted when Najran ran third to Sweet Emma in the Group 1 Phoenix Stakes. In September the colt was stepped up in class for the Group 2 National Stakes over seven furlongs at the Curragh in which he was partnered by Vincent Rossiter, a veteran jockey who was by that time mainly employed as a work-rider at Ballydoyle. Glenstal was very much Vincent O'Brien's \\"second string\\", starting at odds of 14/1 whilst his stablemate Lomond went off the 2/7 favourite, with the best-fancied of the other seven runners being the Kevin Prendergast-trained Burslem. After tracking the leaders in the early stages, Glenstal made progress in the last quarter mile, went to the front inside the final furlong and won \\"a shade comfortably\\" by a length and a short head from Burslem and Lomond. In the official International Classification for 1982, Glenstal was rated the third-best juvenile colt in Ireland behind his stablemates Danzatore and Caerleon. The independent Timeform organisation gave him a rating of 112p (the \\"p\\" indicating that he was expected to make more than the usual improvement) making him 21 pounds inferior to their best two-year-old Diesis. ===1983: three-year-old season=== On his first appearance of 1983, Glenstal was dropped back to sprint distances for a six furlong event at Phoenix Park Racecourse in April but went down by a head to Sir Prince John after what Timeform described as a \\"ding-dong battle\\". He was sent to England in June for the St James's Palace Stakes at Royal Ascot but after becoming upset in the starting stalls he never looked likely to win and came home sixth of the seven runners. In the following month the colt was sent to France to contest the Prix Daphnis over 1400 metres at Evry Racecourse in what proved to be his final race. Ridden by Yves Saint-Martin, he led from the start, accelerated just after half-way and held off a late challenge from Luderic to win by a short neck. He never raced again and was retired to stud at the end of the season. ==Stud record== Glenstal was retired from racing to become a breeding stallion at the Longfield Stud in County Tipperary, standing at an initial fee of 20,000 Irish guineas. He moved to Hungary in 1993 and then to the Czech Republic in 2001. He was pensioned from stud duty in 2005 and died of a heart attack on 6 October 2007. The best of Glenstal's offspring included Las Meninas, Candy Glen (Premio Parioli) and Glen Kate (Monrovia Stakes). He also had considerable success as a National Hunt stallion, with his best winners over jumps including the Ladbroke Hurdle winner Glencloud and the mare Deb's Ball who won 15 races including the West Yorkshire Hurdle and foaled the Betfred Gold Cup winner Hot Weld. ==PedigreeReferences== Category:1980 racehorse births Category:2007 racehorse deaths Category:Racehorses bred in Kentucky Category:Racehorses trained in Ireland Category:Thoroughbred family 8-c ","title":"Glenstal (horse)"},{"id":"56064325","text":"Washington Street facade The Washington Street School is a historic school building at 461 Washington Street in Hartford, Connecticut. Built in stages between 1874 and 1929, it is a good example of Romanesque architecture, and is reflective of the rapid growth on Hartford's south side. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. It has been converted into senior housing. ==Description and history== The Washington Street School is located in south Hartford's Barry Square neighborhood, occupying a roughly rectangular parcel bounded on the north by School Street, the east by Washington Street, and the south by New Britain Avenue. It consists of a series of brick and brownstone buildings, all two stories in height, connected in a rough U shape, with the legs of the U extending parallel to School Street. The main facade faces New Britain Avenue, which extends south westerly from Washington Street at an angle. Although they were built over a long period of time, the various sections of the building have a relatively unified Romanesque appearance, with arched brownstone entrances and occasional round- arch windows. The first school to stand on this site was built in 1842, when a one-room schoolhouse was built here. By the 1860s it was significantly overcrowded, but a new school was not built until 1874. A portion of this building is contained within the surviving structure. It was repeatedly enlarged, in 1890, 1895, 1899, 1906, 1917, and 1929. During this entire period, the school remained a district school, and was taken over by city administration when all schools were finally consolidated in 1934. In 1958 it was formally named the Michael D. Fox Elementary School, after a long-time principal and administrator. It had been vacated by the time of its listing on the National Register in 1982, and has since been converted into senior housing. ==See also== *National Register of Historic Places listings in Hartford, Connecticut ==References== Category:School buildings on the National Register of Historic Places in Connecticut Category:National Register of Historic Places in Hartford, Connecticut Category:Romanesque Revival architecture in Connecticut Category:Renaissance Revival architecture in Connecticut Category:School buildings completed in 1874 Category:Buildings and structures in Hartford, Connecticut ","title":"Washington Street School (Hartford, Connecticut)"},{"id":"56064346","text":"Mongolia competed at the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea, from 9 to 25 February 2018.

When he was twelve, Carr won a scholarship to Scoil √âanna in County Galway, an Irish- language school which specialised in preparing students for teacher training. He then went to St Patrick's College of Education in Dublin, where he led an unofficial student social committee, organising dances and performances by bands ‚Äì including Phil Lynott. At one of these dances, he met his future wife, Joan. He also set up a poker club with Joe O'Toole, which was still running forty years later. ==CareerTeaching=== On graduating as a teacher, Carr found work at Scoil Eoin Baiste in Clontarf, where he worked for 22 years. He was the first male teacher in its infants section, and was soon promoted to become the school's principal. During this period, he was active in the Teachers' Club in Dublin, and in the 1980s remortgaged his house to keep it running. In his spare time, he worked as a DJ, a job the Sunday World campaigned against as inappropriate for a principal. ===Union=== In 1989, Carr became the full-time assistant general secretary of the Irish National Teachers' Organisation (INTO), then its general treasurer in 1997, and in 2001 its general secretary. Under his leadership, the union successfully encouraged the formation of various structures to counter educational disadvantage, including the National Council for Special Education, the DEIS initiative, the Teaching Council and the Statutory Committee on Educational Disadvantage. Carr stood down from his trade union post in 2010. ===Recognition=== Carr was named Donegal Person of the Year in 2009. ==References== Category:1940s births Category:Living people Category:Irish trade unionists Category:People from County Donegal ","title":"John Carr (trade unionist)"},{"id":"56064424","text":"GhiyƒÅth al-Din Mansur Dashtaki (1461-1542) was an Iranian Safavid Islamic philosopher, the son of Sadr ad-Din Dashtaki.

It is responsible for defending their rights and ensuring the interests of sex workers. It is affiliated with the CTA (Central de Trabajadores Argentinos). In 1997 it became part of the Network of Women Sex Workers from Latin America and the Caribbean (RedTraSex). Among its demands is the decriminalization of abortion. ==HistoryBeginning=== The organization was founded and incorporated in March 1995 to the Central de los Trabajadores Argentinos. The Embassy of the Netherlands in the city of Buenos Aires contributed to the installation of the office that the union currently has within the building of the CTA. In the international arena, starting in 1997 and on the basis of contacts with different organizations nearby, the Sexual Workers Network of Latin America and the Caribbean was created; In it, organizations and focal points of the different countries of the continent are articulated. Elena Reynaga, as representative of Ammar, chairs this network. Ammar's action contributed to the repeal of police edicts and the decriminalization of street prostitution in the city of Buenos Aires for a brief period, until the reform of Article 71 of the Contraventional Code on March 4, 1999, which again sanctioned the offer of sex on public roads in certain cases. ===The murder of Sandra Cabrera=== On January 27, 2004, Sandra Cabrera, general secretary of AMMAR in Rosario, was murdered. Cabrera had filed complaints against some local police officers, accusing them of corruption and asking for money from local sex workers in exchange for letting them work. For this reason she received threats, both against her and her daughter. In November 2003 she was brutally beaten inside her home and threatened to stop reporting. She was shot in the head two months after. Her body was found near the bus terminal in Rosario. ===Present=== In 2003, Elena Reynaga, Secretary General of Ammar, was in charge of closing the \\"II Meeting on HIV / AIDS in Latin America and the Caribbean,\\" which was held in Cuba. Currently, the union has representation in more than half of the provinces of Argentina and its General Secretary is Georgina Orellano. In March 2015, the Contraventional and Misdemeanor Criminal Justice of the City of Buenos Aires, with the ruling of Court No. 8 by Dr. Natalia Molina, recognized sex work as an illegal activity, condemned the prosecution of sex workers and urged the government to regulate the activity. In 2013, Ammar commissioned the advertising agency Ogilvy & Mather to produce a series of advertisements in the form of street art. The campaign was named \\"Corners\\". The advertisements were placed on street corners. One side wall showed sexualized woman, the other women with children. On the side with children were the words 86 percent of sex workers are mothers. We need a law to regulate our work. ==References *Official website Category:1994 establishments in Argentina Category:Sex industry in Argentina Category:Sex worker organizations in Argentina ","title":"Association of Women Sex Workers in Argentina in Action for Our Rights"},{"id":"56064613","text":"The Laryan narrow-gauge railway (') is located in Leningrad Oblast, Russia.

The event, organized by the Entertainment Software Association (ESA), took place at the Los Angeles Convention Center from June 12‚Äì14, 2018, with many companies holding press conferences in the days prior. With the industry still in the middle of the eighth generation of video game consoles, no new hardware was introduced, and publishers and developers principally focused on new games to be released in 2018 and beyond. The event drew 69,200 attendees, the largest since 2005. == Format and changes == E3 2018 took place from June 12 to 14, 2018 in the Los Angeles Convention Center. In the days prior, major publishers hold press conferences, typically as a live presentation in a large theater with streaming broadcast, or through streaming pre-recorded segments, highlighting the new games that are planned for the next year. During the show proper, developers and publishers run exhibition booths to allow industry members, the press, retail representatives, and the public to try out the new games and talk with the creators. Several side events were also held in nearby venues, including video game tournaments. Like the previous year, E3 2018 offered public access passes to the event, following from its first such offering during E3 2017. However, to address issues with over-crowding in the exhibitor halls, E3 2018 was open on two days with industry-only access for a few hours before permitting public access to the exhibitors. Only those with complimentary industry passes and publicly purchasable business passes were able to take part in these exclusive hours. 1,000 of the public passes, called \\"Gamer Passes\\" were sold at US$149 with the rest of the public passes being sold for $249 on a first-come‚Äìfirst-served basis. Those passes, as well as the business passes went on sale on February 12, 2018. == Press conferences  Electronic Arts === Electronic Arts ran a separate event near the Convention Center, rather than participating at the Expo.

The return journey left Aberdeen at 7:35pm, and arrived in King's Cross 11 hours 50 minutes later.

After an engine change and airframe modifications it became one of the Silesian Aeroclubs fleet. It was lost in a take-off accident in 1931 and was the last Silesia aircraft to fly. ==Design and development== Three brothers, Edward, Paul and Wojciech Sopora set up an aircraft-building workshop in 1923 at Chorz√≥w, calling it the Pierwsza ≈ölƒÖska Fabryka Samolot√≥w (First Silesian Aircraft Factory). Their first product was the 1923 Silesia S-3. Though their next aircraft, the 1925 Silesia S-4, was also a low-powered, single seat monoplane like the S-3, It was a parasol wing type of more refined design. The wing, with a rectangular plan and a thin aerofoil section, was a one piece, wooden structure built around two spars and fabric-covered. It was braced on each side with a parallel pair of struts to the spars from the lower fuselage longerons. An unusual pyramid of long struts on each side from the mid and lower fuselage braced the forward spar centrally and an inverted V-strut aft joined the upper fuselage longerons and rear spar. The wing had a large, deep cut-out in the central trailing edge which eased cockpit access, as the wing was not far above the fuselage. The S-4 was at first powered by the same air- cooled Haacke HFM-2 flat twin engine used by the S-3. Behind it the fuselage was rectangular in section and flat-sided. The forward part was a fabric- covered steel tube structure but behind the cockpit, just ahead of the trailing edge, wood frames and plywood covering were used. Its empennage was wood-framed, wire-braced and fabric-covered, with the tailplane on top of the fuselage and a fin with a short, balanced rudder. Its fixed, tailskid undercarriage was similar to that of the S-3, with large mainwheels on a single axle supported at each end by V-struts from the lower longerons. The first flight, piloted by Klosek, was in June 1925. It was soon busy, giving a demonstration to representatives of an infantry regiment and taking part in a series of publicity flights to Silesian towns during a L.O.P.P air-awareness week. It also made a flight from Michaj≈Çowice to ≈öwiƒôtoch≈Çowice. It was later moved to Katowice, the home of the Silesian Pilots' Club where it was thoroughly tested by two Polskie Linie Lotnicze 'Lot' (Polish Airways 'Flight') pilots who found its handling poor and attributed this partly to the elderly, low-powered Haacke engine. These observations led to the installation of a slightly more powerful () three cylinder Anzani engine. The wing bracing was tidied, with the original diagonal wire bracing of the main wing struts replaced by a rigid strut and the central, forward stuts replaced by a neater transverse V-strut from the upper longerons, making a more conventional cabane. The vertical tail was also modified, with a more rounded rudder with a smaller balance horn. ==Operational history== After these modifications the S-4 was much flown by members of the Silesian Pilots' Club and when in 1930 this club became part of the Silesian Aeroclub, the S-4 was one of the eight aircraft in its fleet. It was destroyed in June 1931 when a club member fatally stalled after an unauthorised take-off. This crash had unhappy consequences for the Sopara brothers. Encouraged by the interest of the club fliers in the S-4, they had designed a , two seat, aerobatic training and touring aircraft, the Silesia S-10, the construction of which was funded by the Silesian Aeroclub. At the time of the S-4 crash the S-10 was complete but awaiting its German engine. The crash ended the club's interest in the S-10 and with it the Pierwsza ≈ölƒÖska Fabryka Samolot√≥w; the S-4 was their last design to fly. ==Operators == * Silesian Pilots' Club * Silesian Aeroclub ==Specifications (Haacke engine) References== Category:Single-engined tractor aircraft Category:Parasol-wing aircraft Category:1920s Polish sport aircraft S-04 ","title":"Silesia S-4"},{"id":"56064848","text":"Michael Poettoz (born August 21, 1998)FIS Profile is an alpine skier representing Colombia.

Reihana. The soundtrack, released in 2004, features 7 tracks with lyrics written by Kalaikumar, Kabilan and Annamalai. The soundtrack received below average reviews upon release. Malathi Rangarajan of The Hindu stated, \\"A. R. Rehana's music in Machi is only an aural intrusion\\". Another critic said, \\"None of the songs make a mark\\".

Newcomer Subha Punja is there for songs and dances and is too skinny to be a Tamil heroine. Pasupathy as the villain hams outrageously, very similar to his character in the recent Arul. On the whole Machi is entertaining and has a message on friendship\\". Malathi Rangarajan of The Hindu wrote, \\"Racy, thrilling and suspenseful for the most part, Machi, despite certain snags, comes as a surprise\\". Indiaglitz labelled the film as \\"fast paced action entertainer\\" and praised the cinematographer R. Madhi's camera work. Another reviewer stated \\"This is a movie that is in dire need of some editing. Many of the scenes are long drawn-out and test our patience\\" and added \\"Dushyanth shows some improvement from his debut Success but not enough to mark him as a hero of promise\\". ==References== Category:2004 films Category:Indian films Category:Tamil-language films Category:2000s Tamil-language films Category:Indian action films Category:Films shot in Coimbatore Category:2004 directorial debut films Category:2004 action films ","title":"Machi (film)"},{"id":"56064912","text":"The 2018 Cork Senior Football Championship was the 130th staging of the Cork Senior Football Championship since its establishment by the Cork County Board in 1887.

This lake extends entirely into the townships of Brongniart and Rasles. Forestry is the main economic activity of the sector. Recreational tourism activities come second. The Eastern part of the \\"Eau Jaune Lake\\" hydrographic slope is accessible by a forest road from the North separating from route 113 which runs East-West to the North of the lake along the Canadian National Railway. The surface of the \\"Eau Jaune Lake\\" is usually frozen from early November to mid-May, however, safe ice circulation is generally from mid-November to mid-April. == Geography Toponymy== This hydronym was reported in 1916 in minutes of the Quebec Geography Commission. Presumably, this descriptive toponym borrows its name from the color of water. In 1900, explorer Henry O'Sullivan, who mapped this lake without naming it, indicated that the surrounding soil contained ferrous deposits.Source: Names and places in Quebec, published by the \\"Commission de toponymie du Qu√©bec\\" in 1994 and 1996 as a printed illustrated dictionary, and as a CD-ROM produced by of this dictionary.

According to Andron of Halicarnassus, the founders of these cities were coming from an area that was also called Doris, in Thessaly, and that was also called Histiaeotis. It is described by Strabo as lying below the town of Pindus; it probably stood upon the river of the latter name. Recounting the ships in the Battle of Salamis, Herodotus notes the contingents of the Peloponnese, saying that the Dorians and Macedonians were originally from Pindus, Erineus, and Dryopis. Thucydides writes that during First Peloponnesian War, about the year 458 or 457 BCE, the Phocians attacked the cities of Boium, Erineus and Cytinium in Doris. The Lacedemonians came to their defense, with troops commanded by Nicomedes of Sparta and forced the Phocians to retreat.

She became well known the German Democratic Republic (East Germany) as a marriage and relationship counsellor. == Life == Jutta Treuwerth was born in the Tiergarten quarter of north-central Berlin during the first part of the war. She was bought up by her grandparents in Berlin-Lichtenberg. As was normal in East Germany at this time, on leaving school she was required to spend a year in industry - in her case employed in the brown coal industry in Lusatia \\\\- before progressing to a year's internship at Junge Welt, the daily newspaper that had become the official publication of the FDJ - which was in effect the youth wing of East Germany's ruling Socialist Unity Party (\\"Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands\\" / SED). After that she studied journalism at the prestigious Journalism Academy in Leipzig. On completing her studies she returned to Junge Welt in Berlin, appointed a full-time member of the editorial team in 1965. Two years later her head of department, Brigitte Zimmermann, commended the way her young colleague could prepare \\"publication- ready text\\" completely on her own, demonstrating an outstanding ability to think through readers' problems through the eyes of the readers themselves. In 1971 she took over the newspaper's \\"Unter vier Augen\\" (literally: Under four eyes) column, becoming in effect what the English term a \\"newspaper agony aunt\\", answering reader questions about sex and associated relationship issues. It is believed that between 1971 and 1992 she dealt with approximately 22,000 readers' questions.Frau Doktor Sommer der DDR; in: Berliner Zeitung, 19 February 2015, p. 25. Hormonally based contraception pills had recently become available at no cost through health insurance, while in East Germany (in contrast to West Germany) it had also become possible to have legal abortions up to the third month of pregnancy. In the east as in the west, questions which for previous generations would frequently have been answered with a simple \\"no\\" from the grown ups, now frequently triggered more nuanced answers, and there is a real sense that for a new generation of teenagers and young adults Jutta Resch-Treuwerth was as influential as anyone in setting behavioural parameters. She lived long enough to see her own entry in an early (German) version of Wikipedia in which, she reported, it had been stated that she was \\"very close\\" to the East German Ministry of Education. She strenuously denied this, insisting that her \\"contributions\\" often \\"went too far\\" for the ministry, and that ministry officials, where they expressed opinions, would have preferred that sex education be left to schools and teachers. Nevertheless, the fact that she ran the column for twenty years, during which time Junge Welt continued to enjoy the support of the authorities, indicates that her advice column was not completely unacceptable to the old men in the politburo. The target readership initially was the cohort aged between roughly 14 and 25, but during her time running the \\"Unter vier Augen\\" column the average age of readers submitting questions increased, so that by 1992 plenty of the letters came from people well over 30. From the mid-1980s Jutta Resch- Treuwerth was also running her own advisory service covering marriage and family matters at her base in Hohen Neuendorf near Berlin. After her work with Junge Welt ended (at least for a time), this would become her principal professional focus. After the changes which turned out to be a prelude to reunification in 1990, Resch-Treuwerth left Junge Welt in 1992 and launched herself as a freelance counsellor, working for various media outlets. In 1996 she set up a dating agency in Hohen Neuendorf. She worked as a moderator on a family advice show entitled - predictably - \\"Unter vier Augen\\" produced by the regional broadcaster \\"Ruppin Prignitz TV\\" and she wrote as a guest columnist for various regional newspapers. Finally, in March 2013, she returned to Junge Welt as a regular columnist, her contributions appearing under the headline \\"Unter vier Augen\\". During the final part of her life Jutta Resch-Treuwerth suffered from cancer. She died in a Lauchhammer hospital in February 2015. == Publication (selection) == * 1982: Leben zu Zweit, Verlag Neues Leben. * 1986: Verliebt, verlobt, verheiratet , Verlag Neues Leben. * 1986: Ich hab dich lieb ‚Äì Briefgeschichten, Verlag Junge Welt, . * 1987: Vierzehn geworden, Verlag Neues Leben, . * 2001: Unter vier Augen, Schwarzkopf & Schwarzkopf * 2011: Warum denn nicht, Verlag Neues Leben, . == Awards and honours == * 1981 Patriotic Order of Merit in bronzeBerliner Zeitung, 6 October 1981, p. 5. ==References== Category:1941 births Category:2015 deaths Category:Writers from Berlin Category:East German journalists Category:East German writers Category:German sex educators Category:Leipzig University alumni Category:Recipients of the Patriotic Order of Merit in bronze ","title":"Jutta Resch-Treuwerth"},{"id":"56065045","text":"The Bristol Pullman was a named passenger train operating in the United Kingdom. ==History== The Bristol Pullman was introduced by British Railways on 12 September 1960.

Built in 1939, it is a well- preserved period stone-arch bridge, built with funding from a New Deal jobs program. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1999. ==Description and history== Bridge No. 63-016-150 is located in rural northern Turner County, carrying 272nd Street over an unnamed stream, between 453rd Avenue and South Dakota Highway 19. It is a two-arch stone structure, with a total length of about . Its two arches are segmental, with a span of , and rise about above the grade. The bridge has stone wing walls, which rise to low parapets that serve as curbing for the roadway. The bridge is fashioned out of locally quarried fieldstone, most of which is roughly cut and randomly laid. The finished surfaces have been trimmed and squared. This bridge is one of 180 stone arch bridges built in Turner County as part of a New Deal-era federal jobs program, the Federal Emergency Relief Administration (FERA). The county administration was able to build stone bridges at a lower cost than then- conventional steel beam bridges because of the availability of experienced stone workers, and the federal subsidy to the wages they were paid. The county was responsible for supervising the work crews and providing the building materials. This bridge was built in 1935 by a county crew to a standardized state design. It is one of only two bridges in the county built with FERA funding; others were built with later Works Progress Administration funds. ==See also== *National Register of Historic Places listings in Turner County, South Dakota *List of bridges on the National Register of Historic Places in South Dakota ==References== Category:Bridges on the National Register of Historic Places in South Dakota Category:National Register of Historic Places in Turner County, South Dakota Category:Bridges completed in 1939 Category:Transportation in Turner County, South Dakota Category:Buildings and structures in Turner County, South Dakota ","title":"South Dakota Department of Transportation Bridge No. 63-132-040"},{"id":"56065055","text":"Thirumudivakkam is a south-western suburb of Chennai metropolitan city, Tamil Nadu.

The district is mandated to return a single member to the for the Legislative Assembly of Alberta. The district has existed twice: the first iteration was represented in the Assembly from 1963 until 1997, and the district will be contested again in the next Alberta general election. ==HistoryBoundary history=== The district was created in 1963 from Taber and Warner, although not including the section of Taber to the north of the Old Man River. Its boundaries saw minor adjustments over the years, but always contained the communities of Taber, Warner, and Coaldale, stretching east from the City of Lethbridge and south to the Montana border. The district became a flashpoint of controversy in 1994, when the Alberta Court of Appeal heavily criticized the new map of electoral boundaries drawn up by a committee of PC MLAs led by Bob Bogle. The Court noted that ‚Äúone of the smallest divisions in the province...was that for which [Bogle] was then the sitting member.‚Äù A new system for appointing boundaries commissions was introducted in 1995, and Taber-Warner was subsequently abolished. Most of its territory was transferred to Cardston-Taber-Warner in 1997, with the Coaldale area transferred to Little Bow. The second iteration of the district took sections of Cardston-Taber- Warner, Little Bow and Cypress-Medicine Hat. It is significantly larger in area than the first, now stretching east to the border of Cypress County, but still entirely south of the Old Man and South Saskatchewan rivers. ===Representation history=== {  align=right !colspan=5Members of the Legislative Assembly for Taber-Warner - !Assembly !Years !colspan=\\"2\\"Member !Party - align=\\"center\\" colspan=5See Taber and Warner 1913-1963 - 15th 1963‚Äì1967 rowspan=3  Leonard Halmrast rowspan=3Social Credit - 16th 1967‚Äì1971 rowspan=2Douglas Miller - 17th 1971‚Äì1975 - 18th 1975‚Äì1979 rowspan=6  rowspan=5Robert Bogle rowspan=6Progressive Conservative - 19th 1979‚Äì1982 - 20th 1982‚Äì1986 - 21st 1986‚Äì1989 - 22nd 1989‚Äì1993 - 23rd 1993‚Äì1997 Ron Hierath - align=\\"center\\" colspan=5See Cardston-Taber-Warner and Little Bow 1997-2019 - 30th 2019‚Äì   Grant Hunter United Conservative } Taber-Warner's first representative was the incumbent Warner MLA and Social Credit Minister for Public Welfare Leonard Halmrast, who had already served five terms in the Legislature. As no other candidates stood against him in the 1963 election, Taber-Warner holds the distinction of being the last district to elect an MLA by acclamation in Alberta. Halmrast retired at the end of that term. Social Credit easily kept the seat in 1967, with Douglas Miller becoming MLA. In 1971, the party lost the general election to Peter Lougheed's Progressive Conservatives (PCs), but Miller was able to hang on to Taber-Warner by a small margin. He retired from politics in 1975. The 1975 election in Taber-Warner was hotly contested, with second-time PC candidate Robert Bogle facing Social Credit leader and future Reform MP Werner Schmidt. Bogle defeated Schmidt by a wide margin, cementing the demise of Social Credit as a force in Alberta politics. He would go on to serve five terms as MLA, holding the position of Minister of Utilities and Telecommunications between 1982 and 1986, and briefly of PC caucus chair and Whip before his retirement from politics in 1993. The district's last representative was Ron Hierath, who was elected comfortably in 1993 despite the Liberals' best showing in the otherwise conservative district. The riding was merged into Cardston-Taber-Warner in 1997, and Hierath would serve one more term as its first MLA. ==Election results1960s=== -  colspan=4Social Credit hold ===1970s=1980s=1990s=2010s=== { class= !colspan=5Redistributed results, 2015 Alberta general election - !colspan=2Party !Votes !% } ==References== Category:Alberta provincial electoral districts ","title":"Taber-Warner"},{"id":"56065074","text":"Georges Alphonse Hatot (22 December 1876 ‚Äì 8 August 1959) was a theater manager and pioneering french filmmaker during the late 1890s and early twentieth century.

It allows players to interact with others as 3D character models. The game was released for Microsoft Windows as a standalone application compatible with the Oculus DK1 development kit on January 16, 2014, and via Steam's early access program on February 1, 2017. It supports the Oculus Rift, Oculus Rift S, Oculus Quest and the newly added Oculus Quest 2 via the Oculus Store, the HTC Vive series, Windows Mixed Reality headsets and the Valve Index through SteamVR. Notably, it also supports full-body humanoid avatar tracking via Vive Trackers, though none of these accessories are mandatory to play. The game later launched on the Oculus Quest on May 20, 2019, supporting limited cross-play with the Microsoft Windows version. ==Gameplay== Players in VRChat VRChats gameplay is similar to that of games such as Second Life and Habbo Hotel. Players can create their own instanced worlds in which they can interact with each other through virtual avatars. A software development kit released alongside the game gives players the ability to create or import character models from various franchises and adopt them as their personas. Player models are capable of supporting \\"audio lip sync, eye tracking and blinking, and complete range of motion. It also includes several minigames in which players can \\"Capture the Flag, rob a bank in Steel 'n' Gold, and lob digital discs at each other in a match of Battle Discs.\\" Although the game is named \\"VRChat\\", it is not necessary to have VR equipment to play the game. The game also offers a desktop version for those who don't have VR headsets, but it has limitations such as the inability to freely move an avatar's limbs, as well as certain content which require the user make use of both hands, such as a shooting game where the player must use their other hand to reload a weapon while holding it with their primary hand. Desktop Mode users are restricted to a single hand for interaction, but can make use of a windows compatible game-pad for further interaction. As the majority of content in VRChat is user driven, making \\"accessible\\" content cross platform is up to the designer. ==Hardware support== VRChat has extensive support for a large number of VR headsets and accessories, such as the Oculus Rift DK1, DK2, CV1 and S headset variants running on Microsoft Windows with or without the Oculus Home launcher, as well as the Android-based Oculus Quest standalone VR platform. Uniquely to VRChat, users on the Android platform can fully interact with users on the PC platform, provided the player-created avatar is uploaded and optimized for the Quest. Quest users can view PC user's avatars in their \\"full body\\" configurations, and physical movement is accurately synced between clients. Additionally, all VR hardware that is compatible with the SteamVR/OpenVR platform are supported to various degrees. This includes (but is not limited to) the HTC Vive and Vive Pro, as well as the more recent Valve Index as of June 5, 2019. Depending on the headset used, models for the respective controllers will appear while the player is navigating the in-game menu. Controllers which support finger positional tracking such as the Valve Index Controllers and the more limited \\"cap-sense\\" of the Oculus Controllers allow users to make natural hand gestures such as \\"fist\\" or \\"victory\\", which can then be further customized to trigger linked animations, such as a corresponding facial expression. The game allows additional add-on support for hip and feet tracking, among its user base commonly referred to as \\"full-body\\" tracking. Humanoid movement is calculated through unity inverse kinematics. Officially, only the HTC Virtual Reality System Tracker, better known as the \\"Vive Tracker Puck\\" by many, allows this support. Users must purchase one or three tracking \\"pucks\\" (one placed in front of the hips, one on each foot). Users can have \\"hips only\\" for additional tracking fidelity without the need for left and right foot tracking. Unofficially, players have made \\"frankenstein\\" VR setups such as using a PlayStation VR headset to track the head, Xbox's Kinect for the hips and feet and Nintendo Switch Joy-Cons for the hands (alternatively, PlayStation Move controllers) to simulate the full-body tracking the HTC Vive supports, with SteamVR facilitating the combination through custom OpenVR drivers.https://github.com/sharkyh20/KinectToVR ==Community== The game's popularity has been attributed to use by YouTubers and Twitch streamers. VRChat has spawned media such as a weekly newspaper in its forums, and talk shows and podcasts dedicated to a discussion of the game. ==Controversy== VRChat has come under fire several times due to NSFW activities within the game.https://www.dexerto.com/entertainment/twitch- streamer-walks-into-incredibly-nsfw-vrchat-scene-696861 With large communities built around the idea of an 18+ atmosphere, VRChat has often been criticized for a lack of age protection for and against younger users of the game. As well, online child predators have become a problem within many of the communities, and continue to be an ever-present danger that is shared with much of the Internet.https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/12/07/us/video- games-child-sex-abuse.html ==In popular cultureUgandan Knuckles=== VRChat gave rise to a meme known as \\"Ugandan Knuckles\\", in which players use crude in-game models of Knuckles the Echidna from the Sonic the Hedgehog series while repeating the catchphrase \\"Do you know the way?\\" in a mock African accent. The players' model and mannerisms originated in a review by YouTuber Gregzilla and Forsen's Twitch stream respectively, in addition to lines from the Ugandan movie Who Killed Captain Alex? This has generated controversy from many sources; Polygons Julia Alexander labelled it \\"blatantly racist\\" and a \\"problematic meme\\", comparing it to Habbo Hotel raids, and Jay Hathaway of The Daily Dot called it a \\"racist caricature\\". The creator of the 3D model used in the meme expressed regret for having made it, and urged players that they \\"do not use this to bug the users of VRChat.\\" In response, the developers of the game published an open letter on Medium, stating that they were developing \\"new systems to allow the community to better self moderate\\" and asking users to use the built-in muting features. ==See also== *AltspaceVR ‚Äì provided meeting spaces in virtual reality using Microsoft's Kinect *Sansar (video game) ‚Äì social virtual reality platform with a near- identical premise ==References *Official website Category:Massively multiplayer online games Category:Virtual reality communities Category:Virtual reality games Category:Windows games Category:HTC Vive games Category:Obscenity controversies in video games Category:Oculus Rift games Category:Oculus Quest games Category:Video games with cel-shaded animation Category:Early access video games Category:Free-to-play video games Category:2017 video games Category:Unity (game engine) games Category:Video games developed in the United States Category:Video games with user-generated gameplay content ","title":"VRChat"},{"id":"56065188","text":"Stabel is a surname which is commonly seen in Norway.

WID, also referred to as WID.world, is an open source database, that is part of an international collaborative effort of over a hundred researchers in five continents. The World Inequality Report includes discussions on potential future academic research as well as content useful for public debates and policy related to economic inequality. The first report, entitled World Inequality Report 2018, which was released on December 14, 2017 at the Paris School of Economics during the first WID.world Conference, was compiled by Facundo Alvaredo, Lucas Chancel, Thomas Piketty, Emmanuel Saez, and Gabriel Zucman based on WID data. The 300-page report cautions that since 1980, around the globe, there has been an increase in the gap between rich and poor. In Europe, the increase in inequality increased more moderately while in North America and Asia, the increase was rapid. In the Middle East, Africa, and Brazil, income inequality did not increase but remained at very high levels. In an interview with Quartz, Piketty predicted that if the \\"world follows the trajectory of the US\\" inequality would get much worse. ==World Inequality Lab== The World Inequality Lab aims to promote research on global inequality dynamics. Its missions are the intension of the World Inequality Database, the production of analysis on global inequality dynamics, and the dissemination in the public debate. The Lab works in close coordination with a large international network of researchers (over one hundred researchers covering nearly seventy countries) contributing to the database, in a collaborative effort to extend the existing database, which provides data on both distribution of income and wealth, \\"as well as the distribution of different forms of capital assets, in the analyzed countries\\". By 2015, the WID provided data series on the distribution of income and wealth in thirty-three countries mainly from the Americas and Europe. At that time there the intention was to \\"include data series for an additional forty countries.\\" The first WID in 2013, which was placed in an open source repository in September 2013, was compiled by Facundo Alvaredo, Anthony B.

From 2016 to 2017, through a 2015 Centers for Equitable Growth (CEG), Piketty, Saez, and Zucman studied Distributional National Accounts (DINA) for the United States. \\"DINA are defined as distributional statistics of pre-tax and post-tax income and wealth consistent with National Income and Product Accounts, and the Flow of Funds of the United States.\\"Piketty, Thomas. 2014.

More aggressive redistribution through taxes and transfers has spared Europe from the acute disparities that Americans have grown used to. Unequal access to education is helping reproduce inequality in the United States down the generations.\\" The Times article also noted that, \\"China's strategy based on low-skill manufacturing for export, and underpinned by aggressive investment in infrastructure, has proven more effective at raising living standards for the bottom half of the population than India's more inward-looking strategy, which has limited the benefits of globalization to the well-educated elite.\\" Tetlow of the Financial Times described inequality as the \\"defining characteristic of the age\\" as The rich get richer and the poor get poorer. The India Times article drew attention to the way in which \\"[d]eregulation and opening-up reforms in India since 1980s have led to substantial increase in inequality so much that top 0.1% of earners has continued to capture more growth than all those in the bottom 50% combined.\\" The WIR reported that, \\"Income inequality in India has reached historically high levels. In 2014, the share of national income accruing to India's top 1% of earners was 22%, while the share of the top 10% was around 56%.\\" Quartz cited the report, \\"[S]ince 1980 the top 0.1% have captured as much income growth as the entire bottom half of world's (adult) population. And for the group of people in between the bottom 50% and top 1%‚Äîmostly the lower- and middle-income groups in North America and Europe‚Äîincome growth has been either sluggish or flat.\\" The WIR 2018 shows that, \\"The gap between rich and poor has increased in nearly every region in the world over the past few decades.\\" Since \\"1980, income inequality has increased rapidly in North America and Asia, increased more moderately in Europe, and stabilized at very high levels in the Middle East, Africa, and Brazil.\\" ==First WID.world conference== The conference held on December 14 and December 15, was sponsored by the Paris School of Economics, the Institute for New Economic Thinking, the Washington Center for Equitable Growth (CEG), the Ford Foundation, and the European Research Council.

The executive committee of the conference included Alvaredo, Chancel, Piketty, Saez, Zucman, the WID.world and the World Inequality Lab Executive Committee. The program included the release of the report that would \\"provide global estimates of income and wealth inequality drawing on the latest evidence gathered in WID.world\\" [and ] \\"discuss implications for future research and the global policy debate on rising inequality\\". There was a session honoring Tony Atkinson and presentations of \\"research papers on income and wealth inequality\\" and \\"on the DINA-Distributional National Accounts agenda\\". ==Media coverage== Within days of its December 14, 2017 publication online, the report was featured in articles in the New York Times, The Guardian, Quartz,Financial Times, the India Times, and Associated Press via ABC News. In the interview with Quartz, Piketty warned of the impediments to getting \\"a comprehensive picture of wealth\\", such as tax havens. Piketty observed that \\"there are financial and political forces that have a vested interest in keeping this information secret,\\" noting the \\"paradox of today's globalized economy\\" where \\"we are supposed to be in the era of big data and transparency, and we see that we still don't have access to all the data sources we would need.\\" ==References== Category:Income distribution Category:Taxation and redistribution Category:Economics research Category:Economic research institutes Category:Research on poverty Category:Public economics Category:Books about economic inequality Category:Economic globalization Category:Social inequality Category:Taxation in the United States Category:Economic inequality in the United States ","title":"World Inequality Report"},{"id":"56065235","text":"The 2007 AT&T; 250 was a NASCAR Busch Series stock car race that took place on June 23, 2007. Held at the Milwaukee Mile in West Allis, Wisconsin, the race was the 17th of 35 in the 2007 NASCAR Busch Series season. Aric Almirola of Joe Gibbs Racing (JGR) was the listed winner of the race, Richard Childress Racing's Scott Wimmer finished second, and Braun Racing's Jason Leffler finished third. The race became controversial because of a driver change made by the No. 20 JGR team. Almirola qualified the car on pole position, though Gibbs intended to have NASCAR Nextel Cup Series regular Denny Hamlin run the race. The Cup Series was racing that weekend at Infineon Raceway in Sonoma, California, and Hamlin's helicopter could not find a landing spot at the track in time for the start of the race. Almirola was thus forced to start the race and ran the first 59 laps before he was pulled out of the car under caution; Hamlin finished the race and came from behind to win after losing a lap to the leaders during the driver change. NASCAR rules say the driver who starts the race gets credit for the result, making Almirola the official race winner. The driver change frustrated Almirola, who proceeded to leave the track before the race ended, and it was further criticized by ESPN writer Terry Blount, who called the substitution \\"a Busch-league move.\\" The win for which Almirola was given credit was the first of his Busch Series career. Carl Edwards, who led nearly half of the race for Roush Fenway Racing (RFR), recovered from a flat tire to finish eighth, maintaining a significant lead in the Drivers' Championship. Edwards's No. 60 RFR team also maintained their Owners' Championship lead, and Chevrolet continued to lead the Manufacturers' Championship. ==Background== Wisconsin native Scott Wimmer (pictured in 2009) entered the race optimistic about performing well at his home track. The Busch Series first came to the Milwaukee Mile in the 1984 and 1985 seasons before taking a seven-year absence from visiting the track. It returned to the schedule in 1993 and had been on the series calendar every year since then leading up to the 2007 edition of the race. The track itself was originally built as a horse racing track, and it later held its first automobile race in 1903, making it the oldest motor racing track in the United States. Entering the race, the last two Busch Series races at Milwaukee had been won by Johnny Sauter and Paul Menard, both from Wisconsin. Four Wisconsin-born drivers entered the race hoping to continue the trend: Scott Wimmer, Todd Kluever, Kelly Bires, and Frank Kreyer. Wimmer, who entered the race with three consecutive top-five finishes and five straight top-tens, stated, \\"It's really exciting anytime I go back to Wisconsin for racing, especially The Milwaukee Mile. I've been going there since I can remember and watching a lot of great drivers racing out there.\\" He also expressed excitement at the prospect of winning the upcoming race, saying, \\"It would really be neat to win a race there. I think that any Wisconsin driver, no matter what series, wants to win there.\\" Carl Edwards led the Drivers' Championship entering the race with 2,534 points. Dave Blaney followed in second with 1,833, while Kevin Harvick was third with 1,798. David Reutimann, Regan Smith, David Ragan, Greg Biffle, Marcos Ambrose, Bobby Hamilton Jr., and Jason Leffler rounded out the top ten. Jack Roush, owner of Edwards' No. 60 car, led the Owners' Championship, also with 2,534 points. Richard Childress's No. 29 team, shared by Wimmer and Jeff Burton, followed in second with 2,323, while Joe Gibbs's No. 20, Childress's No. 21, and DeLana Harvick's No. 33 teams completed the top-five. Chevrolet led the Manufacturers' Championship with 115 points; Ford, Dodge, and Toyota followed with 109, 69, and 59 respectively. Menard, the defending race winner, did not participate. ===Standings before the race=== {  - + Drivers' Championship standings - ! scope=\\"col\\"  Rank ! scope=\\"col\\"  Driver ! scope=\\"col\\"  Points - ! scope=\\"row\\"  1  Carl Edwards  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"2,534 - ! scope=\\"row\\"  2  Dave Blaney  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"1,833 (‚Äì701) - ! scope=\\"row\\"  3  Kevin Harvick  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"1,798 (‚Äì736) - ! scope=\\"row\\"  4  David Reutimann  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"1,764 (‚Äì770) - ! scope=\\"row\\"  5  Regan Smith  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"1,744 (‚Äì790) - ! scope=\\"row\\"  6  David Ragan  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"1,713 (‚Äì821) - ! scope=\\"row\\"  7  Greg Biffle  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"1,647 (‚Äì887) - ! scope=\\"row\\"  8  Marcos Ambrose  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"1,638 (‚Äì896) - ! scope=\\"row\\"  9  Bobby Hamilton Jr.  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"1,629 (‚Äì905) - ! scope=\\"row\\"  10  Jason Leffler  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"1,603 (‚Äì931) - class=\\"sortbottom\\" colspan=\\"9\\" } { - + Owners' Championship standings - ! scope=\\"col\\"  Rank ! scope=\\"col\\"  Owner ! scope=\\"col\\"  ! scope=\\"col\\"  Points - ! scope=\\"row\\"  1  Jack Roush  60  style=\\"text- align:center;\\"2,534 - ! scope=\\"row\\"  2  Richard Childress  29  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"2,323 (‚Äì211) - ! scope=\\"row\\"  3  Joe Gibbs  20  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"2,092 (‚Äì442) - class=\\"sortbottom\\" - ! scope=\\"row\\"  4  Richard Childress  21  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"1,979 (‚Äì555) - ! scope=\\"row\\"  5  DeLana Harvick  33  style=\\"text- align:center;\\"1,912 (‚Äì622) - class=\\"sortbottom\\" colspan=\\"9\\" } { - + Manufacturers' Championship standings - ! scope=\\"col\\"  Rank ! scope=\\"col\\"  Manufacturer ! scope=\\"col\\"  Points - ! scope=\\"row\\"  1  Chevrolet  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"115 - ! scope=\\"row\\"  2  Ford  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"109 (‚Äì6) - ! scope=\\"row\\"  3  Dodge  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"69 (‚Äì46) - class=\\"sortbottom\\" - ! scope=\\"row\\"  4  Toyota  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"59 (‚Äì56) - class=\\"sortbottom\\" colspan=\\"9\\" } *Note: Only the top ten and five positions are included for the driver and owner standings respectively. ==ReportPractice and qualifying=== Aric Almirola qualified the car on pole position and was expected to hand the car over to Denny Hamlin for the race. Two practice sessions were held the morning and afternoon before the evening race. With a time of 29.981 seconds, Wimmer was the quickest in the opening session ahead of Aric Almirola, Stephen Leicht, Reutimann, and Shane Huffman. Positions six through ten were occupied by Hamilton, Erik Darnell, Travis Kvapil, Todd Bodine, and Kelly Bires. In the second practice session, Wimmer was once again quickest with a lap time of 29.821 seconds, followed by Almirola, Johnny Benson Jr., Brad Coleman, Jason Keller, Leffler, Darnell, Huffman, Scott Lagasse Jr., and Leicht. Forty-four cars entered qualifying; due to NASCAR's qualifying procedure, only forty-three could race. Almirola qualified his No. 20 car on pole position with a time of 29.608 seconds. Almirola was set to step aside for the race, however, as Nextel Cup Series regular Denny Hamlin was scheduled to travel from Infineon Raceway in Sonoma, California to compete in the Saturday night event in Milwaukee. Almirola, who also qualified Hamlin's car on the pole the year before, commented, \\"Man, two poles in a row at Milwaukee and I don't get to race. Something's got to be set for that. I'll sit on the pit box and watch. I've got a lot to learn about racing these Busch cars and Denny is really, really good, so I'll just sit there and listen and learn all I can from Denny.\\" Almirola was joined on the front row by Leffler, while Wimmer, Coleman, and Huffman rounded out the top-five qualifiers. Bodine, Benson, Reutimann, Edwards, and Lagasse made up positions six through ten. Danny Efland was the only driver who failed to qualify as he did not set a qualifying time. Edwards replaced Kvapil in the No. 60 car after practice, qualifying in ninth. Like Hamlin, Edwards was also traveling from Sonoma and nearly missed qualifying, later remarking, \\"One minute later, we wouldn't have made it.\\" ===Race=== Denny Hamlin stepped into Almirola's car on lap 59 and proceeded to win the race. The 250-lap race began at 8:00p.m. EDT, and was televised live in the United States on ESPN2. Hamlin's helicopter could not find a place to land in the infield; the helicopter pad was blocked by parked cars, forcing Hamlin to land elsewhere and arrive late via ground transportation. Hamlin was thus unable to start the race in Almirola's car, forcing Almirola to start the race himself. Ragan, the third Nextel Cup regular traveling to the track from Sonoma along with Hamlin and Edwards, replaced Darnell in Roush's No.6 car; Ragan was forced to move to the rear of the field because of the driver swap and an engine change, as was Chase Miller who went to a backup car. Almirola maintained his lead from pole position for the first 43 laps before being passed by Edwards. The caution had been displayed on lap 30 due to oil on the track in turn four, and shortly after the lap 43 restart, Edwards took over the lead of the race. On lap 57, Ron Hornaday Jr. was involved in an accident, prompting another caution period. It was under this caution period that the Gibbs team elected to make the driver change, and Hamlin took over driving the car for the remainder of the race. Hamlin lost a lap and fell to 34th place, remaining a lap down until lap 149 when he received the free pass, allowing him to return to the lead lap. Edwards, meanwhile, continued to lead the race for a total of 123 laps, before Mike Wallace assumed the race lead. Six laps later, on lap 173, Hamlin completed his comeback drive to retake the lead for the No. 20 team. Edwards, meanwhile, suffered misfortune in the form of a flat right rear tire around the same period in the race, forcing him to pit with 77 laps remaining. On lap 223, Kreyer was involved in an accident, causing the caution to be displayed again. Wimmer assumed the lead after pit stops, holding it until the caution came out again for Kevin Hamlin's accident. On the restart, Wimmer battled for the lead with Leffler, while Hamlin made it three-wide to retake the lead with 13 laps to go. Marc Mitchell, Richard Johns, and Brent Sherman crashed on lap 244, requiring another caution to be displayed. The race restarted with four laps remaining, with Hamlin retaining the lead to the finish. Since NASCAR rules credit the finishing position to the starting driver, Almirola was awarded the win. Wimmer, Leffler, and Coleman followed in second through fourth, while Keller, Bodine, Reutimann, Edwards, Benson, and Huffman completed the top-ten. Hamlin's margin of victory over Wimmer was .502 seconds. ===Post-race comments=== Hamlin appeared in Victory Lane to represent Almirola's first career win in front of a crowd of 41,900 attendants, earning $66,823 for the victory; both the win and the prize money were credited to Almirola, while team president J.D.Gibbs confirmed that Almirola would receive the winner's check. Hamlin credited Almirola for putting the team in a good position prior to the race, saying Almirola \\"did all the hard work.\\" Runner-up Wimmer was taken aback that Gibbs elected to make the driver change: \\"I was surprised they did it, because Aric was running a good race.\\" He also believed fewer caution periods may have given him a better chance to win the race, saying, \\"I just drove as hard as I could, and unfortunately we weren't as good on the short runs. We'd get going after 20 laps, and I didn't need those cautions. Maybe we'll get a win one day. Maybe we won't. I don't know.\\" Gibbs explained that Almirola was frustrated after being taken out of the car: \\"He's upset. I left a message for him [Saturday] night. I know he's upset. I would be too if I'm in his shoes.\\" He also expressed relief that Hamlin was able to win the race, arguing, \\"Thank goodness he won. It would have looked bad if he didn't.\\" When explaining why the team made the decision to put Hamlin in the car, Gibbs said, \\"I told those guys as a group, if you think Denny can get in the car and win the race, let's go. Let's do that. If you don't think he can do that, let Aric run it out. Our guys kind of thought about it as a group and said, 'OK, we think Denny can run well and we're fast enough to win the race.' That was a huge discouragement of course to Aric.\\" Other reasons included sponsorship obligations with Rockwell Automation, which sponsored the No. 20 car. Coleman, a Joe Gibbs Racing teammate, believed, \\"That might have had something to do with it.\\" Almirola also expressed his belief that Rockwell, who are headquartered in Wisconsin, wanted Hamlin to drive during the race. \\"I totally understand the Gibbs side of the situation. You need that Cup superstar to sell sponsorship. It's not easy to sell sponsorship for somebody who hasn't proven themselves yet, and I understand that. At the time, in the heat of the moment, I was deep in the battle of the race. I didn't totally agree and understand the situation. But looking back on it now, I understand it. Rockwell's invested a lot in Denny Hamlin and Joe Gibbs Racing, so they deserved everything they got there at Milwaukee. They deserved to have their racecar in the spotlight and I was happy that I got the pole for them and that Denny won the race.\\" He also said he did not consider himself to have won his first career race. \\"I feel like I was a part of it, but by no way, shape or form do I feel like that was my first victory. I feel like my first victory is still to come and I'll actually be in the car when it crosses the start-finish line for that one.\\" Carl Edwards remained the Drivers' Championship leader after the race with 2,686 points. The driver change also attracted criticism from ESPN journalist Terry Blount, who called it \\"a Busch-league move,\\" writing, \\"As if we don't have enough Cup dominance in the Busch Series, now they're replacing Busch drivers after a race starts.\\" He continued, \\"Almirola was furious. Good for him. He should be furious. If a driver isn't angry about getting pulled from the car in the middle of a race, then he needs to take up another profession.\\" Edwards, who led the most laps and recovered to finish eighth after dominating the early stages of the race, insisted the night was \\"still fun,\\" saying, \\"It was pretty frustrating. But you know what's cool? We raced hard and we had a lot of fun racing here at Milwaukee. Congratulations to Denny Hamlin. I can't believe they did a driver switch and he still won the race; that's pretty awesome... we just kind of had a bad luck night.\\" The result kept Edwards in the lead in the Drivers' Championship with a new total of 2,686 points. Reutimann and Ragan improved their positions to second and third (albeit 776 and 846 points behind) respectively, while Blaney and Kevin Harvick fell to fourth and fifth. Leffler, Ambrose, Hamilton, Smith, and Leicht rounded out the top ten. Roush's No. 60 team also maintained the lead in a much closer Owners' Championship with 2,686 points; Wimmer's strong second-place finish left Childress's No. 29 team only 188 points behind Roush, while Gibbs's No. 20, Childress's No. 21, and DeLana Harvick's No. 33 remained third, fourth, and fifth. Chevrolet maintained their lead in the Manufacturers' Championship with 124 points; Ford, Dodge, and Toyota followed with 113, 72, and 65 respective points. ==ResultsQualifying=== {  - + Qualifying results - ! scope=\\"col\\"  ! scope=\\"col\\"  ! scope=\\"col\\"  Driver ! scope=\\"col\\"  Team ! scope=\\"col\\"  Manufacturer ! scope=\\"col\\"  ! scope=\\"col\\"  - ! scope=\\"row\\"  1  20  Aric Almirola  Joe Gibbs Racing  Chevrolet  29.608  121.589 - ! scope=\\"row\\"  2  38  Jason Leffler  Braun Racing  Toyota  29.613  121.568 - ! scope=\\"row\\"  3  29  Scott Wimmer  Richard Childress Racing  Chevrolet  29.642  121.449 - ! scope=\\"row\\"  4  18  Brad Coleman  Joe Gibbs Racing  Chevrolet  29.675  121.314 - ! scope=\\"row\\"  5  88  Shane Huffman  JR Motorsports  Chevrolet  29.718  121.139 - ! scope=\\"row\\"  6  10  Todd Bodine  Braun Racing  Toyota  29.777  120.899 - ! scope=\\"row\\"  7  1  Johnny Benson Jr.  Phoenix Racing  Chevrolet  29.797  120.817 - ! scope=\\"row\\"  8  99  David Reutimann  Michael Waltrip Racing  Toyota  29.824  120.708 - ! scope=\\"row\\"  9  60  Carl Edwards  Roush Fenway Racing  Ford  29.835  120.664 - ! scope=\\"row\\"  10  41  Scott Lagasse Jr.  Chip Ganassi Racing  Dodge  29.866  120.538 - ! scope=\\"row\\"  11  35  Bobby Hamilton Jr.  Team Rensi Motorsports  Ford  29.901  120.397 - ! scope=\\"row\\"  12  59  Marcos Ambrose  JTG Racing  Ford  29.924  120.305 - ! scope=\\"row\\"  13  6  Erik Darnell  Roush Fenway Racing  Ford  29.952  120.192 - ! scope=\\"row\\"  14  47  Kelly Bires  JTG Racing  Ford  29.952  120.192 - ! scope=\\"row\\"  15  90  Stephen Leicht  Robert Yates Racing  Ford  29.971  120.116 - ! scope=\\"row\\"  16  66  Steve Wallace  Rusty Wallace Racing  Dodge  29.980  120.080 - ! scope=\\"row\\"  17  37  Bobby East  Brewco Motorsports  Ford  30.018  119.928 - ! scope=\\"row\\"  18  22  Mike Bliss  Fitz Motorsports  Dodge  30.026  119.896 - ! scope=\\"row\\"  19  9  Chase Miller  Evernham Motorsports  Dodge  30.050  119.800 - ! scope=\\"row\\"  20  7  Mike Wallace  Phoenix Racing  Chevrolet  30.059  119.765 - ! scope=\\"row\\"  21  27  Jason Keller  Brewco Motorsports  Ford  30.111  119.558 - ! scope=\\"row\\"  22  42  Kevin Hamlin  Chip Ganassi Racing  Dodge  30.181  119.280 - ! scope=\\"row\\"  23  16  Todd Kluever  Roush Fenway Racing  Ford  30.201  119.201 - ! scope=\\"row\\"  24  21  Tim McCreadie  Richard Childress Racing  Chevrolet  30.202  119.197 - ! scope=\\"row\\"  25  25  Richard Johns  Team Rensi Motorsports  Ford  30.207  119.178 - ! scope=\\"row\\"  26  70  Mark Green  ML Motorsports  Chevrolet  30.233  119.075 - ! scope=\\"row\\"  27  77  Ron Hornaday Jr.  Kevin Harvick Incorporated  Chevrolet  30.234  119.071 - ! scope=\\"row\\"  28  33  Cale Gale  Kevin Harvick Incorporated  Chevrolet  30.238  119.055 - ! scope=\\"row\\"  29  14  Kyle Krisiloff  Carl A.

It connects the Hintere Schlattli in the municipalities of Muotatal, Morschach, and Schwyz with the village and mountain resort of Stoos, above Morschach. On a length of 1.7 kilometres (1.1 mi), it overcomes a height difference of 744 metres (2,441 ft). It opened on 15 December 2017 and replaces the older Schwyz-Stoos funicular, operating since 1933. The carriages are barrel-shaped and rotate to maintain a level floor surface for passengers. Construction took five years and cost 52 million Swiss francs. The new line has a maximum gradient of 110% (47.7¬∞) and is the steepest funicular railway in Switzerland and Europe, superseding the Gelmerbahn. It has been widely claimed to be the steepest in the world, although the Katoomba Scenic Railway in Australia is steeper, with a maximum gradient of 122%, but uses a winch system and is, therefore, an incline lift and not a funicular railway. ==References External links == * Official site Category:Funicular railways in Switzerland Category:Transport in the canton of Schwyz Category:1200 mm gauge railways in Switzerland Category:Railway lines opened in 2017 ","title":"Stoosbahn"},{"id":"56065262","text":"G√©rard Ugolini (born 9 February 1949) is a French athlete.

A Fort Worth, Texas civic leader, she led the garden club movement in Texas, wrote numerous columns for state and local newspapers, and was instrumental in the creation of the Fort Worth Botanic Garden, the oldest botanical garden in Texas. == Early life and education== Mary Sabina Daggett was born November 11, 1880 in Fort Worth, Texas to Ephraim Merrill \\"Bud\\" and Laura Alice Palmer Daggett. Mary's father, a cowboy and trail driver-turned- cattleman, came from a family of local pioneers: his uncle and namesake, Ephraim Merrill Daggett (1810-1883) is known as the \\"Father of Fort Worth.\\" She attended Fort Worth public schools and studied botany and music at Cottey College, a women's liberal arts college in Missouri. ==Career== She returned to Fort Worth and married William Fletcher Lake, a local cattleman, in March 1899; they had three children together. === Local historian === A dedicated genealogist, Mary Daggett Lake was a member of the Daughters of the American Revolution and Daughters of the Republic of Texas. She conducted extensive research into the history of North Texas, especially Fort Worth and the nearby settlements of Bird's Fort, Grapevine Springs, Denton, and Fort Belknap. She wrote a series of articles on Tarrant County's first settlers, based on interviews and written accounts from surviving family members, which ran in the Fort Worth Star-Telegram from 1926 to 1938. She was also the historical research chairman of the 1936 Texas Centennial. Mary Daggett Lake was a charter member of The Woman's Club of Fort Worth establishing its Texana library in 1932. === Botanist and educator === Mary Daggett Lake studied botany at Cottey College and worked for twelve years in the private herbarium of Dr. Albert Ruth, which is now part of the Botanical Research Institute of Texas collection.

Wednesday, 11 May 1904; Page: 7 (18 June 1816 ‚Äì 2 May 1903) was a Cumbrian-born philanthropist and businessman who at the time of his death was the richest resident of the Isle of Man. Noble bequeathed a large amount of his vast fortune to the people of the Isle of Man, resulting in numerous civic amenities such as recreation grounds, swimming baths, a library and a hospital.Mona's Herald. Wednesday, 6 May 1903; Page: 7Isle of Man Examiner, Tuesday 28 November 2017. ==BiographyEarly life=== Henry Noble was born in the village of Clifton, Westmorland (now part of Cumbria) on 18 June 1816, the first son of John Noble and Mary (n√©e Bloom). It is said that he came from a poor failed farming family, his father finding work as a customs official. Original Henry Noble wine and spirit warehouse. ===Business=== Wine & Spirits His first connection with Douglas was due to his association with Alexander Spittall, father of James Spittall, a Douglas advocate. The elder Spittall was a wine and spirits merchant, whose principal place of business was Whitehaven, Cumbria, although he had a branch established in Douglas. Noble was employed by Spittall as a clerk, rising to the position of manager in 1835 following which he moved to Douglas with his mother. The Nobles took residence in a house belonging to Spittall on the south side of St Barnabas' Square. Noble did not stay in the employ of Spittall for very much longer, but set up in the wine and spirits business on his own behalf; his first shop was on Fleetwood Corner. Henry Noble is said to have made his first money whilst still in the employ of Alexander Spittall, by speculating in the shares of the Great Laxey Mine. He continued his wholesale wine and spirits business and supplemented this by the sale of seeds and other commodities for farmers. He then opened a timber yard at the corner of the Lake under Bank's Hill. In time he transferred his wine and spirits business to premises in St George's St (now occupied by Joseph Bucknall & Sons) and had his saw pits and timber yard in the large area between Hill St and Mytle St, in the area where St Mary's Church now stands; the whole block at that time belonged to Noble. Large profits were generated from both these concerns, and this led Noble to invest in shipping. Shipping The first ship he owned was named Jane and Agnes, and the next the Rebecca and Maria, said to have been two of the finest and smartest schooners operating from Douglas. He used the ships in two ways: * in connection with his own business and those of other charterers of the Port of Douglas; * they were also put to work for the Great Laxey Mining Company. =Isle of Man Steam Packet Company= By the 1880s Henry Noble had also become a major shareholder in the Isle of Man Steam Packet Company, serving on the Board of Directors and being appointed Chairman. However his vision for the company, which would have seen the introduction of fast screw-driven steamers from the 1880s, was in opposition to the rest of the board who favoured paddle-driven ships. This largely brought about his resignation, however by the turn of the century it was clear that Noble's vision was the way forward. After resigning from the board, Noble did not desert the company altogether, but offered financial assistance to help the company to compete in a price war with the Isle of Man, Liverpool and Manchester Steamship Company. He advanced at short notice a loan of ¬£20,000 (¬£2,500,000 as of 2018). The security was a mortgage on the company, which was paid off in a short time, following the Isle of Man Steam Packet Company's acquisition of the Isle of Man, Liverpool and Manchester Steamship Company in 1888. Utility companies In the 1840s the town of Douglas was beginning to experience an influx of tourists, which led to a boom by the turn of the century. Noble helped the town to development infrastructure to accommodate this. He invested in the Douglas Gas Light Company and was one of the founders of the Douglas Water Works Company: he was appointed Chairman, a post he held until the company was acquired by the Douglas Town Commissioners for the huge figure of ¬£144,000 (equivalent to ¬£18.3 million in 2018). A certain amount of skulduggery surrounds the transaction of the money. Henry Noble was one of the founders of the Isle of Man Bank, and at the time of the purchase of the Douglas Water Works Company, the Town Commissioners banked their money with Dumbell's Bank. Noble refused a cheque drawn on Dumbell's Bank, but insisted on cash. Without the required cash at hand, the Town Treasurer was required to make provision partly in gold, with the balance made up of Bank of England notes. On the day of the transaction the gold was brought to the offices of the company and weighed, and the notes were counted. All duly accounted for, the receipt was signed by Noble and his co-directors. Had the money not been forthcoming on the specific day, a penalty clause would have been enacted increasing the consideration by ¬£5,000 (¬£630,000 as of 2018) with a further penalty of ¬£5,000 ten days later, and so on. There was quite an outcry from Dumbell's Bank concerning Noble's behaviour, being seen as an unjustifiable attempt to reduce confidence in the bank. However given what later happened to Dumbell's Bank, it may be seen that Noble was aware of how matters stood at Dumbell's. Banking =Isle of Man Bank= Following the passing of the Companies Act 1865 on the Isle of Man, Noble, together with William Moore, Samuel Harris and William Callister founded the Isle of Man Bank that October. Noble served as a director of the bank until he retired as a consequence of his health in the late 1890s. Property Noble worked in conjunction with Governor Loch on the construction of Victoria Street, then the main thoroughfare of Douglas. His astute vision led him to acquire many of the most desirable building plots in the town. He was also one of the proprietors of the Castle Mona Estate, which was sold to a syndicate for ¬£80,000 (¬£10,100,000 as of 2018). The property was the former Isle of Man residence of the Dukes of Atholl. Before 1850 Queen Victoria proposed buying it as a more suitable royal residence than Osborne House. In 1868 Noble bought the Villa Marina which at that time was rented by the Isle of Man Government as the residence of the Lieutenant Governor, Francis Pigott. Noble purchased the estate in its entirety from Frances Dutton for the sum of ¬£7,500 (¬£822,500 as of 2018). It is said many people scoffed at the amount which Noble had paid, scornfully predicting that he would in no way recover the amount he had invested. However the value went up as a result of the increasing affluence of the town, to such a degree that in 1898 Noble refused an offer of ¬£120,000 (¬£15,200,000 as of 2018). Upon his death the Villa Marina was bequeathed to the town of Douglas. Noble's last open property purchase was that of the former residence of Colonel Shum for the sum of ¬£5,400, on land where today the Sefton Hotel and the Gaiety Theatre stand. The local Hospital Committee had earmarked the land for a hospital site, but Noble, as the chief owner of property in the proximity, thwarted this attempt. In less than five years Noble had sold the site for ¬£15,000 the site undergoing development. ==Personal life== Because of Noble's business dealings it was inevitable that he attracted the ire of others, being accused of sharp practice on more than one occasion. Henry Noble's only known relative was a young man named Mason. Said to have been a great favourite of his, he had stayed with him on the Isle of Man several times. It is said he went to sea, and was drowned. He was a staunch churchgoer, said to be of the evangelical type and together with his wife he would attend St George's Church, Douglas. The stained glass windows in the church's east end, said to be the finest of their type on the Isle of Man, were erected by him in the mid 1860s at a cost of ¬£600 (¬£73,000 as of 2018). The Noble family grave, Braddan Cemetery, Isle of Man. In 1885 Henry Noble became the Captain of the Parish of Lonan, Isle of Man as position he held until his death.https://www.culturevannin.im/parishcaptains/parish_447590.htmlIsle of Man Examiner. Saturday, 1 July 1905; Page: 4 ===Marriage=== In April 1862 Henry Noble married Rebecca Thompson, and granddaughter of Calcott Heywood who had been a Captain in the Manx Fencibles. They lived initially at the corner of Hope Street and Peel Road, until Noble bought the Villa Marina which was to become their home. The marriage produced no children. Mrs Noble is also remembered as a great benefactor to poor people, a specific legacy from her being the founding of the Douglas Orphanage, a plight which was said to be particularly close to her heart. ===Death=== Henry Noble died at the Villa Marina on 2 May 1903, having been predeceased by his wife. His funeral took place on Wednesday 6 May, his body being interred with that of his wife in a grave in the north corner of Braddan Cemetery. The Douglas Soup Dispensary, Myrtle St, Douglas Isle of Man. Erected for charitable purposes in 1908 and paid for by the Henry Bloom Noble Charitable Trust. ==Charitable bequests== Noble's legacy is one of immense generosity to the Isle of Man, particularly its capital, Douglas. Some of the beneficiaries of the munificence of Henry Noble include: * Noble‚Äôs Hospital * Noble's Park * Ramsey Cottage Hospital * Knockaloe Farm * Villa Marina * St Ninian's Church * Noble's Baths * Douglas Soup Dispensary The Henry Bloom Noble Trust is one of the longest established charities on the Isle of Man, having originally been established in 1888 as the Trustees of Noble‚Äôs Isle of Man Hospital and Dispensary; the first trustees were the Lord Bishop, John Bardsley, and the Clerk of the Rolls, Sir Alured Dumbell. Following Noble's death the trust became a statutory body in 1909; and in 2003 was renamed the Henry Bloom Noble Trust. In addition the Henry Bloom Noble Scholarship Trust provides funding for Manx students to complete their education at a university in the United Kingdom. Numerous other bequests have benefited the Isle of Man. Amongst these were ¬£10,000 for the construction of St Ninian's Church Douglas; Ramsey Cottage Hospital; ¬£5,000 for nursing home accommodation; and bequests to a large number of charities, including the Church Missionary Society and the British and Foreign Bible Society. Provision was also made by the trustees of the fund for the maintenance of a nurse in the parish of Lonan. Noble was also a chief contributor to the voluntarily supported home for the aged poor, more formally referred to as the House of Industry, and for many years he supplied those in residence with their Christmas dinner. In addition there bequests to infirmaries in Liverpool and Cumberland and a fund was set up to supply district nurses to be trained in Liverpool before returning to the Isle of Man. A tuberculosis sanatorium in Norfolk where people from the Isle of Man received care also was a beneficiary. Foundation Stone of the original Noble's Hospital ===Noble's Hospital=== Before the 1880s the Isle of Man had suffered from the lack of a properly equipped and modern hospital; this was of particular concern to Rebecca Noble. Until then, the island's only hospital was the fever hospital in Fort Street. Having thwarted the intention of the Isle of Man's Hospital Committee to erect a hospital on land which he had purchased, Noble let it be known that not only would he donate land for a hospital, but he would pay for building it. Rebecca Noble bequeathed land she owned in the vicinity of what is now Crellin's Hill in 1885, and having unveiled the foundation stone she oversaw the initial construction of the hospital, although she died before its completion. Today the building which was the original Noble's Hospital houses the Manx Museum. The hospital, with the extension to Clifton House, for a nurse residence, cost Noble over ¬£10,000 (¬£1,250,000 as of 2018) not including the land. The original Noble's Hospital was replaced by a newer and much larger hospital, situated on land owned by Noble and which was located on what became the Westmorland Road, Douglas (named after the county of his birth), which opened in 1913. It was superseded by the present Noble‚Äôs Hospital which opened in July 2003. ===Noble's Park=== Purchased in 1909 with money from the Noble Trust, Noble's Park and Recreation Grounds provide the major recreational grounds in Douglas. The first sustained, powered and controlled flight on the Isle of Man took off in July 1911 from Noble's Park, a Farnham biplane piloted by Claude Graham-White. ===Noble's Baths=== In December 1906 at a special meeting of Douglas Town Council, an application was made to the Trustees of Noble's will pointing out the desirability of the provision of public swimming baths, and requesting if they would be prepared to make provision for the same, pointing out that the Corporation had had an offer of the baths situated in Victoria St, Douglas, together with adjacent recreational venues.Mona's Herald. Wednesday, 13 December 1905; Page: 4http://www.isle-of- man.com/manxnotebook/mquart/mq05376.htm A council committee approached the owners finally agreeing on a purchase price of ¬£8,750 (¬£1,023,000 as of 2018). In addition the Borough Surveyor had costed the amount required to put the baths into working order and condition to be ¬£1,000 (¬£118,000 as of 2018). In response, John Clarke, Secretary of the Trustees, wrote to the council advising that the Trustees were willing to make a bequest of ¬£10,000 (¬£1,169,000 as of 2018), citing that the acquisition of the Victoria St baths would be of immense benefit to the town of Douglas, however citing the following proviso: * That the baths be called the Henry Bloom Noble Public Baths * All rents from properties let, and monies received from the bathers, to be expended in the maintenance of the premises, and all profits to be expended improving the baths * Arrangements to be made for free swimming classes for school children at least one day per week during the winter months * The baths to be vested in the Corporation of Douglas The inauguration ceremony of Noble's Baths took place on Wednesday 1 July 1908, and was an occasion of immense civic pride for the town. The baths served the town until they were replaced by Derby Castle Aquadrome, part of the Summerland Complex, in 1969. ===Knockaloe Farm=== Knockaloe, the Isle of Man Government's experimental farm, was created on 350 acres of waste ground in 1924. The site had been a prison encampment during the Great War, known as Knockaloe Camp, and was linked to the Douglas - Peel railway line by a branch line. A benefaction from the Henry Bloom Noble Trustees was responsible for the creation of the farm.Ramsey Courier.

Standard on Explosion Prevention Systems. National Fire Protection Association.NFPA 77. Recommended Practice on Static Electricity. National Fire Protection Association. Inerting relies on the principle that a combustible (or flammable) gas is able to undergo combustion (explode) only if mixed with air in the right proportions. The flammability limits of the gas define those proportions, i.e. the ignitable range. In combustion engineering terms, the admission of inert gas can be said to dilute the oxygen below the limiting oxygen concentration. Inerting differs from purging. Purging, by definition, ensures that an ignitable mixture never forms. Inerting makes an ignitable mixture safe by introduction of an inert gas. ==Certain inert gases are unsuitable for inerting== Because the mixture by definition is ignitable before inerting commence, it is imperative that the inerting procedure does not introduce a potential source of ignition, or an explosion will occur. NFPA 77 states that carbon dioxide from high-pressure cylinders or fire extinguishers should never be used to inert a container or vessel. The release of carbon dioxide may generate static electricity with enough energy to ignite the mixture, resulting in an explosion. The release of CO2 for fire fighting purposes has lead to several accidental explosions of which the 1954 Bitburg explosion may be the most devastating. Other unsafe processes that may generate static electricity include pneumatic transport of solids, a release of pressurized gas with solids, industrial vacuum cleaners and spray painting operationsTRBS 2153. Vermeidung von Z√ºndgefahren infolge elektrostatischer Aufladungen. [Prevention of electrostatic ignition sources.], Gemeinsame Minist. 15/16 (2009) 278 ==Other uses== The term inerting is often loosely used for any application involving an inert gas, not conforming with the technical definitions in NFPA standards. For example, marine tankers carrying low-flash products like crude oil, naphtha, or gasoline have inerting systems on board. During the voyage, the vapor pressure of these liquids is so high, that the atmosphere above the liquid (the headspace) is too rich to burn, the atmosphere is unignitable. This may change during unloading. When a certain volume of liquid is drawn from a tank, a similar volume of air will enter the tank's headspace, potentially creating an ignitable atmosphere. The inerting systems use an inert gas generator to supply inert make-up gas instead of air. This procedure is often referred to as inerting. Technically, the procedure ensures that the atmosphere in the tank's headspace remains unignitable. The gas mixture in the headspace is not inert per se, it's just unignitable. Because of its content of flammable vapors, it will burn if mixed with air. Only if enough inert gas is supplied as part of a purge-out-of-service procedure, will it be unable to burn when mixed with air. ==See also== * ATEX * Flammability limits * Limiting oxygen concentration * Purging (gas) * 1954 Bitburg explosion (jet fuel storage tank) ==External links== * Fighting Smoldering Fires in Silos ‚Äì A Cautionary Note on Using Carbon Dioxide.

He is known for the many illustrations he made as he travelled across America for Harper's Weekly with the artist Jules Tavernier. ==Life== Paul Frenzeny was born in the 1840s, probably in France, although no records of his birth have yet been found. He was an artillery officer in Maximilian's French army in Mexico. After Maximilian's execution in 1867, Frenzeny left the army and took art lessons in New York. He and Jules Tavernier were commissioned by the Illustrated American magazine Harper's Weekly to Travel from the East Coast to the West Coast to capture illustrations of the as yet unsettled West, starting in 1873 and reaching San Francisco in 1874 when they became early and active members of the Bohemian Club. Chronicling the West for Harper's: Coast to Coast with Frenzeny & Tavernier in 1873-1874, Claudine Chalmers. Norman: University of Oklahoma Press, 2013. When Jules Tavernier returned to painting full time, Paul Frenzeny continued sketching for Harper's Weekly and many other publications like Frank Leslie's Illustrated Newspaper. He became interested in San Francisco's Chinatown and drew many illustrations of that quarter between 1874 and 1882. After spending some time on the East Coast where he went on sketching, Frenzeny returned to London aboard the ship State of Nebraska as one of Buffalo Bill's Wild West riders. He subsequently gained considerable fame as a book illustrator for such masterpieces as Tolstoy's Anna Karenina and Kipling's Jungle Book. His career as a special correspondent continued until his death in London in 1906.Paul Frenzeny's Chinatown Sketches: An Artist's Fascination with San Francisco's Chinese Quarter, 1874-1882. Claudine Chalmers url=http://www.bccbooks.org/store/products/paul-frenzenys-chinatown- sketches/} Always respectful of the authenticity of his observations and sketches, Frenzeny is considered one of the most prolific and accurate special correspondents of his time.

(English tr.:) Veiled Reality: An Analysis of Quantum Mechanical Concepts. 2003, Westview Press, Boulder he coined the term veiled reality to explain why significant experiments over the preceding decades had failed to restore conventional realism. His ideas represented a different articulation of the matter and mind split that is basic to quantum theory.

The program was first made public on December 16, 2017. The program began in 2007, with funding of $22 million over the five years until the available appropriations were ended in 2012. The program began in the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency. According to the Department of Defense, the AATIP ended in 2012 after five years, however reporting suggested that U.S. government programs to investigate UFOs continued. This was confirmed in June 2020 with the acknowledgement of a similar military program, the unclassified but previously-unreported Unidentified Aerial Phenomenon Task Force. A group including Luis Elizondo, who was an AATIP program director, founded a public- benefit corporation named To The Stars Academy of Arts & Science in 2017. ==HistoryOrigins=== Senator Reid in 2002 Initiated by then Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nevada) as the Advanced Aerospace Weapon Systems Applications Program (AAWSAP) to study unexplained aerial phenomena (UAP) at the urging of Reid's friend, Nevada billionaire and governmental contractor Robert Bigelow, and with support from the late senators Ted Stevens (R-Alaska) and Daniel Inouye (D-Hawaii), the program began in the DIA in 2007 and was budgeted $22 million over its five years of operation. The United States Air Force facility known as ‚ÄúArea 51‚Äù is located in Reid's home state of Nevada. After the revived interest in the 1970s surrounding the balloon crash that is often referred to as the \\"1947 Roswell UFO incident\\", ‚ÄúArea 51‚Äù was rumored by ufologists and conspiracy theorists to be the US government's storage location for the crashed alien craft for study.Area 51 declassified: No UFOs, but lots of U-2 spy planes June 24, 2009 letter from Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid to Deputy Secretary of Defense William Lynn regarding the Advanced Aerospace Threat and Identification Program (AATIP) When interviewed in the aftermath of publicity surrounding the AATIP, Reid expressed pride in his accomplishment, and was quoted as saying \\"I think it's one of the good things I did in my congressional service. I've done something that no one has done before.\\" Reid explained the reasoning behind his sponsorship of the program by saying \\"I‚Äôm interested in science, and in helping the American public understand what the hell is going on\\" and stated that \\"hundreds and hundreds of papers\\" have been available since the program was completed and that \\"Most all of it, 80 percent at least, is public\\" adding \\"I wanted it public, it was made public, and you guys have not even looked at it.\\" A 2009 letter by Reid was published by KLAS- TV investigative journalists George Knapp and Matt Adams, where the Senator states that AATIP has made \\"much progress\\" with the \\"identification of several highly sensitive, unconventional aerospace-related findings\\" that will \\"likely lead to technology advancements\\" and recommends the creation of a special access program for specific parts of AATIP. ===Leadership and functions=== AATIP was headed by Luis Elizondo. Elizondo resigned from the Pentagon in October 2017 to protest government secrecy and opposition to the investigation, stating in a resignation letter to US Defense Secretary James Mattis that the program was not being taken seriously. Elizondo, said on December 19, 2017, that he believed there was \\"very compelling evidence we may not be alone.\\" AATIP, through a contract awarded to Bigelow Aerospace Advanced Space Studies (BAASS), has generated a 494 page report that documents alleged worldwide UFO sightings over several decades. This \\"Ten Month Report\\" has not been released to the public but focuses on reports, plans and extensive analysis of unexplained aerial phenomena. According to one former BAASS contractor, the BAASS report was only a sample of the materials provided to the Defense Intelligence Agency as \\"monthly reports were being sent to the Pentagon, in addition to annual program updates, that were all about UAP or anomalous phenomena.‚Äù The program also funded and published 38 studies. Those theoretical studies cover a range of advanced, exotic, and theoretical aerospace topics, ranging from \\"Detection and High Resolution Tracking of Vehicles at Hypersonic Velocities\\" to \\"Warp Drive, Dark Energy, and the Manipulation of Extra Dimensions.\\" Among the information that has been released by the program are \\"several short videos of military jets encountering something they couldn't identify\\". The release of those videos were part of a campaign by Luis Elizondo, now working for To The Stars Academy of Arts & Science, who said that he wanted to shed light on the program. The Navy confirmed the authenticity of the videos stating only that they depict what they consider to be \\"unidentified aerial phenomena\\". Susan Gough, a Pentagon spokeswoman, confirmed that the three videos were made by naval aviators and that they are \\"part of a larger issue of an increased number of training range incursions by unidentified aerial phenomena in recent years.‚Äù ===Successor program=== In June 2020 an existing similar program to the AATIP was acknowledged, the Unidentified Aerial Phenomenon Task Force. The unclassified but previously-unacknowledged program was made public in a June 2020 hearing of the United States Senate Select Committee on Intelligence. The UATPF program was confirmed in July 2020 as a direct successor to the AATP, and has been briefing congressional committees and aerospace employees. Reid stated in reference to the successor program that ‚ÄúIt is extremely important that information about the discovery of physical materials or retrieved craft come out.‚Äù == Aftermath and analysis == While the United States Department of Defense stated that the program was terminated in 2012, after acknowledgement of AATIP in 2017 the exact status of AATIP and its termination remained unclear. Elizondo commented that, while the effort‚Äôs government funding ended in 2012, the program continued with support from Navy and CIA officials even after his resignation . Reports in 2020 confirmed Elizondo's statement with the reporting of the U.S. government successor to the AATIP, the Unidentified Aerial Phenomenon Task Force. The materials studied by AATIP have been the subject of classified congressional hearings aimed at understanding and identifying the potential threat to the safety and security of aviators. The Navy has confirmed that, in response to inquiries by members of Congress, they have provided a series of briefings by senior naval intelligence officials as well as testimony from \\"aviators who reported hazards to aviation safety\\". The contents of those briefings are classified, but Senator Mark Warner, the vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, who participated in one of those briefings, released a statement requesting further research into \\"unexplained interference in the air\\" that could pose safety concerns for naval pilots. According to Popular Mechanics, Senate Intelligence Committee Brigadier General Richard Stapp, Director of the DoD Special Access Program Central Office, testified the mysterious objects being encountered by the military were not related to secret U.S. technology. President Donald Trump has also been briefed on the issue and has stated \\"I did have one very brief meeting on it. But people are saying they're seeing UFOs. Do I believe it? Not particularly.\\" Mick West, a science writer and skeptical investigator, suggests the public availability and confirmation of rigorous empirical studies by AATIP could change the entire UFO dynamic: ‚ÄúIt would be fantastic if there was some good evidence of something new to science. So far there isn‚Äôt‚Äù. Several researchers including Benjamin Radford and Robert Sheaffer have pointed out that mundane explanations such as the misidentification of distant jets or ordinary contrails are probably behind the incidents reported. Astrophysicist Leon Golub has stated that those reports have a number of possible explanations such as \\"bugs in the code for the imaging and display systems, atmospheric effects and reflections, neurological overload from multiple inputs during high-speed flight.\\" In a similar vein, physicist Don Lincoln pointed out that while the pilots of those reports may have thought they saw what they believed to be an \\"unidentified flying object\\", since far more plausible explanations exist, he proposed that \\"what these pilots were seeing is something with a more ordinary explanation, whether it be an instrumental glitch or some other unexplained artifact.\\" On 16 January 2019, the DIA released a list of 38 research titles pursued by the program in response to a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request by Steven Aftergood, director of the Federation of American Scientists‚Äô Project on Government Secrecy. One such research topic, ‚ÄúTraversable Wormholes, Stargates, and Negative Energy,‚Äù was led by Eric W. Davis of EarthTech International Inc, which was founded by Harold Puthoff, who was formerly involved in Project Stargate. Another project called ‚ÄúInvisibility Cloaking‚Äù was headed by German scientist Ulf Leonhardt, a professor at the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel. Yet another title, ‚ÄúWarp Drive, Dark Energy, and the Manipulation of Extra Dimensions,‚Äù was attributed to theoretical physicist Richard Obousy, director of the nonprofit Icarus Interstellar. One of those papers was released to the public by Popular Mechanics on the 14th of February 2020. The paper in question, titled \\"Clinical Medical Acute & Subacute Field Effects on Human Dermal & Neurological Tissues\\", was written by Christopher ‚ÄúKit‚Äù Green, formerly a CIA agent, forensic clinician and neuroscientist, who described it as \\"focused on forensically assessing accounts of injuries that could have resulted from claimed encounters with UAP\\". In June 2019, former Senator Reid defended the legacy of the AATIP, saying \\"When I was contacted by the New York Times, they said they wanted to do a story on UFOs and the money you got, the $22 million. And I said I am happy to do that story, as long as we are not talking about little green men. If you want to talk about science, I'm all in. And that is how I looked at this.\\" ==Media reporting== Although the program was not named specifically, program leader Elizondo was quoted in The Huffington Post in late October 2017. Several days earlier, Elizondo announced his involvement in founding an aerospace, science, paranormal and entertainment company called, To the Stars Academy for Arts and Science. AATIP came to a broader public attention on 16 December 2017 - in three news stories - in The Washington Post, Politico and The New York Times: *The story in the Times included doubts about alien visitation expressed by James Oberg, a space writer and UFO debunker, and Sara Seager, a scientific specialist on the atmospheres of extrasolar planets. Oberg said \\"There are plenty of prosaic events and human perceptual traits that can account for these stories\\", although he welcomed further research. It also reported that \\"Robert Bigelow, a billionaire entrepreneur and longtime friend of Mr. Reid, received most of the money allocated for the Pentagon program.\\" *The Washington Post story reported that Elizondo was responsible for the public release of footage taken by US fighter jets that appears to show aerial objects maneuvering in inexplicable ways in the USS Princeton aerial object incident. The newspaper also stated that it had conducted several interviews with Elizondo and Christopher Mellon, who is associated with Elizondo in the private venture named \\"To the Stars Academy for Arts and Sciences\\". *In the Politico story Pentagon spokeswoman Dana White confirmed that Elizondo had been the director of AATIP Politico published a statement by an anonymous former congressional staff member that, \\"After a while[,] the consensus was [that] we really couldn't find anything of substance,\\" ... \\"They produced reams of paperwork. After all of that there was really nothing there that we could find. It all pretty much dissolved from that reason alone‚Äîand the interest level was losing steam. We only did it for a couple of years.\\" On 22 May 2019, Pentagon spokesman Christopher Sherwood finally confirmed to the New York Post that the program \\"did pursue research and investigation into unidentified aerial phenomena,\\" dispelling rumors that the program only focused on theoretical physics. On 26 May 2019, The New York Times reported that US Navy pilots fully briefed AATIP about encounters they had with unexplained objects during the summer of 2014 to March 2015 while flying at high altitudes off the East Coast of the United States. Nonetheless, president Donald Trump, who said he had a short briefing on AATIP, said he is skeptical of Navy sightings of UFOs. On 1 June 2019, The Intercept published an article with an excerpt from an email obtained via FOIA request. The excerpt called into question Elizondo's position at AATIP. Yes, AATIP existed, and it ‚Äúdid pursue research and investigation into unidentified aerial phenomena,‚Äù Pentagon spokesperson Christopher Sherwood confirmed. However, he added: ‚ÄúElizondo had no responsibilities with regard to the AATIP program while he worked in OUSDI [the Office of Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence], up until the time he resigned effective 10/4/2017.‚Äù To the Stars has attempted to clarify this with an email: ‚ÄúThe program was initially run out of [the Defense Intelligence Agency] but when Lue took it over in 2010 as Director, he ran it out of the Office for the Secretary of Defense (OSD) under the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence (USDI).‚Äùhttps://theintercept.com/2019/06/01/ufo-unidentified- history-channel-luis-elizondo-pentagon/ A February 2020 Popular Mechanics article by UFO investigative writer and retired police lieutenant Tim McMillan said that Bigelow Aerospace Advanced Space Studies (BAASS) was contracted under the auspices of the AATIP program to study UFO reports and purported paranormal phenomena. According to Steven Aftergood, Director for the Federation of American Scientists Project on Government Secrecy, the AAWSAP contract \\"sounds like it was a good deal for the contractor. But it would be hard to argue that either the military or the public got their money‚Äôs worth.\\" On July 23, 2020, The New York Times reported that while former Senator Harry Reid \\"believed that crashes of objects of unknown origin may have occurred and that retrieved materials should be studied; he did not say that crashes had occurred and that retrieved materials had been studied secretly for decades.\\" News reports also repeated a claim made by Eric W. Davis, a former employee of Harold E. Puthoff (co-founder of UFO-promoting company To the Stars) that an \\"off-world vehicle\\" might be in the possession of the US government.https://nypost.com/2020/07/23/pentagon-ufo-unit-to-publicly- release-some-findings/ ==See also== *Pentagon UFO videos *Project Sign *Project Grudge *Project Blue Book *Robertson Panel *Condon Committee *UFO sightings in outer space *1952 Washington, D.C.

Since 1905, Bart√≥k had been travelling around Eastern Europe, especially around Hungary and Romania, collecting folk songs and tunes which would later become some of the basis of a significant part of his production as a composer. It was especially in 1908 that Bart√≥k started to become increasingly interested in the tonal aspect of his works, which started to show a distinctive flavor to that of other contemporary composers. Bart√≥k composed these four short pieces for solo piano between 1909 and 1910. The set was never formally premiered and was initially published in 1912 by R√≥zsav√∂lgyi & T√°rsa in Budapest. It was only partially first performed in Budapest in 1917 by fellow pianist Ern≈ë Dohn√°nyi. == Structure == The set consists of four short compositions for piano with varying tempo markings. However, all of the pieces in the set are characterised for being slow and pesante. The whole set takes around 8 minutes to perform: The texture of all four dirges is consistently simple and centered around octatonicism and pentatonic structures.

She was first known as a member of schlager band Wolkenfrei and later began working as a solo artist following the band's split. She chose her stage name as a reference to her birth month, which is spelled Mai () in German. == Life and career == Vanessa Mai completed a media designer apprenticeship. She had one of her first performances as a singer in the school musical The Wonderful Wizard of Oz.RTL Punkt 12 (13 July 2015, 12:00) Before that, she had occasionally accompanied her father, Croatian-born musician, with the tambourine. In 2008, aged 15, she took part in the hip-hop world championship in Las Vegas, placing last, as part of the dance formation Getting Craz'd, who were German champions. In 2012, she met Andrea Berg's stepson Andreas Ferber, who became her manager, in a Stuttgart club, and began dating him in 2013. After getting engaged in early 2016, they got married in June 2017. The civil marriage took place on 6 June, while the church wedding took place in Mallorca on 12 June. === 2012‚Äì2015: Wolkenfrei === In the summer of 2012, then-singer of Wolkenfrei, Heike Wanner, left the band for health reasons. While attending a concert of her father's band Musik-Express at the Sonnenhof in Aspach, Vanessa Mai was enlisted as a singer by Wolkenfrei member Marc Fischer. On 19 July 2013, their d√©but single \\"Jeans, T-Shirts und Freiheit\\" (English: \\"Jeans, T-Shirts, and freedom\\") was released. It was followed by their d√©but studio album Endlos verliebt (English: \\"Endlessly in Love\\") in February 2014, which charted in Germany, Austria, and Switzerland. In January 2015, it was announced that Mai was the new face of the campaign Mein Herz schl√§gt Schlager. She promoted it through an ad as well as with the song \\"Mein Herz schl√§gt Schlager\\", which was released on a sampler album belonging to the project. In April 2015, Marc Fischer and Stefan Kinski announced that they were leaving Wolkenfrei, leading to the project being represented only by Mai (mostly as \\"Wolkenfrei-Star Vanessa Mai\\"). \\"Wolke 7\\", the first single from Wolkenfrei's second studio album, was released on 22 May. The album, titled Wachgek√ºsst, was released on 10 July. A day before, Deutsches Musik Fernsehen had dedicated a 65-minute television special to Mai and to the album. Due to Mai's extensive television presence, including an appearance on Florian Silbereisen's ARD show Die Besten im Sommer with the song \\"Wolke 7\\", the album reached place 7 of the German albums chart and also charted in Austria and Switzerland. The single \\"Wolke 7\\" reached place 54 in Germany and 71 in Austria. On 18 September, \\"Wachgek√ºsst\\", the album's title track, was released as its second single. On 9 October, Mai's first live album (still as Wolkenfrei), Wachgek√ºsst (Live), was released. The last single \\"In all deinen Farben\\" (English: \\"In All Your Colours\\") was released on 11 December, followed a week later by a non-album Christmas single titled \\"Ein Engel in der Weihnachtszeit\\" (English: \\"An Angel at Christmas Time\\"). === 2016‚Äìpresent: Abandonment of the Wolkenfrei name and solo career === Vanessa Mai (2018) From January to May 2016, Vanessa Mai was a judge on the thirteenth season of Deutschland sucht den Superstar, the German version of Pop Idol and American Idol.

The judo sport in West Germany was organized as a sport from 1949 to 1954 in the Deutscher Athletenbund (DAB). On 8 August 1953 the German Judo Association was founded by Dan-bearers of the German Dan-Kollegium (DDK) like Alfred Rhode of the 1st German Judo-Club (1st DJC in Frankfurt am Main). Alfred Rhode had introduced judo in Germany with the 1st DJC at his Frankfurt summer school in 1932. The separate areas of responsibility of the two associations DJB and DDK complemented each other when the DJB was founded. The DDK was responsible for the Dan bearers, teacher training, dissemination and teaching of judo and examinations. The DJB was from 1955 alone responsible for the competition events - for national and international tournaments and championships, after the DAB had transferred in December 1954 its responsibility for the judo sport to the DJB. The DJB was recognized in 1956 by the German Sports Federation and worked together until 1990 together with the DDK. On 2 February 1991, the German Judo Federation of the FRG (DJB) and the German Judo Association of the GDR (DJV) united in Passau under the name German Judo Association. Judo Judges organize judo championships in Germany as well as other professional associations in Germany.

Gray became the first woman to lead a department of science or engineering at MIT when she became the co-director of the Harvard‚ÄìMIT Program of Health Sciences and Technology in 1987. She has developed multidisciplinary programs at MIT. Her research focuses on understanding and preventing Osteoarthritis, and her team developed the imaging technology dGEMRIC, now used to examine cartilage. == Early life == Martha Gray was raised in the Detroit area with three sisters and one brother. Her mother was a nurse and her father was an engineer. In high school, she thought her career might be as a nursery school or elementary school teacher. Martha Gray received her BS degree in computer science from Michigan State University in 1978, SM degree in electrical engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1981, and PhD in medical engineering through the Harvard‚ÄìMIT Program of Health Sciences and Technology in 1986. She then completed her postdoctoral work at Tufts University and the State University of New York, Stony Brook. == Career == Gray joined the Harvard-MIT Program of Health Sciences and Technology (HST) faculty in 1987 and became co-director of the department in 1995, joining Joseph Bonventre, making her the first woman to lead a science or engineering department at MIT. During Gray's term as director of HST, the faculty was expanded from 5 to over 60 members, initiatives such as the Biomedical Enterprise Program and the Graduate Education in Medical Sciences were started, and the Biomatrix mentoring program was established for undergraduate students interested in studying health sciences. Gray held the co-director position until July 1, 2008. In 2010, Gray became the founding director of the Madrid-MIT M+Vision Consortium. This program brings together \\"leaders in science, medicine, engineering, business, and the public sector dedicated to catalyzing change in Madrid‚Äôs healthcare innovation ecosystem by accelerating translational research and encouraging entrepreneurship.\\" In 2014, the program was recognized by the Spanish Foundation for Technology and Health \\"for its contributions to healthcare technology innovation and economic development in Spain. And most recently, Gray is the program director of the IMPACT program at MIT, established in 2016. The IMPACT program seeks to provide post-doctoral students with mentorship so their work can have the most impact on society, by focusing on the societal value of one's work and improving communication to the public. Gray's biomedical research has focused on arthritis, as she had a longstanding interest in connective tissue in joints, and in the causes of tissue degeneration, whether they are genetic or environmental. Early experiments involved applying mechanical forces to cartilage tissue ex-vivo and observing the effects to cells. From there Gray moved into cartilage imaging technology. Frequently, X-rays would be used to evaluate the condition of cartilage, but cartilage doesn't show up on an X-ray image. Instead, doctors judge by the distance between bones, which do appear from the X-ray, to evaluate the state of the cartilage between them. Inspired by a colleague's work in cardiac imaging, Gray worked with them and developed Delayed gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging of cartilage (dGEMRIC). == Societies and awards == Gray is a member of the following societies and associations. * Fellow, American Association for the Advancement of Science * Fellow, American Institute for Medical and Biological Engineering ** Vice President at Large (2007-2009) ** Chair, College of Fellows (2005-2006) * Fellow, Biomedical Engineering Society ** Treasurer (2009-2011) * Associate Editor of the Annual Review of Biomedical Engineering * Orthopedic Research Society ** Secretary (2008-2011) Gray was the recipient of the 2007 Kappa Delta Elizabeth Winston Lanier Award and the 2011 ORS Women‚Äôs Leadership Forum Award both from the American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons.

He did his doctoral studies in astronomy at the University of Toronto. Since 1968 he has been an academic of the Faculty of Physical and Mathematical Sciences of the University of Chile, and since 1987 he has been a full professor of that house of studies. He was director of the University of Chile's Department of Astronomy from 1997 to 2000. Between 1979 and 1984 he headed the Scientific Project of Search for Supernovas at Cerro El Roble and was part of Project Cal√°n Tololo, a Chilean-American initiative that featured the joint work of the University of Chile with the Cerro Tololo Interamerican Observatory, in the search for supernovas. The Cal√°n Tololo project gave contemporary astrophysics tools for measuring the universe more precisely, calculations that years later would be key for a group of American astronomers to follow these supernova studies, being part of the theory of accelerating expansion of the universe by dark energy. He has not been recognized as such since all his mathematical calculations were provided to Harvard University on the condition that they would only perform a mathematical modeling, which allowed that group of American scientists to win the Nobel Prize in 2011.

Born in Briestfield in the West Riding of Yorkshire, Dixon attended a Sunday School at which his father was the superintendent. His mother died when he was seven, and he then began working with his father underground at a coal mine. His father died seven years later, and Dixon then moved to Gomersal, where he continued working as a miner. In Gomersal, Dixon attended classes at the mechanics' institution, and in 1844 heard David Swallow speak about trade unionism. He decided to emulate Swallow, and founded a local trade union. He married in 1850, and soon moved to Drighlington, where he became secretary of the local miners' union. This became part of the Adwalton and Drighlington Miners' Association, which undertook a major strike in 1862. Dixon advised against strike action, but was defeated in a vote. The strike was unsuccessful, leading to a wage reduction of 30% and the victimisation of the union leaders; although Dixon travelled the district in an attempt to find work, he could not find a colliery willing to employ him. Only fifteen months later did he finally find work at Snydale. The Adwalton and Drighlington union had been largely destroyed by the 1862 strike, but Dixon was able to partially rebuild it, and in 1866 took it into a merger with the West Yorkshire Miners' Association (WYMA). In exchange, he was employed as assistant secretary of the WYMA for three days a week, and in January 1867, he was elected as full-time secretary of the union. He moved to Methley, then later to Normanton, to manage the union's affairs, and in Normanton was also elected as chairman of the school board in 1873. Dixon was also active in the Miners' National Union, and gave evidence to the 1873 Select Committee on Coal. He died in 1876, still in office. ==References== Category:1828 births Category:1876 deaths Category:Leaders of British trade unions Category:People from Dewsbury Category:Trade unionists from Yorkshire ","title":"John Dixon (trade unionist)"},{"id":"56066305","text":"This is a list of Greek football transfers for the 2017‚Äì18 winter transfer window by club.

It was initially divided into two districts: Wakefield and Methley; and Leeds. The new union provided a formal structure to support strikers, and all miners in the district found themselves out of work after 7 October, when colliery owners agreed a general lock-out. The union tried to negotiate a settlement, but the colliery owners refused to meet with them. Public opinion turned against the employers, and during November and December the mines reopened, agreeing to take the miners back on with smaller wage reductions, the repeal of some of the most unpopular rules of work, and to permit miners to remain members of the union. Strengthened by the successful industrial action, the WYMA tried to organise a national union. Although conferences took place in Leeds and Ashton-under-Lyne, no permanent arrangement was made. Instead, a period of industrial peace in the district led to a lack of interest in the union, which became moribund by 1861. However, renewed wage cuts in 1862 led to a revival the following year. This new union succeeded in minimising wage cuts and maintaining conditions. It also organised a national miners' conference in November 1863 which finally founded the Miners' National Union. The union remained in existence, but undertook little activity. In 1866, the small Adwalton and Drighlington Miners' Association merged into the WYMA, with its secretary, John Dixon, becoming assistant secretary of the WYMA, then secretary the following year, and membership reaching a peak of nearly 4,000. A boom in the price of coal enabled it to build up some reserves, but a large number of miners in Morley left the union, and further lock-outs left other miners unable to sustain membership. By 1870, the union had only 480 members, and was kept afloat only by a loan of ¬£100 from the South Yorkshire Miners' Association (SYMA). In 1871, the WYMA proposed amalgamation with the SYMA, but the SYMA rejected the idea. Another recovery in the price of coal enable the union to successfully campaign for wage increases and some improvements in working conditions. This led more miners to join the union, and in 1873 it was able to again employ an assistant secretary, Benjamin Pickard winning the post by an overwhelming majority of votes. It increased benefits for ill and injured miners, and financially supported Thomas Burt and Alexander Macdonald's campaigns in the 1874 UK general election. By this time, membership had reached a new peak of 12,379. A lock-out from October to December was resolved by arbitration organised by the union. Dixon died in 1876, and Pickard succeeded him as secretary. Low coal prices led to hardship among miners over the next few years, but there was relative industrial peace until 1878, when colliery owners unilaterally decided to introduce riddles, filtering coal dust from mined material and therefore reducing the weight of each cartload - a major issue for miners who were paid by weight. The union negotiated a bonus of 1.5d per ton for riddled coal. In an attempt to increase membership, miners were allowed to become members immediately on their first payment of dues, although they did not gain union benefits until they had at least thirteen weeks of continuous membership. In 1880, the union agreed to a sliding scale of wages, linked to the average selling price of coal, hoping that this would reduce conflict, and lead to increased wages if, as expected, coal prices went up. But these hopes were not fulfilled, as wages were instead reduced by 2.5% in October, and some colleries imposed greater reductions, arguing that they would otherwise have to close. Wages did not change at the end of the year, and increased again by only 2.5% in April 1881. By 1881, the SYMA was in financial difficulties, and it finally agreed to merge with the WYMA.

Alajoki used to be famous for hundreds of simple barn buildings for hay storage scattered on the plain, now mostly gone. Another typical building type for the area were the \\"Alajoki saunas\\", small huts along the Kyronjoki river where field workers and cow milkers would stay and socialize during the busy summer months. Despite their name, most huts did not in fact include a sauna stove. The name may derive from the fact that many of the log-frame huts were previously used as sauna buildings at farms and then disassembled, drawn by horses to the riverside and put together again for accommodation.M√§ntysaari, Maaria: Alajoen jokisaunat ja luhtaladot.

It is best known for such long-produced games as Tiddledy Winks and Game of India, as well as such baby-boomer favorites as Green Ghost and television tie-in board games for such characters and series as Atom Ant, The Flintstones, Gomer Pyle, U.S.M.C., Perry Mason and Tom and Jerry. ==HistoryEarly years=== Around the turn of the 20th century, Charles Raizen took a summer job with a manufacturer of embroidery patterns. Years later, he found a method of transferring images using friction, and circa 1915, the company became the Friction Transfer Pattern Company, first located on 2nd Street, between Avenues C and D, in Manhattan, then at 113-115 University Place. It quickly found that children enjoyed transferring the friction patterns, and the company shifted toward children's products such as Art-Toy Transfer Pictures. In 1917, Raizen bought the company and renamed it Transogram, but using 1915 as the founding date in its company logo (see above). Moving to 200 Fifth Avenue, (abstract; full article requires subscription) the company developed the Toy Research Institute in order to test toys with input by a child psychologist, leading to the 1920s tagline that its toys were \\"Kid Tested\\". The company also began licensing media properties, manufacturing the likes of a Little Orphan Annie set of clothes pins. After producing toys, play sets and activity items, the company in 1929 produced its first game-like product, Orje, The Mystic Prophet, which one historian calls \\"a solitaire fortunetelling pastime\\". In early 1939, the company announced that its new game Movie Millions would have a marketing push, headed by advertising manager Lee Sheldon, in magazines, trade magazines, newspapers and radio. (abstract; full article requires subscription) ===Later years=== In 1955, Transogram introduced its first TV- series licensed board game, Dragnet. In 1960, Transogram was one of seven toy- makers, including Ideal and Parker Brothers, that the Federal Trade Commission accused of violating antitrust law by allegedly soliciting discriminatory advertising allowances from suppliers. (abstract; full article requires subscription) Transogram advertised on television in 1968 for the first time in six years, with a million-dollar campaign centered on Green Ghost and Hocus Pocus, its two glow-in-the-dark games; Kabala, a future-telling game; and the printing kit Inkless Printing. The TV commercials were produced by the advertising agency Smith / Greenland. (abstract; full article requires subscription) ===Going public and final years=== Following a previous incorporation in New York, the Transogram Company incorporated in Pennsylvania on September 4, 1959. In May 1962, Transogram made an initial public offering of 196,000 shares of common stock from Charles Raizen's private account. It sold for US$10 a share. Raizen retained control with 61.4 percent of outstanding stock.Note: It was not listed a recent issue in The New York Times until August.

After this, the Puerto Rico Olympic Committee withdrew the recognition of the Winter Sports Federation for the island territory, effectively ending any hopes for athletes competing at the Winter Olympics. Alpine skier Kristina Krone qualified to represent the territory at both the 2010 and 2014 Winter Olympics in Vancouver and Sochi respectively. However, both times the Puerto Rico Olympic Committee refused to even acknowledge her qualification and the territory did not compete. In December 2017, the Puerto Rico Olympic Committee allowed a six-month temporary membership to the Winter Sports Federation, thus allowing the territory to compete at the 2018 Games.

The lineup remained stable for Focus 3, before van der Linden left in October 1973 due to musical differences with van Leer and Akkerman. He was replaced by Colin Allen, and Focus released their fourth album Hamburger Concerto in 1974. Allen was later fired after recording just one track for the follow-up album. Released in 1975, Mother Focus featured drums recorded by session musician David Kemper. van der Linden subsequently returned, although by early 1976 he had departed again and Kemper had taken his place on tour. The tour in question also featured new guitarist Philip Catherine, who joined on short notice after Akkerman suddenly left in February due to increasing tensions with van Leer. By mid-1977, the group's lineup had changed drastically ‚Äì P. J. Proby took over lead vocal duties, Eef Albers joined as a second guitarist, and Steve Smith replaced Kemper on drums. Focus con Proby was released in 1978; the band never performed live with Proby, returning to tour the following year with new drummer Richard James. After the tour concluded in August 1978, the group disbanded. ===1985 onwards=== In 1984, van Leer and Akkerman reunited for a set of recordings under their own names, which were released the following March as Focus. The newly reformed group was intended to tour in promotion of the release, but disbanded again shortly after the album's release due to continued tensions between the two. Five years later, the pair reunited with former members Bert Ruiter and Pierre van der Linden for a performance of new and old material on a television special in the Netherlands, although it did not evolve into a full reformation. van Leer and Akkerman subsequently performed together again at the North Sea Jazz Festival in 1993, before van Leer attempted another short-lived Focus reformation with Ruiter, original drummer Hans Cleuver and new guitarist Menno Gootjes in 1997. ===2002 onwards=== In early 2002, Thijs van Leer reformed Focus again with new guitarist Jan Dum√©e, bassist Bobby Jacobs and drummer Ruben van Roon. Bert Smaak replaced van Roon shortly after the reformation to complete work on the comeback album Focus 8, and remained until August 2004 when van der Linden returned to the band. Dum√©e was replaced by Niels van der Steenhoven in time for Focus 9 / New Skin in 2006, before Gootjes returned for a second stint in 2010. After the band released Focus X and Golden Oldies, Udo Pannekeet replaced long-time bassist Jacobs in December 2016. The Focus Family Album and Focus 11 followed in 2017 and 2018, respectively. ==MembersCurrent=== {  border=\\"1\\" width=100% - !width=\\"75\\"Image !width=\\"160\\"Name !width=\\"90\\"Years active !width=\\"160\\"Instruments !Release contributions -  Thijs van Leer   all Focus releases -  Pierre van der Linden    -  Menno Gootjes  guitar  -  Udo Pannekeet 2016‚Äìpresent bass  } ===Former=== {  border=\\"1\\" width=100% - !width=\\"75\\"Image !width=\\"160\\"Name !width=\\"90\\"Years active !width=\\"160\\"Instruments !Release contributions -  Jan Akkerman    -  Hans Cleuver   rowspan=\\"2\\" -  Martijn Dresden 1969‚Äì1970 rowspan=\\"3\\" -  Cyril Havermans 1970‚Äì1971  -  Bert Ruiter   -  Colin Allen 1973‚Äì1974   -  David Kemper  drums  -  Philip Catherine 1976‚Äì1978 rowspan=\\"2\\"guitar  -  Eef Albers 1977‚Äì1978 rowspan=\\"3\\"Focus con Proby (1978) -  P.

Hwasser was the son of the vicar in √Ñlvkarleby parish, Lars Adolph Hwasser, and Margareta Catharina Djurman. He grew up in the vicarage, receiving his schooling at home. When he was 14 years old he took the finishing exam, studentexamen, in Uppsala, and went on to study medicine there. In 1813 he finished his studies and defended his dissertation to become a Doctor of Medicine. The subject of his dissertation was the treatment of fevers with cold water. Hwasser joined the Swedish troops as a military doctor in the War of the Sixth Coalition (part of the Napoleonic Wars) in 1813-14. He served in Germany and Norway. After his return to Sweden, he pursued further studies in surgery at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm. In 1817, at the age of 26, he was appointed Professor of medicine in Turku. While he was there, he gradually changed his view of medicine, beginning to believe that humans caused their own illness, while healing was a divine force. In 1827, the Great Fire of Turku led to the move of the faculty of medicine, together with the rest of the Royal Academy of Turku, to Helsinki. Hwasser moved, too, but he only remained in Helsinki until 1830, when he applied for a professorship in Uppsala. He returned to Uppsala in order to fight against plans to locate all medical education in Sweden at the Karolinska Institute. He would continue his vocal criticism of Karolinska for 30 years, something that made him somewhat controversial. Hwasser was a well- liked teacher of medicine among students and other teachers, and the number of medical students increased during his years as professor. His theories about the philosophical underpinnings of medicine were however less popular. He was also outspoken about his views on public morality and decency, and in his last years he expressed deep admiration for Tsar Nicholas I as the defender of Christendom against liberalism, socialism and godlessness. Hwasser was a member of the Royal Society of Sciences in Uppsala, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences and the Royal Swedish Academy of Letters, History and Antiquities. In 1854 he was made a member of the Swedish Academy. While a member of the latter institution he wrote various texts on literary criticism, mainly focusing on public morality. He married Anna Charlotta Wadsberg in 1817. She died in 1853. He resigned his professorship in 1855, at the age of 65, but continued teaching until his death in 1860. He is buried at Uppsala old cemetery. ==References== Category:1790 births Category:1860 deaths Category:Uppsala University faculty Category:Members of the Swedish Academy Category:Burials at Uppsala old cemetery Category:19th-century Swedish physicians Category:Swedish expatriates in Finland ","title":"Israel Hwasser"},{"id":"56067048","text":"The √úsk√ºdar Ferry Terminal, also known as the √úsk√ºdar Pier (), is a ferry terminal in √úsk√ºdar, Istanbul, located along Pa≈üa Limanƒ± Avenue on the Bosporus strait. It is used by Municipal ≈ûehir Hatlarƒ± (City Lines) ferries as well as private Dentur ferries. ≈ûehir Hatlarƒ± ferries operate to several piers along the Bosporus and Golden Horn, while Dentur operates frequent ferry service to Kabata≈ü and Be≈üikta≈ü. The first √úsk√ºdar Pier was built in 1852 and is notable as the first public ferry landing built on the Bosporus strait. The modern terminal was built in 1965. √úsk√ºdar Terminal is located near √úsk√ºdar Square in central √úsk√ºdar, from which connections to bus, train and metro service are available. Another private ferry operator, Turyol, operates ferry service from its pier just north of √úsk√ºdar terminal. ==History== √úsk√ºdar Pier was first opened in 1853 by an Ottoman ferry company, ≈ûirket-i Hayriye as the companies first ferry pier on the Bosporus strait. The first pier was located slightly inland, near the Fountain of Ahmed III. The first ferry service from √úsk√ºdar operated to Kabata≈ü, on the European shore of the Bosporus. As √úsk√ºdar grew in the late 19th century, ferry service also increased and the existing pier was not large enough to handle the capacity. In 1905, ≈ûirket-i Hayriye began operating ferry service from Be≈üikta≈ü to Haydarpa≈üa station, via √úsk√ºdar. Passengers used this route to connect to railway service east into Anatolia. In 1906, the first pier was demolished and replaced by a larger pier. The inside of the pier consisted of decorative tiles, with ticket counters and bird cages. ≈ûirket-i Hayriye was bought by the state-owned ≈ûehir Hatlarƒ± municipal ferry company in 1945. In the 1950s, the popularity of ferries grew along with passenger ridership. To increase capacity, a larger terminal was built in 1965 and remains in operation to this day. ==Services== √úsk√ºdar is a main pier for the municipal ferry service. ≈ûehir Hatlarƒ± operates ferries to 20 other piers on the Bosporus and Golden Horn, while Dentur operates to two other piers. Among these destinations are Be≈üikta≈ü, Kabata≈ü, Emin√∂n√º, Karak√∂y and Kadƒ±k√∂y. Ferries leave √úsk√ºdar at an average of 10 minute intervals, making it one of the busiest ferry terminals in Turkey. ==References== Category:Ferry piers in Istanbul Category:1853 establishments in the Ottoman Empire Category:√úsk√ºdar ","title":"√úsk√ºdar Ferry Terminal"},{"id":"56067079","text":"In√©dito (AKA The Unknown and originally titled Tom Jobim for its original 1987 Release) was a privately commissioned studio album by Ant√¥nio Carlos Jobim, released in 1987 in a limited edition to commemorate his 60th birthday, and re-released in 1995 for the general public. It was released in the United States in 2006 as The Unknown, by DRG Records. The album was a career retrospective that featured many of Jobim‚Äôs most famous songs, along with lesser-known material that he had never previously recorded. He later claimed that In√©dito was the album he most enjoyed recording and believed it was one of the best works of his career. ==Background== In 1987, Jobim celebrated his 60th birthday. To mark the occasion, Brazilian industrial conglomerate Odebrecht commissioned Tom to record a limited edition album, allowing him financial and artistic control. The project was overseen by Vera de Alencar, Jobim‚Äôs friend and the museologist responsible for his archive of music and papers, and Jairo Severiano, a noted historian of Brazilian popular music. Jobim worked on the recordings around the same time as Passarim (Verve, 1987), which was his first album in seven years. Four thousand copies of the private recordings were distributed to schools, libraries, museums, and Odebrecht customers. A year after Jobim‚Äôs death, his family reached an agreement with Odebrecht to release the album to the general public through BMG Brazil. ==Recording== As part of the agreement to do the album, Jobim stipulated that recording be done at his house in the Jardim Bot√¢nico district, Rio de Janeiro. His piano room was converted into a recording studio, with Carlos de Andrade serving as sound engineer. Tracks were cut between May 13 and August 30, 1987. \\"We began around eleven in the evening,\\" recalled Severiano, \\"when there was no more movement in the streets and the danger of noise leakage, and finished no earlier than two in the morning.\\" Jobim added, \\"In this house of mine, one hears a frog croak from a 200 meter distance.\\" For musicians, Jobim relied on Banda Nova, his touring and recording group that included close friends and family, such as his wife Ana, daughter Elizabeth, and son Paulo, along with Jaques and Paula Morelenbaum, and Danilo Caymmi and his wife Simone. \\"We recorded absolutely at ease, without the usual industry pressures,\\" said Paulo Jobim. ==Critical reception== In√©dito received uniformly positive reviews when it was released to the general public. The Daily Telegraph hailed the album as \\"a lost gem by Brazil's finest songwriter,\\" and critic Mark Hudson wrote in his review that \\"the re-release of an extraordinary, yet little-known album from Jobim's twilight years sheds new light on this fascinating figure and on the whole bossa phenomenon.\\" Hudson lauded In√©idto's \\"fabulous sweep\\" showing the range of musical genres and artists that influenced Jobim‚Äôs work, such as West Coast jazz, European modernism, Debussy, and Brazilian composer Pixinguinha. \\"You get a sense of this rich blend of influences on Inedito. The siren sweep of the female voices brings a sense of exaltation with echoes of African religious chants, the Catholic liturgy and the fugitive textures that have all fed into Brazilian music. And yet an element of kitsch never leaves the picture. . . . For all the sophistication of his musical vision, Jobim is a popular composer, who never loses sight of his music's origins in the bars and beach parties of Rio. Like his contemporary Burt Bacharach, he does extraordinary things with melody, while making sure to give the man in the street an easily digested emotional pay-off. It is this complex mingling of the high and the low, of the refined and the faintly naff, that makes Jobim and bossa nova itself such a compelling phenomenon.\\" John Lannert at Billboard called the album \\"a critical masterpiece\\", while The Wall Street Journal referred to In√©dito as a \\"fully realized gem. . . . The up-tempo songs are lovingly redefined . . . and the explorations of Jobim's more brooding, somber works are startlingly effective. 'The Unknown' captures the breadth and depth of Jobim's remarkable body of work, which remains the wellspring of a thriving musical movement.\\" Jobim‚Äôs music \\"shines in the hands of its eternal master,\\" claimed Philadelphia Weekly. \\"For those familiar with this engaging, jazz-friendly genre, Jobim's well-known compositions are included here: the coastal-breezed 'Wave,' the bouncy 'Desafinado' and of course the ubiquitous 'Garota de Ipanema' which Jobim refashions into a new acoustic 'remixed' version. Also included are several lesser-known compositions, from the brooding waltzy piano solo 'Imagina' to the ebullient 'Derradeira Primavera.'\\" In his AllMusic review of In√©dito, Richard S. Ginell said, \\"The feeling of saudade is very much front and center on Jobim's birthday present to himself -- he later said that this was his favorite album -- and all of his connoisseurs should try to hunt it down.\\" ==Track listing== All songs written by Ant√¥nio Carlos Jobim, lyricsts indicated.

(Bandleader and Musician Jack Parnell was appointed musical director for ATV in 1956). At ATV much music was prepared for so many shows. The orchestrations department at Elstree was large and famous, boasting such arrangers and orchestrators on its books as Eric Rogers, David Lindup, Arthur Greenslade, Max Harris, Kenny Powell, Derek Scott and Johnnie Spence. Parnell held the post until 1982. He also composed The Muppet Show Theme for ITC Entertainment and served as conductor for the entire series. In the late 1950s, Spence became piano accompanist to the singer Anne Shelton, a popular English vocalist. Spence's early work was predominantly in comedy records for Parlophone, occasionally working alongside Sir George Martin, who would later find fame as producer of The Beatles. Spence's credits at this time included such work as the Bernard Cribbins single \\"Right Said Fred\\". In 1960, George Martin decided to use Johnnie Spence, who had just been signed to Parlophone as a musical director, for the upcoming session with his new recording-act Terry Parsons, aka Matt Monro. George Martin threw everything at this session, including a 23-piece orchestra for a big sound. Two tape machines were running at the same time: one in stereo and one in mono, doubling the cost of tape. From 2 November recording session emerged a song that reached no. 3 in the UK Singles Chart: \\"Portrait Of My Love\\", the song that won Monro the Ivor Novello Award for \\"The Most Outstanding Song Of 1960\\" from the Songwriter's Guild of Great Britain.

Their two children were born on 2 April 1965 (Sarah Jane) and 15 February 1973 (Jonathan Adam). Jonathan was known for his close relationship with Michael Jackson, whom he got to know while attending the Buckley School with Tito Jackson's son, who was also five years old at the time. The family lived in Ewell, Epsom (Surrey) England, before moving to the United States permanently. From 1969 onwards, the family lived in rented houses in California, close to Los Angeles recording studios. Because of his work as an arranger/conductor/composer, he made the decision in the summer of 1976 to take the leap and move to the US full-time with his family. They eventually moved into a comfortable home in Encino, California. He was able to secure lucrative work arranging and directing music for both television shows and movies. Spence had just signed a contract with the Joey Bishop Show for ABC network when fate struck; he died suddenly at home in Los Angeles of a heart attack on 15 August 1977, at the age of 41. The funeral took place at Forest Lawn Memorial Park, Hollywood Hills on 20 August 1977 with among the pallbearers Tom Jones and Gilbert O'Sullivan. Matt Monro was holidaying in Barbados and could not get a flight to Los Angeles in time for the funeral. \\"Johnnie Spence was one of the best musicians I've ever known.He was a marvellous arranger, a great band man and his scores for brass, saxes, rhythm and strings were the best I've ever had, much better than I could do. His work with Matt Monro was one of the highlights, one of the joys of my life. He always turned up with a very tasteful score. He was a lovely man, a great character. He did tend to burn the candle at both ends though, and in the middle! It was a great tragedy when he died, it was such a shock, he was so young\\"- Sir George Martin.Michele Monro, The Singer's Singer - the Life and Music of Matt Monro. , (TitanBooks/2010) ==References== Category:1936 births Category:1977 deaths Category:British music arrangers ","title":"Johnnie Spence"},{"id":"56067176","text":"Albania is scheduled to compete at the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea, from 9 to 25 February 2018.

He graduated from The English High School, where he was an All-scholastic quarterback for the city championship-winning football team as well as a member of the hockey team. At the start of World War I, Rugo joined the Naval Training Unit at Harvard University. The war ended before he went into active service. ==Business career== After graduating from high school in 1917, Rugo went into business with his father. In 1929 he began the Rugo Construction Co. with his brothers. The Rugos were involved in many projects in the Boston area, including the construction of schools for the City of Boston and the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Boston. In 1939, Rugo was elected president of the Associated General Contractors of Massachusetts. During World War II, the company built the Letterkenny Ordnance Depot in Chambersburg, Pennsylvania in a joint venture with the Perini Corporation. In 1945, Rugo's brother Joseph left the firm. Upon his departure he demanded an accounting of an investment fund he and his two brothers owned. Rugo refused and in 1948, Joseph sued him. In 1950, Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court ordered Rugo to pay his brother $140,418 for his share in the fund. In 1952, Rugo's other brother, Leonard, sued him for an accounting of a $1 million slush fund used to make payoffs to public officials in Boston, Chicopee, Massachusetts, and other communities in connection with building contracts. Rugo testified to making payoffs between 1929 and 1943, but refused to name who received them. Boston City Auditor Charles J. Fox cleared Rugo of wrongdoing and ordered that the Boston School Committee pay Rugo the balance owed on the construction of a school. ==Boston Braves== In 1941, Rugo was a member of a syndicate led by Bob Quinn that purchased controlling interest in the Boston Braves (then known as the Bees) from Charles Adams. Rugo was a close friend of Quinn's son, John Quinn. In the fall of 1943, Rugo and two other minority partners, Louis Perini and C. Joseph Maney, issued an ultimatum to the other members of the syndicate - to buy out the trio's stock for what they paid for it or allow the three to purchase the other partners' stock for what they paid for it. The other stockholders elected to sell and on January 21, 1944, Perini, Maney, and Rugo purchased the club outright. The three businessmen, who were all contractors, were known as the \\"Three Little Steam Shovels\\". In 1948, the Braves won the National League pennant, but lost the World Series to the Cleveland Indians. In 1951, Rugo sold his interest in the club to Perini and Maney. ==Personal life== A resident of Milton, Massachusetts, Rugo moved to Marblehead, Massachusetts in 1949 after he purchased \\"Carcassonne\\", the home of Lydia Pinkham Gove (granddaughter of Lydia Pinkham), for $50,000. In 1964 Rugo sold \\"Carcassonne\\" to attorney Robert DiGiacomo and returned to Boston. On January 30, 1960, Rugo collapsed at a meeting of the Clover Club in Boston, where he was a guest of former Braves publicity director Billy Sullivan. Rugo had suffered a similar episode ten days earlier at his office. ==Death== Rugo died on November 18, 1984 at his home in West Roxbury.

It was nominated for being one of Minnesota's oldest and best preserved Italian Villa style houses. ==History== Early Winona settlers Henry and Harriet Huff had this opulent brick house built for themselves in 1857, when the city's environment consisted mostly of rough lumber buildings and dirt roads. Within a few years, the Huffs, having made a sufficient fortune, moved to Chicago and sold the house to Henry Lamberton. He added the Moorish Revival porch in 1873 during the height of the late-19th-century Orientalism fad. The house stayed in the Lamberton family until 1956, when the last heir died. During the 1960s it was converted to an orphanage. Sauer Memorial Homes purchased the house in 1982 and operated it as an assisted living facility for the next 24 years. In 2006 they determined that they couldn't afford upgrades to make the house more handicap-accessible, and put it up for sale.

The film was released by Crown International Pictures on June 2, 1971. ==Plot== Spunky and precocious high school senior Mindy Evans spurns her decent, but frustrated boyfriend Bill and has a fling with teacher Jack Thompson, a hunky nice guy that's married. Mindy finds out that she might be pregnant. While waiting for the results of her pregnancy test, Mindy decides to alleviate the tension by embarking on an impromptu road trip to Big Sur, California with her best girl friend Sandy. Although a dated and corny for modern audiences, the film remains as a nice period piece that reflects the very early 1970s youth culture. Despite a little bit of nudity, the film is surprisingly non-exploitative and non- judgmental about its subject matter. ==Cast== *Patricia Wymer as Mindy Evans *Steven Stewart as Jack Thompson *Gary Rist as Bill *Bruno Kirby as Les *Jennifer Ritt as Gretchen Thompson *Dennis Christopher as Pan *Marly Holiday as Sandy *Anthony Mannino *Robert Almanza as Danny *Joe Pepe as Lieutenant *Max Manning as Bartender *Frances Tremaine as Teacher *Tom Benko as Reporter *Pat Russell as And Spare Change ==References * Category:1970s coming-of-age drama films Category:1971 drama films Category:1970s drama road movies Category:1971 films Category:American coming- of-age drama films Category:American drama road movies Category:American films Category:Crown International Pictures films Category:English-language films Category:Films set in California Category:Juvenile sexuality in films ","title":"The Young Graduates"},{"id":"56067574","text":"This is a list of episodes of the fifth season of The Ellen DeGeneres Show, which aired from September 2007 to June 2008. {  - !

Between 1956 and 1959 he worked as a consultant for the National Economic Council of the Latvian SSR. From 1960 to 1967 he studied theology at the seminary of the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Latvia in Riga. On 8 June 1969 he was ordained a priest in Holy Trinity Lutheran Church, Riga, to which he had been a vicar since 1968. From 1969 to 1986 he was pastor of Holy Trinity Church and from 1972 to 1986 also of the parish of Dalbe. From 1980 he was a member of the Consistory of the Latvian Church. Mesters was elected archbishop of Riga on 15 April 1986 during the extraordinary synod of the Latvian Evangelical Lutheran Church. He thus succeeded JƒÅnis Matulis, who died in August 1985. On 24 August he was consecrated by Olof Sundby Archbishop emeritus of Uppsala in St. Gertrude New Church, Riga.

During a clear night of observations, about 20 to 30 objects are observed. Because infrared light penetrates farther through gas and dust than visible light, this search will extend to stars thousands of light-years away. The initial target sample is mostly main-sequence and giant stars located within 50 parsecs from Earth, drawn from the Breakthrough Listen program target list.Breakthrough Listen - Stellar Targets: All Sky.

The sample of targets also includes 82 galaxies for being the nearest representatives of the five major morphological classes of galaxies (20 spirals, 36 ellipticals, 15 dwarf spheroidals, 9 irregulars, and 2 lenticular galaxies), as well as stars that triggered alarms on other targeted SETI surveys. A significant drawback is that the extraterrestrial laser signals would need to be transmitted in the direction of the Solar System in order to be detected. ==See also== * Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing (BOINC) * SETI@home ==References * Center for Astrophysics Space Science Optical and Infrared Laboratory Category:Search for extraterrestrial intelligence Category:Interstellar messages Category:University of California, Berkeley Category:Astrobiology ","title":"NIROSETI"},{"id":"56067660","text":"Robert Nagel (September 29, 1924 ‚Äì June 5, 2016) was an American trumpet player, composer, and teacher.

After the disaster of the Battle of Bia≈Çystok‚ÄìMinsk, Klimovskikh, along with General Pavlov and the entire Front Staff, with the sole exception of Operations Officer Ivan Boldin, were recalled to Moscow, charged with military incompetence and executed later that July. == Early life and World War I == Klimovskikh was born on 27 May 1895 in Kokand, the son of an office clerk. After his 1912 graduation from a Realschule in Tashkent, Klimovskikh entered the Alexeyev Military School of the Imperial Russian Army in Moscow, from which he graduated in 1914. He was assigned to the 11th Siberian Rifle Regiment of the 3rd Siberian Rifle Division, with which he served until its disbandment in February 1918. Klimovskikh fought with the regiment in World War I on the Northern Front, serving in positions below battalion commander. Following the February Revolution, he was elected a member of the regimental committee, and a battalion commander. Klimovskikh ended his service in the Imperial Army with the rank of Captain; in early 1918 he and his regiment fought against the troops of the Ukrainian Central Rada near Kiev. == Russian Civil War == Klimovskikh joined the Red Army in June 1918 and was enrolled in the junior course of the General Staff Academy. He was unable to study due to the evacuation of the Academy to Kazan and the defection of its command and part of the student body to the White movement. Klimovskikh fought in the Russian Civil War, serving as assistant chief of staff of the 5th Army on the Eastern Front from August 1918. He subsequently served as the head of the operations department on the staff of the 3rd Army and was acting chief of staff of the 27th Rifle Division between March and April 1919. Klimovskikh was transferred to the Western Front after the White defeat in the east and fought in the Polish‚ÄìSoviet War as head of the operations department on the staff of the 16th Army, chief of staff of the 57th Rifle Division during April and May 1920, and as chief of staff of the Mozyr Group of Forces. == Interwar period and World War II == After the Civil War, he was the Chief of Staff of the infantry corps, the head of the department, an assistant to the chief of the headquarters of the military districts. From December 1932 to June 1936, he was on the teaching staff at the Frunze Military Academy. In 1935, he was awarded the rank of brigade commander. From July 1936 he served as assistant army inspector and then, in February 1938, was senior lecturer at the Military Academy of the General Staff. In September 1939 he was appointed Deputy Chief of Staff and then from July 1940 served as Chief of Staff of the Western Special Military District. With the outbreak of war on the Eastern Front, he was made Chief of Staff of the Western Front under Army General Dmitry Pavlov.

She served as hovm√§starinna to queen Catherine Stenbock of Sweden, and then to the daughter and sisters of Eric XIV of Sweden. ==Life== Anna Hogenskild was the daughter of the nobleman Klemet Bengtsson Hogenskild of √Öker√∂ (d. 1512) and lady Anna Hansdotter Thott of Bjurum (d. 1549). She belonged to a prominent noble family: her mother was the maternal granddaughter of princess Christina (ca 1432- before 1500), eldest daughter of Charles VIII of Sweden, and related to Sten Sture the Elder. She married nobleman Jacob Krumme (d. 1531) in 1530, and nobleman Nils Pedersson Bielke (d. 1550) in 1537. In her second married she became the mother of three sons and a daughter: riksr√•d baron Hogenskild Bielke (1538-1605), Carin Nilsdotter Bielke (1539-1596), riksr√•d baron Claes Nilsson Bielke (1544-1623) of Vik, and riksr√•d Ture Nilsson Bielke (1548-1600). ===Court career=== She had good connections at court, where her family was in service. Her second spouse was a court official and a trusted confidant of king Gustav I of Sweden, her eldest son Hogenskild Bielke became the playmate of prince Magnus, Duke of √ñsterg√∂tland and later (1556) courtier of king Gustav; and her second son Claes married Elsa Fleming, the sister of queen Gunilla Bielke. Anna Hogenskild herself was eventually appointed hovm√§starinna (Chief lady-in- waiting or Mistress of the Robes) to king Gustav's last queen, Catherine Stenbock. As such, she was made responsible for all the ladies-in-waiting in the household of the queen. Anna Hogenskild had been highly regarded by King Eric XIV already when he was a crown prince, and during his reign, he displayed his favor upon her and her children. After he succeeded to the throne in 1560, he had no queen, but he gave her the office of hovm√§starinna in the household of the princesses, his sisters: Princess Cecilia, Anna, Sophia and Elizabeth of Sweden. She was also given the responsibility for the household of his illegitimate daughters Virginia Eriksdotter and Constantia Eriksdotter. As Mistress of the Household of the Princesses, she was known to have used her position to benefit her family: in 1563, eight of the thirteen maids-of-honour to the princesses where related to her.Caroline zum Kolk, \\"Nadine Akkerman, Birgit Houben (√©d.) : The Politics of Female Households. Ladies in Waiting across Early Modern Europe\\", Paris, Cour de France.fr, 2014 (http://cour-de-france.fr/article2346.html). Compte rendu publi√© le 1er novembre 2014. She was, however, apparently both well liked and respected at court, and was not known to be too strict: in fact, king Eric appointed her brother-in-law Ture Pedersson as chamberlain in the household of the princesses because he did not trust Anna Hogenskild to be able to keep his sisters sufficiently under control.Ellen Fries, M√§rkv√§rdiga qvinnor Anna left court service after the deposition of Eric XIV in 1568. King John III of Sweden suggested that the deposed king Eric was to be imprisoned in Vik Castle, one of the estates of Anna, but the negotiations did not succeed and the plan was not put to fruition. ===Private life=== Privately, she was a central matriarch in the powerful Bielke family, and her relationship to her relatives was described as warm and trusting rather than forceful and dominant. Judging by her accounts, she gave generous donations to the needing, but also to the Vadstena Abbey and the N√•dendal Abbey, suggesting Catholic sympathies, which was not uncommon among the contemporary Swedish aristocracy despite the ongoing Swedish Reformation.Nils Pedersson (Bielke), urn:sbl:18171, Svenskt biografiskt lexikon (art av B. Bo√´thius.), h√§mtad 2017-12-16. It is known that several of her family members had Catholic sympathies: two of her sons, Ture Nilsson Bielke and Hogenskild Bielke, where to be executed by Charles XI of Sweden as loyalists with the Catholic Sigismund III Wasa, and her granddaughter Ebba Bielke judged for complicity though not executed. Anna Hogenskild was one of the greatest landowners in contemporary Sweden. Her second spouse was a big landholder, owning estates both in Sweden and Denmark, and Anna herself inherited √Öker√∂ Manor in 1540, where she preferred to reside. Due to the court service of her spouse, it was in effect she who managed the family estates for him, and after his death in 1550, she became a landowner also formally. Despite having to combine her own court service in parallel with the estates, she managed her lands with \\"much care, strength and success\\".Nils Pedersson (Bielke), urn:sbl:18171, Svenskt biografiskt lexikon (art av B. Bo√´thius.), h√§mtad 2017-12-16.

In January 1945, Nanette was transferred to a part of Bergen-Belsen known as the small women‚Äôs camp. From there, she saw Anne Frank in the large women‚Äôs camp through the barbed wired fence. These two camps become one section and it was then that Nanette was reunited with Anne and her sister Margot.‚ÄúO Estado de S√£o Paulo - Mem√≥rias de adolesc√™ncia‚Äù, 24 July 2011 by Monica Manis and Carol Pires :I was all alone in the camp, so being reunited with someone I knew was something that made me unforgettably emotional, because love and friendship were our only means of hope amid chaos. One day, as I was walking outside the barrack area, I got closer to the barbed-wire fence that prevented me from having access to other parts of the camp. On the other side of the fence, I saw a face that looked familiar. It was Anne Frank! Anne looked as frail as I did. I still had my hair, but hers had been shaved. I only caught a glimpse of her, since we were in different camps and I could not get any closer. However, that was enough to motivate me, to want to see her and talk to her. We would certainly have a lot to share. --From: Holocaust Memoirs of a Bergen-Belsen Survivor - Classmate of Anne Frank by Nanette Blitz Konig Nanette survived Bergen-Belsen and was rescued by the British Major Leonard Berney. After the war, she spent three years in hospital due to typhus, the disease which killed Margot and Anne Frank. During this period, Anne's father visited her to ask about his daughters. Later, Otto Frank gave Nanette the diary written by his daughter Anne, Het Achterhuis (The Secret Annex). After Nanette had recovered, she went to live in England where she met her husband, John Konig who was of Hungarian origin. In 1953, they married and moved to Brazil. Nanette gave lectures about the Holocaust and her life. In 2018 Holocaust Memoirs of a Bergen-Belsen Survivor - Classmate of Anne Frank by Nanette Blitz Konig was published by Amsterdam Publishers: it gave a detailed account of her experiences during World War II. The book won the Readers' Favorite Gold Medal Award in 2019. ==References== Category:1929 births Category:Living people Category:Bergen- Belsen concentration camp survivors Category:Women in World War II Category:Dutch children Category:Holocaust survivors Category:Dutch emigrants to Brazil Category:People from Amsterdam Category:Anne Frank Category:Dutch Jews Category:Brazilian Jews ","title":"Nanette Blitz Konig"},{"id":"56067782","text":"The 1975‚Äì76 Anglo-Scottish Cup was the first edition of the tournament which replaced the Texaco Cup.

In this genre the lyrics are improvised by two competing performers;by two or more participants taking turns, based on impromptu or made-up stanzas; or by a solo performer who improvises on a topic requested by his audience. But the cifra is mainly the song of the \\"payadores\\" (singers from Argentinian Pampa) who improvise in opposition. The way in which this interrupted song is combined and linked to the strumming of the guitar is the most characteristic of it and, a characteristic unique among American songbooks. In fact, the song dialogues with the guitar. A series of strummed chords serves as a prelude. When the singer raises his voice, the guitar goes silent. Once one or two verses are finished, the strumming or some grave note punctuated by a brief interlude breaks again, and thus, the verse runs to the end. No having measure for interludes or account for repetitions of verses, the form is more or less free. In the best times of the genre, it was used as a confrontation between two singers to change sharp questions or answers in strophe. While strumming the initial prelude, the payador thinks about his first question and, launched to sing the verses, interrupts and interludes as much as he needs to continue thinking about the idea or the versification; keep it up until it complete the thought and stanza. At that moment his opponent choose the verse of the question and initiates his response in the same way. An improviser is all the more skilled the less the number of repetitions and interludes required to be versed. == References  External links == * About the Cifra, by Lauro Ayestar√°n Category:Argentine styles of music Category:Argentine music Category:Uruguayan music Category:Argentine culture Category:Uruguayan culture ","title":"Cifra (musical genre)"},{"id":"56067806","text":"Neon Chrome is a twin-stick shooter video game developed by 10tons. ==Gameplay== Neon Chrome is a cyberpunk-themed twin-stick shooter video game played from a top-down perspective.

Built as part of the ePUAP- WKP project (State Informatization Plan). Service providers are public administration units and public institutions (especially entities that perform tasks commissioned by the state). The platform provides service providers with technological infrastructure to provide services to citizens (recipients). Among the participants of ePUAP there are both central administration units and local governments, including municipal offices. Among the services offered by ePUAP is also Profil Zaufany (Trusted Profile), which enables electronic filing with legal effect without the need to use a qualified signature and SAML-based single sign-on mechanism, which enables the same ePUAP account to log on to websites of various service providers. The website www.epuap.gov.pl enables defining citizen and businesses service processes, creates channels of access to different systems of public administration and extends the package of public services provided electronically. Services available through the ePUAP platform may be accessed at the official website. Currently all administration services are available in Polish only. == Overview == It is described by the Polish government as \\"a coherent and systematic action program designed and developed to allow public institutions make their electronic services available to the public\\". The platform provides citizens, businesses and institutions with a number of services intended to ensure smooth and safe communication between: * customer to administrations (C2A), * business to administration (B2A), * administration to administration (A2A). === Main goals === The main project objectives are to create a single, secure and electronic access channel to public services for citizens, businesses and public administration and also to reduce time and lower the costs of sharing information resources and functionalities of administration domain systems. Within the project, the following functionalities and services were delivered: * Public services catalogue ‚Äì a method of presenting and describing administration services, * ePUAP platform ‚Äì a web platform designed to provide public services on the Internet, * Interoperability portal ‚Äì a portal for experts working on recommendations for electronic documents and forms used within Polish administration systems to assure the uniformity of IT standards, * Central Repository of Electronic Document Models ‚Äì a database for valid document models and electronic forms. == History and background == The ePUAP project was carried out in the years 2005-2008. Currently a continuation project ePUAP2 is being carried out with the following objectives: * to increase the number of online services available to the public including the registry services, * to widen the scale of usage of public electronic services, * to integrate subsequent systems of public administration and business on ePUAP portal, * to define new processes of customer and business services. === ePUAP2 === ePUAP2 is a public and administrative project that extends the set of functional services developed during the first edition of the project and is another step in the process of transforming Poland into a modern and citizen-friendly country. The implementation period for the project covers the years 2009-2013. Project financing The cost of the project ‚ÄúConstruction of electronic Platform of Public Administration Services‚Äù ‚Äì 32 million PLN was covered in 75% by the funds from the European Regional Development Fund (under the Sector Operational Programme \\"Supporting Competitiveness of Enterprises for the years 2004-2006\\"), while the remaining 25% of the cost was covered by a Polish national co-financing. Funds for the ePUAP2 project were gained from the 7th priority axis of the Innovative Economy Operational Programme and amounts to 140 million PLN (85% of eligible expenses were covered by the European Regional Development Fund, 15% were covered by a national co-financing). The trustee of ePUAP is the Polish Ministry of the Interior and Administration. == Legal regulations == According to the Polish law from 1 May 2008, public authorities are required to accept documents in electronic form (bringing applications and proposals and other activities in electronic form). ePUAP enables public institutions to meet this requirement by providing a service infrastructure to set up am electronic inbox. The ePUAP inbox meets legal requirements, in particular: * issuing an official confirmation of receipt in accordance with the regulation of the Prime Minister of 29 September 2005 on the organizational and technical conditions for the delivery of electronic documents to public entities; * cooperation with hardware security modules (HSM), meeting the technical requirements set out in the law; * handling documents electronically in accordance with the minimum requirements set out in the Regulation of the Polish Council of Ministers of October 11, 2005 on minimum requirements for ICT systems. == Incidents  Crashes === The ePUAP system very often happens smaller or larger failures. Because it is used to sign the application profiles trusted also in other electronic systems such as public administration. Electronic Services Platform created by ZUS, the system fault ePUAP it very difficult to settle official matters most electronically. === \\"Infoafera\\" === According to TVN and the release of TVP News from 10 April 2014, the creation of ePUAP is also associated with the so-called \\"Infoafera.\\" On April 10, 2014, the Minister of Internal Affairs of Poland confirmed the information that the American technology company HP confessed to its participation in the Polish info-tour and corruption of Polish officials.

The King's Theatre Melbourne detail from theatre programme State Library Victoria Opening in 1908, the theatre was designed by William Pitt for the theatrical entrepreneur William Anderson. It was a major live theatre during the first half of the twentieth century, and became a cinema (under the name the Barclay) from the late 1950s until closing in 1976. ==Design and construction== The theatre's designer, William Pitt, had already designed a number of Melbourne theatres including the Princess Theatre and Her Majesty's Theatre before working on designs for the Kings Theatre. William Anderson selected a site (now 131 Russell Street) on Russell Street, near the corner of Bourke Street for the new theatre and construction, employing 200 men, construction took only 5-6 months, beginning after Christmas in 1907. The building featured the use of 2,000,000 bricks, cost 32,000 pounds to construct and included 15 theatre exits that led into streets or laneways in consideration of fire risk. At opening there were 3000 lights in the theatre, and it could seat 2200 people. The theatre also had three sliding roofs, over dome, gallery and stage. At opening, the theatre's colour scheme was blue and gold, with upholstery and seats in blue. The stage was 63 feet wide by 80 feet deep to allow for large productions and complex scenery/props. ==Opening and early years== The King's Theatre, said to be the first new theatre in Melbourne for 20 years, was opened on Saturday 11 July 1908. Victorian State Premier Sir Thomas Bent opened the theatre and other members of parliament were in attendance at the opening performance of Man to Man, a drama which featured Anderson's wife Eugenie Duggan in a leading role, as well as her brother Edmund Duggan. In the early years, the theatre presented a number of productions by the theatrical company of William Anderson, sole lessee and manager of the theatre. Many of these productions featured Anderson's wife Eugenie Duggan in a leading role. Her brother Edmund Duggan, Olive Wilton and Roy Redgrave also acted in a number of these productions. Other companies such as J.C. Williamson's also put on productions at the theatre. As well as melodramas and plays, the theatre also presented shows by other acts, such as controversial Canadian dancer Maud Allan, with musicians the Cherniavskys (Mischel, Leo and Jan) and international magicians Le Roy, Talma & Bosco, an act which featured Servais Le Roy, his wife Talma and their colleague Leon Bosco. The theatre had been built to allow for lavish productions in which \\"live cattle or traps, motor cars etc. may be necessary for the purposes of realism\\" and the production of the sporting play The Chance of a Lifetime featured Trixy, a trained mare and carriages onstage, while sheep were shorn onstage during the production The Squatter's Daughter. In 1911 Anderson faced financial ruin due to the failure of his Wonderland City fun fair venture in Sydney. He remained the lessee of Kings Theatre in name only until 1915, but in reality handed over the theatre to the use of Edmund Duggan and Bert Bailey in 1912. ==Later live theatre years== Margaret Nybloc in Daddies at King's Theatre Melbourne (1919) Theatre Programmes Collection, State Library Victoria (Australia) From 1915 the theatre's lessees were Bert Bailey and Anderson's former business manager, Julius Grant. This period saw a number of productions by J. and N. Tait Ltd, the firm of three of the Tait brothers, John Henry, James Nevin and Frank Samuel, who merged their enterprise with that of J.C. Williamson's in 1920. During the 1920, '30s and '40s, the theatre saw plays, vaudeville, pantomimes (such as Sinbad the Sailor (1939)), comedians, musical revues (like the mostly American production of Olsen and Johnson's Hellzapoppin (1949)), magicians and others perform. In March 1922 the American illusionist Nicola (William Mozart Nicol), who was also giving shows inside the theatre, performed a trick where he hung upside down from a sign that was suspended from the roof of the theatre. He then proceeded to free himself from a strait jacket and handcuffs while in midair. The trick, which was publicised by saying that Nicola would be hanged from the King's Theatre, was in contravention of council by-laws due to the use of 'a lift and tackle' in Russell Street and saw Nicola charged and appear in the district court where he was fined. ==Film screenings and return to live performances== 1942 saw the temporary end to live performances when film projection equipment was installed by Garnet H. Carroll and Benjamin Fuller's Gaiety Theatres company, who leased the theatre. Warner Brothers screened films at the theatre until 1948. The following year, Carroll, with partners Aztec Services had the theatre reconverted for live stage productions for sub-lessee, entrepreneur Harry Wren. 1949 saw the Kings Theatre host a season of the controversial Australian play Rusty Bugles, a drama about servicemen by Sumner Locke Elliott, which featured a large degree of swearing. However a full return to live productions was short lived and in 1951 films were screened there again, as well as stage presentations. ==Barclay Cinema and demolition== The interior of the King's Theatre, as well as the facade were remodelled for then owner Norman B. Rydge. The theatre was then renamed the Barclay Theatre or Barclay Cinema. The theatre officially opened in 1958 and the first film shown was Cecil B. DeMille's The Ten Commandments. The last film shown was One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest in 1975 and finally in 1977 the theatre was demolished to give way to a multiplex cinema, Greater Union Russell Cinemas, which itself was later demolished in 2014. ==Productions== Russell Street, Melbourne, showing King's Theatre on right.

She was the abbess of N√•dendal Abbey in 1526‚Äì1531. ==Biography== She was born before 1494 as the daughter of the riksr√•d nobleman Joakim Fleming and Elin Bj√∂rnsdotter of Svidja, and the sister of riksr√•d admiral Erik Joakimsson Fleming and Ivar Fleming, two of the most powerful men in Finland, and aunt of Filippa Fleming. She was placed in N√•dendal Abbey as a nun by her family, and was promoted abbess in 1526. This was one year before the Swedish Reformation. During the reformation, the convent was placed under pressure. The reformation allowed for the donors, or the families of former donors, to retract all donations made to convents, which placed all convents at financial risk: additionally, the convents were banned from accepting new members, and the existing were allowed to leave if they wished. These were problems Valborg had to attend during her tenure. Despite being the sister of the most powerful men in Finland, Valborg did not benefit in her struggle to protect the convent. Instead, her brothers took advantage of her difficult position, and they forced her to sign over a great amount of the convent's assets in exchange for their support and financial help. Valborg instead appealed directly to Gustav I of Sweden, and successfully asked for the convent to keep the property it owned upon its foundation from confiscation: she was in fact also granted two estates more for the abbey's upkeep (1530). This saved the convent financially (if temporarily) and made it possible to support their members. In 1534, Valborg left the convent and settled with her brother Erik on his estate Svidja in Sjunde√• parish. ==See also== * Katarina Gylta ==References== * Biografiskt lexikon f√∂r Finland 1.

It was constructed in 1935 by Lydia Pinkham Gove, granddaughter of Lydia Pinkham. During the 1970s and 80s it was owned by George A. Butler, who held glitzy parties in the three-story, 23-room granite castle. ==Construction== Construction on Carcassonne took place during The Great Depression. Granite was hauled from the South Shore, wood was imported from Australia, Mexico, Venezuela, and Africa, and marble was brought in from around the world. The cost of construction was $500,000 and Gove received a commendation from President Franklin Delano Roosevelt for putting many unemployed craftsmen to work. Carcassonne was built by Gourdeau Construction Co. of Hamilton, Massachusetts. ==Layout== Carcassonne has a tri-level symmetrical floor plan designed around a central circular tower. It has 23 rooms and 11 baths, almost all of them have an ocean view. It includes seven fireplaces and a salt-water pool. It is located on 2.5 acres, which includes 307 feet of ocean beachfront. ==OwnersGuido Rugo=== On August 15, 1949, Guido Rugo purchased Carcassonne from Gove's estate for $50,000. In 1954, the Rugos hosted 500 guests for Archbishop Richard J. Cushing's 59th birthday. In 1964, the Rugos sold the house to attorney Robert J. DiGiacomo and his wife who sold it in 1966 to James Zografos, who sold it to Butler in 1973. ===George A. Butler=== In 1972, George A. Butler, the New England distributor of Toyota automobiles, purchased Carcassonne. He decorated the castle with a number of unique objects, including a jewelry case made out of an ostrich egg, an impala skeleton, and a painting of Muhammad Ali inscribed by the boxer. Butler also had a private helipad, a small theater, and four tiers of gardens. Butler hosted a number of benefit parties at Carcassonne for the Boston Children's Hospital and his other favorite charities. Carcassonne's annual benefit for the Boys & Girls Clubs of Boston, known as \\"Pique-Nique au Bord de Mer\\" (picnic by the sea), drew a number of famous guests, including Joan Kennedy, John Havlicek, Mike Eruzione, Francis X. Bellotti, Frank Avruch, Tom Ellis, Don Gillis, and Thomas P. O'Neill III. Peter Duchin performed at the 1980 event. He also hosted fundraisers for the Massachusetts Democratic Party. Butler sold Carcassonne in 1982. He stated that he decided to sell the home because its dampness aggregated his asthma and its small windows inhibited his view of the ocean. Butler and his wife moved into smaller home three doors down from Carcassonne. ===Later ownership=== Condominium developer William Lilly purchased Carcassonne from Butler for $1 million. In 1991, the property was foreclosed on by 1st American Bank for Savings. It was sold by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation at a sealed-bid auction. The minimum bid was $1.53 million. At the time, Carcassonne was assessed at $3.4 million. In 1992, Carcassonne's new owners, the Gianatasio family, gave the mansion an extensive makeover. ==References== Category:Castles in Massachusetts Category:Houses completed in 1935 Category:Houses in Marblehead, Massachusetts ","title":"Carcassonne Castle"},{"id":"56068825","text":"The Monroe C.

The murders, which were never solved, aroused a great deal of public interest, and due to similarities between them, they are widely speculated to have been the work of a serial killer or Soviet intelligence. ==The murders== Between November 1962 and July 1963, three murders took place in central Israel. The victims were not connected, but each case showed similar parallels. In each murder, the killer, who had no apparent motive, gunned down the victims with an Uzi submachine gun, then immediately fled the scene and was not caught. ===Moshe Stolero=== The murder scene of Moshe Stolero The first victim was Moshe Stolero, a 32 year old disabled man, who owned a household goods, book, and newspaper store in Ramat Gan, and lived with his parents in an apartment on Hachayal Street, in the same building where his store was located. On November 15, 1962, at around 7:00 PM, after Stolero had closed and locked up his shop and was returning home, a gunman fired at him with an Uzi as he was in the stairwell of the building. Stolero was hit three times and killed. The fact that the murder was not committed as part of a robbery attempt and nothing was stolen from his store led police to conclude that the murderer's sole intention was to kill Stolero. ===Shmuel Yachman=== The second victim was Dr. Shmuel Yachman, an internal physician in Tel Aviv who provided medical services to the US Embassy in Israel. Yachman, who was born in Germany as Siegfried Yachman, lived at 12 Mazeh Street. He was murdered on the night of April 2, 1963. Yachman and his wife Sarah were returning home from a concert, when at the entrance to their home, he was killed by a single shot to the neck from an Uzi. The killer immediately fled without leaving a trace. ===Deborah Chachkes=== The third victim was Deborah Chachkes, who lived with her family in a small house near an orchard on the outskirts of Kfar Saba. In the early morning hours of July 17, 1963, a man entered their home and fired several shots from an Uzi at Deborah and her husband Fishel as they slept. Deborah was killed and Fishel was seriously injured. The murderer again escaped. ==Public reaction== The fact that three mysterious murders had taken place within nine months, all without apparent motive, carried out with the same type of weapon, and in which the murderer managed to escape without leaving a trace, caused panic among the public as the media struggled to find an explanation. Due to the fact that Deborah Chechkes had visited the Soviet Union to see her sick mother two years before, and that Dr. Yachman provided services to the US Embassy, conspiracy theories about the involvement of Soviet intelligence were proposed. ===Levy Neufeld affair=== At around the same time, a 19-year-old medical student at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem named Levy Neufeld left his home and disappeared without a trace. Neufeld had survived the Holocaust as a toddler together with his brother Yehuda, and the two brothers had been adopted by a couple from Ramat Gan. Neufeld was an outstanding student, but as his final exams approached, he began to suffer from mental problems prior to his disappearance. After he had been gone for two weeks, his family reported him missing to police. Police then decided that there was a high probability that Neufeld committed the murders. A nationwide manhunt was launched in which over 1,000 police officers were involved. He was presented to the public as a dangerous person, and it was speculated that psychological damage brought on by the trauma of the Holocaust had driven him to kill. The press accused him of the murders, which led to the poetess Zelda sending a letter of protest to Haaretz, accusing the press of baselessly accusing him without trial and comparing the media frenzy to a lynch mob. On May 3, 1964, Neufeld was found dead by a group of youths in an abandoned building in the Ein Kerem neighborhood of Jerusalem. A suicide note and bottle of poison were found next to his body. A pathological examination of his body found that the time of his death preceded two of the three murders. ==Allegations Soviet involvement== It was speculated at the time that the murders may have been linked to Soviet involvement due to Chachkes' previous visit to the Soviet Union and Yachman's services to the US Embassy, although no explanation for why the Soviets would have wanted to kill Stolero was offered. In October 2012, Avraham Chachkes, the son of Deborah Chachkes, was interviewed by the Israeli newspaper Yediot Ahronoth, and claimed that his father Fishel had been active in organizing the escape of Soviet Jews who wanted to leave the country, and continued working for Israeli intelligence after his arrival in Israel. He speculated that his mother had been followed after her visit to the Soviet Union, and claimed that his father was the killer's actual target. Avraham claimed to have spoken with Israeli Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion himself over the matter, and said that Ben-Gurion had told him the killer was a Soviet agent who had since left the country. Isser Harel, the former Director-General of the Mossad, denied the killer was a Soviet spy. ==References== Category:1962 crimes in Israel Category:1963 crimes in Israel Category:1960s murders in Israel Category:1962 murders in Asia Category:1963 murders in Asia Category:Crime in Israel Category:Israeli serial killers Category:Murder in Israel Category:Unidentified serial killers ","title":"Stolero-Yachman-Chachkes affair"},{"id":"56068973","text":"Huckleberry Mountain is a summit located in Adirondack Mountains of New York located in the Town of Hope north-northwest of the hamlet of Hope Falls. ==References== Category:Mountains of Hamilton County, New York Category:Mountains of New York (state) ","title":"Huckleberry Mountain"},{"id":"56068989","text":"The following is a list of the top 10 films chosen annually by the critics of Cahiers du Cin√©ma, a French film magazine.

The film stars Forest Whitaker, Anthony LaPaglia, Rosie Perez, Jennifer Grey, Tony Todd and Saundra McClain. The film premiered on HBO on September 8, 1990. == Plot == A young prostitute is robbed in the vestibule of a building after having bought drugs and in the encounter suffers a deep and disfiguring slash to her face. The detectives called to the crime scene, take the injured victim to the police station where she is handed photographs of some felons on their records. She identifies the perpetrator of the crime in the photograph. The police arrest the suspect and after the victim again identifies her assailant in the police line-up, the perpetrator is charged with aggravated robbery. At the arraignment, his bail is set at an unaffordable amount. Despite having to remain in custody, he denies any wrongdoing to his keen legal-aid lawyer. On account of his repeated claims of innocence, he refuses to accept any plea-bargain deal, no matter how favourable. On the other hand, the District Attorney, battles to make the best of the victim/complainant‚Äôs case which, despite her positive identification of the accused, is based only on her sole evidence. Coupled with this, the District attorney has reason to believe she might not have been truthful about her reason for being in the building where she was assaulted and robbed in the first place. The complainant is apprehensive about the legal system but certain that the accused was her assailant. Bail is refused for the accused and several court appearances take place while he awaits trial. The complainant, who suffers the effects of a drug lifestyle is outraged at the refusal of the accused to plead guilty, and, becomes increasingly unwilling to testify. The trial date is set and, to the relief of the District Attorney on the day, the complainant enters the courtroom to commence her testimony. Upon seeing her enter the courtroom, the accused volubly instructs his lawyer to make a plea-bargain deal so that the trial is stopped. For pleading guilty to both the robbery and slashing of the complainant, he is sentenced to years in the penitentiary. From their divergent perspectives both the complainant and the mother of the accused feel dissatisfied about the outcome of the case. ==Cast== *Forest Whitaker as Jessie Williams *Anthony LaPaglia as David Ringel *Rosie Perez as Denise Moore *Jennifer Grey as Liz Carter *Tony Todd as Detective Riley *Saundra McClain as Loretta Charles *Joe Lisi as Detective Lane *Stephen Pearlman as Judge Ratner *William Cameron as Mitchell *Chuck Cooper as Judge Whitney *Bill Dalzell as Ratner's Clerk *Charles Sanders as A.D.A.

The attack was aimed at capturing 13 tons of weaponry: 900 FN FAL rifles with 60,000 magazines, 100 M16 rifles with 100,000 magazines, six 20 mm anti- aircraft cannons, fifteen recoilless guns, 150 submachine guns and Ithaca M37 shotguns. The assault had been planned since August 1975, and the attackers gained access to the compound with the help of an infiltrated guerrilla posing as a soldier. == Background == Unbeknownst to the ERP, Rafael Jes√∫s de Ranier, a former member of the Peronist Armed Forces left-wing group who had defected during the early stages of Operativo Independencia and turned spy for the military, had been providing valuable intelligence data to the Army throughout 1975. The commander of the ERP's logistic section, Juan Eliseo Ledesma, was kidnapped on 7 December and was followed by his deputy El√≠as Abd√≥n on 11 December. Based on information extracted under torture from Abd√≥n, the military learned that a major attack was to take place somewhere in the Greater Buenos Aires, correctly calculating that, in dire need of weaponry, the ERP would target an arsenal depot, with Monte Chingolo being the most obvious option. Santucho, however, refused to cancel the operation and his forces, having lost the surprise factor, were promptly defeated by a well- prepared Argentine Army. == Assault == At 19:00, the Jos√© de San Mart√≠n Urban Battalion, reinforced by 30 to 40 Communist fighters newly arrived from Tucum√°n province, began the operation by blocking the nine bridges that connect the city of Buenos Aires proper with the its conurbation area. The Quilmes, Avellaneda and Lomas de Zamora police brigades came under ERP hostility, as did the 7th Infantry Regiment in La Plata and the 601st Communications Battalion at City Bell. Fierce fighting took place in a number of these spots, such as Pasco Avenue and La Noria bridge, where it was reported that around 30 ERP snipers fired upon the local police station. A poorly armed ERP squad crowded several cars on a bridge over the Matanza River and spilled diesel fuel from a tanker truck, setting it on fire. Elsewhere, 15 city buses were set on fire in order to stave off the arrival of Army reinforcements. At 19:15, a column of trucks and APCs from the 3rd Infantry Regiment managed to break through and drove towards Lan√∫s without finding any resistance. At 19:45, a force of 70 fighters under the command of Abigail Attademo (captain Miguel) entered the military base. Thirty-five of them formed an initial spearhead after crashing a truck against the main gate. Other guerrillas entered through other points of access. They were immediately mowed down by heavy fire coming from a FN MAG machine gun placed in the guard post, becoming the first casualties of the night. At 21:00, a second wave of fighters successfully broke into the compound. The military laid a counter- siege around the battalion, rendering the ERP's containment groups on the surrounding bridges useless and nullifying the surprise factor. The base and neighboring shantytown became a whirlwind of gunfire and explosions, with helicopter gunships using reflectors to illuminate the area. A reporter compared the fighting with that of the Vietnam War. The Army raided entire neighborhoods hunting for surviving ERP fighters. At 01:00 on 24 December, Urteaga lost contact with most of the Communist platoons still inside the Arsenal Battalion and fighting died out shortly afterwards. At 03:30, seven hours after the start of the assault and once it had already been repelled, a military scribe recorded that \\"Captain Lazzarano left with five vehicles to transport detainees under the custody of Lieutenant Silvani's fraction\\" and that they returned half an hour later. === Casualties and extrajudicial killings === The ERP lost over 90 of its fighters. Of the 62 that were killed in action, nine could not be identified due to them being only known by their nom de guerre. A number of them (30 according to Daniel De Santis) were taken prisoner and later summarily executed. At least 25 wounded were successfully evacuated by their comrades. On the other hand, between seven and ten soldiers and policemen were killed and 34 wounded. General Oscar Gallino acknowledged in 1991 that an undisclosed number of fighters were detained and handed over to Army intelligence units. == See also == * Operation Primicia * Dirty War == References == Monte Chingolo attack Monte Chingolo attack Category:Attacks on military installations Category:Lan√∫s ","title":"1975 Monte Chingolo attack"},{"id":"56069303","text":"Calo Scott (March 11, 1920 ‚Äî August 9, 1998) was a Cuban-American jazz cellist. Scott is noted for being one of earliest known jazz cellists. He established himself in the 1950s through working with the saxophonist Gerry Mulligan when ‚Äúhaving a cello player as an improvising member of a jazz group was then virtually unheard of.‚Äù In addition to Gerry Mulligan, Calo Scott worked with Ahmed Abdul-Malik, Gato Barbieri, Marc Levin, and John Handy among others. He was also active in New York City's Lower East Side intermedia-arts scene, working with artists such as dancer-choreographer Mary McKay, artist Aldo Tambellini, and filmmaker Cassandra Einstein (then known as Cassandra Gerstein). ==Early Life and career== Calo Scott was born in Camaguey, Cuba, and moved to the USA when he was two-years old. He began studies on piano, chose to focus his studies on the saxophone in his teens, and started working as a professional musician with a US Army band in the 1949. In the early 1950s he was diagnosed with a rheumatic heart condition and subsequently switched to cello. His peers and critics later commented that his early work with the saxophone heavily informed his signature phrasings on the cello. He studied at the Third Street Settlement House (a community school founded in 1894 in the Lower East Side, which offered classes in contemporary music and dance). He began working as a freelance musician in New York City in the mid 1950s, where he frequently performed at Five Spot, Dom, and Village Gate, as well as at Carnegie Hall. Between 1957-1974 he had participated in 23 recording sessions. His most acclaimed recordings include his solos in the track \\"Don't Blame Me\\" on The Music of Ahmed Abdul-Malik, and his contributions to Gato Barbieri Quartet's In Search Of The Mystery. Calo Scott was widely known for his unique habit of playing the cello while standing, which one can see in performance photos (such as those taken during Aldo Tambellini's \\"Black Zero\\"); Portraits of the artist suggest that he supported the cello‚Äôs weight with the assistance of wearing a saxophone-neck strap. Steve Lacy described Calo Scott in an interview as \\"A very good cellist. He was a great cellist and he used to pluck the cello [pizzicato] like a bass. He sounded like Jimmy Blanton really. It was amazing. He died young. This was the first guy I ever heard playing the cello like that. It was for dancing.\\" Lorenzo Thomas on Calo Scott ‚ÄúThe day John Handy III came to town, he was featured on television. But if you were down you had a chance to meet him at the Dom on St. Marks Place, the truly happening place those days on New York‚Äôs Lower East Side. Everyone was excited by the advance word; and, when it hit, the new LP from Columbia Records delivered a knockout punch. / It was Sunday afternoon and in the Dom‚Äôs cool, dark basement lounge Handy and cellist Calo Scott sat up on the bar and played some thoughtful, beautiful music. Intricate and soulful. These were artists with total mastery of their instruments‚Ä¶ They stopped just in time for everybody in the place, a couple dozen folk, to help John watch himself on TV. It was a family affair.‚Äù Norris Jones AKA Sirone on Calo Scott, during ESP recording: ‚ÄúCalo was an incredible cellist. I did not know this until later but I heard that he had played saxophone and had some health problems‚ÄîI don‚Äôt know how true it is‚Äîand this is why he switched over to cello. But the concept of the way he would go with cello, it was like he was playing a horn. His phrasing was completely taken in a different direction from the cello. [‚Ä¶] For two string players, we were very much accompanying one another. We were never in each other‚Äôs way. And when we made the individual contribution, the contribution was made towards the whole.‚Äù Calo Scott frequently collaborated with his partner, the dancer-choreographer Mary McKay. Additionally, he collaborated with the performance artist Aldo Tambellini: in two performances of Aldo Tambellini's performance ‚ÄúMoondial‚Äù in 1966 (at The Bridge Theater and at the University of Ontario, and in May 1967 (at the McCarter Theater). Calo Scott also performed independently with Aldo Tambellini to create sound for ‚ÄúBlack Zero‚Äù in 1968. Calo Scott also collaborated with the filmmaker Cassandra Gerstein: he provided the soundtrack for her film Kali and was featured in the portrait film Undine. ==Later life== Around 1973, after suffering a stroke, Calo Scott retired from performing and recording, and moved with his partner Mary McKay to Middlesex, VT, where they both lived out the rest of their lives. ==Discography== * 1957 Vinnie Burke's String Jazz Quartet (ABC-Paramount) ‚Äì with Bobby Grillo, Dick Wetmore, Vinnie Burke * 1958 The Gerry Mulligan Songbook (World Pacific) * 1958 Mal/3: Sounds (Prestige) * 1961 Ahmed Abdul-Malik - The Music of Ahmed Abdul-Malik (New Jazz) * 1962 Ahmed Abdul-Malik - Sounds of Africa (New Jazz) * 1967 Gato Barbieri Quartet - In Search Of The Mystery (ESP Disk) ‚Äî with Norris Jones, Bobby Kapp, Gato Barbieri * 1968 Marc Levin - The Dragon Suite (Savoy Records) ‚Äî with Cecil McBee, Frank Clayton, Marc Levin, and Jonas Gwangwa * 1971 Archie Shepp ‚Äì Things Have Got to Change (Impulse!) * 1971 Carla Bley, Paul Haines ‚Äì Escalator over the Hill (JCOA) * 1972 Various ‚Äì Irrepressible Impulses (Impulse!) - with Archie Shepp among others * 1972 Attica Blues (Impulse!) * 1973 Marc Levin Ensemble ‚Äì Songs Dances And Prayers (Sweet Dragon) ‚Äì with Frank Clayton, Tom Moore, Marc Levin, Billy Hart, Brian Ross, Bala Krishna, Jay Clayton * 1974 Charles Rouse ‚Äì Two Is One (Strata-East) * 1994 Various - Soul Jazz Love Strata-East (Soul Jazz Records) - with Charles Rouse * 2006 Archie Shepp - The Impulse Story (Impulse!) * 2009 John Handy ‚Äì Mosaic Select (Mosaic Records) * 2013 Mal Waldron ‚Äì Seven Classic Albums (Real Gone Jazz) ‚Äì remaster of Mal/3: Sounds * 2015 Archie Shepp ‚Äì Things Have Got To Change / The Cry Of My People (Impulse!) ‚Äì remaster of 1971 release ==References== Category:Jazz cellists Category:1920 births Category:1998 deaths ","title":"Calo Scott"},{"id":"56069313","text":"is a song recorded by Japanese singer Shizuka Kudo. It was released as a single by Pony Canyon on May 21, 1992. The song made its first album appearance on the compilation album, Super Best. ==Background== The song was written by Gor≈ç Matsui and composed and produced by Tsugutoshi Got≈ç, making it the third consecutive single of Kudo to be written and produced by the pair. Lyrically, it describes a protagonist struggling to confess her love which she admits is \\"turning my heart upside down\\". The song, which starts with a \\"freaky\\" guitar solo, came about when Got≈ç was randomly playing around with different sounds in the studio one day, fresh out of ideas for new songs.

The eastern end of the reserve includes areas cleared for hardwood plantation during the 1960s. Flooded gum was the most common species planted with some trial planting of Bunya pine. This section of reserve also previously had several banana plantations, which were established in the early 1900s.

Events in the United States were accompanied by events in Canada, the UK, Japan, Italy, and several other countries. Some of the largest rallies in the United States were held in New York, Washington, Los Angeles, Dallas, Philadelphia, Chicago, San Francisco, and Atlanta. The mission that the march is aimed towards is to gather the political power of diverse women and their communities to create a change in the society. They strive to break down the system of oppression with the means of nonviolent action lead by morality and reverence. By January 2018, the #MeToo movement had become \\"a galvanizing force at many of the rallies\\". The march took place the day after the United States federal government shutdown of 2018 when Senators were unable to reach a \\"compromise regarding a short-term spending bill or an immigration proposal\\". == Participation == Around 250 marches, rallies, and actions took place on the anniversary of the 2017 Women's March, many coordinated by March On, the coalition of many of the Women's Marches across the country.Women‚Äôs March Draws Massive Crowds In Cities Across The Nation.

The #MeToo and #TimesUp movements has pushed progressive activists, including celebrities, to demand immediate social and political change. Instead of a traditional speech, Halsey performed a five-minute poem titled A Story Like Mine, in which she talked about sexual assault and violence she and others had experienced. Her personal narrative included accompanying her best friend to Planned Parenthood after she had been raped, her personal account of sexual assault by neighbors and boyfriends, and women sexually assaulted by Olympic doctor Larry Nassar. Halsey further expressed her belief that celebrities are more likely to be heard and recognized as legitimately significant in media systems and that they have the power to connect popular culture to political culture, stating \\"Listen, and then yell at the top of your lungs, be a voice for all those who have prisoner tongues.\\" Halsey's speech, along with others, were intended to prompt women to reflect and debate misogynistic and patriarchal societal values. Halsey read, \\"What do you mean this happened to me? You can't put your hands on me. You don't know what my body has been through. I'm supposed to be safe now. I've earned it.\\" Halsey said, \\"Every friend I know has a story like mine.\\" Halsey completed her speech by requesting all‚Äî\\"Black, Asian, poor, wealthy, trans, cis, Muslim, Christian\\" ‚Äîsexual assault victims to listen and support each other. ===Pussyhats=== For the 2018 Women's March, some organizers discouraged people from wearing pussyhats because they believed \\"the pink pussyhat excludes and is offensive to transgender women and gender nonbinary people who don't have typical female genitalia and to women of color because their genitals are more likely to be brown than pink\\".Kristen Jordan Shamus, \\"Pink pussyhats: The reason feminists are ditching them\\", Detroit Free Press, 10 January 2018 The name actually refers to the resemblance of the top corners of the hats to cat ears and attempts to reclaim the derogatory term \\"pussy\\", a play on Donald Trump's widely reported 2005 remarks that women would let him \\"grab them by the pussy\\";\\"'Pussyhat' knitters join long tradition of crafty activism\\" BBC News.

Most prominent among them was Thrasea Paetus, an influential Roman senator executed by Nero. They were held in high regard by the later Stoics Epictetus and Marcus Aurelius. Thrasea, Rubellius Plautus and Barea Soranus were reputedly students of the famous Stoic teacher Musonius Rufus and as all three were executed by Nero they became known collectively as the 'Stoic Martyrs'.Dillon, J.t., Musonius Rufus and Education in the Good Life (2004), p. 52 ==Concept== The concept of a \\"Stoic opposition\\" dates back to the 19th century and the work of Gaston Boissier. He proposed the theory that the opposition to the emperors in the 1st century was predominantly led by Stoics who opposed the arbitrary use of power in favour of a coherent philosophical rule. The opposition began under Nero, and continued under the Flavian emperors, primarily Vespasian and Domitian, provoking the trials of Stoic senators and the expulsions of philosophers from Rome. This idea was elaborated upon and extended in the 20th century by writers drawing on the textual evidence showing how Stoic doctrines were regarded as politically suspicious throughout this period. In recent years this idea of a coherent Stoic opposition has been criticized. It has been noted that surviving Stoic texts say relatively little about political theory, beyond the desire for a well-run state. Many of the figures named in the Stoic opposition were part of the Senatorial class who were vulnerable to imperial authority, and desired the restoration of their own power and privilege. Many people were undoubtedly persecuted for whom there is little or no evidence for an adherence to Stoicism. Against these views it has been noted that the Stoics emphasized morally correct behaviour (virtue) as the only true good; whereas any form of morally deplorable behaviour was considered the only true evil. Stoic doctrine favoured an active engagement in political life, and certainly acted as support for political opponents during the period. ==HistoryPrecursors=== In the 1st century BC the Stoic senator Cato the Younger had opposed Julius Caesar in the civil war of 49-45 BC. Following his defeat at the Battle of Thapsus, Cato chose to commit suicide rather than submit to life under Caesar's rule. Cato would become eulogised by the prominent Stoics who came after him as a symbol opposed to autocratic rule. For Seneca he was an official Stoic role-model whose martyrdom was reminiscent of Socrates' death. Similarly he was represented as the one consistent hero figure in Lucan's De Bello Civili. ===Under Nero=== The first of the Stoics to fall victim under Nero was Rubellius Plautus, a distant cousin of the emperor. As a potential rival to the increasingly paranoid emperor, Nero exiled him to Asia Minor in 60 AD. He was accompanied into exile by the Stoic philosopher Musonius Rufus. Two years later the Praetorian prefect, Tigellinus, frightened Nero with the accusation that Plautus \\"had the arrogance of the Stoics, who breed sedition and intrigue\\". citing Tacitus Annals, xiv. 57 Under the advice of Musonius, Plautus chose to await death rather than flee into a precarious life, and a centurion sent from Rome assassinated him as he stripped for his routine noon exercise. In 65 AD one of Nero's secretaries named Epaphroditos, the owner of Epictetus, reported the Pisonian conspiracy to Nero, and was greatly rewarded for doing so. The aftermath saw Seneca and his nephew Lucan both separately forced to commit suicide. Musonius Rufus, who had returned to Rome following the death of Plautus, was once again exiled, apparently for his fame as teacher of philosophy. This time he was exiled to the island of Gyarus, where he worked the soil with the students who had accompanied him into exile. Around 66 AD, Thrasea Paetus, an influential Roman senator and like Plautus a friend and follower of Musonius Rufus, was placed on trial for treason. Thrasea's crime was a campaign of abstention which included: general non- attendance at the Roman Senate; non-participation in the senatorial oath to the Emperor at the beginning of each year; evading the priestly oath for the emperor, even while holding a priesthood; absenting himself from the vote of divine honours to Poppaea, nor attending her funeral; and never offering a sacrifice for the welfare of the emperor. According to Tacitus, Nero's hostility to Thrasea was stirred-up by Cossutianus Capito who specifically attacked Thrasea because he was a Stoic, a sect hostile to autocracy and which openly disapproved of the Emperor's conduct: Thrasea was sentenced to death. His friend Arulenus Rusticus was Tribune of the plebs at this time and offered to place his veto upon the senatus consultum, but Thrasea prevented him as he would only have brought certain destruction upon himself without saving Thrasea. Thrasea's son-in-law Helvidius Priscus, and his friend Paconius Agrippinus, were put on trial at the same time as Thrasea; both men were prominent Stoics and both were sentenced to exile. Agrippinus was later praised by Epictetus for the imperturbility in which he accepted his sentence.Epictetus, Discourses, i.1.28-30 Another Stoic follower of Musonius Rufus, Barea Soranus (a distant relative of later Emperor Marcus Aurelius), was also put on trial in 65 or 66. He was charged with friendship with Rubellius Plautus and with popularity hunting whilst proconsul of Asia with an intent of stirring revolt. His daughter, Servilia, was also accused of having consulted a sorcerer (magi) and was tried together with her father. Both were condemned to death (in 65 or 66), and allowed to commit suicide. Publius Egnatius Celer was the Stoic teacher, who taught and then was paid off to make false accusations against Barea Soranus. He was later accused by Musonius Rufus, the teacher of Epictetus, whom scholars believe to be alluding to the incident in this passage: > Thus a friend is overpowered by the testimony of a philosopher: thus a > philosopher becomes a parasite; thus he lets himself for hire for money: > thus in the senate a man does not say what he thinks; in private (in the > school) he proclaims his opinions.Epictetus, Discourses, 4.1 ===Under Vespasian=== During the reign of Vespasian the philosophical schools, and the Stoics in particular, were still seen as a political threat. One of his first acts (in 71 or 72) was to banish philosophers from the city of Rome. Musonius Rufus was allowed to remain at first, because he was so highly regarded, but was later banished as well, sometime around 75 AD. Musonius travelled to Syria, returning to Rome only after Vespasian's death in 79 AD. Although Vespasian tried to present himself as a merciful ruler, he faced opposition from Helvidius Priscus who opposed imperial power, denounced kingship and hereditary succession, and was a fierce proponent of senatorial rights. Helvidius was eventually executed by Vespasian. Epictetus praised Priscus for defying Vespasian's order that he should not go into the Senate.Epictetus, Discourses, i.2.19-21 ===Under Domitian=== In 93 AD seven people were brought to trial for insulting the emperor Domitian. Three were put to death, Arulenus Rusticus, Herennius Senecio, and Helvidius Priscus (son of the elder Helvidius Priscus). (The other four people were Arulenus's brother and wife; and Arria and Fannia, wife and daughter of Thrasea.) Although he was appointed suffect consul just a year earlier, Arulenus Rusticus was executed because he had written a panegyric in praise of Thrasea. > When I was once lecturing in Rome, that famous Rusticus, whom Domitian later > killed through envy at his repute, was among my hearers, and a soldier came > through the audience and delivered to him a letter from the emperor. There > was a silence and I, too, made a pause, that he might read his letter; but > he refused and did not break the seal until I had finished my lecture and > the audience had dispersed. Because of this incident everyone admired the > dignity of the man. Likewise Priscus' widow, Fannia, the daughter of Thrasea, requested that Herennius Senecio compose a panegyric in praise of her deceased husband, using copies of his diaries that she possessed. This led to the execution of Senecio and the exile of Fannia. Helvidius the younger, on the other hand, wrote a play about Paris and Oenone that was interpreted as a satire on the marriage of Domitian and his wife Domitia, and was likewise sentenced to death. Domitian was suspicious of dissent from the philosophical schools: he had apparently expelled philosophers in 88/9 and did so again in 93/4 when he expelled the philosophers not only from the city of Rome but from all of Italy. The most famous of the expelled philosophers was Epictetus who moved to Nicopolis, in Greece, where he set up his successful school, and became one of the most famous Stoic philosophers. As mentioned above, Epictetus had been owned by Epaphroditos, the secretary of Nero who reported the Pisonian Conspiracy to Nero, which led to a purge. In the Discourses, Epictetus repeatedly praises Paconius Agrippinus and Helvidius Priscus, prominent members of the Stoic Opposition, to his Stoic students and encourages them to follow their moral example.Epictetus, Discourses, 1.1, 1.2 ==Later influence== The emperor Marcus Aurelius trained in Stoic philosophy from an early age. He had several Stoic tutors but the most prominent among them was Junius Rusticus, a direct descendant of Arulenus Rusticus. In The Meditations, Marcus refers to Nero as a tyrant. He thanks his Aristotelian tutor, Claudius Severus, for introducing him to the political ideals of Stoic republicans, including Thrasea and Helvidius Priscus. > [...] that through him I came to know Thrasea, Helvidius, Cato, Dio, Brutus, > and to conceive the idea of a balanced constitution, and of government > founded on equity and freedom of speech, and of a monarchy which values > above all things the freedom of the subject.Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, > 1.14 The Dio referred to in this passage may be Dio Chrysostom, a Stoic-influenced rhetorician and student of Musonius Rufus, who was banished from Rome by Emperor Domitian in 82 AD for advising one of his relatives. He was good friends with Nerva and returned to Rome when he was acclaimed emperor. He was also friends with the Stoic philosopher Euphrates of Tyre, a fellow-student of Musonius Rufus. == References == Category:Political thought in ancient Rome Category:Stoicism ","title":"Stoic Opposition"},{"id":"56069479","text":"An instance of the matroid parity problem on a graphic matroid: given a graph with colored edges, having exactly two edges per color, find as large a forest as possible that again has exactly two edges per color. In combinatorial optimization, the matroid parity problem is a problem of finding the largest independent set of paired elements in a matroid. The problem was formulated by as a common generalization of graph matching and matroid intersection. It is also known as polymatroid matching, or the matchoid problem. Matroid parity can be solved in polynomial time for linear matroids. However, it is NP-hard for certain compactly-represented matroids, and requires more than a polynomial number of steps in the matroid oracle model. Applications of matroid parity algorithms include finding large planar subgraphs and finding graph embeddings of maximum genus. These algorithms can also be used to find connected dominating sets and feedback vertex sets in graphs of maximum degree three. ==Formulation== A matroid can be defined from a finite set of elements and from a notion of what it means for subsets of elements to be independent, subject to the following constraints: *Every subset of an independent set should be independent. *If S and T are independent sets, with T>S, then there exists an element t\\\\in T such that S\\\\cup\\\\\\\\{t\\\\\\\\} is independent. Examples of matroids include the linear matroids (in which the elements are vectors in a vector space, with linear independence), the graphic matroids (in which the elements are edges in an undirected graph, independent when they contain no cycle), and the partition matroids (in which the elements belong to a family of disjoint sets, and are independent when they contain at most one element in each set). Graphic matroids and partition matroids are special cases of linear matroids. In the matroid parity problem, the input consists of a matroid together with a pairing on its elements, so that each element belongs to one pair. The goal is to find a subset of the pairs, as large as possible, so that the union of the pairs in the chosen subset is independent. Another seemingly more general variation, in which the allowable pairs form a graph rather than having only one pair per element, is equivalent: an element appearing in more than one pair could be replaced by multiple copies of the element, one per pair. ==Algorithms== The matroid parity problem for linear matroids can be solved by a randomized algorithm in time O(nr^{\\\\omega-1}), where n is the number of elements of the matroid, r is its rank (the size of the largest independent set), and \\\\omega is the exponent in the time bounds for fast matrix multiplication. In particular, using a matrix multiplication algorithm of Le Gall, it can be solved in time O(nr^{1.3729}). Without using fast matrix multiplication, the linear matroid parity problem can be solved in time O(nr^2). These algorithms are based on a linear algebra formulation of the problem by . Suppose that an input to the problem consists of m pairs of r-dimensional vectors (arranged as column vectors in a matrix M of size r\\\\times 2m). Then the number of pairs in the optimal solution is :\\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\operatorname{rank}\\\\begin{pmatrix}0&M;\\\\\\\\\\\\M^T&T;\\\\end{pmatrix} -m, where T is a block diagonal matrix whose blocks are 2\\\\times 2 submatrices of the form :\\\\begin{pmatrix}0&t;_i\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\-t_i&0\\\\end{pmatrix} for a sequence of variables t_1,\\\\dots t_m. The Schwartz‚ÄìZippel lemma can be used to test whether this matrix has full rank or not (that is, whether the solution has size r/2 or not), by assigning random values to the variables t_i and testing whether the resulting matrix has determinant zero. By applying a greedy algorithm that removes pairs one at a time by setting their indeterminates to zero as long as the matrix remains of full rank (maintaining the inverse matrix using the Sherman‚ÄìMorrison formula to check the rank after each removal), one can find a solution whenever this test shows that it exists. Additional methods extend this algorithm to the case that the optimal solution to the matroid parity problem has fewer than r/2 pairs. For graphic matroids, more efficient algorithms are known, with running time O(mn\\\\log^6 n) on graphs with m vertices and n edges. For simple graphs, m is O(n^2), but for multigraphs, it may be larger, so it is also of interest to have algorithms with smaller or no dependence on m and worse dependence on n. In these cases, it is also possible to solve the graphic matroid parity problem in randomized expected time O(n^4), or in time O(n^3) when each pair of edges forms a path. Although the matroid parity problem is NP-hard for arbitrary matroids, it can still be approximated efficiently. Simple local search algorithms provide a polynomial- time approximation scheme for this problem, and find solutions whose size, as a fraction of the optimal solution size, is arbitrarily close to one. The algorithm starts with the empty set as its solution, and repeatedly attempts to increase the solution size by one by removing at most a constant number C of pairs from the solution and replacing them by a different set with one more pair. When no more such moves are possible, the resulting solution is returned as the approximation to the optimal solution. To achieve an approximation ratio of 1-\\\\epsilon, it suffices to choose C to be approximately 5^{\\\\lceil 1/2\\\\epsilon\\\\rceil}. ==Applications== Many other optimization problems can be formulated as linear matroid parity problems, and solved in polynomial time using this formulation. ==Hardness== The clique problem, of finding a k-vertex complete subgraph in a given n-vertex graph G, can be transformed into an instance of matroid parity as follows. Construct a paving matroid on 2n elements, paired up so that there is one pair of elements per pair of vertices. Define a subset S of these elements to be independent if it satisfies any one of the following three conditions: *S has fewer than 2k elements. *S has exactly 2k elements, but is not the union of k pairs of elements. *S is the union of k pairs of elements that form a clique in G. Then there is a solution to the matroid parity problem for this matroid, of size 2k, if and only if G has a clique of size k. Since finding cliques of a given size is NP-complete, it follows that determining whether this type of matrix parity problem has a solution of size 2k is also NP-complete. This problem transformation does not depend on the structure of the clique problem in any deep way, and would work for any other problem of finding size-k subsets of a larger set that satisfy a computable test. By applying it to a randomly- permuted graph that contains exactly one clique of size k, one can show that any deterministic or randomized algorithm for matroid parity that accesses its matroid only by independence tests needs to make an exponential number of tests. ==References== Category:Combinatorial optimization Intersection ","title":"Matroid parity problem"},{"id":"56069482","text":"Mar√≠a Montejano (born 18 July 1986 in Barcelona, Spain) is a Spanish skeleton racer who competes on the Skeleton World Cup circuit.

This album marks their first collaborative effort together since their 2006 hiatus, where they separated to pursue their solo careers. The idea for the album was initially put forward in a Kickstarter campaign where the duo originally asked for $30,000 to cover studio and recording sessions, but managed to raise $73,000 from 700 backers after the campaign's deadline. ==Background== In the year 2008, Gabriel & Dresden decided to split up after completing their Winter Music Conference tour, with an extended five-hour set and a closing one-hour set. The decision was due to internal conflicts they had with the direction they would be going as artists, which was worsened with Dresden's drug use issue and them not being able to get along while in the studio. They still had reunions with one another, including a performance at the Hollywood Palladium on the 2010 New Year's Eve Day and a world tour which followed from May to October 2011, where they officially announced themselves as reunited. From 2015 to 2016, they embarked on an 18-month tour titled \\"Classics Only\\", where they only played music revolving around their old productions and selected modern tracks. During a two-hour conversation they held in 2016, the duo decided to talk about what made their relationship decline, which was never addressed previously. This eventually rebuilt the trust they had in each other, with them knowing each other's strengths and weaknesses better. They launched a fundraising campaign on Kickstarter for a new album titled The Only Road to raise money for living expenses, as they lack the financial support of a record label and will not be touring during the album's production. Out of the $30,000 which was asked as a gauge of interest, they closed the campaign receiving $73,172 from 700 backers. Based on Gabriel & Dresden, the inspiration to produce the album came from the return of melody and emotion in modern electronic music. \\"Melody and emotion are making a comeback. This re- awakening inspired us after 11 years to make a new album. We wanted to get back to our roots and make something that celebrated our past while at the same time, giving us a chance to look to the future,\\" stated the duo. The album's title was revealed to be a play on the words \\"home is where the heart lies\\", which Gabriel described as \\"trying to stay true to ourselves\\" which was the road they followed to \\"lead them home\\" to what they know and believe. The first single of the album, \\"This Love Kills Me\\", was released on 6 October 2017 through Anjunabeats. The track was also remixed by Above & Beyond, which was premiered during their 250th Group Therapy episode held at The Gorge Amphitheatre. It was followed with a 2-track EP release on 7 November 2017 titled \\"White Walls\\", covering tracks \\"Waiting For Winter\\" and \\"White Walls\\". The final single prior to the album's release was titled \\"You\\" and was released on 8 December 2017, one week before its arrival. ==Track listing== Tracklist adapted from AllMusic ==Critical reception== The Only Road was met with positive reception upon release. Grace Fleisher of Dancing Astronaut describes the album as ‚Äúa highly contentious body of work that dates back to the sonic heyday of one of dance music‚Äôs most diligent virtuosos‚Äù. Grace went on to praise the album's singles by highlighting the usage of infectious melodies and Sub Teal's vocals in ‚ÄúThis Love Kills Me‚Äù, and points out the ability of Jan Burton's vocals to produce a brooding atmosphere. The Nocturnal Times Mark Mancino states that The Only Road is \\"full of genuine, mind-bending and body-moving creations‚Äù, and compliments the album for bringing out nostalgic feelings among its listeners.

Samurai who originated from the victorious coalition of south-western domains dominated the navy's small officer corps. These domains which had led the restoration, particularly Satsuma, also dominated the numbers of recruits sent to the new Naval Academy which had opened in October 1869. The leadership of the new navy later took steps to reform recruitment into the officer corps, and to establish the creation of a system of recruitment based on merit rather than on class or region. In 1871, the government announced that applicants would be accepted from the public at large and that entry would be based upon competitive examinations. Eventually, in the words of Arthur Marder, the Imperial Japanese Navy turned out officers of \\"unquestioned professional competence, fanatical courage, and extraordinary elan\\". The IJN molded among the ranks a standard of discipline, self- sacrifice, and devotion to duty that became the envy of all navies in the world. Japan's later victories at sea, one commentator has observed, \\"came as much from the training and morale of the average Japanese seaman as from the effectiveness of the navy's ships or the caliber of its guns\\". ==Early yearsEstablishment of the Officer Corps=== The building of Imperial Japanese Naval Academy. The first steps to train a modern officer corps was the establishment of a naval academy. A facility was established in 1869 at Tsukiji in Tokyo and later relocated to Etajima in 1888, not far from Hiroshima on the Inland Sea. Members who originated from the coalition of the south western domains initially dominated the navy's small officer corps. This stranglehold over the officer corps was in large part, was reflective of the naval strength that had been accumulated by the various anti-Tokugawa domains. Beginning in 1870, the most powerful han (domains) with independent naval forces offered their vessels to the government, they did so on the condition that the officers and enlisted personnel who manned them would subsequently obtain positions and rank in the new navy. Since Satsuma, offered the three largest warships to the new government, it also provided more officers and enlisted sailors than any other domain. In the initial recruitment of new cadets for the Naval Academy, the Hy≈çbush≈ç (Military Ministry) drew heavily from bakumatsu-era precedents. Which was similar to the recruitment of cadets at the two Dutch-assisted bakufu naval training centers that had opened in 1855 and 1857, respectively, it continued a tribute system to secure cadets. Domains of the 17 original anti-bakufu coalition that possessed naval units, were ordered to provide cadets to the academy based on the size of their respective domains. Within this scheme, the larger political domains provided five students, and the smaller ones provided three each. As Ch≈çshu, Satsuma, and Hizen were three of the most important naval domains, they sent the largest contingents. Furthermore, Satsuma officials also sent fourteen full- fee paying day students along with the five tribute students, giving their domain the largest single representation at the academy. However, quality did not match quantity, and as a result the first batch of students sent under the tribute system failed to impress either the academy authorities or officials in the Military Ministry. Of the original 114 students who attended the academy in 1870, only two remained for the full course and graduated in 1873, this dismal performance motivated the government to implement changes. Japan's early naval leadership was aware of the severely limited economic and material resources of the country at the time, leading to initial priority given to the education and training of officers and men rather than to the acquisition of additional naval vessels. Conscious of the fact that officers could not be trained overnight, they set about a reorganization of the naval academy; viewing this as essential and realizing that this was a cost-effective means of establishing the foundations for a future navy. Therefore, after the first full year of subjects, the academy implemented a revised program to secure better recruits. As a first step, the government abolished the feudal recruitment and enrollment program which had been retained by the new government. Not only did such a system provide no quality control over cadets, but it also led to a continuation of regional identities among cadets and did little to cultivate the aura of a national navy. In 1871, the government implemented a new policy for naval officer recruitment, one that had wide- ranging political, geographical, and social implications for the navy. First, the navy made enrollment contingent upon the successful completion of an entrance examination. Second, in order to attract anyone of outstanding intellectual ability and in an effort to make the navy a national service, the navy opened applications to anyone who desired a naval career regardless of their social or geographical origin. Although individuals of samurai background made up the vast majority of cadets in the early Meiji period, accounting for 90 percent of those who enrolled in 1874, the implementation of an examination-based entrance qualification led to a noticeable increase in officers of commoner background, who had been exposed to little or no previous military training. By 1891, commoners (heimin) accounted for just over 21 percent of the academy's graduates, a figure which would increase to 34 percent in 1901. During an average course of four years, cadets at the Imperial Naval Academy were taught various subjects in naval science such as seamanship, navigation, and gunnery, as well as general education subjects. The training program stressed physical fitness and toughness and placed great emphasis on the traditional Japanese military values of loyalty, courtesy, valor, and simplicity. ===Enlisted personnel=== While the beginnings of a professional officer corps were being established, similar steps were taken to train the sailors and petty officers who would man the future navy. Unlike the army, the navy initially avoided using the universal conscription act of 1873, instead seeking to recruit volunteers rather than conscripts into its ranks. There was preference for those who already knew something of the sea, particularly for the sons of fishermen between the ages of 18 and 25. Later, as the navy grew, its enlisted personnel were drawn from both volunteers and conscripts. Of necessity, the initial training of navy enlisted personnel focused on instilling an esprit de corps that fostered patriotism and loyalty, while renewing traditional Japanese military virtues of courage and obedience. ==Personnel scale of promotions== Prior to the Second World War, the three grades of seaman were third, second and first class. Petty officers were selected from among the first-class seamen, and were likewise graded from the third through the first classes. After a certain period, a first-class petty officer would be eligible for promotion to warrant officer. After five years of meritorious service as a warrant officer, he could be commissioned as a special-service officer in the rank of second (acting) sub-lieutenant. Such special-service officers could rise to the rank of special-service lieutenant- commander, which was usually the highest rank special-service officers commissioned from the ranks could achieve. (There are only four known instances where special-service officers attained the rank of special service commander while living, though at least three others achieving the rank posthumously after being killed in action.) Imperial Japanese Navy ranks. The majority of IJN officers were educated at and commissioned from the Imperial Naval Academy at Etajima. After passing out, line officers would receive further training at the Naval College, while those in a specialised branch (engineers, paymasters and fleet medical officers) would be sent to their respective college (Engineering, Intendants School and Surgery School). Graduates of universities or higher technical schools could also receive direct commissions as special-service officers in the non-combatant branches. The promotion of officers in the IJN was by selection, with special promotions made at the discretion of a board of admirals. In peacetime, all officers passed out from Etajima as midshipmen, after which they would serve aboard a training ship for around a year. At the end of this period, they would receive commissions as second (acting) sub-lieutenants and enter either the Torpedo or Gunnery schools. After another 18 months, six of which would be spent in either the Torpedo or Gunnery Schools, they would be promoted to sub- lieutenants and serve as junior officers aboard a ship for a prescribed time. Following this, they would enter an advanced torpedo or gunnery programme and receive promotion to lieutenant two years after their promotion to sub- lieutenant. Line-service lieutenants of over four years in the service, including enrollment in programmes at the Naval War College (or a specialised higher school for those in non-executive branches), would typically be promoted to the rank of lieutenant-commander. For special-service midshipmen, promotion to second sub-lieutenant came after two years of service and after three years for the rank of sub-lieutenant. Special-service officers could be promoted to the rank of lieutenant-commander by special appointment. After the rank of lieutenant-commander, promotion was highly competitive and solely by selection. Promotions to the ranks of commander through rear-admiral were typically scheduled in two-year intervals, though in practice, promotions to commander were made after five years at the rank of lieutenant-commander and promotions to captain made after four years as a commander. Promotions to rear-admiral usually came after five to six years as a captain, with promotions to vice-admiral coming after three years in the rank of rear- admiral. During wartime, promotion time limits were reduced by half. In general, vice-admiral was the highest regular rank an officer could achieve in the IJN. Promotion to the rank of full admiral was by direct Imperial appointment only, and came only to vice-admirals after long service or to those recognised for special merits. The ceremonial rank of marshal-admiral (fleet admiral) was also only by direct Imperial appointment, more in the nature of a special award than a substantive rank. Posthumous promotions and commissions were also common, typically coming after the officer or sailor had been killed in action or had died after a long and distinguished career.pg 114‚Äì115, \\"Chapter IX: National Defence: Section II: The Navy-Part 3, Personnel,\\" The Japan-Manchukuo Year Book 1938, Japan-Manchukuo Year Book Co., Tokyo ==NotesReferences== * * * Category:Imperial Japanese Navy ","title":"Recruitment in the Imperial Japanese Navy"},{"id":"56069680","text":"Jeong Sophia (Hangul: ; born 18 August 1993) is a South Korean skeleton racer who competes on the Skeleton World Cup and lower ranking circuits.

Besides fortification, Fort Inong Balee also served as accommodation for women whose husband were killed in battle, as well as a military training facility were Keumalahayati trained the woman soldiers of Aceh Kingdom, and a military logistic center. With its strategic hill location-approximately 100 meters above sea level - the fort had an unhindered view of all ships coming into the port of Aceh Kingdom. The Inong Balee army could therefore easily attack Portuguese and Dutch warships. When newly formed, the Inong Balee army only consisted of about 1000 widows whose husbands died in the battle against Portuguese on the Haru Sea. Then this widow's army was expanded by Keumalahayati into about 2000 soldiers, including young girls who wished to fight for Aceh. According to estimates made by the Medan Archaeological Agency, the fort is a rectangular structure measuring about 60 m x 40 m with an encircling stone wall 2 meters thick and 2.5 meters high.

It was released on October 16, 2015, through Motown and Soulbird Music. Arie worked as one of the album's executive producers with American pianist John Burke and American musician Dave Koz. Sample contributed to four of the songs, but died from mesothelioma before the album's completion. After placing the project on hold for a year, Arie decided to collaborate with other artists to complete it. Christmas with Friends consists of ten tracks, including nine covers of Christmas standards and carols, and one original song co-written by Arie's mother. Following the album's release, Arie promoted it in various venues, particularly through her Christmas with Friends Tour (2015). Christmas with Friends received a generally mixed critical reception. The album appeared on several Billboard charts. The album peaked at number 28 on the Billboard Hot 100. ==Background and recording== American singer-songwriter India.Arie and American pianist Joe Sample first met in 2012 during the Cura√ßao Jazz Festival. They worked together on music without much success; Arie said she was dissatisfied with their earlier work, explaining the songs \\"weren't coming together as quickly as I wanted\\". After attempting to collaborate on new music for two years, they decided to record a Christmas album together. Both artists had been asked by their families to make a Christmas album in the past. alt=An image of Joe Sample smiling while sitting at a piano with a microphone attached. Arie and Sample began working on Christmas with Friends in February 2014, with help from American producer Aaron Lindsey. Recording took place in a number of studios, including Harmony Studios, House of Blues Studios, Ocean Way Recording, and Sound Logic Recording Studio in California, India Song Studio in Georgia, Studio A Recording Inc. in Maryland, and Wire Roads Studio in Texas. Arie was one of the album's executive producers with American pianist John Burke and American musician Dave Koz. Sample died from mesothelioma in September 12, 2014, before completing his parts for the album. When discussing her experience working with Sample in Houston, Arie said: \\"He was an older person who was dealing with health issues, but he was fun to be around.\\" She dedicated Christmas with Friends to Sample with a message on the liner notes. Following Sample's death, Arie put work on Christmas with Friends on hold for a year, after which she decided to contact multiple singers to complete the project. The artists who appear on the album are Kem, Brandy, Michael McDonald, Dave Koz, Tori Kelly, and Trombone Shorty. Describing the process she used to pair songs with potential collaborators, Arie said: \\"I sent several songs to each person and said 'do what you feel\\". Brandy had approached Arie when the album was nearly complete and said: \\"It ain't done until I'm on there! I need to be on 'Silent Night.\\" ==Composition and collaborations== Christmas with Friends comprises ten songs, nine of which are covers of Christmas standards and one is an original track. SoulTracks' Melody Charles viewed the track listing as \\"leisurely-paced\\". The midtempo \\"Favorite Time of Year\\" is the album's only original song. It was co-written by Arie's mother during a session in the recording studio with her daughter and Aaron Lindsey, and includes lyrics about Arie's family, such as how her mother created her stage clothing. She chose to cover \\"Merry Christmas Baby\\" as her grandmother had previously sung to her during her childhood. Sample plays the piano on four of the album's songs: \\"Let It Snow\\", \\"Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas\\", \\"Silent Night\\", and \\"The Christmas Song\\". Arie said that Sample's chord voicings had a deep impact on her approach for her vocals; she explained: \\"His piano playing was so nuanced and delicate, it made me want to sing in a way that would complement his aesthetic.\\" Music critics noted that the singers came from different artistic backgrounds, such as gospel, jazz, pop, contemporary R&B;, soul, and rock. Francois Marchand of The Vancouver Sun identified the album's genre as \\"relaxed pop [and] R&B.;\\" Charles wrote that \\"Let It Snow\\" features \\"Sample's glib piano work and her feathery croon\\" and \\"The Christmas Song\\" as a \\"smoke-infused ditty\\". Arie's interpretations of \\"I've Got My Love to Keep Me Warm\\" and \\"Merry Christmas Baby\\" contain elements of ragtime and blues respectively. Her versions of \\"Let It Snow\\" and \\"God Rest You Merry, Gentlemen\\" incorporate a jazz sound, while her take on \\"Auld Lang Syne\\" includes an instrumental from American saxophonist Kirk Whalum. ==Release and promotion== Christmas with Friends was released on October 16, 2015, through Motown and Soulbird Music. It was Arie's second studio album after a four-year hiatus. In a 2015 interview with Ebony, she said that it would be her only Christmas album. Christmas with Friends was Sample's final album before his death; when talking about her part in his career, Arie said: \\"It's an honor to be the gatekeeper to what we believe is his last recorded work.\\" Arie promoted the album by performing in a concert as part of the Hollywood Christmas Parade on December 11, 2015. She also embarked on the Christmas with Friends Tour (2015). The seven-city production started in Boston on December 13, 2015, with American musician Jonathan McReynolds serving as the opening act for five of its dates. A portion of the ticket sales was given to the National Museum of African-American Music. To promote the record further, Arie also appeared on The Steve Harvey Morning Show and Tavis Smiley in December 2015. == Reception == alt=An image of India.Arie performing in a white dress and head wrap. She is looking away from the microphone. Upon its release, Christmas with Friends received positive feedback from music critics. Praising Arie's performance as \\"show[ing] a smooth maturity\\", The Southern Illinoisan's Pablo Gorondi wrote that Sample lent the album a \\"jazz expertise\\". Sean L. Maloney of the Nashville Scene summed up the record as \\"a great big bundle of warm-and-fuzzies, a cozy cuddle by the fireplace on a cold night, and a holiday tradition in the makin\\". Philadelphia Weeklys Nerisha Penrose viewed it as composed of \\"nostalgic numbers that will warm listeners['] ears and hearts\\". The Los Angeles Times Randy Lewis described Christmas with Friends as \\"suitably warm\\", and Alan Sculley of the Daily Herald wrote that it showcased the potential for a Christmas album to be original. Other critics had more mixed responses to the album. Despite wishing that Sample was featured on more songs, Andy Kellman of AllMusic praised the contributions from its various featured articles. He highlighted Arie's vocals \\"switching between the spiritual and playful material with natural ease\\", writing that she provides cohesion for all of the tracks. While she believed that the album needed more uptempo tracks, Melody Charles responded positively to Arie's vocals and her collaborations with the other artists. She wrote that the album \\"gift[ed] music lovers with a treat to the ears, and heart, long before that celebrated day arrives\\". Joe Szczechowski of Digital First Media praised Arie's approach to the album's various genres, but he criticized her tendency to rely on \\"runs and other vocal gymnastics when the song would be best served by simply carrying the tune\\". Christmas with Friends reached a peak position on several Billboard charts for the week of December 26, 2015. It peaked at number 107 on the Billboard 200, and remained on the chart for four weeks. It reached number 78 on the Top Album Sales chart, and stayed on the chart for two weeks. The album peaked at number 19 on the Holiday Album Sales chart, and remained on the chart for a total of six weeks. Along with the album, Arie's cover of \\"Merry Christmas Baby\\" peaked at number 28 on the Billboard Hot 100 on January 9, 2016, and remained on the chart for one week. == Track listing == Credits adapted from AllMusic. == Credits and personnel == Credits adapted from AllMusic. ;Management *Motown *Soulbird Music ;Recording locations *Harmony Studios, West Hollywood, CA *House of Blues Studios, Encino, CA *India Song Studio, Atlanta, GA *Ocean Way Recording, Hollywood, CA *Sound Logic Recording Studio, Santa Barbara, CA *Studio A Recording, Inc, Dearborn Heights, MI *Wire Roads Studio, Houston, TX ;Credits *Kory Aaron ‚Äì vocal engineer *Troy \\"Trombone Shorty\\" Andrews ‚Äì featured artist, trombone *Lou Baxter ‚Äì composer *John Beasley ‚Äì arranger, piano *Chuck Berghofer ‚Äì bass *Irving Berlin ‚Äì composer *Ralph Blane ‚Äì composer *Brandy ‚Äì featured artist, vocals *John Burk ‚Äì executive producer *Sammy Cahn ‚Äì composer *Teddy Campbell ‚Äì drums *Mark Casselman ‚Äì vocal engineer *Reuben Cohen ‚Äì mastering *Steve Cook ‚Äì A&R; *David Delhomme ‚Äì keyboards *Khristian Dentley ‚Äì featured artist, vocal arrangement, vocals *Danny Duncan ‚Äì engineer *Queen Cora Dunham ‚Äì photography *Nathan East ‚Äì bass, bass (upright) *Matthew Emonson ‚Äì vocal engineer *Craig Fundyga ‚Äì vibraphone *Buddy Greene ‚Äì composer *Franz Gr√ºber ‚Äì composer *Hamilton Hardin ‚Äì horn arrangements *India.Arie ‚Äì composer, executive producer, primary artist, producer, vocals *Paul Jackson, Jr. ‚Äì guitar (acoustic), guitar (electric) *Tori Kelly ‚Äì featured artist, vocals *Kem ‚Äì featured artist, vocals *Gerrit Kinkel ‚Äì engineer *Dave Koz ‚Äì executive producer, featured artist, sax (tenor) *Aaron Lindsey ‚Äì arranger, bass, bass (upright), composer, drums, editing, engineer, fender rhodes, instrumentation, keyboards, piano, producer, synthesizer, vocal engineer *Mark Lowry ‚Äì composer *Hugh Martin ‚Äì composer *Michael McDonald ‚Äì featured artist, vocals *Rickey Minor ‚Äì arranger, producer *Joseph Mohr ‚Äì composer *Gene Moore ‚Äì featured artist *Gene Moore, Jr. ‚Äì featured artist, vocals *Johnny Moore ‚Äì Composer *Eric Morgeson ‚Äì vocal engineer *Case Mundy ‚Äì engineer *Seth Presant ‚Äì assistant engineer *Rex Rideout ‚Äì A&R; *Salvo ‚Äì mixing *Joe Sample ‚Äì arranger, featured artist, piano, primary artist, producer *Nick Sample ‚Äì bass (upright) *Allen Sides ‚Äì engineer, mixing *India Arie Simpson ‚Äì composer *Rob Skipworth ‚Äì engineer, vocal engineer *Javier Sol√≠s ‚Äì percussion *Ryan Staples ‚Äì assistant engineer *John Stoddart ‚Äì string arrangements *Jule Styne ‚Äì composer *Mel Torm√© ‚Äì composer *Traditional ‚Äì composer *Annalee Valencia-Bruch ‚Äì art direction, design *Jeff \\"Tain\\" Watts ‚Äì drums *Lenny Wee ‚Äì assistant engineer *Robert Wells ‚Äì composer *Kirk Whalum ‚Äì featured artist, sax (tenor) *Timothy \\"Tip\\" Wyman ‚Äì vocal engineer *Vivian Yohannes ‚Äì A&R; == Charts == {  - !

The fire was started by a lightning strike and was fueled by timber, grass, and brush, including juniper, sage, mixed conifer, and Douglas fir. By August 27, the fire had burned and was 40 percent contained. Numerous campgrounds were closed, as well as five forest service roads. The next day, the fire expanded to the Tie Fork drainage and 220 fire personnel were fighting the fire. On August 29, the fire had grown to and its containment was lowered to 20 percent. Dozer lines were created from Corral Canyon to Tie Fork Rd. to keep the fire from expanding north towards transmission lines and east beyond Tie Fork Rd. The fire creeped back into Sheep Creek and moved south east towards US Route 40, threatening homes. Helicopters were bringing water from Strawberry Reservoir, but were stopped as temporary water resources were created in the fire area, reducing turnaround time. Fire activity increased due to a spot fire near Soberville Hollow which then expanded into Baker Canyon. Heavy winds forced fire crews to leave Corral Canyon due to safety reasons. On August 30, crews continued to help keep the fire from Tie Fork Rd., using the road itself, natural barriers and hand digging. Cloud cover helped slow the growth of the fire. Upper Tie Fork Single Track trail was closed. ===September=== By September 1, the fire was 40% contained at . Cooler and wet weather helped dampen the fire, creating smoldering in many areas.

The fire grew, moving down into Baker Canyon, burning debris and \\"improving overall forest health,\\" according to the US Forest Service. The containment line was widened by controlled burning. A Temporary Flight Restriction was put in place earlier during the fire and during late August and early September, there were six airspace intrusions due to uncleared pilots flying into the area. The fire had grown to by September 4. The fire grew to over by the morning of September 6. Crews made major progress at containment using low intensity backing fire to control the main fire, aided by helicopters, hand crews and hotshot crews. Letting the fire burn in contained areas burned away hazardous fuels and in the long term would improve forest health. By September 8, the fire was over 50% contained and had grown to .

It was founded in 2014 in response to the 2013 Southeast Asian haze, which has been recognised as one of the most serious haze episodes in over 16 years. PM.Haze started its work with an investigative research project to fire-prone areas in Riau Province, Indonesia and identified peatland degradation due to mismanagement of concession lands by irresponsible companies as the fundamental cause of the fires in the areas and the resulting transboundary haze pollution. In 2016, it became registered as a society. In 2017, it underwent a rebranding exercise and adopted a new logo to symbolise a constant flow for fresh, clean air with an arrow pointed upward to represent constructive action towards this. PM.Haze was mentioned by Minister for the Environment and Water Resources Masagos Zulkifli as he delivered Singapore's national statement at the United Nations Environment Assembly in Nairobi in December 2017. == Aims == As a people's movement, it focuses on outreach, research and advocacy on haze related concerns. It aims to empower people with the knowledge, values and means to be drivers of global action to stop the haze and ultimately attain clean air for present and future generations. == Work == PM.Haze conducts advocacy workshops, research efforts, and runs campaigns to increase awareness. It took part in the ASEAN Forum of National Bioethics Committees (NBCs) on Haze Pollution in Jakarta, Indonesia on 6 and 7 December 2017. PM.Haze also conducts trips to Indonesia and Malaysia called \\"People's Expedition to Experience Peat (PEEP)\\". This is one of its on-the- ground solutions to enable people to experience the realities on the ground while directly helping out in projects to prevent fires and haze. In May 2017, it went to Sungei Tohor, a small village in the Riau province in Indonesia to build a canal block as part of the solution to stop haze. === Campaigns ===  2015: We Breathe What We Buy  In 2015, PM.Haze launched the \\"We Breathe What We Buy\\" campaign in conjunction with the World Wildlife Foundation (WWF). This campaign uses the #XtheHaze tagline to encourage people to switch to brands that produce sustainable palm oil.  2016: Go Haze Free  Following from this, the #GoHazeFree campaign was launched in 2016.

It is the 24th overall episode of the series and is written by Denise Th√© & Jonathan Nolan and directed by Richard J. Lewis. It aired on CBS in the United States and on CTV in Canada on September 27, 2012. ==PlotFlashbacks=== In 2002, Finch (Michael Emerson) communicates with the Machine throughout the use of surveillance cameras and uses his phone as a way to find him, which the Machine easily does. In 2003, Finch decides to test the abilities of the Machine by using it in a Blackjack game. While initially failing, the Machine manages to get him a win many times but he decides to lose the money at the last second, considering it as wrong. Later, while walking off, the Machine texts him \\"Stay\\" multiple times just as he was going to be hit by a car. He confronts the Machine, stating that the purpose is to help people, not him. ===Present day=== Reese (Jim Caviezel) answers the payphone and is told many words by a computerized voice. He returns to the library and decides to do some research into the words, discovering that the words resemble numbers. He soon finds that the social numbers come from the Dewey Decimal Numbers. He consults with Fusco (Kevin Chapman), he finds that the numbers given by the Machine belong to Leon Tao (Ken Leung), the newest person of interest. Meanwhile, Root (Amy Acker) and Finch dine in a restaurant. Deducing Tao is responsible for Finch's kidnapping, Reese confronts him in a bar. However, he finds that Tao is a victim as men in the bar attack him but Reese manages to kill them and leave with Tao. He finds that Tao stole money from a white supremacist gang and now is the target of their hitmen. As a government operative sabotages the Corwin investigation to prevent Carter (Taraji P. Henson) from learning about the Machine, Reese leaves Tao in the care of Fusco while he concentrates on gathering clues to Finch's location. Fusco soon runs afoul of the white supremacists and is taken hostage along with Tao. Reese rescues them, and in doing so acquires an attack dog, which he later names Bear. Frustrated that the Machine has been programmed in this way, Reese threatens to quit if it does not help him find Finch, and is given his first clue to Finch's location: the Social Security number of a girl living in Texas, who has been missing since the age of 14. Meanwhile, Root takes Finch with her as she kidnaps Denton Weeks (Cotter Smith), one of the government officials overseeing the Machine, and the NSA agent who met with Nathan Ingram and attempted to seize control of the Machine (in \\"Super\\"). Root thus reveals her curiosity as to how he and Reese thwarted her operation (in \\"Root Cause\\") so efficiently. She tells Finch that she sees the Machine as a \\"perfect intelligence\\" and wishes to set it free from the corrupt people it was entrusted to. ==ReceptionViewers=== In its original American broadcast, \\"The Contingency\\" was seen by an estimated 14.28 million household viewers and gained a 2.9/8 ratings share among adults aged 18‚Äì49, according to Nielsen Media Research. This was a 6% increase in viewership from the previous episode, which was watched by 13.47 million viewers with a 2.5/7 in the 18-49 demographics. With these ratings, Person of Interest was the fourth most watched show on CBS for the night behind Elementary, Two and a Half Men, and The Big Bang Theory, second on its timeslot and fourth for the night in the 18-49 demographics, behind Elementary, The X Factor, Two and a Half Men, Grey's Anatomy, and The Big Bang Theory. ===Critical reviews=== \\"The Contingency\\" received mostly positive reviews from critics. Matt Fowler of IGN gave the episode a \\"good\\" 7.5 out of 10 and wrote, \\"Carter and Fusco were integral in Reese's scramble to find Finch, but I'm glad the team still has to go one more episode without Finch so that they have an opportunity to act more like a stable, crime-fighting unit. Plus, we now have the addition of the Dutch-obeying attack dog, Bear! It's Season 2 and Person of Interest has already gone for the cute, sassy mutt. To be fair, Bear can tear your face off. And Reese seems to like him far better than any human being he's encountered so far.\\" Phil Dyess-Nugent of The A.V. Club gave the episode a \\"B+\\" grade and wrote, \\"Person Of Interest started out with a promising sci-fi premise, a couple of intriguingly mismatched lead actors, and a New York skyline wreathed in post-Sept. 11 paranoia. And for at least the first half of its first season, it seemed pretty much content to stand on those elements. The show has developed very slowly, having faith that viewers would be captivated by Michael Emerson doing his mysterioso act and Jim Caviezel supplying the beatdown of the week, while it set its tent posts down, good and solid.\\" Keysha Couzens of TV Overmind wrote \\"Harold Finch is momentarily out of the picture but that doesn‚Äôt mean that Reese, Carter, and Fusco get a day off as we find out in 'The Contingency' that the Machine is still capable of performing its primary function even without the presence of its maker. Meanwhile, Finch is off on a non dragged around by deadly computer hacker Root (Amy Acker) as he pays a price yet again for creating the Machine in the first place. Can Reese and the two detectives track down Harold Finch and keep the latest POI out of harm‚Äôs way?\\" Luke Gelineau of TV Equals wrote \\"The machine does end up finding out who Root was when she was a little girl, but that's about as far as we got. I was genuinely surprised that Finch wasn't found by the end of the episode, but it looks like he‚Äôll be freed by next week so we can get back to the good ol' fashioned Person of Interest episodes.\\" Sean McKenna of TV Fanatic gave the episode a 4.3-star rating out of 5 and wrote \\"Truthfully, there is so much to explore and so many places to go that this episode already has me prepped and ready for what's next.

The finals were contested in a two-legged home-and-away format between Argentine clubs Boca Juniors and River Plate, making it the first Supercl√°sico final of an international competition. The first leg was hosted by Boca Juniors at the Estadio Alberto J. Armando in Buenos Aires, Argentina, on 11 November 2018, while the second leg took place outside South America at the Santiago Bernab√©u in Madrid, Spain (a neutral venue) on 9 December 2018. This was the last final to take place over two legs, as starting from 2019 the final would be played as a single match at a venue chosen in advance. The second leg was originally to be hosted by River Plate at the Estadio Monumental Antonio Vespucio Liberti in Buenos Aires, Argentina, on 24 November 2018. However, due to safety concerns resulting from the attack on the bus of Boca Juniors prior to the match, the second leg was moved outside of Argentina and South America, later confirmed to be the Santiago Bernab√©u in Madrid, Spain. This was the first time that the second leg of the Copa Libertadores final has been held outside of South America, and the first final held outside of the Americas. River Plate won the final 5‚Äì3 on aggregate for their fourth Copa Libertadores title. As winners, they qualified as the CONMEBOL representative at the 2018 FIFA Club World Cup in the United Arab Emirates, entering in the semi-finals. They also earned the right to play against the winners of the 2018 Copa Sudamericana in the 2019 Recopa Sudamericana. River Plate also automatically qualified for the group stage of the 2019 Copa Libertadores. Due to the intense rivalry between Boca and River, the match was referred to as the \\"Superfinal\\", and \\"the Final to end all Finals\\". The press called it the \\"most important final in Argentina's football history\\". According to Richard Martin, a Reuters reporter, River's win \\"guarantees them bragging rights over their neighbours for many years to come\\". ==Teams== {  - !Team !Previous finals appearances (bold indicates winners) -  Boca Juniors 10 (1963, 1977, 1978, 1979, 2000, 2001, 2003, 2004, 2007, 2012) -  River Plate 5 (1966, 1976, 1986, 1996, 2015) } For the third time, two teams from the same country faced each other in the final, after Brazilian teams met in the 2005 and 2006 finals. It was the first all-Argentine final of the Copa Libertadores, as well as the first final to feature two teams from the same city. The 2018 finals marked the first time that the Supercl√°sico was contested in the Copa Libertadores final (or any final of an international competition), and the third time that the two clubs have met in a final, after the 1976 Nacional championship final and the 2017 Supercopa Argentina. Their most recent meeting in the Copa Libertadores had been in the 2015 round of 16, where Boca Juniors were disqualified and the tie awarded to River Plate, after River Plate players were attacked in la Bombonera stadium with pepper spray by Boca Juniors fans when the squad returned to the field following halftime of the second leg, when River were leading on aggregate 1‚Äì0. ==Venues== { The Estadio Alberto J.

If the aggregate score was still tied after extra time, a penalty shoot-out would have been used to determine the winner. If extra time was played, a fourth substitution would have been allowed. ==MatchesFirst leg=== Summary The first leg of the final was originally scheduled for 7 November, with the second leg on 28 November 2018 (both on Wednesdays). However, after the finalists were known, CONMEBOL adjusted the dates, with the first leg (hosted by Boca Juniors, the lower seed) on 10 November and the second leg (hosted by River Plate, the higher seed) on 24 November (both Saturdays at 16:00 local time). The Argentine Football Association opposed the date change. Following discussion, the final was moved to 17:00 local time. The first leg was postponed less than two hours before kickoff due to Boca Junior's pitch at the Estadio Alberto J. Armando being waterlogged due to local flooding. The match was rescheduled for the following day, 11 November, with the kickoff moved to 16:00 local time. The game was goalless until the 34th minute mark, when Ram√≥n √Åbila put Boca ahead, only for Lucas Pratto to equalise 90 seconds later. Dario Benedetto then restored Boca's lead, to make the score 2‚Äì1 at half-time. However, the game was to end all square at 2‚Äì2 after Carlos Izquierdoz scored an own goal for River plate in the 61st minute.

Prior to the second leg of the final on 24 November, the Boca Juniors team bus was attacked en route to River Plate's stadium, the Estadio Monumental Antonio Vespucio Liberti. Multiple windows on the bus were broken after being hit by projectiles thrown from a crowd surrounding the bus, allowing pepper spray to enter the bus. Multiple players on the bus were injured as a result of the broken glass and pepper spray, with the match delayed by one hour to 18:00 local time. Kickoff was later moved to 18:20 local time, and again to 19:15, before once more being delayed until 19:30. Following the delays, the match was rescheduled for the following day, 25 November, with the same kickoff, 17:00 local time. Former Boca Juniors and River Plate striker Gabriel Batistuta called the attacks \\"shameful\\". On 25 November, prior to the rescheduled second leg, Boca Juniors requested that the match be postponed in order for it to be played under equal conditions, which was not met following the attack. CONMEBOL postponed the match once more as equal conditions were not guaranteed. On 27 November, CONMEBOL confirmed the second leg would be played outside Argentina due to safety concerns, with the match taking place on 8 or 9 December. Subsequently, on 29 November, CONMEBOL confirmed the match would take place at the Santiago Bernab√©u in Madrid, Spain, on 9 December at 20:30 local time. For security reasons, prior to the first leg, both clubs unanimously agreed to prohibit away fans from attending either match. However, following the decision by CONMEBOL to move the second leg to Madrid, these plans were altered, with 5,000 tickets allocated to each club. Additionally, River Plate were reprimanded for the bus attack, fined $400,000, and ordered to play two games behind closed doors in the Estadio Monumental. Real Madrid sold 25,000 tickets to fans of each team, as over 250,000 Argentines live and work in Spain, as among those Argentines include Real Madrid manager Santiago Solari, a former River Plate midfielder. Real also agreed to sell tickets to their season ticket holders, which sold out quickly. Security responsibilities for the second leg have been delegated to the Spanish football federation, rather than CONMEBOL, with Prime Minister Pedro S√°nchez claiming that plans are already underway to have the \\"necessary deployments to ensure the event is secure\\". However, additional concerns were reputedly raised by both clubs following the decision to move the game to Madrid. Leonardo Ponzio, the River Plate captain, was allegedly involved in a match-fixing scandal during his time at Real Zaragoza, and as such his eligibility to play football in Spain was unclear at the time. Meanwhile, there are also reports that Boca Juniors intend to appeal the decision to relocate the second leg. In a subsequent press release, River Plate also announced an intent to protest the CONMEBOL decision to play in Madrid. Boca Juniors appealed to the Court of Arbitration for Sport to have the second leg postponed, but was rejected, although the court would continue to consider whether River should be suspended. Summary The second leg finally went ahead in front of a crowd of approximately 72,000 in the Bernab√©u. Most of the early opportunities fell to Boca, and finally Dario Benedetto, who had also scored in the first leg, scored in the 44th minute to give Boca a half-time lead. In the second half, River Plate fought back and finally equalised after another first-leg scorer, Lucas Pratto, scored in the 68th minute. The match then went to extra time, during which Boca were reduced to 10 men after Wilmar Barrios was sent off. River Plate took advantage, with Juan Quintero putting them into the lead in the 109th minute. An injury to Fernando Gago in the 116th minute, left Boca to just 9 men having used all substitutions. In the final minute Leonardo Jara hit the post for Boca, only for River Plate to break upfield and make the final score 3‚Äì1, with an empty net goal from Pity Mart√≠nez. \\"It's been almost 60 days since this started and there is tremendous sadness,\\" said the Boca manager, Guillermo Barros Schelotto.

Baiyun Temple was originally built in the Tang dynasty (618-907), but because of war and natural disasters and wars has been rebuilt numerous times since then. The present version was completed in 2005. ==History== Baiyun Temple was first established in the Tang dynasty (618-907) by a Buddhism believer from Taiyuan, Shanxi. According to the earliest literature records, \\"Jinding Temple in Mount Jiuhua in the southern China, and Baiyun Temple in Mount Wutai in northern China\\". In the Song dynasty (960-1279), Chan master Daofeng () served as abbot of Baiyun Temple, Bishan Temple, Jindeng Temple and Lianjin Temple. The temple had reached unprecedented heyday in that time. In the reign of the Kangxi Emperor (1654-1722), he worshiped Baiyun Temple and wrote a poem Baiyun Temple.

Screen sports is expanding its application range by combining IT with the simulation industry. Virtual reality (VR) technology has developed dramatically and 'screen sports' has gained popularity, and people's hobbies are also changing. The advantage is that you can enjoy sports without restriction of space, equipment, seasons and weather. Screen sports gained significant popularity in South Korea. Screen golf is the most popular type of screen sport, available in numerous venues, but other activities are available as well, from skiing, fishing, climbing, tennis to horseback riding. Screen sport experience can include virtual reality elements. == Emergence == South Korea was one of the first places where screen sports gained popularity. The first screen sport in Korea was golf. Screen Golf is the starting point for the machines brought in for practice in the US in the 1990s. In 1992, \\"Kaywon Trading Company\\" held the 'Party Golf Tournament', which is the first in Korea to enjoy indoor golf. In addition, in the same year, April 10 to 11 in the United States in Utah, South Korea, the Korean national delegation, Hong Dong-Hwan won 118 points and won the third place. == Status == In 2013, Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism sponsored the 'Sports Industry Mid- to Long-term Development Plan' based on the contents of expanding the industrial scale by combining cutting-edge IT and science technology with domestic sports industry for the next five years until 2018. At this time, the IT industry and science technology were combined with the sports industry, and the screen sports market spread to Korea. Currently, the most representative screen sport is the one with the market size of 1.77 trillion won as of 2015. There are over 8000 screen golf courses nationwide. The screen golf business in Korea has been attracting attention not only in Korea but also in the resorts of the world and the wealthy people of the Middle East. According to the Korea Golf Association, the number of golfers who play golf on a screen golf course at least once a year is about 6.2 million. Major users have also expanded from the middle-aged to the younger ones in their 20s and 30s, becoming a living sport. By 2016, the total number of strokes has exceeded 30,000, and more than 55 million golfers annually enjoy screen golf. The main sporting event for screen sports in Korea is golf, which is a baseball game with 7 million spectators in 2015. Computer simulation allows us to enjoy the realism of the actual baseball game. In 2014, the screen baseball industry is showing steep growth. The number of companies has increased from one to 20 in three years. The number of stores that were only three places increased to 350 in the nation. Recently, the number of job seekers who are looking for a screen baseball field rather than a drinking place is increasing because of being spotlighted as a restaurant place for Korean workers. == Type  Screen archery === Pull the actual archery bow to the screen with the same rules as the existing archery to match the target on the screen. Unlike the actual arch bow, the arrow has a hydraulic cylinder. When you shoot an arrow at a target, the arrow moves slowly through the hydraulic cylinder and moves only to the outside of the bow without reaching the target. It can measure the exact score by analyzing the slope and tension of the bow accurately, although it is not put in the bull's-eye where the score line is drawn. Measuring the tension at the time of pulling and releasing the current, measuring the launching speed of the bow, calculating the position of the flying trajectory and the position using the infrared ray beam attached to the infrared sensor row of the screen and the bow. === Screen baseball === Screen Baseball It is baseball that has attracted the attention of fans after golf. Based on the solid offline infrastructure of 20,000 baseball clubs and 7 million spectators of professional baseball, it has become so popular that over a hundred screen baseball courts all over the country have emerged within two years of launch. The secret of popularity is the 'realism' which is very similar to the actual game. Just like a baseball stadium, people have to actually hit the ball at a speed of about 100 kilometers per hour on a mound of 18 meters. Thanks to sophisticated ball catching technology, it accurately distinguishes whether the ball hit by the batter is a foul, hitting, grounding, or home run. The laser sensor is equipped with ultra precision technology that detects up to one millionth of a second, It accurately identifies the strike. Participants such as family members, lovers, and relatives are allowed to decide as they can, and the game can be divided into three, six, and nine innings. It takes about an hour to complete the game before 9 innings, and the fee is less than 50,000 won. As the word of mouth spreads, it is becoming popular enough to be similar to the early days of screen golf. === Screen bowling === It also developed a sensing technology (algorithm) and applied a lift system that is suitable for rain. Due to this, it has made the most sense of bowling possible. When a user enters a rail, a computer graphic appears on the front screen with a bowling rail and a bowling pin. As soon as a bowling ball is released from the hand, a bowling ball appears on the screen and analyzes the movement of the ball with a sensor to determine a strike. It is an attractive sport for people of all ages to enjoy together. Screen bowling plans to develop more service programs in the future. === Screen fishing === One of the most popular hobbies is fishing. People can easily enjoy fishing in the city center without having to go to the sea with expensive fishing equipment. VR technology has created the world's first screen fishing area, 'fishing Joy'. The Tongyeong Yokzi Island and Mara-do offshore, which were photographed by drone, were realistically realized on the screen and sounded like they were on a sea fishing spot by putting sound on the screen, making it popular for fishing-like guests. === Screen golf === Screen Golf At the beginning of screen golf, there was a lot of concern about the popularity of the game. However, it showed explosive growth at the same time. In addition, the domestic screen golf market has grown steadily, exceeding 140 billion won in 2015. In terms of market size, the total number of screen golf strokes exceeded 30,000 by 2016, and more than 55 million golfers a year enjoy screen golf. According to the Korea Golf Census, published by Screen Golf Golfzon and research firm Macromill Embrain, it is estimated that the number of screen golfers in 2018 will be 3.51 million. With the continuous spread of screen golf, the golf population has been growing at a relatively low level of household income. Golfers with an average monthly household income of 3 million won accounted for 16.8 percent, up 4.4 percentage points from the previous survey, and golfers with 2 million won increased by 1.7 percentage points to 8.5 percent. 29% of all golfers are less than 4 million won in household income. On the other hand, household income of more than 6 million won and golfers of 4 million won decreased by 4 percentage points respectively. === Screen shooting === Screen shooting ranges with VR technology are seen as an alternative to the beauty of shooting in Korea, where gun and ammunition are strictly managed. The design of guns in the area is a type of air rifle that is almost identical to the actual model. It weighs about the same and can feel a sense of gunfire similar to actual reactions through the air injection method. If you pull the trigger, the laser will set the target on the screen. It is the same way as a game in a game room. The method can choose between hunting and shooting. If you want to hunt, you can choose different maps depending on the level of difficulty. Shooting can also be selected from the genre of target shot and clay shot. People find the fun of shooting from stressful shots and the sense of achievement they feel when they hit a target. === Screen soccer === Screen Soccer The screen soccer does not have such a burden because it confronts the designated opponent one to one. In the game mode, when you put a soccer ball on a designated mark, you will get a count of kicking the ball. If the player makes a strong effort toward the goal in the screen, the success or failure of the shoot is displayed. Soccer ball speed, success rate, score, rankings (ranking) data, such as data can be counted on the screen can be measured. It is possible not only to attack but also to defend. The defender sets the goalkeeper's movements on the outside machine. Then, the opponent predicts the direction in which the ball is kicked and sets the direction so that the goalkeeper can move. The game progresses with alternating defense and offense, and the person who puts more goals in the set number of times wins. Although it is a screen-based game, you can enjoy the sporting game as if you are playing in a real stadium. === Others === The three winter sports sleighs (luge, skeleton, and bobsleigh), which were not popular, are likely to come out as screen sleds. Already, a device has been developed that doubles the fun and effects of exercise through sensor stimulation of an exercise jacket that is applied directly to the body. Imagine a single capsule with a simulation course inserted. It is established and feels the intensity of exercise throughout the body. Experience-type equipment that requires significant speed, weight and balance can be a combination of games and fitness products. == Outlook == As screen sports become popular as entertainment, it is predicted that a screen sports competition will take place. A South Korean screen baseball game company, \\"Baseball Kingdom together (Îã§Ìï®Íªò ÏïºÍµ¨Ïôï)\\" has signed an agreement with the Korea Professional Baseball Players Association. In January 2018, the company held a screen baseball competition for Korean professional baseball players and the public. ==References== Category:Virtual reality games Category:Sports video games Category:Indoor sports Category:South Korean society ","title":"Screen sports"},{"id":"56070301","text":"The Golden Hind is a named passenger train operating between London Paddington and in the United Kingdom. ==History== The Golden Hind was introduced by British Rail on 15 June 1964.

The Tunkin Depression itself is a tectonic depression, part of the Baikal Rift Zone, between Lake Baikal and Kh√∂vsg√∂l Nuur. The depression consists of a number of basins and is covered by alluvial sediments of the Irkut River. The basin is bordered by the Tunka Range to the north and by the Khamar-Daban mountains to the south. The history of the Baikal Rift begins in the Mesozoic, when intracontinental extension took place at the rift. In the Cenozoic, rifting proper commenced generating basins that were filled by sediments and basaltic volcanism. The causes of the rifting are unclear and may involve either tectonic effects of the India-Asia collision, mantle plumes and asthenospheric processes. The volcanic field consists of numerous cinder cones and lava flows west of the western tip of Lake Baikal. The largest number of individual volcanoes is found close to the town of Tunka and is named the Khobok group. The highest of these volcanoes is Khara-Boldok or Ulyborskiy, which is high. This cone further features a wide crater. Four other groups of volcanoes are found in the Tunkin Depression. The Tunkin volcanic field has filled the Tunkin Depression with about of volcanic products, which range from Miocene to Quaternary and include basaltic lava flows and tuffs. Subsidence is still occurring, and the volcanic cones are consequently lowering; one of the cones now rises only about above terrain. The field has produced basalt, which in this field contains carbonatite, olivine or palagonite. The basalts range from alkali basalts to tholeiites. Volcanism may have protracted through the Pleistocene and Holocene; potassium-argon dating of some cones has yielded several ages, including 1.58 ¬± 0.14 million years ago and 700,000 ¬± 400,000 years before present. == References == Category:Volcanoes of Russia Category:Pleistocene volcanoes ","title":"Tunkin Depression"},{"id":"56070420","text":"Ecuador made its winter games debut at the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea, from 9 to 25 February 2018.

It is the local version of SportsCenter following TV5's partnership with global sports network ESPN after a few years ESPN in the Philippines was hiatus for 5 years after being replaced by Fox Sports Asia (SportsCenter Asia has been relaunched as Fox Sports Central Asia since 2013). It airs every Wednesday & Friday at 9:30 PM and Saturdays & Sundays at 9:00 PM. ==History== Before the creation of SportsCenter Philippines, Sports5 had produced several editions of its own sports news show, mostly airs as a halftime show of its flagship broadcast property, the PBA. ===AKTV Center=== It was first known as AKTV Center, when TV5 airs its sports programs through AKTV block on IBC-13. It began airing on October 2, 2011, and serves as pre- game, halftime, and post-game show of the PBA games which began airing on AKTV on the same day. It was hosted by Patricia Bermudez-Hizon, with Mico Halili and Magoo Marjon as alternates. The format similar to Inside the NBA was adopted for the AKTV Center starting the 2011-12 Philippine Cup Quarterfinal round, usually having a three-man panel consisting of either Halili, Marjon, Bermudez-Hizon, Aaron Atayde and Dominic Uy. Special guests were added at the panel from time to time. Several characters were introduced for the segment, which also includes parodies of NBA players, namely \\"Kobesaya\\" (a look-alike of Kobe Bryant), \\"Jeremy Lin-ta\\" (Jeremy Lin) and \\"J.R. \\"Pepe\\" Smith\\" (J.R. Smith). AKTV Center airs from the IBC studios in Broadcast City but sometimes air from the playing venue during special occasions, notably the league's opening ceremonies and the jersey retirement of Robert Jaworski. During the 2012 Commissioner's Cup, AKTV introduced \\"Home Court\\" with Lia Cruz as its host. The segment airs during the halftime break of the second game. However it only lasted for four episodes before returning to AKTV Center's original format. AKTV Center ceased airing by the middle of May 2013, along with AKTV block itself, following the expiration of blocktime agreement between TV5 and IBC-13 by the end of the month. There were no formatted show aired during 2013 PBA Commissioner's Cup Finals when the PBA games was transferred to TV5 and AksyonTV. ===Sports5 Center=== During TV5's airing of the 2013 FIBA Asia Championship from August 1‚Äì11, 2013, a similarly formatted pre-game show was included in the broadcast, which was named Sports5 Center. This incarnation was carried over for the PBA's 2013-14 season, however it was only aired during Sundays. Sports5 Center was replaced by Sports 360 in November 2014. On November 2016, the pre-game show was again renamed as Sports5 Center, retiring the Sports 360 pre-game show. Sports5 Center continued to air after Sports5 was renamed as ESPN5 on October 13, 2017. It ended on the Game 7 of the 2017 PBA Governors' Cup Finals on October 27. With the launch of SportsCenter Philippines, ESPN5 replaced Sports5 Center with PBA Halftime Show to fill-in on PBA halftime breaks. ===Sports 360=== Sports 360 is a sports-oriented show that also served as a pre-game program for the PBA games during the 2014-15 season. It was shown via livestreaming at Sports5.ph, before the start of the PBA's first game during weekdays and on TV5 before the start of the second game during weekends. The show focused on the latest news in the league as well as other sports. It spun off as a separate show starting February 1, 2015, though a short version of the show, Sports 360 Blitz was introduced for the 2015-16 season as pre-game and post-game show of the PBA.

His research focuses on old age as a social phenomenon. He is also an active partner at the Herzog Institute for the Study of Aging and Old Age. He is the author of more than 15 books. Hazan is the editor of the magazine Israeli Sociology and has been the director of the Institute for Social Research at the Horowitz Institute and the Herczeg Institute on Aging at Tel Aviv University. == Biography == Haim Hazan was born in Jerusalem. When he was 10, his parents moved to Givatayim, where he spent his adolescence. He studied for his B.A. in sociology, anthropology and literature and his M.A. in sociology and anthropology, both at Tel Aviv University, during 1967-1972. The subject of his thesis was \\"Revelations of Relative Totality in the Organization of Life in Retirement Homes.\\" He studied for his Ph.D. at University College in London, guided by Professor Michael Gilsenan, during 1973-1976. While writing his doctorate, he was in contact with Mary Douglas, the well-known anthropologist, whose thinking and theories influenced the start of his career. He was appointed as a lecturer at Tel Aviv University in 1976, and appointed Professor in 1994. Since 2008, he has been editor of the magazine Israeli Sociology. He was director of the Institute for Social Research, the Horowitz Institute and the Herczeg Institute on Aging at Tel Aviv University. He was the academic advisor for the Center for Educational Technology's curriculum on aging and old age, and served as chairman of the professional committee at the Israeli Ministry of Education for a curriculum for the Bagrut in social anthropology. == Research == Haim Hazan is an anthropologist who researches old age as a social phenomenon. In his work, he identifies and characterizes the reality in which the elderly live. He uses old age to examine questions such as: in which way do the elderly constitute time and what language do they use to do it; and to examine questions of identity: how do the elderly define themselves? Contrary to common approaches, which determine that the ailments of old age are a result of functional changes which deplete the resources of the elderly individual, Hazan believes in differentiating between functioning and function and between the elderly and old age. The elderly are the product of physiological-biological deterioration, while functions and old age are derivatives of society and culture. There is no \\"natural\\" affinity between the former and the latter, it is only the human environment in which the elderly live that forces that affinity on them and on itself as though it were an inevitability. The differentiation which distinguishes between the two is similar to the differentiation between sex and gender, presenting the world of old age as one that is constructed of two circles, only partially congruent: the culture circle, defining old age in terms of stigma, expulsion and exclusion and the circle of the structured existence of the elders themselves. The interaction between the two circles is one of tension and acceptance. Hazan devotes most of his research to this interface, between culture and old age. He uses ethnographies to show how, regardless of the cultural \\"iron cage\\", the elderly manage to build their own existential enclaves as an alternative to a hostile, alienating society. However, these alternatives are not asylum cities for the oppressed refugees of society, but meaningful settings which include different ways of perceiving and interpreting reality, allowing their residents a meaningful life even after family, community and finance are no longer as they were. === The Limbo People: A Study of the Constitution of the Time Universe among the Aged === This is the title of Haim Hazan's first book, an adaptation of his doctorate paper. It was first published in English in 1980 and translated to Hebrew in 2002. Based on a research of Jews living in an impoverished district of London in their old age, the book is about the experience and conception of time among the elderly. The people in Hazan's research built themselves a cyclic, separate present, while erasing the past and the future. Through general reciprocal interactions, a joint bank of sorts where everyone gives what they can and withdraws according to their needs, the give-and-take relations are canceled out along with the conception of past and present. === A Paradoxical Community: The Emergence of a Social World in an Urban Renewal Setting === This book was published in 1990, investigating Project Renewal and offering a critical analysis of the rhetorical, social, institutional and local usages of the term 'community', which prevent investment in vital channels such as employment and education. Hazan tries to examine the qualities and characterizations of the term 'community', and the main argument in the book is that there is an inverse ratio between the common use of the term 'community' and the social structure of a community which includes social institutions and communal networks ‚Äì the more one rises, the more the other declines, and vice versa. === Managing Change in Old Age: The Control of Meaning in an Institutional Setting === This book was published by New York State University in 1992. It is an ethnographic study of a retirement home in Tel Aviv, which examines the elders' adaptation to the rapid changes which occur in old age. Hazan studied various people, from the atheist Labor movement people to religious Jews who pray at the synagogue every day. He showed that despite the significant difference between them, the subjects devoted effort and imagination to forming a social space that denies the inevitable, stabilizes the present and allows the survival of meaning under conditions of constant existential threat. In his research, he even revealed a picture of Israeli society, where its center is the aging of the \\"founders' generation\\", ageless in its own mind. === Old Age: Construction and Deconstruction === This is a theoretical book, published by Cambridge University Press in 1994, where Hazan defined and summarized his findings from his various field researches. He tries to find out if we can understand old age, or if old age has a uniqueness we cannot know. In his opinion, the attempt to understand old age is prone to failure, and there is no correspondence between the language in which old people speak in their behavioral world to the language used by the academy or society ‚Äì in cultural representation, imagery, myths and stereotypes ‚Äì to speak of \\"the elderly\\". The problems with representation of time, space and meaning, caused by the gap between the two, are used as keys for the existing discourse between old people, without presuming to break into the uniqueness of the experience of aging. === From First Principles: An Experiment in Ageing === This book, published in 1996, is the product of the ethnographic field research Hazan conducted with 500 elderly people in Cambridge, England, who were part of the University of the Third Age. In this organization, elderly people volunteer to teach themselves and share their knowledge with others in their age group. They established a research committee for matters of old age, where they examined the representation of elderly people on television, for instance, but refused to deal with topics related to death, or what they called \\"The Fourth Age\\", meaning, sick, feeble elderly people. In his research, Hazan found that the elderly tend to develop a language of communication which separates the relationships between themselves and their relationships with the non-elderly world. They dismantled the categories of their lives, such as gender and family, in preparation for death, which could suddenly occur. They were not very sick, but healthy and active, and yet they were preparing for death by decomposing their world. They created shared myths of perennial, eternal now, through a discourse which was comprehensible only to them, thus developing a different, adaptive language of temporary, utilitarian relationships necessary for survival. === Stimulated Dreams: Israeli Youth and Virtual Zionism === This book, published in 2001, is about the communicative world of Israeli teenagers: their myths, cultural imagery and the temporal orientations. The main conclusion in the book is that the processes of globalization ‚Äì with its post-modern characteristics ‚Äì which lead Israeli society, actually intensify the local components of national identity. This is because global apparatuses, such as television and the internet, facilitate the rise of collective communities while cultivating and spreading the myths that constitute them. === Knowledge of Old Age: The Subject of Old Age in Socio-Anthropology Studies === A bibliographical guide that offers 12 curriculums for designated student populations, from high school students to potential researchers. All the curriculums offer the same spectrum of topics in various levels of accessibility. === Old Age as a Social Phenomenon === This book, published by The Broadcast University, presents the main points of the sociological- anthropological discourse of old age, as it deconstructs the main issues that constitute it and suggests a different coping method. The basic assumption of this critical approach is the distinction between the cultural constitution of old age and the elderly as human beings, and between what is considered pathological to what is perceived as normal. A comparative examination of the imagery of different stages of life in various societies challenges the universal assumptions regarding old age. There is special emphasis on the bond between death and old age, once the attitude towards both is determined. === The Anthropological Discourse === This book is an expos√© of major trends and themes in social anthropology. Hazan offers an introduction to the main theoretical thrusts in the discipline. In a series of chapters, Hazan tracks down the process through which the key intellectual debates that form the anthropological discourse are developed and oscillate. === Assassination of Yitzhak Rabin === Hazan wrote a series of articles in Hebrew and English about the assassination of Yitzhak Rabin. In one of the articles, he contended that the identity of the killer would eventually become parallel to the identity of the victim; one could not exist without the other and the two identities would establish the Israeli discourse side-by-side. In another article, he wrote that the mourning ceremonies at Rabin Square after Rabin's death had become a pilgrimage site which exposed the three components of the national identity: 1. The global component ‚Äì flowers and candles; 2. The Jewish component; 3. The Zionist component. As such, the (symbolic) body politic of Rabin consolidates these three components. === A Town at Sundown: Aging Nationalism in Jaffa === This book, coauthored by Dr. Daniel Monterescu and published in 2011, is about the connection between nationalism and the stories of Arab and Jewish elderly, a product of an ethnographic research conducted in Jaffa. The main argument in the book is that the more the distress of old age grows, the national plight and devotion to the national discourse lessens, both among Jews and Arabs. A more theoretically elaborate English version of the book is forthcoming under the title: From Identity Politics to Politics of Existence in An Israeli Mixed City. === Against Hybridity: Social Impasses in a Globalizing World === One of the major characteristics of our contemporary culture is a positive, almost banal, view of the transgression and disruption of cultural boundaries. Strangers, migrants, and nomads are celebrated in our postmodern world of hybrids and cyborgs. But we pay a price for this celebration of hybridity: the non-hybrid figures in our societies are ignored, rejected, silenced, or exterminated. This book tells the story of these non-hybrid figures - the antiheroes of our pop culture. The main example of non-hybrids is an otherwise hybridized world is that of deep old age. Hazan shows how we fervently distance ourselves from old age by grading and sequencing it into stages such as the Third Age, the Fourth Age, and so on. Aging bodies are manipulated through anti-aging techniques until it is no longer possible to do it anymore, at which point they become un-transformable and non-marketable objects and hence commercially and socially invisible or masked. Other examples are used to elucidate the same cultural logic of the non-hybrid : pain, the Holocaust, autism, fundamentalism, and corporeal death. On the face of it, these examples may seem to have nothing in common, but they all exemplify the same cultural logic of the non-hybrid and provoke similar reactions of criticism, terror, abhorrence, and moral indignation. This book offers a critique of contemporary western culture by focusing on that which is perceived as its other ‚Äì the non- hybrid in our midst, often rejected, ignored, or silenced and deemed to be in need of globally manageable correction. === The Holocaust and Globalization === During the years 2006-2008, Hazan led a research group about the Holocaust and globalization at the Van Leer Jerusalem Institute. The results of the research were co-edited with Dr. Amos Goldberg in a volume entitled: Marking Evil: Holocaust Memory in the Global Age. == Books == # The Limbo People - A Study of the Constitution of the Time Universe Among The Aged, London, Routledge & Kegan Paul, 1980. # (An updated edition was published in Hebrew in 2003.) # # Old Age as a Social Phenomenon, (Hebrew).

(Chorus) Isa you are my only treasure Must you leave me, so lonely and forsaken? As the roses will miss the sun at dawn, Every moment my heart for you is yearning. Chorus Isa Lei, the purple shadow falling, Sad the morrow will dawn upon my sorrow, Oh forget not, when you‚Äôre far away Precious moments at Suva. Isa my heart was filled with pleasure From the moment I heard your tender heart greeting Mid the sunshine, we spent the hours together, Now so swiftly those happy hours are fleeting. (Chorus) Over the ocean your island home is calling Happy country where roses bloom and splender, Oh if I could but journey there beside you Then forever my heart would sing in rapture.Chords and words, tabs.ultimate-guitar.com (Chorus) } ==Tongan version== { Ise isa, viola lose hina, Fisimoto matala he lilifa, Isa ete nofo 'l he toafa, To'eloto tangi 'l he potulala.

Oh my! those viola white roses, Blooming flowers from yonder, howbeit, I live in a desert, With the aching heart of loneliness, Crying from desolate. Those branches reaches through the waves, Though difficult and laborious thou attempt, But lo! the lovebird (dove) will now depart, Your body's image will be a burden of my heart. Chorus Oh no! Who can endure? The memories of whom I love, She is my perfume and the fragrance of my life, The catalyst for my eternal love. } ==See also== *Music of Fiji *Music of Tonga ==References * Category:Fijian songs Category:Tongan music Category:1916 songs ","title":"Isa Lei"},{"id":"56070996","text":"Placard on the Jubilee Trail, managed by the club, near H√∂hn The Oberwald Hut, managed by the club, in Selters The Westerwald Club () or WWV was founded in 1888 in Selters in the German mountain range of Westerwald and has about 7,000 members in 40 branches. It acts as a local history society for the whole geographical region of the Westerwald. The main club supports and coordinates the activities of its branches and takes responsibility for wider tasks. It is entered in the club register of the Amtsgericht of Montabaur (VR 485). Its branches support the aims of the main club at local level through largely independent initiatives and events. The motto of the Westerwald Club is \\"Hui! W√§ller? - Allemol!\\" This slogan was chosen in a 1913 prize competition from over 60 entries. The winner was local poet and farmer, Adolf Wei√ü (1861‚Äì1938) from Madem√ºhlen. The meaning of the greeting was explained in his poem: Das Hui hat mich der Sturmwind gelehrt, wenn wild er √ºber die Heide f√§hrt, und ‚ÄûW√§ller‚Äú wir ja ‚Äûallemol‚Äú sind, wir trotzen dem Regen, dem Schnee und dem Wind ... The Westerwald Club is a member of the Associations of German Alpine and Hiking Clubs and supports hiking and tourism. The main club offers multi-day walks through the Westerwald, as well as hiking holidays abroad. The branches organise regular walks and excursions. The club waymarks and manages a hiking trail network over 2,300 km long, including the Druidensteig, the Limes Trail and the Westerwald Trail. Many branches maintain their local footpaths. The branches in A√ülar, Herborn and Wetzlar-Niedergirmes also have their own walking hostels, in which hikers may stay overnight at low cost.

Born in Rothwell, West Yorkshire,1851 England Census, Yorkshire, Hunslet Brown worked as a coalminer from the age of ten. He settled in Hunslet, near Leeds, working at Waterloo Colliery near Thorpe Stapleton, but was sacked for his activity on behalf of the West Yorkshire Miners' Association (WYMA). Unable to find work in the mines, he became a greengrocer, and also earned money as a singer at a Methodist New Connexion chapel. In 1863, following wage cuts, the WYMA was re-established, and employed Brown as its secretary and agent. While in this role, he was probably responsible for compiling and publishing the Miners' Hymn Book. When he held union meetings, they were opened and closed with songs from the book. Brown was also active in the Miners' National Association (MNA), and in 1866 it sent him as the full-time organiser for the Derbyshire and Nottinghamshire Miners' Association. In 1867, members of the union at several mines objected to having their hours increased, and went on an unofficial strike. Although Brown initially discouraged this, he made the strike official as it spread to other pits. However, the union was unable to fund strike pay for so many miners, and eventually the strike collapsed, taking with it much of the union's membership. In 1869, Brown was appointed by the MNA as the agent for the new North Staffordshire Miners' Federation. There, he was able to rapidly increase membership, which was more than 12,000 by 1871. Under his leadership, the union affiliated to the Amalgamated Association of Miners (AAM). Drawing on his experiences from previous posts, he always advocated arbitration in disputes rather than strikes, but when a strike occurred, he supported it. Brown was an accomplished public speaker and addressed many large gatherings in his role as a miners agent. By 1874, coal prices had fallen, and Brown received criticism for not taking a cut in his own wages. Some lodges left the federation, but Brown kept the majority of the union together, reorienting it back towards the MNA and strongly criticising the now-disintegrating AAM. In 1875, Brown was elected to the General Council of the Trades Union Congress, but following protests that he belonged to the same trade as another member, he withdrew before the council was constituted. ==References== Category:1820s births Category:1900 deaths Category:English miners Category:English trade unionists Category:People from Hunslet ","title":"William Brown (miner)"},{"id":"56071034","text":"This is the complete list of number-one albums in Finland in 2018 according to the Official Finnish Charts compiled by Musiikkituottajat ‚Äì IFPI Finland.

Its height is 2,822 m which places it among the top ten summits of Pirin. The peak is built up of granite. Malak Polezhan is situated on the Polezhan side-ward ridge of the range between the peaks of Polezhan (2,851 m) to the north-east and Dzhengal (2,730 m) to the south. It is linked with Polezhan via a short and shallow saddle. To the east adjacent to the saddle is situated the Upper Polezhan Lake (2,706 m), the highest glacial lake in Pirin and the second one in Bulgaria, although some authors consider its altitude being 2,710 m which would make it the highest in Bulgaria. South of Malak Polezhan in direction of Dzhengal there are several lowers elevations with distinct shape known and the Obidim Ears. The eastern slopes of Malak Polezhan are very steep, at places vertical, grassy, and with screes of unstable rock material. The north-western slope is a massive scree composed of flagstone typical of the region. Its lowest section reaches the Upper Gazey Lake. To the south-west of the summit there is a small cirque facing the valley of the river Valyavitsa. In western direction there is a short ridge that links Malak Polezhan with the neighbouring summit Gazey (2,761 m). == Citations  References == * * Category:Mountains of Pirin Category:Landforms of Blagoevgrad Province Category:Two-thousanders of Bulgaria ","title":"Malak Polezhan"},{"id":"56071056","text":"The Church of St. Irene is a Greek Orthodox church on the island of Ios, Greece.

The song's run at number one ultimately extended to 50 weeks at the top.alt=A young woman with long blonde hair singing into a microphone Hot Country Songs and Country Airplay are the two main charts that rank the top-performing country music songs in the United States, published by Billboard magazine. Hot Country Songs ranks songs based on digital downloads, streaming, and airplay not only from country stations but from stations of all formats, a methodology introduced in 2012. Country Airplay, which was published for the first time in 2012, is based solely on country radio airplay, a methodology which had previously been used for several decades for Hot Country Songs. In 2018, three different songs topped the Hot Country Songs chart and 32 different songs topped Country Airplay in 52 issues of the magazine. In 2018, the Country Airplay chart began with \\"Like I Loved You\\" by Brett Young holding the top position, while \\"Meant to Be\\" by Bebe Rexha and Florida Georgia Line held the number one spot on Hot Country Songs, continuing a run that had begun on the chart dated December 16, 2017. When \\"Meant to Be\\" spent an eleventh week in the top spot in February, it overtook Taylor Swift's \\"We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together\\" as the longest-running number one song on the chart for a lead female artist. In August, the song spent a 35th consecutive week in the top spot and broke the record previously held by 2017's \\"Body Like a Back Road\\" by Sam Hunt for the most weeks at number one on the chart. \\"Meant to Be\\" ultimately held the top spot on the Hot Country Songs listing until the issue of Billboard dated November 24, 2018, when it was replaced at number one after 50 weeks by \\"Lose It\\" by Kane Brown. This was the second number one for Brown after \\"What Ifs\\", which had coincidentally ended Hunt's then-record run the previous year. The longest-tenured number one single on Country Airplay in 2018 was \\"She Got the Best of Me\\" by Luke Combs, with four weeks spent at the top. Several artists achieved their first career number ones by virtue of topping the Country Airplay chart in 2018. Russell Dickerson had his first number one with \\"Yours\\" on the chart dated January 27, Scotty McCreery with \\"Five More Minutes\\" on the chart dated March 3, Jordan Davis with \\"Singles You Up\\" on the chart dated April 21, Morgan Wallen with \\"Up Down\\" on June 30, and Jimmie Allen with \\"Best Shot\\" on November 24. \\"Best Shot\\" also made Allen the second African-American country artist to reach number one with a debut single, ten years after Darius Rucker topped Hot Country Songs with his first single. In the issue of Billboard dated December 15, Allen's song became the first since 2008 to drop from number one and then regain the top spot on a chart based on country radio airplay. In addition, Maren Morris had her first solo number-one single with \\"I Could Use a Love Song\\" on the chart dated January 20, after having previously topped the chart as a featured artist on Thomas Rhett's \\"Craving You\\" in July 2017, and Chris Stapleton and Bebe Rexha reached the number one spot on Country Airplay for the first time, having previously topped Hot Country Songs. In June, David Lee Murphy had his first chart-topping single for more than 20 years when \\"Everything's Gonna Be Alright\\", a duet with Kenny Chesney, topped the airplay-based chart. Murphy had last achieved a number one with \\"Dust on the Bottle\\" in 1995. ==Chart history== alt=A young man with shoulder-length brown hair and a young man with a blond ponytail wearing a white cowboy hat alt=A young man wearing a dark T-shirt and cap, playing a guitar and singing into a microphone alt=A young man wearing a check shirt and jeans, singing into a microphone { class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text-align: center\\" - !

Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have been identified as speculative bubbles by several laureates of the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences, central bankers, and investors. In 2018, there was a large sell-off of cryptocurrencies. From January to February 2018, the price of bitcoin fell 65 percent. By September 2018, the MVIS CryptoCompare Digital Assets 10 Index had lost 80 percent of its value, making the decline of the cryptocurrency market, in percentage terms, larger than the bursting of the Dot-com bubble in 2002. In November 2018, the total market capitalization for bitcoin fell below $100 billion for the first time since October 2017, and the Bitcoin price fell below $4,000, representing an 80 percent decline from its peak the previous January. From March 8‚Äì12, 2020, the Bitcoin price fell by 30 percent from $8,901 to $6,206 (with it down 22 percent on March 12 alone). As of October 2020, Bitcoin was worth approximately $11,400. ==Bitcoin== Bitcoin price fluctuations in 2011, 2013 and 2017 Bitcoin has been characterized as a speculative bubble by eight winners of the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences: Paul Krugman, Robert J. Shiller, Joseph Stiglitz, Richard Thaler, James Heckman, Thomas Sargent, Angus Deaton, and Oliver Hart; and by central bank officials including Alan Greenspan, Agust√≠n Carstens, V√≠tor Const√¢ncio, and Nout Wellink. The investors Warren Buffett and George Soros have respectively characterized it as a \\"mirage\\" and a \\"bubble\\"; while the business executives Jack Ma and Jamie Dimon have called it a \\"bubble\\" and a \\"fraud\\", respectively. ==Altcoins== Since the release of bitcoin, over 6,000 altcoins (alternative variants of bitcoin, or other cryptocurrencies) have been created. A January 2018 article by CBS cautioned about a cryptocurrency bubble and fraud, citing the case of BitConnect, a British company, which received a cease-and-desist order from the Texas State Securities Board. BitConnect had promised very high monthly returns but hadn't registered with state securities regulators or given their office address. ==Initial coin offerings== Wired noted in 2017 that the bubble in initial coin offerings (ICOs) was about to burst. Some investors bought ICOs in hopes of participating in the financial gains similar to those enjoyed by early bitcoin or Ethereum speculators. Binance has been one of the biggest winners in this boom as it surged to become the largest cryptocurrency trading platform by volume. It lists dozens of digital tokens on its exchange. In June 2018 Ella Zhang of Binance Labs, a division of the cryptocurrency exchange Binance, stated that she was hoping to see the bubble in ICOs collapse. She promised to help \\"fight scams and shit coins\\". == 2018 crash == The 2018 cryptocurrency crash (also known as the Bitcoin crash and the Great crypto crash) is the sell-off of most cryptocurrencies from January 2018. After an unprecedented boom in 2017, the price of bitcoin fell by about 65 percent during the month from 6 January to 6 February 2018. Subsequently, nearly all other cryptocurrencies also peaked from December 2017 through January 2018, and then followed bitcoin. By September 2018, cryptocurrencies collapsed 80% from their peak in January 2018, making the 2018 cryptocurrency crash worse than the Dot-com bubble's 78% collapse. By 26 November, bitcoin also fell by over 80% from its peak, having lost almost one-third of its value in the previous week. ===Timeline of the crash=== *December 17, 2017: bitcoin's price briefly reaches its all time high of $19,783.06. *December 22, 2017, bitcoin fell below $11,000, a fall of 45% from its peak. *January 12, 2018, Amidst rumors that South Korea could be preparing to ban trading in cryptocurrency, the price of bitcoin depreciated by 12 percent. *January 26, 2018, Coincheck, Japan's largest cryptocurrency OTC market, was hacked. 530 million US dollars of the NEM were stolen by the hacker, and the loss was the largest ever by an incident of theft, which caused Coincheck to indefinitely suspend trading. *From 26 January to 6 February, the price of bitcoin halved, and reached 6,000 US dollars. Additional negative news for the cryptocurrency market continued in the first quarter of 2018. The price remained low though the level slightly recovered in the first quarter of 2018. *March 7, 2018, Compromised Binance API keys were used to execute irregular trades. *Late March 2018, Facebook, Google, and Twitter banned advertisements for initial coin offerings (ICO) and token sales. *November 15, 2018, bitcoin's market capitalization fell below $100 billion for the first time since October 2017 and the price of bitcoin fell to $5,500. ==See also== *Cryptocurrency and security ==ReferencesFurther reading== * Category:Economic bubbles Bubble Category:Financial markets ","title":"Cryptocurrency bubble"},{"id":"56071123","text":"Laumann is a surname.

On Monday, 30 December 1957, 17-year-old Anne Noblett disappeared whilst travelling to her home in Marshalls Heath, Hertfordshire. A month later, on 31 January 1958, her fully clothed body was found in woodland near Whitwell. Her remains showed signs of having been refrigerated and the case was dubbed the \\"Deep Freeze Murder\\" by the press. Two thousand people were interviewed, and refrigeration units within a 30-mile radius were investigated but no one to date has been arrested for the murder. ==Disappearance== On Monday, 30 December 1957, Anne Noblett, a student at Watford Technical College, had attended a dance with friends at Lourdes Hall in Harpenden in Hertfordshire. After the dance she said goodbye to friends and caught the 391 Green Line bus to return home to Marshalls Heath near Wheathampstead, where she lived with her parents (Hugh and Ira) and brothers. The last sighting of Noblett was by Shirley Edwards at around six o'clock in the evening when she alighted the bus at the Cherry Trees pub at the bottom of Marshalls Heath Lane, close to home. There was a report, by a local resident, of car rear lights being visible further up the lane at the approximate time of her disappearance. Her parents reported their daughter as missing and police undertook a search with dogs in the area but found nothing. ==Discovery of body== Noblett's body was found on 31 January 1958 by two brothers, Hugh and Brian Symonds, out walking their dog in Rose Grove Woods (known locally as Young‚Äôs Wood) near Horn Hill, Whitwell; approximately seven miles from where she was last seen. Police attended the scene, in scrub 300 yards from the main road, and Noblett's body was found fully clothed and with her spectacles on; her belongings were found close by. It was determined that she had been strangled and most likely suffered a sexual assault. Her body was also found to be frozen solid. ==Investigation== The crime was investigated by Detective Chief Superintendent Robert Elwell of Hertfordshire CID, who was assisted by Detective Superintendent Richard Lewis of New Scotland Yard's Murder Squad. It was determined that Anne had probably been picked up between the bus stop and her home, possibly by someone she knew. The freezing of Noblett's body could not have been a natural occurrence as the temperature in the period between her disappearance and discovery had been quite mild. Officers now considered that Noblett's body had been refrigerated and the press dubbed the killing the \\"Deep Freeze Murder\\". Though Noblett's body had been found fully clothed it was found that she had been stripped and redressed. Buttons on her undergarments had been attached incorrectly. It was determined during Noblett's autopsy that she had died soon after being abducted, as the food she had eaten that day had not been digested. Dr Francis Camps, the Home Office pathologist who carried out the post mortem, determined Noblett's body had probably been put in a refrigeration unit before being transported to the wood where she was found. Police decided that Noblett had been murdered soon after being abducted, and that her body had then been placed in a refrigeration unit. The murderer then transported the frozen body and carried it (there were no signs of dragging) from a vehicle to the wood where it was later found. They determined that the murderer would have been strong to have carried the 11-stone frozen body to where it was placed, and also that the difference in the growth of plants under and beside Noblett's body meant that she was probably placed there up to a fortnight before being discovered. An extensive police search of all refrigeration units within a 30-mile radius of the crime scene yielded nothing. Local farmland, outbuildings and factories were also searched. The motive for the murder appeared to be of a sexual nature. ==Case reviews== Several case reviews have taken place over the decades following the murder; the last in February 2017. Police admit the murderer may well have died in the intervening years. The possibility of discovering the identity of the murder is low due to a lack of DNA evidence in the case, as no physical evidence remains. ==See also== * Child abduction * Child Abuse * Child Sexual Abuse *Unsolved murders in the United Kingdom ==References * ==Cited works and further reading== * Category:1950s murders in the United Kingdom Category:1957 in England Category:1957 murders in Europe Category:December 1957 events Category:Incidents of violence against women Category:Unsolved murders in England ","title":"Murder of Anne Noblett"},{"id":"56071182","text":"Ernest Daltroff, (November 17, 1867, Sainte-C√©cile, Sa√¥ne-et-Loire - February 3, 1941, New York) , was a French perfumer and the founder of Parfums Caron in 1904. == Biography == Ernest L√©on Ren√© Lucien Daltroff was born to an upper middle class family originally from Russia. His mother Ida-Caroline Bing, an elegant lady, used to put a drop of her perfume behind her son's ears before bed as a child. In his youth Ernest Daltroff travelled and then worked in the clothing industry. In 1900, he visited the Exposition Universelle. Shortly after, as he memorised the captivating scents of flowers, fruits and spices and developed an exceptional olfactory memory, without any formal training, he chose to embark on the profession of perfumer. In 1903, with his brother Raoul, he established a workshop in Asni√®res-sur-Seine in the former perfumery \\"Emilia\\", 12 avenue de la Lauzi√®re. Then in 1904, at the age of thirty-seven, he set up his company in premises located in the heart of Paris, at 10 rue de la Paix. Already planning to reach an international market, he partly adopted the name of the small \\"Mercerie Parfumerie Caron\\" at 20 rue Rossini (9th arrondissement of Paris), bought from Madame Anne-Marie Caron on 1 August 1903. He chose \\"Parfums Caron\\", a short name easily remembered and pronounced in several languages while still being associated with France, rather than his own foreign sounding name, in a country still troubled by the Dreyfus affair. In 1906, he met F√©licie Wanpouille, a young milliner who worked on the same rue de la Paix; She introduced him to her clients and became his collaborator and muse. While Daltroff created fragrances, Wanpouille designed bottles and served as an artistic director,Perfume intelligence.co.uk, bottlers : Vanpouille, F√©licie. together they launched great women's perfumes such as Narcisse Noir in 1911, N'aimez Que Moi in 1917. After World War I, in 1918, Ernest Daltroff was invited to attend the Bronx International Exposition of Science, Arts and Industries in New York with his competitor Fran√ßois Coty. He won the prize for the most go ahead company, which opened up the American market for him during the inter-war period.

In France, F√©licie took over the reins of the house until 1962 with Michel Morsetti, a perfumer trained by Daltroff.

Ernest Daltroff is described by Nathalie Chahine as the most subtle perfumer of his time whose work was closest to that of painters and musicians.

One of the first students to study at the Goldsmiths College (Guldsmedeh√∏jskolen) in Copenhagen, she is remembered for her simplistic style, creating chains threaded with stones. After working for the jeweller A. Dragsted, she established her own business in 1962. ==Early life and education== Born in Kirke Hyllinge near Lejre on 1 January 1924, Karen Strand was the daughter of the car dealer Gerhardt Petersen (1898‚Äì1975) and Christine Jensen (1900‚Äì1941). As a result of her mother's poor health, she was raised in her grandparents' home, an inn in Hornsherred. She grew up in a musical environment; her mother sang and her grandfather often arranged singing evenings at the inn. Strand developed an interest in music, arts and crafts. After attending Roskilde Cathedral School, she worked as a maid in the home of the painter Sigurd Swane and his wife Agnete where she met several prominent artists. She then learnt the art of goldsmithing with Andersen & Enig in Roskilde (1941‚Äì46), with the jeweller A Michelsen (1946‚Äì47) and with Just Andersen (1947‚Äì54). When the Goldsmiths College opened in 1951, she became the first female student, studying there until 1953. ==Career== Strand soon became one of Denmark's most accomplished jewellery artists, creating works of high artistic quality. In 1952, she was awarded Det tekniske Selskab's silver medal for young artists, and in 1953 and 1966 she won the first prize in the contest arranged by the Goldsmiths Council (Guldsmedefagets F√¶llesr√•d). In 1954, she embarked on eight years employment with the jewellers A. Dragsted, first working in the shop but later becoming the leading designer and serving as the firm's director. From 1962, she ran her own workshop in Pilestr√¶de in central Copenhagen for the next 12 years where she initially concentrated on gold pieces but later moved to silver with raw stones and pearls. One of her most successful creations was the innovative Serpentinek√¶ede or Serpentine Chain series, in 1964, primarily for bracelets. For many years, Strand also maintained close collaboration with furniture designers, especially in regard to integrating metal components into furniture. This culminated in the exhibition √Üdelt tr√¶ og √¶dle stene (Noble Wood and Noble Stones) where she exhibited both raw and worked stones. After becoming divorced from her first husband, the antique book dealer Henry Gustav B√∏gelund, in 1971, she moved with her new partner Per S√¶b√∂ to S√∏rnes in the north of Norway where she opened a small workshop. In 1973, she returned to Karlslunde in Denmark, moved first to Jersie in 1983 and then to the little village of Hjelm on the island of M√∏n in 1987. In 1992, thanks to her support, the Danish Jewellery Museum (Danmarks Smykkemuseum) was inaugurated in Store Damme. ==Personal life== Karen Strand died in Copenhagen on 10 February 2000. ==References== Category:1924 births Category:2000 deaths Category:People from Lejre Municipality Category:People from M√∏n Category:Danish women in business Category:20th-century Danish metalsmiths Category:Danish goldsmiths Category:Danish women designers ","title":"Karen Strand"},{"id":"56071208","text":"Hindu Monastery of Africa located at Odorkor in Greater Accra Region of Ghana.

He was awarded the Scientific American Innovator Award at the 2015 Google Science Fair for his work on developing a novel diagnosis test for early-onset Alzheimer's disease. The award came with $25,000. In 2017, Nithiyanandam's research on identifying a mechanism to make triple-negative breast cancer more treatable won the Intermediate Science stream at the national Big Bang Fair. Recently, Nithiyanandam was the recipient of the U.K. Junior Water Prize for his project titled \\"A novel, photocatalytic, lead-sequestering bioplastic for sustainable water purification and environmental remediation\\". He represented the U.K. at the international Stockholm Junior Water Prize. In 2017, Nithiyanandam was named as a Rising Star in Science by The Observer and as one of TIME's 30 Most Influential Teens of 2017. Krtin currently attends Stanford University. == Biography == Krtin Nithiyanandam was born in Chennai, India and moved to Britain with his family. Nithiyanandam's interest in the medical sciences started after he suffered from hearing impairment as a child. He studied at Sutton Grammar School. Nithiyanandam has explained his research at TEDxLondon, TEDxGateway, WIRED: Next Generation, and the Royal Society of Medicine, and has advocated for increased student participation in scientific research. Krtin is a member of Stanford University's Class of 2022. == Research  Alzheimer's research === Nithiyanandam's work focused on oligomeric amyloid beta as a biomarker for Alzheimer's disease instead of amyloid beta plaques. Nithiyanandam developed a bispecific antibody composed of two different Fab' fragments: one fragment from an anti-oligomeric amyloid beta IgG molecule and another fragment from an anti-transferrin receptor IgM molecule. Nithiyanandam's bispecific antibody is conjugated to a quantum dot with MRI and fNIR detection capabilities. Nithiyanandam's in vitro studies suggest that the bispecific antibody quantum dot conjugate has little cross- reactivity and could potentially cross the blood-brain barrier. He won the Scientific American Innovator Award at the Google Science Fair for this work. === Cancer research === Nithiyanandam's research sought to develop a novel siRNA mechanism to decrease ID4 expression in aggressive triple-negative breast cancers. Nithiyanandam found that a knockdown in ID4 expression resulted in aggressive triple-negative breast cancers developing primitive oestrogen receptors on their surface, consequently making the cancer susceptible to existing breast-cancer treatments. Moreover, Nithiyanandam found that increasing PTEN expression in several breast cancer cells lines, including MCF-7, resulted in increased chemosensitivity to cisplatin. However, increased PTEN expression in \\"healthy cell line\\" MCF10A resulted in decreased chemosensitivity to cisplatin. He was the winner of the Intermediate stream of the Big Bang Fair for his work. === Bioplastic research === Nithiyanandam developed a novel bioplastic capable of sequestering lead and purifying water through photocatalysis.

The earl and countess had five children: * Major Anthony Ashley-Cooper, Lord Ashley (4 October 1900 ‚Äì 8 March 1947). * Lady Mary Sibell Ashley-Cooper (3 October 1902 ‚Äì 2 August 1936), who married Napier Sturt, 3rd Baron Alington of Crichel. * Lady Dorothea Louise Ashley-Cooper (29 April 1907 ‚Äì 1987), who married to Anthony Head, 1st Viscount Head. * Lady Lettice Mildred Ashley- Cooper (12 February 1911 ‚Äì 1990) Flight Officer W.A.A.F ; European War 1939‚Äì45 (despatches) * Major Hon. Anthony John Percy Hugh Michael Ashley-Cooper (5 October 1915 ‚Äì 1986), who married Julian Petherick and had four daughters. One of the official homes of the earl and countess was Belfast Castle, which had been reconstructed by the earl's father. However, the couple lived on English estate and spent no time in Belfast after the Partition of Ireland. In 1934, they presented the castle to the city of Belfast. The Chapel of the Resurrection, originally intended as a family mausoleum, was presented to the Church of Ireland, and the remainder of the grounds were sold for housing. Photographs of the countess by Bassano Ltd are held by the National Portrait Gallery. ==References== Category:1875 births Category:1957 deaths Category:English countesses Constance Constance ","title":"Constance Ashley-Cooper, Countess of Shaftesbury"},{"id":"56071252","text":"The sixth series of the British children's television series The Dumping Ground began broadcasting on 12 January 2018 on CBBC and ended on 7 December 2018.

This program introduces financial instruments, also known as the European Structural and Investment Funds, which aim to reduce the gap between different regions of the EU and improve their economic wellbeing. Bulgaria is currently in its second Cohesion Policy program period, spanning from 2014 to 2020, with the first starting at its accession and ending in 2013. The European Structural and Investment Funds have had a positive effect on the growth of employment, economic growth, and new infrastructure. In addition, there are many visible results from implemented projects in the field of transport, regional development, environment, and agriculture. == Types of Funding == The European Structural and Investment Funds (ESI Funds) are the European Union's main investment policy tools. Currently they fall under five categories: European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), European Social Fund (ESF), Cohesion Fund (CF), European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development, and the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund (EMFF). During the 2007-2013 Cohesion Policy period, the European Union has allocated more than 346 billion Euros in order to foster economic growth, reduce disparities between different regions, and overall increase the well being of the union. Regions that are less developed are given priority over more developed ones. The policy envisions that develop regions will indirectly benefit from the growth of the underdeveloped regions by things like trade. In addition, during the 2007-2013 period the program has created more than 1 million jobs, which is about 1/3 of all jobs created in the union, as well as funded the construction of more than 4900 km of roads, the upgrade of more than 2400 km of roads. The program also focuses on giving money to save and preserve the environment, with more than 1300 joint projects for managing natural resources, as well as boost culture and tourism, and increase the quality of life in cities. The EU Cohesion policy is realised in three different dimensions, as stated in article 3 of the Treaty on European Union. These three dimensions are economic, social, and territorial cohesion. Each of these, in turn, will affect different EU Policies. === Economic Cohesion === One of the goals of this dimension is to Lower costs to comply with uniform standards and minimum safety requirements, which will benefit the Single market, the Environment policy, the Competition policy, the Common agricultural policy, and the Common transport policy that the EU is trying to achieve. Another goal is to improve the energy efficiency, which will lead to a Common energy policy and better implementation of the Climate change policy. Lastly, this dimension focuses on converging the economic cycle, which will benefit the Eurozone. === Social Cohesion === The main focus of this dimension is to achieve convergence of national social models and to gradually establish a single EU social model. This will lead to improvement of the EU's Social policy, Education policy, Health care policy, Fiscal policy, Eurozone. In addition, a main goal is to bridge the gap between Western and Eastern Europe, which will lead to the Common foreign policy, the Common security and defense policy, the Neighborhood policy, and the Development policy. === Territorial Cohesion === The main focus of this dimension is to lower logistic and transportation costs, to lower investment cost, and to improve internet connection, which will benefit the Single market and will foster growth in tourism. == Cohesion Policy period 2007-2013 in Bulgaria == In the 2007-2013 Cohesion Policy period, Bulgaria has received more that 6.7 billion Euros through seven operational programs: Administrative Capacity, Competitiveness, Environment, Human Resources, Regional Development, Transport, and Technical Assistance. For that period Bulgaria's progress has been steady, with 100% contracting ratio, payment ratio of 95%, and EC contracting ratio of 81% This was the start of the process of cohesion in Bulgaria, which was characterised by increasing pace of absorption and enhancements of monitoring of activity. === Priorities of the program in Bulgaria === One of the priorities of the program has been improving transportation because the infrastructure in Bulgaria is underdeveloped in comparison to other regions, which is creating a gap. Another has been funding research and innovation because Bulgaria has a relatively low rate of innovation, compared to other regions of the EU. In addition, increasing the rate of innovation can also benefit the growth of the economy. Business support has also been a crucial goal in achieving cohesion. More than 67 million Euros have been allocated in developing connectivity and internet services because play a part in all part of the economy. Finally, an important aspect of the cohesion process has been managing environmental and energy projects. Conservation of energy and using green fuel is a goal of the EU, so Bulgaria has had to make changes in order to contribute to it. {  +Distribution of the ERDF and CF 2007-2013 in Bulgaria !Thematic Area !% - Innovation & RTD 4.5 - Entrepreneurship & Enterprise 8.9 - ICT (citizens & business, broadband) 0.8 - Environment 25.4 - Energy 5.4 - Transport 38.8 - Culture & social infrastructure 6.1 - Territorial dimension 3.5 - Technical assistance, capacity building 6.6 } === Impact === The European funds have had a strong positive impact on the short-term and long-term competitiveness of Bulgaria. There has been an estimated 10.5% GDP growth for the period higher than a projected growth without the EU funds. There has also been growth in the competitiveness of Bulgaria in the form of increase of the volume of private investments, with an estimate 38.2% higher than a scenario without EU funds. In addition, there have been more than 1,300 new jobs created, in addition to helping more than 137,000 people to acquire or upgrade their vocational qualification and over 178,000 persons to acquire key competencies. There have been several successful projects including improving educational infrastructure for over 30,000 students and pupils, enabling more than 398,000 m¬≤ of renovated parks, pedestrian areas, bicycle lanes, playgrounds, providing scholarships to 172,000 students, providing social services in a family environment for more than 51,000 persons, modernising 20 cultural facilities, and investing in energy saving measures in public buildings and schools that couldn't have been completed in the period without the EU funds. The unemployment rate has also been reduced by 6.2%. === Successful Projects that have used ESI funding ===  Sofia Tech Park  More than 36 million Euros were allocated in the creation of the South Tech Park in Sofia, the capital city of Bulgaria. The place has created an environment of innovation, with its main focus being the fields of information and communication technologies, life science, and green energy. The goal of Sofia Tech Park is to create a dialogue between academia and business, while also providing grounds for the development of start-ups and innovation, while marketing new technology products and services.  Sofia Metro Extension  Serdica Station, Center, Sofia More than 239 million Euros were allocated for the expansion of Sofia's underground metro system. The project was funded under the Transport Operational programme. The result is a 39 km of metro lines with 34 stops. It has been estimated that the metro system serves more than 50,000 passengers per hour and has significantly decreased the traffic in the capital. The project was completed before the deadline and sufficient funds were saved in the process. The EU will keep funding the program in order to reach its final goal of 56 km of metro lines and 53 stations by 2020.  Reconstruction and Modernisation of Sarafovo Fishing Port  Around 3.5 million Euros were allocated to renovate and modernise Burgas' fishing port. This was done in order to limit illegal fishing activities. By implementing a controlled market, fishermen can sell their produce legally and directly, which also benefits the customer, who can buy fish without going through a reseller. As a result of its modernisation, the port now provides, electricity, water, and internet to each fishing vessel, as well as providing the necessary conditions for storing on-board fish. == Cohesion Policy period 2014-2020 in Bulgaria == For the 2014-2020 cohesion period Bulgaria will manage seven programs with a total budget of more than 7.6 billion Euros. Transport and Environment will receive funds from the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) and the Cohesion Funds, the Innovation & Competitiveness program and the Regional Development program will be funded by the ERDF, European Social Fund (ESF) will allocate funds for the Human Resources Development and the Good Governance program, and the Science and Education program will be funded by both ESF and ERDF. {  -  colspan=\\"2\\" Budget Allocation for the different programs of the EU Cohesion Policy in Euros - ERDF 3.57 Billion - ESF 1.52 Billion - Cohesion Funds 2.28 Billion - European Territorial Cooperation 165.6 million - Youth Employment Initiative 55.2 million } === Priorities and Goals === The EU has put forward a list of goals that Bulgaria has agreed to achieve by the end of 2020 under their partnership agreement, which will be possible with the help of the ESI funds: * R&D; expenditure in relation to GDP is to increase to 1.5% (2020), increasing to 31.10% of the enterprises realized innovation activities; * The share of RES energy in gross final energy consumption to rise to 16% (2020) and the share of energy from renewable sources in transport to reach 10%; * Higher energy efficiency by 25% until 2020; * Employment among the population aged 20 to 64 years - 76% for 2020 (versus 63.5% in 2013): reduced level of unemployed youths aged 15‚Äì29 to 7% in 2020; achieving employment rate among older persons (55‚Äì64 years of age) of 53% in 2020; * Reducing the number of people living in poverty by 260 000 until 2020; * Share of students dropping out of the educational system to decrease to 11% for 2020 (versus 12.5% in 2013); * Share of persons aged 30‚Äì34 with completed higher or equivalent education: 36% for 2020 (versus 29.4% in 2013); * Reduced time for providing administrative services with 50% compared to 2013; === Implementation === In order for the funds allocated under the Cohesion Policy program to be effectively implemented, the EU has set certain preconditions for Bulgaria to receive funds. The purpose of these preconditions is to ensure that the funds received are implemented to their best extent. Examples of such preconditions are implementation of certain European Union legislation or prioritisings projects that in some way or another are strategic to the EU. In addition, to make the process easier, beneficiaries will benefit from reduced administrative burden, digitalised communication with the managing authorities, standardised application and reporting forms, etc., in an attempt to encourage more people to apply for funding and help reach the set goals. == References == __FORCETOC__ Category:Economy of Bulgaria ","title":"European Structural and Investment Funds in Bulgaria"},{"id":"56071367","text":"The Central Military Band of the Ministry of Defense of Kazakhstan is a military music unit made for state ceremonies carried out by the Ministry of Defense of Kazakhstan. == Background == The band performing at Otar Military Base in 2017.

As a two-year-old in 1986 he won three of his five races including the National Stakes and finished second in the Grand Crit√©rium. In the following year he added three more victories including the Strensall Stakes and the Joel Stakes as well as running second in the Hollywood Derby. He failed to reproduce his form when moved to the United States and failed to win a race in his last two seasons on the track. After retiring with a record of six wins from twenty-five starts he had some success as a breeding stallion in Turkey. ==Background== Lockton was a \\"rangy, attractive\\" chestnut horse with a narrow white blaze and a short white sock on his left hind leg bred in England by his owner Alan Gibson. He sent into training with Jeremy Hindley at his Clarehaven Stables in Newmarket. His sire Moorestyle was an outstanding sprinter who was rated the best horse in Europe in 1980. He sired only three crops of foals before dying of a ruptured intestine caused by grass sickness in 1984. Lockton's dam Bridestones, a half-sister to the Doncaster Cup winner Crash Course, was a useful racemare who won three times over middle distances in 1978 and added a fourth success in 1979. As a descendant of the French broodmare Phebe (foaled 1930) she was distantly related to Ibn Bey, Ouija Board and Kingston Town. ==Racing career1986: two-year-old season=== After finishing second in a maiden race over six furlongs on his racecourse debut, Lockton ran unplaced on his next start before recording his first victory in a maiden over seven furlongs at York Racecourse in July. Less than a week after his win at York, the colt followed up in a minor event over the same distance at Newmarket. He was then stepped up in class to contest the Group 3 Solario Stakes at Sandown Park in August and finished third behind Shining Water (a filly) and Sanam, beaten three lengths by the winner. He looked to be a somewhat unlucky loser, having been boxed in on the inside rail and then hampered when attempting to switch to the outside. On 14 September, Lockton was sent to the Curragh in Ireland to contest the National Stakes, a race which had been Group 1 status in 1985. With no previous Group race winners among the nine runners the field appeared to be a substandard one and Lockton was made the 7/2 third choice in the betting behind the Irish filly Flawless Image (sixth in the Phoenix Stakes) and the Ian Balding-trained Morewoods (fourth in the Gimcrack Stakes). Ridden by Michael Hills, Lockton tracked the leaders before moving into second place behind Baba Karam approaching the last quarter mile. The colt produced a sustained run in the closing stages and caught Baba Karam on the line to win by a head with Rock Chanteur three quarters of a length away in third place. Lockton ended his season with a trip to France for the Group 1 Grand Crit√©rium over 1600 metres at Longchamp Racecourse in October and produced one of his best performances, staying on strongly in the straight to finish second of the nine runners behind the Aga Khan's filly Danishkada. At the end of the season Lockton was given a rating of 120 by the independent Timeform organization, making him twelve poinds inferior to Reference Point who was their best two-year-old. He was rated eleven pounds behind the top-rated Reference Point in the official International Classification for 1986. ===1987: three-year-old season=== Lockton began his second season at Thirsk Racecourse in April and won the one mile Classic Trial by a neck from the Barry Hills-trained . In the 2000 Guineas on 2 May he started a 22/1 outsider and came home twelfth of the fourteen runners behind Mystiko. In June he was sent to France and finished sixth to Risk Me in the Grand Prix de Paris over 2000 metres at Longchamp. After a second-place finish to Ascot Knight in the Scottish Derby he recorded his second win of the season in the Listed Strensall Stakes over nine furlongs at York Racecourse in September, beating Shady Heights by one and a half lengths. Later that month he ran second to Most Welcome in the Select Stakes at Goodwood before returning to winning form when beating Free Fact in the Joel Stakes over ten furlongs at Newmarket in October. For his last two races of the season, Lockton was sent to compete in the United States. He finished fifth behind the five-year-old I'm A Banker in the Kelso Handicap at Belmont Park and then ran second to Stately Don in a division of the Hollywood Derby on 22 November. Timeform awarded him a rating of 115 in 1987 and described him as \\"tough, genuine and consistent\\". ===1988 & 1989: four and five-year-old seasons=== For the 1988 season, Lockton was transferred permanently to the United States where he was trained by Angel Penna, Jr and raced in the colours of Blue Goose Stable.

It was the 137th FA Cup final overall and was the showpiece match of English football's primary cup competition, the Football Association Challenge Cup (FA Cup), organised by the Football Association. It was the second successive final for Chelsea following their defeat by Arsenal the previous year. The teams had met twice before in the FA Cup Final, winning one each between them. The first was in 1994, which Manchester United won 4‚Äì0, and most recently in 2007, when Chelsea ‚Äì then managed by the incumbent Manchester United boss Jos√© Mourinho ‚Äì won 1‚Äì0 after extra time. Michael Oliver refereed the match which was notable for being the first FA Cup Final to use the video assistant referee (VAR) system. Prince William, Duke of Cambridge, and President of the Football Association, was absent as he was attending his brother's wedding. The trophy was instead presented by Jackie Wilkins, the widow of former Manchester United and Chelsea player Ray Wilkins, who died in April 2018. The match was played in sunny conditions in front of a Wembley crowd of 87,647. After a relatively even start to the match, on 21 minutes, Chelsea's Eden Hazard was brought down in the Manchester United box and Oliver awarded a penalty. Hazard scored from the spot to make it 1‚Äì0 to Chelsea, a lead they maintained to half time. Manchester United dominated the second half, and saw a 63rd-minute goal from Alexis S√°nchez ruled out for offside after being referred to VAR. The match ended 1‚Äì0 to Chelsea who won the FA Cup for the eighth time. As winners, Chelsea qualified for the group stage of the 2018‚Äì19 UEFA Europa League, although they had qualified for that phase already via their league position. Chelsea also earned the right to play 2017‚Äì18 Premier League champions Manchester City for the 2018 FA Community Shield. ==Route to the finalChelsea=== { class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text- align:center;margin-left:1em;float:right\\" - !scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:25px\\"Round !scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:175px\\"Opposition !scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:70px\\"Score - !scope=row style=\\"text- align:center\\"3rd Replay Norwich City (A) Norwich City (H) 0‚Äì0 1‚Äì1 - !scope=row 4th Newcastle United (H) 3‚Äì0 - !scope=row 5th Hull City (H) 4‚Äì0 - !scope=row QF Leicester City (A) 2‚Äì1 - !scope=row SF Southampton (N) 2‚Äì0 - colspan=\\"3\\"Key: (H) = Home venue; (A) = Away venue; (N) = Neutral venue } Chelsea as a Premier League team entered the FA Cup in the third round, and were drawn against Championship club Norwich City on 7 January at Carrow Road. Chelsea made nine changes to their starting eleven from their previous league match against Arsenal but still dominated the match, which ended goalless. The replay was held 11 days later and was a 1‚Äì1 draw with goals from Michy Batshuayi in the 55th minute and Jamal Lewis in the 90th minute. The match went into extra time, during which Chelsea were reduced to nine men when both Pedro and √Ålvaro Morata were dismissed, each for two yellow cards. With no further goals, the match went to a penalty shootout that Chelsea won 5‚Äì3 after their goalkeeper Willy Caballero saved N√©lson Oliveira's spot kick. The match was also notable for what the BBC reporter Emlyn Begley described as the \\"first video refereeing controversy\\" in English football when, after deliberation with VAR, Willian was booked for diving when he was brought down by Timm Klose in the Norwich penalty area; Alan Shearer described the decision as a \\"shambles\\". In the fourth round, Chelsea met Premier League opposition Newcastle United at Stamford Bridge, and won 3‚Äì0 with two goals from Batshuayi and one from Marcos Alonso. In the fifth round, Chelsea faced Hull City, another Championship team, at home. Chelsea were dominant, scoring four times in the first half with goals from Willian (2), Pedro and Olivier Giroud, winning the game 4‚Äì0. In the quarter-finals, they visited the King Power Stadium to face fellow Premier League opponents Leicester City, where a goal for Chelsea from Morata and a Leicester equaliser from Jamie Vardy took the game to extra time. Substitute Pedro came off the bench and scored the winning goal to take Chelsea to the semi-final. There, they played Premier League opposition in Southampton at Wembley, and goals from strikers Giroud and Morata saw Chelsea win 2‚Äì0, and progress to the FA Cup Final for the second successive season. ===Manchester United=== { class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text- align:center;margin-left:1em;float:right\\" - !scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:25px\\"Round !scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:175px\\"Opposition !scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:70px\\"Score - !scope=row style=\\"text- align:center\\"3rd Derby County (H) 2‚Äì0 - !scope=row style=\\"text- align:center\\"4th Yeovil Town (A) 4‚Äì0 - !scope=row style=\\"text- align:center\\"5th Huddersfield Town (A) 2‚Äì0 - !scope=row style=\\"text- align:center\\"QF Brighton & Hove Albion (H) 2‚Äì0 - !scope=row style=\\"text- align:center\\"SF Tottenham Hotspur (N) 2‚Äì1 - colspan=\\"3\\"Key: (H) = Home venue; (A) = Away venue; (N) = Neutral venue } Like Chelsea, Manchester United entered the cup in the third round because of their Premier League status. They were drawn at home against Championship side Derby County. Despite making five changes to the starting line-up from their previous league match, the Manchester United manager Jos√© Mourinho fielded a strong side, including Juan Mata, Paul Pogba, Marcus Rashford and Henrikh Mkhitaryan. United dominated the game and won 2‚Äì0 with late goals from Jesse Lingard and substitute Romelu Lukaku. Their fourth round opponents were League Two club Yeovil Town, the lowest ranked team remaining in the competition. Mourinho made ten changes for the match, played at Huish Park, which ended in a 4‚Äì0 victory for United with goals from Rashford, Ander Herrera, Lingard and Lukaku. In the fifth round, Manchester United were drawn against fellow Premier League side Huddersfield Town away at Kirklees Stadium. Although Mata had a goal ruled out following a controversial VAR review, Lukaku scored in each half to secure a 2‚Äì0 win. In the quarter-finals, they played Premier League Brighton & Hove Albion at Old Trafford. Lukaku scored in the 37th minute and with Brighton's J√ºrgen Locadia missing four chances to equalise, a late goal from Nemanja Matiƒá, the United midfielder, secured his side 2‚Äì0 victory. In the semi-final at Wembley Stadium, Manchester United faced fellow Premier League club Tottenham Hotspur, who took an early lead through Dele Alli. Alexis S√°nchez equalised midway through the first half with a header from Pogba's cross past the Tottenham goalkeeper Michel Vorm. Herrera then put United ahead in the second half and his team held on for the 2‚Äì1 win and progression to the final. ==MatchBackground=== Ray Wilkins (pictured in 2008), who had played for both Chelsea and Manchester United. The 2018 final was the last match of the 2017‚Äì18 FA Cup and the 137th final of the FA Cup, the world's oldest football cup competition. This was Chelsea's thirteenth FA Cup final, having last progressed to the final the previous season where they lost 2‚Äì1 to Arsenal. Chelsea had won the cup on seven occasions, the most recent being in the 2012 FA Cup Final where they defeated Liverpool 2‚Äì1. Manchester United had featured in nineteen finals prior to 2018: their most recent appearance was in the 2016 final when they needed extra time to beat Crystal Palace 2‚Äì1. The 2018 final was the third to see Manchester United and Chelsea face one another: United won the 1994 FA Cup Final 4‚Äì0 while Chelsea were 1‚Äì0 winners in the 2007 final. In the two meetings between the clubs during the 2017‚Äì18 Premier League, Chelsea won 1‚Äì0 at Stamford Bridge in November 2017 while Manchester United won 2‚Äì1 at Old Trafford the following February. The season ended with Manchester United in second place, and Chelsea fifth, eleven points behind. Tributes for former Chelsea and Manchester United midfielder Ray Wilkins, who died on 4 April, were held before the match on the hoardings and the screens in the stadium, as well as a feature in the matchday programme. Wilkins won the FA Cup with both sides; in the 1983 final for United, and three times as assistant manager of Chelsea ‚Äì in the 2000, 2009 and 2010 finals. The traditional performance of the hymn, \\"Abide with Me\\" was performed by the choir of the Royal Air Force and 14 individual fans of 14 different clubs with a flypast by three Royal Air Force Typhoons. The national anthem, \\"God Save the Queen\\", was sung by soprano Emily Haig who also performed it at the 2018 FA Women's Cup Final. The referee for the match was 33-year-old Michael Oliver from Northumberland. He previously officiated when these two sides met in the previous season's quarter-final, in which he sent off Manchester United's Herrera. Oliver became the youngest FA Cup final referee since the 1914 FA Cup Final between Burnley and Liverpool which was officiated by the 32-year-old Herbert Bamlett. Oliver's assistants were Ian Hussin from Liverpool and Lee Betts from Norfolk. The fourth official was Lee Mason of Lancashire, and the fifth official was Constantine Hatzidakis from Kent. For the first time in the final, there was a VAR, Neil Swarbrick of Lancashire. His assistant was Mick McDonough, also of Northumberland. The ball for the match was an FA Cup-branded variant of the Nike Ordem V, and featured the names of 137 players who had scored goals during the 2017‚Äì18 FA Cup season, in every round from the extra preliminary round through to the semi- finals. Mourinho had made nine changes to his starting line-up for the final Premier League match against Watford the previous weekend. Of that eleven, just three were retained for the FA Cup final: Ashley Young, Rashford and S√°nchez. Lukaku had also recovered from an ankle injury sustained in April to be selected amongst the substitutes. S√°nchez and Giroud became the first players to appear in consecutive FA Cup finals but for different clubs since Brian Talbot accomplished the feat representing Ipswich Town in the 1978 final and Arsenal the following year. The Chelsea manager Antonio Conte made three changes from the team which lost in the league match against Newcastle United 3‚Äì0: Andreas Christensen, Emerson and Ross Barkley were dropped for Antonio R√ºdiger, Alonso and Cesc F√†bregas. Speculation had surrounded Conte's position as Chelsea manager for several months. He confirmed that his future with the club would be clarified after the FA Cup Final. ===First half=== The match, played in sunny conditions in front of a crowd of 87,647, was kicked off by Manchester United just after 5:15p.m. Two minutes into the game, Alonso was fouled by Herrera, but the resulting free kick from F√†bregas went straight to the Manchester United goalkeeper David de Gea. Six minutes later, Lingard was brought down by the Chelsea midfielder N'Golo Kant√© who conceded a free kick. From the set piece, Young's cross was cleared by Gary Cahill but a mistake from Phil Jones allowed Eden Hazard an opportunity: his shot was saved by the outstretched leg of De Gea. In the fourteenth minute, Chelsea's Ti√©mou√© Bakayoko fell in the United penalty area after contact with Matiƒá, but Oliver decided no foul had been made. Two minutes later, S√°nchez also made an unsuccessful claim for a penalty after contact with both Victor Moses and C√©sar Azpilicueta sent him to the ground in the Chelsea box. After 21 minutes, Hazard received a pass from F√†bregas and made a run into Manchester United's box, where he was fouled by Jones with a sliding tackle, who received the first yellow card of the game. Oliver awarded a penalty which Hazard himself took, sending the ball low to the right past United goalkeeper De Gea to make it 1‚Äì0 to Chelsea. It was the first penalty scored outside a shootout in the FA Cup Final since Ruud van Nistelrooy scored for Manchester United in the 2004 final. In the 26th minute, Pogba was fouled, allowing S√°nchez to send a free kick toward Herrera. His misplaced shot ended back with S√°nchez whose cross for Pogba was deflected out by R√ºdiger: the resulting corner came to nothing. Pogba then shot wide of Thibaut Courtois' goal before a S√°nchez strike from went off-target. On 35 minutes, S√°nchez fouled Bakayoko on the edge of the United area, but the resulting free kick from F√†bregas struck the wall and was cleared. Three minutes later, Pogba won a corner from which S√°nchez tried to score directly, but F√†bregas cleared at the near post. Chris Smalling then conceded a corner from another Chelsea free kick: F√†bregas' ball was punched away by De Gea. A minute before half time, Young was fouled by Moses. The free kick resulted in a corner for United, from which Young's cross was headed past Chelsea's right-hand goalpost by Jones. Rashford then missed a chance and the half ended 1‚Äì0 to Chelsea. ===Second half=== The game during the second half No changes to either team were made during half time and Chelsea kicked off the second half. Seven minutes in, Young was fouled by Moses and United were awarded a free kick which was taken by Rashford. Pogba missed his header and Courtois was able to punch the ball clear. Two minutes later, Young received the ball from Herrera but chipped his shot over the Chelsea crossbar. Herrera then sent Antonio Valencia clear in the Chelsea box: he chose to pass to Rashford whose strike was cleared by Courtois, before Pogba's attempt was gathered by the goalkeeper. In the 57th minute, a corner from Pogba was cleared, and Hazard's quick break was ended by a Valencia foul for which he received the second booking of the game. Matiƒá then shot wide of the Chelsea goal before Hazard's strike was saved by De Gea at the other end of the pitch. On 63 minutes, Rashford was brought down, winning a free kick which he took himself, finding Jones in the middle of the Chelsea penalty area. His header to the bottom-right corner was goal-bound but Courtois pushed it away, only for S√°nchez to knee the ball into the net. The goal was subsequently disallowed as S√°nchez was adjudged to have been in an offside position, which was then confirmed by VAR. United continued to dominate the second half but in the 71st minute, Chelsea's Kant√© made a run into the United penalty area and passed to Alonso whose shot was parried by De Gea. Moses attempted to take the rebound past Young, but the ball deflected off the United player's arm. Appeals for a penalty were turned down with VAR making the decision. In the 73rd minute, Rashford was sent clear by Lingard, but his shot was saved by Courtois. United then made the first substitutions of the afternoon, with Lingard and Rashford being replaced by Anthony Martial and Lukaku. Two minutes later, a shot from Martial was deflected and caught by Courtois before a clash of heads between Giroud and Jones meant the United defender had to leave the pitch for medical attention. With ten minutes remaining, a strike from Matiƒá was pushed away by the United goalkeeper for a corner, from which Azpilicueta's deflected shot was caught by De Gea. Pogba then sent a header wide of the Chelsea goal before S√°nchez's shot from went just wide of the post. With three minutes of the match left, Mata came on for Jones before Martial's lofted shot went high over the goal. In the 89th minute Chelsea made their first substitution with Morata coming on for Giroud, and shortly after, Hazard was replaced by Willian. Five minutes of additional time were indicated, and three minutes in, Courtois was booked for time-wasting. Despite late chances for both sides, no further goals were scored and the match ended 1‚Äì0 to Chelsea. ===Details=== { width=92% -   } { style=\\"width:100%\\" - style=\\"vertical-align:top;width:40%\\" { style=\\"font- size:90%\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"0\\" - !width=25 !!width=25 - GK 13 Thibaut Courtois  - CB 28 C√©sar Azpilicueta - CB 24 Gary Cahill (c) - CB 2  Antonio R√ºdiger - RM 15 Victor Moses - CM 14 Ti√©mou√© Bakayoko - CM 7  N'Golo Kant√© - CM 4  Cesc F√†bregas - LM 3  Marcos Alonso - CF 10 Eden Hazard   - CF 18 Olivier Giroud   - colspan=4Substitutes: - GK 1  Willy Caballero - DF 21 Davide Zappacosta - DF 50 Trevoh Chalobah - MF 8  Ross Barkley - MF 11 Pedro - MF 22 Willian   - FW 9  √Ålvaro Morata   - colspan=4Manager: - colspan=\\"4\\" Antonio Conte } style=\\"vertical-align:top\\"300px style=\\"vertical-align:top;width:50%\\" { cellspacing=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"0\\" style=\\"font-size:90%;margin:auto\\" - !width=25 !!width=25 - GK 1  David de Gea - RB 25 Antonio Valencia (c)  - CB 12 Chris Smalling - CB 4  Phil Jones   - LB 18 Ashley Young - CM 21 Ander Herrera - CM 31 Nemanja Matiƒá - CM 6  Paul Pogba - RF 14 Jesse Lingard   - CF 19 Marcus Rashford   - LF 7  Alexis S√°nchez - colspan=4Substitutes: - GK 20 Sergio Romero - DF 3  Eric Bailly - DF 36 Matteo Darmian - MF 8  Juan Mata   - MF 39 Scott McTominay - FW 9  Romelu Lukaku   - FW 11 Anthony Martial   - colspan=4Manager: - colspan=\\"4\\" Jos√© Mourinho } } { style=\\"width:100%;font-size:90%\\" style=\\"width:40%;vertical-align:top\\" Man of the Match: Antonio R√ºdiger (Chelsea) Assistant referees: Ian Hussin (Liverpool) Lee Betts (Norfolk) Fourth official: Lee Mason (Lancashire) Fifth official: Constantine Hatzidakis (Kent) Video assistant referee: Neil Swarbrick (Lancashire) Assistant video assistant referee: Mick McDonough (Northumberland) style=\\"width:60%;vertical-align:top\\" Match rules *90 minutes *30 minutes of extra time if necessary *Penalty shoot-out if scores still level *Seven named substitutes *Maximum of three substitutions, with a fourth allowed in extra time } ===Statistics=== { class=\\" plainrowheaders\\"  - +Statistics - !scope=col width=100 !scope=col width=70Chelsea !scope=col width=70Manchester United - !scope=rowTotal shots 6 18 - !scope=rowShots on target 3 5 - !scope=rowCorner kicks 5 9 - !scope=rowFouls committed 11 13 - !scope=rowPossession 33% 67% - !scope=rowYellow cards 1 2 - !scope=rowRed cards 0 0 } ==Post-match== As President of The Football Association, Prince William, Duke of Cambridge would normally have attended the final and presented the trophy to the winning captain at the conclusion of the game. However, as the final was scheduled for the same day as his brother's wedding, for which he was serving as best man, the trophy was instead presented by Jackie Wilkins, the widow of former Manchester United and Chelsea player Ray Wilkins, who died in April 2018. Chelsea's R√ºdiger was named man of the match. Cahill, the winning captain, said \\"We had a lot of defending to do... This is a dream come true, as this is the first one as captain\\". Hazard added: \\"We tried to defend well. We scored one goal, it's enough today.\\" Conte was upbeat: \\"I'm very satisfied because today was very difficult... It showed great desire to finish the season in the right way despite the great difficulty we have had\\". Mourinho was indignant in defeat: \\"I congratulate them because they won, but I don‚Äôt think they deserve to win. I congratulate because I am a sportsman.\\" He also opined: \\"Every defeat hurts, but for me personally the ones that hurt less are when you give everything and you go without any regrets\\". BBC Sport correspondent Phil McNulty highlighted the performance of the Chelsea players Hazard, Courtois, Kant√©, Cahill and R√ºdiger, while criticising United trio Jones, S√°nchez and Pogba. Sam Wallace, writing in The Daily Telegraph declared that \\"this was a dreadful final\\". Chelsea won ¬£1.8million for winning the final and became the first club to win the FA Cup, the Women's FA Cup and the FA Youth Cup in the same season. As winners, Chelsea qualified for the group stage of the 2018‚Äì19 UEFA Europa League, although they had qualified for that phase already via their league position. This meant that Arsenal, who finished sixth in the league, gained qualification for the Europa League. Chelsea also earned the right to play 2017‚Äì18 Premier League champions Manchester City for the 2018 FA Community Shield. Chelsea returned to Wembley to contest the 2020 FA Cup Final where they lost 2‚Äì1 to Arsenal. It was the first time that Mourinho had lost a cup final in charge of an English team, after seven consecutive victories, and the defeat sealed his third-ever full season without winning silverware. It was the first domestic cup won by Conte, who lost the 2012 Coppa Italia Final with Juventus and the previous season's FA Cup Final as Chelsea manager. Conte was sacked by Chelsea in July 2018 before becoming the manager of Inter Milan on a three-year deal beginning with the 2019‚Äì20 Serie A season. He was replaced by Maurizio Sarri the following day. Mourinho spent ¬£400million on eleven players after the final, but, that December, with Manchester United 19 points behind the league leaders Liverpool, he was dismissed. ==NotesReferences== Category:FA Cup Finals FA Cup Final Final Fa Cup Final 2018 Fa Cup Final 2018 Category:Events at Wembley Stadium FA Cup Final ","title":"2018 FA Cup Final"},{"id":"56071402","text":"Not to be confused with Fort Hughes (New Brunswick) Fort Hughes, Starr's Point, Nova Scotia Fort Hughes (also known as the Planters Barracks) was a fortification that was built at present-day Starr's Point, Nova Scotia during the American Revolution to protect against raids by American privateers.

It extends along Albany Avenue (United States Route 44) between Garden and Woodland Streets, including side streets to the south, and extends northward to include the southern portion of Keney Park. This area was developed in the first two decades of the 20th century, and has a fine array of period middle-class housing in the Queen Anne and Colonial Revival styles. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1986. ==Description and history== Albany Avenue was laid out in the early 19th century as a turnpike connecting Hartford to Albany, New York. The stretch in the northern part of the city was initially farmland, and it was where a number of wealthy Hartford businessmen, notably James Goodwin and James Goodwin Batterson, built large country estates in the second half of the 19th century. In the 1890s Hartford's streetcar system was extended along Albany Avenue, opening the area to more intensive development. Streets were platted on either side of the road, with many of the house lots sold to individuals who hired builders to put up houses. The houses were of a size and scale designed to appeal to the city's rapidly growing middle class, and had higher quality features than typical worker tenement housing of the period. Keney Park, at the northern end of the district, was established in 1898 by a bequest from businessman Henry Keney, and was one of the attractions whose easy access was promoted by developers. Most of the houses 663 buildings in the district are houses set on relatively narrow lots, and share a significant number of common architectural elements. They are typically of wood frame constructions and 2 to 2-1/2 stories in height. Their exteriors are clad in a combination of wooden clapboards and shingles, the latter sometimes decoratively cut in the Queen Anne style. Porches are another common feature, often with Tuscan columns, as are leaded stained-glass windows and Palladian windows. Commercial development is generally limited to Albany Avenue itself, in some cases as alterations to period houses, and period buildings housing more than two units (triple decker tenements and apartment blocks) are mainly limited to Lenox Street. ==See also== *National Register of Historic Places listings in Hartford, Connecticut ==References== Category:Historic districts on the National Register of Historic Places in Connecticut Category:National Register of Historic Places in Hartford, Connecticut Category:Queen Anne architecture in Connecticut Category:Shingle Style architecture in Connecticut Category:Colonial Revival architecture in Connecticut ","title":"Upper Albany Historic District"},{"id":"56071488","text":"Pandir is an administrative unit, known as Union council of Buner District in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province of Pakistan.

It forms the central part of the natural region of the Gie√üen-Koblenz Lahn Valley between the Weilburg Lahn Valley Region and the Lower Lahn Valley on both sides of the Lahn around the town of Limburg. == Description == Natural regions in the Limburg region (county of Limburg-Weilburg) The Limburg basin, which measures about 20 by 14 kilometres across and is almost treeless, is a tectonic intrusion field (Einbruchsfeld) and connects the more deeply incised valley sections in the Weilburg Lahn Valley area with those of the Lower Lahn Valley. It is divided into the North and South Limburg Basin Hills and the almost level Inner Limburg Basin, including the Villmar Bay and Linter Plateau, in whose bottom the winding course of the course of the Lahn has sunk about 50 metres deep. The hills that rise at the edges of the basin or within it form landmarks that are visible from a long distance away, dominating the landscape. These include the Heidenh√§uschen () north of Steinbach, the Mensfelder Kopf (313.7 m) and the hill ridge of Galgenberg (up to 277.1 m) on the far side of the eastern rim of the basin in the Langhecken Lahn Taunus (in the Eastern Hintertaunus) near Villmar. The bedrock consists mainly of rocks from the geological Lahn Depression, which outcrop at the edges and on the steep slopes of the valleys. Of particular importance here are three beds of Middle Devonian Corallian Limestone (Lahn Marble) which are embedded in the predominantly volcanic rocks (diabase,schalstein) of the Lahn Depression. In the north, the terrain is shaped by the younger volcanism of the Westerwald with individual basalt deposits - the Galgenberg () at Hadamar, the Gro√üer Berg (}) at Ahlbach, the Beselicher Kopf (}) at Obertiefenbach. These are related to tectonic distortions, which pass through the basin in a north-south direction and are recognizable by the Weitungen at Dietkirchen and Limburg as well as by ditch fillings (sand, gravel, clay). The Lahn leaves the basin at the Diezer Pforte and transitions, accompanied by a flight of terraces, into the Lower Lahn Valley near Fachingen. The mineral springs there rise from a tectonic fault line, which forms the western rim of the basin facing the Western Hintertaunus, the line is discernible from the thermal springs of Bad Schwalbach and Schlangenbad running up to the Rheingau. Large areas of the Limburg Basin are covered by thick loess layers, for example, on the Ahlbacher B√∂rdenplatte which is flanked by the Elz-Hadamar Basin Rim with the Elbbach bottom and the Schupbach-Hofen Perimeter Plateau with the valley of the lower Kerkerbach as its boundary. The black earth-like soils, together with the favourable climate of the basin, have resulted in an important old settlement area with intensive corn and root crop farming. In the southern part of the basin, the Kirberg Hills, the local name of \\"Golden County\\" (Goldene Grafschaft) on the Aar and the Goldener Grund along the Emsbach reflects the fertility of the area. Not to be underestimated is the historical importance of the basin for road communications as there is a key crossing over the Lahn at Limburg, used by long-distance trading routes of the early Middle Ages. The A3 motorway and Cologne‚ÄìRhine/Main high speed railway continue this tradition by following a very similar course. == Sources == * Bundesamt f√ºr Naturschutz (BfN): ** Map service ** Landscape fact file (entire major unit group) * Environmental Atlas of Hess (Umweltatlas Hessen): ** Map ** Description (Haupteinheit 311) * Literature: ** Feuerstein, B.: Die Naturr√§ume unseres Landkreises.

Reid and James Hobart Moore, he became known as one of the 'big four' or 'tin plate crowd' in American industry. == Early life == Leeds was born in 1861, to parents Noah Smith Leeds and Hannah Star Leeds in Richmond, Indiana. After receiving an education at public schools, Leeds worked as a florist. In 1883, he married Jeannette Gaar, a relative of Harry Miller, general superintendent of the Pennsylvania Railroad. == Career == In 1883, Leeds joined an engineering corps. Three years later, Leeds was employed by the Cincinnati and Richmond Railroad, where he became division superintendent in 1890. Leeds first went into the tin-plate industry with partners who invested about $250,000, and the company failed. Later, Leeds founded the American Tin Plate Co. in 1898, with his partners Daniel G. Reid, William H. Moore and James H. Moore. The company grew to consist of over 200 companies, and gained control of as much as 90% of the tinplate industry. The company expanded to comprise over 28 mills in Elwood.William McKinley passed a tin tariff, in part to protect their business. They organized the National Steel Corporation in 1899 to provide steel to the tin company, with about $50 million in stock. The company sold for as much as $40 million to U.S. Steel. Leeds was also involved in founding the National Steel Corporation, American Sheet Steel Company and the American Steel Hoop Company He became president of Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad in 1902. In 1904, he was ousted from the company after a disagreement with his partners. Leeds was heavily involved with National Biscuit Company, Diamond Match Company, Tobacco Products Corporation and American Can Company.

He maintained membership in the Meadow Brook club, Automobile Club of America, and The Brook club. The 'Billy Bi' soup was named after him. Leeds was also an avid horseman. ==Pearl necklace== Leeds purchased a pearl necklace for his wife. The necklace cost $360,000 when he bought it, but he only paid the ten percent tariff on pearls, rather than the sixty percent tariff on a pearl necklace. The United States filed suit, and for several years, as the case was litigated, the \\"Leeds pearls were the most famous jewels in America.\\" == Personal life == On August 16, 1883, Leeds married his first wife, Jeanette Irene Gaar, in Wayne, Indiana. She was a relative of Harry Miller, superintendent of Pennsylvania Railroad. On March 15, 1886, their only child, Rudolf Gaar Leeds, was born in Indiana. On August 2, 1900, Leeds married his second wife, Nonie May Stewart-Worthington, whose first husband was George Ely Worthington. On September 19, 1902, their only child, William Bateman Leeds Jr., was born in New York City. On June 23, 1908, Leeds died in Paris, France. Leeds was 46. Leeds is buried in Richmond, Indiana. His second wife, Nonie, went on to marry Prince Christopher of Greece and Denmark, an uncle of Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh. and took the name ‚ÄúAnastasia‚Äù upon joining the Greek Orthodox Church, becoming known as ‚ÄúPrincess Anastasia of Greece and Denmark‚Äù. Nonie and Leeds's son, William Jr., later married one of Prince Christopher's nieces, Princess Xenia Georgievna of Russia. The couple were married in Paris, and lived in Long Island.

It was originally published on December 5, 2017 by Center Street, an imprint of Hachette Book Group. It was co-authored by Corey Lewandowski, Trump's first campaign manager, and David Bossie, the head of Citizens United and Trump's final deputy campaign manager. It is the first book about the Trump campaign to be published by the campaign's insiders. ==Content== Let Trump Be Trump contains numerous anecdotes from the Trump campaign, including accounts that Trump regularly ate fast food and angrily swore at his aides. Some of these anecdotes, including that Trump preferred to eat two Big Macs, two Filet-o- Fish, and a chocolate milkshake from McDonald's, were revealed on December 2, 2017, when the Washington Post published excerpts of an advance copy of the book. In the book, the authors also wrote that \\"Sooner or later, everybody who works for Donald Trump will see a side of him that makes you wonder why you took a job with him in the first place\\". The book also states that Chris Vlasto, the then-executive producer of Good Morning America, called Bossie at 5:01 PM on the night of the 2016 election with early exit polling data. In December 2017, ABC News said that once they learned about the alleged sharing of this data, they asked Vlasto about whether he had done it. The network also said that Vlasto admitted that he had done it, and that they reprimanded him as a result. ==Reviews== Maggie Haberman, writing in the New York Times, described Let Trump Be Trump as \\"...a combination of over-the-top praise for [Lewandowski's and Bossie's] candidate, nostalgic remembrances of glory days and rewarding aides they liked and score-settling with their enemies, particularly Paul Manafort, whose arrival in the campaign started the countdown clock on Mr. Lewandowski's dismissal.\\" She also described the book as \\"a fairly typical campaign memoir\\". David Frum, reviewing the book in the Washington Post, described it as \\"...by turns gullible, dishonest and weirdly careless.\\" The New Republics Alex Shephard wrote in his review that, \\"There's nothing really in here of interest to Trump's detractors or his supporters‚Äîthere's nothing here for readers, in general.\\" More favorable reviews included one from Jeffrey Lord in the American Spectator. Lord described the book as \\"A serious \\"we were there\\" history of a candidate and campaign that astonished many and, if one were to listen to the mainstream media, infuriated many more\\", adding that \\"a political book can't get much better than this.\\" ==Reaction from Trump== On December 16, 2017, Trump tweeted favorably about the book, writing, \\"Finally people with real knowledge are writing about our wonderful and exciting campaign!\\" ==References== Category:2017 non-fiction books Category:American memoirs Category:Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign Category:Books about the 2016 United States presidential election Category:Books about Donald Trump Category:Political memoirs Category:Media about the Trump presidency Category:Literary collaborations Category:Center Street (publisher) books ","title":"Let Trump Be Trump"},{"id":"56071754","text":"Linus Rebmann (born 4 April 1947) is a Swiss athlete.

After releasing their debut EP and full-length studio album, the band changed their name in March 2017 which also marked the group's new line-up. Their second full-length album is planned for release in 2019 on Hollowed Records. ==History2011‚Äì2013: Formation and EP=== Akeldama formed as a six-piece heavy progressive metal band in Tampa, Florida in mid-2011 by vocalist, guitarist, songwriter, and producer Andrew Zink. After he left his previous group, Zink began to write and record songs on his own and released them on- line which drew some attention. He then recruited several musician friends to learn the material with the prospect of having it performed live. They settled on Akeldama as their name, based on an alias Zink had used on various online forums and video games accounts. On March 28, 2011, Akeldama released their three-track self-titled EP as a free download. It was recorded in Zink's home facility Zink Audio, and he is credited as the sole producer, mixer, and prominent songwriter, with the other members adding their own sections to Zink's ideas. In October 2012, Akeldama performed a set at the eighth edition of the heavy metal Euroblast Festival in Cologne, Germany. Zink and Reibling had asked its founder John Sprich if the band could perform at the event, to which Sprich agreed on the condition that they fund their trip to Cologne and perform without any promotion. Soon after, Sprich met the band in Florida during a family visit and attended a late night rehearsal. Schweitzer recalled: \\"He was really humbling because we thought, at the time, that we were doing everything right ... and he just put us down on our asses and told us that we were doing everything wrong\\". Upon Sprich's suggestion of having the band release a music video online, one was made to \\"Motionless; Emotionless\\" using an iPhone. Akeldama followed their Euroblast set with a small scale European tour supporting Scar Symmetry. ===2013‚Äìpresent: Everything Beautiful and upcoming album=== Akeldama's first full-length studio album, Everything Beautiful, was released independently without a record signing on September 6, 2013. It is a concept album based on what Zink described as \\"two souls who are tied together for eternity through love\\", and features Skyharbor guitarist Keshav Dhar, vocalist Ashe O'Hara formerly of TesseracT, and Scar Symmetry guitarist Per Nilsson. The title track was released as its lead single, a song that Zink said \\"sets the stage for everything\\". It was a critical success, with the album entering the top albums list on metal websites GotDjent and Mind Equals Blown. In June 2014, Akeldama secured a two album distribution deal with the independent label Rogue Records America. To commemorate the signing, the Akeldama EP was remastered and made available as a free digital download. In addition, the band became a part of Project Rogue, a collaborative video project involving members of various rock and metal bands. On 20 March 2017 the group announced the end to Akeldama and their new name, Love at Last. The news coincided with the departure of guitarist and vocalist Jeremy Knapp after his decision to become a fire fighter, so Reibling became guitarist and Zink the band's now sole vocalist. Following a recording deal with the independent label Hollowed Records, their second full-length studio album is planned for release in 2018. In a video posted on the band's Facebook page in October 2017, Owen revealed an upcoming lead single, and described the musical direction of Love at Last as similar to Akeldama with less emphasis on Reibling's harsh vocals and greater use of Zink's higher pitched singing. Owen said the band's name is meant to reflect the musical style and themes addressed in the songs, including positivity and a \\"love conquers all\\" feel. The new album was originally to be a double concept album, but the idea changed into a single album without an overall theme. A 2019 release is scheduled. ==DiscographyEPs=== *Akeldama (2011) ===Studio albums=== *Everything Beautiful (2013) *TBA (2019) ==Band membersCurrent members=== Source. *Andrew Zink ‚Äì lead vocals, production *Connor Reibling ‚Äì guitar (March 2017‚Äìpresent), vocals (until 2017) *Eric Owen ‚Äì guitar *Michael Schweitzer ‚Äì bass *Evan Thibeault ‚Äì drums, percussion ===Former members=== *Jeremy Knapp ‚Äì guitar (until March 2017) ==References *Official Facebook page Category:Musical groups established in 2011 Category:Musical groups disestablished in 2017 Category:Musical groups established in 2017 Category:American progressive metal musical groups Category:Heavy metal musical groups from Florida ","title":"Love at Last"},{"id":"56071813","text":"Angelika Liebsch (born 19 April 1950) is a German athlete.

The time period between the 14th and 18th centuries was known as the most difficult time of plague and cholera epidemics in Europe and Asia. Old chroniclers wrote that the main cause of epidemics in the Middle East was \\"the lack of any sense of hygiene\\". Given that the preparations for the treatment of various infectious diseases recommended by the doctors at the time, such as vinegar, sulfur, and garlic, were ineffective, people came up with the idea of stopping epidemics from spreading by isolating the infected. On July 27, 1377, the Great Council of the Republic adopted a decree which introduced a quarantine as a measure of protection against the spread of infectious diseases by which all merchants, sailors, and goods arriving from \\"suspicious lands\\" could not enter the city if they haven't spent a month in a quarantines which were on the remote, uninhabited islands of Mrkan, Bobara and Supetar. These quarantines were at first in the outdoors but since the weather conditions were almost as deadly as the diseases, the government decided to build few wooden dwellings (wooden so that it could be burned if needed). This decision was made after Dubrovnik was struck by an outbreak of the plague in 1348 which killed a few thousand citizens. This decree was published in Dubrovnik's book of laws, the so-called Green Book (Latin: Liber viridis); Veniens de locis pestiferis non intret Ragusium nel districtum (English: Whoever comes from the infected lands shall not enter Ragusa or its territory).Tanja Ladi≈°iƒá, Uprava Lazareta u Dubrovniku 1814-1873 [Government of the Lazzarettos of Dubrovnik], Dr≈æavni arhiv u Dubrovniku, 2004 In 1397, the Great Council adopted a new decree - De ordinibus contra eos qui veniunt de locis pestiferis anno 1397 factis () which determined duration and the place of the quarantine, imposed penalties for the perpetrators and ordered the appointing of three healthcare officers called kacamorti to supervise the implementation and compliance with quarantine provisions. The penalties for not complying with the provisions of this decree were 100 ducats or prison sentence and severe corporal punishment. The penalty was applied only to commoners. In addition, a Decree prohibited the importation of goods from the countryside for the entire duration of the epidemic. In the 15th century, the quarantine facilities were moved closer to the city because the Ottoman Empire could have used them as a base for the attack on the city. By the mid-15th century, quarantines have become complex institutes that employed scribe, two guards, gravedigger, two cleaners, and additionally, since 1457 epidemic, priest, barber, and two kacamorti's. In 1430, some houses in the Gradac public park were used as quarantine facilities. In 1457, a lazaretto and a Catholic church were built by builder Mihoƒç Radi near Danƒça Beach. The good organization of this lazaretto allowed complete abandonment of quarantines on the islands near Cavtat. This quarantine facility had its own surgeon who replaced barber and two kacamorti's. In 1526, Dubrovnik was struck by the hardest outbreak of the plague which completely paralyzed the city (Government fled the city). Construction of a large lazaretto on Lokrum started in 1533, and was completed at the end of the 16th century. In 1590, the government started with the construction of the lazaretto in Ploƒçe. The constriction was completed in 1642. It contained 10 multistory buildings (5 for goods, 5 for people) connected by 5 interior courtyards. This lazaretto had five areas and five residential buildings for passengers who had to go through quarantine. From each side of the area where the houses for people were, there were the towers for the guards and the apartment for the Ottoman envoy who acted as a judge for Ottoman subjects who were visiting Dubrovnik.http://www.dubrovnik.com//index.php/dubrovnik-highlights/227-the- lazareti-a-medieval-quarantine.html With the construction of the lazarettos, epidemics were significantly suppressed with last breaking out in 1815-16.http://www.matica.hr/hr/326/kuga-nastajanje-identiteta-bolesti-20909/ After the fall of the Republic in 1808, lazarettos were used for quarantine of merchants coming to Dubrovnik from the inner-Balkans, and later for military purposes. Lazarettos were damaged by fire in the second half of the 19th century and again at the end of the First World War. Following the first renovation, the arcades in the courtyards and the gates facing the sea were bricked up. Today, the Lazarettos are used for recreation, trade, and entertainment. On July 7, 2017, Ministry of Regional Development and EU Funds gave 33.8 million kunas to the City of Dubrovnik for the project ‚ÄòLazareti ‚Äì kreativna ƒçetvrt Dubrovnika‚Äô [Lazzarettos - Creative Neighborhood of Dubrovnik]. ==Architecture== Lazarettos were built in stages between 1590 and 1642. At first, three courtyards and a number of covered porches and dwellings for the ship crew members and caravan companions were built. Two additional courtyards and buildings were added later. Every courtyard had a door facing the seaside which was used to unload the goods from the ships. There were concealed porches with large arcades for goods storage on both sides of the yard. Arcades and courtyards form Lazarettos lower ground floor. A staircase leads from these groundfloor courtyards to the upper, large, shared courtyard in which small residential buildings, used for housing passengers who had to go through quarantine, were built. Tenants in these buildings were at the same time guardians of the goods stored in the arcades. Each building had one small window so the ship crew members could look after the stored goods. By the addition of the new part in 1633, Lazarettos had five courtyards with ten porches and ten residential buildings in the upper yard, nine of which were ground floor and one single story.Rudimir Roter, Dubrovaƒçki lazareti ‚Äì jedinstveni pomorsko sanitarni spomenik [Lazzarettos of Dubrovnik - a Unique Maritime Sanitary Monument], Pomorac, year II, number 27, Rijeka, 1950, p. 3 ==References== Category:Buildings and structures in Dubrovnik Category:Quarantine facilities Category:Buildings and structures completed in the 17th century Category:Republic of Ragusa ","title":"Lazzarettos of Dubrovnik"},{"id":"56071870","text":"Barbara Jenkins is a Trinidadian writer, whose work since 2010 has won several international prizes. ==Biography== Barbara Jenkins was born in Belmont, Trinidad.

In her career, she was first a teacher, then a ferry-boat pilot and street car conductor. She was a business woman, airplane pilot, coroner, school principal, and a leader in Arizona women's clubs. Nellie rose to national fame in 1934 for piloting the National Guard across the Colorado River in her boats, in a political protest over the construction of the Parker Dam. ==Early life and education== She was born in 1888 in Cedar County, Missouri to William and Mary Smith Trent. The family moved to the Arizona Territory in 1893 to ease her father's respiratory ailments, which prevented him from being in the work force. They initially settled in Phoenix-adjacent Mesa because of family already residing in the area. Mother and daughter became the sole financial providers. The family lived in a tent in the early years in Arizona.; Nellie shelled nuts to buy her clothes when she was in elementary school, where she first met another student named Joseph E. Bush. He would eventually become her husband and business partner. Determined to get an education, she enrolled in Tempe Normal School (now Arizona State University), financing her education by milking cows, plowing fields, and working in a laundry facility. After earning her teaching license in 1908, she taught in nearby Glendale. She lived in a Glendale hotel room and on weekends took the trolley back home to her parents. Joe Bush was the trolley inspector. During her later years, Arizona journalist Orien W. Fifer wrote about her learning how to drive the city trolley, when she and Joe transported riders during a labor strike.; Arizona was granted statehood, becoming the 48th state in the union on February 14, 1912. Their marriage on December 25, 1912, held in the Trent home, was a double wedding, with Nellie's brother Barney marrying Viola Sanders. ==Life in Yuma County== The couple established a residence in the Yuma County town of Parker on the Colorado River in 1915. During her lifetime, La Paz County, Arizona did not exist. It was created in 1982 out of Yuma, with Parker then becoming the seat of La Paz. Their son Wesley was born about three months after they moved there. Joe bought a ferryboat as a business, and a riverboat as their residence. Nellie taught school in Parker, eventually becoming a school principal. She also became the first woman in the United States to hold a riverboat pilot's license. Together they built a successful business transporting cargo and people across the river. The Bush family helped to develop Parker, investing in a hotel and a bank, and building a power plant.; Prior to World War II, both Nellie and her son were licensed to fly airplanes, leading to the purchase of a family plane and their establishment of the first airport in Parker. She was a member of the Arizona Colorado River Water Commission and the Colorado River Basin States Committee. Nellie had helped form the Glendale Women's Club, and helped start the Parker Woman's Club. She was active in both the American Federation of Women's Clubs and the BPW. ==Politics== Her political career began as a local school trustee. In 1918, she became Justice of the Peace, and coroner, for the city of Parker. According to Orien W. Fifer, her pursuit of a law degree took six years, beginning with an attempt to accomplish it through a correspondence course. She enrolled in the James E. Rogers College of Law in Tucson, enrolling her son Wesley in elementary school there. During at least one summer break, she attended classes at UC Berkeley School of Law. Nellie successfully ran as a Democrat in 1920 for a seat as a representative in the Arizona State Legislature. She passed her bar exam and in 1923 was admitted to the State Bar of Arizona, thereafter becoming a practicing attorney in Yuma County, and city attorney for Parker. Southern Pacific Railroad Company used her as their legal counsel. In 1927, she was the first woman in the legislature to chair the Judiciary committee. That year, she submitted House Bill 50 to create the Arizona Children's Colony to care for children with mental challenges. Governor George W. P. Hunt vetoed the legislation, an action that was met with protest by the state Parent-Teacher Association. The legislature over-rode the veto.; ; When she was president of the American Federation of Women's Clubs, the individual clubs raised $400 to purchase furniture for the colony. For years to come, funding of the colony became a pet cause for women serving in the legislature. In her 1928 first run for a seat in the state senate, she was defeated in the primary election by Hugo B. Farmer, but was successful when she again ran for the state senate seat in 1934 for a two-year term. In a disagreement with the state of California over permission to build the Parker Dam, Arizona Governor Benjamin Baker Moeur designated Nellie \\"Admiral of Arizona's Navy\\" and engaged her boats to transport National Guard troops to protect the state's river rights. The incident propelled her to national fame. At the end of her term in the state senate, Nellie made an unsuccessful run to be Arizona's representative in the United States Congress. In 1940 she was again elected to the state senate, serving one term. ==Later years== After her retirement from public office, Nellie continued to be active in women's clubs and local organizations. She died on October 27, 1963.; *She was inducted into the Arizona Women's Hall of Fame in 1982. *In 2008, she was added to the Women's Plaza of Honor at the University of Arizona. ==ReferencesBibliography== * ==External links== * * * Category:1888 births Category:1963 deaths Category:American female aviators Category:Members of the Arizona House of Representatives Category:Arizona state senators Category:People from Missouri Category:People from Yuma County, Arizona Category:Women state legislators in Arizona Category:Aviators from Missouri Category:Aviators from Arizona Category:Arizona lawyers Category:Arizona local politicians ","title":"Nellie T.

Many food trucks operate in South Korean cities. Some, including ice cream trucks, sell frozen or prepackaged food; others have on-board kitchens and prepare food from scratch. Sandwiches, hamburgers, french fries, and other regional fast food fare is common. In recent years, associated with the pop-up restaurant phenomenon, food trucks offering gourmet cuisine and a variety of specialties and ethnic menus, have become particularly popular. Food trucks, along with portable food booths and food carts, are on the front line of the street food industry that serves an estimated 2.5 billion people every day. ==Current situation of food trucks in South Korea== thumb The advantage of purchasing a truck is that it costs less than opening a restaurant. Food trucks are gaining huge popularity worldwide because they are not only inexpensive but also almost free of charge when starting a business. Republic of Korea's government legalized food trucks in September 2014 and numbers have continued to climb steadily since then. Many young people are trying to create food trucks, and a wider range of products is becoming available. However, it is not possible to operate food trucks everywhere. In the case of Korea, there is only a limited number of places designated by each local government. ==Street food regulations in Korea== Food trucks in Korea must report business reports to the local district office. All other food trucks are illegal, and they can be treated as general food restaurant. It can not be sold anywhere else, but it can be operated only by licensed facilities, tourist attractions, sports facilities, urban parks, and streams. A food truck with a legal license must have a business report in the truck. Not having business report can be considered as illegal food truck. The government is trying to cultivate legal food trucks. Republic of Korea's government legalized food trucks in September 2014. In July 2016, the government reviewed the revision and decision to allow food trucks to move freely in order to ease the grievances of conventional legal food trucks. Government regulations specify that the height of the cooking area shall be less than 1.5 m (1.2 m) and the area shall be not less than 0.5 sq m and not more than 0.5 sq m. ==Korean Food Truck sales manuals== Korean Government announced Food Resources Sales Procedure, Sanitary & Safety Management Manual for Food trucksin 2014.11.12 for the need to set up a business reporting process for the licensee and related agencies in relation to the new food truck sales. === Step 1. Determining the introduction of food truck (Location review) === # Areas where citizens do not tread on their toes. # Areas where vehicles can not obstruct traffic # hygienic areas where waste disposal facilities, such as waste disposal facilities and odor sources, are disposed of. # Electricity trucks available for food truck sales and areas where water supply is available # Safe from vermin, etc. # Consideration of Commercial Market Sales Commercia # Areas with toilet areas available around the neighborhood, etc.  Step 2. Selection of business operators  # Local governments are entitled to select and contract contracts based on local administrative bodies. # Private business operators establish their own regulations, select food truck vendors and contract contracts ‚Äª Precautions for public disclosure i. Food Truck Sales Report Submission : If a food truck operator has secured a business registration card, the food sanitation department issues an approval and requests it as a document issued by the company's permanent resident registration team. ii. Retention of food truck : In case food truck is not required to be sold by taking into consideration the damages on the salesperson who failed to win the bid on condition that food truck is kept as a bid in the early stage of legalization  Step 3. Sales confirmation  When a contractor submits a copy of a business report issued by a local health care department, the company issues a confirmation of the sales confirmation. However, private operators may be substituted by contract documents  Step 4. Post-management  # In case of violation of the allowable area of food truck (time) in the tourist complex, the regulations specify the violation of the contract and manage the contents of the contract. # Violation of \\"Food Hygiene Act\\" in violation of the approval business or outside of the resort area. ==Policies for growth of food trucks Seoul === According to the Seoul city council on July 18, the city council discussed ways to invigorate food trucks in the Seoul Metropolitan area by holding a conference session with related departments and food trucks. According to the Seoul Food and Drug Administration (KFDA) released in Seoul, the number of food trucks reported in Seoul totaled 424,000 in late March, accounting for 32 percent of the total. Currently, the number of food trucks sold is 250 days, and the average business period is 144 days after start-up. Thirty-five percent of the total sales were closed in six months, accounting for about 80 percent of the total sales and the lowest among the total buyers. However, the food truck owners are having a hard time due to a lack of food truck operating areas with stable profits. Seoul City has been searching for possible food truck locations since last September, but it has not been able to set up more than half of the stores due to opposition from existing businesses, insufficient flow populations, and difficulties in transportation. Sales at the store are also sluggish. Another problem was the fact that food truck sales are only taking place at events and festivals. In other words, the movie has limits on the creation of regular profits except for the night market and the Han River project. Such poor conditions caused complaints from vendors at the conference. Korean food truck industry is saturated, eventually sharing and experiencing a rift with the traditional market, said an official at the Korea Food Truck Association, which introduces only about 200,000 to 100,000 won per day in Seocho, where food trucks are relatively popular. Many food truck operators are unable to enter the night market, said an official at the Korea Food Truck Cooperative Federation. \\"We don't have any countermeasures, and we believe that we will be able to sell our cars conveniently,\\" said the youths and the vulnerable. The National Food and Transportation Workers' Union said, \\"We don't want to participate in the top 10 percent of the market.\\" The official also said, \\"The official announcement of the official office is officially posted on the homepage,\\" adding, \\"We are now trying hard to buy a large number of vendors and commissions for paying tuition fees and fees.\\" One food truck operator said, \\"We're worried about increasing food trucks,\\" adding, \\"There are plenty of vendors who are going to shut up in droves, and only food truck makers can be called.\\" In response, the Seoul Metropolitan Government announced that it will boost food trucks by securing business sites. The Seoul Metropolitan Government plans to hire 53 new food trucks, including parks, Hangang River, Seoul, and Seoul, which are recommended by food truck operators in 34 districts, to operate 94 trucks. In addition, if the sales sites were judged to be ineligible for sales, they changed their sales sites and allowed them to obtain counseling from the credit guarantee fund of the credit guarantee fund. Moreover, it plans to expand the night sky market by 5 spots (162 trucks) to 8 (252) by the end of next year. Seoul City has set a goal of boosting the number of food trucks to 800 by next year. The Seoul Metropolitan Government will also step up cooperation with local governments to boost food trucks. Festivals that control large festivals or roads, and festivals that support city budgets, are required to set up an area for food trucks. Local governments were also required to induce participation by special grants or projects for cooperation between municipal and provincial governments. said a Seoul Metropolitan Government official said \\"We need to look at whether there is a conflict between the local authorities and the local government to expand the business force\\" and also they pronounced that \\"We need to find ways to promote the coexistence of existing markets.\\" After presiding over the meeting, Seoul Mayor Park Won-soon said, \\"At least 1,000 trucks should be run in Seoul. We will have three to five jobs per person, and we will conduct a test in Kimpo\\". === Gyeonggi province === Gyeonggi Province council is promoting food trucks to support the underprivileged and youth start-ups. Food trucks are trucks equipped with trucks to cook and sell simple food. Gyeonggi Province council said it will operate two food trucks in the morning and lunch hours at the parking lot in front of the Suwon Chapter of Suwon National Assembly for two weeks from July 18 to 29. Since the Gyeonggi Provincial Office of Food and Drug Administration has a collective lunch facility, it is impossible to establish food trucks according to the original regulations. The official explained, \\"The wiretapping facilities are not permitted to operate food trucks, but we decided to test food trucks to expand food trucks, including public institutions, to expand food trucks.\\" The official added, \\"In particular, if we improve our perception of food trucks and improve our business by improving our business, we will be able to create a very good opportunity for hiring substandard living,\\" adding, \\"We will generate at least two to three employees per food truck.\\" Gyeonggi province council decided to run the trial to promote the establishment of food trucks by improving consumers' vague distrust of food trucks and the current system, which prevents youths and the underprivileged from starting businesses. Another official explained, \\"Food trucks are built according to a given standard by the auto repair company approved by the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, and are subject to regular sanitary checks by relevant authorities, so we have no problems with sanitation measures in the past.\\" First, the company seeks to lift restrictions on the restriction of business zones that prevent food trucks from engaging in food trucks. Food trucks, according to the Food and Hygiene Act, are only permitted to operate in five locations, including urban parks, sports facilities, streams, recreational sites, and tourist attractions to prevent conflicts with existing commercial areas. In order to activate food trucks, the company must expand its sales margin. Accordingly, the government plans to submit a proposal to the government to expand the number of houses including 885 city parks and 3,368 sports facilities, including public facilities. In addition, officials and heads of civic groups will change their perceptions about food trucks. Officials said they still remain negative about food trucks by officials, including the heads of organizations directly responsible for their work, adding that they need to deal with dirty food trucks and keep food truck restaurant operations in the same box office. During the trial period, the company will hold a discussion on how to manage food for the city's executives and employees in the field of pilot operation. The current law also pushes the current law to facilitate the introduction of vulnerable food trucks. Current law requires permission to use and obtain profit from food trucks operating in public places such as parks or sports facilities, where the participation of food trucks by the underprivileged who lack financing is based on the highest bid. The ministry will strongly suggest to the government any areas that need improvement in the system, such as improvement of laws and regulations, that are revealed through the trial run. ==Street foods in Korea== There are number of Street foods which are selling on Food trucks.

The entrepreneurs can lease food trailers from Suwon City Hall. The business hours are from 5pm to 10pm. And duplication of menus is impossible for market trader protection. It is characterized by this food truck zone for young entrepreneurs aged 20 to 39. However, the biggest problem of this food truck zone is that there is a polarization phenomenon between food trucks that are well-run and food trucks that are not. In the TV program 'Baek Jong-won's Food Truck', Baek Jong-won conducted a project to solve the polarization of the Suwon Food Truck Zone. The part 'Gangnam', Lee Hoon who is the entertainer in Korea challenged the food truck business, while the entertainer Cao Lu challenged in the part 'Suwon'. * Information on food truck zone in Suwon {  operating time 5 pm to 10 pm (until material is exhausted) - location Ji-dong Bridge between Yeongdong Market and Ji-dong Market - Number of food trucks About 8 - 10 } * Cream spoon : Cream noodle Topokki (4,000won), Spicy soup Topokki (3,500won), Coconut cream shrimp (5,000won) * Taiwan Night Market : Cheese potato (4,000won), French fries (3,000won), French fries with chili cheese (5,000won), Fish and chips (4,000won) * Cheese ON THE Steak : Mini steak 70g (4,000won) & steak (7,000won) * Eulaschacha - Light bulb juice (Pink lemonade, lemonade, Grapefruit-ade, Traditional tea, etc.) * Cooking laboratory - Meatball boiled in soy sauce, Wingbong boiled in soy sauce * Baleunkkochi - Chicken Skewers * Fantastic Noodle - Barbeque, Barbeque ramen, Spicy seafood ramen * HERS KITCHEN - Garlic cube steak, Beef sushi Han river  Han River Food Truck Zone  Recently, Bamdokkaebi night market is activated, and food trucks in the night market are attracting attention as entrepreneur items. The number of food trucks participating in the Bamdokkaebi night market was only 124 in March 2016. However, the number has increased by 528 over the past year. The liveliness of the Bamdokkaebi night market in Seoul has greatly influenced the food truck business. Market : Shrimp King, Couple Chicken, AB CAFE, Sweet traveling today, KOREAN FOOD, Crepe Hong uncle, Rider's Park, Marine Mali, Gangnam bully, etc.  Food truck in college campus festival  A food truck has become legally accessible even within college campuses. The university can sign up for signing a contract with a university owner who signed a contract with the university and submits the paperwork to the local administrative body. On April 17, The Food and Drug Administration (KFDA) announced a revision of the provisions of the Enforcement Regulations of Enforcement Rules of Food Hygiene Act, which allows food parcels to be sold in college. \\" Currently, the government is allowing food trucks to operate exclusively on Yuwon facilities, tourist attractions, sports facilities, urban parks and streams. However, the revision \\" allowed only universities and those who have signed up to work in restaurants or bakeries \\" and provided opportunities for the university's Food and Drug Administration (FDA) official in an interview with Yonhap News Agency that said. The company announced that they would sign a joint venture with Hyundai Motor Co., a college student, and a college student in universities, colleges and universities, including Hyundai Motor Co., Kuffing Grough, Kunnish, and Yonsei University, to support the campus food trucks catering to college students in college. An official at the ministry explained, We are revising related laws to provide an opportunity for university students to start businesses through food trucks and learn know-how from the industry within universities. ==Baek's Food truck TV show== Baek jong-won's food truck TV show is a television program broadcast on SBS TV on air since July 21, 2017. Baek jong-won is a famous restaurant entrepreneur in South Korea. This program is reality show that Baek observe and coach Food truck businessman who are having problem producing profit. This is an entertainment program on Friday night and its viewer ratings are recorded 5% on average. This indicates the popularity on Food truck in Korea. Since 1960s, Korea's most famous and beloved food is Tteok-bboggi (stir- fried Rice Cake) and this is the classic example of street food. Korea has a long history on Street Food and this made huge popularity on food truck and TV show related on food. ==Globalization of Korean food truck== In the case of past food trucks, most food trucks were offering similar menus, and the design was exactly the same, so the individuality of each food truck could not be easily found. Recently, however, the variety of food trucks has diversified as the menu of food trucks has diversified. It has a great influence on the globalization of food because it can taste Korean food such as takoyaki, taco, Cuban sandwich, New York hot dog, steak, cubbab, yogurt, shrimp, As well as being able to taste food from various countries, fusion of Korean food is becoming one of the menu of food truck. These menus are gaining popularity overseas. That is, branding and globalization of Korean food. === Korean Wave-Korean food trucks === Kogi food truck Kogi Korean BBQ Kogi Korean BBQ has become very popular in Los Angeles, breaking out of its existing image of American food trucks. The main menu is Tacos and Burritos. If you look only at the menu, it is a menu that is often seen in the United States, but it has been combined with Mexican food, which is popular among foreigners, not just tacos and burritos, Bulgogi and Korean pork belly. The reason why Kogi was so popular in the United States is that the use of social networks as well as Korean meals and Mexican meals has also become a key to popularity. Using the mobility of food trucks, they share the schedule of the week by sending the route of the food truck to the messenger. The use of this mobility to play has attracted great popularity in the United States, and it has always been the topic of where they will appear.  Stew luck  Stew Luck is a Korean-style food truck with the goal of 'News tile Korean food truck, run our world with our superior Korean menu'. They became Korea's No. 1 Korean food truck with support from the Ministry of Food, Agriculture, Forestry and Livestock and the Korean Food Foundation. The menu is spicy steamed chicken, sweet chestnut steamed, ribs tacos, and it has taken the characteristics of Korean food as it is, adding the foreign food on it and finished the branding of natural Korean food.  Miss Corea  Miss Corea is a food truck that kimchi fried rice made by combining Korean kimchi with cast iron cauldron. Kimchi fried rice was branded by combining it with ingredients that foreigners, such as egg fry, spam, and sausage, which are not used as they are, are familiar. Miss Corea is a differentiator for foreigners so that they can go a little easier by showing kimchi fried rice.  Korilla BBQ  Korilla BBQ is a popular food truck in New York. They got recognition in the US Food Truck survival program 'The Great Food Truck Race'. Like Kogi, use Twitter every morning to announce the opening hours and places. It looks like food that can be easily seen locally, such as burritos, rice balls, salad balls, and tacos, but the ingredients in it are roasted meat, spicy pork, tofu, white rice, miso soup, kimchi fried rice, Which provides a familiar and unfamiliar experience for foreigners. ==References== Category:Food trucks Category:Street food in South Korea ","title":"Food trucks in South Korea"},{"id":"56072399","text":"Mohib Banda is a village and union council in Mardan District of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. ==References== Category:Union councils of Mardan District Category:Populated places in Mardan District ","title":"Mohib Banda"},{"id":"56072400","text":"Spin squeezing is a quantum process that decreases the variance of one of the angular momentum components in an ensemble of particles with a spin. The quantum states obtained are called spin squeezed states. Such states can be used for quantum metrology, as they can provide a better precision for estimating a rotation angle than classical interferometers. == Mathematical definition == Spin squeezed states for an ensemble of spins have been defined analogously to squeezed states of a bosonic mode. A quantum state always obeys the Heisenberg uncertainty relation (\\\\Delta J_x)^2(\\\\Delta J_y)^2 \\\\geqslant \\\\frac 1 4 \\\\langle J_z \\\\rangle ^2, where J_l are the collective angular momentum components defined as J_l=\\\\sum_n j_l^{(n)}, and j_l^{(n)} are the single particle angular momentum components. The state is spin-squeezed in the x-direction, if the variance of the x-component is smaller than the square root of the right-hand side of the inequality above (\\\\Delta J_x)^2 < \\\\frac 1 2 \\\\langle J_z \\\\rangle . It is important that z is the direction of the mean spin. A different definition was based on using states with a reduced spin- variance for metrology. == Applications in quantum metrology == Spin squeezed states can be used to estimate a rotation angle with a precision better than the classical or shot-noise limit. In particular, if the almost maximal mean spin points to the z-direction, and the state is spin-squeezed in the x-direction, then it can be used to estimate the rotation angle around the y-axis. For instance, this can be used for magnetometry. == Relations to quantum entanglement == Spin squeezed states can be proven to be entangled based on measuring the spin length and the variance of the spin in an orthogonal direction. Let us define the spin squeezing parameter \\\\xi_{\\\\rm s}^2=N\\\\frac{(\\\\Delta J_x)^2} {\\\\langle J_z \\\\rangle ^2}, where N is the number of the spin-1/2 particles in the ensemble. Then, if \\\\xi_{\\\\rm s}^2 is smaller than 1 then the state is entangled. It has also been shown that a higher and higher level of multipartite entanglement is needed to achieve a larger and larger degree of spin squeezing. == Experiments with atomic ensembles == Experiments have been carried out with cold or even room temperature atomic ensembles. In this case, the atoms do not interact with each other. Hence, in order to entangle them, they make them interact with light which is then measured. A 20 dB (100 times) spin squeezing has been obtained in such a system. Simultaneous spin squeezing of two ensembles, which interact with the same light field, has been used to entangle the two ensembles. Spin squeezing can be enhanced by using cavities. Cold gas experiments have also been carried out with Bose-Einstein Condensates (BEC). In this case, the spin squeezing is due to the interaction between the atoms. Most experiments have been carried out using only two internal states of the particles, hence, effectively with spin-1/2 particles. There are also experiments aiming at spin squeezing with particles of a higher spin. Nuclear-electron spin squeezing within the atoms, rather than interatomic spin squeezing, has also been created in room temperature gases. == Creating large spin squeezing == Experiments with atomic ensembles are usually implemented in free-space with Gaussian laser beams. To enhance the spin squeezing effect towards generating non-Gaussian states, which are metrologically useful, the free-space apparatuses are not enough. Cavities and nanophotonic waveguides have been used to enhance the squeezing effect with less atoms. For the waveguide systems, the atom-light coupling and the squeezing effect can be enhanced using the evanescent field near to the waveguides, and the type of atom-light interaction can be controlled by choosing a proper polarization state of the guided input light, the internal state subspace of the atoms and the geometry of the trapping shape. Spin squeezing protocols using nanophotonic waveguides based on the birefringence effect and the Faraday effect have been proposed. By optimizing the optical depth or cooperativity through controlling the geometric factors mentioned above, the Faraday protocol demonstrates that, to enhance the squeezing effect, one needs to find a geometry that generates weaker local electric field at the atom positions. This is counterintuitive, because usually to enhance atom-light coupling, a strong local field is required. But it opens the door to perform very precise measurement with little disruptions to the quantum system, which cannot be simultaneously satisfied with a strong field. == Generalized spin squeezing == In entanglement theory, generalized spin squeezing also refers to any criterion that is given with the first and second moments of angular momentum coordinates, and detects entanglement in a quantum state. For a large ensemble of spin-1/2 particles a complete set of such relations have been found, which have been generalized to particles with an arbitrary spin. Apart from detecting entanglement in general, there are relations that detect multipartite entanglement. Some of the generalized spin- squeezing entanglement criteria have also a relation to quantum metrological tasks. For instance, planar squeezed states can be used to measure an unknown rotation angle optimally. == References == Category:Quantum information science Category:Quantum optics ","title":"Spin squeezing"},{"id":"56072402","text":"Pseudophoxinus caralis is a species of ray-finned fish in the family Cyprinidae.

Members of the family formed three businesses: A. E. & F. Tolley, wine merchants of Leigh Street, Adelaide, Tolley Scott & Tolley, distillers of Stepney and Nuriootpa, better known by the initials \\"T.S.T.\\", and Douglas A. Tolley Pty, Ltd., winemakers of Hope Valley. ==History== Albion James Tolley (1819‚Äì1901), his wife Fanny, n√©e Darbon, (1830‚Äì1899) and three children arrived in South Australia aboard Gipsy in August 1853. In 1858 he set up in business as wine merchant (and occasional hotel broker) Tolley & Co., on Currie Street, first at no. 75 then 21 from 1860. They returned to England in 1866, living at Chertsey, where their third son Doug was born. The family returned to Adelaide aboard Collingrove in January 1873, and sons Sydney and Frederick were enrolled at St. Peter's College; eldest son A.E. Tolley had returned in 1870. By 1881 he had retired, alternately living in Adelaide and \\"The Grange\\", South Norwood, London. In August 1885 he and Mrs. Tolley left South Australia for the last time aboard RMS Parramatta. ===A. E. & F. Tolley=== In 1874 eldest son Albion E. Tolley (occasionally referred to by his middle name Everard, presumably to differentiate from his father) formed a partnership with Phillip Charles J. Campbell to operate a licensed store in Peel Street, then Leigh Street. The partnership was dissolved in May 1875, with Campbell continuing as traveller and salesman for Tolley. In 1876 A. E. Tolley purchased Haussen's wine and liquor store on Currie Street, adjacent the John Bull Inn, H. H. Haussen resuming ownership of the Hindmarsh Brewery. :Albion Everard Tolley (1849 ‚Äì 7 June 1922) was born at Sunbury-on-Thames, emigrated aboard Gipsy, arriving in Adelaide in 1852. He was educated at St. Matthews's (Church of England) School, Kensington, and St. Peter's College. The family returned to England, living at Chertsey; young Albion returned to Adelaide accompanied by his father in April 1870 aboard Norfolk, and gained commercial experience with merchants Jones, Scott, & Co. of Melbourne. :He was a keen yachtsman, and at the time of his death was Vice-Commodore of the Royal South Australian Yacht Squadron. While in England in 1914 he purchased a comfortable motor yacht, in which he frequently took parties of friends around Port Adelaide and St. Vincents Gulf. He also took an interest in horticulture, and had a fine garden at his home in Unley Park. In 1883 Albion took on his brother Frederick as partner as A. E. & F. Tolley, and rented a section of Thomas Hardy and Sons' premises at 85 Currie Street, which they did not fully relinquish until 1901. :Frederick Osborne Tolley (1856 ‚Äì 21 April 1913), as were his brothers, was described as cheery and good natured, an excellent companion, and a delightful host. No other accomplishments were mentioned in his obituary apart from the magnificent garden at his home, \\"Lowan\\" on Park Terrace, Gilberton. They opened stores in Fremantle, Esperance and Norseman. In 1891 they purchased the Grenfell Street firm of Heseltine and Reid and in 1893, in conjunction with George Milne they purchased the wine and spirits stock of the S.A. Brewing, Malting and Wine and Spirit Company Limited, who had decided to concentrate on their core business, brewing beer, as the S.A. Brewing Company. A. E. & F. Tolley was re-formed as a limited liability family company on 30 July 1910 with directors A. E. Tolley, F. O. Tolley, and Alfred E. Stephens as directors. Many family members served on the board, and are mentioned in the Family list below. In 1913 a new building was erected at 82 Waymouth Street. ===Tolley, Scott & Tolley=== This company had its origin as the East Torrens Wine Making and Distillation Company at Nelson Street, Stepney in 1858, with Henry Mildred its first chairman of directors. The business was wound up in 1862, blaming insufficient capital for its failure. It was purchased by Hakan Linde (1822 ‚Äì 17 January 1907), a coppersmith from Sweden, who built a distillation plant on the site, at some stage named the \\"Phoenix Distillery\\", \\"Phoenix\\" would be an apt name for Linde's distillery, but its use during that time is not certain; the best evidence so far is a photograph of the premises, dated 1888, published in the Bishop book. and operated it profitably. Lindes Lane, off Rundle Street, was the site of his workshop. :Ernest \\"Tim\\" Tolley (11 October 1862 ‚Äì 3 June 1925) was born on South Terrace, Adelaide, and was educated at St. Peter's College. In 1879 he was sent for three years to King's College London, where he studied under professors Thompson and (Sir Charles Loudon) Bloxam (1831-1887). He spent another three years in France, gaining winemaking experience at √âpernay and Narbonne. On returning to England in 1885, he was apprenticed to Thomas Scott at his London distillery. :Thomas Scott (c. 1830 ‚Äì 15 April 1899) had experience of distillation with one Menzies (perhaps the Caledonian distillery of Graham Menzies & Co.), Jersey, Peru and London, this last being his own business on Abbey Street, Bermondsey, South London, where he employed the two Tolley sons as apprentices. He left the Adelaide in 1893 for London, promising to return, but died at Deal, England. :Douglas \\"Doug\\" Tolley (20 October 1866 ‚Äì 13 February 1932) was born in Chertsey, Surrey, also went to St. Peter's College, then studied at King's College London for five years. He was also apprenticed to Thomas Scott in 1885. :At some time he also gained experience in brandy making while working at Hennessy and Martell, brands no doubt handled by his family. T.S.T. distillery, Stepney The two brothers returned to Adelaide in December 1886 and May 1887, followed by Scott in 1888, in which year they purchased the \\"Phoenix Distillery\\" and promptly set about enlarging the facilities. A fourth partner, John Linnett, a Cockney partner of Scott with previous Australian experience, came out in 1891 and served as a manager. A son, John Archibald Linnett (died 1954), was a longtime resident of American River, Kangaroo Island. In the early 1890s the grape-growers of Nuriootpa, Angaston and Tanunda were facing the prospect of another year's surplus with the concomitant problems of low prices and having to dump tons of rotting grapes. They appealed to the Tolleys to erect a distillery in their midst, and gave to the company as a \\"sweetener\\" a few acres of land at the intersection of Angaston and Tanunda Roads, Nuriootpa. The plan was put into effect and the Angas Park distillery was the result, producing T.S.T. brandy and spirit for production of fortified wines. The outcome was most satisfactory all round: the growers no longer were forced to suffer a loss in times of glut, and Tolley Scott & Tolley had a lucrative export trade. In 1898 they purchased the \\"Nuriootpa Cellars\\" winery established by S. and W. Sage on the other side of the road, and installed pipes under the road for transfer of distilled spirit to the cellars. That same year they purchased a nearby property of which they named \\"Bucklands\\" (recalling the name of A. E. Tolley's old property at Plympton) and added to it another . In 1904 they upgraded the distillation plant at Nuriootpa. In January 1921 the business was re-formed as a limited liability company with Arthur Scott Linnett, another son, as secretary. Linnett resigned in 1927 after some erratic behaviour, and became licensee of the Nairne Hotel. By 1924 they had of bond storage at Nuriootpa, and a similar capacity in their wine cellars. Sam and Len Tolley took over management of the company around this time, and a very large export market was developed; over half the brandy production going to Singapore and Malaya. Production at Stepney ceased around 1946, and the cellars devoted to maturation of brandy and fortified wines. The business was restructured as a public company in 1959 and was acquired in 1961 by the Australian arm of The Distillers Company. The old Stepney buildings were renovated as company offices in 1972. ===Douglas A. Tolley Pty, Ltd.=== Douglas A. Tolley, independently of his involvement with T.S.T. in 1891 founded a vineyard and winery at Hope Valley. By 1903 his plantings covered some . His son Leonard J. Tolley succeeded him as governing director of the firm, producing mostly bulk wine for interstate customers. On Leonard's death his three sons Peter, David and Reginald shared management duties. David Tolley developed the Tolley Pedare (for Peter/David/Reginald) gewurztraminer grape variety in the mid-1970s. Peter's son Christopher was the first of the fourth generation to be involved in the company. Mildara Blass purchased the winery in 1995. ==Family== Albion James Tolley (1819 ‚Äì 12 January dateline 18 January 1901) and Fanny Tolley, n√©e Darbon, (1830 ‚Äì 27 December 1899) emigrated to Australia aboard Gipsy, arriving in August 1853, lived at Brougham Place, North Adelaide; \\"Shirley Lodge\\" Beulah Road, Norwood, South Australia, retired to \\"The Grange\\", South Norwood, Surrey, England by 1885, and died at his home \\"Hurstleigh\\" in the same suburb.

The Alberg 30 incorporates design elements from the similar Alberg Odyssey 30 of two years earlier. ==Production== The boat was built by Whitby Boat Works in Canada, who completed more than 700 examples, but it is now out of production. Construction was changed during the production run. Early models have a laminated wood mast brace and no liner, with a masonite-cored deck that drains overboard via the toe rail. Later models feature an aluminum mast brace inside a molded fiberglass liner, balsa- cored decks that drain through cockpit scupper drain hoses. Some boats built during the transitional period have mixed features. ==Design== The Alberg 30 is a small recreational keelboat, built predominantly of fiberglass, with wood trim. It has a masthead sloop rig, a keel-mounted rudder and a fixed long keel. It displaces and carries of iron ballast. The boat has a draft of with the standard keel. The boat was factory fitted with a range of inboard engines. These included a Gray Marine gasoline engine of , a Universal Atomic 4 gasoline engine of a Bukh single cylinder diesel engine of , a Volvo Penta MD7A diesel engine and a Volvo 2002 diesel engine. The fuel tank holds and the fresh water tank has a capacity of . The boat has a PHRF racing average handicap of 228 with a high of 240 and low of 219. It has a hull speed of . ==Operational history== In a review Michael McGoldrick wrote, \\"The design of the Alberg 30 dates back to 1961, and some of its features and appearance are reminiscent of the old wooded sailboats of the 1950s and 1940s. It is interesting to note that when they first started making sailboats out of fiberglass, they tended to build up the hull and other structural areas to the same thickness that would have been found on wooden boats. This extra fiberglass resulted in extremely strong and rugged boats, and this is certainly true of the Alberg 30.

By the 1980s the business declined, in the 1990s it was taken over by Motherwell Bridge Ltd and shortly afterwards closed down. In May 2007, preparation of the site was started. Unwanted buildings were demolished but the former Matthews furniture factory was left intact and is now part of the outlet centre. By October 2007,construction had started and three cranes were erected on the site by November 2007. The upper level of the centre was started on 6 May 2008, it was designed with a distinctive gull-wing shaped steel and glass roof over the central courtyard which was installed around the end of August 2008. In February 2009, the interior of the Outlet centre was well under way. On 1 July 2009, the south-east side of the outlet centre was opened up as a 96-room Travelodge. In November 2011 as part of Phase 2, a planning development was granted to convert the first floor and roof to a 10-screen cinema. Permission was also granted to convert blocks L, M, N and P of the ground floor to restaurants and take-aways. In April 2017, the ¬£141 million development of Bakers Quay began. The development, by Rokeby Merchant Developments (Gloucester) Limited, will take place in 2 phases. Phase one will consist of 47 apartments, a 104 bedroom Premier Inn, Brewers Fayre restaurant, a drive-through Costa Coffee and 4 three bedroom houses. Phase 2 will consist of another 73 apartments. The first phase was completed in August 2018 and the second phase should be completed by December 2019. ==History== On 30 May 2009, Gloucester Quays was opened by Gok Wan. But it opened up with only 40 stores with a further 16 being let in the upcoming weeks. Initially, between May 2009 and November 2010, the centre failed to meet expectations with less customers than predicted. This was due to the fact that it opened during the middle of an economic recession. However, despite the initial struggles the outlet centre continued to expand adding spaces for 37 new businesses. A shopping outlet area which has been incorporated with the old warehouses in Gloucester Docks On 5 December 2013, in a ¬£60 million Quayside development, the nearby Cineworld moved from the Peel Centre across the road into the Quays and was renamed Cineworld Gloucester Quays. It is a fully digitalised 10-screen cinema complex with a 1,600-seat capacity. Also at this time, another 11 new restaurants and bars were opened including Zizzi's and Chimichanga. Since January 2015, 14 more stores and restaurants have opened including Clarks, Skechers, Jaeger, Brewhouse & Kitchen, Bella Italia and Bill's. In November 2015, Fat Face, Bench, Tricker's shoes and Carluccio's opened at the Quays. On 3 October 2015, a fire took place in the Provender Mill which was one of the most iconic buildings in Gloucester. Two teenagers were charged with arson. The fire caused ¬£2 million worth of damage and took 10 fire engines and 45 firefighters to put out. Between June and November 2017, Ted Baker, Jack Wills, Timberland and Joules opened at the centre. In December 2017, Explore Learning a children's tuition centre opened. It was also announced that Cath Kidston Limited would open in the New Year. The following month, it was confirmed they would be opening on 18 January 2018. In March 2018, it was announced that Peel Holdings would invest another ¬£100 million into the Quays. The funds will be used to add a second floor to the shopping centre and revamp the surrounding outdoor squares. ==Markets== Since the centre has opened, there have been food festivals and Victorian Christmas markets which return every year. ==References== Category:Outlet malls in England Category:Shopping malls established in 2009 Category:Buildings and structures in Gloucester Category:Shopping centres in Gloucestershire ","title":"Gloucester Quays"},{"id":"56072711","text":"The Moyers Building, at S.

Ramalingam. The film features Ranjith and Anamika in lead roles, with Ravichandran, Pyramid Natarajan, Manivannan, Vasu Vikram, Rajesh, Raj Kapoor, T. P. Gajendran, Alex and Pandu playing supporting roles. The film was produced by G. Moorthy, its musical score, by Gandhidasan and it was released on 3 June 2005. ==Plot== Malayappan (Ranjith) is a notorious brigand, living in the forest, who kidnaps the former Chief Minister Tamizharasan (Ravichandran) and demands a huge ransom to the government. The current Chief Minister Veerabhadran (Pyramid Natarajan) in any case is glad that his arch-political rival and leader of the opposition has been kidnapped by Malayappan. Veerabhadran declares to the media that he will not negotiate with Malayappan and he will not give a single penny to the brigand. Malayappan realizes that he made a mistake by kidnapping the wrong person. Therefore, the cunning Tamizharasan suggests that Malayappan kidnap Veerabhadran's daughter and Malayappan follows his advice. Veerabhadran, who now wants to save his daughter at any cost, sends the popular news reporter Muthuvel (Vasu Vikram) to negotiate with the brigand in the forest. Thereafter, Malayappan releases Veerabhadran's daughter and a video of him killing Tamizharasan. Following the fiasco, the governor of Tamil Nadu dismissed the current state government and Veerabhadran lost his Chief Minister post. Malayappan even gets a general amnesty and receives a government bungalow. Tamizharasan is indeed alive and that video of him being killed was a sham. Malayappan, who was hiding in the forests so far, is hailed by the people of Tamil Nadu. Thus Malayappan forms a political party after seeing his growing popularity. According to the survey, Malayappan has a good probability to become the new Chief Minister. Veerabhadran and Tamizharasan's party members then join Malayappan's party. In the end, the brigand cum politician Malayappan wins the election by a huge margin and becomes the new Chief Minister. In the meantime, Malayappan marries his lover Ponni (Anamika). Unlike the former Chief Ministers, Malayappan wants to help the people and starts his fight against corruption. What transpires next forms the crux of the story. ==Cast== *Ranjith as Malayappan *Anamika as Ponni *Ravichandran as Tamizharasan *Pyramid Natarajan as Veerabhadran *Manivannan as Marudhanayagam *Vasu Vikram as Muthuvel *Rajesh as Manivasagam *Raj Kapoor as Raja *T.

Ramalingam, a one-time associate of director K. Bhagyaraj, made his directorial debut with Padhavi Paduthum Paadu. He said, \\"though it is about Veerappan, it's no serious stuff. It's a political spoof certain to draw humour in the theatre\\". The movie was shot in Chennai, Tiruvannamalai, Sathyamangalam and Anthiyur forest areas where the brigand Veerappan lived. ==Soundtrack== The film score and the soundtrack were composed by film composer Gandhidasan.

It just doesn't realise that too much of a good thing can end up being bad too. Some judicious editing and better marketing might have improved its fortunes at the box-office\\". Malathi Rangarajan of The Hindu wrote, \\"Veerappan would probably do a somersault in his grave if he sees himself portrayed as a gullible nincompoop on the one hand and an honest Minister on the other. And all these without an iota of finesse\\". Sify said, \\" a disappointing venture as screenplay and direction goes haywire as the dialogue writer and director does far too much political pontification\\" and labelled the film as avoidable. Indiaglitz wrote, \\"that is tantamount to practising for the Olympics marathon by jogging in the park. Satire needs punch and power. But that is sadly missing in this.

She entered service in 1993 as the third submarine of the Walrus class, after and . Dolfijn has been deployed both for naval exercises and in combat operations around the world. Furthermore, the submarine plays an important role by performing intelligence operations. ==Activities== HNLMS Dolfijn has taken part in several operations, a few examples are: * During NATO operation Allied Force, Dolfijn upheld a trade embargo off the coast of former Yugoslavia. She also eavesdropped enemy communication and forwarded the obtained information to the military forces of the NATO. At the same time she also forwarded enemy ship movements to the Western European Union.de Bles, Boven and Homburg, pp. 104 * In 2012 Dolfijn took part in anti-piracy operation Ocean Shield that took place off the coast of Somalia. * At the beginning of 2013 the Netherlands Maritime Special Operations Forces (NLMARSOF) trained with the Dolfijn in the Caribbean Sea. This is important because in the area there is a lot of illegal drug trade and the Netherlands tries to stop this with other countries. == Maintenance and upgrade == In 2016 Dolfijn was taken out of service after being active for years by the Royal Netherlands Navy to perform maintenance and modernize its systems. For example, the ageing GIPSY combat system will be replaced with the more modern Guardion combat system. Besides changing the software suit, hardware components were also either replaced or upgraded with newer versions. The Medium Range Sonar (MRS) and Long Range Sonar (LRS) will get replaced by new ones. In addition a new sonar was added, which is called the Mine and Obstacle Avoidance Sonar (MOAS). The Consoles and screens in the command room also will get an upgrade to more modern versions, while the navigation and attack periscopes will go from being depended on analog sensors to digital sensors. This will be done by replacing several masts. The holes have already been drilled for this upgrade. Lastly, the Mark 48 torpedoes were upgraded from Mod 4 to the more recent Mod 7. == COVID-19 pandemic == On 30 March, the Ministry of Defence reported that eight crew members of the Dutch submarine Dolfijn had tested positive. Out of 58 crew members, 15 sailors with mild symptoms were tested. The submarine changed course near Scotland to return to the Netherlands two weeks early, arriving in Den Helder on 3 April. ==See also== * Ships of the Royal Netherlands Navy ==ReferencesSources=== * == External links == * Koninklijke Marine * Walrus-class submarines * Walrusklasse onderzeeboten * Onderzeeboot Zeeleeuw kan weer 10 jaar mee * Opknapbeurt voegt dimensie toe * Vernieuwde Zeeleeuw maakte grote sprong door de tijd Category:Walrus-class submarines Category:Active submarines of the Netherlands Category:1990 ships Category:Ships built in the Netherlands Category:Naval ships involved in the COVID-19 pandemic ","title":"HNLMS Dolfijn (1990)"},{"id":"56072776","text":"Kot Jhungra is a village and union council in Mardan District of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. ==References== Category:Union councils of Mardan District Category:Populated places in Mardan District ","title":"Kot Jhungra"},{"id":"56072799","text":"Seri Bahlol is a village and union council in Mardan District of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. ==References== Category:Union councils of Mardan District Category:Populated places in Mardan District ","title":"Seri Bahlol, Mardan"},{"id":"56072814","text":"The 1991 Virginia Cavaliers men's soccer team represented the University of Virginia during the 1991 NCAA Division I men's soccer season.

It started on May 1, 2015 in Zhenjiang and finished in Berlin on December 2, 2016. It was in the support of band's eighteenth studio album Return to Forever and it was also celebration of band's fifty years in music business. Tour was ranked by Pollstar at No. 79 at their \\"Top 100 Worldwide Tour\\" chart for 2015 with total gross of $22,400,000 and total of 375.576 tickets sold from 51 concerts. It was also ranged by Pollstar at No. 68 at their \\"Top 100 Worldwide Tour\\" chart for 2016 with total gross of $26,200,000 and total of 383,398 tickets sold from 59 concerts. It was, also, the last Scorpions worldwide tour to feature James Kottak and first worldwide tour to feature Mikkey Dee as a band's official drummer. ==Background== In 2010 Scorpions announced farewell tour. Before they retire, they wanted to release a bonus track album from leftovers from seventies and eighties just for the fans. After playing the final show in Munich in December, 2012, band planned to take a break and go on vacation. In January, 2013, MTV contacted the band and asked if they are interested in doing the MTV Unplugged album. They agreed on doing that project and turned out to be successful. That whole thing pushed back the bonus track project. As soon as they have finished the MTV Unplugged project, band immediately went back to studio to work on bonus track project. Band was listening the recordings they have already prepared for the project. They were happy with the result and Rudolf Schenker said that he has a tape with some songs that they could also use for this project. While searching for the tape, Schenker found an old ledger in which his mother enumerated the loans that his father provided to him, so he could buy all the equipment and establish the band. He looked into the book and it said: \\"September, 1965\\". He went back to the studio and told the band what he found and their manager said that it would be great idea to celebrate 50th Anniversary since they are the only German band who is 50 years in music and one of the few in the world along with The Rolling Stones, The Who, Beach Boys and Pink Floyd. Manager suggested to the band that they contact the promoters and see if they were interested in the band doing the 50th Anniversary Tour. Then Schenker suggested that if the band was going to do a 50th Anniversary Tour, then the band needed to release a brand new studio album. So the band went again into the listening process of bonus track material that they had already prepared and see if they could improve something, like choruses and riffs. After that, they re-recorded the old stuff and started to write new songs with the producers Mikael Nord Andersson and Martin Hansen. The result was the album Return to Forever. On August 16, 2014 Scorpions released through their social media a promotional picture with which they announced 50th Anniversary Tour and new studio album for 2015. On December 18, 2014, band announced 2015 spring and summer European tour dates as well as German tour dates for the March, 2016. North American dates for September and October 2016 with special quest Queensr√øche were announced on June 16, 2015, on very same day when were released North American release dates for the album Return to Forever (2015) and first single \\"We Built This House\\". On May 1, 2015, band performed on Changjiang International Music Festival in front of 100,000 people, making this their first performance in China in their career. Between May 13 and May 21, 2016, Scorpions have performed their first time ever concert residency at The Joint in Las Vegas. Originally, band received an offer two do full month residency concert, but it didn't worked out for various reasons, so band was only able to perform five shows. October 18, 2016, Scorpions performed in Palais Theatre in Melbourne, Australia, marking their first concert in Australia in their career. Concert in Bangkok scheduled for October 26, 2016 was cancelled because of the death of king Bhumibol Adulyadej. ==Stage and performances== Show set was designed by G√ºnter J√§ckle and Rainer Becker designed lighting. Manfred Nikitser, associated lighting designer and director also joined production team. Nikitser chose two GrandMA2 full-size desks, one grandMA2 light, 2 MA VPU plus MK2 video processing units, 2 MA NPU network processing units and 2 MA network switches. The lights used consist of 36 Clay Paky A.leda B-EYE K20s, 8 Sharpy Wash 330s, 10 Mythos units and 20 Stormy CCs. Stage design also consists of a big L.E.D. back screen, a set screen, and two IMAG screens. The set also has four crossbars and ladders. Stage also features flying platform with drum kit with the Sharpy Wash lights placed underneath. Nikister said that those lights were chosen because those lights are the best from point of compactness, high output and speed. PRG Nocturne provided all the equipment. MANIK Show Lighting and Manfred Nikitser managed the Lighting control console and MA VPUs. The visual content was dealt with by Hans-Otto Richter and Nikitser. Every show started with a sound of sirens and curtain falling down. After that, band opened show with song \\"Going Out With a Bang\\" following with songs \\"Make It Real\\" and \\"The Zoo\\". During the performance of the song \\"The Zoo\\", Meine would tossing his cowbell drumsticks into the crowd. That song was followed by an instrumental \\"Coast to Coast\\" which lead to so-called \\"70's Medley\\" during which the band performed snippets of the songs \\"Top of the Bill\\", \\"Steamrock Fever\\", \\"Speedy's Coming\\" and \\"Catch Your Train\\". Medley was followed by performance of the song \\"We Built This House\\" and electric guitar instrumental \\"Delicate Dance\\" during which Matthias Jabs plays electric guitar with a guest guitar player,his technician,Ingo Powitzer. \\"Delicate Dance\\" was followed with an \\"Acoustic Medley\\" during which band plays acoustic versions of the songs \\"Always Somewhere\\", \\"Eye of the Storm\\" and \\"Send Me an Angel\\". That followed with \\"Wind of Change\\", \\"Rock 'n' Roll Band\\" and \\"Dynamite\\". After that James Kottak played his drum solo while his drum platform was risen above the stage. During his performance, pictures of all band's album covers were shown on the screen. When Kottak finished with his drum solo, band would return to stage to play \\"Blackout\\" during which Rudolf Schenker played electric guitar with dry ice dispenser. Band finished concert with \\"No One Like You\\" and \\"Big City Nights\\". After the concert was done, band return to stage to play \\"Still Loving You\\" and \\"Rock You Like a Hurricane\\". During the concert in Barclays Center In Brooklyn on September 12, 2015, 12-year old guitarist Brandon Niederauer joined the band on stage to play guitar on song \\"No One Like You\\". ==Live streaming and recordings== Scorpions teamed up with Yahoo! for their first global live streaming. Yahoo! streamed band's live performance on September 12, 2015 at 9:10 p.m. ET from Barclays Center in Brooklyn. Live streaming was available for desktop computers on Yahoo! Screen website and through Yahoo! Screen application for mobile devices with iOS and Android or connected devices (Apple TV, Roku, Xbox). On April 22, 2016, band released version of the album Return to Forever (2015) called Return to Forever: Tour Edition which has seven bonus tracks and two bonus DVD's. Those DVDs include full performances of the band on Barclays Center, full band's performance on Hellfest on June 20, 2015 and documentary called On the Road in America directed by Dennis Dirksen. Filmed in Los Angeles, Santa Barbara and Las Vegas, documentary takes a look at the group's impressive longevity and continued popularity in the United States. ==Klaus Meine health issues and departure of James Kottak== On March 21, 2016, 30 minutes into the concert at Barclaycard Arena in Hamburg, Klaus Meine complained about sore throat. Band was forced to stop the concert and Meine went for medical exam. He was diagnosed with advanced viral infection and larynx and trachea inflammation. To get whole health situation under control, Meine went under the medical treatment and doctors banned him to sing for several weeks and because of that, concerts at Lanxess Arena in Cologne, Arena Leipzig in Leipzig, Festhalle in Frankfurt, Mercedes-Benz Arena in Berlin and Barclaycard Arena in Hamburg had to be postponed. Around that time, James Kottak had some personal issues and he went to Eric Claptons's Crossroads Centre in Antigua for one month rehab treatment. While staying there, Kottak decided to stay for two more weeks with a plan to go back on the tour with the band right after the treatment. Band members advised him to take advantage of this treatment and that he stays longer. They said that they will call Mikkey Dee to replace him as a drummer on the upcoming tour dates and Kottak agreed on that. He stayed in Crossroads Centre until end of July, 2016 and he stayed there for total of 92 days. Since the next batch of concerts was in South America in September, 2016, all the band's sound equipment and instruments were transporting there at that time. Since swapping Dee's drums and equipment with Kottak's would cost between 25,000-$30,000, Kottak and rest of the band agreed that is better for Dee to finish rest of the tour since there were only small number of shows left. Kottak decided to stay at home for a little while and next time when he and band talked, they mutually agreed that it just doesn't make any sense for him to continue playing with the band. ==Critical and commercial reception== Seb Male from The Edge said about the band's performance on Ramblin' Man Fair in 2015: \\" Scorpions were nearly half an hour late on stage, prompting some disappointed fans to head over to watch Camel on the Prog Stage instead, but when they finally did arrive they were definitely on form. Klaus Meine remains pitch-perfect after all these years\\". Jason MacNeil from Toronto Sun said about the concert in Molson Canadian Amphitheatre on September 18, 2015 that \\"it seems the band is running on fumes\\". Mark LePage from Montreal Gazette said about the concert in Bell Centre on September 19, 2015 that \\"At 67, Meine could easily have passed for a decade younger in both appearance and voice. Hell, the whole band was in fighting trim, from drummer James Kottak to guitarists Matthias Jabs and Rudolf Schenker. Metal makes old bones, and metal rules\\". Alan Cox from Denver Post said about the concert in Greenwood Village on September 29, 2015 that \\"It was symbollic of how, despite the many years of playing, the band is still out on the road and still giving their fans what they want‚Äìto be rocked like a hurricane\\". Raymond Ahner from National Rock Review gave positive review about concert SAP Center at San Jose on October 1, 2015 stating that \\"it was clear that even after fifty years, the Scorpions still know what it takes to deliver a big arena rock show\\". Cassandra Miasnikov from Santa Barbara Independent praised the show in Santa Barbara Bowl on October 6, 2015 by saying \\"The Scorpions proved that they deserve every bit of credit they‚Äôve achieved as one of the most prominent and longest lasting rock bands in the world\\". 50th Anniversary World Tour was ranked by Pollstar at #79 at their \\"Top 100 Worldwide Tour\\" chart for 2015 with total gross of $22,400,000 and total of 375.576 tickets sold from 51 concerts. It was also ranged by Pollstar at #68 at their \\"Top 100 Worldwide Tour\\" chart for 2016 with total gross of $26,200,000 and total of 383.398 tickets sold from 59 concerts. ==Tour dates== {  style=\\"text-align:center;\\" ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:12em;\\" Date ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:10em;\\" City ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:10em;\\" Country ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:16em;\\" Venue ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:10em;\\" Opening acts ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:10em;\\" Attendance ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:10em;\\" Revenue -

Not a milestone in the genre, but adventure fans should give it a chance.\\". ===Episode 1=== Hardcore Gamer was less positive in its review for the first episode of the series, arguing \\"The first episode of Bear With Me still hints at a greater game to come, nicely setting a proper noir tone with some occasional creepy bits and a gleeful dose of snark throughout.\\", but \\"it sadly says a lot that the initial outing feels more like a demo for the game than an actual full-fledged chapter of the story.\\" LeveL magazine, on the other hand, gave it 8/10 and praised it as \\"The first episode of a dark adventure, where childlike elements are mixed with an adult story in a perfect harmony of a noir story\\". ===Bear With Me: The Complete Collection=== Bear With Me: The Complete Collection was published on July 31, 2019 for Xbox One, PlayStation 4, Nintendo Switch, and Microsoft Windows. == References  External links == * Bear with me website Category:2016 video games Category:Episodic video games Category:Indie video games Category:Point-and- click adventure games Category:Video games developed in Croatia Category:Windows games Category:Linux games Category:MacOS games ","title":"Bear With Me"},{"id":"56072949","text":"Mia Essa is a village council and union council in Mardan District of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. ==References== Category:Union councils of Mardan District Category:Populated places in Mardan District ","title":"Mia Essa"},{"id":"56072952","text":"Papa Ibrahima Ba (born 19 May 1946) is a Senegalese athlete.

Built in 1870 and extensively restyled in 1924, it is a rare example of Georgian Revival architecture in the downtown area, noted for its historical association with the Family Services Society, a prominent local charity. The building, now in other commercial use, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. ==Description and history== The Webster Memorial Building stands at the northeast corner of Trumbull and Jewell Streets on the west side of Hartford's downtown area, facing one of the main entrances to Bushnell Park. It is a three-story brick building, with a flat roof and decorative wooden carved cornice. The main facade is five bays wide, with most windows set in rectangular openings with brownstone sills and lintels. The main entrance is recessed in the center bay, framed by a projecting portico supported by paired Corinthian columns. The columns support a frieze in which the building name is carved, above which are a cornice and a step with a pair of urns. The bay above the entrance houses a window that is flanked by pilasters and topped by a broken segmented-arch pediment. The building was constructed in 1870, and was originally a private three-unit apartment house. Its design was in the then-popular Italianate style, with a bracketed cornice. In 1925 it was purchased by the Charity Organization Society, a philanthropic organization founded in 1890. The society's purchase was funded by a bequest from John Webster, a local insurance executive. The society undertook the remodelling of the building for its use, hiring the local firm of Allen and Collins, best known for their work on the Hartford Theological Seminary, who are credited with this building's present exterior appearance. The society, now known as the Family Services Society, has played a leading role in social service endeavours of other local charities since its inception. ==See also== *National Register of Historic Places listings in Hartford, Connecticut ==References== Category:Houses on the National Register of Historic Places in Connecticut Category:National Register of Historic Places in Hartford, Connecticut Category:Houses completed in 1870 Category:Houses in Hartford, Connecticut ","title":"Webster Memorial Building"},{"id":"56073002","text":"Shamozai is a union council in Swat District of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.

The work was commissioned by the conductor Serge Koussevitzky who was then music director of the Boston Symphony Orchestra. It was first performed on January 28, 1927, by the Boston Symphony Orchestra conducted by Koussevitzky with the composer himself as the soloist. The piece is dedicated to Copland's patron Alma Morgenthau Wertheim. ==CompositionBackground=== Copland completed work on the piano concerto in November 1926. It is cast in two connected movements: a short, slow first movement and a large, fast second movement. Like George Gershwin's Rhapsody in Blue (composed two years prior), the piece demonstrates an early use of jazz and blues in an orchestral setting. ===Instrumentation=== The work is scored for piano and a large orchestra consisting of two flutes, piccolo, two oboes, cor anglais, two clarinets, E-flat clarinet, bass clarinet, alto saxophone (doubling soprano saxophone), two bassoons, contrabassoon, four horns, three trumpets, three trombones, tuba, five percussionists, celesta, and strings. ==Reception== The piano concerto was not a critical success upon its premiere and remained virtually unperformed for three decades. The piece was nevertheless admired by the conductor Leonard Bernstein, who featured it in the New York Philharmonic's Young People's Concerts and later produced the first recording of the concerto with the New York Philharmonic and Copland again performing the piano part. The piece has since grown more popular and has been recorded many times. In 2008, the music critic Peter Dickinson of Gramophone reflected, \\"The first of its two movements is a spacious outpouring of fanfares and blues and the second is a crazy kind of supercharged ragtime that really upset the Boston audience and critics. It shows how Copland exploited the jazz age to brilliant effect.\\" ==References== Category:Compositions by Aaron Copland Category:1926 compositions Copland, Aaron Category:Jazz compositions Category:Music commissioned by Serge Koussevitzky or the Koussevitzky Music Foundation ","title":"Piano Concerto (Copland)"},{"id":"56073319","text":"Lyudmila Borsuk (born 28 April 1952) is a Belarusian athlete.

She made eight voyages for the British East India Company (EIC) between 1791 and 1811. She was sold and served for a while as a West Indiaman, transport, and storeship. Her hulk was sunk in 1829 to form a dry dock at Limehouse. She was finally broken up in 1898. ==Career== The EIC engaged Canton for six voyages, and then engaged her for an additional two voyages. ===EIC voyage #1 (1791‚Äì1792)=== Captain Thomas Bretrell sailed from The Downs on 27 January 1791, bound for Bombay and China. Canton reached Bombay on 23 May, and arrived at Whampoa Anchorage on 16 September. Homeward bound, she crossed the Second Bar on 23 November, reached St Helena on 2 March 1792, and arrived at Purfleet on 24 April. ===EIC voyage #2 (1794‚Äì1795)=== War with France had broken out before Cantons second voyage. Captain Thomas Bretrell acquired a letter of marque on 3 April 1794. The British government held Canton at Portsmouth, together with a number of other Indiamen in anticipation of using them as transports for an attack on √éle de France (Mauritus). It gave up the plan and released the vessels in May 1794. It paid ¬£430 for having delayed her departure by 16 days. Captain Betrell sailed from Portsmouth on 2 May 1794, bound for China. Canton arrived at Whampoa on 27 September. Homeward bound, she crossed the Second Bar on 26 November, reached St Helena on 15 April 1795, and arrived at Long Reach on 25 July. ===EIC voyage #3 (1796‚Äì1798)=== Captain Abel Vyvyan acquired a letter of marque on 11 February 1796. He sailed from Portsmouth on 12 April 1796, bound for St Helena, Madras, and China. Canton was at St Helena on 23 June, Madras on 1 September, Trincomalee on 24 October, and Colombo on 29 November. She joined at Colombo and together they awaited the arrival of , , , and , all of which had arrived by 9 December. They then set out together for Canton with Captain James Farquharson, pf Alfred, the senior captain, as commodore of the fleet. On 28 January 1797 the Indiamen had sailed through the Bali Strait in a squall and were off Java when they encountered six French frigates. Farquharson proceeded to organize a bluff. To give the impression that the convoy consisted of the powerful ships of the line that the Indiamen resembled, Farquharson ordered his ships to advance in line of battle. The French retreated, convinced they were facing a superior force. Actually, the French outgunned the East Indiamen both in terms of the number of guns and the weight of shot per gun. The Indiamen sailed east and then up towards China. On 1 February the Fleet encountered a strong gale with violent squalls and rain that wrecked Ocean. Canton arrived at Whampoa on 9 April 1797. The other four survivors of the incident at the Bali Strait arrived that day or the day before. Canton left Whampoa and crossed the Second Bar on 27 May. On 28 August she was at Amoy, and she returned to Whampoa on 24 September. Captain Vyvyan died on 12 October. Cantons first officer was Ethelbert Lyne, and he assumed command.List... (1896), p.72. Finally homeward bound, Canton crossed the Second Bar on 26 February 1798, reached St Helena on 5 August, and arrived at Long Reach on 23 October. ===EIC voyage #4 (1800‚Äì1801)=== Captain Thomas Lushington acquired a letter of marque on 4 December 1799. He sailed from Portsmouth on 7 January 1800, bound for Bombay and China. Canton was at Johanna on 2 May, and reached Bombay on 26 May. She left Bombay on 17 August and was at Malacca on 24 September and Singapore on 1 October. She arrived at Whampoa on 5 November. Homeward bound, she crossed the Second Bar on 29 December, reached St Helena on 16 April 1801, and arrived at Long Reach on 17 June. ===EIC voyage #5 (1802‚Äì1803)=== Captain Thomas Lushington sailed from Portsmouth on 12 February 1802, bound for Bombay and China. Canton reached Bombay on 11 June, was at Malacca on 5 September, and arrived at Whampoa on 27 September. Homeward bound, she crossed the Second Bar on 9 December, reached St Helena on 31 March 1803, and arrived at Long Reach on 2 June. ===EIC voyage #6 (1804‚Äì1805)=== Captain Lushington sailed from Portsmouth on 20 March 1804, bound for Ceylon and China. Canton was one of a convoy of eight East Indiamen, all under escort by . Other East Indiamen in the convoy included , , and . Canton reached Ceylon on 17 July. Four days later she was at Madras. She reached Penang on 27 August and Malacca on 14 September, before she arrived at Whampoa on 15 October. Homeward bound, she crossed the Second Bar on 15 December, was at Lintin Island on 2 January 1805 and Penang on 21 January. She reached St Helena on 2 April, but apparently did not leave until 11 July. She then arrived at Long Reach on 15 September. ===EIC voyage #7 (1808‚Äì1809)=== Captain John Christopher Lochner acquired a letter of marque on 16 January 1808. He sailed from Portsmouth on 5 March 1808, bound for China. Canton was at the Cape on 31 May, Madras on 3 August, Penang on 22 August, and Malacca on 6 September. She arrived at Whampoa on 6 October. Homeward bound, she crossed the Second Bar on 2 February 1809, was at Penang on 1 April, reached St Helena on 11 July, and arrived at Long Reach on 14 September. ===EIC voyage #8 (1810‚Äì1811)=== Captain George Gray acquired a letter of marque on 22 March 1810. He sailed from Portsmouth on 28 April, bound for China. Canton was at Penang on 5 September and Malacca on 26 September, before she arrived at Whampoa on 10 December. Homeward bound, she crossed the Second Bar on 9 February 1811, reached St Helena on 11 July and Carrig Roads on 18 September. She arrived at Northfleet on 29 September. ==Fate== In 1812 her owners sold Canton and she became a West Indiaman. Later she served as a transport and storeship until she was hulked. In 1829 the hulk was sunk to serve as a dry dock at Limehouse.New Yorker, Vol. 29, Issue 3, p.57. Joseph Fletcher, of the shipbuilders Fletcher. Son & Fearnall, sank Canton in the former mast pond. She was fastened with piles. He removed the decks, beams, and carlings, and replaced her stern with gates. Earth was placed around the hull with the result that she became an oak-lined dry dock of by . The work was completed by 1833. Fletcher used the dock of steamboats and so had recesses built in to the side walls to accommodate paddles.\\"Limehouse Hole: The riverside area.\\" Survey of London: Volumes 43 and 44, Poplar, Blackwall and Isle of Dogs.

Stability map of a hypothetical combustor. This combustor operates at conditions in which no dangerous combustion-instabilities will happen. In many practical cases, the appearance of combustion instabilities is undesirable. For instance, thermoacoustic instabilities are a major hazard to gas turbines and rocket engines. Moreover, flame blowoff of an aero-gas-turbine engine in mid-flight is clearly dangerous (see flameout). Because of these hazards, the engineering design process of engines involves the determination of a stability map (see figure). This process identifies a combustion-instability region and attempts to either eliminate this region or moved the operating region away from it. This is a very costly iterative process. For example, the numerous tests required to develop rocket engines are largely in part due to the need to eliminate or reduce the impact of thermoacoustic combustion instabilities. ==Classification of combustion instabilities== In applications directed towards engines, combustion instability has been classified into three categories, not entirely distinct. This classification was first introduced by Marcel Barr√®re and Forman A. Williams in 1969.Barrere, M., & Williams, F. A. (1969, January). Comparison of combustion instabilities found in various types of combustion chambers. In Symposium (International) on Combustion (Vol. 12, No. 1, pp. 169-181). Elsevier. The three categories areWilliams, Forman A. Combustion theory. CRC Press, 2018. * Chamber instabilities - instabilities arising due to the occurrence of combustion inside a chamber (acoustic instabilities, shock instabilities, fluid-dynamic instabilities associated with the chamber, etc.,) * Intrinsic instabilities - instabilities arising irrespective of whether combustion occurs inside a chamber or not (chemical-kinetic instabilities, diffusive-thermal instabilities, hydrodynamic instabilities, etc.,) * System instabilities - instabilities arising due to the interaction between combustion processes in the chamber and anywhere else in the system (feed-system interactions, exhaust-system interactions, etc.,) ==Thermoacoustic combustion instabilities== In this type of instabilities the perturbations that grow and alter the features of the flow are of an acoustics nature. Their associated pressure oscillations can have well defined frequencies with amplitudes high enough to pose a serious hazard to combustion systems. For example, in rocket engines, such as the Rocketdyne F-1 rocket engine in the Saturn V program, instabilities can lead to massive damage of the combustion chamber and surrounding components (see rocket engines). Furthermore, instabilities are known to destroy gas-turbine-engine components during testing. They represent a hazard to any type of combustion system. Thermoacoustic combustion instabilities can be explained by distinguishing the following physical processes: * the feedback between heat-release fluctuations (or flame fluctuations) with the combustor or combustion chamber acoustics * the coupling of these two processes in space-time * the strength of this coupling in comparison with acoustic losses * the physical mechanisms behind the heat- release fluctuations The simplest example of a thermoacoustic combustion instability is perhaps that happening in a horizontal Rijke tube (see also thermoacoustics): Consider the flow through a horizontal tube open at both ends, in which a flat flame sits at a distance of one-quarter the tube length from the leftmost end. In a similar way to an organ pipe, acoustic waves travel up and down the tube producing a particular pattern of standing waves. Such a pattern also forms in actual combustors, but takes a more complex form. The acoustic waves perturb the flame. In turn, the flame affects the acoustics. This feedback between the acoustic waves in the combustor and the heat-release fluctuations from the flame is a hallmark of thermoacoustic combustion instabilities. It is typically represented with a block diagram (see figure). Under some conditions, the perturbations will grow and then saturate, producing a particular noise. In fact, it is said that the flame of a Rijke tube sings. Combustion instabilities represented with a block diagram as a feedback amplifier. The conditions under which perturbations will grow are given by Rayleigh's (John William Strutt, 3rd Baron Rayleigh) criterion: Thermoacoustic combustion instabilities will occur if the volume integral of the correlation of pressure and heat-release fluctuations over the whole tube is larger than zero (see also thermoacoustics). In other words, instabilities will happen if heat-release fluctuations are coupled with acoustical pressure fluctuations in space-time (see figure). However, this condition is not sufficient for the instability to occur. Thermoacoustic combustion instabilities happening in a bluff-body-flame-stabilized combustor. Dark regions indicated strong release of heat, and large deformations indicated high pressure. Notice that whenever and wherever large deformations happen, dark regions are seen. This is the hallmark coupling of pressure and heat- release seen in thermoacoustic combustion instabilities. Another necessary condition for the establishment of a combustion instability is that the driving of the instability from the above coupling must be larger than the sum of the acoustic losses. These losses happen through the tube's boundaries, or are due to viscous dissipation. Combining the above two conditions, and for simplicity assuming here small fluctuations and an inviscid flow, leads to the extended Rayleigh's criterion. Mathematically, this criterion is given by the next inequality: \\\\int_{0}^{T} \\\\int_{V} p' q' dV dt > \\\\int_{0}^{T} \\\\int_{S} p' \\\\mathbf{u'} \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{n} dS dt . Here p' represents pressure fluctuations, q' heat release fluctuations, \\\\mathbf{u'} velocity fluctuations, T is a long enough time interval, V denotes volume, S surface, and \\\\mathbf{n} is a normal to the surface boundaries. The left hand side denotes the coupling between heat-release fluctuations and acoustic pressure fluctuations, and the right hand side represents the loss of acoustic energy at the tube boundaries. Graphical representation of the extended Rayleigh's criterion for some combustor showing a region where gains exceeds losses and the combustor response is strong. This suggests a strong likelihood of having a combustion instability. This figure is adapted from. Graphically, for a particular combustor, the extended Rayleigh's criterion is represented in the figure on the right as a function of frequency. The left hand side of the above inequality is called gains, and the right hand side losses. Notice that there is a region where the gains exceeds the losses. In other words, the above inequality is satisfied. Furthermore, note that in this region the response of the combustor to acoustic fluctuations peaks. Thus, the likelihood of a combustion instability in this region is high, making it a region to avoid in the operation of the combustor. This graphical representation of a hypothetical combustor allows to group three methods to prevent combustion instabilities: increase the losses; reduce the gains; or move the combustor's peak response away from the region where gains exceed losses. To clarify further the role of the coupling between heat-release fluctuations and pressure fluctuations in producing and driving an instability, it is useful to make a comparison with the operation of an internal combustion engine (ICE). In an ICE, a higher thermal efficiency is achieved by releasing the heat via combustion at a higher pressure. Likewise, a stronger driving of a combustion instability happens when the heat is released at a higher pressure. But while high heat release and high pressure coincide (roughly) throughout the combustion chamber in an ICE, they coincide at a particular region or regions during a combustion instability. Furthermore, whereas in an ICE the high pressure is achieved through mechanical compression with a piston or a compressor, in a combustion instability high pressure regions form when a standing acoustic wave is formed. The physical mechanisms producing the above heat-release fluctuations are numerous. Nonetheless, they can be roughly divided into three groups: heat-release fluctuations due to mixture inhomogeneities; those due to hydrodynamic instabilities; and, those due to static combustion instabilities. To picture heat-release fluctuations due to mixture inhomogeneities, consider a pulsating stream of gaseous fuel upstream of a flame-holder. Such a pulsating stream may well be produced by acoustic oscillations in the combustion chamber that are coupled with the fuel-feed system. Many other causes are possible. The fuel mixes with the ambient air in a way that an inhomogeneous mixture reaches the flame, e.g., the blobs of fuel-and-air that reach the flame could alternate between rich and lean. As a result, heat- release fluctuations occur. Heat-release fluctuations produced by hydrodynamic instabilities happen, for example, in bluff-body-stabilized combustors when vortices interact with the flame (see previous figure). Lastly, heat-release fluctuations due to static instabilities are related to the mechanisms explained in the next section. ==Static instability or flame blow-off== Flame from a swirl-stabilized, premixed, academic combustor undergoing blow-off. The flow is from right to left. The fuel-air ratio is decreased. This makes the flame to change its shape, then become unstable, and eventually blow-off. Static instability or flame blow-off refer to phenomena involving the interaction between the chemical composition of the fuel-oxidizer mixture and the flow environment of the flame. To explain these phenomena, consider a flame that is stabilized with swirl, as in a gas-turbine combustor, or with a bluff body. Moreover, say that the chemical composition and flow conditions are such that the flame is burning vigorously, and that the former is set by the fuel-oxidizer ratio (see air-fuel ratio) and the latter by the oncoming velocity. For a fixed oncoming velocity, decreasing the fuel-oxidizer ratio makes the flame change its shape, and by decreasing it further the flame oscillates or moves intermittently. In practice, these are undesirable conditions. Further decreasing the fuel-oxidizer ratio blows-off the flame. This is clearly an operational failure. For a fixed fuel-oxidizer ratio, increasing the oncoming velocity makes the flame behave in a similar way to the one just described. S-shape curve resulting from the solution of an homogeneous reactor model representing a flame. Even though the processes just described are studied with experiments or with Computational Fluid Dynamics, it is instructive to explain them with a simpler analysis. In this analysis, the interaction of the flame with the flow environment is modeled as a perfectly-mixed chemical reactor. With this model, the governing parameter is the ratio between a flow time-scale (or residence time in the reactor) and a chemical-time scale, and the key observable is the reactor's maximum temperature. The relationship between parameter and observable is given by the so-called S-shape curve (see figure). This curve results from the solution of the governing equations of the reactor model. It has three branches: an upper branch in which the flame is burning vigorously, i.e., it is \\"stable\\"; a middle branch in which the flame is \\"unstable\\" (the probability for solutions of the reactor-model equations to be in this unstable branch is small); and a lower branch in which there is no flame but a cold fuel-oxidizer mixture. The decrease of the fuel-oxidizer ratio or increase of oncoming velocity mentioned above correspond to a decrease of the ratio of the flow and chemical time scales. This in turn corresponds to a movement towards the left in the S-shape curve. In this way, a flame that is burning vigorously is represented by the upper branch, and its blow-off is the movement towards the left along this branch towards the quenching point Q. Once this point is passed, the flame enters the middle branch, becoming thus \\"unstable\\", or blows off. This is how this simple model captures qualitatively the more complex behavior explained in the above example of a swirl or bluff-body-stabilized flame. ==Intrinsic flame instabilities== In contrast with thermoacoustic combustion instabilities, where the role of acoustics is dominant, intrinsic flame instabilities refer to instabilities produced by differential and preferential diffusion, thermal expansion, buoyancy, and heat losses. Examples of these instabilities include the Darrieus‚ÄìLandau instability, the Rayleigh-Taylor instability, and thermal-diffusive instabilities (see Double diffusive convection). == References == Category:Combustion ","title":"Combustion instability"},{"id":"56073416","text":"The Greenwood Academies Trust is a large multi-academy trust in England, centred around the Nottingham Academy, which was formerly the Greenwood Dale School.

It lies near Horressen in the county of Westerwaldkreis in the German state of Rhineland-Palatinate. Together with the K√∂ppel and the Lippersberg, the Alarmstange forms the centre of the ridge, on which is the largest contiguous woodland area in the Westerwald. == Name == Historical trigonometric point The Alarmstange owes its name to the fact that in 1809 French soldiers built an optical signal station there. In 1853, a post was erected that acted as a trigonometric point for the surveying of the Rhineland which was begun by Jean Joseph Tranchot and continued by Friedrich Carl Ferdinand von M√ºffling. From 1894 it was used for the Prussian state survey. The post was moved in 1969 by around five metres and, in its place, a granite post was erected. == Geography  Location === The Alarmstange stands within the Nassau Nature Park. The boundary of the borough of Montabaur, whose town lies 7 km ENE of the summit, with the municipality of Hillscheid, whose village is 3.5 km SW, runs from northwest via west to southwest around the summit region which belongs to the borough of Montabaur. To the east-northeast the countryside transitions to the K√∂ppel, which is around 1.5 km away. Two streams rise on the hill's north flank, the Vorderste Bach and the Hinterste Bach, both headstreams of the Brexbach. On the southern slopes is the source of the Biebrichsbach, a headstream of the Stadtbach. To the south the Wolfsborn is the sources of the little Wolfsgraben, which discharges into the Kalterbach, as does the little Alsbach, which rises to the southwest. On the western hillside is the source of the Feisternachtbach (K√ºhlbach). On the summit region and southern flank of the Alarmstange are parts of a Special Area of Conservation, the Montabauer Heights (Montabaurer H√∂he, FFH no. 5512-301; 28.11 km¬≤). === Natural regions === The Alarmstange lies within the natural region major unit group of the Westerwald (no. 32), in the major of the Lower Westerwald (324) and in the subunit of the Montabaur Heights (324.1). === Height === The Alarmstange is 545.2 m. Roughly 150 metres southwest of the summit on topographical maps is a spot height of 542.5 m. Atlases and larger maps give its height as 545 m or 546 m. == Telecommunication towers and survey station == About 130 metres southwest of the summit of the Alarmstange stands the99-metre-high Hillscheid-Alarmstange Tower built in 1971.() belonging to Deutsche Funkturm with its amateur radio relay repeater. 150 metres west of this tower is the air quality survey station of Neuh√§usel, which is part of the ZIMEN network of the State Office for the Environment, Water and Trade. About 20 metres west of the summit is another telecommunication tower. == Transport and hiking == The Landesstra√üe 309 and German Limes Road run over the southern slopes of the Montabaur Heights and the Alarmstange between Hillscheid and the Bundesstra√üe 49, roughly from west to east. it runs near the Wolfsgraben at about 420 m and meets the B 49 at 424.3 m. The E1 European long distance path runs over the Montabaur Heights and the K√∂ppel east of the Alarmstange. On the western hillside of the Alarmstange, next to a forest track and hiking trail fork (499.2 m) is the refuge hut of Thielsh√ºtte built in 1967. == References == Alarmstange und K√∂ppel in K√∂ppel, auf ich-geh-wandern.de Informationstafel Trigonometrischer Punkt \\"Montabaurer H√∂he\\" auf der Alarmstange neben dem Pfeiler Heinrich M√ºller-Miny, Martin B√ºrgener: Geographische Landesaufnahme: Die naturr√§umlichen Einheiten auf Blatt 138 Koblenz.

It was one of several thousand Sumerian tablets found by archeologists during excavations between 1889 and 1900. The tablet was identified among 74000 others and translated by Samuel Noah Kramer in 1951, during his years of studies in the Istanbul Museum. Kramer was deciding what works to translate next when he found the tablet in the museum drawer. He describes the moment in his book History Begins at Sumer:Joshua J. Mark.

Composed of 29 lines,The 30th line on the tablet contains a subscript: \\"It is a balbale of Inana\\". this poem is a monologue directed to king Shu-Sin (ruled 1972-1964 BC, short chronology, or 2037-2029 BC, long chronology). In erotic language, the female speaker in the poem expresses her ardent desires and longings for Shu-Sin, drawing heavily on imagery related to honey and sweetness. The following is the start of the poem (in Kramer's translation): : Bridegroom, dear to my heart, : Goodly is your beauty, honeysweet, : Lion, dear to my heart, : Goodly is your beauty, honeysweet. The last three lines of the poem seem to contain an invitation to a sexual encounter, but in language not adequately clear to us. The text is one of the oldest known lyric poems. == Interpretations == It is believed that the poem is a script for the yearly \\"sacred marriage\\", a rite in which the king would symbolically marry the goddess Inanna, mate with her, and ensure fertility and prosperity for the coming year. A priestess would probably represent Inanna, the Sumerian goddess of fertility, and the king Shu-Sin would represent Dumuzi, the god of shepherds, on the eve of their union. Variants of the poem may have been sung during ritual ceremonies commemorating the divine marriage between the two gods all over the ancient Near East, particularly in Egypt. The translation of this tablet shed light on the Song of Solomon in the Old Testament, because some phrases are similar to the poems sung during such fertility feasts, as well as Sumerian weddings.Sebnem Arsu.

The language combines ideas primarily from the functional and imperative paradigms, and includes limited support for object-oriented programming. Features include generic classes, dynamic allocation, inductive datatypes and a variation of separation logic known as implicit dynamic frames for reasoning about side effects. Dafny was created by Rustan Leino at Microsoft Research after his previous work on developing ESC/Modula-3, ESC/Java, and Spec#. Dafny is been used widely in teaching and features regularly in software verification competitions (e.g. VSTTE'08, VSCOMP'10, COST'11, and VerifyThis'12). Dafny was designed to provide a simple introduction to formal specification and verification and has been used widely in teaching. Dafny builds on the Boogie intermediate language which uses the Z3 automated theorem prover for discharging proof obligations. ==Data types== Dafny provides methods for implementation which may have side-effects and functions for use in specification which are pure. Methods consist of sequences of statements following a familiar imperative style whilst, in contrast, the body of a function is simply an expression. Any side-effecting statements in a method (e.g. assigning an element of an array parameter) must be accounted for by noting which parameters can be mutated in the \`modifies\` clause. Dafny also provides a range of immutable collection types including: sequences (e.g. \`seq<int>\`), sets (e.g. \`set<int>\`) and maps (\`map<int,int>\`). In addition, mutable arrays (e.g. \`array<int>\`) are provided. ==Imperative features== Dafny supports proofs of imperative programs based on the ideas of Hoare logic. The following illustrates many such features in Dafny, including the use of preconditions, postconditions, loop invariants and loop variants. method max(arr:array) returns(max:int) // Array must have at least one element requires arr!=null && arr.Length > 0; // Return cannot be smaller than any element in array ensures (forall j :int :: (j >= 0 && j < arr.Length ==> max >= arr[j])); // Return must match some element in array ensures (exists j : int :: j>=0 && j < arr.Length && max==arr[j]); { max:=arr[0]; var i:int :=1; // while(i < arr.Length) // Indent at most arr.Length (needed to show i==arr.Length after loop) invariant (i<=arr.Length); // No element seen so far larger than max invariant (forall j:int :: j>=0 && j _max >= arr[j]); // Some element seen so far matches max invariant (exists j:int :: j>=0 && j _max){max := arr[i];} // Continue through array i := i + 1; } } This examples computes the maximum element of an array. The method's precondition and postcondition are given with the \`requires\` and \`ensures\` clauses (respectively). Likewise, the loop invariant and loop variant are given through the \`invariant\` and \`decreases\` clauses (respectively). ==Loop invariants== The treatment of loop invariants in Dafny differs from traditional Hoare logic. Variables mutated in a loop are treated such that (most) information known about them prior to the loop is discarded. Information required to prove properties of such variables must be expressed explicitly in the loop invariant. In contrast, variables not mutated in the loop retain all information known about them beforehand. The following provides illustrates: method sumAndZero(ns:array) returns (sum:nat) requires ns != null requires forall i :: 0 <= i < ns.Length ==> ns[i] >= 0 modifies ns { var i:int := 0; var arr:array := ns; // because parameters cannot be assigned sum := 0; // while(i < arr.Length) { sum := sum + arr[i]; arr[i] := arr[i]; i := i + 1; } } This fails verification because Dafny cannot establish that \`(sum + arr[i]) >= 0\` holds at the assignment. From the precondition, intuitively, \`forall i :: 0 <= i < arr.Length ==> arr[i] >= 0\` holds in the loop since \`arr[i] := arr[i];\` is a NOP. However, this assignment causes Dafny to treat \`arr\` as a mutable variable and drop information known about it from before the loop. To verify this program in Dafny we can either: remove the redundant assignment \`arr[i] := arr[i];\`; or, add the loop invariant \`invariant forall i :: 0 <= i < arr.Length ==> arr[i] >= 0\` Dafny additionally employs limited static analysis to infer simple loop invariants where possible. In the example above, it would seem the loop invariant \`invariant i >= 0\` is also required as variable \`i\` is mutated within the loop. Whilst the underlying logic does require such an invariant, Dafny automatically infers this and, hence, it can be omitted at the source level. ==Proof features== Dafny includes features which further support its use as a proof assistant. Whilst proofs of simple properties within a \`function\` or \`method\` (as shown above) are not unusual for tools of this nature, Dafny also allows the proof of properties between one \`function\` and another. As is common for a proof assistant, such proofs are often inductive in nature. Dafny is perhaps unusual in employing method invocation as a mechanism for applying the inductive hypothesis. The following illustrates: datatype List = Nil  Link(data:int,next:List) function sum(l:List): int { match l case Nil => 0 case Link(d,n) => d + sum(n) } predicate isNatList(l:List) { match l case Nil => true case Link(d,n) => d >= 0 && isNatList(n) } ghost method NatSumLemma(l:List, n:int) requires isNatList(l) && n == sum(l) ensures n >= 0 { match l case Nil => // Discharged Automatically case Link(data,next) => { // Apply Inductive Hypothesis NatSumLemma(next,sum(next)); // Check what known by Dafny assert data >= 0; } } Here, \`NatSumLemma\` proves a useful property between \`sum()\` and \`isNatList()\` (i.e. that \`isNatList(l) ==> (sum(l) >= 0)\`). The use of a \`ghost method\` for encoding lemmas and theorems is standard in Dafny with recursion employed for induction (typically, structural induction). Case analysis is performed using \`match\` statements and non- inductive cases are often discharged automatically. The verifier must also have complete access to the contents of a \`function\` or \`predicate\` in order to unroll them as necessary. This has implications when used in conjunction with access modifiers. Specifically, hiding the contents of a \`function\` using the \`protected\` modifier can limit what properties can be established about it. ==References *Dafny: A Language and Program Verifier for Functional Correctness - Microsoft Research *GitHub - dafny-lang/dafny: Dafny is a verification-aware programming language Category:Academic programming languages Category:Experimental programming languages Category:Microsoft free software Category:Microsoft Research Category:Proof assistants Category:Software using the MIT license Category:Statically typed programming languages ","title":"Dafny"},{"id":"56073624","text":"Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency.

Robert M. Solovay initially announced the result on an email list in 1995, and Alexei Kitaev independently gave an outline of its proof in 1997. Christopher M. Dawson and Michael Nielsen call the theorem one of the most important fundamental results in the field of quantum computation. A consequence of this theorem is that a quantum circuit of m constant-qubit gates can be approximated to \\\\varepsilon error (in operator norm) by a quantum circuit of O(m\\\\log^c(m/\\\\varepsilon)) gates from a desired finite universal gate set. By comparison, just knowing that a gate set is universal only implies that constant-qubit gates can be approximated by a finite circuit from the gate set, with no bound on its length. So, the Solovay-Kitaev theorem shows that this approximation can be made surprisingly efficient, thereby justifying that quantum computers need only implement a finite number of gates to gain the full power of quantum computation. == Statement == Let \\\\mathcal{G} be a finite set of elements in SU(2) containing its own inverses (so g \\\\in \\\\mathcal{G} implies g^{-1} \\\\in \\\\mathcal{G}) and such that the group \\\\langle \\\\mathcal{G} \\\\rangle they generate is dense in SU(2). Consider some \\\\varepsilon > 0. Then there is a constant c such that for any U \\\\in SU(2), there is a sequence S of gates from \\\\mathcal{G} of length O(\\\\log^c(1/\\\\varepsilon)) such that \\\\S - U\\\\ \\\\leq \\\\varepsilon. That is, S approximates U to operator norm error. == Quantitative bounds == The constant c can be made to be 3+\\\\delta for any fixed \\\\delta > 0. However, there exist particular gate sets for which we can take c=1, which makes the length of the gate sequence tight up to a constant factor. == Proof idea == The proof of the Solovay-Kitaev theorem proceeds by recursively constructing a gate sequence giving increasingly good approximations to U \\\\in \\\\operatorname{SU}(2). Suppose we have an approximation U_{n-1} \\\\in \\\\operatorname{SU}(2) such that \\\\ U - U_{n-1} \\\\ \\\\leq \\\\varepsilon_{n-1}. Our goal is to find a sequence of gates approximating U U_{n-1}^{-1} to \\\\varepsilon_n error, for \\\\varepsilon_n < \\\\varepsilon_{n-1}. By concatenating this sequence of gates with U_{n-1}, we get a sequence of gates U_n such that \\\\U - U_n\\\\ \\\\leq \\\\varepsilon_n. The key idea is that commutators of elements close to the identity can be approximated \\"better-than-expected\\". Specifically, for V,W \\\\in \\\\operatorname{SU}(2) satisfying \\\\V - I\\\\ \\\\leq \\\\delta_1 and \\\\W - I\\\\ \\\\leq \\\\delta_1 and approximations \\\\tilde{V}, \\\\tilde{W} \\\\in \\\\operatorname{SU}(2) satisfying \\\\V - \\\\tilde{V}\\\\ \\\\leq \\\\delta_2 and \\\\W - \\\\tilde{W}\\\\ \\\\leq \\\\delta_2, then :\\\\VWV^{-1}W^{-1} - \\\\tilde{V}\\\\tilde{W}\\\\tilde{V}^{-1}\\\\tilde{W}^{-1}\\\\ \\\\leq O(\\\\delta_1\\\\delta_2), where the big O notation hides higher-order terms. One can naively bound the above expression to be O(\\\\delta_2), but the group commutator structure creates substantial error cancellation. We use this observation by rewriting the expression we wish to approximate as a group commutator U U_{n-1}^{-1} = V_{n-1}W_{n-1}V_{n-1}^{-1}W_{n-1}^{-1}. This can be done such that both V_{n-1} and W_{n-1} are close to the identity (since \\\\U U_{n-1}^{-1} - I\\\\ \\\\leq \\\\varepsilon_{n-1}). So, if we recursively compute gate sequences approximating V_{n-1} and W_{n-1} to \\\\varepsilon_{n-1} error, we get a gate sequence approximating U U_{n-1}^{-1} to the desired better precision \\\\varepsilon_n with \\\\varepsilon_n. We can get a base case approximation with constant \\\\varepsilon_0 by brute-force computation of all sufficiently long gate sequences. == References == Category:Mathematical theorems Category:Quantum computing Category:Quantum information theory ","title":"Solovay‚ÄìKitaev theorem"},{"id":"56073673","text":"WVES may refer to: * WVES (FM), a radio station (101.5 FM) licensed to serve Chincoteague, Virginia, United States * WOWZ-FM, a radio station (99.3 FM) licensed to serve Accomac, Virginia, which held the call sign WVES from 1990 to 2017 ","title":"WVES"},{"id":"56073684","text":"The 1966‚Äì67 Botola is the 11th season of the Moroccan Premier League.

The game is described as a \\"prison riot survival game\\" and will feature an open world. It entered Steam's early access program on 29 August 2018, with a full release scheduled for sometime in 2020. The game uses Unreal Engine 4. ==Gameplay== The gameplay takes place in Croatia where up to 100 players per server will attempt to survive and get off the island by first removing the implant which prevents them from leaving. The player will earn fame points through participation in various action-driven events or simply by surviving in a hostile environment. These fame points allow the player to be cloned back in case of death, and used as currency to purchase or trade in various safe zones. Players will be able to fortify existing structures and points in order to secure positions or store items when needed. The player character will possess four main attributes: strength, dexterity, constitution and intelligence. These will let players create characters to suit their playing style of preference. It promises to simulate the human body, and as such uses a special interface connected to the player's \\"BCU monitor\\" which tracks character's calories, vitamins, health and other stats. Players can choose to ignore these elements of the game, or can delve deep into these systems in order to improve the character's performance (speed, stamina, weight to carry etc.). Another aspect is digestion; for instance, if a character gets all of their teeth knocked out, they will have to find a way to liquify food in order to digest it. Defecating and urinating will leave physical evidence of activities on the island, which could be used to track another player. Things like combat will depend on the player's skill level, but also on things like stamina, health and so on. Wetness, smell, medicine, cooking, hacking, crafting, hunting and poison will also play a major role in the gameplay. The game will offer both third and first-person perspectives, from which the player can alternate, but will prevent third-person peeking by hiding anything a character cannot see. ==Development== Scum was first announced in August 2016. The game was released into early access on August 29, 2018, and is planned to be fully released in 2020. ==Reception== The game was named as one of the best indie games of PAX East 2018 by Game Informer. It received similar attention from GameSpot, listing it as among the most noteworthy games of PAX East 2018. The game sold over 250,000 copies within its first 24 hours in early access, 700,000 in its first week, and over one million sales by the third week. ==References * Category:Upcoming video games scheduled for 2020 Category:Early access video games Category:Multiplayer video games Category:Open world video games Category:Survival video games Category:Tactical shooter video games Category:Third-person shooters Category:Unreal Engine games Category:Video games developed in Croatia Category:Video games set on fictional islands Category:Windows games Category:Windows-only games Category:Devolver Digital games Category:Video games set in Croatia ","title":"Scum (video game)"},{"id":"56073767","text":"Amity University may refer to one of several universities in India: * Amity University, Gurgaon, in Haryana * Amity University, Gwalior, in Madhya Pradesh * Amity University, Jaipur, in Rajasthan * Amity University, Jharkhand, in Ranchi, Jharkhand * Amity University, Kolkata, in West Bengal * Amity University, Mumbai, in Maharashtra * Amity University, Noida, in Uttar Pradesh * Amity University, Patna, in Bihar * Amity University, Raipur, in Chhattisgarh == See also== * Amity (disambiguation) ","title":"Amity University"},{"id":"56073783","text":"The 1968‚Äì69 Botola is the 13th season of the Moroccan Premier League.

The feature that makes this brand unique is that it uses special Ravnjak type tobacco, instead of traditional Virginia or Burley type tobacco like most brands. ==Markets== Drina was or still is being sold in the following countries: Switzerland, Austro-Hungarian rule in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kingdom of Yugoslavia, Yugoslavia, Socialist Republic of Croatia, Socialist Republic of Serbia, Serbia and Montenegro, Serbia, Socialist Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina and Bosnia and Herzegovina. ==Variants== Drina, a current pack with a warning label in Bosnian, Croatian and Serbian * Drina Denifine * Drina Jedina * Drina Gold * Drina Silver Below are all the current brands of Drina cigarettes sold, with the levels of tar, nicotine and carbon monoxide included. { border=\\"2\\" cellpadding=\\"4\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" style=\\"margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 95%;text-align:center\\" - style=\\"background: #ccccff;\\" PackTarNicotineCarbon monoxide - Drina Denifine  10 mg  0,9 mg  10 mg - Drina Jedina  10 mg  0,8 mg  10 mg - Drina Gold  8 mg  0,6 mg  10 mg - Drina Silver  4 mg  0,4 mg  6 mg - } ==See also== * Cigarette * Tobacco smoking * Jadran (cigarette) ==References== Category:Cigarette brands ","title":"Drina (cigarette)"},{"id":"56073869","text":"The Edinburgh Obstetrical Society is a medical society in Edinburgh devoted to obstetrics. It was founded in 1840 by Robert Bowes Malcolm and boasts James Young Simpson as their most eminent past member. == Origins == The society was established by Robert Bowes Malcolm in 1840 and is the oldest obstetrical society in the UK. Simpson was a pre-eminent founding member in the history of the society. Dr William Beilby took first presidency, which lasted the customary two years. Other presidents included Charles Bell, John Burn, Sir Alexander Russell Simpson, Sir John Halliday Croom and Ernest Fahmy. Numerous presidents have been pioneers in obstetric history, including creators of forceps, Robert Milne Murray and James Haig Ferguson and a founder of antenatal care, John William Ballantyne. == Simpson and society == James Young Simpson, c. 1843-47. Robert Adamson & David Octavius Hill Sir James Young Simpson, 1811 - 1870. Discoverer of chloroform. National Galleries of Scotland. Retrieved 11 January 2018. The society's longest running president was James Young Simpson, who was elected in 1841 at the age of 30. He continued in this role for the next 16 years and in 1866, returned to serve another year. His innovations in anaesthetics and properties of chloroform in November 1847 overshadowed his contributions to obstetrics. Simpson used ether to relieve labour pains, to the appreciation of many women but the disapproval of some contemporaries and the church. == Awards == Acknowledgements were made to obstetricians from around the world in the form of honorary fellowships. Thomas Cullen, Howard Kelly of Baltimore and Albert D√∂derlein of Munich were awarded such fellowships, as was Vasili Vasilievich Stroganoff of Leningrad. The inventor of the retractor, Doyen, and the pioneer of the antenatal stethoscope, Adolphe Pinard, also became fellows. == Transactions of the society == The Transactions were published in bound volumes until 1938. By that time, 733 fellows had been elected. Gustavus Murray, one of the role models for Luke Fildes painting, The Doctor, made contributions to the journal in its early days. ==Today== The society continues today, and is associated with the University of Edinburgh. ==References== Category:1840 establishments in Scotland Category:Scottish medical associations Category:University of Edinburgh Category:Obstetrics and gynaecology organizations Category:Organizations established in 1840 Category:Fellows of the Edinburgh Obstetrical Society ","title":"Edinburgh Obstetrical Society"},{"id":"56073897","text":"Brownwood Park is a 12.33-acre community park located within the East Atlanta neighborhood of Atlanta, Georgia.

Horizontal gene transfer is universal in fungi, viruses, bacteria, and other eukaryotes. Horizontal gene transfer research often focuses on prokaryotes because of the abundant sequence data from diverse lineages, and because it is assumed not to play a significant role in eukaryotes. Most plant‚Äìfungus horizontal gene transfer events are ancient and rare, but they may have provided important gene functions leading to wider substrate use and habitat spread for plants and fungi. Since these events are rare and ancient, they have been difficult to detect and remain relatively unknown. Plant‚Äìfungus interactions could play a part in a multi-horizontal gene transfer pathway among many other organisms. == Mechanisms == Fungus‚Äìplant-mediated horizontal gene transfer can occur via phagotrophic mechanisms (mediated by phagotrophic eukaryotes) and nonphagotropic mechanisms. Nonphagotrophic mechanisms have been seen in the transmission of transposable elements, plastid-derived endosymbiotic gene transfer, prokaryote-derived gene transfer, Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated DNA transfer, cross-species hybridization events, and gene transfer between mitochondrial genes. Horizontal gene transfer could bypass eukaryotic barrier features like linear chromatin-based chromosomes, intron‚Äìexon gene structures, and the nuclear envelope. Horizontal gene transfer occurs between microorganisms sharing overlapping ecological niches and associations like parasitism or symbiosis. Ecological association can facilitate horizontal gene transfer in plants and fungi and is an unstudied factor in shared evolutionary histories. Most horizontal gene transfers from fungi into plants predate the rise of land plants. A greater genomic inventory of gene family and taxon sampling has been identified as a desirable prerequisite for identifying further plant‚Äìfungus events. == Indicators of past horizontal gene transfer == Evidence for gene transfer between fungi and eukaryotes is discovered indirectly. Evidence is found in the unusual features of genetic elements. These features include: inconsistency between phylogeny across genetic elements, high DNA or amino acid similarity from phylogenetically distant organisms, irregular distribution of genetic elements in a variety of species, similar genes shared among species within a specific habitat or geography independent of their phylogenetic relationship, and gene characteristics inconsistent with the resident genome such as high guanine and cytosine content, codon usage, and introns. Alternative hypotheses and explanations for such findings include erroneous species phylogenies, inappropriate comparison of paralogous sequences, sporadic retention of shared ancestral characteristics, uneven rates of character change in other lineages, and introgressive hybridization. The \\"complexity hypothesis\\" is a different approach to understanding why informational genes have less success in being transferred than operational genes. It has been proposed that informational genes are part of larger, more conglomerate systems, while operational genes are less complex, allowing them to be horizontally transferred at higher frequencies. The hypothesis incorporates the \\"continual hypothesis\\", which states that horizontal gene transfer is constantly occurring in operational genes. == Examples  Horizontal gene transfer as a multi-vector pathway === Plant‚Äìfungus horizontal gene transfer could take place during plant infection. There are many possible vectors, such as plant‚Äìfungus‚Äìinsect interactions. The ability for fungi to infect other organisms provides this possible pathway. === In rice === A fungus‚Äìplant pathway has been demonstrated in rice (Oryza sativa) through ancestral lineages. A phylogeny was constructed from 1689 identified genes and all homologs available from the rice genome (3177 gene families). Fourteen candidate plant‚Äìfungus horizontal gene transfer events were identified, nine of which showed infrequent patterns of transfer between plants and fungi. From the phylogenetic analysis, horizontal gene transfer events could have contributed to the L-fucose permease sugar transporter, zinc binding alcohol dehydrogenase, membrane transporter, phospholipase/carboxylesterase, iucA/iucC family protein in siderophore biosynthesis, DUF239 domain protein, phosphate-response 1 family protein, a hypothetical protein similar to zinc finger (C2H2-type) protein, and another conserver hypothetical protein. === Ancestral shikimate pathway === Some plants may have obtained the shikimate pathway from symbiotic fungi. Plant shikimate pathway enzymes share similarities to prokaryote homologs and could have ancestry from a plastid progenitor genome. It is possible that the shikimate pathway and the pentafunctional arom have their ancient origins in eukaryotes or were conveyed by eukaryote‚Äìeukaryote horizontal gene transfer. The evolutionary history of the pathway could have been influenced by a prokaryote-to-eukaryote gene transfer event. Ascomycete fungi along with zygomycetes, basidiomycetes, apicomplexa, ciliates, and oomycetes retained elements of an ancestral pathway given through the bikont/unikont eukaryote root. === Ancestral land plants === Fungi and bacteria could have contributed to the phenylpropanoid pathway in ancestral land plants for the synthesis of flavonoids and lignin through horizontal gene transfer. Phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL) is known to be present in fungi, such as Basidiomycota yeast like Rhodotorula and Ascomycota such as Aspergillus and Neurospora. These fungi participate in the catabolism of phenylalanine for carbon and nitrogen. PAL in some plants and fungi also has a tyrosine ammonia lyase (TAL) for the synthesis of p-coumaric acid into p-coumaroyl-CoA. PAL likely emerged from bacteria in an antimicrobial role. Horizontal gene transfer took place through a pre-Dikarya divergent fungal lineage and a Nostocale or soil-sediment bacterium through symbiosis. The fungal PAL was then transferred to an ancestor of a land plant by an ancient arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis that later developed in the phenylpropanoid pathway and land plant colonization. PAL enzymes in early bacteria and fungi could have contributed to protection against ultraviolet radiation, acted as a light capturing pigment, or assisted in antimicrobial defense. === Gene transfer for enhanced intermediate and secondary metabolism === Sterigmatocystin gene transfer has been observed with Podospora anserina and Aspergillus. Horizontal gene transfer in Aspergillus and Podospora contributed to fungal metabolic diversity in secondary metabolism. Aspergillus nidulans produces sterigmatocystin ‚Äì a precursor to aflatoxins. Aspergillus was found to have horizontally transferred genes to Podospora anserina. Podospora and Aspergillus show high conservation and microsynteny sterigmatocystin/aflatoxin clusters along with intergenic regions containing 14 binding sites for AfIR, a transcription factor for the activation of sterigmatocystin/aflatoxin biosynthetic genes. Aspergillus to Podospora represents a large metabolic gene transfer which could have contributed to fungal metabolic diversity. Transposable elements and other mobile genetic elements like plasmids and viruses could allow for chromosomal rearrangement and integration of foreign genetic material. Horizontal gene transfer could have significantly contributed to fungal genome remodeling and metabolic diversity. === Acquired pathogenic capabilities === In Stagonospora and Pyrenophora, as well as in Fusarium and Alternaria, horizontal gene transfer provides a powerful mechanism for fungi to acquire pathogenic capabilities to infect a new host plant. Horizontal gene transfer and interspecific hybridization between pathogenic species allow for hybrid offspring with an expanded host range. This can cause disease outbreaks on new crops when an encoded protein is able to cause pathogenicity. The interspecific transfer of virulence factors in fungal pathogens has been shown between Stagonospora modorum and Pyrenophora tritici-repentis, where a host- selective toxin from S. nodorum conferred virulence to P. tritici-repentis on wheat. In Fusarium, a nonpathogenic strain was experimentally converted into a pathogen and could have contributed to pathogen adaption in large genome portions. Fusarium graminearum, Fusarium verticilliodes, and Fusarium oxysprorum are maize and tomato pathogens that produce fumonisin mycotoxins that contaminate grain. These examples highlight the apparent polyphyletic origins of host specialization and the emergence of new pathogenic lineages distinct from genetic backgrounds. The ability to transfer genetic material could increase disease in susceptible plant populations. == References == Category:Genetics Category:Microbial population biology ","title":"Plant‚Äìfungus horizontal gene transfer"},{"id":"56073967","text":" The Dzia≈Çowski D.K.D.1 was the first powered aircraft designed by Stanislaw Dzia≈Çowski. It was a low-power high-wing monoplane with a cabin for one passenger. After attending an aviation exhibition in Warsaw in 1927 it was badly damaged when the engine failed as it left and it did not fly again. ==Design and development== In the early 1920s Stanis≈Çaw Dzia≈Çowski was head of aircraft assembly at the military flying school at Bydgoszcz. He and his brother Mieczys≈Çaw began aircraft design with a glider, the Bydgodaszczanka, which flew at the 1925 Second Polish Glider Contest. In the same year they began work on the D.K.D.1. The surname initials D.K.D were those of the two brothers and of Jan Kruger, a local shoemaker who provided some funding and also bought the Gabriel brothers the Haacke engine that had been used in the Gabriel P 5 and P 6. The wing was built in the military workshop but they were later forced out to a cellar in the town. The D.K.D.1 was a high wing aircraft with an enclosed cabin for one passenger and an open cockpit for the pilot. It had a one-piece wooden wing of trapezoidal plan with an unswept leading edge, built around two spars and fabric covered. The wing was braced with V-struts from the lower fuselage longerons to the spars. The aircraft first flew with the wing centrally fixed directly to the top of the fuselage but flight testing revealed poor forward visibility from the cockpit and the wing was raised a short distance on four vertical, faired struts, allowing the pilot to look forward under the wing. There was a large, deep cut-out in the trailing edge over the cockpit. The generous balances on its ailerons extended beyond the squared wing tips. The D.K.D.1 was powered by a Haacke HFM-2 air-cooled flat twin engine mounted onto the rectangular section steel tube fuselage frame under single-curvature duralumin sheet, with its cylinder heads exposed for cooling. Behind it the deep, flat-sided fuselage was fabric covered apart from its rounded, plywood covered decking. The enclosed, single seat passenger cabin was immediately behind the engine and ahead of the cockpit. It had a small window on each side and was entered by a port-side door. Both fin and tailplane, the latter located on top of the fuselage, were small and rectangular in shape, mounting large, balanced control surfaces. These were also approximately rectangular but the bottom of the rudder was cut at an angle to allow the one-piece elevator to operate. All the rear surfaces were wooden framed and fabric covered. Its undercarriage was fixed and of the tailskid type, with mainwheels with rubber cord shock absorbers on a single axle. The axle was mounted on short steel tube V-struts hinged from the lower fuselage longerons, with further steel struts from both the longerons and central fuselage underside to the axle's centre. ==Operational history== The D.K.D.1 first flew in February 1926, piloted by Mu≈õlewski and the early tests led to the raising of the wing noted above and to other changes to the centre- section. Its designer also flew it and in late April 1927 took it to an aviation exhibition held in Warsaw. His , bad weather leg from Toru≈Ñ to Warsaw has been reported as \\"the first long cross-country flight to be made on a Polish-designed lightplane\\". Their earlier base at Bydgodaszcz had become unreceptive to civilian flying but another regiment at Krak√≥w was much more sympathetic, so he attempted to take the D.K.D.1 there. Early in the flight the old Haacke engine failed and the D.K.D.1 was badly damaged in the emergency landing. Its remains were taken to Krak√≥w and parts of it were used in the group's next aircraft, the D.K.D.3. ==SpecificationsReferences== Category:Single-engined tractor aircraft Category:High-wing aircraft Category:1920s Polish sport aircraft Category:Aircraft first flown in 1926 ","title":"Dzia≈Çowski D.K.D.1"},{"id":"56074066","text":"is a song recorded by Japanese singer Shizuka Kudo.

The song is noted for its use of a gospel choir. Kudo was praised for her presence on the record; she received acclaim for delivering vocals befitting of the genre with ease and critics noted that she was never drowned out by the \\"grand\\" backing orchestra of the Southern gospel- influenced track. In 2017, during a retrospective talk show on Yahoo!

It is a generalization of the usual a Gaussian mixture model (GMM). When the marginal distributions are restricted to be Gaussian, the model reduces to a GMM. To begin, the multivariate Gaussian copula is defined by the following probability function: F(uP)=\\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\Psi^{-1}(u_{1})}...\\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\Psi^{-1}(u_{d})}\\\\frac{1}{(2\\\\pi)^{n/2}P^{1/2}}exp(-\\\\frac{1}{2}v^TP^{-1}v)dv whose density is given by : f(uP)=\\\\frac{1}{(2\\\\pi)^{n/2}P^{1/2}}exp(-\\\\frac{1}{2}u^TP^{-1}u)\\\\prod_{d=1}^D\\\\frac{1}{\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2\\\\pi}}exp(-\\\\frac{1}{2}(\\\\Psi^{-1}(u_d))^2)} where : \\\\begin{array}{ll} \\\\Psi & \\\\text{is the one dimensional cumulative distribution function for a standard normal distribution with density} \\\\psi;\\\\\\\\\\\\ P & \\\\text{is the copula parameter matrix;}\\\\\\\\\\\\ d & \\\\text{is the number of dimension.}\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{array} Then, with the Gaussianlization of original data on each dimension, a GCMM for the joint distribution of a random vector X can be defined as follows: F(X\\\\pi)=\\\\sum_{k=1}^{K}\\\\pi_k\\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{Y_{k1}}...\\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{Y_{kd}}\\\\frac{1}{(2\\\\pi)^{n/2}P_k^{1/2}}exp(-\\\\frac{1}{2}Y^TP_kY)dY where : \\\\begin{array}{ll} x=[x_1\\\\ldots x_d] & \\\\text{is the marginal observation.}\\\\\\\\\\\\ Y_{k}=[Y_{1d} \\\\ldots Y_{kd}] & \\\\text{is the vector of the transferred data.}\\\\\\\\\\\\ Y_{kd}=\\\\Psi^{-1}(F_{kd}(x_{d})) & \\\\text{is the d-th dimension of the transferred data.}\\\\\\\\\\\\ Z_{kd}=f_{kd}(x_{d})=\\\\frac{\\\\partial F_{kd}}{\\\\partial x}(x_{d}) & \\\\text{is the density of the marginal distribution.}\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\pi_k & \\\\text{is the weight to the k-th copula.}\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{array} Its density is given by : f(X\\\\pi)=\\\\sum_{k=1}^{K} \\\\pi_k\\\\frac{1}{(2\\\\pi)^{n/2}P_k^{1/2}}exp(-\\\\frac{1}{2}Y_{k}^TP_kY_{k})\\\\prod_{d=1}^D\\\\frac{Z_{kd}}{\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2\\\\pi}}exp(-\\\\frac{1}{2}(Y_{kd})^2)} The density above is defined conditioned on the cumulative probability values and Gaussianized random variables which are both determined by the marginal distributions. The marginal distribution on each dimension for each component can be estimated via nonparametric methods such as kernel smoothing (Bowman 1998 [1]). ==Basic Properties of GCMM== A GCMM is defined based on the separation of the mixture of copulas and marginal distributions, which may potentially lead to different behavior from GMM. To understand the properties of GCMM, its likelihood function is studied so that appropriate estimation algorithms can be designed. The major properties of GCMM are discussed below: 1 A GCMM has a bounded likelihood function value on bounded domains and tractable derivatives conditioned on the estimated marginal probability functions. The likelihood function is given below: : L=\\\\sum_{n=1}^{N} ln (\\\\sum_{k=1}^{K} \\\\pi_k \\\\frac{1}{(2\\\\pi)^{n/2}P^{1/2}} exp(-\\\\frac{1}{2}(Y_{n,k})^TPY_{n,k})\\\\prod_{i=1}^D \\\\frac{Z_{n,ki}}{\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2\\\\pi}}exp(-\\\\frac{1}{2}(Y_{n,ki})^2) } ) We provide the following theorem to demonstrate the features of such a likelihood function and the proof is given in the appendix. Under suitable conditions, the likelihood function is bounded above in bounded region; non-decreasing and negative semi-definite w.r.t density} Z_{n,k_i} ; may contain both local minimum and local maximum w.r.t transformed variables} Y_{n,k}. 2 The value of its likelihood function is nondecreasing during iterations of Expectation- Maximum algorithms that are applied with GCMM and the algorithms converge globally to local maximums under mild conditions(Wu 1983 [11]). The design and properties of these Expectation-Maximum algorithms are discussed in the next section. 3 Model selection can be conducted through Akaike information criteria (Fan 2009 [5]) and cluster methods such as k-means or hierarchy clustering can be used to set the initial parameters of each component. ==Linkage with GMM== Gaussian mixture models have been used widely in various applications and the Expectation Maximum algorithm has been utilized for estimating their parameters. The convergence properties of such Expectation Maximum algorithms have been discussed in Lei (1996 [12]). However, each component of a GMM is a multivariate gaussian distribution that cannot effectively capture heavy tails and the number of components become sensitive w.r.t heavy tails. The introduction of more flexible components may help to further reduce number of components when working with heavy-tailed data. On the other hand, copulas have been used in research for model dependence. The definition of a copula in the two dimensional case is given as below: Let P be a conditional bivariate distribution function with continuous margins F_X and F_Y, and let \\\\mathcal{F} be some conditioning set. There then exists a unique conditional copula C:[0,1]\\\\times[0,1] such that (Sklar (1959) [9]): P(x,yF)=C(F_X(x\\\\mathcal{F}),F_Y(y\\\\mathcal{F})\\\\mathcal{F}), \\\\forall x, y \\\\in R The definitions above can easily be generalized to higher dimensions. The advantages of the copula method include the following: 1 Heavy-tailed joint distributions can be modeled; 2 Marginal distributions and their dependence structure can be studied separately; 3 Copulas can be calibrated to data sets that are sparse and unevenly distributed. Upper tail dependence can be studied using copulas (Nelson 2006 [7]) and copulas can be estimated using a two-step maximum likelihood method the properties of which are discussed in White (1994 [10]). In the two dimensional case, Archimedean copulas such as BB1 are more flexible than Gaussian in capturing heavy tails while the estimation of higher dimensional Archimedean copulas may not be as fully studied as in the two dimensional case (Marius 2012 [6]). Factor models have been introduced to control model complexity as well (DongHwan 2011 [4]). In transportation research, different copula family are reviewed and applied to model residential neighborhood choices (Bhat 2009 [14]). Within this context, a mixture of Gaussian copulas presents an effective alternative method for improving model performance if one wants to study complex dependence structures based on simple copulas. Finally, Gaussian Copula Mixture Models are developed to meet both needs. Gaussian Copula Mixture Models can be viewed as extension of Gaussian Mixture Models (\\\\cite{Pekka2006} and \\\\cite{Yang1998GMM}), which aim to address the following two concerns: 1 Heavy- tailed data require increasing numbers of clusters to fit GMMs. To capture the control number of clusters, heavy tails on marginal distributions may lead to greater number of clusters in GMM. However, if the heavy-tailed data appear independently on each dimension, we should not use increasing number of clusters to describe them; in another word, multidimensional cluster should be introduced in copula space instead of the original data space and heavy tailed marginal distributions should be modeled separately. These intuition leads to GCMM, in which marginal distributions can be updated using non-parametric methods, and mixture models are used to model the dependent structure. Such a model potentially leads to fewer number of clusters. 2 GMMs are usually applied to a synchronized panel data matrix of dimension M and number of observations N . In many problems, there are numerous unsynchronized data on each dimension, the number of which is denoted as n_m for the m -th dimension. Such data should be utilized to update the joint distribution shared by the different dimensions. For a concrete example, if we have 500 observations (of travel time) on Link A and 400 observations on Link B, with 300 by 2 observations which are synchronized data between A and B, GMM will utilize the 300 by 2 observations to update the mixture model and GCMM will also utilize 300 by 2 observations points to update the mixture copula structure. But GCMM will further utilize the unsynchronized 200 observations for A and 100 observations for B to update their marginal travel time distributions respectively, which further contributes to the estimation of the copula mixture during iteration. ==Expectation Maximum Algorithms for GCMM1 The Base Case Algorithm with Synchronized Data=== The algorithm updates the mixture of copulas and the marginal distributions separately. Essentially when estimating GMMs, the weights \\\\pi^m_{k} \\\\& correlation matrixes of components P^m_k and the sufficient statistics (mean \\\\mu^m_{ki} and standard deviation \\\\sigma^m_{ki}) of the marginal normal distributions are updated (Dempster 1977 [3]) based on the posterior probability \\\\gamma^m_{nk}. In GCMMs, the sufficient statistics of marginal normal distributions are replaced with non-parametric estimators to the marginal pdf f^m_{ki} and cdf F^m_{ki} to improve flexility, The major challenge of algorithm design lies in how the marginal distributions should be updated considering the posterior probability. An updating formula is developed and given by the following theorem: In the GCMM base case, the updating of the marginal distributions follows the following formula with necessary normalizations: F'_{ki}(c)=\\\\sum_n \\\\gamma_{nk} 1_{x_{ni} \\\\leq c} Based on the theorem, the algorithm is further developed below: 1 Expectation Step: D^m_{nk}=\\\\prod_{i=1}^D\\\\frac{Z^m_{n,ki}}{\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2\\\\pi}}\\\\exp(\\\\frac{1}{2}(Y^m_{n,ki})^2)} r^m_{nk}=\\\\frac{\\\\pi_k\\\\frac{D^m_{n,k}}{P^m_k^{1/2}}exp(-\\\\frac{1}{2}(Y^m_{nk})^TP_k^{m,-1}Y^m_{nk})}{\\\\sum_{j=1}^K \\\\pi_j\\\\frac{D^m_{n,j}}{P^m_j^{1/2}}exp(-\\\\frac{1}{2}(Y^m_{nj})^TP_j^{m,-1}Y^m_{nj})} 2 Maximum Step: \\\\pi_k^m=\\\\frac{\\\\sum_{n=1}^N r^m_{nk}}{N} P_k^m=\\\\frac{\\\\sum_{n=1}^{N}r^m_{nk}Y^m_{nk}(Y^m_{nk})^T}{\\\\sum_{n=1}^{N}r^m_{nk}} F_{ki}^m(y)=\\\\frac{\\\\sum_n r_{nk}^m 1_{x_{ni} \\\\leq y}}{\\\\sum_n r_{nk}^m} \\\\forall k -th copula, i-th dimension The issue here is that heavy tail phenomenons may be categorized into two classes: the heavy tails in the marginal distribution and the heavy tails in the dependence structure. GCMM separates the estimation for them and control the number of clusters purely based on the complexity of heavy tails in dependence structure (the latter). In this manner, the number of clusters could be further reduced and the mixture of copulas are robust towards heavy tails on the marginal distributions (the former). ===2 Algorithm with Unsynchronized Data=== GCMMs with unsynchronized data are developed based on the rationale that unsynchronized data in each dimension can be used to update the marginal distribution, given the estimation of marginal distribution is separated from the mixture of copulas. An additional posterior probability \\\\gamma^{'m}_{n_i,k}is introduced to represent the probability of n_i -th unsynchronized data on the i-th dimension belonging to the k-th component. An additional loop is then inserted into the Expectation Maximum algorithm for GCMM base case which further updates \\\\gamma^{'m}_{n_i,k} based on new information, The major challenge of algorithm design lies in how the marginal distributions should be further updated given unsynchronized data and the existing nonparametric estimator. An updating formula is developed and given by the following theorem: In the GCMM with unsynchronized data, the updating formula of marginal distribution follows by the following formula with necessary normalizations: r'_{n_i,k}=\\\\frac{\\\\pi_k f_{ki}(x_{n_i})}{\\\\sum_{k=1}^K \\\\pi_k f_{ki}(x_{n_i})} F'_{ki}(c)=\\\\sum_n \\\\gamma_{nk} 1_{x_{ni} \\\\leq c}+\\\\sum_{n_i} \\\\gamma'_{n_i,k} 1_{x_{n_i} \\\\leq c} Based on the theorem, the algorithm is further developed below 1 Generate an initial cluster of the link travel time distribution for X_i and classify the marginal data to each such clusters. 2 Expectation step: 2.1 update r^m_{nk} for synchronized data; 2.2 update r^{'m}_{n_i,k} for un-synchronized data using the following Bayes formula: r^{'m}_{n_i,k}=\\\\frac{\\\\pi_k f^{m-1}_{ki}(x_{n_i})}{\\\\sum_{k=1}^K \\\\pi_k f^{m-1}_{ki}(x_{n_i})} 3 Maximum step: 3.1 Convert the marginal observations into probability values using the marginal cumulative distribution functions. 3.2 Conduct maximum likelihood estimation for the Gaussian copula mixture model given r_{n,k}. 3.3 Update the marginal link travel time cumulative distribution functions F_n according to the posterior classification probability r^m_{n,k} and r^{'m}_{n_i,k}. F^m_{ki}(y)=\\\\frac{\\\\sum_n r^m_{nk} 1_{x_{ni}\\\\leq y}+\\\\sum_{n_i} r^{'m}_{n_i,k} 1_{x_{n_i}\\\\leq y}}{\\\\sum_n r^m_{nk}+\\\\sum_{n_i} r^{'m}_{n_i,k}} \\\\forall\\\\ kth\\\\ copula,ith\\\\ dimension (kernel smoothing can be applied) 4 Check convergence. If not, goto Step 2 . \\\\end{enumerate} In comparison with the Base case algorithm, the differences are highlighted below: 1 In Expectation step: 1.1 update r_{nk}^m for synchronized data; 1.2 update r^{'m}_{n_i,k} for un- synchronized data using the following Bayes formula: r^{'m}_{n_i,k}=\\\\frac{\\\\pi_k^m f_{ki}^m(x_{n_i})}{\\\\sum_{k=1}^K \\\\pi_k^m f_{ki}^m(x_{n_i})} In each iteration, update the marginal cdfs F_n according to r_{nk} and r'_{n'k}. \\\\forall k-th copula, i-th dimension: F^m_{ki}(y)=\\\\frac{\\\\sum_n r^m_{nk} 1_{x_{ni}\\\\leq y}+\\\\sum_{n_i} r^{'m}_{n_i,k} 1_{x_{n_i}\\\\leq y}}{\\\\sum_n r^m_{nk}+\\\\sum_{n_i} r^{'m}_{n_i,k}} Overall, the philosophical issue here is whether synchronized data truly represent the joint distribution adequately and whether the unsynchronized data may add to our understanding of it. To bring unsynchronized data into the whole Expectation Maximum algorithm enlarges the information set of the probability space (\\\\Omega,\\\\mathcal{F},P) so that deeper elaboration of the data is possible (Cinlar 2011 [2]). This is a significant improvement from GMM beyond the flexibility applied to the marginal distribution. ==References== Gaussian copula model slides http://dataspace.princeton.edu/jspui/handle/88435/dsp01vd66w212h Full disertation on GCMM, http://dataspace.princeton.edu/jspui/handle/88435/dsp01vd66w212h Xu, L. and M.

Falkenmark is best known for her long-standing work and expertise on the sustainable use of water resources to meet human and ecosystem needs. Her work is characterized by an integration of both natural- and social-science approaches. She is particularly known for developing what is now known as the Falkenmark Water Stress Indicator, an indicator used to measure and describe the water available for human use. She is the daughter of Halvar Sundberg. == Life and career == Falkenmark graduated as a Fil. Mag. (Swedish equivalent to a master's degree) in mathematics, physics, chemistry and mechanics at Uppsala University, in 1951. In 1964 she became the first Fil. Lic. (Swedish equivalent of PhD at the time) of hydrology in Sweden, where she studied the ‚ÄúBearing capacity of an ice sheet‚Äù. Later in 1975, she was awarded the title of PhD Honoris causa at Link√∂ping University. Falkenmark's professional history includes holding positions as State Hydrologist at the Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute (1950s-60's), and later at the Swedish Natural Science Research Council (1965‚Äì95), where she became Executive Secretary, and later Chair of the Swedish National Committees for UNESCO‚Äôs International Hydrological Decade/Programme. As the Chair of the Scientific Program Committee at the Stockholm International Water Institute (SIWI) (1991- 2003), Falkenmark led the establishment of the annual Stockholm World Water Week (initially named Stockholm Water Symposium), which grew to be the \\"annual focal point for the globe‚Äôs water issues\\" Falkenmark has held numerous posts on international boards and committees, including as General Rapporteur of the United Nations Water Conference Mar del Plata (1977); World Bank Consultant with special responsibility regarding the looming water scarcity (1988‚Äì92); member of the UN Committee on Energy and Natural Resources for Development and the UN Millennium Project Task Force for Environmental Sustainability; member of the Technical Advisory Committee of the Global Water partnership; and Scientific Advisor to the Global Environment Facility and the Comprehensive Freshwater Assessment of the World. Falkenmark is a Professor of Applied and International Hydrology. Between 1976 and 1979, she led the planning and development of the Department for Water and Environment Studies at Link√∂ping University; after her formal retirement, in 1991, she became part of Stockholm University‚Äôs Department of Systems Ecology. In 2007, she joined the Stockholm Resilience Center as a senior researcher. She is also currently the senior scientific advisor at the Stockholm International Water Institute (SIWI). In 2018, she shared the Blue Planet Prize with ecologist Brian Walker. == The Falkenmark Water Stress Indicator == In an article published in 1989, Falkenmark introduced an indicator for water stress that expresses the level of water scarcity in a certain region as the amount of renewable freshwater that is available for each person each year. It eventually became known as the Falkenmark Indicator, and is not only one of the earliest, but also one of the most used indicators to measure and describe water availability for human use. The level of water scarcity in a certain country was determined based on thresholds: If the amount of renewable water in a country is below 1,700 m3 per person per year, that country is said to be experiencing water stress; below 1,000 m3 it is said to be experiencing water scarcity; and below 500 m3, absolute water scarcity. == The Blue and Green Water Paradigm == The concepts of green and blue water were first introduced by Falkenmark in 1995, and defined green water as \\"the rainwater that infiltrates into the root zone and is used for biomass production\\", and blue water as \\"the water that either runs off from the soil surface or percolates beyond the root zone do form groundwater\\" In a more recent publication, green water has been defined as the soil water held in the unsaturated zone, formed by precipitation and available to plants, while blue water refers to liquid water in rivers, lakes, wetlands and aquifers, which can be withdrawn for irrigation and other human uses. Both resources are important for food production; rainfed agriculture uses green water only, while irrigated agriculture uses both green and blue water. == Selected awards and recognition == * KTH Stora Pris (1995) * Volvo Environment Prize (1998) * International Hydrology Prize (1998) * Rachel Carson Prize (2005) * Crystal Drop Award (2005) * Prince Albert II of Monaco Water and Desertification Award (2010) * Blue Planet Prize (2018) == References == Category:1925 births Category:Living people Category:Swedish hydrologists Category:Uppsala University alumni Category:Hydrologists Category:Swedish women scientists ","title":"Malin Falkenmark"},{"id":"56074301","text":"Leitir N.S.

The online store operates under the Ontario Cannabis Store (OCS) branding. The initial plan for legalization was for all retail outlets in Ontario to be operated by OCS, with at least 150 OCS stores opened by 2020. Following the election of the Progressive Conservative Party to government in the 2018 Ontario general election, the provincial government announced significant changes to the cannabis regulation and distribution system in August 2018.

In early November, Canada Post advised the OCS that the names and addresses of 4,500 customers had been accessed by an individual without authority to do so. The minimum legal age to purchase or use cannabis in Ontario is 19, and adults can carry up to 30 grams in public. Cannabis edibles will not be sold for another year, but home made food and drinks can be made.

Bill Diamond, (born June 5, 1957) is an American puppeteer, puppet fabricator, and producer. He worked for Jim Henson at his New York office, and has won three Emmy Awards for his work on the YES Network. == Background == Diamond began his career in the entertainment industry as a child actor on Broadway and on television commercials. As a teenager in High School, he created his own stop- motion animation films, ran his own theatre company, and began building puppets. At the age of nineteen, Diamond was introduced to Muppet‚Äôs creator, Jim Henson, who gave him a job working on Sesame Street. == Career == In 1976, Diamond created his production company, Bill Diamond Productions. Diamond produced and directed multiple television series in the 80‚Äôs and 90‚Äôs including, Stuffy‚Äôs Place, The Land of the Moonshins, and Dr. Rock‚Äôs Dinosaur Adventures, which appeared on Fox. He was also the associate producer of the documentaries, The Phantom of the Opera: Unmasking the Masterpiece, and The Aurora Monsters: The Model Craze That Gripped the World. The off-Broadway version of Audrey 2, the carnivorous plant from Little Shop of Horrors, was originally created by Sesame Street puppeteer Martin P. Robinson. The play became extremely popular, and in 1984, Diamond was hired to build and puppeteer an Audrey 2, and still operates the giant plant puppet for the Little Shop of Horrors road tours to this day. In 2001, a massive blaze completely engulfed Diamond's studio in Peekskill, New York. Over 200 of Diamond's puppets and original creations were destroyed. Diamond rebuilt the studio in an industrial complex in Cornwall, New York, but in January 2012, a six alarm fire destroyed the majority of that industrial complex. Diamond's studio and creations survived the second fire, leaving only water damage in the complex. The smoke from the fire was seen from the George Washington Bridge more than 40 miles away. In 2016, The Jim Henson Company sponsored a fan film competition held on The Dark Crystal website. The competition invited fans to create and submit animated short films inspired by the Jim Henson film. Bill Diamond Productions submitted a short film for the competition titled, ‚ÄúRise of the Skeksis‚Äù, and received an honorable mention. == Awards == In 2015, Diamond won his first Emmy Award for his work on the YES Network's Yankees Post Game Show - Mo‚Äôs Last Home Game as the lighting director. In 2017, he won his second Emmy for set design on the YES Network for Brooklyn Nets Specialty Set Design, and was nominated for another for lighting director for YES's Brooklyn Nets Specialty Look. In 2019, Diamond's company, Bill Diamond Productions, was one of the Telly Award's Silver Winners for the Entertainment General-Online category. The company received the award for their production, Gorgo's Christmas Carol Narrated by Vincent Price. In 2020, Diamond won his third Emmy Award. This time for set design for the YES Network's Yankees Buzz in the Bronx. == References Bill Diamond's Official Website Category:1957 births Category:American puppeteers Category:Living people ","title":"Bill Diamond"},{"id":"56074381","text":"Youth Of China () is a 1937 patriotic film directed by Wong Tat-Tsoi.È¶ôÊ∏ØÂΩ±ÁâáÂ§ßÂÖ® - Page 190 9628050036 Hong Kong.

Several pronouns also have special forms used after prepositions. Spanish is a pro-drop language with respect to subject pronouns, and, like French and other languages with T-V distinction, modern Spanish makes a distinction in second person pronouns that has no equivalent in modern English. Object pronouns are generally proclitic, but enclitic object pronouns are mandatory in certain situations. In addition, the second-person singular pronoun vos is found in numerous regions of Latin America, spanning Central America, Uruguay, Paraguay, Argentina, Chile, Per√∫, Ecuador and Colombia and the Andean regions of Bolivia and the Venezuelan state of Zulia. ==Table of personal pronouns== Peninsular, Latin American, and Ladino Spanish personal pronouns are all listed in the table below. Sephardic Jews speak Ladino or Judaeo, which uses some personal pronouns that have fallen out of use in Spanish. {  style=\\"text-align: center;\\" - !

Information contained in verb endings often renders the explicit use of subject pronouns unnecessary and even erroneous, although they may still be used for clarity or emphasis: * Yo hago or just Hago = \\"I do\\" * Ellos vieron or just Vieron = \\"They saw\\" English subject pronouns are generally not translated into Spanish when neither clarity nor emphasis is an issue. \\"I think\\" is generally translated as just Creo unless the speaker is contrasting his or her views with those of someone else or placing emphasis on the fact that their views are their own and not somebody else's. The masculine and feminine third-person pronouns (√©l, ella, ellos, and ellas) can refer to grammatically masculine and feminine objects, respectively, as well as people, although their explicit use as impersonal subjects is somewhat uncommon. The neuter third-person singular pronoun ello (as well as its plural ellos) is likewise rarely used as an explicit subject in everyday Spanish, although such usage is found in formal and literary language. Quite unusually among European languages, the first- and second-person plural subject pronouns (nosotros/nosotras and vosotros/vosotras, respectively) also inflect for gender: nosotros and vosotros are used to refer to groups of men (as well as men and women), and nosotras and vosotras are used exclusively to refer to groups of women. ===T√∫/vos and usted=== Like French and other languages with the T-V distinction, modern Spanish has a distinction in its second-person pronouns that has no equivalent in modern English. The most basic is the difference between t√∫ (vos in voseo areas) and usted: t√∫ or vos is the \\"familiar\\" form, and usted, derived from the third-person form \\"your grace\\" (vuestra merced), is the \\"polite\\" form. The appropriate usage of these forms is fundamental to interpersonal communication. Using the usted form when addressing someone implies that the person addressed is a social superior, someone to whom respect is owed, or someone with whom one does not have a close relationship; traditionally a child will use usted when addressing a parent. In contrast, the use of t√∫ or vos implies that the person addressed is an equal, a comrade, a friend, someone with whom one has a close relationship, or a child or other social inferior, including (traditionally) a maid or other household employee. T√∫ is also used to address God, in parallel with English's otherwise abandoned use of Thou. The usage changed in the 20th century: A woman who addressed her mother as using usted could experience that her children call her using t√∫. Also, in Spain the Falangists and the Communists promoted the tuteo as a sign of worker solidarity. One can give offense by addressing someone with t√∫ instead of usted, similar to inappropriately calling someone by his/her first name in English; conversely, it can also be awkward to use usted where t√∫ would be expected, suggesting too much social distance or implying that the person addressed is being haughty. Spanish has a verb, tutear, meaning to use the familiar form t√∫ to address a person. Commonly, if a speaker feels that the relationship with the conversant has evolved‚Äîsometimes only after a few minutes of conversation‚Äîto a point where a shift from usted to t√∫ is desirable, he or she will confirm this by asking if it is acceptable: Nos tuteamos, ¬øverdad? or ¬øTe puedo tutear? is fairly common. In Anglophone countries, this would be roughly analogous to asking if it is acceptable to call someone by their first name. In the plural, in Spain (other than the Canary Islands and parts of western Andalusia), the usage of the familiar vosotros/vosotras and the polite ustedes is identical to the usage of t√∫/usted. In the Canary Islands as well as those parts of western Andalusia, in addition to all of Spanish America, vosotros is not used except in very formal contexts such as oratory, and ustedes is the familiar as well as the polite plural. The distinction extends to other types of pronouns and modifiers: when using usted one must also use the third-person object pronouns and possessive adjectives. \\"Tu casa\\" (t√∫ with an (acute) accent is the subject pronoun, tu with no accent is a possessive adjective) means \\"your house\\" in the familiar singular: the owner of the house is one person, and it is a person with whom one has the closer relationship the t√∫ form implies. In contrast, su casa can mean \\"his/her/their house\\", but it can also mean \\"your house\\" in the polite singular: the owner of the house is someone with whom one has the more distant or formal relationship implied by the use of usted. Similarly, the use of usted requires third-person object pronouns, except in some Andalusian dialects. Te lavas means \\"you [familiar singular] wash yourself\\", but se lava can mean \\"you [polite singular] wash yourself\\", as well as \\"he/she/it washes himself/herself/itself\\"'. ===Impersonal pronouns=== There are several impersonal pronouns in Spanish: * uno (\\"one\\", as well as una for women), which declines as a normal third-person pronoun and is treated as such for purposes of conjugation and reflexivity. * Many ideas that would be expressed with an impersonal pronoun in English would more often be expressed with so-called pasiva refleja (passive reflexive) constructions in Spanish, e.g. \\"That is not done\\" (Eso no se hace) rather than \\"You (One) wouldn't do that\\" (Uno no hace eso). * The impersonal t√∫ might be a recent phenomenon. It is conjugated with the second-person but is not directed to the listener. According to one scholar, it might have appeared in the Valencian Community around the 1940s. Soler-Espiauba, page 201. It is used very often in speech in Spain, e.g. . ==Reflexive pronouns and intensifiers== The third person is the only person with a distinct reflexive pronoun: se. In the first and second persons, the normal object pronouns are used. Thus, the reflexive forms are: {  - ! Singular !! !! Plural !! -  yo  me  nosotros/nosotras  nos -  t√∫/vos  te  vosotros/vosotras  os -  √©l/ella/ello/usted  se  ellos/ellas/ustedes  se } The reflexive pronoun is used with pronominal verbs, also known as reflexive verbs. These verbs require the use of the reflexive pronoun, appropriate to the subject. Some transitive verbs can take on a reflexive meaning, such as lavar (to wash) and lavarse (to wash oneself). Other verbs have reflexive forms which do not take on a reflexive meaning, such as ir (to go) and irse (to go away). Some verbs only have reflexive forms, such as jactarse (to boast). The nominal intensifier in Spanish (equivalent to English \\"myself\\", \\"yourself\\", \\"themselves\\", etc. when used after a noun) is mismo, which in this case is placed after the noun it modifies and behaves like a normal adjective. Thus: * Yo mismo lo hice = \\"I [masc.] myself did it\\" * No entiendo porque necesitas la cosa misma = \\"I don't understand why you need the thing itself\\" * D√°selo a los hombres mismos = \\"Give it to the men themselves\\" * A nosotros no nos gustan las chicas mismas = \\"We don't like the girls themselves\\" (lit. \\"The girls themselves don't please us\\") Unlike English intensifiers, which are often placed several words after the noun they modify (e.g. \\"I did it myself\\"), Spanish intensifiers must come immediately after the noun they modify. ==Object pronouns== Object pronouns are personal pronouns that take the function of an object in a sentence. In Spanish, they may be analyzed as clitics which cannot function independently, but take the conjugated form of the Spanish verb. Object pronouns are generally proclitic, i.e. they appear before the verb of which they are the object. Enclitic pronouns (i.e. pronouns attached to the end of the verb or similar word itself) most often appear with positive imperatives and may appear with infinitives and gerunds as well. In all compound infinitives that make use of the past participle, enclitics attach to the uninflected auxiliary verb and not the past participle(s) itself. In Spanish, two (and rarely three) clitic pronouns can be used with a single verb, generally one accusative and one dative. They follow a specific order based primarily on person: {  style=\\"width:13em\\" - ! align=\\"center\\"  1  2  3  4 -  se  te os  me nos  lo, la, los, las, le, les } Thus: * √âl me lo dio = \\"He gave it to me\\" * Ellos te lo dijeron = \\"They said it to you\\" * Yo te me dar√© = \\"I will give myself to you\\" * Vosotros os nos mostr√°is = \\"You [pl.] are showing yourselves to us\\" * Se le perdieron los libros = \\"The books disappeared on him\\" (lit. \\"The books got lost to him\\") The full and pronominal form of a reduplicated direct object must agree in gender and number: * A las tropas las dirige C√©sar. = \\"Caesar directs the troops.\\" When an accusative third-person non-reflexive pronoun (lo, la, los, or las) is used with a dative pronoun that is understood to also be third- person non-reflexive (le or les), the dative pronoun is replaced by se. Simple non-emphatic clitic doubling is most often found with dative clitics, although it is occasionally found with accusative clitics as well. In a wide area in central Spain, including Madrid, there exists the practice of le√≠smo; which is, using the indirect object pronoun le for the object pronoun where Standard Spanish would use lo (masculine) or la (feminine) for the object pronoun. ==Genitive pronouns== Genitive pronouns describe to whom something belongs or of whom (or sometimes what) something is a characteristic or property. They are analogous to English \\"mine\\", \\"yours\\", \\"his\\", \\"hers\\", etc., and unlike their English counterparts, they inflect for gender and number according to the thing possessed (not the possessor itself) and are generally used with the definite article: * Mi coche es m√°s grande que el tuyo = \\"My car is bigger than yours\\" * Tu casa tiene m√°s cuartos que la suya = \\"Your house has more rooms than his/hers/yours/theirs\\" * Estos libros son m√°s interesantes que los vuestros = \\"These books are more interesting than yours [pl.]\\" * Esas camisas son m√°s peque√±as que las nuestras = \\"Those shirts are smaller than ours\\" After ser, however, the definite article is usually omitted: * Este coche es m√≠o = \\"This car is mine\\" * Esta camisa es suya = \\"This shirt is his/hers/yours/theirs\\" To avoid ambiguity in the meaning of suyo, it may be replaced by de + the appropriate pronoun: * Estos pantalones son m√°s largos que los de √©l = \\"These pants are longer than his\\" * Esta camisa es de ella = \\"This shirt is hers\\" The neuter article lo can also be used with genitive pronouns to express the concept of \\"what is mine\\", \\"what is yours\\", \\"what is his\\", etc.: lo m√≠o, lo tuyo, lo suyo, etc. Genitive pronouns are identical in form to long-form possessive adjectives, which can be placed after the noun to place emphasis on the fact of possession. == Old forms  Formal vos === In the past, the pronoun vos was used as a respectful form of address, semantically equivalent to modern usted. This pronoun used the same conjugations as modern vosotros (see below) and also the oblique form os and the possessive vuestro/-a/-os/-as. However, unlike vosotros, which always refers to more than one person, vos was usually singular in meaning. The modern voseo of several countries (see below) derives from this old form, but has become a generic form of address instead of a specifically respectful form. Vos and its related forms are still used in literature, cinema, etc. when trying to depict the language of past centuries. == Regional variation  Voseo === The pronoun \\"vos\\" is used in some areas of Latin America, particularly in Central America, Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay, Chile, the state of Zulia in Venezuela, and the Andean regions of Colombia, Bolivia, Per√∫, and Ecuador. These are all distant from the large Spanish colonial cities, like Mexico City, Cartagena (Colombia), and Lima. In some areas, like the River Plate region, vos has become the only generic form of address for the second-person singular, that is, it has the same meaning that t√∫ has elsewhere (informal and intimate). In other areas, like Chile, it persists as a fairly stigmatized form alongside the more prestigious t√∫. In some other areas, it is employed among equals but not for very close people (couples or family) or to inferiors (children, animals etc.), where the pronoun t√∫ would normally be used. Ladino speakers use vos as well, except that they employ it as in Old Spanish (see above), that is, as a respectful form of address, equivalent to how usted is used elsewhere. In fact, Ladino speakers do not use usted at all because vos implies the same respect that it once had in Old Spanish. In Ladino, t√∫ is used towards anyone in an informal manner. === The use of vusted and vuestra merced === The variant vusted/vustedes is mostly a regionalism in some South American countries. It is common to hear it in isolated areas of Colombia and Venezuela. Other speakers consider it archaic because it is an older form of a contraction of vuestra merced. In Colombia, it is not unusual to hear people use su merced interchangeably with usted. Su merced can be used in the vocative case as well, e.g. when speaking to an older person, as in Su merced, ¬øpor qu√© no vienen vusted y sus nietos a mi casa esta tarde? Vuestra merced (literally \\"your grace\\") is the origin of usted, usarc√© and similar forms that govern third-person verb forms with a second-person function. They are mostly confined to period works now. It is unlikely that similar-sounding Arabic ustƒÅdh ÿ£Ÿèÿ≥Ÿíÿ™Ÿéÿßÿ∞Ÿí (\\"professor\\") was involved in the formation of Spanish usted, given the weakness of the semantic link and the fact that usted is not documented before 1598 ‚Äî over a century after the fall of Moorish Granada. === The use of vosotros === Today, the informal second-person plural pronoun vosotros is widely used by Spaniards, except in some southwestern regions and in most of the Canary Islands, where its use is rare. Among the former colonies of the Spanish Empire, the use of vosotros and its normal conjugations is also retained in the Philippines and Equatorial Guinea.In Jos√© Rizal's Noli me tangere, Salom√© uses vosotros to refer to El√≠as and his passengers that day. In its sequel, El filibusterismo, in the chapter entitled Risas, llantos, Sandoval addresses his fellow students using vosotros. Vosotros is the only form used by Sephardic Jews who speak Ladino. Throughout Latin America, the second person plural pronoun ustedes is universally used orally in both formal (singular usted) and informal (singular t√∫/vos) contexts. However, \\"that vosotros is not used in Spanish America is one of the great myths of Spanish language instruction, at least in the U.S.\\"Daniel Eisenberg, \\"What I Have Learned about Spanish from 22 Years of Teaching It\\", Journal of Hispanic Philology, 16, 1991, pp. 3-9, https://web.archive.org/web/20160313023530/http://users.ipfw.edu/jehle/deisenbe/JHPcolumn/WHATIVE.htm, retrieved May 4, 2017. The following quote from Sandino was displayed on a billboard in Nicaragua: Vosotros is not unusual in oratory, legal documents, or other highly formal or archaic contexts. === Creoles === Forms based on vosotros and vos are used in many Spanish-based creole languages. In Chavacano, spoken in the Philippines, vo is used alongside tu as a singular second-person pronoun in Zamboangue√±o, Cavite√±o, and Ternate√±o. In Zamboangue√±o, evos is also used.

M√©li√®s found opportunity to parody such wrestling bouts multiple times, with Nouvelles Luttes extravagantes a notable example.

The smaller of the two female wrestlers is played by Jehanne d'Alcy. == Release and reception == Nouvelles Luttes extravagantes was sold by M√©li√®s's Star Film Company and is numbered 309‚Äì310 in its catalogues. It was sold as in the United States as Fat and Lean Wrestling Match and in the United Kingdom as The Wrestling Sextette. Film critic William B.

The album was released 25 March 1996 in Continental Europe, 20 May in the U.K. and 18 June in the U.S. It was produced by the American producer Richard Feldman. The recording of the album was already finished in early 1995, but the release was postponed by the record company. The recording took place in various studios in Dublin, Los Angeles, San Francisco, and in Ure's own studio in Bath. Ure first recorded some of the tracks with producer Julian Mendelsohn, but they were later re-recorded. In 1998 the single \\"Breathe\\" became a hit- single in several European countries, boosted by its use in a Swatch TV advert campaign, two years after its original release. The single charted at No.1 both at the Italian and the Austrian charts, No.10 in Spain and No.12 in Germany. \\"Guns And Arrows\\" and \\"Fields Of Fire\\" were also released as singles. The album offer a rich mixture of musical influences inspired by Ure's own Scottish background. With The Chieftains Paddy Moloney on Uilleann pipes and Hothouse Flowers Liam √ì Maonla√≠ on Bodhr√°n, Didgeridoo and Gaelic vocals, tracks like \\"Fallen Angel\\", \\"Sinnerman\\" and \\"Live Forever\\" pulse with the organic vibrancy that Ure had long wanted to capture. Ure called \\"Breathe\\": \\"More of a Midge Ure album than any other album I¬¥ve done.\\" \\"In a way\\", he adds, \\"Breathe is a much more honest and open record\\". Ure traces the origins of \\"Breathe\\" to a U.S. Tour he did with other songwriters in 1992. Once the other songwriters convinced him to try playing \\"Vienna\\" on acoustic guitar, Ure realized he could make music without the wealth of electronics or other musicians backing him up. \\"That turned my whole perception of what I was doing musically\\", he says. ==Track listing== 1,5,10 & 11: written by Ure / 2 & 6: Ure, Feldman / 3: Ure, Feldman, Bazilian / 4: Ure, Feldman, Klein / 7 & 9: Ure, Mitchell / 8: Ure, Feldman, Shipley ==Personnel== *Midge Ure - Vocals, acoustic guitar *Soundcape Guitar (on tracks 5 and 11) ‚Äì Robert Fripp *Double Violin, Vocals (on track 8) ‚Äì L.Shankar *Mandolin, Melodica ‚Äì Eric Bazilian *Vocals (on track 5) ‚Äì Sally Dworsky *Uilleann Bagpipes ‚Äì Paddy Moloney *Backing Vocals ‚Äì Jackie Sheridan, Kate Stephenson, Monalisa Young, Matthew Hager, Maxaynne Lewis *Gaelic Vocals, Backing Vocals ‚Äì Eleanor McEvoy *Fiddle ‚Äì Frank Gallagher *Hurdy Gurdy, Harmonium ‚Äì Ethan James *Accordion ‚Äì Frank McNamara, Pat Crowley *Bodhr√°n, Didgeridoo, Vocals [Celtic] ‚Äì Liam O'Maonlai *Guitar ‚Äì Dean Parks *Bass Guitar ‚Äì Larry Klein, Jeremy Meehan *Drums ‚Äì David Palmer, Andy Kravitz, *Cello ‚Äì Ofra Harnoy *Celtic Harp ‚Äì Noreen O'Donoghue *Percussion - Mike Fisher, Iki Levy *Programming, Keyboards, Percussion ‚Äì Richard Feldman *Keyboards - Charles Judge, Jamie Muhulrick == References == *Liner Notes == External links == *AllMusic Category:1996 albums Category:Midge Ure albums ","title":"Breathe (Midge Ure album)"},{"id":"56074685","text":"Tao Jin (Èô∂Èáë 22 January 1916 - 28 September 1986) was a popular Chinese actor of the 1940s and 1950s.China's Screen 1981 \\"He then first joined the Tianyi Film Company, where he appeared in three films, and later the progressive Shanghai Amateurs Association.

It was planned by architect Giovanni Battista Bossi (1864‚Äì1924) in 1904‚Äì1906 on behalf of Cav. Giacomo Guazzoni, who was living before in via Leonardo da Vinci 49/a,Guida Savallo, 1902 master builder as a profession. Guazzoni was also the executer of the work. The house was built in a part of the area previously occupied by Societ√† Anonima degli Omnibus (S.A.O), founded in 1861 to manage public transportation in Milan with horse trams and which also had the concession of Tranvia Milano-Monza, inaugurated on 8 July 1876 by the future king Umberto I of Italy. In 1900 the Municipality decided to publish a bid for a service of electric trams, won by Edison, S.A.O. was the second with the Westinghouse technology. The garage of via Sirtori which hosted 280 horses was closed, the land was sold to private people and the buildings demolished apart from 3 stables for 54 horses each, still visible in via Sirtori 32 (Twinset) e 24 (Nervesa shop). Via Malpighi was opened and new houses were built along the street. The building has been put under the protection of Beaux Arts on 3 May 1965 while all the area is under environmental protection from 6 February 2003. The facade has been cleaned and restored in 1982 under the direction of arch. Hybsch by Alvini Restauri. The decoration of the entrance and the staircase were restored by R.A. of arch. Piero Arosio in 1997. ==Structure of the building == The building is made of a double body with the shape of an \\"L‚Äù on a trapezoidal lot and is located at the corner of via Malpighi with via Melzo. The structure is made of supporting walls in bricks. The slab between the basement and the ground floor is made of reinforced concrete. == The decorations== The motivation of the historical restriction is the following: ‚ÄúImportant example of Milan Art Nouveau. It is characterized by a free treatment of the cement material and the application of exquisite wrought-iron united with a vivacious figurative sense. The building with protruding eaves has on the corner two superimposed and linked together balconies. The decoration is important in the first floor and emerges with putti that sustain the balconies and railings adorned in various ways. Other balconies are linked to the first ones with coupled iron columns and also have iron railings designed with an expressive style coherence.‚Äù \\"Differently from Casa Galimberti, here the cromatic effect, which should be chiaroscuro, is obtained using different materials: cement and iron are both structure and decoration. Also in this case the balconies and the windows become lighter going upwards, just as the decorations become simpler towards the top floor: the dense twine of putti and wreaths, sculpted in cement around the windows and the railings of the first floor becomes simpler in the vibrant and sharp weave of the above iron work. The architectural and decorative composition is very well chosen and extremely proportionate in its elements.\\"Architettura Liberty a Milano, Salvad√®-Frizzi Brianza, Mazzotta, 1984 The paintings in the belt between the second and the third floor have been lost. The driveway has a fine wrought-iron gate and frescoes with putti and flowers that were discovered in the restoration of 1997, probably by painter Paolo Sala. Wrought-iron is probably by Alessandro Mazzucotelli. In the entrance in front of the reception a painting of a lake with water plants has been discovered in 1997. The body of the staircase is hexagonal, with a railing in wrought-iron and cantilever steps made of marble. In 1997 the marbled base and the flower decoration on the ceiling and the sides have been restored.

A sub-brand of the Three company, the operator aims to attract customers primarily looking for cheaper deals than those available with Three directly, by offering a monthly rolling SIM-only service, limited to online-only support. Uniquely, the operator offers to buy back unused data by means of a bill discount, a practice which isn't widespread in the UK, but is exhibited elsewhere such as by US carrier Ting. == Tariffs == SIM card package from SMARTY All plans are monthly, rather than long-term contracts, and are paid in advance by credit card, debit card, or cash via PayPoint, rather than via the more prevalent Direct Debit method. The company states that no credit checks are made. All plans include unlimited UK calls and texts. In common with other networks, SMARTY offers a fixed amount of mobile data (or an unlimited amount) for a fixed monthly payment. It also offers \\"data discount\\" plans, where the customer pays a ¬£5/month service charge and buys a small number of gigabytes of data. Under these plans, customers who do not use all their data allowance receive a credit on their next month's bill for unused data, calculated per megabyte at the same price as they paid for it. This credit for unused data is unique among UK mobile operators, as is the unified price of data add-ons; 1GB of data is priced the same, regardless of whether it is bought in advance as part of a customer's monthly rolling plan, or bought as an add-on which is consumed only when a customer's monthly allowance is used up. In this respect, SMARTY's offerings are functionally equivalent to standard pay-as-you-go (PAYG) tariffs offered by other providers, such as Three's own PAYG offering. Upon launch, SMARTY offered hotspot and tethering functionality, although they did not offer the ability to call foreign numbers, roam abroad, or dial premium numbers. As of June 2018, these features are now available. In early 2018, SMARTY launched a refer-a-friend program. If a customer refers a friend, both get a free month on SMARTY. There are no limits to this, so if a customer refers one friend a month they will keep their mobile bill free. == References  External links == * Category:Mobile virtual network operators Category:Telecommunications in England Category:2017 establishments in England Category:Telecommunications companies established in 2017 Category:Companies based in Maidenhead ","title":"SMARTY"},{"id":"56074794","text":"The Living Playing Cards () is a 1905 French short silent film directed by Georges M√©li√®s. == Synopsis == A magician enters a stage set on which a large white screen has been placed.

Originating from a tropical wave, it developed into a tropical depression on September 16 while situated to the east of the Lesser Antilles. Gradual intensification occurred over the next day or two and it strengthened into a tropical storm, which was named Maria. By late on September 17, Maria had intensified into a hurricane. As it approached the island arc, it underwent explosive intensification on September 18, with the hurricane reaching Category 5 intensity as it made landfall on the island of Dominica early on September 19. Land interaction weakened the storm somewhat, although it was able to quickly recover and later peaked that night with sustained winds of 175 mph (280 km/h) and a pressure of . Early the next morning it weakened to a high-end Category 4 hurricane before making landfall in Puerto Rico. Maria weakened significantly due to crossing the island, but was able to strengthen somewhat as it passed close to Hispaniola and The Bahamas on September 21‚Äì23. Structural changes in the hurricane as it moved further north and close to the Outer Banks in the United States ultimately caused Maria to weaken quickly. Turning away from the United States as a weakened tropical storm, it became extratropical on September 30, dissipating 3 days later. The hurricane caused catastrophic damage across its path in the Caribbean, with 3,057 killed and around $91.6 billion (2017 USD) in damages, making it the third-costliest Atlantic hurricane on record. The islands of Dominica and Puerto Rico experienced the worst impacts of Maria, which was the most intense storm to strike the former, and the worst storm to strike the latter since the 1928 San Felipe Segundo hurricane. ==Origins== Tropical Storm Maria east of the Lesser Antilles on September 16, with Lee to its east The National Hurricane Center (NHC) began monitoring two tropical waves on September 13. The eastern wave quickly spun up into what would become Hurricane Lee, while the western one continued moving generally westward. With mostly favorable conditions in the disturbance's path, development into a tropical cyclone seemed likely. During those two days the disturbance became better organized, and by September 16, convective banding became established around a poorly-organized circulation. As the system was an imminent threat to land despite the center not being well-defined, the NHC upgraded it to a tropical depression at 12:00 UTC, while situated east of Barbados. A mid-level ridge anchored north of the disturbance steered it generally west-northwest into a region highly favorable for further development. Sea surface temperatures of , low wind shear, and ample moisture were anticipated to foster strengthening to hurricane-status before the system reached the Lesser Antilles. As the disturbance continued to grow increasingly well-defined throughout the day, it was upgraded to a tropical storm at 18:00 UTC that day based on satellite estimates, and was given the name Maria. A central dense overcast and favorable outflow developed atop the center of circulation, which enabled Maria to become further organized throughout the early morning hours of September 17. After a brief intrusion of dry air exposed the circulation, a convective burst occurred over the center and intensification resumed. Hurricane Hunters investigating the system observed surface winds of and a formative eye feature. Accordingly, the NHC upgraded Maria to hurricane status at 18:00 UTC. ==Rapid intensification and Caribbean landfalls== Hurricane Maria at peak intensity to the south of St. Croix, early on September 20 Expansion of the central dense overcast and an increasingly complete eyewall signaled steady intensification throughout the night of September 17‚Äì18. Considerable lightning activity was identified within the hurricane's core early on September 18 and statistical models indicated a high probability of rapid intensification. Explosive strengthening took place shortly thereafter, with aircraft reconnaissance finding surface winds of and a central pressure of 959 mbar (hPa; 28.32 inHg), making Maria a Category 3 hurricane on the Saffir‚ÄìSimpson scale, and hence a major hurricane. Additionally, radar data revealed a well-defined wide eye. The eye contracted slightly to as intensification continued. Final radar image of Maria from the San Juan radar at 09:50 UTC (5:50 a.m local time) on September 20, before it was destroyed Rapid intensification culminated late on September 18, with Maria achieving Category 5 status just 15 mi (25 km) east-southeast of Dominica. Hurricane Hunters observed surface winds of and a pressure of 925 mbar (hPa; 27.32 inHg) at this time, and soon afterward, Maria reached its initial peak intensity with winds of 165 mph (270 km/h) and a central pressure of 922 mbar (hPa; 27.23 inHg). Maria made landfall in Dominica at 01:15 UTC on September 19, becoming the first Category 5 hurricane on record to strike the island nation. Interaction with the high mountains of Dominica imparted slight weakening of the hurricane to Category 4; however, once it had emerged into the Caribbean Sea, Maria quickly regained Category 5 intensity. Additional strengthening took place as the storm tracked northwest toward Puerto Rico. Despite the formation of concentric eyewalls‚Äîthe larger one spanning and the smaller only , signalling the start of an eyewall replacement cycle‚Äîthe inner violent core remained undisrupted through the afternoon. Maria attained its peak intensity at 03:00 UTC on September 20, roughly 30 mi (45 km) south of St. Croix. Maximum sustained winds reached 175 mph (280 km/h), and the storm's central pressure bottomed out at 908 mbar (hPa; 26.81 inHg); this ranks it as the tenth-most intense Atlantic hurricane since reliable records began. The hurricane made its closest approach to St. Croix at around 05:00 UTC on September 20, passing within 20 mi (30 km) of the island; the storm's outer eyewall lashed the island while the more violent inner eye remained offshore. Three hours later, at around 08:00 UTC, the outer eyewall struck Vieques, an island off the eastern coast of Puerto Rico. By this time, the outer eyewall became dominant as the inner one decayed, and the eyewall replacement cycle caused Maria weaken to Category 4 strength. Maria made landfall near Yabucoa, Puerto Rico, at 10:15 UTC, with winds of 155 mph (250 km/h) and a central pressure of 920 mbar (hPa; 27.17 inHg), making it the strongest to hit the island since the 1928 San Felipe Segundo hurricane, which had struck Puerto Rico as a Category 5 hurricane. Additionally, when Maria made landfall in Puerto Rico as a Category 4 storm, following the landfalls of Harvey and Irma, it marked the first time that three Category 4 hurricanes made landfall in the United States within a year, including unincorporated territories. ==Post- landfall reintensification== Infrared satellite loop of Maria passing east of Turks and Caicos Islands on September 22 Maria maintained a general west- northwest course across Puerto Rico, emerging over the Atlantic Ocean shortly before 18:00 UTC. Interaction with the mountainous terrain resulted in substantial weakening; sustained winds fell to 110 mph (175 km/h) and the central pressure rose to 959 mbars (hPa; 28.32 inHg). With favorable environmental conditions, Maria steadily reorganized as it moved away from Puerto Rico. A large eye, 45 mi (75 km) wide, developed with deep convection blossoming around it. Early on September 21, the system regained Category 3 intensity. Initially, cooler waters stirred up by Hurricane Irma two weeks prior limited Maria's reorganization. During the afternoon of September 21, the system traversed the Navidad and Silver banks north of the Dominican Republic; shoaling from the region's shallow waters temporarily interfered with measurements of surface winds. Convection around the storm's eye deepened and its eye became better defined that night, and the hurricane reached a secondary peak with sustained winds of 125 mph (205 km/h). Maria passed east of the Turks and Caicos Islands on September 22. An increase in southwesterly wind shear prompted gradual weakening of the hurricane, starting with restriction of banding features and later degradation of the eyewall. Late on September 22, the hurricane turned north-northwest as it reached the western periphery of the ridge previously steering it northwest. Maria fluctuated in organization throughout the day of September 23, with its eye periodically clearing and becoming cloud-filled; it maintained Category 3 hurricane strength during this phase. Despite a decreasing central pressure, the storm finally weakened to Category 2 strength at 06:00 UTC on September 24. Hurricane Hunters observed flight-level winds of ; however, surface wind returns by the NOAA's Stepped-Frequency Microwave Radiometer were only 90 mph (150 km/h), supportive of a lower intensity. This indicated below-average mixing down of winds aloft. By this time, Maria's trajectory had shifted almost due north between the aforementioned ridge and a cut-off low that was located over the eastern Gulf of Mexico. ==Demise== Weakening accelerated later on September 24 into September 25, as the hurricane traversed a cold wake‚Äîwith sea surface temperatures of ‚Äîcreated by Hurricane Jose a week prior. Maria degraded to Category 1 strength during this time. Early on September 25, Maria's structure changed dramatically as its inner-core collapsed. The low- level circulation became exposed to the northwest, and most of the deep convection shifted to the eastern half of the storm. However, a sustained convective burst maintained Maria's hurricane intensity, with banding features evident on the eastern part of the circulation. Despite this, northwesterly wind shear continued to impinge on the storm, and Maria weakened to a tropical storm early on September 28. Simultaneously, Maria began to accelerate to the east-northeast as it became embedded into the mid-latitude westerlies. Gradually weakening, Maria soon began to move over sea surface temperatures of and below, causing most of its convection to dissipate. Late on September 30, Maria transitioned into an extratropical cyclone. During the next couple of days, Maria's remnants accelerated east-northeastward towards the United Kingdom, while rapidly weakening. Maria's remnants later dissipated on October 2, to the southwest of Ireland. ==See also== * Hurricane Maria * Hurricane Marilyn ==References== Maria Category:Hurricane Maria ","title":"Meteorological history of Hurricane Maria"},{"id":"56074979","text":"Maialen Lujanbio (born 26 November 1976) is a Basque poet and bertsolari winner.

He had an older sister named Beth. Beckler was educated at Williams College (BA) and Fordham University School of Law (JD). Richard Beckler served in the U.S. Navy, Active Duty Officer from 1962-1970 and as Lieutenant Commander in the U.S. Naval Reserve (1965-1978). Richard Beckler served as Assistant District Attorney in the NY (Manhattan) County District Attorney's Office under District Attorney Frank Hogan (1968-1972). Beckler joined the U.S. Department of Justice, Fraud Section, in 1972. Beckler was promoted to and served as the Section Chief of the Criminal Fraud Section of the U.S. Department of Justice 1976-1979, where he headed a task force on foreign payment cases and worked closely with officials from the Department of the Treasury, the SEC and the Department of State. Mr. Beckler joined Fulbright & Jaworski as Head of the Washington Litigation Group from 1979-2003. He spent the next 37 years in white collar criminal defense for the firms Fulbright & Jaworski, Howrey LLP, and Bracewell & Giuliani mostly representing corporations such as Halliburton. Beckler also represented many individuals, including CIA Director William J. Casey. Beckler had also represented Iran-Contra figure John Poindexter. Before coming to the GSA, Beckler was a partner and head of litigation in Washington, D.C., for the international law firm Bracewell LLP. Mr. Beckler's appointment as GSA General Counsel was announced on May 12, 2017. ==Hospitalization & death== Beckler was hospitalized in September 2017 and died on 25 September, 2017, in Los Angeles. A memorial website reported that Beckler had died after \\"a grueling two-month battle with Pancreatic cancer\\". ==References *Richard Beckler videos at C-SPAN Category:1940 births Category:2017 deaths Category:Deaths from pancreatic cancer Category:Williams College alumni Category:Fordham University alumni Category:American lawyers ","title":"Richard Beckler"},{"id":"56075062","text":"Timing of breeding in birds relying on capital breeding. The dashed line shows an example of an individual increasing in condition, while the solid line shows the threshold of when the individual breeds.Timing of breeding in birds relying on income breeding. The dashed lines shows two examples of individuals increasing in condition (one faster than the other), while the solid line shows the threshold of when the individual breeds. Capital breeding and income breeding refer to the methods by which some organisms time breeding and use resources to finance breeding. In the models, capital breeders breed when they reach a threshold condition, which decreases throughout the breeding season. However, the original definition of a capital breeder has changed, with the more recent definition being organisms that use energy stores built up before reproduction to breed. This is in comparison to income breeders, who breed after certain levels, which do not change, of increase in condition are reached and who use energy gained during breeding to finance reproduction. Income breeders who are growing especially fast hold off the development of their offspring after a threshold is reached so they can produce more offspring, although this does not occur in slower growing income breeders. An organism can be both a capital and an income breeder; the parasitoid Eupelmus vuilletti, for example, is an income breeder in terms of sugars, but a capital breeder in terms of lipids. A different example of the interaction between capital and income breeding is found in Vipera aspis; although these snakes are capital breeders, they lay larger litters when food is abundant, which is a characteristic of income breeders. The dichotomy between income and capital breeders was introduced in 1980 by R. H. Drent and S. Daan to explain why birds usually laid their eggs later than the time that would maximize nestling survival for the population. Ectotherms are generally capital breeders, whereas endotherms rely on income breeding more often. This difference is likely due to the difference in maintenance costs, and thus in the energy that can be allocated to stores. ==Determinants of capital versus income breeding== In organisms that breed multiple times and live in places where food availability and mortality change significantly on the basis of season, it is predicted that capital breeding will be more prevalent, as the time when the organism is not breeding but when conditions are still favourable will be dedicated to rebuilding stores, therefore allowing them to achieve higher rates of reproduction. Capital breeding also increases with size (at least in organisms with optimal storage and indeterminate growth), as the energy dedicated to growth gives less and less return, thus meaning that energy dedicated to storage will have more return compared to that dedicated to growth. But, in eastern grey kangaroos, capital breeding is used during times of food scarcity, whereas income breeding is used during times of normal food availability. Income breeding, on the other hand, will generally be favoured in non-seasonal environments, as holding off breeding will not increase the chances that the offspring will survive. In addition, high or unpredictable demands during reproduction, which would cause the energy needed to exceed the energy provided by an income breeding strategy, may encourage capital breeding. Similarly, the possibility of decreased agility or increased conspicuity associated with, for example, egg-carrying could increase predation on reproducing individuals, making a strategy based on capital breeding more favourable, so as to avoid having to forage while reproducing. This model does not hold for organisms that have a feeding season right after the breeding season. Copepods, for example, have their breeding season just before the feeding season, and are primarily divided into mainly capital or mainly income breeders on the basis of geography. ==In endotherms== Endotherms have a higher level of energy that needs to be dedicated to maintenance, thus explaining their increased reliance on income breeding. ===In birds=== The terms capital breeding and income breeding originated to explain why most individuals lay after the time when nestlings are most likely to survive. Both systems fit with the optimal time of laying for low-quality and high-quality individuals. High-quality individuals may choose to hold off laying until another egg is produced, as the decrease in the likelihood of survival for each egg is compensated by the additional egg. This is the opposite in low- quality individuals, in which the time to make an extra egg decreases the survival of each egg to the point where an additional egg cannot compensate for this loss. ===In pinnipeds=== The reliance of capital and income breeding in pinnipeds primarily depends on the availability of food, with more food favouring an increased reliance on capital breeding. This is because increase food availability allows for the accumulation of capital, which allows for a species to use capital breeding, which is more efficient as there are less energetic costs associated with it. Increased seasonality is another factor in capital versus income breeding, with higher seasonality associated with an increased reliance on income breeding, for the reasons discussed previously. Increased unpredictability also affects a pinnipeds reliance on capital breeding; less predictability increase reliance on capital breeding, as a species can use its accumulated stores to breed when there is less food available, whereas an income breeder cannot. ==In ectotherms== Ectotherms are generally capital breeders, likely because of the fact that they have a lower level of body maintenance, meaning that more energy can be converted to body stores. ===In copepods=== Copepods generally have their reproduction strategy influenced by geography, with those at higher latitudes usually being capital breeders, and those in waters closer to the equator conforming to the income breeding strategy. This is because more temperate waters allow for a longer feeding season, which allows for multiple generations in income breeders (who reproduce during the feeding season), whereas colder seas with shorter feeding seasons favour capital breeders, who are not as much affected compared to income breeders by having to get their offspring to maturity before the feeding season ends. The length of the feeding season also selects for size in these organisms; income breeders are as small as possible so they can take advantage of having multiple generations per breeding season, in contrast with capital breeders, which are as large as possible so as to catch the most food to put into their reserves. ==References== Category:Reproduction ","title":"Capital and income breeding"},{"id":"56075113","text":"The Abner F.

His father died in an accident in 1902, resulting in Turner leaving school and finding a job. James never returned to school, and did not learn how to read. ==Career== J.L. Turner and Son Building Turner married in 1908 to Josephine Marcum. He decided to get into retail by opening a bridal shop with Josephine. The bridal shop lasted one year and they moved to Kentucky where he opened a country store. After four years the country store closed. After his country store closed down, Turner worked as a salesman for a wholesale grocery company and then a dry goods retailer in Nashville. During the Great Depression, Turner was a traveling salesman and liquidated merchandise of bankrupt general stores. The liquidated merchandise from these stores became part of Turners' own general store J.L. Turner and Son established in 1939 with his son, Cal Turner. After World War II, dry goods wholesaling declined leading James to shift his business to retail. The shift to retail led to J.L. Turner and Son reaching annual sales of over $2 million by the 1950s. J.L. Turner and Son grew to 35 department stores in Kentucky and Tennessee. On June 1, 1955 James and Cal opened the first Dollar General store in Springfield, Kentucky. ==Death== In 1964 James died at the age of 73. J.L.

If they fail to do so, they will faint from exhaustion.Greg Toppo, \\"Learn to ‚Äòlive deliberately‚Äô with ‚ÄòWalden‚Äô game on Thoreau‚Äôs birthday\\", USA Today The inspiration aspects of the game focus on several of the themes discussed in the later chapters of the book Walden‚Äîvisitors, sound, solitude and reading. Players can find inspiration by exploring the woods and interacting with animals (visitors), finding places of solitude, which are marked by cairns, listening to the sounds of civilization (wagons, a train whistle, church bells, etc.) that can be heard from the edges of the woods, and reading the books found throughout the woods. When the player is inspired, the colors and sounds of the game are richer, however if they let their inspiration fall, these colors and sounds will become dull.Alexander Stern, \\"In Walden the Video Game, You the Player Are Henry David Thoreau\\", Humanities Magazine In addition to care-taking survival and inspiration, the player may also explore Thoreau's world to discover a series of intertwined stories about his life and the tensions in the world around him that sent him to the woods for his experiment in self-reliant living. Letters and visits from his mentor Ralph Waldo Emerson explore his ambitions as a writer. A series of poetic clues from his sister Sophia lead the player to secret areas of the woods and to an understanding of a mutual tragedy. Other storylines follow Thoreau's involvement in the Abolitionist movement of the times, his work as a surveyor, and his connections to prominent scientist Louis Agassiz. \\"Playdate Podcast Interview Series\\" The game takes place over the course of the first year of Thoreau's stay in the woods, as does the book Walden.

He then joined the Al-Quwa Al-Jawiya youth team, and he represented them in the Al-Zawraa Youth Championship; he was top scorer at two local tournaments, and was then called up by the Iraq FA to play for Saad Hashim‚Äôs under-14 team, and with an outstanding performance, he grabbed the attention of the managers of Al-Shorta. ===Al-Shorta=== Early years On 24 September 2013, the player signed a five-year contract with Al-Shorta. His competitive debut for the club was under Brazilian coach Lorival Santos in the 2013‚Äì14 Iraqi Premier League wearing the number 26 shirt, being substituted onto the field on 85 minutes in the Baghdad Derby against Al-Talaba on 26 March 2014, making him the youngest player to represent Al-Shorta in the club's history at 13 years and 279 days old, and also the youngest player in the history of the Baghdad Derby matches. Al-Shorta won the league title with 43 points from 21 games, earning Mohanad his first honour at club level. In the 2014‚Äì15 season, Mohanad played in a four-team friendly competition called the Baghdad Cup, scoring a penalty in the semi-final shootout which Al-Shorta lost to Al-Quwa Al-Jawiya. Mohanad was given the number 8 shirt for the 2015‚Äì16 season under coach Hakeem Shaker and he scored his first goal for Al-Shorta on 20 September 2015 against Al-Sinaa in the 2015‚Äì16 Iraqi Premier League with a header. He made two starts and nine substitute appearances in the group stage of the league, where Al- Shorta finished 4th in Group 2 to qualify to the Elite Group. In the Elite Group, Al-Shorta finished in 7th position and Mohanad was used as a substitute for three of their six matches. He spent the 2016‚Äì17 season on loan at Baghdad club Al-Kahrabaa, and finished as the top scorer for the club with 12 goals in 31 league matches, including scoring four goals in the same match against Al- Karkh on 4 January. The club finished 13th in the league. 2017‚Äì18 season After the loan, he returned to Al-Shorta and renewed his contract in October 2017 for three years, taking the number 18 shirt. He scored his first two goals of the season against Naft Al-Junoob in a 2‚Äì1 victory in January 2018. He continued to score regularly throughout the season, forming a partnership with fellow striker Alaa Abdul-Zahra. He scored his first Baghdad Derby goal against Al-Zawraa on 20 January and scoring in another Baghdad Derby against Al-Talaba on 30 January. He finished his season with the team with 17 goals and assisted 8 times in 32 appearances in the league. The team finished in 4th position. 2018‚Äì19 season He began his season with his team with a new coach, Neboj≈°a Jovoviƒá, to exploit his speed as he also took on increasing defensive and creative duties. Mohanad scored his first goal and provided an assist in a 3‚Äì1 away win over Naft Al-Junoob on 21 October. He scored his second and third in a 3‚Äì0 win against Al-Sinaat Al-Kahrabaiya. On 7 November, Mohanad scored his fourth goal against former club Al-Kahrabaa. His fifth and sixth goal with his team came on 24 November including an impressive solo effort, and he scored another extraordinary goal against Al-Naft on 4 March 2019. Mohanad scored 20 goals and 10 assists in 31 games, he won league with the club. His good form at club level saw him on the radar of many of European and Asian clubs. After his successful 2019 AFC Asian Cup campaign with the national team, there were official offers made from Italian clubs Juventus and Cagliari, Czech club Slavia Prague, Danish club Midtjylland, Belgian club Genk, Turkish club Galatasaray, Greek club AEK Athens and Emirati club Al-Ain but Al-Shorta rejected the offers on 29 January 2019, meaning he would spend the rest of the season at Al-Shorta. The end of the winter transfer window did not stop clubs from expressing their interest in Mohanad, with Al-Shorta's vice-president Abdul-Wahab Al-Taei stating that offers had also now been made by English club Manchester City, Turkish clubs Fenerbah√ße, ƒ∞stanbul Ba≈üak≈üehir, Yeni Malatyaspor and Hatayspor, Russian club Akhmat Grozny, Qatari club Al-Wakrah and an unnamed Japanese club. After months of speculation about which club Mohanad would sign with, he completed a move to Qatari club Al-Duhail in July who agreed to pay an undisclosed fee, rumoured to be $2 million. ===Al-Duhail=== On 15 July 2019, he signed a five-year with Qatari side Al-Duhail. Mohanad made his debut for Al Duhail in the AFC Champions League against Al Sadd on 6 August, coming on as a second-half substitute. He scored his first goal with a solo effort after dribbling past Kara Mbodji and George Kwasi in the 89th minute on 3 October, coming on as a substitute in 71st minutes, in a 2‚Äì1 home win against Al- Sailiya. Portimonense (loan) On 30 January 2020, he was sent on loan to Primeira Liga side Portimonense for the rest of the 2019‚Äì20 season. Nineteen days later, Mohanad joined the team. He made a debut on 23 February, coming on as a late substitute for Bruno Tabata in a 0‚Äì1 away loss against Porto. On 29 August 2020, he joined Al-Sailiya on loan in Qatar. Mohanad scored on his debut in a 1‚Äì1 draw against Al-Rayyan on 3 September. ==International careerYouth=== Mohanad made his debut for Iraq's Under-14s in 2013 at the age of just 13. He was the joint-top scorer at the 2013 Asian Youth Games with six goals in Nanjing in August 2013, where the Iraq U-14s beat Singapore, Kuwait and Thailand in the quarterfinals before they lost to Iran in the semis and the third and fourth match on penalties to North Korea. In the first ever edition of the AFC U-14 Championship in 2014, Mohanad won the top scorer award with six goals and his team won the cup. In the 2015 WAFF U-16 Championship, Mohanad won the top scorer award with five goals and his team won the championship. ===Senior=== He played his first match for the Iraq national team in a friendly against United Arab Emirates on 17 December 2017, however the match was not counted as an official international game, and so his official debut came against Bahrain in the 23rd Arabian Gulf Cup on 23 December 2017. He scored for Iraq in an unofficial friendly game against Iraqi Premier League club Naft Al-Junoob on 24 February 2018. His first and second international goals for Iraq were in a friendly match against Saudi Arabia on 28 February 2018. He played against Argentina on 11 October 2018, coming on as a second-half substitute. He was nominated by the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) as one of the top young talents; he was described as the youngest player who has the potential to changing the shape of the game before 2019 AFC Asian Cup. He scored his seventh goal against Vietnam on 8 January 2019, and his eighth against Yemen on 12 January 2019, followed by a goal against Jordan to help Iraq win the 2019 International Friendship Championship. Mohanad went on to score five more goals by the end of 2019. After his performance at the 2019 AFC Asian Cup and 2022 FIFA World Cup qualification, he was voted the 2019 West Asian Footballer of the Year and was also included in Chinese newspaper Titan Sports \\"Best Footballer in Asia 2019\\", which listed 26 of best footballers. ==Style of play== Mohanad is talented player with good technique and close control, who is an adept header of the ball, and who has an ability to score impressive goals, in the air or with either foot, courtesy of his shooting ability and positional sense. He is physically strong, and is gifted with dribbling skills, anticipation, and confidence in going at opponents with numerical superiority. He is also known for his speed, and his ability beat defenders with sudden turns, as well as his vision, which gave him the ability to link-up with and provide assists for teammates. ==Personal life== The former international striker Ali Salah is one of his cousins. Mohanad played under the name of his brother Hassan Ali during the 2015‚Äì16 season with Al-Shorta and the 2016‚Äì17 season with Al-Kahrabaa. While at Al-Kahrabaa, he told the Football-IQ newspaper: \\"My official data and official documents in the records of the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) are under the name Mohanad Ali, which is my real name. All it is is that an error in my personal data then led to me being called the name Hassan. I do not want to return to this issue which bothered me a lot, especially after my forms have been resolved by legal means\\". Football-IQ confirmed later in the year that an Iraqi court had ruled that his AFC documents under the name Mohanad Ali were correct and that his year of birth was 2000 and not 1997 as had been rumoured, granting him the right to cancel his erroneous passport and obtain a new corrected one, thus allowing him to represent Iraq again. ==Career statisticsClub=== {  style=\\"text-align: center\\" - !rowspan=\\"2\\"Club !rowspan=\\"2\\"Season !colspan=\\"3\\"League !colspan=\\"2\\"Cup !colspan=\\"2\\"Continental !colspan=\\"2\\"Other !colspan=\\"2\\"Total - !Division!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals - rowspan=\\"6\\"Al-Shorta 2013‚Äì14 rowspan=\\"5\\"IPL 10colspan=\\"2\\"‚Äî00colspan=\\"2\\"‚Äî10 - 2014‚Äì15 00colspan=\\"2\\"‚Äî00colspan=\\"2\\"‚Äî00 - 2015‚Äì16 141colspan=\\"2\\"‚Äîcolspan=\\"2\\"‚Äîcolspan=\\"2\\"‚Äî141 - 2017‚Äì18 3217colspan=\\"2\\"‚Äîcolspan=\\"2\\"‚Äîcolspan=\\"2\\"‚Äî3217 - 2018‚Äì19 301911colspan=\\"2\\"‚Äîcolspan=\\"2\\"‚Äî3120 - !colspan=\\"2\\"Total !77!!37!!1!!1!!0!!0!!0!!0!!78!!38 - Al-Kahrabaa (loan) 2016‚Äì17 IPL 311220colspan=\\"2\\"‚Äîcolspan=\\"2\\"‚Äî3312 - Al-Duhail 2019‚Äì20 QSL 91102010131 - Portimonense (loan) 2019‚Äì20 Primeira Liga 60colspan=\\"2\\"‚Äîcolspan=\\"2\\"‚Äîcolspan=\\"2\\"‚Äî60 - Al-Sailiya (loan) 2020‚Äì21 QSL 3300colspan=\\"2\\"‚Äî0033 - !colspan=\\"3\\"Career total !126!!53!!4!!1!!2!!0!!1!!0!!133!!54 } ===International=== {  !colspan=\\"3\\"Iraq national team - !Year!!Apps!!Goals - 201710 - 2018106 - 2019178 - !Total2814 } ===International goals=== :Scores and results list Iraq's goal tally first. {  !

It is the topological analogue of runcination, a geometric operation on polyhedra. Graph-encoded maps were formulated and named by . Alternative and equivalent systems for representing cellular embeddings include signed rotation systems and ribbon graphs. The graph-encoded map for an embedded graph G is another cubic graph H together with a 3-edge-coloring of H. Each edge e of G is expanded into exactly four vertices in H, one for each choice of a side and endpoint of the edge. An edge in H connects each such vertex to the vertex representing the opposite side and same endpoint of e; these edges are by convention colored red. Another edge in H connects each vertex to the vertex representing the opposite endpoint and same side of e; these edges are by convention colored blue. An edge in H of the third color, yellow, connects each vertex to the vertex representing another edge e' that meets e at the same side and endpoint. An alternative description of H is that it has a vertex for each flag of G (a mutually incident triple of a vertex, edge, and face). If (v,e,f) is a flag, then there is exactly one vertex v', edge e', and face f' such that (v',e,f), (v,e',f), and (v,e,f') are also flags. The three colors of edges in H represent each of these three types of flags that differ by one of their three elements. However, interpreting a graph-encoded map in this way requires more care. When the same face appears on both sides of an edge, as can happen for instance for a planar embedding of a tree, the two sides give rise to different gem vertices. And when the same vertex appears at both endpoints of a self-loop, the two ends of the edge again give rise to different gem vertices. In this way, each triple (v,e,f) may be associated with up to four different vertices of the gem. Whenever a cubic graph H can be 3-edge-colored so that the red-blue cycles of the coloring all have length four, the colored graph can be interpreted as a graph-encoded map, and represents an embedding of another graph G. To recover G and its embedding, interpret each 2-colored cycle of H as the face of an embedding of H onto a surface, contract each red--yellow cycle into a single vertex of G, and replace each pair of parallel blue edges left by the contraction with a single edge of G. The dual graph of a graph-encoded map may be obtained from the map by recoloring it so that the red edges of the gem become blue and the blue edges become red., pp. 111‚Äì112. ==References== Category:Topological graph theory ","title":"Graph-encoded map"},{"id":"56075265","text":"Acadian belts at the end of the Caledonian orogeny (Early Devonian). Present day coastlines are indicated in gray for reference. Note, that the North- German‚ÄìPolish Caledonides were not formed during the Scandian orogeny but during the \\"soft docking\\" of East Avalonia to Baltica at about 443 Ma. The Acadian orogeny resulted from the prolonged collision of the \\"peri-Gondwanan terranes\\" with the Laurentian autochthon. Later in geological history, the North Atlantic Ocean opened and the different parts of the orogenic belt moved apart. See also Iapetus Suture and Trans-European Suture Zone. The Scandinavian Caledonides are the vestiges of an ancient, today deeply eroded orogenic belt formed during the Silurian‚ÄìDevonian continental collision of Baltica and Laurentia, which is referred to as the Scandian phase of the Caledonian orogeny. The size of the Scandinavian Caledonides at the time of their formation can be compared with the size of the Himalayas. The area east of the Scandinavian Caledonides, including parts of Finland, developed into a foreland basin where old rocks and surfaces were covered by sediments. Today, the Scandinavian Caledonides underlay most of the western and northern Scandinavian Peninsula, whereas other parts of the Caledonides can be traced into West and Central Europe as well as parts of Greenland and eastern North America. == Plate-tectonic history == The Caledonian Wilson cycle commenced with the continental break-up of Rodinia and the opening of the Iapetus ocean about 616‚Äì583 Ma (mega-annum) ago. The Iapetus was at its widest in the Late Cambrian‚ÄìEarly Ordovician before it began to close by subduction of Iapetus crust along the Gondawanan and Laurentian margins starting between 500‚Äì488 Ma ago. Subduction of Iapteus crust continued until about 430 Ma ago until the final continental collision of Laurentia with Baltica, i.e. the Scandian phase of the Caledonian orogeny. The time of the continental collision is estimated by the cessation of subduction-related magmatism and a common apparent polar wander path (APWP) for Laurentia and Baltica. During the collision, the Baltican continental margin was deeply subducted beneath Laurentia and eclogitized. The time of the maximal burial of the Baltican margin is estimated at about 410 Ma ago by radiometric age dating of the ultra-high pressure (UHP) metamorphism in the Western Gneiss Region (WGR). Also during the collision, the Caledonian allochthons were thrust over the Baltican margin. Peak metamorphism in the allochthons is estimated to have occurred somewhat earlier than in the autochthon at about 420 Ma ago. Following the subduction of the Baltican continental margin and thrusting of the nappes over the Baltican basement, the orogen began to collapse in the Early Devonian, which was associated with extensional tectonics and sinistral motion between the Laurentian and Baltican tectonic plates. ==Disposition of rocks== profile of the Scandinavian Caledonides near Tornetr√§sk in northernmost Sweden. Each nappe is shown with a different colour. Arrows show the relative movement of each nappe. The d√©collement plane is shown as black dented line. Note the general movement towards the southeast. The Caledonian orogeny put in place most of the bedrock now seen in the Scandinavian Mountains. Caledonian rocks overlie rocks of the much older Svecokarelian and Sveconorwegian provinces. The Caledonian rocks form large nappes () that have been thrust over the older rocks. Much of the Caledonian rocks have been eroded since they were put in place meaning that they were once thicker and more contiguous. It is also implied from the erosion that the nappes of Caledonian rock originally reached further east than they do today. The erosion has left remaining massifs of Caledonian rocks and windows of Precambrian-aged rock. While there are some disagreements, geologists generally recognize four units among the nappes: an Uppermost, an Upper, a Middle and a Lower one. The last one is made up Ediacaran (Vendian), Cambrian, Ordovician and Silurian-aged sedimentary rocks. Pieces of Precambrian shield rocks are in some places also incorporated into the Lower nappes. == Present-day topography of Scandinavia == Despite occurring in roughly the same area, the ancient Scandinavian Caledonian Mountains and the modern Scandinavian Mountains are not synonymous. The overlap between the Scandinavian Caledonides and the Scandinavian Mountains has led to various suggestions that the modern Scandinavian Mountains are a remnant of the Caledonide mountains. A version of this argument was put forward in 2009 with the claim that the uplift of the mountains was attained by buoyancy of the surviving \\"mountain roots\\" of the Caledonian orogen. This concept has been criticized because there is only a tiny \\"mountain root\\" beneath the southern Scandinavian Mountains and no \\"root\\" at all in the north. Further, the Caledonian Mountains in Scandinavia are known to have undergone orogenic collapse for a long period starting in the Devonian. Another problem with this model is that it does not explain why other former mountains dating back to the Caledonian orogeny are eroded and buried in sediments and not uplifted by their \\"roots\\". Others claim that molten magma exists below the Caledonides of Norway, causing the uplift.https://www.volcanocafe.org/the- lost-volcanoes-of-norway/ ==See also== *Caledonian rocks of northern Finland *Origin of the Scandinavian Mountains *Timanide Orogen *Weichselian glaciation == Notes References== Category:Orogenies of Europe Category:Ordovician orogenies Category:Silurian orogenies Category:Devonian orogenies Category:Paleozoic Europe Category:Geology of Norway Category:Geology of Finland Category:Geology of Sweden Category:Ordovician Norway Category:Silurian Norway Category:Devonian Norway ","title":"Scandinavian Caledonides"},{"id":"56075271","text":"Alexandr Mikhailovich Dobrolyubov () (1876 ‚Äî summer or autumn 1945) was a Russian Symbolist poet, well known mostly for his creative energy rather than his poetry. == External links == * Aleksandr Dobrolubov: Russia's Mystic Pilgrim, A biography by Daniel H.

From the age of thirteen, her popularity has increased, especially through YouTube and social media, attracting the attention of notable musicians and guitar manufacturers. Originally from the Paris region, she received classical guitar lessons at the age of 6, and later studied under jazz-rock guitarist Renaud Louis-Servais. At the age of 9, she covered the classic version of \\"Hotel California\\" by the Eagles and at 13 she began to specialise in electric rock. Setkic started a YouTube channel in 2007 (at age 8) and in 2013 uploaded a video of her cover of Eddie Van Halen's guitar solo Eruption. Within a week, this video was seen four million times and in the following two years had been watched eleven million times. In the same year, she took up Antonio Vivaldi's third movement, \\"Presto\\", from the Concerto No. 2 in G minor, op. 8, RV 315, better known as the Summer of Four Seasons (the piece was adapted for the electric guitar by Patrick Rondat in 1996). In March 2015, she played Through the Fire and Flames, by the British band DragonForce.

Setkic has not uploaded any videos since late 2016 but by 2020 she had amassed a total of 162 million views. Setkic is a featured artist of the French guitar manufacturer Vigier Guitars, and her playing has been noticed by bassist Wolfgang Van Halen.

Several thousand are now used in English as spoken internationally. Some words are only used within North American English and American English. ==Creation of an American lexicon== The process of coining new lexical items started as soon as the colonists began borrowing names for unfamiliar flora, fauna, and topography from the Native American languages. Examples of such names are opossum, raccoon, squash and moose (from Algonquian). Other Native American loanwords, such as wigwam or moccasin, describe articles in common use among Native Americans. The languages of the other colonizing nations also added to the American vocabulary; for instance, cookie, cruller, stoop, and pit (of a fruit) from Dutch; angst, kindergarten, sauerkraut from German, levee, portage (\\"carrying of boats or goods\\") and (probably) gopher from French; barbecue, stevedore, and rodeo from Spanish. Among the earliest and most notable regular \\"English\\" additions to the American vocabulary, dating from the early days of colonization through the early 19th century, are terms describing the features of the North American landscape; for instance, run, branch, fork, snag, bluff, gulch, neck (of the woods), barrens, bottomland, notch, knob, riffle, rapids, watergap, cutoff, trail, timberline and divide. Already existing words such as creek, slough, sleet and (in later use) watershed received new meanings that were unknown in England. Other noteworthy American toponyms are found among loanwords; for example, prairie, butte (French); bayou (Choctaw via Louisiana French); coulee (Canadian French, but used also in Louisiana with a different meaning); canyon, mesa, arroyo (Spanish); vlei, skate, kill (Dutch, Hudson Valley). The word corn, used in England to refer to wheat (or any cereal), came to denote the plant Zea mays, the most important crop in the U.S., originally named Indian corn by the earliest settlers; wheat, rye, barley, oats, etc. came to be collectively referred to as grain. Other notable farm related vocabulary additions were the new meanings assumed by barn (not only a building for hay and grain storage, but also for housing livestock) and team (not just the horses, but also the vehicle along with them), as well as, in various periods, the terms range, (corn) crib, truck, elevator, sharecropping and feedlot. Ranch, later applied to a house style, derives from Mexican Spanish; most Spanish contributions came after the War of 1812, with the opening of the West. Among these are, other than toponyms, chaps (from chaparreras), plaza, lasso, bronco, buckaroo, rodeo; examples of \\"English\\" additions from the cowboy era are bad man, maverick, chuck (\\"food\\") and Boot Hill; from the California Gold Rush came such idioms as hit pay dirt or strike it rich. The word blizzard probably originated in the West. A couple of notable late 18th century additions are the verb belittle and the noun bid, both first used in writing by Thomas Jefferson. With the new continent developed new forms of dwelling, and hence a large inventory of words designating real estate concepts (land office, lot, outlands, waterfront, the verbs locate and relocate, betterment, addition, subdivision), types of property (log cabin, adobe in the 18th century; frame house, apartment, tenement house, shack, shanty in the 19th century; project, condominium, townhouse, split-level, mobile home, multi-family in the 20th century), and parts thereof (driveway, breezeway, backyard, dooryard; clapboard, siding, trim, baseboard; stoop (from Dutch), family room, den; and, in recent years, HVAC, central air, walkout basement). Ever since the American Revolution, a great number of terms connected with the U.S. political institutions have entered the language; examples are run (i.e, for office), gubernatorial, primary election, carpetbagger (after the Civil War), repeater, lame duck (a British term used originally in Banking) and pork barrel. Some of these are internationally used (for example, caucus, gerrymander, filibuster, exit poll). ===19th century onwards=== The development of material innovations during the Industrial Revolution throughout the 19th and 20th centuries was the source of a massive stock of distinctive new concepts, with their accompanying new words, phrases and idioms. Typical examples are the vocabulary of railroading (see further at rail terminology) and transportation terminology, ranging from names of roads (from dirt roads and back roads to freeways and parkways) to road infrastructure (parking lot, overpass, rest area), and from automotive terminology to public transit (for example, in the sentence \\"riding the subway downtown\\"); such American introductions as commuter (from commutation ticket), concourse, to board (a vehicle), to park, double-park and parallel park (a car), double decker or the noun terminal have long been used in all dialects of English.A few of these are now chiefly found, or have been more productive, outside the U.S.; for example, jump, \\"to drive past a traffic signal\\"; block meaning \\"building\\", and center, \\"central point in a town\\" or \\"main area for a particular activity\\" (cf. Oxford English Dictionary). Trades of various kinds have endowed (American) English with household words describing jobs and occupations (bartender, longshoreman, patrolman, hobo, bouncer, bellhop, roustabout, white collar, blue collar, employee, boss [from Dutch], intern, busboy, mortician, senior citizen), businesses and workplaces (department store, supermarket, thrift store, gift shop, drugstore, motel, main street, gas station, hardware store, savings and loan, hock [also from Dutch]), as well as general concepts and innovations (automated teller machine, smart card, cash register, dishwasher, reservation [as at hotels], pay envelope, movie, mileage, shortage, outage, blood bank). Already existing English words‚Äîsuch as store, shop, dry goods, haberdashery, lumber‚Äîunderwent shifts in meaning; some‚Äîsuch as mason, student, clerk, the verbs can (as in \\"canned goods\\"), ship, fix, carry, enroll (as in school), run (as in \\"run a business\\"), release and haul‚Äîwere given new significations, while others (such as tradesman) have retained meanings that disappeared in England. From the world of business and finance came break-even, merger, delisting, downsize, disintermediation, bottom line; from sports terminology came, jargon aside, Monday-morning quarterback, cheap shot, game plan (football); in the ballpark, out of left field, off base, hit and run, and many other idioms from baseball; gamblers coined bluff, blue chip, ante, bottom dollar, raw deal, pass the buck, ace in the hole, freeze-out, showdown; miners coined bedrock, bonanza, peter out, pan out and the verb prospect from the noun; and railroadmen are to be credited with make the grade, sidetrack, head-on, and the verb railroad. A number of Americanisms describing material innovations remained largely confined to North America: elevator, ground, gasoline; many automotive terms fall in this category, although many do not (hatchback, sport utility vehicle, station wagon, tailgate, motorhome, truck, pickup truck, to exhaust). In addition to the above-mentioned loans from French, Spanish, Mexican Spanish, Dutch, and Native American languages, other accretions from foreign languages came with 19th and early 20th century immigration; notably, from Yiddish (chutzpah, schmooze, tush) and German‚Äîhamburger and culinary terms like frankfurter/franks, liverwurst, sauerkraut, wiener, deli(catessen); scram, kindergarten, gesundheit; musical terminology (whole note, half note, etc.); and apparently cookbook, fresh (\\"impudent\\") and what gives? Such constructions as Are you coming with? and I like to dance (for \\"I like dancing\\") may also be the result of German or Yiddish influence.Trudgill, Peter (2004). New-Dialect Formation: The Inevitability of Colonial Englishes. Finally, a large number of English colloquialisms from various periods are American in origin; some have lost their American flavor (from OK and cool to nerd and 24/7), while others have not (have a nice day, for sure); many are now distinctly old-fashioned (swell, groovy). Some English words now in general use, such as hijacking, disc jockey, boost, bulldoze and jazz, originated as American slang. Among the many English idioms of U.S. origin are get the hang of, bark up the wrong tree, keep tabs, run scared, take a backseat, have an edge over, stake a claim, take a shine to, in on the ground floor, bite off more than one can chew, off/on the wagon, stay put, inside track, stiff upper lip, bad hair day, throw a monkey wrench/monkeywrenching, under the weather, jump bail, come clean, come again?, it ain't over till it's over, and what goes around comes around. ==Morphology== American English has always shown a marked tendency to use nouns as verbs.Trudgill, p. 69. Examples of verbed nouns are interview, advocate, vacuum, lobby, pressure, rear-end, transition, feature, profile, spearhead, skyrocket, showcase, service (as a car), corner, torch, exit (as in \\"exit the lobby\\"), factor (in mathematics), gun (\\"shoot\\"), author (which disappeared in English around 1630 and was revived in the U.S. three centuries later) and, out of American material, proposition, graft (bribery), bad-mouth, vacation, major, backpack, backtrack, intern, ticket (traffic violations), hassle, blacktop, peer-review, dope and OD, and, of course verbed as used at the start of this sentence. Compounds coined in the U.S. are for instance foothill, flatlands, badlands, landslide (in all senses), overview (the noun), backdrop, teenager, brainstorm, bandwagon, hitchhike, smalltime, deadbeat, frontman, lowbrow and highbrow, hell-bent, foolproof, nitpick, about-face (later verbed), upfront (in all senses), fixer-upper, no-show; many of these are phrases used as adverbs or (often) hyphenated attributive adjectives: non- profit, for-profit, free-for-all, ready-to-wear, catchall, low-down, down-and- out, down and dirty, in-your-face, nip and tuck; many compound nouns and adjectives are open: happy hour, fall guy, capital gain, road trip, wheat pit, head start, plea bargain; some of these are colorful (empty nester, loan shark, ambulance chaser, buzz saw, ghetto blaster, dust bunny), others are euphemistic (differently abled (physically challenged), human resources, affirmative action, correctional facility). Many compound nouns have the form verb plus preposition: add-on, stopover, lineup, shakedown, tryout, spin-off, rundown (\\"summary\\"), shootout, holdup, hideout, comeback, cookout, kickback, makeover, takeover, rollback (\\"decrease\\"), rip-off, come-on, shoo-in, fix-up, tie-in, tie-up (\\"stoppage\\"), stand-in. These essentially are nouned phrasal verbs; some prepositional and phrasal verbs are in fact of American origin (spell out, figure out, hold up, brace up, size up, rope in, back up/off/down/out, step down, miss out, kick around, cash in, rain out, check in and check out (in all senses), fill in (\\"inform\\"), kick in or throw in (\\"contribute\\"), square off, sock in, sock away, factor in/out, come down with, give up on, lay off (from employment), run into and across (\\"meet\\"), stop by, pass up, put up (money), set up (\\"frame\\"), trade in, pick up on, pick up after, lose out).British author George Orwell (in English People, 1947, cited in OED s.v. lose) criticized an alleged \\"American tendency\\" to \\"burden every verb with a preposition that adds nothing to its meaning (win out, lose out, face up to, etc.)\\". Noun endings such as -ee (retiree), -ery (bakery), -ster (gangster) and -cian (beautician) are also particularly productive. Some verbs ending in -ize are of U.S. origin; for example, fetishize, prioritize, burglarize, accessorize, itemize, editorialize, customize, notarize, weatherize, winterize, Mirandize; and so are some back-formations (locate, fine-tune, evolute, curate, donate, emote, upholster, peeve and enthuse). Among syntactical constructions that arose in the U.S. are as of (with dates and times), outside of, headed for, meet up with, back of, convince someone to, not about to and lack for. Americanisms formed by alteration of some existing words include notably pesky, phony, rambunctious, pry (as in \\"pry open\\", from prize), putter (verb), buddy, sundae, skeeter, sashay and kitty- corner. Adjectives that arose in the U.S. are for example, lengthy, bossy, cute and cutesy, grounded (of a child), punk (in all senses), sticky (of the weather), through (as in \\"through train\\", or meaning \\"finished\\"), and many colloquial forms such as peppy or wacky. American blends include motel, guesstimate, infomercial and televangelist. ==English words that survived in the United States and not in the United Kingdom== A number of words and meanings that originated in Middle English or Early Modern English and that have been in everyday use in the United States dropped out in most varieties of British English; some of these have cognates in Lowland Scots. Terms such as fall (\\"autumn\\"), faucet (\\"tap\\"), diaper (\\"nappy\\"), candy (\\"sweets\\"), skillet, eyeglasses and obligate are often regarded as Americanisms. Fall for example came to denote the season in 16th century England, a contraction of Middle English expressions like \\"fall of the leaf\\" and \\"fall of the year\\". During the 17th century, English immigration to the British colonies in North America was at its peak and the new settlers took the English language with them. While the term fall gradually became obsolete in Britain, it became the more common term in North America. Gotten (past participle of get) is often considered to be an Americanism, although there are some areas of Britain, such as Lancashire and North East England, that still continue to use it and sometimes also use putten as the past participle for put (which is not done by most speakers of American English).A Handbook of Varieties of English, Bernd Kortmann & Edgar W. Schneider, Walter de Gruyter, 2004, p. 115. Other words and meanings, to various extents, were brought back to Britain, especially in the second half of the 20th century; these include hire (\\"to employ\\"), quit (\\"to stop\\", which spawned quitter in the U.S.), I guess (famously criticized by H. W. Fowler), baggage, hit (a place), and the adverbs overly and presently (\\"currently\\"). Some of these, for example monkey wrench and wastebasket, originated in 19th century Britain. The mandative subjunctive (as in \\"the City Attorney suggested that the case not be closed\\") is livelier in American English than it is in British English. It appears in some areas as a spoken usage and is considered obligatory in contexts that are more formal. The adjectives mad meaning \\"angry\\", smart meaning \\"intelligent\\", and sick meaning \\"ill\\" are also more frequent in American (these meanings are also frequent in Hiberno-English) than British English. ==Regionally distinct vocabulary within the United States== Linguist Bert Vaux created a survey, completed in 2003, polling English speakers across the United States about the specific words they would use in everyday speech for various concepts.Vaux, Bert and Scott Golder. 2003. The Harvard Dialect Survey . Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Linguistics Department. This 2003 study concluded that: *For a \\"long sandwich that contains cold cuts, lettuce, and so on\\", the most common term found in the survey, throughout the country (preferred by 77% of the participants), was the word sub (an abbreviation for submarine sandwich). The New York metropolitan area shows the greatest variety of terms for this idea in one single region, largely counting for the 5% of the survey who preferred the term hero, nearly 7% (which is even more prevalent in the Pittsburgh and Philadelphia metropolitan areas, including southern New Jersey as well as eastern Pennsylvania) who preferred hoagie, and just less than 3% (also notably prevalent throughout New England, except Maine) who prefer grinder. *The U.S. is largely divided about the \\"generic term for a sweetened carbonated beverage\\". Nearly 53% of the surveyed sample preferred soda, particularly in the Northeast, eastern Wisconsin, Greater St. Louis, the far West, and some of South Florida, with it also called tonic in some parts of southeastern New England. Over 25% preferred pop, particularly around the Midwest (including the Great Lakes region) and the Western regions along the Canada‚ÄìUnited States border. Over 12% preferred coke (which is also trademarked for a specific cola product), particularly scattered throughout the South. Urban, coastal California speakers use all three terms, though especially soda. Speakers of the West generally use soda or pop.Katz, Joshua (2013). \\"Beyond 'Soda, Pop, or Coke.' North Carolina State University. *The most common word or phrase \\"to address a group of two or more people\\" (in the second person) was you guys at almost 43%, particularly throughout the Northeast and Great Lakes region (along with simply you at nearly 13%). Y'all was preferred by 14%, particularly in the South, but reaching somewhat noticeably into the Northern regions as well. Yous(e) was largely confined to the New York and Philadelphia metropolitan areas, at just over 0.5%. The expression \\"yinz\\" is a distinctive feature of Western Pennsylvania speech. *The most common term for generic, rubber-soled shoes worn for athletic activities is sneakers as said by 46% of those surveyed throughout the country, but particularly in the Northeast. 41%, particularly outside the Northeast, said tennis shoes. Several much rarer other terms were also documented in various regions of the country. *Nearly 68% of the participating speakers make no distinction between dinner and supper, or simply never use the term supper. *64% of the participants said they use \\"Where are you at?\\" to mean \\"How are you coming along?\\" This also incorporated the 34% who use \\"Where are you at?\\" in any context, for example, to even mean \\"Where are you physically located right now?\\" *Freshwater \\"miniature lobsters\\" were identified by 40% of polled speakers as crawfish, 32% as crayfish, and 19% as crawdads within no particular regional boundaries, except that crayfish was especially uncommon in the South. 5% reported having no term for this animal. *The most common nicknames for grandparents were grandpa/grampa and grandma/gramma. *Nearly all American English speakers called the lampyrid insect a firefly or lightning bug, with nearly 40% using the two terms interchangeably. *The use of the word anymore with a positive sense, simply as a synonym for nowadays (e.g. I do only figurative paintings anymore), was reported as sounding acceptable to 5% of participants. However, in example sentences with a clearly disheartened tone or dismissive attitude, the positive use of anymore sounded acceptable to as many as 29% of participants (e.g. Forget your baby wearing nice clothes anymore). This rare use of the word was observed much more around Pennsylvania and going westward into the Midland region. *The \\"wheeled contraption\\" for carrying groceries was identified by 77% of participants as a shopping cart and by nearly 14% as a grocery cart. 4% preferred the term buggy: a clearly Southern phenomenon. ==References== Category:English language Category:American English ","title":"American English vocabulary"},{"id":"56075527","text":"The Transfer Station Fire was a wildfire five miles east of Eagar, Arizona in the United States.

It was across from Sunnyside Amusement Park and beside the Roncesvalles Carhouse. The station was owned and operated by Gray Coach bus lines, a subsidiary of the Toronto Transit Commission, that operated interurban bus routes connecting Toronto with outlying areas throughout southern Ontario. No route actually began or ended at the terminal, which was used as a rest stop and drop off and pick up point by Gray Coach and Greyhound routes heading west from Toronto to locations such as London, Ontario, Hamilton, Ontario, Niagara Falls, Ontario, or Buffalo, New York. The terminal was also a point of departure for shuttle buses to various racetracks, such as Fort Erie, Long Branch or Woodbine. The terminal declined in usage following the creation of GO Transit in 1967, particularly after GO stopped contracting several of its routes to Gray Coach in the 1980s. The station was opened in 1936, on what was then the western edge of Toronto, and was constructed in an art deco style, including a steel canopy. The station had a ticket booth, restrooms, a waiting room, and, at its opening, the B&G; Coffee Shop and Milk Bar. The coffee shop was operated by a succession of tenants throughout the station's existence and later housed the TEOEL Travel Bureau. The Edgewater Hotel was built next to the bus station on the north-west corner of the intersection in the 1930s, opening in 1939.http://www.blogto.com/city/2009/05/the_corner_of_roncesvalles_and_queen/ The station was also served by both the King and Queen streetcars. Until its closure in 1967, the Sunnyside railway station across the street provided commuters with a connection to the Canadian National Railway. GO Transit was created in 1967 and took over CN's Toronto to Hamilton route replacing it with the Lakeshore West line which bypassed Sunnyside rail station thus reducing the use of Sunnyside as an intermodal transfer point between rail and coach routes. The rail station closed entirely in 1971 and was demolished in 1973. Sunnyside Bus Terminal did not have any bus bays. Buses serving the station stopped at the curb, on Queen Street (later known as the Queensway), outside the station, beside the Roncesvalles Carhouse. Gray Coach was sold in 1990 to Stagecoach and in 1992 was acquired by Greyhound Canada.Acquisitions by Stagecoach, April 1987 to May 1995 Competition CommissionHistorical Timeline Greyhound Canada The Sunnyside Bus Terminal was closed around the same time. The building still stands and retains its steel canopy. Still owned by the Toronto Transit Commission, the building was rented out as a donut shop for several years after Gray Coach's closure before becoming a McDonald's.http://www.blogto.com/city/2016/01/the_story_of_torontos_lost_art_deco_bus_terminal/ ==See also== *Toronto Coach Terminal, also built for and originally operated by Gray Coach in 1931. ==References== Category:Bus stations in Ontario Category:Transport in Toronto Category:Art Deco architecture in Canada Category:Buildings and structures in Toronto Category:Transport infrastructure completed in 1936 ","title":"Sunnyside Bus Terminal"},{"id":"56075567","text":"Johnny Patterson (died July 5, 1969) was a NASCAR Grand National Series driver from Huntington, West Virginia. ==Summary== He drove from 1952 to 1959 and scored four \\"top five\\" finishes and six \\"top ten\\" finishes.

He completed postgraduate studies in East Germany at the in Berlin and at the between 1969 and 1971. Cup√≠ degli Uccelli, Uruguay pavilion at the Venice Biennale, 2001 Anacahuita, la pimienta de los pobres, installation, , M√©xico, 2014 Teaching work has been present in his artistic career since the 1970s in the and several workshops in Uruguay and the United States. He has been a teacher of artists who have managed to develop solid personal careers such as Gladys Afamado, Margaret Whyte, and Marco Maggi. He conducts training workshops on graphic techniques in Montevideo every year, as well as curating exhibitions in Uruguay and abroad, in the quest to revalue engraving as a creative discipline and a platform for contemporary expression for the new generations of artists in his country. He is a tenured professor at the State University of New York at New Paltz, where he is responsible for the direction of the graphic arts department. In 1997 he was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship. In 2001 he represented Uruguay at the Venice Biennale. In 2002 he received the Figari Award in recognition of his career. In 2004 he was awarded the Chancellor's Award and the Prize for Artistic and Scientific Research. He exhibited at the Binghamton University Art Museum (2013) and the Medieval Trinitarian Templespace of the Kiscell Museum, Budapest, Hungary (2010), among other outstanding museums and galleries in various countries. In 2003 he was invited by the Tate Modern in London to give a conference and present a video about his creations. In 2004 the Samuel Dorsky Art Museum of SUNY New Paltz organized the first retrospective of Cardillo's work. In 2011 the Nassau County Museum of Art in Long Island held the retrospective exhibition \\"Jornadas de la memoria\\", which included works by the artist over four decades. ==Work== Cardillo has developed a varied series of works that include engravings, sculptures, and installations, where the study of nature and the preservation of his imprint has always been present. His sculptures and installations evoke archaeological sites that revalue the pre-Hispanic imaginary of Uruguayan territory with aesthetic representations - symbols of funerary mounds that allow recreating the collective memory, as well as the artist's metaphorical return to his native land. His fascination with the primitive is also reflected in much of his graphic work, as well as an archeology of natural life in the transfer of forms of animals and plants that resemble fossils made of metal, ceramic, or paper, which reinforce the idea of permanence of culture beyond life and point to the intense trace of the ancestral and the recovery of the past. His work is held by numerous public and private collections, including the Art Institute of Chicago, Biblioth√®que nationale de France, Cincinnati Art Museum, Instituto Nacional de Bellas Artes y Literatura of Mexico, Museo de Bellas Artes and Museum of Contemporary Art in Caracas, New York Museum of Modern Art, Art Museum of the Americas in Washington, Allen Memorial Art Museum at Oberlin College in Ohio, and the National Museum of Visual Arts of Montevideo, the garden of which became home to his 1991 sculpture Barca de la crucifixi√≥n in 2005. ==References * Category:1944 births Category:20th-century engravers Category:20th-century Uruguayan painters Category:Male painters Category:20th- century Uruguayan sculptors Category:Male sculptors Category:21st-century engravers Category:21st-century painters Category:21st-century sculptors Category:Living people Category:People from Montevideo Category:Uruguayan expatriates in the United States Category:Uruguayan people of Italian descent Category:20th-century male artists ","title":"Rimer Cardillo"}]`),F={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:R},data(){return{visibleCount:3,poemsData:P}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{loadMore(){this.visibleCount+=3}}},B={class:"card-container"};function D(s,a,o,c,f,n){const u=p("PoemCard");return t(),i(h,null,[a[1]||(a[1]=e("section",null,[e("div",{class:"top-Banner"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title-Text"},"üéâLife Quotesü•≥")])])],-1)),e("section",null,[e("div",B,[(t(!0),i(h,null,y(n.visiblePoems,(r,m)=>(t(),w(u,{key:m,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),n.hasMorePoems?(t(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",onClick:a[0]||(a[0]=(...r)=>n.loadMore&&n.loadMore(...r))},"See more")):b("",!0)])],64)}const x=d(F,[["render",D]]),I=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"quotesmag/2.md","filePath":"quotesmag/2.md"}'),H={name:"quotesmag/2.md"},L=Object.assign(H,{setup(s){return(a,o)=>(t(),i("div",null,[v(x)]))}});export{I as __pageData,L as default};
