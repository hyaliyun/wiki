A knight of the Order of Malta and a judge by profession, Carvalho e Sampayo became notable as an amateur scientist who authored two important works on the subject of chromatics. == Biography == Carvalho e Sampayo was born in the Casa do Poço, a manor house in the city of Lamego, Portugal, to Diogo Lopes de Carvalho and Catarina Teresa de Vasconcelos, of a prominent gentry family. He graduated from the University of Coimbra where he studied Law, later, in 1783, serving as a judge in Viana do Castelo. He resigned from his post after a conflict with the administrative authorities of the nearby town of Vila do Conde. At age 35, he joined the Order of Malta, and it was around this time, during his stay in Malta, that he started working on colour problems and ended up writing two books on the subject in rapid succession: the first was published in 1787, under the title Tratado das Cores (\\"A Treatise on Colours\\"); the second, in 1788, was titled Dissertação sobre as Cores Primitivas (\\"A Dissertation on Primitive Colours\\"). Sampayo's 15 linear scales in Dissertação sobre as Cores Primitivas, 1788 Sampayo devised a system of six simple colours (white, black, yellow, red, blue, and green), which he called generic colours, and combined each colour with the other five colours in turn, each combination having three intermediate grades, resulting in four steps: this would generate 15 linear scales. Sampayo's system is the first fully coloured system of one-dimensional simple hue and tint/shade scales as well as a gray scale. Johann Wolfgang von Goethe was familiar with Carvalho e Sampayo's work: his seminal treatise Theory of Colours (published 1810) includes a general assessment of Sampayo's 1791 book Memória sobre a Formação Natural das Cores (\\"An Essay on the Natural Formation of Colours\\"). Starting in 1789, he moved to Madrid where he headed the Portuguese diplomatic representation there, first as chargé d'affaires, then as a minister plenipotentiary, and finally as ambassador extraordinary, returning definitely to Portugal in 1801. In Madrid, Carvalho e Sampayo made acquaintance with Wilhelm von Humboldt. ==References== Category:1750 births Category:1807 deaths Category:Color scientists Category:People from Lamego Category:Portuguese diplomats Category:Portuguese judges Category:University of Coimbra alumni ","title":"Diogo de Carvalho e Sampayo"},{"id":"60390799","text":"Piabuna is a genus of North American araneomorph spiders first described by R.

Strickler was born in the community of Massanutten, Virginia, in a portion of Shenandoah County which later became part of Page County. He was descended from the company of Mennonites who had moved to the region from Lancaster County, Pennsylvania by 1733. Evidence suggests that he was a Mennonite preacher and schoolteacher in addition to creating fraktur. His earliest surviving work, dated 1787, already reveals him to be an accomplished calligrapher with his own distinctive personal vocabulary of symbols, including inverted hearts with flowers at their tips, sawtooth patterns, and comma-shaped serifs. Nearly a dozen surviving pieces, dating from 1787 to 1815, are known, including two birth records; two writing exercises; three uncolored practice designs; two religious allegories; a third, secular writing exercise; and another small drawing. These last two bear motifs reminiscent of those found on a tall-case clock made by a neighbor and relative, Johannes Spitler. The nature of Strickler's training is unknown, but his work bears certain similarities to that by more prolific fraktur artists from Pennsylvania, such as Daniel Schumacher. He evinced great confidence in his own work, in 1794 writing: \\"the paper is my field and the pen is my plow. This is why I am so clever. The ink is my seed with which I write my name.\\" At his death Strickler was interred in the family cemetery on his property. Several works by, or attributed to, Strickler are held by the Abby Aldrich Rockefeller Folk Art Museum. Another piece is in the collection of the Winterthur Museum; one is also owned by the American Folk Art Museum. ==References== Category:1770 births Category:1842 deaths Category:American male painters Category:Fraktur artists Category:18th-century American painters Category:19th-century American painters Category:People from Page County, Virginia Category:Painters from Virginia Category:American Mennonites Category:American people of German descent ","title":"Jacob Strickler"},{"id":"60391110","text":"David Onri Anderson is a Tennessee-born painter, musician and curator of French/Algerian ancestry, who emerged from the Nashville arts community in the mid-1990s.

Little is recorded about Spitler's life, but he is known to have been born in the community of Massanutten, Virginia, in a portion of Shenandoah County which later became part of Page County. He worked from the 1790s until around 1810, by which point he had moved to Fairfield County, Ohio. His style is distinctive; historians have posited that its uniqueness was informed by the geographic and social isolation of the community in which he lived and worked. Many of his pieces were traditional, while others incorporated natural imagery in addition to abstract patterns. He used the same palette throughout his career, red, blue, white, and black. He initialed all of his work, and kept a list of his pieces, which shows that at the peak of his career he was creating nearly twenty-five works a year. The majority of pieces Spitler painted were blanket chests, many of yellow pine; whether or not he made them himself, or merely painted them, is unknown. Two tall clock cases have also been attributed to him. One of the latter bears the signature of Jacob Strickler, a neighbor and relative by marriage who was also a fraktur artist; it underlines the influence which fraktur drawings had on furniture design in the German American community. Two unsigned pieces dating to after Spitler's move to Ohio have been ascribed to him, but their date is unknown; it is not known if he continued his artistic career after moving. He died in Ohio. Several pieces by Spitler were included in an exhibition of Virginia folk art at Colonial Williamsburg in 1973, an event which led to the identification of a body of work by Donald R. Walters. Today the Abby Aldrich Rockefeller Folk Art Museum owns a chest painted by Spitler, as well as one of the clocks. Other chests are held by the Museum of the Shenandoah Valley, the Winterthur Museum, and the Museum of Early Southern Decorative Arts. The American Folk Art Museum owns two chests and the second clock, which was a gift from Ralph Esmerian. Another chest sold at auction in 2015 for $356,500. ==References== Category:1774 births Category:1837 deaths Category:American male painters Category:18th-century American painters Category:19th-century American painters Category:People from Page County, Virginia Category:Painters from Virginia ","title":"Johannes Spitler"},{"id":"60391273","text":"Fuchibotulus is a genus of South African and Mozambican araneomorph spiders in the family Trachelidae, first described by C.

Timlin was a pioneer in the field of economics and is best known for her work and interpretation of Keynesian Theory, as well as Canadian immigration policy and post WWII monetary stabilization policy. In addition to her successful research career, Timlin was the first woman to serve as Vice President from 1953-1955 and President from 1959-1960 of the Canadian Political Science Association. She was also one of the first women and one of the very few Canadian economists to serve on the Executive Committee of the American Economic Association. == Early life and education == Born in the state of Wisconsin, Timlin grew up in a small town and moved to Saskatchewan upon graduating high school, where she worked as a teacher until she was hired as a secretary at the University of Saskatchewan in 1921. It was there that she obtained an English degree after feeling disappointed by the courses offered by the Economics Department and concluded that she would be better off to teach herself, all while working as a full-time secretary. Timlin then obtained her Ph.D. in economics at the University of Washington in 1940, and shortly thereafter published her dissertation \\"Keynesian Economics: A Synthesis\\" in 1942. Her university teaching career began as an assistant professor in 1941, followed by the appointment to associate professor in 1946, and then full professor in 1950 at the University of Saskatchewan. == Research == Timlin’s research greatly contributed to the fields of economic theory and immigration policy within Canada. The reception of Timlin’s contribution to Keynesian economics helped to form the unique characteristics of the Canadian economic system. Her work on Canadian immigration and monetary stabilization policies provided important implications for Canadian economic development and policy. === Keynesian economics === Mabel Timlin was responsible for introducing Keynesian economics to Canada. A key area of Timlin’s research surrounded The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money presented by John Maynard Keynes. Upon completion of her dissertation in 1940, the University of Toronto Press published her work under the title \\"Keynesian Economics\\" in 1942. Timlin approached Keynes’s General Theory within a general equilibrium framework. The long-term interest rate presented in Keynes’s model is replaced by an analysis of the overall composition of interest rates and how it fits into the system’s equilibrium. Timlin proposed three main models in her work: a static Fundamental Model and two Supplementary Models. The Fundamental Model predicted that planned savings and investment would remain the same, however from one week to another, changes in income are attributed to the relative interest rate and the marginal propensity to consume. The two Supplementary Models are essentially reversible, where in one Model the contracts for the services of factors of production are completed on Monday and on Tuesday the sales contracts are made. The sequence is reversed in the second Supplementary Model. Timlin focused on the unstable equilibrium of a Keynesian system and highlighted the conditions in Week Two are a result of the equilibrium of Week One thus shifting its position. Timlin concluded with five main implications of her research on the Keynesian system. First, the structure of the interest rate complex is equally or even more important as the average level of interest rates to maintaining the employment level equilibrium. Second, economic activity can be hindered by both high and low interest rate levels. Third, human psychology and its unstable nature will limit the chance of reaching a stable equilibrium; high unemployment levels and low levels of interest could persist at the same time and indefinitely. Fourth, the movement of money between active and inactive balances creates business cycles, even though the amount of money is given. Lastly, unemployment is likely to be persistent in a monetary economy. Timlin’s work had significant policy implications within Canada. She highlighted the importance of economic theory in creating policy, and deduced Keynesian economics to the Liberal Party of Canada. === Monetary policy === After her extensive work on Keynesian economics, Timlin devoted the rest of her research career to monetary and immigration policy within Canada. Her research on Canadian monetary policy surrounded the post World War II era, where she critiqued the Bank of Canada’s failure to employ Keynesian countercyclical stabilization policies during the inflation period of the Korean War. Her paper titled \\"Recent Developments in Canadian Monetary Policy\\" indicated that expansionist policies undertaken by the Bank of Canada would have been more reasonable had the effects of increasing external prices and outputs on bank deposits and reserves been delayed until the inflation had resolved itself. Similarly, in Timlin’s paper Monetary Stabilization Policies and Keynesian Theory, she indicates that following WWII, the rate of investment should have been limited through increased yield flexibility on the securities flowing into the central banks’ portfolios. === Immigration policy === Timlin published three main papers on Canadian immigration: \\"Economic Theory and Immigration Policy\\" (published in the Canadian Journal of Economics and Political Science), \\"Does Canada Need More People?\\" (published in Oxford University Press) and \\"Canada's Immigration Policy, 1896-1920\\" (published in CJEPS). In \\"Economic Theory and Immigration Policy\\" she conveyed that economic theory can only get policymakers so far in formulating immigration policy and examining the direct effects of migration; quantitative analysis is required to identify patterns and deduce proper results. In her second paper, \\"Does Canada Need More People?\\", Timlin examines both the effects of external and internal conditions on Canada’s ability to admit immigrants. Timlin studied the short and long run absorptive capacity of Canada and argued that the extent to which the effects of a growing population will be felt will depend on Canada’s external economic relationships with the rest of the world. She concluded the paper by emphasizing the importance of all nations selecting immigration policies that improve resource allocation for the whole world; a system of free migration with large-scale international trade is essential for economic development and maximizing efficiency within economies. Timlin’s third paper on immigration policy, Canada’s Immigration policy, 1896-1920, examined the transition to the 1910 Immigration Act with particular interest on the attitudes expressed by the Minister of the Interior, Clifford Sifton, and Sir Wilfrid Laurier. Sifton believed that only agricultural immigrants were beneficial to the economy, and subsequently disapproved of Asian immigrants who did not settle on farmlands. Timlin addressed the racial tensions associated with immigration in this paper, and claimed that the prejudices were uncalled for, transmuting a labour question into a racial question. == Honours and awards == * 1945-1956 Guggenheim Fellowship * 1951 elected to the Royal Society of Canada * 1959-1960 Canada Council Special Senior Fellowship * 1967 Canada's Centennial Medal * 1969 named an Honorary Degree of Doctor of Laws by the University of Saskatchewan * 1976 named to the Order of Canada == Positions held == * 1941-1943 Member, Canadian Political Science Association * 1950-1951 Consultant, Federal Commission on Prices * 1952 Consultant, Royal Commission for the Saskatchewan River Development * 1953-1955 Vice President, Canadian Political Science Association * 1957-1960 Member, Executive Committee, American Economics Association * 1959-1960 President, Canadian Political Science Association == Selected works == * Timlin, Mabel.

She is part of the artist/art curation duo, Dos Mestizx, along with artist Michael Menchaca. Since 2017, González has been an adjunct professor at Our Lady of the Lake University in San Antonio, Texas. == Early life and education == González was born in 1989 in Austin, Texas and raised in Houston. González was raised Catholic, which she said had later informed her artwork in terms of recognizing the patriarchal role of religion and government. She has identified as Xicana, Queer, and vegan. She attended Texas State University in San Marcos, Texas and earned a BFA degree in Studio Art in 2012. While attending college she co-founded the zine, Yes Ma’am. In 2015, González graduated with a MFA degree in Painting from the Rhode Island School of Design (RISD). == Artwork == ===Tasty Chick (2013) === Created in 2013 and placed in a solo exhibit in San Antonio, Texas in the Lady Base Gallery the same year. This piece is an acrylic and collage on canvas which González states was influenced by advertising images covered by Carol Adams. The piece contains the silhouette of a chicken with a collage of images that make up a two-piece bikini on the chicken. These images include multiple advertisements where a chicken is in a provocative or sexually suggestive pose. González attached actual advertising images in order to recognize the \\"sexualization of animals and meat\\" and focuses on the \\"consumption of birds and women\\". ===Miss Drumstick (2013) === This was created in 2013 and was later placed in a solo exhibit at the R Gallery in San Antonio that same year. In 2014, it was placed with the Young Latina Artists: Y Qué? Group Exhibit Mexic-Arte Museum in Austin. In this artwork, there are 6 legs. Some of them are made of wood while others are made of plastic. Above the legs hang two paintings of turkeys. The influence for this piece was taken from an image that González found in The Pornography of Meat by Carol Adams. In this, over 20 pairs of female legs are underneath a sign with a turkey body. Above the sign are the words \\"MISS DRUMSTICKS 1953\\". The content came from a pageant held in Yellville, Arkansas. This is a part of the Turkey Trot celebration where the women are judged only by their legs just as animals that are only judged by the meat on their bones. With this work, González wanted to \\"create something that would undermine the pageant's implications of the sexualization of women's legs compared to that of turkeys\\". She also decided to go with secondary colors with respect to the way women are treated as the second gender in this world. The legs in this piece are meant by González to demonstrate how women have their bodies dismembered in advertising in order to enhance the effectiveness of that ad. This \\"relates to the actual chopping of animals into meat products\\". She feels that the mannequin-like legs are important, as she states that they are much like advertising, they are used to sell what should be considered appropriate boy types and clothing styles. Also, González has \\"covered each leg in different amounts of hair to display the wide range of how women treat their legs and bodies\\" and the legs are about the acceptance and the difference among bodies. ===Assault (2013) === This was created in 2013 and was placed in the Pale Firework Group Exhibit at the RISD Gelman Gallery in Providence, Rhode Island and the New Talent RISD MFA Painting Group Exhibit at the New York Design Center in New York, both in 2014. This piece was created by using oil on a cut out panel and was inspired by a skinny cow advertisement that González thought that it was \\"nonsensical\\" as it contained a sexualized cow promoting her milk for the consumption of humans. This was painted like a traditional sign painting in order to keep the theme of advertising. According to Kathryn Eddy, it also suggests that her milk has made her skinny as well. She also notes that González replaces the cow's head with a violent object (a saw) in order to explain how one's identity is removed when they are seen as an object. ===Universal Constructs (2013) === Created in 2013, here González has created a diptych piece where one of the paintings is done with menstrual blood on paper and the other is with water color on paper. Universal Constructs depicts a range of social binaries such as the \\"dichotomies of culture/nature, man/woman, human/animal, oppressor/oppressed, and so on\\". Eddy states that the menstrual blood in this painting brings up the violence that happens against animals while connecting this to violence against women. Both paintings used to be the same shade of red, but the menstrual blood gets browner with time. ===What Are the Conditions That Led Us to This? (2015) === This collection of pieces was made through oil painting, spray paint, and digital printouts for Suzy González's MFA thesis in 2015 at Rhode Island School of Design. González has stated that the collection attempts to create a \\"Utopian space\\". In doing so, it also reflects on The Last Supper which shows patriarchal values. As a response to this, she uses a collection of female characters that each have their own background. Still, they are connected to one another. One of the figures in this piece has been described by the artist as \\"The Acrimboldo-esque figure made up of fruits and vegetables [that's] representative of my own personal consumptions\\". There is also the figure with a broken wrist and leg which is made of tiles. This is a portrait of Ana Mendieta. Thirdly, there is a life-size doll made from corn husk. This is meant to \\"reflect on [González's] childhood, Native American cultures, and the exploitation of corn\\". Each figure in this work \\"acts as a piece of [González], or someone with whom [she] identif[ies]\\". By placing them with each other, they are meant to communicate as a group. Equally important, all of these characters have \\"ties to Latin@ cultures and speak of the reality of their struggles rather than their glorification\\". The struggles embedded within this piece are abortion rights, domestic violence, decolonization, the complex nature of gender, objectification, cultural appropriation, and stereotypes\\". ===Lolita Devoured (2017) === Since 2017, this has been held at The Sexual Politics of Meat Group Exhibit at The Animal Museum in Los Angeles, California. This piece can be described as triptych with oil on canvas. It's meant to \\"separate visual consumption, gustatory consumption, and the consumed individual\\". The heart glasses on the cow symbolize innocence and the development of sexuality. Also, González uses anatomical diagrams to compare our similar \\"make-ups\\". González reflects on what women are to sex as animals are to meat. Both women and animals are meant to be consumed with respect to sex and meat. With this, González has created something that \\"observes the gaze of the consumer and the distress if the consumed being\\". == Collections == Suzy González's work is featured in various public art collections including the University of Notre Dame's Institute for Latino Studies, Texas State University, Rhode Island School of Design Museum, and at the Mexic-Arte Museum, among others. == References == == External links == * * Interview with Newfound * Interview with Third Woman Press Category:People from Austin, Texas Category:Texas State University alumni Category:Rhode Island School of Design alumni Category:Living people Category:Activists from Texas Category:Veganism activists Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:American artists of Mexican descent Category:1989 births Category:Artists from San Antonio ","title":"Suzy González"},{"id":"60391561","text":"Robert Cannell (born August 12, 1942) is a pediatrician who was a member of the Arizona State Senate and the Arizona House of Representatives.

He is the co-owner of Boston Urban Hospitality, a restaurant group based in Boston, Massachusetts. == Early life and education == Coombs grew up in Peabody, Massachusetts. His mother was a preschool teacher and his father worked in a factory as a millwright. Coombs' first job in the culinary industry was at age 11, washing dishes for a local seafood restaurant. He enrolled in The Culinary Institute of America (CIA), where he studied culinary arts from 2002 to 2004. == Career == In 2003, Coombs began working under Ming Tsai at Blue Ginger in Wellesley, Massachusetts. Upon graduating, he headed to Nantucket Island in Massachusetts to work for a Relais & Chateau Property, Toppers at the Wauwinet. There he met chef and restaurateur Patrick O’Connell, who was impressed by Coombs and hired him after a 3-day try out. Coombs moved to Washington, Virginia to work at O’Connell's luxury inn and restaurant, The Inn at Little Washington. He remained at The Inn through 2005, cooking for Laura Bush, The White House, and Le Club des Chefs de Chef, among others. Coombs returned to Boston in late 2005. He cooked for a short time at Aujourd’hui at the Four Seasons Boston, before settling at Troquet, where he worked for about nine months. While at Troquet, Coombs met Brian Piccini, owner of dbar in Dorchester, Massachusetts. Piccini wanted to elevate dbar's dinner service, and allowed Coombs to experiment with the menu on Sunday nights. These Sunday dinners became increasingly popular in the community. In August 2006, Piccini brought Coombs on as executive chef, where Coombs revamped dbar's menu to focus on local ingredients, seasonality, and sustainability. Within a few months of Coombs arrival, dbar was given a 3-star review by the Boston Herald. Coombs planted a large garden on dbar's roof that still supplies the restaurant with fresh produce throughout the year. In 2010, Coombs opened Deuxave in Boston. Subsequently, he had two appearances on Food Network’s Chopped. Deuxave received a 3-star review from the Boston Globe in 2010 and AAA 4-Diamond recognition in 2014. The restaurant has been named “Best French Restaurant” by Boston magazine multiple times since opening. Deuxave received four stars from Forbes Travel Guide in 2017, one of three restaurants in Boston to currently carry that rating, and has retained that honor ever since. In 2013, Coombs opened his third restaurant concept with Piccini, Boston Chops, in Boston's South End. The steakhouse champions nose-to-tail dining, where offal is prominently featured throughout the menu, along with traditional steak cuts. Boston Chops’ signature bone-in ribeye was featured on the cover of Food & Wine. The restaurant has garnered several awards, including Food & Wine’s “Best New Steak Houses”, and \\"Best Steakhouse 2015\\" from Boston magazine's Best of Boston awards. Coombs was named Forbes magazine's 30 Under 30 in food and wine in 2013. That same year, Coombs was named in Zagat’s 30 Under 30 list. The Massachusetts Restaurant Association then named him Restaurateur of the Year in 2015. In the fall of 2015, Coombs competed in the Forbes 30 Under 30 cooking competition and won the People’s Choice award. Coombs has represented Deuxave at the James Beard House on several occasions, creating themed dinners for their guests. He has been a HP Hood Cream spokesperson since 2013 and wrote an e-cookbook for HP Hood Cream titled Chef Creations Inspired by Hood® Cream In May 2018, Coombs opened a second installation of Boston Chops in the Downtown Crossing area of Boston. The restaurant expanded its predecessor’s private dining capabilities and added a lunch service five days a week. The opening garnered national attention largely due to its “Instagram Table”, a singular table in the restaurant's dining room with a secondary lighting system to enable quality photography of the meal for diners’ social media platforms. The table is only reserved via Instagram direct messaging, but is available to any guest. Boston Chops Downtown was named in “The Most Beautiful New Restaurants of 2018” by Eater and in “The 18 Best Restaurants in Boston” by Conde Nast Traveler. Coombs and Piccini own Boston Urban Hospitality (BUH), the restaurant group encompassing their four restaurants. As of 2018, BUH also serves as a management company. BUH's executive chef Adrienne Wright, Coombs's creative partner and mentee, was a finalist on Bravo’s Top Chef in its sixteenth season. Coombs appeared on an episode of the season, serving as Wright's mentor. He also appeared in advertisements for Mercedes-Benz. He is the Co-Chair of the Forbes 30 Under 30 Food Festival and helped bring the festival to Boston annually. Coombs has appeared in food festivals internationally, including the South Beach Wine and Food Fest, and the New York City Wine and Food Fest. == Personal Life == Coombs has become somewhat of a fitness influencer, and credits his diet and exercise with helping him manage his ADHD. He advocates for this approach rather than utilizing additional medications. == Current Restaurants == * dbar * Deuxave * Boston Chops South End * Boston Chops Downtown == References == == External links == * Category:1984 births Category:Living people Category:Businesspeople from Boston Category:American chefs Category:Culinary Institute of America alumni Category:People from Peabody, Massachusetts ","title":"Chris Coombs"},{"id":"60391597","text":"Scopelobates is a genus of tarantulas containing the single species, Scopelobates sericeus.

It was in middle school after meeting with her counselor, Ms. Barrios, where she first heard someone of Mexican Descent call themselves Chicana. After the conversation with her counselor, Aguayo realized that she also identified as Chicana. After researching Chicana Artists, she realized that there weren't a lot of artists. So she decided that she would create her own artwork. Aguayo began painting at the age of 14, depicting all the many shades of brown on her canvas. In her 20s she worked a full-time job but felt trapped. She then decided to quit her job and start working part-time to work on her art. After a lot of insisting she was allowed to restore a temporary mural at Chicano Park in San Diego. With the restoration of the mural she was given the title of muralist. She has continued to paint at Chicano Park and work on community public art projects with people of different culture. She is now a part of the Chicano Park Steering Committee. == Artworks == === Three Wise Men === An Acrylic painting done in 2019.

In 2016, Prószyński erected a new genus, Logunyllus, for some species of Yllenus. Logunyllus was declared a junior synonym of Pseudomogrus in 2019. Under the synonym Logunyllus, Prószyński placed the genus in his informal group \\"yllenines\\", with Yllenus as a representative genus.

Her first contact with video was when she filmed Super 8. Her artworks display the evolution of video and express themes of intimacy, marginalization, and different perceptions. She studied cinematography at the National Autonomous University of Mexico film school in Mexico City. Minter's career began in the 1970s when she joined the experimental group Ergónico. While she was a part of this group, she was able to have her first contact with video and developed a strong liking for it. The medium was affordable and unrestricted in terms of structure, which is something that she enjoyed. Minter used this to her advantage, creating works that express her own ideas and thoughts despite the male dominance of the genre and the rejection that the genre received. In the late 1990s, Minter worked as a teacher, curator, and promoter of video. She was one of the founders of the video workshop at the Escuela Nacional de Pintura, Escultura y Grabado \\"La Esmeralda\\" in Mexico City and worked as a professor there. She also taught video at Casa del Lago and at the Universidad Iberoamericana. In 2002, she spoke about the lack of recognition that Mexican video received.

Minter asked the participants to talk about love and intimacy and the issues that may arise from it from a personal perspective. The idea is to show how love is expressed in a specific community. The participants were people who were close to Minter, and most of them were involved in arts and humanities. There was no restrictions in terms of gender or race. When displayed, viewers are only able to hear the conversations if they are close to the installation, further allowing for a more intimate experience. === Nadie es inocente (No one is innocent, 1985–87) === This film shows tells a story of a group of young people living in a punk experience. It shows how these people expressed their punk lifestyles, intending to shine light on the marginalized state that they live in. The film crushes stereotypes that are inflicted upon those who identify as punk and shows viewers the lives of these people from a personal perspective. Minter came in contact with the individuals 20 years later and a made a film (Nadie es inocente- 20 años después) that shows the lives of these individuals and the careers they were able to pursue, further showing that punk individuals are capable of pursuing more than society says. === Alma punk (Punk soul, 1992) === This film is a narrative about a girl named Alma who lives in Mexico City. She comes into contact with punk, Mexican rock, and the ideals of living abroad. It displays the ideas of punk, rebellion, economic instability, and weak political regime. It also displays the perspective of a teenager trying to express herself. === Intervalos (Intervals, 2004) === This piece is made up of 18 video installations that show scenes of intimacy between other people and including herself. It expresses bodily sensations and urban observations. This work allowed Minter to express herself and show herself in different perspectives. Every scene shows who she is and what she sees, although she is not physically present in all of them. == Exhibitions == * 1990 Mexican Video, Bronx Museum of the Arts, New York * 1994 Third Bienal de Video, Mexico City * 1997 Femme totale: Sixth International Women's Film Festival, Dortmund, Germany * 1997 Mexican Video: Thorn of the Mountain, Museum of Modern Art, New York * 1999 Vid@arte: Festival de video y artes electrónicas, Centro Nacional de las Artes, Mexico City * 2015 Eye in Rotation: Sarah Minter.

Nevertheless, the genus is accepted by the World Spider Catalog .

Known mainly for her acting work in film and television, Jurgens is also the cofounder of The Blood Projects, a Canadian theatre company through which she and cofounder Sasha Singer-Wilson have produced a number of uniquely immersive and highly regarded projects including Little Tongues, This Is It, and Inside. ==Early life and education== Sarah Jurgens was born in Epsom, England to South African-British parents Elizabeth Clare Jurgens and Paul Cloete Jurgens. Jurgens went to the theatre for the first time at the age of five: \\"I was hooked on the power of theatre the day my dad took me to see Cats on Broadway in London.\\" The family moved to Cape Town, South Africa, and later to Tumbler Ridge, a small coal-mining town in northern British Columbia when Sarah was still a child, later relocating to the Lower Mainland, on the coast, where the young Jurgens discovered acting in high school, performing in musicals. At age 18, Jurgens moved to Toronto to study at the Acting Conservatory at York University, graduating with a Bachelor of Fine Arts Honours. She chose acting as her \\"passion and profession\\": \\"It was the art form that I found most challenging and demanding in terms of self-exploration. As I grow as an individual, I also grow as an artist. It is an ever-evolving process and it's one that keeps me asking questions, and keeps me engaged with life.\\" The most challenging aspect of her training as an actor was maintaining perspective: \\"Sometimes it's easy to forget what's going on in the rest of the world when ... submerged in such an intensive training\\", which she values very highly: > Four years seems like a lot for intensive acting training, but I wouldn't > trade it for the world. Education is a powerful tool and my training is so > rock solid; so ingrained in me now. One of my favourite things at York was > our Clown Training. Clowning became an integral part of my process as an > actor. It developed an entirely new level of vulnerability for me, it taught > me the power of humor & tragedy and that they are often one entity. It > taught me how to improv! Under the guidance of Leah Cherniak, Jurgens formed one half of a clowning double act, \\"Rosie and Loulou\\"; the pair performed the act in Toronto on several occasions through at least 2011, eventually resulting in one of the earliest performances in a short film by Jurgens. The act was described by one critic as \\"character-driven, engaging on an emotional level, sometimes holding-a-mirror-up\\". In her graduation year (2009), Jurgens co-founded The Blood Projects theatrical production company with her friend and fellow alumna Sasha Singer-Wilson after the unions affiliated with the university went on strike, which led to the cancelling of many classes and shows: \\"It completely altered our final year ... We really felt the loss of that creative time, so we decided we were going to create our own work.\\" After graduating, Jurgens spent time in London, England, doing theatre workshops before returning to Toronto, where she continued to study with David Rotenberg at the Professional Actors Lab and Michèle Lonsdale Smith. ==Career== ===Overview=== Most of the work Sarah Jurgens has done since graduation has been in film and television, including commercial work. In September 2015, asked how she decides on serious roles or projects, Jurgens said she chooses roles based on challenge: > If any sort of fear bubbles up when I encounter the script, I know it's > because the material is resonating with me, and whatever the character > represents is a chance to explore that aspect of myself. I also get really > inspired when the creative team is composed of artists who are equally > passionate about telling the same story, and taking risks with it. In December of the same year, she said: \\"I would like to play strong female characters with agency, who aren't minimized by patriarchal ideas but rather deeply human… I would like to work in film and theatre that isn't afraid to engage audience members and ask pressing questions about the nature of our humanity.\\" Spending time in several different countries in her youth prompted a fascination with accents and dialects: > Because I grew up with the good fortune of traveling to different areas of > the world where my extended family resides, I developed a keen ear for > accents. I really enjoy dialect work, it often opens up an entirely new > inner-landscape for me to draw on as an actor, and it brings an edge to the > character that I otherwise may not have found. Jurgens is able to \\"tap in\\" and become a wide range of characters with starkly different backgrounds. Director Jonathan Bensimon has called her \\"a gifted, versatile, and bold actress\\" and described her performances as \\"raw, honest and fearless\\". She has been able to transition between heavy drama, comedy and horror projects \\"with astonishing ease.\\" ===Motion pictures=== ====Feature films==== Michael DeCarlo's Two Hands to Mouth (2012) is a dark, comedic, politically-driven feature film where eight blindfolded guests assemble at a secret pop-up restaurant. The film was nominated for two awards at the 2013 Madrid International Film Festival. Jurgens played Anya, the Russian wife of a businessman named Frank (Joe Pingue): \\"Working with a Russian dialect opened up a very specific emotional range for me. It was incredibly fun to play a woman so secure in her sexuality and power.\\" She went on to say it was an \\"invaluable learning experience\\" working with veterans like Kate Trotter, Ernie Grunwald, and Vincent Walsh. Swearnet: The Movie (2014) is a comedy made by the team behind Trailer Park Boys, plus Tom Green, Carrot Top, and Sarah Jurgens, who plays Julie, the girlfriend of Rob Wells, \\"driven mad by jealousy with an obsession over an ex-punk rock star\\". Jurgens credits her training in clowning at York University for getting her the part: \\"When I was going through the callback process for Swearnet, I found I relied deeply on the fundamentals of clowning and it allowed me to improv in the audition room effortlessly.\\" Filming Swearnet was the most fun she had ever had on a set: Wells, Mike Smith, John Paul Tremblay and Tom Green were constantly improvising.\\"The director, Warren P. Sonoda, created a working environment that was fast-paced and creatively freeing. We were often encouraged to stretch the boundaries of the characters ... and the improv elements kept me on my toes.\\" In The Man in the Shadows (2015), Jurgens played Rachel, a photographer addicted to prescription drugs who starts to lose her sense of reality as she grapples with her broken marriage and her nightmares, which turn out to be real. She said it gave her \\"permission\\" to explore the experience of being haunted, hunted and stalked\\", an \\"opportunity to live in a state of mental unraveling\\": \\"I enjoyed the challenge of playing a character who was wrestling with truth and illusion, experiencing the slippage of her own sanity.\\" Jurgens found the most challenging thing was \\"arcing\\" the character's descent into delusion. The film opened at the Dances with Films Festival in Los Angeles, then at Cinéfest Sudbury and Scare-A-Con where it was nominated for Best Feature and Best Actress. Jurgens has a supporting role in Georgetown, a film by Chistopher Waltz which premiered on 27 April 2019. ====Short films==== In 2010, Jurgens took her clowning double act and a camera crew to Toronto's Financial District. Rosie & Loulou: Quest for Love (2011) is a short docufiction film directed by Elli Weisbaum which follows the pair as they talk about love and offer roses to passersby. In December 2015, Jurgens finished filming her scenes as the star of County Time, a short film directed by Jonathan Bensimon (who directed her in Let Go of the Future) and written by Josh Peace based on his experiences living in Huron County, Ontario, a small farming community filled with \\"larger than life characters\\" and tall tales. Jurgens \\"loved the erratic behaviour\\" of her character, who she described as \\"feisty, determined, easily irritated, and no-bullshit.\\" The film had its premiere at Palm Springs International ShortFest, the largest film festival for short films in the US, on 23 June 2017. Jurgens worked with Swansea-based Canadian director Teryl Brouillette on a pair of short narrative films, Work (2016), a docudrama, and A Bridge and a Door. Jurgens was the casting director for Bite and Smile, a 2018 short satirical film by Elise Baumane. ===Television and web series=== Jurgens' first television role was Gaia, a guest part on Lost Girl in 2011, followed by another guest role as Karina Vost on Covert Affairs in 2012. In 2013, she appeared on Republic of Doyle and Beauty & the Beast. Around this time she also appeared in the web series Backpackers, later picked up as a television series by The CW in 2014. In 2015, Jurgens had the starring role of Lucy Huff in the pilot for director Matthew Kowalchuk's comedy miniseries Green-ish, in which her character, a recent divorcee, forms an environmental activist group in an attempt to win the local mayoral race and remove her conservative ex-husband, the current mayor, from office. In 2017, Jurgens portrayed recurring character Shawna in the third season of iZombie. ===Videos, modeling, and voice acting=== In 2013, Jurgens starred in the Dove and Gun music video Let Go of the Future, which premiered at the Cannes Film Festival. The video showcased her ability \\"to communicate a character's story and exude deep, soulful emotion without ever having to say a word.\\" In 2014, Jurgens was one of three women chosen as models accompanying photographer Scarlet O'Neill on a road trip from Toronto to Nashville, doing shoots along the way while filmmaker Ana Alic shot an artistic video of the women posing during the trip, Girls Gone Nashville. Jurgensis known to have appeared in five commercial videos and has done modeling work since at least 2010. Jurgens provided one of the additional voices in the 2015 video game Assassin's Creed Syndicate. ===Toronto stage=== ====The Blood Projects==== The Blood Projects differs from other companies in that the focus is on original works. The staging of these works also sets them apart, as the company specializes in immersive theatre, the audience members free to move from room to room, to choose where to view one of several simultaneously occurring scenes. Productions take place in site-specific areas, the company dedicated to creating immersive performances in \\"unlikely places\\" and \\"re-imagining more traditional spaces; uniting emerging and established artists and managing the company and production of our work with ecological awareness and integrity.\\" The name of the company is derived from the founders' interest in \\"the connective tissue of stories\\"; they were interested in work \\"connected to family, to questions about life and death, and the intricacies of the human experience\\", and they liked the idea of \\"projects\\" because they were both multi-disciplinary artists. The company produced Singer-Wilson's first full-length play, Little Tongues, in a 35-seat downtown Toronto loft: \\"When scenes happened in the kitchen ... the actors were really preparing food and the audience could smell the dinner being made. It engaged with the audience on an intimate, sensory level.\\" Jurgens played Tessa, the jaded daughter of a broken family. The production received extraordinary reviews from several outlets including Mooney on Theatre and Now Toronto as a Critics' Pick at the 2012 Toronto Fringe Festival. The company also produced Singer-Wilson's Brief Sketches (2014). Jurgens acted in both this and Singer-Wilson's third play, This Is It, staged entirely in bed, in which Jurgens dazzled audiences in the leading role of Eve. Inside (2016), a co-production with Cat and the Queen as part of the SummerWorks Performance Festival, explored the public presentation and private experience of self, the crew staging three shows per night, only allowing five audience members inside for each show, audience members only given the location of the apartment where the performance was staged the evening before the show. ====Other productions==== Jurgens has starred in an impressive list of high-profile theatrical productions including The Bewitched, The Clown Show, The Penelopiad and Reasons to be Pretty. Nigel Shawn Williams's production of Peter Barnes' The Bewitched, one of her favourites, is set in 17th century Spain before the War of Spanish Succession, a story of the last of the Habsburg dynasty, \\"a family of rulers so inbred that their diseases prevent them from producing an heir to the throne\\", in which she played Queen Anna: \\"It was an incredible experience playing a historical figure. Maria Anna of Neuburg was Queen of Spain from 1689 to 1700 as the second wife of King Charles II. It allowed me to explore her explosive anger, resulting in seizures and phantom pregnancies.\\" A later favourite stage role was in a Nightwood Theatre Director's Summit Workshop, a short but \\"most profound\\" theatrical experience, in which a group of actresses were gathered together for a workshop where a team of female directors were guided by world-renowned director and playwright Yael Farber. They explored Margaret Atwood's play, The Penelopiad, Atwood's \\"daring response\\" to Homer's Odyssey: \\"It was empowering to work with an inspiring collective of female artists, because everyone in the room was willing to take risks under the leadership and artistic genius of Yael Farber. I would love to work with her again in the future.\\" ===Multimedia artist=== On 8 December 2015, Jurgens launched This Body Project, a multimedia art event which took place at Artscape Youngplace described as seven years in the making. Jurgens sought to \\"discover and transform the relationship between self and body\\" through \\"photography, audio recordings and the written word,\\" posing the question, \\"What is your relationship with your body?\\" and inviting the individual to become the author of their own story. Jurgens said she was interested in \\"art that holds space for truth through testimony and witness.\\" > As a young woman, navigating my way through my 20s left me asking questions > that I was desperate to discuss in a communal context. Examining the > relationship between body and self is a life-long journey that deserves its > own sacred space. ==Filmography== ===Motion pictures=== ;Feature films *Two Hands to Mouth (2012) • Anya *Swearnet: The Movie (2014) • Julie *The Man in the Shadows (2015) • Rachel Darwin *Georgetown (2019) ;Short films *Rosie & LouLou: Quest for Love (2011) • (clown persona \\"LouLou\\", uncredited) *A Bridge and a Door (2015?) *Work (2016) • The Actor *County Time (2017) • Tammy *Bite and Smile (2018) (casting director) *Boundless (2020) ===Television and web series=== *Lost Girl: \\"Something Wicked This Fae Comes\\" (2011) • Gaia *Covert Affairs: \\"Wishful Beginnings\\" (2012) • Karina Vost *Beauty & the Beast: \\"Playing with Fire\\" (2013) • Blonde Woman *Republic of Doyle: \\"From Dublin with Love\\" (2013) • Kara Fisher *Backpackers (2014) *Green-ish: \\"Burnaby Mountain\\" (2015) • Lucy Huff *iZombie: \\"Conspiracy Weary\\", \\"Return of the Dead Guy\\", \\"Twenty-Sided, Die\\" (2017) • Shawna ===Videos and voice acting=== *Let Go of the Future (2013) • Woman *Girls Gone Nashville (2014) • Herself (model) *Assassin's Creed Syndicate (2015) • (video game; voice) ==Note== ==References== ==External links== *Sarah Jurgens on IMDb (as \\"Lou Jurgens\\") Category:Canadian film actresses Category:Canadian television actresses Category:Living people Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Sarah Jurgens"},{"id":"60391788","text":"Qiongocera is a genus of Southeast Asian araneomorph spiders in the family Psilodercidae, containing the single species, Qiongocera hongjunensis.

He was the first artist to use fraktur as a method of general record-keeping, rather than a document of important events. Schumacher was born in Hamburg; his name is found on a ship's manifest from Halifax, Nova Scotia, in 1751, at which time his profession is given as \\"candidate of theology\\". His education was poor, and he had no ministerial qualifications; even so, Lutheran congregations in Pennsylvania needed a pastor, and he was able to make a living at the profession. He was active during his career in Berks, Lehigh, and Northampton Counties. Schumacher kept records of various pastoral acts, decorating them with images of flowers and angels; from 1754 until 1773 he kept a similar book of his own, noting each child he baptized or confirmed. Other motifs to appear in his work include the eye of God and hearts. He attempted to depict Lutheran doctrine in six drawings; he drew New Year greetings to friends, and produced other drawings as well. Some of his frakturs contain poems of his own composition. Schumacher married and had a family, and owned a farm of one hundred acres. He died in Weisenberg Township, Lehigh County, Pennsylvania. Schumacher was a controversial figure during his life, being accused of drunkenness on numerous occasions, and leaving his first wife soon after their wedding. He eventually ran afoul of his superior, Henry Muhlenberg, who ultimately dismissed him from his post as a pastor; he did, however, have supporters elsewhere in the Lutheran community, and was able to find another position. Surviving pieces by Schumacher may be found in the collections of the New-York Historical Society, the Winterthur Museum, and the Monroe County Historical Association in Stroudsburg, Pennsylvania. ==References== Category:Year of birth uncertain Category:1720s births Category:1787 deaths Category:German emigrants to the Thirteen Colonies Category:Artists from Hamburg Category:American Lutheran clergy Category:People from Lehigh County, Pennsylvania Category:American male painters Category:18th-century American painters Category:18th-century Lutheran clergy Category:Religious leaders from Pennsylvania Category:Fraktur artists ","title":"Daniel Schumacher"},{"id":"60391982","text":"Frances Woolley is a professor of economics at Carleton University, Canada and has been teaching there since 1990.

The paper simulates a 2-person family in which individuals are utility-maximizing yet interdependent due to social and economic causes. The Cournot-Nash game is used in the paper to first reach the equilibrium as an approach to solve the utility-maximizing problem, and then used as a \\"threat point in a bargaining game\\". Overall, the paper examines the issues within the households related to resource allocation, bargaining power, as well as under the influence of public policy. ==== “Ending Universality: The Case of Child Benefits” Canadian Public Policy, 22(1): 24-39, 1996.

The paper explores the effect of 1993 child tax benefit as well as the tax and benefit system, evaluating who are the beneficiaries of the benefits. The paper argues that the greatest net beneficiaries of were lower-middle income families instead of the poorest family due to the tax system. It also argues that earned income supplement would in general lead to an increase in marginal tax rate in Canada due to tax back provision. ==== “Taxing Canadian Families: What’s Fair, What’s Not” Choices vol 6(5) July 2000 with Carole Vincent ==== Frances Woolley won the Outstanding Research Contribution Award, Canadian Policy Research Awards in 2000 as well as the Doug Purvis Memorial Prize due to her work that she created with Carole Vincent.

That same year, he married Anna Rorup. The following year, he took the engraver, Heinrich Aldegrever, then only nineteen years old, into his studio as a partner. Sometime before 1530, he became a member of the Painters' Guild. He left the city in 1533, during the Münster rebellion by the Anabaptists, and returned after order had been restored. Much of his work immediately following his return involved restoring the works damaged or destroyed during the rebellion. In addition to murals and decorative works, he was widely respected as a portrait painter. He also worked for the printer and typographer, Dietrich Tzwyvel and may have helped decorate the astronomical clock that Tzwyvel designed for the Cathedral. He and Anna had eight children altogether; including three who became painters: Hermann tom Ring, Ludger tom Ring the Younger and Herbert tom Ring (1530 - 1593). He and his wife both died during an epidemic of the plague on Palm Sunday in 1547. == Works == One of his largest projects involved a tableau of fifteen sibyls and prophets who foretold the coming of Christ. They were originally displayed in Münster Cathedral. Six have survived. Five are in museums in Münster. The Delphic Sibyl is in the Louvre. Many experts suggest that these were actually copies made by Ring after the original series by Robert Campin (from 1435) had been damaged or destroyed by the Anabaptists.

Young was elected to the Baltimore City Council in 1996 representing Baltimore's second district. In 2010, Young became City Council President following Stephanie Rawlings-Blake taking over as mayor due to the indictment of Sheila Dixon. On April 2, 2019, Young was named acting mayor during the leave of absence by Mayor Catherine Pugh. Following Pugh's resignation on May 2, 2019, Young was fully vested as mayor of the city. In October of 2019, Young announced that he was running to retain his position as Mayor in the 2020 election. He lost the Democratic nomination for mayor, despite raising more money than the other candidates. Instead, Brandon Scott will be the nominee for Mayor of Baltimore in the 2020 election. ==Background== Jack Young graduated from Northern High School in Baltimore and attended Baltimore City Community College. Young was originally elected to represent Baltimore City Council District 2 in 1996, which he represented until 2003 when district lines were redrawn. After redistricting, he represented District 12 until he was appointed as City Council President in February 2010 to fill the vacancy left when Stephanie Rawlings-Blake was elevated to mayor. ==Career== At Johns Hopkins Hospital, Young first worked in the cafeteria and mailroom before joining the radiology department as a file clerk and eventually an administrator, helping digitize the department archives. By the late 1980s, Young began spending his evenings and weekends serving on the staff of Baltimore City Council member Mary Pat Clarke. From 2007 to 2010, Young was a manager at the Maryland Department of Human Resources. He has been a member of the Historic East Baltimore Community Action Council since 1995, and is a co-founder of the Broadway Development Foundation. Young created controversy in 2009 when he said that \\"it should be required that all top-level people live in the city,\\" referring to a report by the Baltimore Examiner that most Baltimore City police commanders don't live in the city. On February 1, 2010, WBAL-TV's Jayne Miller reported that Young himself owned a home in Harford County for which he had signed an affidavit that declared the Harford County home was his primary residence. Young said the house in Harford County had served as his summer home until he sold it in 2005. In February 2010, Councilman Young was unanimously nominated to fill the position of City Council President after former City Council President Stephanie Rawlings-Blake was sworn in as Mayor of Baltimore following the resignation of former Mayor Sheila Dixon. ==Mayor of Baltimore (2019 - )== Young was elevated to Acting Mayor on April 2, 2019, when then Mayor Catherine Pugh went on an indefinite leave of absence to recover from pneumonia. The announcement coincided with a scandal over a \\"self-dealing\\" book-sales arrangement by Pugh. On May 2, 2019, Pugh resigned and Young became mayor of the city. In July 2019, Young said that Baltimore will not assist ICE agents with immigration raids. He said in a statement: \\"Immigrants who call Baltimore home should not live in fear of family separation and deportation, and I will continue to do all that is in my power so that all Baltimore residents, including immigrants, feel safe and welcome in our city.\\" ===2020 Mayoral race=== After the first campaign finance reporting date in mid-January 2020, Young led all candidates with $960,000 cash on hand, Thiru Vignarajah reported having about $840,000, Brandon Scott had nearly $430,000 cash on hand and Sheila Dixon had raised $100,000. ==See also== *List of mayors of Baltimore *List of mayors of the 50 largest cities in the United States *Baltimore City Council President ==References== Category:1954 births Category:Living people Category:21st-century American politicians Category:African-American mayors of places in Maryland Category:African-American city council members in Maryland Category:Baltimore City Community College alumni Category:Baltimore City Council members Category:Maryland Democrats Category:Mayors of Baltimore Category:20th-century American politicians ","title":"Jack Young (politician)"},{"id":"60392017","text":"Vilva () is a rural locality (a settlement) and the administrative center of Vilvenskoye Rural Settlement, Dobryansky District, Perm Krai, Russia.

Bailliu is a Canadian economist who is currently the Senior Policy Advisor for the International Economic Analysis Department at the Bank of Canada. She was originally a research advisor for the Bank of Canada from 2005–2009, and obtained her position as Senior Policy Advisor in 2016. Bailliu has published multiple scholarly articles, focusing her research on international economics, international finance and applied econometrics. Some of Bailliu's recent research focuses on the Chinese economy, exchange rate and monetary policy regimes, and macroeconomic modelling. In 2016, Bailliu et al. published a working paper called \\"How Fast Can China Grow? The Middle Kingdom's Prospects to 2030\\" In addition, Bailliu also focuses a lot of her research on the economic growth of emerging market economies. In 2016, she published a paper called \\"Structural Reforms and Economic Growth in Emerging Market Economies\\" following structural reforms in the post 2008 Global Financial Crisis period. In 2000, Bailliu presented a paper with one her colleagues discussing exchange rate regimes and economic growth in emerging market economies. Her first article was published in July 2000, called \\"Private Capital Flows, Financial Development, and Economic Growth in Developing Countries\\", published by the Bank of Canada. == Education == Jeannine Bailliu attended high school at École Secondary Étienne-Brûlé and École Secondary Publique Louis-Riel. Bailliu completed her Bachelor of Commerce(B.Com.) in Honours at McGill University in 1990. In 1993, she received her master's degree in International Economics at the Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies in Geneve, Switzerland. Upon receiving her masters, Bailliu applied for her Doctor of Philosophy degree (PhD) in 1993 and obtained her PhD in Economics in 1999 at the University of California in Santa Cruz. == Career == Upon obtaining her PhD in Economics, Bailliu worked for the Organization of Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) in Paris. Afterwards, she started working for the Bank of Canada as a research advisor in 2005 for four years. In March 2005, Bailliu and Ramzi Issa published an internal note for the Bank which indicated that the Canadian dollar was undervalued. This received press coverage when it was released a year later under the Access to Information Act. As of 2010, Bailliu became an Assistant Chief of the Bank of Canada. As of September 2016, she obtained the position of the Senior Policy Advisor for the International Economic Analysis Department. == Scholarship and selected works == === Research on the Chinese economy === ==== How Fast Can China Grow? The Middle Kingdom's Prospects to 2030 (2016) ==== Jeannine Bailliu co-authored this research with her colleagues Mark Kruger, Argyn Toktamyssov and Wheaton Welbourn. Bailliu et al. (2016) used a Cobb-Douglas production function to forecast the growth of the Chinese economy to 2030. They used four key determinants: capital stock growth, labour growth, human capital growth and total factor productivity (TFP) growth. Their research suggests that the Chinese economy is expected to decelerate its growth from its current 7% growth rate to roughly 5% by 2030. Their attribute this slow down in growth to a decrease in future investments. ==== The Transmission of Shocks to the Chinese Economy in a Global Context: A Model-Based Approach (2010) ==== Baillui and colleague Patrick Blagrave analyze the factors behind shocks in the Chinese economy and how these shocks effect the G-3 countries, United States, the euro area and Japan Firstly, Baillui et al. (2010) find that foreign demand shocks are larger in China than other industrialized countries. This is namely due to the fact that China has a very open economy and one of the world's largest manufacturers. Henceforth, demand shocks from the international market will greatly impact the Chinese economy. In addition, their research also suggests that real equilibrium exchange rates are not only a large driving force for the Chinese economy but for the international market as well. Lastly, Baillui et al. (2010) argue that China's economy adapts slower to shocks than other developed countries because their monetary policy is not as effective as the real exchange rate. === Research on emerging market economies === ==== Structural Reforms and Economic Growth in Emerging Market Economies (2016) ==== Jeannine Bailliu and Christopher Hajzler suggest that growth in Emerging Market Economies (EME's) has slowed down since this 2008 Global Financial Crisis. Bailliu and Hajzler present structural reforms that could help increase productivity and thus help stimulate a substantial amount of growth following the financial crisis. Their research suggests that trade and foreign direct investment (FDI) liberalization, and strengthening property rights are key factors contributing to growth. Bailliu and Hajzler also suggest that investments in infrastructure and reforms to product market regulation (PMR) impact the level of growth in EME's. They mainly focus their research on emerging market economies such as China, India, Mexico, Brazil and Turkey. ==== Implications for Emerging-Market Economies (2000) ==== In a conference held by the Bank of Canada in November 2000, Jeannine Bailliu and Robert Lafrance, and Jean-François Perrault presented a paper called \\"Exchange Rate Regimes and Economic Growth in Emerging Markets.\\" They examine how exchange rates effect economic growth in 25 emerging market economies. Their findings suggest that flexible exchange rates are correlated with robust economic growth only when countries liberalize capital flows and already have an existing well-developed financial market. === First publication at the Bank of Canada === ==== Private Capital Flows, Financial Development, Economic Growth and Developing Countries ==== In July 2000, Bailliu published her paper on capital flows and economic growth in developing countries. Using data from 40 developing countries from 1975–95, Bailliu concludes that inward capital flows are positively correlated with economic growth in developing countries only when the country's domestic financial system is developed and stable. She suggests that inward capital flows will have negative effects on economic growth if the country has a poorly developed banking system. This is because governments of countries with underdeveloped banking systems could use the capital inflows for risky rather than productive investment. == Bank of Canada publications == * 2000, July: \\"Private Capital Flows, Financial Development, Economic Growth and Developing Countries\\" * 2002, June: \\"Does Exchange Rate Matter for Growth?\\" with Robert Lafrance and Jean-Francios Perrault. * 2002, December: \\"Exchange Rate Regimes for Emerging Markets\\" with John Murray. * 2003, June: \\"Explaining and Forecasting Inflation in Emerging Markets: The Case of Mexico\\" with Daniel Garcés, Mark Kruger, and Miguel Messmacher. * 2004, May: \\"Exchange Rate Pass-Through in Industrialized Countries\\" with Hafedh Bouakez. * 2004, June: \\"Exchange Rate Pass-Through and the Inflation Environment in Industrialized Countries: An Empirical Investigation\\" with Eiji Fujii * 2005, October: \\"What Drives Movements in Exchange Rates?\\" with Micheal R.

In 2011, she presented the company's Global Electrification Strategy at the National Association for Business Economics Conference. Hughes-Cromwick emphasized Ford's 2007 “blueprint for sustainability” plan to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 30 percent by 2020. This was to be done by developing new automobile technologies including reducing the weight of vehicles, adding hybrid electric vehicles, and employing an automatic “stop-start” mechanism in vehicles to reduce idling. The key strategy of Ford, as detailed by Hughes-Cromwick, was to provide a large variety of affordable electric and hybrid vehicles for consumers to choose from. === Senior Economist, Mellon Bank === Hughes-Cromwick worked as a senior economist with Mellon Bank from 1990-1996 during which time she focussed on macroeconomic forecasting, Latin market studies, and healthcare economics. === Assistant Professor of Economics, Trinity College Hartford === From 1987-1990, Hughes-Cromwick was an assistant professor of economics at Trinity College. She taught macroeconomics courses and was awarded an IBM/Sloan Foundation grant to incorporate computer use into the classroom. === Staff economist, Executive Office of the President === Upon completing her Ph.D. in Economics at Clark University, Hughes-Cromwick began working as a staff economist for the Reagan Administration from 1985-1987. During her time as a staff economist, Hughes-Cromwick worked primarily in the areas of monetary and fiscal policy and productivity growth. == Research == Hughes- Cromwick's most recent publication in partnership with Julia Coronado is entitled \\"The Value of U.S Government Data to U.S. Business Decisions\\". In this paper, Hughes-Cromwick and Coronado examine the economic value of government acquired data in financial decision making. They primarily consider the automotive, energy and financial services sectors as they are affected by government data. A specific focus of this report is the new era of big data generated by private companies. Hughes-Cromwick and Coronado consider how private data interacts with government data in informing business decisions. The authors stipulate the importance of public government data being provided in addition to data acquired by private companies. Hughes-Cromwick and Coronado emphasize that the value US government data is extremely high, and even increasing in recent times as improvements in technology allow more data to become readily accessible. They argue that subsidizing government data collection is merited. Hughes-Cromwick served as the President of the National Association for Business Economics from 2007-2008. As President, she presented her research on the changing economic climate at the October 6, 2008 National Association of Business Economics conference. As 2008 marked the 50th anniversary of the NABE, Hughes-Cromwick compared and contrasted the economy in 2008 and in 1958. She discussed the golden age of the 1950s and describes how the economy was booming prior to the recession of 1957-1958. She emphasized that the financial sector has become a larger portion of the US economy in the last 50 years, whereas the manufacturing sector has declined. When examining the financial situation in 2008, Hughes-Cromwick stated that financial disintermediation had benefited global economic growth in the short term but, in the context of the US housing market, severely punished consumers. She ended her presentation by stating that the key focus for the future is the challenge of determining an appropriate level of government regulation in the financial sector. During her time at the University of Michigan Energy Institute, Hughes-Cromwick reviewed the Michael Lewis book entitled “The undoing project: a friendship that changed our minds”. The book itself takes a psychological perspective on human decision making. Hughes- Cromwick further interpreted the book from an economic perspective and commented that the findings of Lewis are contrary to the current economic practice of forecasting. Hughes-Cromwick agreed with Lewis that predictions to an extreme degree of precision often ultimately prove to be false. She stresses that economists cannot precisely predict the future under uncertainty. Drawing on her own experience as the Chief Economist of Ford Motor Company from 1996-2014, she agrees with Lewis that it would not have been possible to provide accurate predictions relying solely on economic models and without consulting policy, financial and business experts. While completing her Ph.D. in Economics, Hughes-Cromwick conducted research concerning household energy use in Nairobi, Kenya. She exploited a household survey conducted by the Kenyan government which asked households to specify the type of energy they used for heating. The goal of the paper was to explain changes in fuel demand as a result of the price increase in petroleum in the 1970s. By looking at the effect of income changes on fuel demand, Hughes- Cromwick found that electricity consumption was income elastic, gas consumption was income inelastic, and charcoal consumption depended on charcoal appliance ownership and number of household members. == Media appearances == Hughes-Cromwick, as a Senior Economist with the University of Michigan Energy Institute, regularly attends the Transportation, Economics, Energy and Environment conference hosted by the institute. At the 2018 conference, she was a presenter on a panel on the subject of the Economics of Batteries and Electric Vehicle Charging. Hughes-Cromwick discussed that economics and technology of electrified vehicles have improved and predicted that retail pricing parity of electrified vehicles is expected within five years. She stipulated that a transition to electrified vehicles would have a large effect on reducing carbon dioxide emissions. In 2013, Hughes-Cromwick addressed the Society of Automotive Analysts Conference as the Chief Economist of Ford Motor Company. Her presentation at this conference primarily focused on sales predictions for Ford, both in the U.S. and in Europe. She projected U.S. automotive sales growth at 2 to 2.5% in the short term. In the long term, over the next five years, she predicted sales growth at approximately 5% on average. In 2017, Hughes-Cromwick appeared on CNBC to address the focus of the U.S. Federal Reserve before the September 2017 meeting. She discussed the current slow-down in job growth in the U.S and tight labour market conditions. She commented that she did not see any inflationary risk and that she predicted the increase in interest rates might be less substantial than people expected. == Honours and awards == * Certificate for Business Economics (CBE) Designation, 2015 * Global Fellow, Global Interdependence Center * Presidential Fellow, National Association for Business Economics * Special Recognition for input to Ford Motor Company's Board of Directors Strategy Offsite, 2003 * Award from President Reagan for Improving Government Efficiency * H.B.

She is the Chief of the Sustainable and Inclusive Value Chains Section and Head of the SheTrades Initiative at the International Trade Centre (ITC). == Life and education == Vanessa Erogbogbo was born in Kampala, Uganda and lived in several countries. She later moved to England and holds a dual citizenship to Uganda and the UK. Erogbogbo received an MBA from the London Business School, a MSc Information of Technology from Loughborough University and a B.Eng (with Honours) in Civil Engineering also from Loughborough University. Before her current position at the International Trade Centre, where she has worked since 2011, she had worked for the International Finance Corporation, the Standard Chartered Bank, and as an entrepreneur. She currently resides in Geneva, Switzerland where the International Trade Centre has its headquarters. == Work == Erogbogbo currently works at the International Trade Centre. === Women and trade === Frank Matsaert, Vanessa Erogbogbo and Minister Amelia Kyambadde at the Aid for Trade Global Review in 2017 The International Trade Centre's mission is to foster inclusive and sustainable economic development, and contribute to achieving the United Nations Global Goals for Sustainable Development. ITC works towards creating ‘trade impact for good’. Erogbogbo is the Chief of the Sustainable and Inclusive Value Chains Section and head of the SheTrades Initiative at the International Trade Centre, which is a joint agency of the World Trade Organization (WTO) and the United Nations (UN) and projects the idea of inclusivity and sustainability to aid the efforts in creating economic development that is sustainable. At the ITC, she oversees a team of people that, drive gender equality, environmental sustainability, social sustainability and labour standards in trade. Erogbogbo oversaw the creation of #shetrades when it was launched in 2015. The #shetrades initiative has the mission to “Champion quality data; Enact fair policies; Secure government contracts; Strike business deals; Enable market access; Unlock financial services; and Grant ownership rights”. The SheTrades initiative connects the private sector and institutions that support trade through government power to benefit women and increase female participation in export trade. Countries that oppress the participation of women in the market are often worse off and have lower GDPs than if they were to include female participation. In addition to this, women often care for their family and will make sure that household income is wisely used (ie. giving children access to education), which makes women exemplary candidates for economic support as it will benefit more than just one individual. Together, these reasons attribute to the reason #shetrades exists, which is a movement that Erogbogbo leads towards a sustainable means for women to access markets. === Sustainable and inclusive value chains === Erogbogbo oversees Sustainable and Inclusive Value Chains as the chief of this section of ITC. The section ensures that MSMEs benefit from trade by working with all stakeholders to embed sustainability and inclusiveness in value chains. The section comprises two large programmes on sustainability, and trade and gender, and supports mainstreaming of these concepts across ITC’s portfolio. The section has a range of projects working with multiple stakeholders, and has developed tools and methodologies for analysing markets and policies, strategic and operational research, assessing national trade performance, trade competitiveness and linkages between trade and development prospects. The “Trade for Sustainable Development (T4SD) programme (T4SD) focuses on three objectives. First, it aims to provide comprehensive, accessible and comparable information on voluntary standards. Second, it aims to assess the effects of conventional and sustainable trade and production practices on socio-economic development and the environment. And third, it provides technical assistance for SMEs to build their capacity and knowledge to implement green business practices. The SheTrades Initiative aims to connect 3 million women entrepreneurs and women-owned businesses to markets by 2021 through partnerships to build their skills and link them to trade and investment opportunities. SheTrades influences change across seven pillars of action requiring public and private contributions: championing gender disaggregated data collection; enacting gender sensitive trade policies; facilitating access of women to public procurement; supporting women connect to supply chains; enabling market access; facilitate women’s access to finance; granting ownership rights. The initiative is supported by a digital platform (web and mobile app) for women entrepreneurs to connect to buyers, investors, and new markets. == Authorship == Erogbogbo was a co-author, along with Ester Eghobamien and Elizabeth Pimentel, of the Gender Responsive Investment Handbook: Addressing Barriers to Financial Access for Women’s Enterprise. This work aligns with much of the #shetrades movement Erogbogbo pursues in that it addresses the issues of women not having the same access to markets that men do and the stunting of economic growth that can cause for the overall wellbeing of prosperity. Besides this, she has also written several pieces on her Women and Trade programme and other works to bring awareness to marginalization of women in developing worlds. She has written an article addressing the issue that addresses the gender gap that is driven further apart by the exclusion of women from African countries. == Media and conferences == Erogbogbo has led a talk at TEDx LausanneWomen to introduce some of her favorite success stories in woman-owned businesses and how more can be done to drive this empowerment and lead the future economy. Erogbogbo has participated in numerous media and speaking engagements, including the WTO public forums that are broadcast on the WTO website. In 2016, Erogbogbo was a panelist with moderators Katherine Hagen and Caitlin Kraft-Buchman with the topic “Women’s Economic Empowerment and Trade: Contributing to the Deliberations and Recommendations of the UN Secretary-General’s High-Level Panel on Women’s Economic Empowerment” all on inclusive trade. When addressing systemic constraints of sustainable development and gender equality as a trade issue, Erogbogbo explains that there is not one great reason for the supply side constraints nor one easy solution but that the transition from development community leading the way of the involvement of the private sector (which is key in resource accessing) is important in providing markets to women. In addition to this, women are already entrepreneurs but they either do not have the opportunities presented to them the same way men would have or even when they do they, they do not have the skills to access these opportunities because of a lack of knowledge and education on the issues. Erogbogbo supports the leveraging of technology access to women so that women can cross barriers and access markets with less resistance. The ITC has made efforts to create an app to make entering and accessing markets easier for women. The following year, Erogbogbo acted as the moderator for the 2017 WTO public forum sessions. == References == Category:People from Kampala Category:Living people Category:Ugandan economists Category:British economists Category:Ugandan women engineers Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:21st-century women engineers ","title":"Vanessa Erogbogbo"},{"id":"60392765","text":"Anke Sieloff (born 16 December 1965) is a German opera, operetta, and musical soprano and mezzo-soprano.

Since the 1993/94 season, Sieloff has been a permanent member of the Musiktheater im Revier ensemble. There she appeared in many operas and operettas, among others as Dorabella in Mozart's Così fan tutte, Rosina in Rossini's Il barbiere di Siviglia, Cherubino in Mozart's Le nozze di Figaro, Sextus in Mozart's La clemenza di Tito, Fenena in Verdi's Nabucco, and Jenny in Weill's Aufstieg und Fall der Stadt Mahagonny. She appeared also as Queen Eleonora in Donizetti's Rosmonda d'Inghilterra. In musicals, she appeared in Bernstein's Mass, was Maria in Bernstein's West Side Story, the title characters in both Porter's Kiss Me, Kate and Andrew Lloyd Webber's Evita, Reno in Porter's Anything Goes, Julie in Kern's Show Boat, and the Queen in Cy Coleman's The Life. She appeared as Polly Baker in Crazy for You and Ninotschka in Porter's Silk Stockings. In 2012, she was one of the three witches in the first German production of Die Hexen von Eastwick, a 2000 musical by Dana P. Rowe and John Dempsey based on Updike's novel The Witches of Eastwick. A review noted the witches' stage presence. Sieloff has made guest appearances on major German-language music stages. Sieloff is also an interpreter of lieder. She taught popular singing at the Musikhochschule Lübeck and classical singing at the Folkwang University of the Arts from 2006 to 2009. == Awards == At the age of 20, Sieloff won the first young talent award (Nachwuchspreis) at the Bundeswettbewerb Gesang in Berlin in the \\"Musical theatre\\" category. In 1990, she received the first Nachwuchspreis at the International Coloratura Singing Competition in Stuttgart, and in 1992 first prize at the Erika Köth Competition in Neustadt an der Weinstraße.

He also worked for a time in Saint Petersburg. He was a representative of the Biedermeier artistic style in Hungary.Romabuer János, Magyar Életrajzi Lexikon ==Biography== He came from an ethnic German family of nine children. He was born in Lőcse, Upper Hungary (present-day Levoča, Slovakia). His father, David Rombauer (1742–1806), an ethnic German Protestant, was a woodcarver. He may have studied with the Danish-born painter, in Besztercebánya (Banská Bystrica). At the age of nineteen, he began working as a portraitist in Pest (today Budapest). His first known miniature dates from 1802. Around 1805, probably in Bártfa (Bardejov), he met the Polish aristocrat, who, at that time, was in the service of the Russian government. Impressed by his talent, he invited him to his estate near Romaniv, in present-day Ukraine. By 1806, he was living and working in Saint Petersburg; teaching as well as painting. In 1818, he married Amalie Baumann (c.1795–1843), a Baltic German. During his stay, he became a member of the Imperial Academy of Arts and took part in their exhibitions. Vladimir Borovikovsky and Orest Kiprensky seem to have had a significant influence on his style. He and his wife returned to Hungary in 1824 and settled in Eperjes (Prešov), where his brothers Matthäus (1776–1840), a goldsmith, and Samuel (born 1798), a butcher, both lived. Their only child, Matilda, was born in 1829. He painted numerous portraits of the nobility, Hungarian as well as Russian, and many prominent citizens of the Kingdom of Hungary. In 1835, he received a commission to paint portraits of the faculty at the Lutheran College. He also created religious works. Altogether, he is known to have created 248 works, although many have been lost. His surviving works may be seen in the Hermitage Museum, the Tretyakov Gallery, the Hungarian National Gallery and the Slovak National Gallery.Beńová, Katarína (ed.): Ján Rombauer (1782 - 1849): Levoča - Petrohrad - Prešov.

Traditionally hailed as the state's founder, Tariácuri is credited with growing the Tarascan state from an individual city-state to the dominant power of the region. == Biography == Tariácuri (meaning \\"strong wind\\") was born into the uacúsecha clan, one of the most powerful families of the Lake Pátzcuaro basin, in the fourteenth century CE. His father and predecessor, Pauacume II, ruled as the lord of Pátzcuaro. Tariácuri's career began with a prophetic dream he had, in which the sun god Curicaueri— the patron deity of the uacúsecha— sent him forth to create and expand a unified Tarascan state. To put this ambition into practice, he first joined forces with allied cities, including Urichu, Erongarícuaro, Pechátaro, and Jarácuaro; he then began expanding the state's territory, first to the southwest and then throughout the entire Pátzcuaro basin. Tariácuri's military record was not perfectly successful— at one point, \\"enemies from Curinguaro\\" are described as attacking his homeland and forcing his nephews into flight— but this seems to have been a temporary setback, after which Tariácuri managed to resume his program of expansion.Roth-Seneff et al., 123–24. After Tariácuri's death, his domain was divided among several of his descendants: his son Hiquingaje received rulership of Pátzcuaro, while Tariácuri's nephews Tangaxoan and Hiripan were granted Tzintzuntzan and Ihuatzio respectively. They would follow Tariácuri's pattern, however, by maintaining an alliance and continuing efforts to expand the Tarascan state. == References == Category:14th-century rulers Category:Purépecha people Category:Year of birth unknown Category:Year of death unknown ","title":"Tariácuri"},{"id":"60392875","text":"Sobibor extermination camp was a World War II German death camp.

They were originally an all female 9-piece group from all different backgrounds and cultures. However, after signing to Transatlantic Records, the record company didn’t think the players were professional enough and brought in male replacements for their album.

Since 2000 he has worked and taught as Professor of Microbiology at University College Cork (UCC), Ireland. Recently he works mainly on the optimisation of yeasts for industrial biotechnology, but is also involved in the works with several other organisms. == Life and career == John Morrissey studied microbiology at University College Cork, graduating with a bachelor's degree in science in 1990. After graduating, he moved to the European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL) in Heidelberg, Germany, where he worked in David Tollervey's group on his doctoral thesis in the field of yeast molecular biology, in particular on specific snoRNA and the formation of rRNA in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. There he worked on translation and stability of mRNA in yeast. From 1998 to 2000 he worked and researched at the John Innes Centre (JIC) in Norwich, UK, and dealt with drug resistance of fungi to antibiotics produced by plants and with natural fungicides from bacteria. He continued this work after moving to University College Cork in 2000, where he collaborated mainly with the Irish microbiologist Fergal O'Gara to investigate the interactions of root bacteria with their host plants and their fungicidal properties. Since 2003, Morrissey has led his own research group as Professor of Microbiology at the UCC, whose research focus initially continued the previous work. Morrissey also investigated the ecological relationships of bacteria in the root system of plants, the fungicidal effects of root-associated Pseudomonas species and their potential use in environmental biotechnology and general biochemical relationships between bacteria and fungi. From 2010 onwards Morrissey was also working on the biotechnological use and metagenomics of marine organisms, especially of sponges (Porifera), to which he also wrote several book chapters. His current research focus is on the molecular biology and ecology of yeasts and the use of wild-type genetically modified yeasts for food, beverage or industrial biotechnology. Morrissey is particularly well known for his work on the food and industrial yeast Kluyveromyces marxianus'. Among other projects he leads, or has led, are the European research projects YEASTCELL (until 2017), YEASTDOC and CHASSY with a focus on yeasts as production organisms. == Awards and Functions == John P. Morrissey is Editor in Chief of the Editorial Board of the journal FEMS Yeast Research. Along with Prof Ken Wolfe of University College Dublin, he represents Ireland of the International Commission on Yeasts (ICY). Previously (2013 - 2017), he served as Chair of the Eukaryotic Division of the Microbiology Society and currently he is serving of a member of the Governing Council of the Microbiology Society.

He was also known as Daeng Ronggek, Tengku Chik and Daeng Kechil. A year later in 1811, his family moved to Singapura and established a governance there, where they settled near the river (present day Singapore River). In 1823, his father moved the family and followers to the 200 acres of land (part of Teluk Belanga area) as assigned by Sir Stamford Raffles, the palace known as Istana Lama was later completed in 1824. His father died at the palace on 8 December 1825 and was informally succeed by his elder brother Tun Haji Abdullah as the de facto Temenggong. In 1833, Daeng Ibrahim took over his brother Tun Haji Abdullah as the Temenggong of Johor. He later introduced Kangchu system to develop black pepper and gambir. However his appointment was only officially made known on 19 August 1841, and was witnessed by the 4th Governor of the Straits Settlements George Bonham and the Treasurer of Pahang Bendahara Tun Ali at the New Harbour (present day Keppel Harbour). On 10 March 1855, Ali Iskandar signed an agreement with the British Government in Singapore. In this agreement, Ali Iskandar would be crowned as the Sultan of Johor and receive 5,000 Spanish dollars with an allowance of 500 per month, in return, he agreed to transfer all his powers of the Johor territory to Daeng Ibrahim, except Kesang of Muar which would be the only territory under his control. Although the treaty recognised Ali Iskandar as the Sultan of Johor, but the title cannot be passed on to his offspring. Thus, Temenggong Daeng Ibrahim became the de facto Maharajah of Johor, he renamed this territory as Iskandar Puteri and administered it from his residence at Teluk Belanga. As the Sultan of Riau- Lingga Mahmud Muzaffar Shah was ousted by the Dutch on 7 October 1857 and Sulaiman Badrul Alam Shah II was installed as his successor. Raja Temenggong Daeng Ibrahim, aware of the situation and later in 1861, he signed a treaty with Bendahara Tun Mutahir of Pahang. The treaty recognized the territories of Johor, the Temenggong and his descendant's right to rule it, mutual protection and mutual recognition of Johor and Pahang. With the signing of this treaty, the remnants of the Empire had became two independent states, Johor and Pahang. ==Death== Daeng Ibrahim died in his house Istana Lama at Teluk Belanga on 31 January 1862 and was buried at the nearby Makam Diraja Teluk Blangah with his father. He was succeeded by his eldest son Abu Bakar. ==Legacy== A certain location was named after him in Singapore. * Masjid Temenggong Daeng Ibrahim ==References== Category:1810 births Category:1862 deaths Category:People of British Singapore Category:House of Temenggong of Johor ","title":"Temenggong Daeng Ibrahim"},{"id":"60393115","text":"The Balichak railway station in the Indian state of West Bengal, serves Balichak, India in Paschim Medinipur district.

The collection includes manuscripts, books, records, journals, letters, and antique works of art. In 1938, the Yōmei Bunko Foundation was established in its current location near Ninnaji Temple in northwest Kyoto by Fumimaro Konoe (近衛文麿, 1891 - 1945), then head of the family and prime minister of Japan.https://rmda.kulib.kyoto-u.ac.jp/en/collection/konoe Materials preserved in the archive illustrate over 1,000 years of Japan's history, ranging from the \\"Midō Kanpaku-ki\\",http://www.unesco.org/new/en/communication- and-information/flagship-project-activities/memory-of-the-world/register/full- list-of-registered-heritage/registered-heritage-page-5/midokanpakuki-the- original-handwritten-diary-of-fujiwara-no-michinaga/ the diary in his own hand of Fujiwara no Michinaga (藤原道長, 966 - 1028), one of the ancestors of the Konoe family, to 20th century materials relating to Fumimaro Konoe himself. The work of the archive includes making the collection available to researchers, conducting its own research, loaning items to exhibitions, and publishing facsimiles.Nawa Osamu, 2016, pp 1, 25Nawa Tomohiko, 2016, pp 262-264 In April 2012, Yōmei Bunko changed its legal status to become a public interest incorporated foundation.Nawa Osamu, 2016, p 26 ==The Konoe family and Yōmei Bunko== Konoe Fumimaro, founder of Yōmei Bunko Konoe Fumimaro, founder of Yōmei Bunko The Konoe family (近衛家) is a branch of the Northern Fujiwara (Fujiwara Hokke, 藤原北家). In the 12th century, the Fujiwara Clan monopolized the highest offices of state. Fujiwara no Tadamichi (藤原忠通, 1097 - 1164) served as sesshō (摂政, regent), kanpaku (関白, imperial advisor) and daijō-daijin (太政大臣, grand minister). The Konoe branch of the Fujiwara began with Tadamichi’s eldest son, Konoe Motozane (近衛基実, 1143 - 1166). Tadamichi’s third son, Kujō Kanezane (九条兼実, 1149 - 1207) founded the Kujō family (九条家). Later, the Takatsukasa (鷹司家) split from the Konoe, and the Nijō (二条家) and Ichijō (一条家) from the Kujō. These families would become known as the five regent houses.Nawa Osamu, 2016, pp 10-11 Successive heads of the Konoe family preserved many important documents, from family diaries to records of imperial court rituals and ceremonies. These were men who occupied the highest offices of the land, often as sesshō or kanpaku, throughout the Heian period. Although they had no official authority after the Heian gave way to the Kamakura period, the Konoe family continued to retain great influence as a regent house, deeply involved with court ritual and ceremony. The commitment to preserving the family legacy of important records grew from this long history of leading roles in both government and at court.Nawa Osamu, 2016, p 11 From generation to generation, the heads of the Konoe family, themselves usually both highly cultured and artistically accomplished, continued to organize and add to the collection.Nawa Osamu, 2016, p 11 The 13th head of the family, Konoe Masaie (近衛政家, 1445 – 1505), served as kanpaku and daijō-daijin during the upheavals of the Sengoku, or Warring States, period. During the Ōnin and Bunmei wars, he sent 50 boxes of the family records for safekeeping to Iwakura, on the northern outskirts of Kyoto. This ensured that, when the Konoe family mansion was burned down in the Ōnin War, the records survived.Nawa Osamu, 2016, p 23 The 16th head of the family, Konoe Sakihisa (近衛前久, pen name 龍山, ryūzan, 1536 - 1612), was serving as kanpaku during the Honnō-ji Incident that led to the collapse of the Ashikaga shogunate and the ascendancy of the Tokugawa. As kanpaku, he went on to form an alliance with Uesugi Kenshin, taking part in campaigns fought in Echigo and Kanto provinces. Despite living through one of Japan's most chaotic periods, Sakihisa found time to devote himself to cultural pursuits, becoming not only a renowned calligrapher, but also the leading waka and renga poet of his day.\\"Courtly Millenium − Art Treasures from the Konoe Family Collection\\", p 233 The 17th head of the family, Konoe Nobutada (近衛信尹, 1565 – 1614, in later life known as 三藐院, Sanmyakuin), was one of the Kan'ei Sanpitsu (寛永三筆, the \\"Three brushes of Kan’ei\\"), the pre-eminent calligraphers of the period.\\"Courtly Millenium − Art Treasures from the Konoe Family Collection\\", p 234 Nobutada had no heir, so he adopted his nephew Konoe Nobuhiro (近衛信尋, Ōzan (応山) 1599–1649), who was the fourth son of Emperor Go-Yōzei. Nobuhiro was also a man of high culture, notably skilled in calligraphy, tea ceremony, and renga poetry.\\"Courtly Millenium − Art Treasures from the Konoe Family Collection\\", p 236 In the mid Edo period, the 21st head of the family, Konoe Iehiro (近衛家熈, 1667 – 1736, pen name 予楽院, Yoraku-in) was also famed for his artistic accomplishments as calligrapher and tea master. Iehiro compiled the Ōtekagami, an album of outstanding works of calligraphy from all ages that is now a National Treasure, and also personally hand-copied a large number of old calligraphic masterpieces that are only known to us today through Iehiro’s transcriptions.\\"Courtly Millenium − Art Treasures from the Konoe Family Collection\\", p 87 On several occasions in modern times, beginning from 1900, this ancient family collection was entrusted to the Kyoto University Library (then the Kyoto Imperial University Library). Finally, Fumimaro Konoe, while serving as prime minister in the troubled times before and during the Second World War, decided to establish the Yōmei Bunko Foundation in 1938 as a permanent repository for his family’s historical archive. The name Yōmei was taken from an alternative name for the Konoe family which derived from the Yōmeimon Gate, one of the 12 gates to the imperial palace outer grounds, inside which stood the old Konoe mansion.Nawa Osamu, 2016, pp 11, 24, 25 The Yōmei Bunko occupies an approximately 8,550m2 site in the Rakusai district, close to Ninna-ji Temple. In addition to the original buildings, two repositories and a reading room/office building, the Sukiya style Kozansō was added in 1944. Important examples of Showa period architecture, these have all been registered as National Tangible Cultural Assets. Most of the grounds lie within one of Kyoto's Preservation Districts for Groups of Historic Buildings, and adjoining the site to the north is a 28,916m2 forested hilly area containing numerous ponds also destined for preservation as a protected environment and landscape.Nawa Tomohiko, 2016, p269 The library collection contains many significant historical journals written by court nobility in addition to the Midō Kanpaku-ki diary of Fujiwara no Michinaga. There are letters written in their own hand by emperors and prominent historical figures, items related to court ceremonies and ritual, old manuscripts relating ancient legends and imperial poetry collections. In addition to being an invaluable historical resource, the collection also represents a unique history of the art of calligraphy. While many of the ancestral treasures of the old aristocratic and daimyō families were lost in the aftermath of the Second World War, this legacy of the Konoe family survived thanks to the timely establishment of the foundation, a fact that makes the collection even more uniquely valuable. Exhibits are displayed in a room on the upper floor of the library, although as a rule this is not open to the general public without a letter of introduction. Facsimiles of major documents are regularly published in editions of the Yōmei Sōsho. ==Cultural properties== ===National treasures=== * \\"Mido Kanpaku-ki\\" (Diary of Fujiwara no Michinaga) set of 26 handscrolls (14 original, 12 transcribed) Attachments: \\"Abstract of the Midō Regent’s Diary\\" 5 handscrolls, and \\"Catalog of the Midō Regent’s Calendar\\" 1 hanging scroll.

Mora (born November 7, 1969) is an American economist who currently acts as administrator in the Office of Faculty Success & Diversity as well as Professor of Economics at the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley (UTRGV). She was also a former tenured faculty member at New Mexico State University. Mora's research focus is on labor economics, and on account of her research expertise on Hispanic socioeconomic outcomes across the U.S, she has been invited to share her research with the White House Initiative for the Educational Excellence of Hispanics; the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve system; The U.S Department of Labor; The White House Council of Economic Advisors; the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, and others. Mora is also currently the Director of the American Economic Association's National Science Foundation (NSF) funded Economics Mentoring Program, and a leader in the NSF-funded ADVANCE Program at UTRGV. Mora has also been a Research Fellow at the IZA Institute of Labor Economics since 2014 and serves on the Data Users Advisory Committee for the US Bureau of Labor Statistics and the Editorial board of Social Science Quarterly, amongst others. Mora was formerly a mentor in the Diversity Initiative for Tenure in Economics program, a board member and chair of the AEA's Committee on the Status of Minority Groups in the Economics Profession, as well as having served two terms as President of the American Society of Hispanic Economists. == Education == Mora earned her B.A in Economics at the University of New Mexico in December 1990, and her M.A in Economics at the same university in July 1992. Mora earned her Ph.D in Economics at Texas A&M; University in August 1996. == Scholarship == === \\"Hispanic Entrepreneurs in the 2000s: An Economic Profile and Policy Implications\\" (2013) === In this book Mora along with Alberto Davila conduct an in depth economic and policy analysis of Hispanic Entrepreneurs during the early 2000s, exploring issues related to socio-demographic characteristics, business cycles, employment/sales, use of digital technology and public policies affecting Hispanic business owners during this time. The book also exhibits comprehensive empirical analysis of issues affecting Hispanic populations including gender differences and inequality; Difference across Hispanic groups; and differences between natives and immigrant Hispanic populations. Mora and Davila explain that the early 2000s saw a dramatic increase in the Hispanic population and if these changes continued Hispanic entrepreneurship will likely become a large component of American job creation in the near future. The book was awarded the Winner of the 2014 Outstanding Academic Title Award sponsored by Choice. === \\"Population, Migration and Socioeconomic Outcomes among Island and Mainland Puerto Ricans\\" (2018) === In this book Mora with Alberto Davila and Havidan Rodriguez analyze large datasets such as the Puerto Rican community survey and the American community survey to create the first comprehensive analysis of socioeconomic and demographic effects of \\"La Crisis Boricua\\" in which include shrinking and rapidly aging populations, declines of high-tech industries, massive net out migration from the Islands, losses in both public and private sector careers, growing public debt, pension obligations and defaults on bondholder dividends. This crisis began with the 1817 Jones-Shafroth Act which granted Puerto Ricans U.S. citizenship that caused the influx of Islanders coming to the mainland. Mora explains differences in comparative earnings and the likelihood of being impoverished was lower in the Mainland. ===\\"Gender and Business Outcomes of Black and Hispanic New Entrepreneurs in the United States\\" (2014)=== This journal by Mora and Davila investigate the reasons why high failure rates are associated with women of color in entrepreneurship. In 2007 alone nearly half of businesses started by Black or Hispanic women closed down within the year. Mora and Davila found that even when controlling for firm level/partner characteristics unemployment rates in colored populations, businesses operated by women of color had a significantly higher likelihood of failure. This happens despite the existence of public support programs that encourage women of color to pursue entrepreneurial opportunities. Mora acknowledges that there have been several unsuccessful legislative attempts to change current programs such as the Women's business programs act of 2007 or the Small Business Administration. The paper finds that local economic conditions still play the major role in firm failure rates, for example states with high employment rates saw more firms fail within short periods of time, again emphasizing the importance of local economic conditions on the survivability of new businesses. === \\"Cross-Border Earnings of U.S Natives Along the U.S-Mexico Border\\" (2011) === This Journal article again is co-written with Alberto Davila, Mora and Davila investigate whether wages of U.S Born cross-border workers differentiate from those that stayed to work in the U.S. Mora also specifically analyses the 1990s, a decade where U.S Mexico trade boomed along with the expansion of the maquiladora industry. Mora and Davilla utilize U.S Census data from 1990 and 2000 to estimate earning functions and changes to U.S born Hispanic and non-Hispanic cross-border workers. They found that between the 1990s and 2000s U.S native cross-border workers increased significantly, however these premiums were only developed for non-Hispanics. This lead Mora and Davila to conclude that some U.S natives are able to find more lucrative career opportunities on the Mexican side of the border, this may be diminished by the increased restrictions for U.S-born residents to easily move between borders. === \\"Self-Employed Mexican Immigrants Residing along the U.S -Mexico Border: The earnings Effect of working in the U.S. versus Mexico\\" (2006) === In this Journal article Mora analyzes the U.S. census data from 2000 to explore the earnings of Mexican immigrants in US- Mexico border cities and if they differentiate based on work location. Mora's results show that Mexican entrepreneurs that live in U.S.-Mexico border cities who primarily work in Mexico earn a premium over their counterparts that are employed in the U.S. This earnings gap is even more prominent when focusing on Mexican entrepreneurs that lack U.S. citizenship. This leads Mora to conclude that policies that aim to reduce labor flows and economic trade across the U.S.-Mexico border may cause entrepreneurial activities of foreign-born U.S. residents to decrease in intensity. === \\"The Increasing Importance of Hispanics to the U.S. workforce\\" (2015) === To commemorate the 100th anniversary of the Bureau of Labor Statistics' Monthly Labor Review Mora writes this article to analyze the changes to the U.S. labor force. Mora notes that the growth of women in the workforce as well as the number of Hispanics in the U.S. has grown significantly. Mora notes that the growth for Hispanic women in the workforce grew almost 157 percent compared to 124 percent for their male counterparts. Mora follows this with the notion that access to quality education is vital when trying to decrease inequality, Hispanics on average receive less-education than non-Hispanics and this disparity has stayed rather constant despite increased Hispanic participation in higher education. Mora argues that this under-education of Hispanics causes numerous economic, social and labor market repercussions such as low-wages, high unemployment and increased poverty rates. Therefore, with a growing Hispanic population in mind, these educational outcomes will have further consequences than just to the Hispanic community and will have a significant effect on the structure of the U.S. workforce. == References == Category:Living people Category:1969 births Category:American women economists Category:American women educators Category:21st-century American economists ","title":"Marie T.

It is a standalone sequel to the 2011 Lucky McKee film The Woman, in which McIntosh played the title role. ==Plot== At the end of the previous film, Darlin', Peggy, and Socket Cleek joined the feral woman to live in the wilderness. Years later, Peggy and Socket are gone, while the now teenage Darlin' has developed a feral personality. One day, Darlin' is found by civilization and taken to a hospital, then a Catholic boarding school called St. Philomena's, where the staff and other students attempt to civilize her. A nurse named Tony who was the first to find and befriend her tries to look out for her, but is repeatedly turned away by the school for being gay. Though she has forgotten how to speak, she is renamed Darlin' after the name on her bracelet. She slowly regains her ability to speak and befriends some of the other students, especially a trouble-making tomboy named Billy, but has trouble adjusting to modern life and is disturbed by the school's teachings about the Devil. A greedy bishop attempts to exploit her for fame and fortune. Eventually, the feral woman enters the city and kills everyone in her path to retrieve her adoptive daughter Darlin', though she befriends a group of homeless prostitutes. The bishop is a pedophile who regularly preys on the girls, and had preyed on the school's Sister Jennifer when she was a child. He tries to seduce Darlin', only to discover she is pregnant. She reveals that her sister Peggy had died in childbirth after having a stillborn child, which made Socket run away. A few months ago, she and the woman captured a hiker and they had sex before the woman killed him. The woman made her go to civilization so that she could deliver the baby safely. However, due to the school's teachings and what happened to Peggy, Darlin' believes the baby inside her is the Devil, and repeatedly pleads with God to save her. When Darlin' is about to receive her First Communion, she attempts either suicide or to induce a miscarriage by drinking bleach, but all it does is make her sick. During the ceremony, Sister Jennifer plays a recording of the bishop confessing his crimes, which makes several people walk out in disgust. Darlin' bites a chunk out of his hand, but suddenly goes into labor. The woman and the homeless prostitutes storm the church and the woman kills the bishop. Tony, his boyfriend Robert, Sister Jennifer, and Billy help deliver Darlin's child, a girl. Darlin' tells the woman to take the baby far away. As sirens approach, Tony, Robert, Sister Jennifer, and Billy tend to Darlin', while the woman takes the baby and walks out. ==Cast== *Lauryn Canny as Darlin' Cleek *Bryan Batt as The Bishop *Nora- Jane Noone as Sister Jennifer *Cooper Andrews as Nurse Tony *Pollyanna McIntosh as The Woman *John McConnell as Dr. Grant *Geraldine Singer as Sister Grace *Maddie Nichols as Billy *Mackenzie Graham as Bug *Jeff Pope as Clown *Eugenie Bondurant as Mona *Sabrina Gennarino as Charity *Thomas Francis Murphy as The Cardinal *Damon Lipari as Robert Lauren Ashley Carter and Alexa Marcigliano reprise their The Woman roles as Peggy and Socket Cleek, respectively. ==References== ==External links== * Category:2019 films Category:American sequel films Category:American films Category:English- language films Category:2019 horror films Category:American horror films ","title":"Darlin' (2019 film)"},{"id":"60393350","text":"Edwin Anthony Biedermann (5 July 1877 - 31 October 1929) was a British sportsman who represented Great Britain in jeu de paume at the 1908 Summer Olympics. ==Early life== Biedermann was born on 5 July 1877 in Kensington, London, the son of Alfred Biedermann and his wife Henrietta (Helene) Biedermann.

It has 3 pairs of legs that are modified to help it burrow into sand. Although the underside of adult beetles is a pale whitish yellow in colour, its hardened forewings (elytra) are polymorphic. The colour of an individual matches that of the sand where it lives. On beaches with black sand, around 96% of beetles are a brown-black colour. On beaches with pale sand, around 98% of beetles are a pale milky colour. Spotted and mottled beetles have also been observed on beaches with mixed sand types. The larva is white and u-shaped and resembles a small wire worm. == Behaviour == The seaweed darkling beetle lives in a narrow band at the top of the high tidal zone. During the day, it burrows up to 30 centimetres below the sand surface, often under seaweed and marine algae. It emerges after dark to feed on cast up seaweed and marine algae. When seaweed is picked up by predatory seabirds, it has been observed as falling out, running a short distance, and burrowing back into the sand. The beetle is thought to have an internal biological clock. Despite being kept in total darkness, the timing of its activity changed with the tidal cycle, which suggests that individuals are able to change their location on the shore with spring and neap tides, allowing them to feed on the seaweed left behind. The species is able to survive rafting on seaweed when it is washed out to sea at high tide. This is thought to be another way for beetles to travel up and down the shore. == References == Category:Laniidae Category:Tenebrionidae genera Category:Beetles described in 1846 ","title":"Seaweed darkling beetle"},{"id":"60393375","text":" Eastern Sword was an unarmed 3,785-ton steam merchant ship that was completed in 1920 at the Uraga Dry Dock Co.

The poems 'Insomnia at Dawn', together with the first and fifth parts of 'Angel of Silence', were included in the anthology Modern Chilean Poetry (1931), edited by Rubén Azócar as a preliminary to the collection being published. For the first edition of his book, Cáceres initially relied on two proposals for the prologue, written by poets Ángel Cruchaga Santa María and Pablo de Rokha. As neither version was totally to the author's liking, he requested a third and final version from Vicente Huidobro, who had returned from France the previous year. This generated strong debate between Rokha and Huidobro, which was recorded in the newspaper La Opinión. The book was published thanks to the financial support of his brother, Raúl Cáceres Aravena, and his modest income working as a high school professor of castellano. Once published, the author realised that the first edition was full of errors which enraged him. Cáceres gathered all the copies he could and burned them in a bonfire in his courtyard. Only a small number of first edition copies were saved. Some possibly remained in the hands of friends, such as the poet Eduardo Anguita. His brother Raúl kept at least one copy, while only two are currently being preserved in the National Library of Chile. According to research, there are no further copies in other public libraries in Chile. These few remaining copies allowed the posthumous reprinting of the collection, by the Chilean poet and essayist Pedro Lastra, who textually transcribed the work in 1959, when photocopiers were yet to exist. The first reissue took place in 1996, in the collection Between Seas by Chilean publishers LOM Ediciones. This seventy page reprint was prepared by Lastra, who included a graphic appendix and additional epilogues. That same year it was published in the Vita nuova series by publishers Ediciones el Tucán de Virginia, in Mexico City, though only part of Lastra's additions were incorporated. The following year, in 1997, the book was published as part of the Editorial Fund series by small publishing house Venecia de Caracas, in Venezuela, this time including of the material from the first reissue. The author died in 1943. == Content == This collection is formed by the following fifteen poems:In both the original edition published by Norma and the edition edited by Lastra for LOM Ediciones, the poems are preceded by a prologue by Vicente Huidobro. In Lastra's reissue, he includes diverse additional material after the poems: * The only known, preserved prose text written by the author, entitled \\"I, old and new words\\" written as a poetic statement and testimonial to precede his selection of poems published in Anthology of New Chilean Poetry (1935). * A 'Notes' section, where he refers briefly to his conservation of the syntactic peculiarities used by Cáceres, and to the small corrections made from the comparison between the original edition and the poems collected in the Anthology of New Chilean Poetry. * A \\"graphical Appendix\\" which includes a photograph of the first edition cover, a drawing of the bust of Cáceres by Antonio R. Romera, included first in Andrés Sabella's article entitled, \\"Luis Omar Cáceres: the poet whose death shames justice\\" (published in Las Últimas Noticias, 6 September 1943 and then in the 5th issue of Hacia magazine); an excerpt from the article by Antonio Acevedo Hernández, entitled \\"Omar Cáceres has launched himself in supreme flight\\" (published in Las Últimas Noticias, 15 September 1943), which includes a blurred photograph of his face and the cover of the fifth issue of Towards magazine (September 1955), dedicated to the poet. * Two epilogues: \\"Omar Cáceres returns\\" by Pedro Lastra, and \\"A ghostly poet\\" by Volodia Teitelboim, both of which refer to aspects of the author's personal life. == Reception and impact == The first publication of this book generated controversy within the Chilean literary community of the time, due to the lawsuit mentioned above between Pablo de Rokha and Vicente Huidobro; regarding the production of the book's prologue. However, this first edition could not be read by many, due to the aforementioned massive burning of the copies made by its author. Despite being Cáceres's only book, the 1996 reissue was enough to be considered a benchmark within Chilean avant-garde poets. This collection of poems has motivated various studies by critics and scholars, as well as the respect and admiration of various writers, such as Chilean Andrés Sabella and Venezuelan Miguel Gomes. == Style == The lyrical poetry of this work is framed within Latin American avant-garde, with Freudian, Pantheistic y Jungian elements. Esoteric and metaphysical elements are also attributed to this collection; elements, that for Eduardo Anguita, links Cáceres to his contemporary, the writer Miguel Serrano. It is considered a profound, questioning, lucid and refined work, with a constant exploratory attitude and a disintegration of the \\"poetic self\\". == Analysis of the collection == In this collection, written in the later years of the author's youth, the writer Luis Merino Reyes (1912-2011) recognises a great love for life, which is expressed in intense and varied emotions. Carl Gustav Jung, founder of Analytical psychology. For the academic Miguel Gomes,Defence of the Idol can be interpreted as an initiation journey of the \\"poetic self\\" in \\"self\\" discovery, a central archetype of the collective unconscious. For the writer and academic Miguel Gomes (b. 1964), the work uses a \\"militaristic\\" vocabulary; which is exemplified by the use of the word \\"defence\\" in the title of the book. Gomes argues that the enunciation of poems maintains a semi- narrative continuity and precise direction throughout all the poems. Any apparent deviations could be considered a catalytic component or means of generating suspense. According to this argument, the discourse of the whole work is constructed by the mythologem of \\"the search for the centre\\" or the \\"myth of the fall\\"; the idea that the \\"poetic self\\" is experienced as an evolution or initiation journey that consists of several stages: the plundering of the external, descent into the psyche, alteration of lucidity, recognition of authenticity, panic and uncertainty, loss of reason, reconstruction and encounter with the true self. This journey would correspond to the development of the phenomenon of Jungian synchronicity, in which the \\"poetic self\\" is disintegrated and transmuted (but in this case, it also transcends) throughout the different poems into a new image, that of the 'idol'. The 'idol' implicitly acts as the source of the lyric and in the Jungian sense would be the 'self' to whom the 'ego' is subordinate. For Gomes, Huidobro's description of this work in his prologue, fits perfectly with the principles of Jungian psychology. More specifically, for Gomes, the title of the first poem, \\"Foaming Mansion\\", refers to the fragility of a space, which commences the book’s systematic rupture of our conceptions of the space-time of reality. For example, every trope of the second stanza breaks with the accustomed stability, stillness or uniqueness in presenting images of landscape, time, sky and the journey. The syntactic dis-articulation produced by the punctuation of each verse, produce a staccato rhythm that reinforces this breakdown of reality, in pursuit of the discovery of the unknown. A fact that is articulated more specifically towards the penultimate stanza, where the transition from \\"I\\" to the poetic voice itself is perceived, i.e. the \\"self\\", baptised in the last stanza as the \\"unknown idol\\". This enunciation is emphasised in the following poems. The radical introspection of the \\"poetic self\\" in this first poem is repeated in \\"Insomnia at Dawn\\", whose title superimposes psycho-physical states, time and space, and whose content, in the midst of deixis and displacement of meaning, takes the form of a prayer addressed to that \\"self\\", to break with the vigil of the \\"I\\". In the sonnet \\"Words to a Mirror\\", the \\"I\\" begins to explore its interior, with restrained tension, in search of its true \\"abyss\\". What in 'Foaming Mansion' was an intention to \\"unfold his words\\" on paper, here is an intention to unfold them in the mirror, which begins to insinuate a meta-linguistic plot that will become more evident in the successive poems. The journey towards the \\"inner abyss\\" becomes explicit towards the sixth poem, 'Opposing Anchors', where the speaker is placed in the same journey by the psychic route, in a centrifugal movement that alters time and space. In ‘Angel of Silence’, the \\"I\\" in transition experiences feelings already imperceptible by the senses, and in his introspection recognises the desired authenticity of the \\"self\\". In the following five poems, the story of the fall adopts the tone of the initiation voyage and the traveller begins to experience anguish, fear, horror, before the absolute loss of reason. Thus, for Gomes, \\"Inconstant Oracle\\" is a suffocating poem, with moments of mistrust and uncertainty for the journey undertaken. However, in ‘Second Form’ (connected with ‘Words to a Mirror’) and ‘Against the Night’, an attempt of consolation is observed, in opposition to the anguish and hope for a happy arrival. In ‘Uninhabited Blue’ lies the anguish of ‘Inconstant Oracle’, but in ‘Native Figure’, hopelessness and hope connect, in the process of rebuilding the subject from nothing. The final three poems constitute the celebration of arrival. ‘Song to the Fugitive’ acts as \\"apotheotic synthesis\\" of all the story told so far. This poem ends with capital letters, with hurried words and daring animosity, with the fusion of the first and second person, using these elements to emphasise the disintegration of appearances and time. The following poem, \\"Enlightenment of the Self\\", portrays the enclosures where the \\"idol\\" dwells, in which the conventional physics are altered or non-existent. Finally, in ‘Visiting Extremes’, the initial motivation of the trip is reiterated and the triumph of the avant-garde undertaking is manifested, along with the absence of time and external reality. Eduardo Anguita agrees with Gomes regarding Cáceres’s interest in the mysteries of \\"self\\", and highlights his attempts to describe spectral figures and dreams using, among other resources, hyphens to forcibly divide words. According to critic Marcelo Pellegrini, the reference in the poem \\"Opposing Anchors\\" to a car on the road is a clear avant-garde gesture, which shows an interest in these machines; an interest which was shared by very few of his contemporaries, with the notable exception of Vicente Huidobro. Huidobro himself also dedicated poems to motor vehicles. However, Pellegrini warns, what in Huidobro is a \\"childish enthusiasm\\", is in Cáceres an irony that brings him closer to another contemporary of his, the Portuguese Fernando Pessoa; whose work Cáceres was unaware of. Pellegrini relates the poem \\"Opposing Anchors\\" with \\"The wheel...\\" by Pessoa, which was published under his pen-name Álvaro de Campos. == References == == Bibliography == * This article is in part derived from «Omar Cáceres: Defensa del ídolo» from the portal Memoria Chilena, whose original content was published under the Licencia Creative Commons Atribución-CompartirIgual 3.0 Unported. * Category:Chilean poetry collections Category:1930s poetry books ","title":"Defence of the Idol"},{"id":"60393580","text":"Kuligino () is a rural locality (a village) in Dobryansky District, Perm Krai, Russia.

It was made specifically for broadcast on BBC Radio Lancashire's programme On the Wire, which the song references frequently in its narrative. The song, built on a repetitive, hypnotic and atmospheric musical backdrop heavily inspired by dub reggae and Lancastrian post-punk, features the voice of \\"Lucy\\", a \\"spryte of the air\\" existing as a disembodied female voice speaking in a deadpan but constant Lancashire dialect. In an often self- referencing monologue text from her perspective, intended to resemble a conspiracy theory, she details the apocalyptic \\"master plan\\" of the Devil being executed in Lancashire that has been explained to her by the mysterious, evil and shadowy figure \\"Alan\\", chronologically beginning with the Pendle witches who perpetuated the beginning of capitalism into the \\"dark Satanic mills\\" of the Industrial Revolution, and reaching the present day with Lucy tracing the origin of BBC Radio Lancashire to Revelation 13, leading to the voice of radio host Allan Beswick (whose voice appears on the record in character). Musical entities linked to Lancashire, such as The Fall, Mick Hucknall and The Beatles, as well as figures important to the politics of the narrative like Marx and Engels and Lee \\"Scratch\\" Perry, are mentioned by Lucy but all have their names changed or distorted. The song also frequently makes use of production effects that are relative and tie into the subject matter, including delay effects, backmasking, and psychedelic layers of Hammond organ playing. ==Legacy== Upon being premiered on the radio programme On the Wire in 2006, completing the work's intent, and released in 2007 (originally on red 12-inch vinyl), Lucy Over Lancashire received critical praise. Marc Riley on BBC 6 Music remarked \\"Love it, absolutely love it – great isn’t it?

He studied at the Herkomer School of Art in Bushey from 1889–92 and later went on to become the head of school. He rose to become the President of the Royal Society of Portrait Painters in 1945 following a spell as vice-president (1934–45) and was also the Director of the Royal Academy. He first became an associate of the Royal Academy in 1919 (ARA) and was then elected as an Academician (RA) in 1926. In 1944 he was elected as a senior Academician (Senior RA) and became Director of Schools in 1927. After studying art in Dumbarton, George Harcourt initially worked as an interior decorator of salons and luxury cabins at the local shipyard Denny Brothers Shipbuilding. In 1888 he went to Bushey (north of London) and enrolled in the Herkomer School of Art. The school, founded by the German-born painter Hubert von Herkomer (1849-1914) in 1883, enjoyed a very good reputation in England at the time and was known for its unconventional educational practice. As one of the best students, Harcourt later became a lecturer at this art school. Later, he taught at the prestigious London Slade School of Fine Art, in which his daughter Anne studied. Over the years, Harcourt's style of painting changed from a Pre-Raphaelite influenced naturalism (here mainly genre paintings, more rarely landscapes) to an almost photorealistic portraiture. This perfection not only gave him a great reputation among colleagues, but also secured him a good income as a portraitist of the British upper class. He submitted to the Royal Academy of Arts his diploma thesis (A Portrait of Miss Anne Harcourt), this proved he had skills that went beyond the naive kitsch of his earlier years. In 1893 George Moore reviewed the artworks at the Royal Academy commenting in The New Review, London, on a portrait exhibited there by George Harcourt - At the Window. == Paintings == File:'The_Tracing'_by_George_Harcourt_(14581392250).jpgThe Tracing (1897) File:Clement_Attlee_by_George_Harcourt,_1946.jpgClement Attlee (1946) * 1893: At the Window (exhibited at the Royal Academy) * 1894: Psyche (issued in the Royal Exchange in London) * 1899: Forgiven (now in the National Gallery in Adelaide , Australia) * 1901: Meriel, Cynthia and George Perkins * 1905: \\"Melody\\" (exhibited at the Museo de Arte de Ponce in Puerto Rico) * 1910: The Birthday (now in the Lady Lever Art Gallery, Port Sunlight near Liverpool) * 1914: George Nathaniel Curzon (started by Herkomer, completed by Harcourt, owned by Oxford University) * 1920: Portrait of a young girl * 1921: Portrait of Miss Anne Harcourt (his daughter later became his pupil) * 1924: Sir Maurice Fitzmaurice (the admiral was director of the British secret service of the Royal Navy NID) * 1931: The Krupp von Bohlen and Halbach Family (owned by the Krupp Foundation in the Villa Hügel) == Awards == Harcourt received in 1912 a gold medal at the International Exhibition in Amsterdam. In 1921 he submitted to the jury of the Royal Academy of Art, a portrait of his daughter Anne. He was admitted in 1926 as a full member of the Academy (RA). Up to this point he was an Associate Royal Academician (ARA), which he had held since 1919. He also briefly became Deputy Director of the Royal Academy Schools.

Starting with his debut rural novellas and research on the ‘Western Influences on Marathi Drama 1818-1947’ Patil set new trends in rural fiction. His Icchamarn is the compendious epic novel on a village. It is regarded as a masterpiece of gramin (rural) fiction. He is the recipient of four Government of Maharashtra Awards for extraordinary literary works and also other thirteen literary awards. He is the founder of Aranyanand Shikshan, Sahitya va Sanskriti Pratisthan and Anand Granthsagar Prkashan. == Education == Patil was born on 3 July 1945 in a remote village in the range of Sahyadri Mountain in Maharashtra. He joined the ‘Earn and Learn’ scheme of Karmveer Bhaurao Patil and received Merit scholarship for M.A. in Entire English from shivaji university Kolhapur, Maharashtra. The UGC Teachership and British council visitorship enabled him to submit the meritorious Ph.D. dissertation which was published both in English and Marathi. ==Career== Dr. Patil has contributed immensely in field of education and literature. His contributions are shortly elaborated here. ===Teaching=== Patil taught English language and Literature in various colleges of Rayat Shikshan Sanstha for 24 years and later comparative Literature and creative writing in Department of English, Goa University and school of Languages and Literature in Swami Ramanand Teerth Marathwada University, Nanded. After retirement he was the visiting Professor of Delhi University, Patan and Nagpur University. ===Literary career=== Patil’s first short story ‘Khep' published in the most prestigious periodical ‘Satyakatha’(1971) and novella Kagud in 'Mouji' (1984) earned him the nickname ‘Kagudwala’ Patil given by stalwart fivtionist Shankar Patil. Anand Patil become a name to be conjured with in rural fiction. His autobiographical element and mastery of rural language was so powerful that he was described as a rising sun of Marathi rural writing. Once after he joined the Goa University as a Reader in English he has reached to the new heights. He reached where Maharashtrian writers have reached seldom including publishing articles in Ariel, comparative and culture studies, Oxford and Cambridge Companionshttps://www.cambridge.org/core/books/companion-to-comparative- literature-world-literatures-and-comparative-cultural-studies/comparative- literature-in-indian-languages/4BE694A98F43DAA043D082AA3CA3720D in the Western countries. Patil ventured where no Marathi Marathi writer had ever trod . He was turned down by those so called scholars who had never published a single book in Maharashtra. This cultural tuen made him the leading comparatist and culturalist in India who went abroad for seven times on the academic tours. His book on 'Comparative Literature :Theory and practice' translated in to Hindi is a text book all over India. Whatever genre he tried he made his work. For example, his ‘Patalachi Londanvari’ translated in to Kannada and Hindi is considered the first true travel writing of the marginal Indian, and ‘In search of my Kolhapur’ the first travel of a District, ‘Granthani Rachlela Mahapurush’ a first literary biography and so on. As a creative writer he is Ngugi wa Thiong'o of Marathi and as a culturalist –comparatist he is Raymond Williams of India. ==Bibliography== ===Novels=== #Kagud ani Shavali.

The report suggested reforming the Egyptian government to preserve British influence, establish a 'veiled protectorate' and ensure that Britain was the sole western influencer in Egypt. == Background == In 1875 due to the deteriorating economic situation in Egypt (the Khedive was £100 million in debt) Isma'il Pasha was forced to sell his 44% share of the Suez Canal Company to the British government under Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli for the fee of £4 million. Disraeli had quickly received consent from Parliament and Queen Victoria after being granted a loan from Lionel de Rothscild to secure the shares. Facing repayment issues in 1876 Isma'il was forced to submit to Anglo- French Dual Control of Egypt's finances. The international commission set up was intended to bring stability to the nation and empower the Khedive. The intention of Dual Control In Egypt was not to seize territory or integrate it into their respective empires; they had hoped to oversee the situation without a territorial occupation. This plan was thwarted when an anti-western nationalist uprising led by Ahmed 'Urabi sprung up in 1880 and seized power from the new Tewfik Pasha in 1881. Following an anti-European riot in 1882 killing 50 Europeans and fearing a secret deal between France and 'Urabi, Britain was forced to intervene to protect their interests in the Suez Canal. Britain invaded with a expeditionary force of around 40,000 led by General Wolseley in September of 1882, defeating 'Urabi at the Battle of Tell El Kebir. The subsequent occupation of Egypt was against Liberal policy of Gladstone's government in London, hence Dufferin was sent to report on the situation in Egypt. Gladstone had hoped he could withdraw from Egypt as he had done in the Transvaal once the situation was safe, and restore the pre-'Urabi status quo. == The Report == The report had not suggested what Gladstone had wanted; his hopes to re-establish dual control in Egypt were shattered. Dufferin acknowledged that the occupation had been beneficial to Egypt and suggested there was a distinct need to develop the nation to restore economic order to Egypt. The report stated that interests of the Suez Canal Zone should always be paramount in the governance of Egypt. Dufferin's suggestion on the direction of governance was vague. He rejected direct rule like a colony and indirect rule through a British representative like that seen in the Princely States in India. His suggestion was that a balanced approach was necessary, he concluded that ' The Valley of the Nile could not be administered from London as it would arouse the permanent hatred and suspicion of the Egyptians'. His suggestion was that British rule must appear to helping the Egyptians in their own self-governance.Mansfield, P, (1992), p. 109 It was from this he suggested that over time more Egyptians should be steadily re-included in government. Another shock to Gladstone was Dufferin's statement about the need to abandon dual control as the relationship with the French was unworkable and the necessary reforms and development needed must be introduced by a sole ruler and that would be Britain. Accompanied with this was more bad news for Gladstone's Liberal foreign policy of anti-imperialism, Dufferin explained that to fix the issues in Egypt a British presence in government was needed for 5 years and military occupation would need a longer presence. Gladstone was unable to pull out of Egypt as he had hoped. == Aftermath == The report shaped the eventual form that rule over Egypt would take. Evelyn Baring, 1st Earl of Cromer, was sent to Egypt as Consul-General later in 1883 and upon arrival he concluded in alliance with Dufferin's views that a long term British presence was necessary to prevent chaos.Hyam, R, (1976) p. 183 Reforms in Egypt largely followed Dufferin's report, the Granville Doctrine (named after the Foreign Secretary Granville Leveson-Gower, 2nd Earl Granville) was adopted to ensure British dominance of government was maintained during the occupation. The doctrine allowed for any Egyptian minister to be dismissed if they did not comply with British policy. A Legislative Council and General Assembly was set up to develop Egyptian politics and westernise their system of government. Contrary to Dufferin's suggestion of including Egyptians in government, over the years of occupation the numbers of Britons in government increased, by 1905 there were around 1,000 British officials in office. This Increased British commitment to Egypt and the idea of a 5 year occupation was not administratively possible. == References == Category:1883 in Egypt Category:1883 in the United Kingdom Category:1883 documents ","title":"Dufferin Report"},{"id":"60394842","text":"Frello is a surname, may refer to: * Jorge Luiz Frello Filho, better known for his stage name Jorginho, Brazil-born Italian international footballer with Italians ancestry * Otto Frello (1924–2015), Danish painter, graphic artist, cartoonist and illustrator ","title":"Frello"},{"id":"60394844","text":"Old Scars, New Wounds is the second album by American heavy metal supergroup Act of Defiance, released on September 29, 2017, for label Metal Blade Records and produced by Dave Otero, Steve White and group member/guitarist Chris Broderick.

In the autumn of 1944, prisoners of the Schörzingen concentration camp built a shale oil factory on this site during a construction period of about three months. The Memorial is located outside the village of Schörzingen, today a district of Schömberg in the Zollernalbkreis in Baden-Württemberg, at the foot of the Nordtrauf in the Swabian Alb. The plant was one of ten production sites of the Company Wüste, the code name of an industrial complex consisting of concentration camps and industrial plants of the Nazis, in order to extract the increasingly scarce fuel from domestic oil shale towards the end of the Second World War. Under partly murderous conditions, concentration camp prisoners had to set up various oil shale plants from seven subcamps of the Natzweiler-Struthof concentration camp for experimental purposes and for the production of shale oil in order to work in them subsequently. On the grounds of the Memorial site, a bronze sculpture in a trough excavated by prisoners commemorates the events.

From 2007 to 2012, he served as the technical director for Carnegie Mellon's Cybersecurity Laboratory (CyLab). During this time he built a research project called SCI-FI (Secure Communications Infrastructure for a Future Internet). A research project aimed at building a next-generation secure internet architecture. The project later got renamed into SCION (Scalability, Control, and Isolation On Next-generation networks). Since 2013, he is Professor at ETH Zurich, leading the Network Security Group, whose research “revolves around building secure and robust network systems—with a particular focus on the design, development, and deployment of the SCION Internet architecture.\\". To commercialise the SCION technology, Adrian Perrig in 2017 founded the ETH Zurich spin-off Anapaya Systems together with Samuel Hitz and fellow professors at the Department of Computer Science David Basin and Peter Müller\\". == Main contributions == His work on TESLA, a protocol for broadcast stream authentication has been standardised by the IETFhttps://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4082.txt and ISO/IEC JTC 1,https://www.iso.org/standard/73905.html and is used by industry (e.g. Galileo SATNAVhttps://www.gpsworld.com/directions-2020-galileo-moves-ahead/) Perrig has worked on securing routing protocols in ad-hoc networks. The Ariadne, and Packet Leashes have had a lasting impact on the community. This work forms the basis for the ZigBee secure sensor communication standard and has had over 5000 citations. Starting in 2004, Perrig's research group has been studying hardware-based approaches leveraging the newly deployed TPM chip for trustworthy computing. The Flicker and TrustVisor systems (available open- source) were important early systems that guided attestation-based trusted computing research. With Bryan Parno and Jon McCune, Perrig published the introductory book Bootstrapping Trust in Modern Computers\\". Starting in 2003, his group proposed software-based attestation, also known as time-based attestation, a mechanism for performing attestation without special hardware support. Although initially met with resistance by the community, the systems stood the test of time (SWATT, PIONEER, SAKE, VIPER) and the research area was pursued by several research groups. Since 2013, Perrig and his Network Security group at ETH Zürich further develop and introduce new components to the SCION architecture. == Awards == * 2004: NSF CAREER Award * 2006: Sloan Research Fellowship * 2011: Benjamin Richard Teare teaching award * 2013: ACM SIGSAC Outstanding Innovation Award * 2017: ACM Fellow * 2020: IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy, won 4 test of time awards == References == == External links == * SCION Internet Architecture * Network Security Group ETH Zurich * Google Scholar Adrian Perrig * Anapaya Systems Category:1972 births Category:Living people Category:Carnegie Mellon University alumni Category:École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne alumni Category:ETH Zurich faculty Category:Swiss computer scientists Category:University of California, Berkeley alumni ","title":"Adrian Perrig"},{"id":"60395062","text":"Eric O'Sullivan (born 20 August 1998) is an Irish rugby union player, currently playing for Pro14 and European Rugby Champions Cup side Ulster.

He influenced and developed the theory on linear congruences and on the conic bilinear complexes. == Family life == Domenico was born in Potenza, Italy in 1863 to Leonardo Antonio Montesano and the duchess Isabella Schiavone of Aragona, Italy. They had nine children, five boys and four girls. Two of the sons became lawyers, two became medical doctors and Domenico studied mathematics. The daughters studied through to high school and learned music and painting. Domenico's brother, Giuseppe Ferruccio Montesano, became one of the founders of psychology and child psychiatry in Italy. == Education and career == Domenico was a disciple of Luigi Cremona and Giuseppe Battaglini and graduated in Rome in 1884; after a brief period of improvement and assistantship, in 1885, at the age of twenty-two, he became a professor of projective and descriptive geometry at the University of Bologna. In 1893, he became a full professor in the same chair at the University of Naples Federico II and later in 1895 to the teaching position in higher geometry. For many years he also held the chair of higher mathematics. In 1903 he was Dean of the Faculty of Mathematical Sciences. He was a member of the Royal Academy of Sciences of Naples, and in 1921 he became president of the Academy of Physical and Mathematical Sciences of Naples. He also served on the board of the Accademia Pontaniana and a member of the Palermo Mathematical Circle. He was honored as Commander of the Order of the Crown of Italy and Knight and Officer of the Order of Saints Maurice and Lazarus. He became a member of the Freemasons at a lodge in Bologna, during Cremona's term there as Venerable Master (and thus could personally conduct the initiation ceremonies of his protégé), with Giosuè Carducci as Secretary. He died in Naples on October 1, 1930. == Works == Togliatti surface, a quintic surface with 31 crunodes (the maximum possible) He made important contributions to the theory of Cremona transformations and handled the linear congruences and conical bilinear complexes. He discovered 30 new rational surfaces of the 5th order. He was the author of over fifty scholarly publications relating to Cremonian address geometry. Montesano's studies that mostly interested the international academic environment concerned the geometry of the straight line and the Cremonian transformations. Among his major works was a Treatise on Projective geometry. Some of his theories are still the object of interpretation and study by contemporary mathematicians. He also worked on fifth order algebraic surfaces, more commonly referred to as quintic surfaces. == Notes == * The Legacy of Mario Pieri in Geometry and Arithmetic * Gaetano Scorza, \\"Commemoration of the resident partner Domenico Montesano read by the corresponding member Gaetano Scorza\\", in Rendiconti of the Academy of Mathematical Sciences of Naples , 3rd Series, Naples, 1930. * Roberto Marcolongo, \\"In memory of Prof. Domenico Montesano\\", in Bulletin of the Italian Mathematical Union , Rome, 1931. * A.

Born in Loughborough, she was the sister of Honora Enfield. She attended Newnham College, Cambridge, and there joined the Fabian Society. While there, she met fellow student Emile Burns, and the two married on 8 November 1913. They had two children, Susannah and Marca. The family moved to London around the end of World War I, where Elinor and Emile joined the Independent Labour Party. Elinor also joined the Edmonton Co-operative Society and the Women's Co-operative Guild. In 1920, the Edmonton Co-operative became part of the new London Co-operative Society (LCS), of which she was a founder member. In 1923, Elinor joined the Communist Party of Great Britain (CPGB), along with Emile. Starting in 1926, she wrote the Colonial Series of books for the Labour Research Department, about British imperialism. Burns focused much of her time on the LCS, and during World War II represented it on bodies such as the Food Control Tribunal and the Insurance Tribunal. In 1943, she was elected to the national executive of the CPGB. She retained her seat on the board of the LCS when other Communists were removed from the organisation's panel of speakers in 1949. She argued that the co-operative movement should expand its influence through vertical integration, co-operative shops selling products of co-operative farms and factories. She also argued that, in order to achieve emancipation, women should involve themselves in the co-operative movement and also join the CPGB. From 1945, the Daily Worker, associated with the CPGB, was published by the People's Press Printing Society. Burns was a founding member of its management committee, and twice served as its vice-chair. In 1956, although Burns again stood for the executive of the CPGB, she was not put on the party's approved list, and was one of two sitting members to lose their seats. ==Writing== * \\"Franchise Reform.

Produced by the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) and broadcast across Europe via the Eurovision network, it is hosted by the European Parliament in Brussels, Belgium. The aim of the debate is to help public service media play their role in the democratic process by helping to better inform citizens and encouraging participation in the elections. ==History== The first Eurovision Debate took place on 15 May 2014 and was the first-ever live televised format to bring democratic political debate to a pan-European level. Italian journalist and Director of the Rai News24 moderated the debate with RTÉ's Conor McNally as its social media co- presenter. The Eurovision Debate is produced by the EBU under the guidance and the supervision of senior editors from European Public Service Media (the “Editorial Board”) and was directed by Rob Hopkin. The 2019 edition was broadcast live from the European Parliament in Brussels on 15 May 2019 at 21:00 CET, moderated by TV anchors (ARD/WDR), (France Télévisions) and (Yle) and broadcast by the EBU's public service media members and others throughout Europe. During the 90-minute debate, the following issues were to be addressed: migration, unemployment, security and climate change, and the role of Europe in the world. In fact, the debate was more about the common minimum wage, the European business tax, the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, the border control associated with solidarity, and the use of trade to improve working conditions in Europe. ==Format== The debate is presented by 2 television anchor personalities who ask the candidates on stage a series of questions on pre-determined themes, although the questions themselves are not known in advance. The debate obeys the strictest rules of transparency and neutrality, all candidates are allocated exactly the same speaking time. Interpretation is provided in almost all EU official languages. The order in which the candidates take the floor is decided by a draw which happens 5 weeks before the debate itself. The Eurovision Debate also uses social media to spark debate among citizens throughout Europe around issues that are topical for the European Parliament elections. A third anchor person is monitoring the exchanges online and reports to the journalists on stage so that the social media dimension is taken into account during the discussions. ==Candidates== Zahradil, Cué, Keller, Vestager, Timmermans, Weber. ===2014=== #Alexis Tsipras (Greece, European Left) #Ska Keller (Germany, European Green Party) #Martin Schulz (Germany, Party of European Socialists) #Jean-Claude Juncker (Luxembourg, European People’s Party) #Guy Verhofstadt (Belgium, Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe) ===2019=== The speaking order and the placing of the lead candidates were decided at the allocation draw held on 4 April. #Nico Cué (Spain, European Left) #Ska Keller (Germany, European Green Party) #Jan Zahradil (Czech Republic, Alliance of Conservatives and Reformists in Europe) #Margrethe Vestager (Denmark, Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe) #Manfred Weber (Germany, European People’s Party) #Frans Timmermans (Netherlands, Party of European Socialists) ==Broadcast== The debate is broadcast in more than 25 countries on TV, radio and online.

After attending school in Erfurt and Leipzig, he studied physics at the University of Leipzig, whose member he remained in the subsequent years, interrupted by guest stays in Prague, Leningrad, Moscow, Paris and Fredericton/Canada. His doctorate in 1970 with the dissertation \\"The diffusion of water at 13X zeolites: investigated by the method of nuclear magnetic resonance with the aid of pulsed field gradients\\" under the supervision of Harry Pfeifer was followed in 1978 by his doctorate B (1991 with conversion to habilitation) as well as the appointment to an extraordinary professorship in 1989 and a full professorship for experimental physics / interface physics in 1994. His scientific career was determined by his work on the use of NMR spectroscopy to measure molecular diffusion in nanoporous materials (zeolites), which he had already begun during his doctorate. After his measurements, existing ideas had to be corrected by orders of magnitude, which led to a paradigm shift in the understanding of molecular mass transport in such systems. The mechanism of two-range diffusion he applied became a widely used model for NMR diffusion measurements in complex systems, including their use for magnetic resonance imaging. His monographs Diffusion in Zeolites and Other Microporous Solids (Wiley, 1992, together with D. M. Ruthven)see Books and Diffusion in Nanoporous Materials (together with D. M. Ruthven and D. N. Theodorou) became core literature in sorption research, i.e. in the investigation of the behavior of molecules in interaction with interfaces. His work was recognized with the award of the Gustav Hertz Prize of the GDR Physical Society (1978, together with Harry Pfeifer), the Breck Award of the International Zeolite Association (1986, together with Harry Pfeifer, Dieter Freude and Martin Bülow) and the Max Planck Research Award (1993, together with Douglas M. Ruthven). He is the author of over 500 papers in periodicals, author/editor of 10 books. Together with Paul Heitjans, he initiated the Diffusion Fundamentals conference series, which is devoted to the phenomena of random movement and propagation in their entirety. The objects considered can thus be of a material or immaterial nature and range from atoms and molecules as the traditional objects of diffusion research to new species in the animal and plant world and new words in our vocabulary. Since the 6th conference 2015 in Dresden the conference series with the accompanying Diffusion-Fundamentals-Online-Journal has been under the auspices of the Saxon Academy of Sciences and Humanities in Leipzig. The Dresden conference gave rise to the edition of a book on \\"Diffusive Spreading in Nature, Technology and Society\\", for which he, together with Armin Bunde, Jürgen Caro and Gero Vogl, was awarded the Literature Prize of the Fonds der Chemischen Industrie in 2019.

Warner Bros., who have held the rights to a live- action version of Akira since 2002, have repeatedly struggled to get production off the ground over various concerns. Most recently, the film was to be directed by Taika Waititi, with production to start in July 2019, and scheduled for theatrical release on May 21, 2021. However, just prior to production, Waititi put the project on hold to direct Thor: Love and Thunder for Marvel Studios. ==Production== ===Film rights and conception=== Akira is considered one of the most influential manga works, and had already been developed into a 1988 anime film Akira, itself a critically acclaimed film. In the 1990s, Sony Pictures obtained the rights to the property with the intent of creating a live-action adaptation. The project was ultimately cancelled due to budgetary concerns. In 2002, Warner Bros. acquired the rights to create a live-action remake of Akira as a seven-figure deal.Linder, Brian et al. (12 April 2002). \\"Akira Hollywood Remake!?\\" IGN.com. Retrieved 24 October 2006. However, the project has undergone several failed attempts to produce it, and is frequently considered to have been in development hell. Over the course of its troubled development, at least five different directors and ten different writers have been attached. The directors reportedly had some freedom with the project; according to writer Gary Whitta, who had written an early draft of the screenplay, they were told that Otomo had instructed those working on the film \\"basically to not be afraid to change things, that he wanted to see an original and different interpretation, not just a straight-up remake\\". In a June 2017 interview, Otomo said that he was \\"basically done with Akira\\" as a manga, and that \\"if someone wants to do something new with Akira then I am mostly okay with that\\", on the condition that he be allowed to review and approve of any approach a writer might take with a live-action adaptation. IGN concluded that long-term troubles with producing the live-action film primarily came from two areas. Firstly, there has been the fear of whitewashing or racebending, casting American or other Western actors in lieu of Japanese ones, which has frequently come to light when such actors have been reported as under consideration for these roles. Secondly, Akira itself is not considered a story that is easy to relocate outside of Japan, due to the heavy influence on the original story of Japan's role in World War II, including the atomic bombings of Japan, and their own Unit 731. Attempts to make it more Westernized in order to draw American audiences, such as using the September 11 attacks as part of the establishing events instead of the atomic bombings, required fundamental changes to the story, which has subsequently drawn much criticism. Shortly after Warner Bros. acquired the rights, Stephen Norrington was slated to direct with James Robinson writing the screenplay and Dan Lin producing. Norrington had planned to make his adaptation more appealing to Western audiences. His version also would have made Kaneda and Tetsuo brothers. However, following the commercial failure of The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen in 2003 (which both Norrington and Robinson also collaborated on), the project was put on hold. Director Ruairi Robinson announced in 2008 he was teaming with Whitta to adapt the manga for live-action, with the plan to split it into two films, with the first to be completed and released by 2009. Producer Andrew Lazar said that the first film would cover volumes 1 through 3 of the manga, with the rest covered in the second film. Whitta, in a 2015 interview, said that the story would have taken place in a futuristic Japan-owned Manhattan, renaming the region to New Tokyo. This would have allowed them to have used a mixture of Western and Asian cultures and actors so as to avoid concerns that they would be whitewashing the project. Robinson left the project in 2009 and was replaced by directors Allen and Albert Hughes, though later Allen would drop out in 2011. They used Whitta's script, with additional rewrites by Mark Fergus and Hawk Ostby, with plans to aim for a PG-13 rating. Around 2011, a version of the Akira script leaked online; though it was unclear if it was Whitta's or Fergus/Ostby's draft, the scripts were criticized for deviating significantly from the source material in several ways, according to IGN, such as making Akira a \\"psychotic murderous creepy child\\", the inclusion of heavy-handed references to the September 11 attacks, and characters written in a misogynistic fashion. Around this same time, casting calls for the film led to accusations of whitewashing. Shortly after these events, Hughes left the project, citing \\"amicable creative differences\\". In July 2011, Jaume Collet-Serra was hired to direct, with Steve Kloves providing revision work on a draft by screenwriter Albert Torres.Warner Bros. taps ‘Unknown’ director for ‘Akira’ The film was greenlit in October 2011, with filming eyed to begin by February or March 2012.Warners greenlights ‘Akira’; Hedlund front-runner In January 2012, as production was gearing up to begin in Vancouver, Warner Bros. halted production, citing issues with casting, the script and the budget.'Akira' Production Offices Shut Down As Warner Bros.

After Collett-Serra once again exited the project, Warner Bros. offered George Miller the chance to direct the film, but he turned it down due to commitments to other projects. The studio was also reported to have been in talks with Justin Lin to direct the film. Jordan Peele was offered the chance to direct, but declined. In September 2017, it was announced that director Taika Waititi was in talks to direct. He asserted his intention to cast Asian-American teenagers to play the leads to avoid concerns over whitewashing, and preferred lesser-known actors for the roles. He also intended to adapt the original six-volume manga rather than directly adapting the anime film. In May 2019, Waititi was officially confirmed to direct the film, and would be co-writing the script with Michael Golamco, with a release date of May 21, 2021. Filming was scheduled to have commenced in California in July 2019. However, when it was announced that Waititi would direct Thor: Love and Thunder, he dropped out of Akira, once again putting the project on hold. Waititi said to IGN in October 2019 that he is still committed to Akira once his commitment on Thor is complete. Warner Bros. ultimately removed Akira from its release schedule by December 2019, replacing the May 2021 date with The Matrix 4. In an interview in February 2020, Waititi said that Thor had caused Akira to be pushed out at least two years, and he was not sure if he would still be involved. === Casting === Several actors have been considered for principle roles throughout the development of the project. By May 2011, Andrew Garfield, Robert Pattinson and Michael Fassbender were met with for the role of Tetsuo, while Garrett Hedlund, Fassbender, Chris Pine, Justin Timberlake and Joaquin Phoenix were being considered for the role of Kaneda. Keanu Reeves was also being courted to star.Keanu Reeves Circling Warner Bros.'

Teruko was a woman trained in ko- naginata, fought in many battles when younger and commanded three thousand soldiers in Kanayama castle at 70 years old. She was the daughter of Akai Terumitsu, spouse of Yura Shigeru the retainer of Hōjō clan, and grandmother of Kaihime. In contrast to her famous granddaughter, Kaihime, who was known as \\"The most beautiful woman in east Japan\\" (東国無双の美人), Teruko was known as The strongest woman in the Warring States Period (戦国時代最強の女丈夫). == Early Life == Teruko was born as the daughter of Tatebayashi Castle lord Akai Terumitsu. According to legend, Teruko's father saved a young fox from naughty children, and then in the evening an Inari appeared and recommended a location for his castle, drawing a design for the fortifications on the ground by its tail. The castle that Teruko lived during her early life was the target of constant threats from the Uesugi, Takeda and Later Hōjō clans. There are no details about Teruko's life with her father, but it is likely that she was trained in military skills from the early age. == Arrival to the Yura clan == Terumitsu proposed a political marriage between Teruko and Yura Shigeru, the head of the Yura clan and lord of Kanayama castle in currently Gunma Prefecture. During the marriage to Shigeru, she gave birth to Yura Kunishige and Nagao Akinaga. She had a daughter who married the lord of Oshi castle, Narita Ujinaga, during the wedding Teruko's daughter gave birth to Kaihime. Teruko's husband, Shigeru, was a warlord who played independence as a Sengoku feudal lord, and switched forces in front of the powerful forces Uesugi and Hojo. The Yura family has been a role of intermediary between the Echiso Alliance, which is the alliance between Uesugi and Hojo. In 1578, Shigeru died of illness, so his son Kunishige took over the leadership of the clan. After her husband's death, Teruko becomes a Buddhist nun by changing her name to Myoin-ni (妙印尼). Because Kunishige proved unable to lead the clan, Myoin-ni (Teruko) acquired substantial political power and acted actively in the administration of her family's domain. == Struggles with Hojo clan == Kanayama castle When Hōjō clan suddenly exhibited hostility against Yura clan in 1584, Yura Kunishige and his brother Nagao Akinaga were captured by the Hōjō of Odawara. The Hōjō's troops marched to took Kanayama castle.

She sided with Toyotomi clan and turn to the retainer of Maeda Toshie with her grandson, Yura Sadashige. Together with Toshiie, Teruko took part in the Siege of Matsuida castle. Teruko was greatly admired by Hideyoshi and Toshiie for their heroic deeds as a warrior. Hideyoshi gave her as a reward the territory of 5435 koku in Ushiku and became the owner of Ushiku Castle, but soon she transferred the property to Kunishige. == Later life == Teruko died in 1594 and was buried in Togetsu-in in Ushiku, Ibaraki Prefecture.

He retained this position until his death on 27 January 1947. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1907. His proposers were George Chrystal, Arthur John Pressland, John Sturgeon Mackay and John Alison. In 1918 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of South Africa. ==Personal life== He married Mary Graham in 1911 and they had a daughter and a son. In his leisure time he was a great reader and a keen musician. ==Works== He contributed to the study of the ratio of incommensurables in geometry and relations between the distances of a point from three vertices of a regular polygon. His paper on this subject was read before the Edinburgh Mathematical Society on 11 June 1909. ==Selected publications== *Brown, A.

Discovered by members of an 1855 expedition tasked with drilling artesian wells east of the Pecos led by U.S. Army topographical engineer John Pope, the ford quickly became the primary crossing of the river on the \\"upper\\" military or emigrant road between San Antonio and the ford on the Rio Grande opposite the Mexican town of El Paso del Norte. Heavily used by emigrants, soldiers, traders, and freighters eager to avoid the more difficult and unpredictable crossings further south, Pope's Crossing became a well-traveled part of the network of transcontinental wagon roads that developed across Texas in the 1850s to facilitate settlement and commerce in the southwestern lands recently acquired as a result of the Mexican–American War. The ford on the Pecos chosen by the Butterfield Overland Mail line and, later, by the Goodnight–Loving cattle trail, Pope's Crossing would also play a significant role in the development of transportation, communication, and economic infrastructure in the Trans- Pecos region of Texas. Rendered impractical by the coming of the railroads in 1880, the crossing, and the associated camp Pope established nearby, would be inundated by the waters of Red Bluff Reservoir, created when the Pecos was impounded by the construction of the Red Bluff Dam in 1936. ==History== In the early 1850s the United State Congress, eager to secure permanent links with the 525,000 square miles of southwestern territory acquired by the United States as a result of the Mexican–American War, dispatched a number of expeditions into these lands to survey possible routes for a transcontinental rail line from the Mississippi river to the Pacific coast.Bender, A. B. \\"Opening Routes across West Texas, 1848–1850.\\" The Southwestern Historical Quarterly 37, no. 2 (1933): 116–135. http://www.jstor.org/stable/30240524. The expedition tasked with surveying a southern route across Texas from the Rio Grande to the Red River was entrusted to Brevet Captain John Pope, an Army topographical engineer in the Department of New Mexico. Assembling a group of approximately 75 officers, scientific specialists, teamsters and escort troops at Mesilla, a town on the Rio Grande near modern Las Cruces, New Mexico, Pope began to move east in February 1853. Traveling past the Guadalupe Mountains, Pope crossed the Pecos River near the modern Texas-New Mexico border and continued east across the Llano Estacado and the Cross Timbers, reaching the Red River near Preston on May 16.United States.

Pope's report, submitted to Congress in late 1854, lauded the proposed southern route, describing it as \\"a route for emigration or for military purposes ... from the frontiers of Arkansas to the valley of the Rio Grande, which, for more than half the entire distance, traverses a region fertile, well watered, well timbered, and of mild climate.\\" The only major problem with constructing a railroad along the route, the report conceded, was the area between the Pecos River and the headwaters of the Colorado River, a difficult part of the Llano Estacado that contained very little water or wood. A possible solution, Pope argued, was to drill a series of artesian wells east of the Pecos to provide permanent supplies of water for emigrants and railroads, his report concluding that \\"the peculiarly favorable character of the ground along the route of the 32d parallel, the directness of this route over it, and the difficulties [of potential routes] to the north and south, would seem to present inducements eminently favorable to the construction of these wells.\\"United States.

Made Under the Direction of the Secretary of War, In 1853-[6] … Washington: A.O.P. Nicholson, printer [etc.], 185560. Congress agreed, and in 1855 Pope was ordered to return to the Pecos for the purpose of seeking underground sources of water, the first Anglo attempt to drill for resources in the Trans-Pecos region. Leaving the port of Indianola, on the Texas gulf coast, Pope traveled to the Pecos, establishing a camp on the eastern bank of the river approximately 4 miles south of the modern Texas–New Mexico border. Near the end of the almost three year attempt to find water, one of the many small parties of exploration dispatched by Pope to map the local area and catalog local flora and fauna discovered a previously unknown ford across the Pecos north of Pope's camp. Seemingly undiscovered by any of the several expeditions that had previously crossed the area, or by emigrant trains, or even by Pope himself, who had crossed the Pecos further north at the confluence with Delaware Creek during his expedition of 1854, the unnamed ford was noted on a June 1858 map prepared by Pope as being \\"three miles north- northwest of his 'Main Camp,' and one mile south of the New Mexico line.\\"Patrick Dearen. Crossing Rio Pecos. Fort Worth: TCU Press, 2012. https://muse.jhu.edu/ (accessed March 17, 2019). Located on a portion of the river with broader, shallower approaches than the traditional crossing point at Horsehead Crossing further south (between modern Crane and McCamey), the ford that would eventually bear Pope's name quickly gained popularity among the emigrants, gold-seekers, traders, and freighters who traveled the \\"upper\\" road between San Antonio and the crossing of the Rio Grande opposite the Mexican town of El Paso del Norte (modern day El Paso, Texas). Eager to avoid the difficult and unpredictable crossing further south, traffic increasingly bypassed the ford at Horsehead Crossing, continuing north along the eastern side of the river before crossing the river at Pope's ford and emerging on the western bank near the established road that ran south of the Guadalupe Mountains to the Rio Grande.Patrick Dearen. Crossing Rio Pecos. Fort Worth: TCU Press, 2012. https://muse.jhu.edu/ (accessed March 17, 2019). In addition to providing a new link in the growing network of transcontinental roads, the discovery of the new crossing also supported the development of private transportation systems, like stagecoach lines, and public services, such as the mail. The Butterfield Overland Mail, an ambitious attempt to offer regular passenger and mail stagecoach service between San Francisco, California and St. Louis, Missouri, a distance of 2,795 miles, used Pope's Crossing to ford the Pecos, and Pope's Camp, the nearby depot used during the 1855 drilling expedition, as a line station, before turning northeast towards the Red River. This would continue for eleven months, until August 1859, when company officials moved the official route south to take advantage of the protection offered by Forts Davis and Stockton. Though short-lived, the mail route would help establish Pope's Crossing as not only a major component of the road from San Antonio, but also a part of the increasingly popular trail across north Texas to the Red River and the population centers beyond.Williams, J. W. \\"The Butterfield Overland Mail Road across Texas.\\" The Southwestern Historical Quarterly 61, no. 1 (1957): 1–19. http://www.jstor.org/stable/30240787. Pope's Crossing would also play an important role in the development of the cattle trails used to transport cattle from Texas to markets outside the state. Responding to a desperate need for beef in New Mexico, where the requirements of settlers and soldiers had been exponentially compounded by the needs of thousands of Native Americans recently moved onto ill-prepared and ill- supplied reservations, two cattlemen from north Texas, Charles Goodnight and Oliver Loving, undertook to drive 2,000 head of cattle from Fort Belknap (near modern Newcastle, Texas) to Fort Sumner, a military post on the Pecos river west of modern Clovis.https://www.legendsofamerica.com/we-goodnight- lovingtrail/ Beginning the approximately 700-mile journey in June 1866, the drive initially following the route established by the Butterfield Overland Mail between north Texas and the Horsehead Crossing of the Pecos. Avoiding the difficult crossing, Goodnight and Loving instead turned north and drove their herd up the eastern bank of the river, fording the river at Pope's Crossing.https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/ayg02 Though this required them to re-cross the river later on, the use of Pope's Crossing allowed the drive to avoid the eastern bank of the river from the state line to north of Carlsbad, which was largely composed of sandhills, unsuitable for use as a trail.Patrick Dearen. Crossing Rio Pecos. Fort Worth: TCU Press, 2012. https://muse.jhu.edu/ (accessed March 17, 2019). Successfully arriving at Fort Sumner, Goodnight and Loving established a route that would, despite Loving's death the next year on a subsequent drive, lead to the driving of thousands of heads of cattle across Pope's ford along a trail that eventually stretched into Colorado and Wyoming. ==Inundation== Though located and popularized as part of a larger effort to forge permanent rail links through the region, the importance of Pope's Crossing steadily declined after the arrival of the Texas and Pacific Railroad in 1880. The consistent, all-weather capabilities of rail began to render the long, slow, hot, wagon road, and its crossing, increasingly irrelevant. The arrival of the railroad also led to a gradual increase in the population of the region, who, having chosen to settle in the region, began to see the Pecos less as a barrier to be overcome, and more as a valuable resource to be managed, the waters of the river recognized as a prerequisite to permanent settlement and a vital element in any attempt to create an agricultural region along the valley of the river. By the turn of the century counties on both sides of the Texas–New Mexico border had begun to examine different methods by which the waters of the Pecos could be used to support both the needs of a growing population and the requirements of large- scale agriculture. One plan eventually adopted was the impoundment of the Pecos below the Texas–New Mexico state line and the creation of a reservoir to provide municipal water supplies to settlers in Reeves and Loving counties. First envisioned in 1916, when the Pecos Valley of Texas Water Users Association enlisted the aid of the Department of the Interior in the planning and construction of a reservoir, the plan would eventually be approved by President Calvin Coolidge in 1926, after the completion of a compact between the states of Texas and New Mexico (later repealed by both states).Marilyn C. O'Leary, \\"Texas v. New Mexico: The Pecos River Compact Litigation,\\" Natural Resources Journal, Spring 1980. Established in 1927, the controlling authority for the project, the Red Bluff Water Power Control District, began construction of the Red Bluff Dam, a 9,200 foot long earthen embankment, in November 1934, completing the project 22 months later, in September 1936. A very wet 1937 quickly filled the resulting reservoir with 151,110 acre-feet of water, flooding a surface area of 7,495 acres, including Pope's Crossing and Pope's Camp. http://www.twdb.texas.gov/surfacewater/rivers/reservoirs/red_bluff/index.asp ==Access== As previously noted, the exact location of Pope's Crossing, and the associated camp, was inundated in 1936 by the waters of Red Bluff Lake, a reservoir created by the impoundment of the Pecos by the Red Bluff Dam.

The organisation originated as the Halifax branch of the Labour Electoral Association (LEA), formed in mid-1891. It received the support of much of the Halifax Trades Council, which had itself been founded in 1889, and had an initial aim of getting a trade unionist adopted as one of the two Liberal Party candidates for vacancies on the Halifax School Board, but the request was ignored. In November, James Beever, leader of the LEA, was invited to stand as the liberal candidate for the Southowram ward in a council by- election, which was expected to be uncontested. However, other Liberal Party members disagreed with Beever's advocacy of Liberal-Labour candidates, and stood H. E. Greenwood as a rival. Beever decided to stand for the seat as an independent labour candidate, although he was not elected.Patricia A. Dawson, \\"The Halifax Independent Labour Movement: Labour and Liberalism 1890-1914\\". In: Keith Laybourn and David James (1991), The Rising Sun of Socialism, Hertford: Stephen Austin & Sons. pp.45-74 Now focused on standing independently, in January 1892, the LEA stood two of its own candidates for the school board: James Tattersall and Albert Thornton. They campaigned for free education and fair wages for school staff, and took the top two places in the poll, winning seats on the board. In April and July, Beever and Tattersall were both sacked by Clayton, Murgatroyd and Company, an action generally thought to be in retaliation for their labour activism. Large public meetings were held in support of the two, and a May Day demonstration attracted 10,000 people. The LEA launched the Halifax Labour Union, with a remit to take on the political work of the trades council, and promote independent labour candidates. The Labour Union also won the support of the Halifax Fabian Society, which had been founded in 1891. In November 1892, Halifax Town Council was redistricted, leading to all-out elections, and the Labour Union stood six candidates on a platform of building council housing and including fair pay and conditions requirements in council contracts. Beever was elected in Southowram, John Lister in Central, and Thomas Davenport in Pellon, and this representation enabled them to vote Tattersall in as an alderman. Lister, a wealthy barrister, served as treasurer of the Labour Union, and loaned it substantial amounts. A Parliamentary by-election arose in Halifax early in 1893, and the party decided to stand Lister, on the grounds that he could afford to pay the substantial expenses. They hoped that he might be adopted by the Liberal Party, but William Rawson Shaw was chosen instead, and Lister fought as a Labour Union candidate. He took 25.4% of the vote, but only third place. The campaign further increased support for the organisation, with membership of more than 600 people, and it was able to launch a weekly newspaper, the Labour News. The Halifax Labour Union was represented at the founding conference of the Independent Labour Party (ILP), in 1893, and it affiliated to the new national party. Throughout the 1890s, it was the ILP's second largest branch, behind only the Bradford Labour Union. It lost its council seats, although some results were close, such as James Parker's 1893 contest in Central ward. It again won one in 1897, increasing this to six by 1903, and seven plus two aldermen by 1913. Lister contested the Parliamentary seat again in the 1895 UK general election, then Tom Mann stood in the 1897 Halifax by-election. ==References== Category:Independent Labour Party Category:Labour parties Category:Political parties established in 1892 Category:Halifax, West Yorkshire ","title":"Halifax Labour Union"},{"id":"60395648","text":"Anodonthyla eximia is a species of frog from Ranomafana in Eastern Madagascar endemic microhylid subfamily Cophylinae.

It was set up from the beginning as a contact point between the German Celtologists and the Schutzstaffel. Immediately after its founding, SS-Obergruppenführer Werner Best and Ahnenerbe became cooperative members. Best was at this time de facto Interior Minister of France and German national propaganda. In addition, the work of the Institute has been dressed up ideologically: It was said in reports from the Reich, \\"to supplement the old, merely linguistically oriented research with racial and folkloric research\\". Important founding members were Helmut Bauersfeld, , Hans Otto Wagner, Adolf Mahr, and Helmut Clissmann.For the early connections of these scientists to the Abwehr and Sicherheitsdienst des Reichsführers SS (SD) see After the start of World War II some members of the DGKS were assigned special tasks in the Abwehr and the Foreign Office, particularly in the Benelux countries, and in northern France.

Mühlhausen from the beginning of 1940 also worked with Leo Weisgerber for foreign broadcasting propaganda. At a Celtic congress in Wernigerode at the beginning of September 1941, Mühlhausen spoke in favor of the continuation and \\"use of humanities in war\\". In June 1942, Mühlhausen was leader of an \\"education and research center for Celtic people research\\" newly established in the Ahnenerbe. While working in collaboration with the SS-Ahnenerbe the DGKS was involved in espionage, as well as sabotage and encouraging Celtic ethnic minorities towards insurrection in Brittany and the British Isles, like Ireland and the Isle of Man. ==See also== * * Olier Mordrel * François Debeauvais * Frank-Rutger Hausmann * ==References== ==Bibliography== * Joachim Lerchenmueller: \\"Keltischer Sprengstoff\\" : eine wissenschaftsgeschichtliche Studie über die deutsche Keltologie von 1900 bis 1945.

In arthropods, it contains the pars intercerebralis and pars lateralis. six3 is associated with the euarthropod labrumPosnien, N., Koniszewski, N.D.B., Hein, H.J. and Bucher, G. 2011: Candidate gene screen in the red flour beetle tribolium reveals six3 as ancient regulator of anterior median head and central complex development.

This region is more caudal and lateral, and bears the eyes. Orthodenticle is associated with the protocerebral bridge, part of the central complex, traditionally a marker of the prosocerebrum. In the annelid brain, Otx expression characterises the peristomium, but also creeps forwards into the regions of the prostomium that bear the larval eyes. == Names of regions == Inconsistent use of the terms archicerebrum and the prosocerebrum makes them confusing. The regions were defined by Siewing (1963): the archicerebrum as containing the ocular lobes and the mushroom bodies (= corpora pedunculata), and the prosocerebrum as comprising the central complex. The archicerebrum has traditionally been equated with the anteriormost, 'non-segmental' part of the protocerebrum, equivalent to the acron in older terminology. The prosocerebrum is then equivalent to the 'segmental' part of the protocerebrum, bordered by segment polarity genes such as engrailed, and (on one interpretation) bearing modified segmental appendages (= camera-type eyes). But Urbach and Technau (2003) complicate the matter by seeing the prosocerebrum (central complex) + labrum as the anteriormost region * Strausfeld 2016 identifies the anteriormost part of the brain = labrum = acron with the archicerebrum, followed by an engrailed- bounded 'first segment', bearing appendicular eyes, termed the prosocerebrum. * Ortega-Hernández et al. (2017) follow the same model as Strausfeld (2016), but switch the terms prosocerebrum and archicerebrum. * Archicerebrum = acron, followed by 'labral segment' / 'first head segment': * Urbach & Technau say that the archicerebrum = acron = ocular segment = first three protocerebral lobes bears optic lobes and mushroom bodies, and lacks engrailed; the prosocerebrum = fourth protocerebral lobe includes \\"the central complex and the neurosecretory cells of the pars intercerebralis\\" and corresponds to the labral segment. * Weygoldt (1985) Weygoldt, Peter. \\"Ontogeny of the arachnid central nervous system.\\" Neurobiology of arachnids.

Dowek also was a founder of the Association of Visual Artists of the Republic of Argentina (AVARA), now labeled a Vice President. == Biography == Diana Dowek was born in Buenos Aires, Argentina on January 1, 1942. She has been labeled a Postwar and Contemporary Artist. It is worth mentioning that in 1975, Dowek experienced a huge change in her life; the coup that overturned the Argentinian President. Some sources do, however, note that this event as well as the Vietnam war is what led Diana Dowek to her activist movements, seeing as she experienced so much terrorism. In 1964, Diana Dowek would settle down and marry her husband before moving to Italy. While they did enjoy the life they lived out in the country, it only took a year before they felt homesick, thus packing up once again and returning to Argentina. From that point on, they would stay in Argentina ever since. Diana Dowek would go through some turning point events, such as a coup d'etat that was planned in order to overthrow the President Isabel Peron, leaving the government to be led by a military junta. Due to this horrific event, Argentina would mark this time period as \\"Argentina's Dirty War\\"; a period that included terrorism and socialistic riots. This event could be compared to the predecessor, French Reign of Terror period, since similar in some events. This \\"Dirty War\\" had ended with 30,000 people disappearing by the year 1983. == Education == Sources indicate that Diana Dowek first entered Escuela de Bellas Artes Manuel Belgrano in Buenos Aires (roughly translated to the Manuel Belgrano School of Fine Arts) at the ripe age of thirteen before she later enrolled in a similar school, Escuela Nacional de Bellas Artes Prilidiano Pueyrredón (National Fine Arts). Both schools were within her general vicinity of Buenos Aires. While in attendance at Escuela Nacional de Bellas Artes Prilidiano Pueyrredón, Dowek demanded educational reform alongside other members of the student movement, protesting the active militance opposition so many of her colleagues were up against. During these years, she would make connections and build what could be described as friendships with other important figures, such as Horacion Safons and Margarita Paska, eventually forming an \\"active cohort among Buenos Aires' artistic avant-gardes\\" in other words being, they would form a power group. == Activism == During her time in school, Diana Dowek's early work all portrayed her political stance, and most importantly her attempts at raising awareness of social issues and struggles during President Isabel Peron's reign. Dowek was known to have a unique style that led to a number of metaphors being iterated, resulting in over fifty paintings that would document urban uprisings. One of the most known paintings that conveyed these terroristic events would be Paisaje con retrovisor II. Dowek was engaged in a Post-War movement, promoting human rights and raising awareness. It is known that Ford Falcon cars became a common subject in her painting due to the disappearance of persons in 1983, owed to police often abducting people with unlicensed Falcons. == Artworks == === Painting === Diana Dowek ==== Paisaje con retrovisor II, 1975 ==== Also known as (Landscape with side view mirror II), this painting is part of a miniseries that became an addition to the Collection of Dr. José Abadi. In an LA Times article, this piece was denoted as one of the most startling works in the exhibit, which can be owed to the still bodies in the car's rearview mirror. The world within this painting seems to be dystopic, and with further investigation, it is revealed that this painting was owed to the coup d'etat that has earlier changed life for the visual artists Diana Dowek. == Exhibitions == -1968 Galeria Lirolay, Bueno Aires -1985 Pintado en Argentina, Museo Eduardo Sivori, Centro Cultural de Buenos Aires -1996 Zana Catástrofe: El poder vulnerable, Fundación Federico Klemm, Buenos Aires -2001 Diana Dowek: Exposición retrospectiva, 1972, Museo Nacional de Bellas Artes, Buenos Aires -2003 Ansia y Devoción.

It has alternately arranged, seated, flat to slightly succulent, broad-based, entire, blunt tipped leaves. The flower heads sit individually on top of a stalk of up to long, have an involucre of three whorls of bracts, many yellow ray florets and many yellow disk florets. It can be found in southern Africa, in Zimbabwe, Mozambique, Botswana, Swaziland, South Africa and on the coast of Angola. == Taxonomy == The yellow felicia was first described by William Philip Hiern in 1898, based on a collection made by the Austrian explorer and botanist Friedrich Welwitsch in 1859, between the town of Moçâmedes and the river Giraul in Angola. Hiern called it Detris mossamedensis. In the same publication, he also described a new variety of Detris hyssopifolia, that he named straminea, based on another 1859 collection by Welwitsch, now from Praja de Amelia near Moçâmedes. A specimen from near Amatikulu in Zululand, South Africa, collected by James Wylie in 1899, was described by Nicholas Edward Brown in 1901 as Felicia lutea. John Hutchington reassigned Brown's species to the genus Aster, creating the combination A. luteus in 1935. In 1943, Francisco de Ascensão Mendonça reassigned Detris mossamedensis to the genus Felicia, making the combination F. mossamedensis. Jürke Grau in his 1973 Revision of the genus Felicia, considered all these names synonyms. The species is considered to be part of the section Felicia. The species name mossamedensis refers to the type location, the Moçâmedes District in Angola. It is called kgaba yaMatebele in the Tswana language. == Description == The yellow felicia is a roughly hairy, annual or perennial plant of high, with a tough taproot that strongly branches from the foot, and is also often woody at the base. Its leaves are arranged alternately along the stems, lack a leaf stalk, have a single vein, a wide base, an entire margin and a blunt tip, are narrowly inverted lance-shaped to line-shaped in outline, 1–3 cm (0.5–1.4 in) long and 0.8–6 mm (0.03–0.24 in) wide. They are flat to slightly succulent, with perpendicular, broad-based bristles and often glandular. The flower heads sit individually at the tip of an up to long inflorescence stalks, which are bristly and often glandular in its lower parts and eventually hairless near the top, and with some small scaly bracts. The greenish involucre that envelops the florets is up to in diameter, and consists of three whorls of overlapping bracts that are lance-shaped. The bracts in the outer whorl are bristly and glandular, about long and mm (0.02 in) wide. The bracts in the middle whorl eventually become hairless, are about 5 mm (0.22 in) long and wide. The bracts in the innermost whorl are hairless to begin with, about 5 mm long and mm (0.02 in) wide. Along the margin of the flower head are many female ray florets that have yellow straps of about long and wide radiating out. In the center of the head are many yellow, bisexual disc florets of about long. In the center of the corolla of each disc floret are five anthers merged into a tube, through which the style grows when the floret opens, hoovering up the pollen on its shaft. The style in both ray- and disc florets forks, and at the tip of both style branches is a triangular appendage. Surrounding the base of the corolla are many white, deciduous pappus bristles of about long, that are strongly serrated near the base and weakly near the top. The eventually black, dry, one-seeded, indehiscent fruits called cypsellae are inverted egg- shaped, about long and wide, with a prominent, light-coloured ridge along the margin, and with some scattered hairs along its surface. It is a diploid with nine homologous pairs of chromosomes (2n=18). === Differences with related species === There are only few Felicia species with yellow ray florets. F. mossamedensis has alternately set, entire leaves, and a single medium-size flower head with an involucre of three whorls of bracts, at the tip of the inflorescence stalk. All other species with yellow ray florets have oppositely set leaves lower and alternately set leaves nearer the top, with entire or toothed margins. In all other species with yellow ray florets, the stems carry many, small heads, each surrounded by an involucre of four worls of bracts. == Distribution, habitat and conservation == F. mossamedensis occurs in western, central, southern, and eastern Zimbabwe, the Manica e Sofala, Gaza-Imhambane and Maputo provinces of Mozambique, Botswana, Swaziland, and the Limpopo, Gauteng, Mpumalanga and KwaZulu-Natal provinces of South Africa. There also is an isolated population in a narrow strip along the coast of Angola near Moçâmedes. Grau suggested that the species might have lifted a hike on a ship from Mozambique to Angola, both of which being former Portuguese colonies. In Zimbabwe it grows in shrubland, grassland and along roadsides up to an altitude of up to . In South Africa, it is considered a least concern species. == References == == External links == * photos on iNaturalist * line drawing * distribution map mossamedensis Category:Flora of Southern Africa Category:Flora of South Tropical Africa Category:Plants described in 1898 ","title":"Felicia mossamedensis"},{"id":"60396053","text":"Burschville School, also known as District No. 107 School, is a one-room schoolhouse near Corcoran, Minnesota, United States.

It was published on 7 November 2017 by The Bodley Head, a subdivision of Random House. The book follows the stages in Brown's personal and political life, from his upbringing in Scotland to his tenures as Chancellor of the Exchequer and Prime Minister, with his own behind-the-scenes account of the global financial crisis. == Publication == Brown's much- anticipated memoir was published on 7 November 2017. In a Waterstones interview a few days after its launch, journalist Robert Peston put forward the idea that Gordon Brown was in many ways an underrated politician and an underrated Chancellor. Brown was subsequently approached by Waterstones and interviewed, where he explained how he had chosen the right time to write his memoir; \\"I think this is the right time, seven years on, to explain what you've been doing, how you saw the events at the time, what lessons you learnt and how the past shapes our future.\\" Revelations in the post-release interview included Brown's admiration for Nelson Mandela's autobiography Long Walk to Freedom, and his initial career plan to become a footballer rather than an MP. My Life, Our Time was reprinted by Vintage Books on 24 May 2018. On 3 June, Brown attended an event at Cardiff City Stadium to discuss the book, with Kevin Brennan MP. == Reception == My Life, Our Times received mixed reviews from critics. Writing in The Guardian, political journalist and specialist on New Labour, Andrew Rawnsley, noted the memoir's most riveting moments concerned the financial crash; \\"the most valuable chapters here are those that describe how they averted a total implosion of the banking system\\". The paper praised Brown, saying he was \\"Miles ahead of anyone you can name currently in office at Westminster. Brown thinks, and thinks profoundly. And by and large, over the last 30 years, what he has thought has turned out to be correct.\\" They went on to say the memoir was \\"thrilling\\" and \\"unexpectedly moving\\". The Financial Times summarised the book by saying \\"the former Labour Prime Minister resisted the usual pressures to produce an instant memoir. To the frustration of the casual reader (and perhaps the publisher) he resists the temptation to engage in much gossip either. What Brown does provide is some score-settling, more self-criticism than one might expect, and a sense of deep frustration that his long wait to become prime minister ended with him struggling to cope with the job and seeing his economic legacy come crashing down.\\" Labour MP Peter Mandelson reviewed the memoir in the Evening Standard, also praising Brown's book. == See also == * A Journey, the political memoir of Tony Blair, the first Prime Minister under New Labour. == References == == External links == * My Life Our Times Archives - The Office of Gordon and Sarah Brown Category:2017 non-fiction books Category:Political memoirs Category:Gordon Brown Category:Random House books Category:The Bodley Head books Category:British memoirs Category:Books about politics of the United Kingdom Category:2017 in British politics Category:Books written by Prime Ministers of the United Kingdom Category:Books by Gordon Brown ","title":"My Life, Our Times"},{"id":"60396231","text":"Setibhor was an ancient Egyptian queen from the End of the 5th Dynasty.

He co-founded the Tony Award winning and highly influential Crossroads Theatre Company of New Jersey, and is an acclaimed director on both American and International stages. As a writer, Khan saw his first play, Fly, premiered in 2007 at Lincoln Center Institute of Lincoln Center in New York and then at Crossroads, go on to win multiple NAACP Theater Awards in 2018. The play, co-authored with writer Trey Ellis and directed by Khan, has been lauded as a highly innovative and moving theatrical play that makes use of many mediums to tell the story and the trials and triumphs of American World War II heroes, the Tuskegee Airmen. Other plays written or co-written by Khan include Satchel Paige and the Kansas City Swing, Freedom Rider, and Letters From Freedom Summer. == Early life and education == Ricardo Khan was born in Washington, DC, on November 4, 1951, the first of five children of Mustapha Khan, an Indo- Trinidadian US immigrant from Trinidad and Tobago, and his wife Jacqueline (née Driver), from a middle class African American family in Philadelphia. They met as students at Howard University, Mustapha for medicine and Jacqueline for nursing. The family eventually settled in Camden, New Jersey, where Mustapha had a well-regarded medical practice as a family doctor for over 50 years, and Jacqueline, while raising the children and taking take of family, also continued to practice professionally as an educator and volunteer nurse in the community. Following Dr. Khan's death in 2009, an outpouring of love and respect resulted in a street being named after him, Dr. Mustapha M. Khan Way. Ricardo’s schooling was almost entirely in Quaker schools, while his growing up was primarily in city neighborhoods of Philadelphia and Camden, NJ. His parents were active in the American civil rights movement and social advocates for change and self improvement in their communities. Khan and his siblings were also involved in a number of youth groups growing up, including the Cub Scouts, Boy Scouts, Little League Baseball, the black church and the YMCA, and the South Jersey chapter of Jack & Jill, a mothers-led black organization dedicated to exposing their children to education, advocacy, arts and culture, the importance of self-awareness and a life of giving back. On one such monthly outing, a day trip from Camden to New York, Khan saw the 1968 Broadway production of Hello Dolly with an all-black cast. and was mesmerized. Shortly after that, he became active in his high school drama department, a decision that would set in motion a life course of using the arts and the power of live performance as his tool for prompting social change and the development of a mutual respect and understanding among peoples of differing backgrounds in this society and the world. He studied psychology as a Rutgers College undergrad, graduating in 1973 with honors. He went on for graduate theater studies at the Mason Gross School of the Arts at Rutgers University, and earned a double MFA in both acting and directing in 1977. == Career == Not long after graduating, with L. Kenneth Richardson whom he knew from graduate studies, Khan founded Crossroads Theater in New Brunswick, New Jersey, in 1978. Khan and Richardson had fleshed out the idea for the company in a restaurant and wrote their mission on a napkin: To change the too-limiting environment of black theater of that day, and encourage a bolder, more real and more human professional existence in the arts for African-American theater artists. Khan served first as Co-Founder/Producer and Executive Director of Crossroads, and then as its Artistic Director beginning in the late '80s, developing, staging and commissioning plays by African-American playwrights for fully developed, well-rounded and truthful African-American characters and stories. During his tenure the company introduced several revolutionary American plays, including works by August Wilson, George C. Wolfe, Rita Dove, Mbongeni Ngema, Harold Scott, Ruby Dee and Ntozake Shange. American theater icon, innovator, director and playwright Joseph Papp called Crossroads one of his two favorite theaters. Crossroads won a Tony Award for Outstanding Regional Theater in 1999, the first to ever be awarded to an American Black theatre company. In the process of retiring from Crossroads, Khan told the New York Times: To a certain degree, forming Crossroads was about trying to change the world. But it was really, really about wanting to play a part in the world's turning—not just out on its side or margins, but actual a part of an artistic world that turns to glorify the human spirit. That's what we were about then, and that's what we're about now.\\" In December 1999, Khan left his company to begin a one year sabbatical in Trinidad and Tobago, his father's birthplace, which later took him to South Africa in search of a new, more global language and way of addressing the African American experience and attendant psycho-sociological challenges of trying to live a free life while black in America. He believed that the new way could come only from a new, more global self-view of the African American and his condition in the context of a global self-definition. While he was abroad, Crossroads unexpectedly closed its doors for a season, in 2000, overwhelmed by a one-and-a-half to two million US dollars' debt. and to decide on its next organizational direction and leadership. Crossroads was eventually revived, and in 2003, asked Khan to return to help re-open the theatre, albeit on a smaller scale than before. Since then, Crossroads has continued to produce as an undeniable force in the American Theatre. And as Artistic Director Emeritus, Khan remains active as a creative advisor. Since 1999, Khan has been a freelance director with artistic homes in New York at Lincoln Center, in Washington, DC at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, and in Kansas City where he was a Visiting Professor for the professional graduate training program at the University of Missouri from 2008 to 2018. He also lived for periods of time in Trinidad and South Africa, and started an international collective of writers called The World Theatre Lab, based simultaneously in New York, London and Johannesburg. In 2005, with a commission by Lincoln Center’s Lincoln Center Institute for an original new play, Khan began writing. His first, Fly, was co-written with Trey Ellis. But it was originally inspired years before by the stories Khan heard of the Tuskegee Airmen of Work War II, upon which he developed the pay, Black Eagles, in 1989 at Crossroads with playwright Leslie Lee. Khan directed Black Eagles for Crossroads, the Ford’s Theatre in Washington, DC, and Manhattan Theatre Club in New York, and recalled that after he first learned of the African-American fighter pilots and began working on the play, he discovered that he was related to one of them, his mother’s cousin Elwood T. \\"Woody\\" Driver who was one of the original Tuskegee Airman. Roscoe C. Brown, another original Tuskegee Airman[2], served as chief advisor to Khan in both Black Eagles and Fly until his death in 2016. Fly's debut at Lincoln Center in 2007 was as a 60-minute play, where Khan sought an almost video-game like stage style and also engaged a \\"tap griot\\" character—a tap dancer whose role was similar to a Greek chorus and portrayed the emotions and parts of the story the airmen were not allowed to express—It was a way to reach younger audiences on their aesthetic level. But after the 2009 inauguration of President Barack H. Obama where the Tuskegee Airmen were honored as special guests., Khan and Ellis incorporated that historic event and developed their script into a full length play for all ages, which premiered in the fall of 2009 at Crossroads. Since then, across the country Fly has been professionally produced several times. Its 2017 New York staging, a co-production between Crossroads, the Pasadena Playhouse and the New Victory Theatre in NY was nominated for eight 2018 NAACP Theater Awards, winning three: Best Production, Best Lighting and Best Choreography. In 2013, Khan teamed up with Trey Ellis again to write Satchel Paige and the Kansas City Swing, a play about Jazz and Negro Leagues Baseball set against the backdrop of America in 1945, the year Jackie Robinson broke the color barrier in the major leagues, and when the country was in the beginnings of the integration movement. Like Fly, Satchel Paige and the Kansas City Swing premiered at Crossroads before going on to major productions across the country. In 2015, Khan conceived of a multi- narrative play, Freedom Rider, which evolved into an extraordinary collaboration with four other writers, Kathleen McGhee-Anderson, Murray Horwitz, Nathan Louis Jackson and Nikkole Salter, involving an interracial group of college students on a bus headed south in 1961. In 2018, as a sequel to Freedom Rider, Khan partnered with Denise Nicholas and South African born writer Sibusiso Mamba, on Letters From Freedom Summer, set in 1964 during the struggle for voting rights in Mississippi. In 2016 Khan served as producer and director of the highly acclaimed opening night gala ceremonies for the Smithsonian’s new National Museum of African American History and Culture in Washington, DC on September 24 of that year, involving performers and creatives that included Yolanda Adams, Daniel Beaty, Dave Chappelle and Frederic Yonnet, Ava DuVernay, Savion Glover, Oprah Winfrey and Stevie Wonder. Khan holds an MFA in both acting and directing from Mason Gross School of the Arts, and an Honorary Doctorate from Rutgers University where he is also in the University’s Hall of Distinguished Alumni. He has also served on the Board of Theatre Communications Group, the national organization of America’s professional theatres, and from 1995 to 1998, was the organization's President. == References == Category:Living people Category:1951 births Category:American people of Trinidad and Tobago descent Category:American dramatists and playwrights Category:African-American dramatists and playwrights Category:American theatre directors Category:African-American theater directors Category:Rutgers University alumni ","title":"Ricardo Khan"},{"id":"60396309","text":"The Lintianshan Forestry Culture Park () is a forest in Fenglin Township, Hualien County, Taiwan. ==History== ===Empire of Japan=== Forestry began in the area since 1918 with a name of Molisaka. The park was originally the ground for logs processing area from Mount Da'an during the Japanese rule of Taiwan. Felling works were done by Hualien Harbor Timber. In 1925, the area was declared by the Japanese government as the Lintianshan logging area. In 1939, Hualien Harbor Timber was renamed to Taiwan Kougyou Kabusiki Gaisya and established the Taiwan Xingye Company Lintianshan Logging Office. Since then, several railways, dormitories and buildings were established to support the business there. ===Republic of China=== After the handover of Taiwan from Japan to the Republic of China in 1945, the Resource Management Committee of the Ministry of Economic Affairs took over the site and it was named Senrong. The management of the site was then assigned to Taiwan Paper Company. In 1954, the site was transferred to private company. The logging activities reached their peak in 1960. In the same year, a fire destroyed the log mill, water pipes and hydrants at the area. In 1972, the site was transferred to Zhongxing Paper Company operated by Taiwan Provincial Government. In the same year, a month-long wildfire destroyed 1.2 km2 of the forest area. In 1973, the logging industries were in decline and the control of the site was assumed by the Forestry Bureau. In 1988, the logging activities at the site were completely halted. The bureau then merged the two sites at Guangfu and Fenglin under the Wanrong Work Station of the Hualien Forest District Office. Soon after that, a plan to establish the Lintianshan Forestry Culture Park at the site was put into the discussion. In 2006, the site was declared a historical village by the Cultural Affairs Bureau of Hualien County Government. ==Architecture== The forest consists of former offices and residential buildings, dormitories, logging tools and machines, rail tracks, elementary school and a church. Currently the site is divided into the forestry exhibition area, early settlement buildings and the remains of Kangle New Village, administration and management area and hiking trails. ==Transportation== The forest is accessible west of Wanrong Station of Taiwan Railways. ==See also== * List of parks in Taiwan ==References== Category:2006 establishments in Taiwan Category:Buildings and structures in Hualien County Category:Forest parks in Taiwan ","title":"Lintianshan Forestry Culture Park"},{"id":"60396322","text":"The Lualaba worm lizard (Monopeltis adercae) is a worm lizard species in the family Amphisbaenidae.

Following the ceremony the Court Brahmins of the Devasathan Temple, led by the Chief Brahmin of the Royal Family of Thailand, blessed the plaques and the Seal. The Royal Horoscope was engraved by the court astrologer Chatchai Pinngern, who was present during the ceremony. ===29 April=== Tree plantings of yellow star trees, considered royal trees by the king, were conducted nationwide in every forest and national park in all 76 provinces. ===1 May=== In a ceremony at the Amphorn Sathan Residential Hall the king officially married Gen Suthida Tidjai and officially designated her as Queen of Thailand. The ceremony was held with Princess Sirindhorn, the Princess Royal, and the President of Privy Council Prem Tinsulanonda as witnesses. ==Royal coronation== ===2 May=== At 16:09 (UTC+07:00), The King, Queen Suthida and Princess Bajrakitiyabha paid homage to the Equestrian statue of King Chulalongkorn and the Memorial of Rama I . He also paid respect to sacred icons placed at both the Phaisan Thaksin Throne Hall and Chakraphat Phimarn Royal Residence. Nationwide, mass Buddhist monastic ordinations in honor of the coronation were organized by the National Office of Buddhism and the Sangha Supreme Council (Mahāthera Samāgama) in all 76 provinces together with their respective provincial and local governments, with 6,810 receiving their holy orders of monkhood, including personnel of the civil services, the armed forces and police. ===3 May=== At 10:00 (UTC+07:00), The Royal Golden Plaques and the Royal Seal of State were transferred from Wat Phra Kaew to Phaisan Thaksin Throne Hall (Phra Thinang Phaisan Thaksin) in procession, and they were placed into the hall by the Lord Chamberlain of the Chakri dynasty, Air Chief Marshal (ret) Satitpong Sukvimol, RTAF. The Weapons of Sovereignty were earlier transferred from the Temple to a special table in the hall. In the late afternoon, Buddhist monks assembled for the benediction vigil chanted the traditional Paritta Suttas for the coronation and laid a protective thread around the buildings of the Phra Maha Monthien group within the wider Grand Palace complex as a precaution against evil spirits, preceded by a candle lighting ceremony and then, following the recitation of the Five precepts, by the lighting by Supreme Patriarch Ariyavongsagatanana (Amborn Ambaro) in the Amarin Winitchai Throne Hall (Phra Thinang Amarin Winitchai Mahaisuraya Phiman) of the Victory Candle (Candle of Victory, เทียนชัย) in the presence of the king, signifying the official commencement of the ceremony. Following this, a senior monk formally declared the official commencement of the coronation ceremonies in both Pali and Thai (the sacred languages of the Buddhist religion in Thailand). 35 monks were stationed at the Phaisan Thaksin Throne Hall, where the soon to be crowned King was present as the presider of the vigil service, with another 5 being assigned to the Chakraphat Phimarn Royal Residence (Phra Thinang Chakraphat Phiman). After the chanting the Chief Brahmin gave the King the leaves of certain trees, such as the Aegle marmelos, that were esteemed in ancient times for their supposed medicinal and purifying values, which, following being dipped in holy water, were brushed by him on the head and hair to symbolise purification and gave them back later to the Chief Brahmin before being burned. These leaves were earlied dipped by the Court Brahmin from the Devasathan Temple as part of a Hindu ceremony called the homa (sacrifices to fire). After the monks departed, the king then gave offerings of flowers, each to the Hindu deities in Devasathan, to the sacred white royal nine-tiered umbrellas (five dotted around the various palaces), and to the images of the guardian spirits of the capital city at the city shrine, preceded by a second candle lighting rite paying respect to sacred Buddha images and guardians of the holy thrones in the palace. After this senior government officials took their places with persons of royal descent and the Court Brahmin around the Octagonal Throne where a ceremony was held to bless the throne. Preceding the vigil, the king made a short visit to Wat Phra Kaew. ===4 May=== King's Guard of the Royal Thai Army fired a 101-gun salute at Sanam Luang during the coronation ceremony. At 10:09 (UTC+07:00), the Royal Purification, or the Song Muratha Bhisek Ceremony, took place at the Chakraphat Phimarn Royal Residence (Phra Thinang Chakraphat Phiman), in the presence of the Supreme Patriarch and the Chief Brahmin, preceded by the reading of the Five Precepts. Shortly afterwards, King Maha Vajiralongkorn switched to a white dress trimmed with gold for purification ceremony. After making offerings and paying respects, the King sits in a specially erected pavilion. As a shower of sacred water poured upon his head, a 40-gun salute was fired and the prakhom band trumpeters sounded a fanfare. Within the precincts of the Palace, the Royal Guards played the Royal Anthem as monks recited their chants of benediction. Sacred water is also being given by the Supreme Patriarch, HSH Prince Pusan Svastivatana, HSH Prince Chulchern Yugala and the Chief Court Brahmin, Phra Maha Raja Guru Bidhi Sri Visudhigun. The King then cleansed himself with the waters collected earlier from all 76 provinces across Thailand. The ablution rite was then followed by the Anointment Ceremony at the Phaisan Thaksin Throne Hall's Octagonal Throne, in which the King was presented with 9 bowls of consecrated water from the government officials and royal representatives who were present the previous night, representing the Thai people, the royal family and the state government, wherein he was formally granted the full authority of his kingship in accordance with the religious and historical traditions of the state and the Constitution. In each of the directions of the throne, the Chief Brahmin gave the king the bowl of water, in which he dipped his hands, and following the act the Royal Nine-Tiered Umbrella was presented to him after the Court Brahmin chanted a Hindu mantra. Only after the Royal Umbrella is presented which symbolises the full consecration of the King, the King from that point can be addressed as Phrabat Somdet Phrachaoyuhua (Thai: พระบาทสมเด็จพระเจ้าอยู่หัว) Then the king proceeded to the Bhadrapitha Throne and was seated under the Royal Nine-tiered Umbrella as the new consecrated sovereign, where, after paying homage and reciting the Tamil mantra \\"Opening the portals of Kailash\\" (from the Tiruvacakam), the Chief Brahmin presented him with the Royal Golden Plaque and other official royal regalia, during which the Royal Anthem was officially played, a fanfare sounded and a 101-gun salute from the Ceremonial Gun Battery, 1st Battalion, 1st Field Artillery Regiment, King's Guard of the Royal Thai Army fired at both the Grand Palace and the Sanam Luang Royal Plaza as similar salutes were fired in the provinces in saluting stations manned by personnel of the Royal Thai Armed Forces, while bells were rung in Buddhist temples nationwide. Distinctive blowing of conch shells were heard as the King crowned himself with the 7.3 kg Great Crown of Victory at 12:10 (UTC+7:00). After the Crowning and Investiture Ceremony, in response to the Chief Brahmin formally informing him of new royal title and the benediction that preceded it, the king presented the First Royal Command to the Court Brahmins and the Chief Brahmin of the Royal Family, in the following manner: Following the exchange, he then poured water into a bowl as an offering to Phra Mae Thorani the goddess of earth in an ancient Hindu rite of ratification and confirmation for a good deed. This was followed by the consecration and installation of Queen Suthida as Queen of Thailand, wherein following the proclamation of her installation he awarded her with the insignias of the Order of the Royal House of Chakri and the Order of the Nine Gems, while fanfare and music is played and a Buddhist benediction said. Following this the King scattered gold and silver flowers and coins among the Court Brahmin and members of the royal family as alms. Minutes after the Victory Candle was extinguished at the Amarin Winitchai Throne Hall amidst the chanting of the monks in the presence of Their Majesties. At 13:19 (UTC+07:00), the ceremony of Assumption of the Royal Residence then followed at the Chakraphat Phimarn Royal Residence. At 14:00 (UTC+07:00), The king held an audience with members of the Royal Family, the Privy Council, government officials, members of the diplomatic corps and representatives of public and private enterprises at the Phuttan Kanchanasinghat Throne inside the Amarin Winitchai Throne Hall, where he gave his first address to the nation as crowned sovereign of the people and nation of Thailand. The loyal address on behalf of members of the Royal Family was made by Princess Maha Chakri Sirindhorn, the Princess Royal, followed by the loyal address on behalf of the government, civil service, armed forces and police which will be taken by the Prime Minister of Thailand, Gen (ret) Prayut Chan-o-cha, RTA, and the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, Judge Cheep Chulamon, and the loyal address on behalf of the people which was made by the President of the National Legislative Assembly of Thailand, Pornpetch Wichitcholchai. During the first playing of the Royal Anthem, another 21-gun salute was fired in Bangkok. At 16:00 (UTC+07:00), the king proceeded to Wat Phra Kaew to proclaim himself the Royal Patron of Buddhism and be granted a final coronation blessing, following which, he ended the day with a sunset visit to the Dusit Maha Prasat Throne Hall to pay tribute to his royal ancestors. A short memorial service was held, wherein the new king offered orange robes to the presiding group of monks in gratitude for their presence. ==== Full order of government officials and royal representatives who gave consecrated holy water to the King at the Octagonal Throne ==== * His Serene Highness Prince Pusan Svastivatana *His Serene Highness Prince Mongkhonchaloem Yugala *His Serene Highness Prince Chaloemsuek Yugala *Gen (ret) Prem Tinsulanonda, RTA, President of the Privy Council *Gen (ret) Prayut Chan-o-cha, RTA, Prime Minister of Thailand * Pornpetch Wichitcholchai, President of the National Legislative Assembly of Thailand * Gen (ret) Anupong Paochinda, RTP, Minister of the Interior * Judge Cheep Chulamon, Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Thailand ===5 May=== Ratchadamnoen Nai Avenue, east side of Sanam Luang.

He was responsible for killing three prostitutes in the span of 10 weeks in 1894, and although many suspects were arrested, nobody was convicted of any of the murders. The Strangler is also supposedly responsible for the 1898 murder of clairvoyant Julia Voght and 1903 murder of Mabel Brown, but this remains only speculation. ==Murders== ===Lena Tapper=== A French prostitute with a reputation of being \\"unchaste\\", Tapper previously lived in Fulda, Minnesota and later Heron Lake, before moving to Denver as the mistress of Richard Demady. Both were part of a secret French order called the Macquereaux, or \\"Les Cavaliers d'Amour, in which Tapper played the role of a sex servant. On September 3, 1894, she was found choked to death on her bed in her Market Street residence. ===Marie Contassoit=== She was also a French prostitute with ties to the Macquereaux, living with her lover Tony Sanders. On the day of her murder, Sanders had fallen asleep while reading a newspaper, and on the following day, Contassoit was found dead in her bed, choked to death. A small stout cord was so tightly drawn that it was buried into the flesh, with finger marks around her neck. The fact she was considered a wealthier woman, and the fact that she had only 75 cents left on her at the time of death, led authorities to believe that robbery was the motive for the killing. Five men were arrested for her murder, among them Tapper's lover Demady, who had made advances towards her. Two of the men, Antonio Santopietro and Emil Taymens, were quickly dismissed. Santopietro had previously been dismissed from the police force and worked as a messenger, with Contassoit showing preference towards him. Meanwhile, Taymens, a cook employed by Marie, was described as being jealous of Santopietro. Both were in the house at the time of the murder, but they hadn't heard any disturbance. Both were later released due to lack of evidence. ===Kiku Oyama=== A 24-year-old Japanese immigrant, Oyama first came to the USA through Chicago at the time of the World's Columbian Exposition. There she got acquainted with Imi Oyama, a cook, allegedly starting a relationship with him. Both came to Denver in November 1893. A few days prior to her murder, police had raided the local prostitution businesses and arrested several of her associates. Oyama, with the help of a French saloon keeper, secured their release, but the saloon keeper later demanded a monetary sum as a reward for his efforts. This angered Oyama, who quarreled with him about it. Later, one of the released women said that Kiku \\"made too much talk\\" about the saloon keeper. On the evening of November 13, Kiku Oyama was last seen alive. After a short talk with her friends, she returned to her house, drew the curtains and was assumed to have fallen asleep. Her lover Imi had gone out for a walk, and after his return, he found her lying on the bed with a towel around her neck. She was still alive and gasping for air, and despite Imi quickly pulling off the towel, Kiku was on the verge of death. In a panic, Imi ran across the street and called Hana, another Japanese woman, for help. Their behavior attracted the attention of Officer Carberry, who entered the room with them. However, Kiku had already died. There was heavy indication that a heavy struggle had taken place in the room: the bed sheets were disturbed and covered with blood; a second towel, dampened, laid upon the washstand, and the killer had rifled through the room's drawers, most likely looking for money. Keys for the front and back of the house had also disappeared. Oyama had ginger marks near her windpipe, as well as non-lethal bruising on her forehead. She was most likely thrown on her back upon the bed after the towel had been tied to her neck, before being deliberately garroted. Imi Oyama, along with several Japanese women, were arrested on suspicion, but quickly released due to lack of evidence. ===Suspected murders=== * Julia Voght - a clairvoyant and medium, Voght lived in an apartment on Champa Street. During the initial murders, she claimed to the authorities that spirits had given her a description of the Strangler while she was in a trance. On October 7, 1898, she was found dead in her apartment, lying on the floor with a towel tied tightly around her neck. It is believed that the Strangler either truly believed she had known something or that he was superstitious, deciding to get rid of her to avoid exposure. * Mabel Brown - in 1903, nine years after the initial murders, Brown was found dead in her room on Market Street. Her hands had been tied with a pair of suspenders, a handkerchief had been put in her mouth and her throat had strangulation marks. Like the other victims, she was found lying on her bed. There was also speculation that the Strangler was responsible for other murders, among them the murders of Mary Eckert (July 25, 1894 in Cincinnati, Ohio), Minnie Keldt (May 31, 1894 in New York City, New York) and Josie Bennett (June 30, 1894 in Buffalo, New York). Alfred Knapp was later electrocuted for Eckert's murder, as well as several others, in 1904. ==Suspects== ===Richard Demady=== One of the prime suspects in the case was Frenchman Richard Demady, who lived with Lena Tapper and was also part of the Macquereaux. He was only charged with the death of Tapper, and despite the fact that the evidence was circumstantial, he was considered the most \\"promising\\" strangler. The announcement caused great excitement in the country, with the District Attorney's office claiming they could prove that he strangled at the very least Tapper. The detectives even spent hours listening to the mad ravings of Demady's sister, Mme. Fouchette, who was imprisoned at the County Hospital because of her mental illness. Fouchette supposedly went mad from brooding over her brother's arrest, and claimed to see the ghosts of the victims. Whether the prosecutor used any of the information she provided or not is unknown. A total of 45 witnesses were brought in to testify, among them Laura Johnson, a woman with whom Demady was intimate, who was supposed to give a sensational testimony against him. The prosecution in the case also brought two alleged witnesses, a man and a woman, who claimed to have witnessed Tapper struggling with Demady through their window. The prosecuting attorney claimed to have conclusive proof, including a check written by Demady, which was used to bribe a judge into releasing him. Despite all the alleged evidence, the jury gave a verdict acquitting Demady of strangling Tapper. After the trial, he moved to Brazil. ===Frank Roch=== A married French Canadian roustabout who lived in a small house near Market Street, Roch was arrested by authorities when it was discovered he matched the description of a man running away from the Oyama crime scene shortly after the murder. It was also discovered he had associated with the Macquereaux in the past. However, police quickly realised that even if he knew something about the murders, Roch most certainly wasn't the killer. After a few days, he was released after authorities failed to obtain anything in the form of a confession. ===H. Meller=== On November 18, 1894, an Italian man known only as H. Meller (or Moeller) entered the house of Marie Vendres, and after a quarrel, he began strangling the woman. He squeezed her so hard that Vendres was unable to make a sound, but using her strength, she managed to free herself and scream for help. When an officer arrived, Meller was about to cut her throat with a razor. Despite this event, Police Chief Armstrong and the police in general were skeptical that he was the Strangler. Instead, they just considered that he was a man with an ill temper. ===Victor Monchereaux=== An approximately 40-year-old French carpenter with abnormally large hands, Monchereaux first came to the attention of the police after his former friend and fellow Frenchman, Alphonse Lemaire, drunkenly told a story of how he committed the crimes. Lemaire had entered the saloon of a man named Frank Klepfel in a half- drunken state, sitting down at a table and watching an ongoing billiard game, without moving much. Tony Sanders, the lover of the deceased Contassoit who was present at the time and searching for any possible clues, began paying attention to the new arrival. While discussing the strangling cases with a friend, Lemaire began listening to their conversation with great interest. He eventually addressed Sanders about the cases, asking if he spoke French first. Seeing that he could get a clue from this man, Sanders began listening closely, while Lemaire began drunkenly explaining that it was neither Charles Challou (an associate of Contassoit) or the Italian, but a man he knew. Klepfel and half the men in the saloon also began paying attention, giving Lemaire even more alcohol. The now intoxicated Frenchman finally told the alleged killer's name: Victor Monchereaux. After making several abusive statements towards him, Lemaire began explaining how he was a vicious character and how they met. The pair initially met while serving time in San Quentin, California, with Monchereaux arriving in Denver in 1893 and Lemaire three months before the murders. According to Lemaire, Victor strangled all the women with the use of chloroform and then stole all the money they owned. Not only that, but he had also planned to kill another woman by the name of Xavier, using a long plank which he would place in the small back yard to get across. Escape would be easy, as the gate had no lock on it. Monchereaux almost entered the house, but he then heard footsteps in the alley and was frightened off. The Xavier woman was shocked, but didn't report the matter to the police. ===Alphonse Lemaire=== Despite his sensational story, authorities couldn't entirely believe Lemaire's story, as Monchereaux himself later accused him of being the strangler with a similar story. Although police considered that neither of the prisoners were responsible and were simply pawns of the Macquereaux, for a short while, they began suspecting that it was actually Lemaire who might be the strangler. According to Monchereaux's account, the vagabond sailor Lemaire arrived in Denver from Salt Lake City under his real name, Charles Guichard. After meeting him in prison, Victor travelled to Denver and began searching for a job as a watchman. In this time, Lemaire was arrested by Sanders after his story, shortly followed by Monchereaux. In prison, Victor claimed that it was Alphonse who killed the women using chloroform and a towel, to steal their money. His story was partially corroborated by J. W. Williams, a black hod carrier, who had caught up to the men while walking on Market Street and eavesdropped on their conversation. He heard one of the men say \\"I did it\\", but couldn't discern who it was. Monchereaux then continued to claim that after each murder, Lemaire would come to him, telling about how he had done \\"another job\\". After the Contassoit murder, he alleged that Alphonse had disposed of the chloroform and everything else that could put suspicion on him. And two days after the Oyama murder, they met for the last time, with Lemaire confessing to killing all the women and claiming he intended to kill some more. He also remarked about \\"doing [his] work clean.\\" ==See also== * Alfred Knapp, another strangler who operated in the same time frame General: * List of serial killers in the United States ==Bibliography== * ==References== Category:1894 in Colorado Category:American serial killers Category:19th-century American criminals Category:20th-century American criminals Category:Murder in Colorado Category:Crimes in Colorado Category:Unsolved murders in the United States Category:Unidentified serial killers Category:1894 murders in the United States Category:1903 murders in the United States ","title":"Denver Strangler"},{"id":"60396517","text":"Ivan Grigorevich Borisov (; 28 September 1921 – 10 August 1954) was a pilot in the Soviet Air Force who became a flying ace and served as the wingman to Amet-khan Sultan while in the prestigious 9th Guards Fighter Aviation Regiment during the Second World War. == Early life == Borisov was born on 28 September 1921 in the village of Shelukhino in the Moscow area to a Russian family. After completing seven grades of school in 1937 he started working at a local tool factory. He graduated from the Moscow Oktyabrsky flight club in 1939, and from May to December 1940 he attended the Chkalov Central Aeroclub in Tushino, after which he entered the Soviet military. == Military career == Upon entering the military in December 1940 Borisov trained at the Ostafyevsky school of pilots until early summer 1941 when the German invasion of the Soviet Union began; he was immediately deployed to the front as a sergeant in the 309th Fighter Aviation Regiment, which was an air-defense regiment assigned to protecting Moscow. From August to October 1942 he fought in the Battle of Stalingrad while in the 4th Fighter Aviation Regiment. For having shot down three enemy aircraft by Autumn 1942 he was awarded the Order of the Red Banner. In October he was reassigned to the 9th Guards Fighter Aviation Regiment as a flight commander, which he served in for the remainder of the war. He flew his first sorties in the regiment flying as a wingman to Vladimir Lavrinenkov; he then flew under the command of Amet-khan Sultan until he was promoted to the rank of captain and made commander of the second squadron in 1944.

The zamindars of Bihar were numerous and could be divided into small, medium and large depending on how much land they controlled. Within Bihar, the zamindars had both economic and military power. Each zamindari would have their own standing army which was typically composed of their own clansmen. The majority of these zamindars usually belonged to upper-caste Hindu communities such as Kayasthas, Maithil Brahmins, Bhumihars and Rajput. Raja Bahadur Bedanad Sinha, the zamindar of Banaili ==Relations with the Mughals== Mughal rule in Bihar was characterised as turbulent and volatile as many of the region's zamindars made continuous efforts to defy the imperial authority. Generally, the Mughals had great difficulty in subduing the chiefs of Bihar. Many of the major zamindaris and chieftaincies in the suba of Bihar were located in hilly and forested areas which proved beneficial in terms of dealing with potential conflicts. These zamindars had an obligation to pay tribute to the Mughal authorities but rebellions were common and in many instances the army would have to be sent in to Bihar to subdue the rebellious zamindar. A notable instance of this occurred in 1503 when Raja Sangram Singh of Kharagpur Raj rebelled and was subsequently killed in battle. His son was then converted to Islam and became a staunch ally of the Mughals. The nineteenth century British civil servant, John Beames noted about Mughal-ruled Bihar that \\"everyone who was powerful enough to rob the state or his neighbours, robbed to his hearts content\\". Zamindars refusing to pay the state and gathering forces to attack neighbouring zamindars was a common practice in Bihar during this period. This attitude to authority continued into the period when the Nawabs of Bengal and Murshidabad became the nominal governors of Bihar. Although Bihar had the potential to provide a large amount of revenue and tax, records show that the Nawabs were unable to extract any money from the chiefs of Bihar until 1748. And even following this, the amount gained was very low. This was again due to the rebellious nature of the zamindars who were \\"continually in arms\\". In 1781, their control of Bihar was disturbed when some of the zamindars (especially those in South Bihar) started to rise in revolt following the rebellion of Chait Singh, the Maharaja of Benares state. Among the rebels in Bihar, were Raja Narain Singh of Seris-Kutumba, Akbar Ali of Narhat Samoy and Fateh Bahadur Sahi of Huseypur. Among the motivations for the rebellion was the reluctance of these zamindars to provide revenue to the British. However, many zamindars in Bihar were also loyal to the British and refused to take part. Eventually the British were able to subdue the rebellion without too much trouble. ==Abolition== Lalkothi palace which belonged to the Gidhaur chieftaincy Following independence in 1947, there was large-scale support in Bihar for the abolition of zamindari especially among peasants, agricultural labourers and the urban middle-class who stood to gain the most from this. This culminated in a large-scale movement in support of abolition led by lower-castes. The Bhumihar zamindars realised that abolition was going to occur and planned for abolition to be on their terms. However, the Rajput- Kayastha zamindars strongly resisted this. Thus, in Bihar the resistance for Zamindari abolition came not only from the landlords but also from the Rajput- Kayastha lobby who followed delaying tactics in the passage of Zamindari Abolition Bill. The only exception to this was K B Sahay. Eventually, the Bihar Abolition of Zamindaris Act was passed in 1949. ==Notable zamindari estates== *Gidhaur chieftaincy *Banaili *Deo Raj *Hathwa Raj *Ledo Estate *Tekari Raj *Kharagpur Raj *Bettiah Raj *Jagdishpur estate *Dumraon Raj *Raj Darbhanga *Cheros of Palamu *Ramgarh Raj *Sonbarsa Raj *Jharia Raj ==See also== * Indian feudalism * Indian honorifics * Jagirdar * Ghatwals and Mulraiyats * Thakur * Zamindars of Bengal * List of amendments of the Constitution of India ==References== Category:History of Bihar Category:Zamindari estates ","title":"Zamindars of Bihar"},{"id":"60396565","text":"Sharon Green Middleton (born May 1, 1954) is an American Democratic politician, serving as a member of the Baltimore City Council since 2007 and its Vice President since 2016.

On 17 March, 14 soldiers were killed when ISIL forces captured the T-2 Pumping Station. In the following days, government forces made attempts to recapture T-2. One week after the capture of the station, 26 government troops and nine ISIL fighters were killed during clashes in the desert near Mayadin. Between 24 and 29 March, several ISIL attacks were repelled in the Mayadin area, while between 31 March and 1 April, ISIL forces were driven back from the T-2 area. In early April, ISIL forces in the Homs Governorate employed an inghimasi attack on the Shaer gas field near Palmyra. The battle lasted for several hours, with the attack eventually being repelled by the Syrian Army with assistance of Russian attack helicopters. Concurrently, ISIL seized several points between Abu Kamal and Mayadin. Attacks were also conducted along the Sukhnah-Deir ez-Zor highway. In Mid-April, ISIL attacks south of al- Qaryatayn left 18 pro-government and five ISIL fighters dead, with the militants seizing several positions. ISIL made further advances by seizing an air defense base south of the town, but were again repelled by Russian-backed government forces. Pro-government forces also regained positions along the Sukhnah-Deir ez-Zor highway. Meanwhile, ISIL attacks continued in the Mayadin area and on 18 April, 25 pro-government and 13 ISIL fighters were killed in clashes, while on 20 April, ISIL attempted to attack the T-3 Pumping Station. Between 8 and 11 May, the Syrian Army managed to push ISIL 60 kilometers from Mayadin, clearing 1,500 square kilometers of territory in an attempt to split the ISIL pocket in the desert. On 22 May, an ISIL attack involving suicide bombers and armored vehicles on a military outpost near the T-3 Pumping Station left between 26 and 30 pro-government fighters dead, according to the pro-opposition Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) and local residents, while the military put the death toll at 16. The next day, ISIL militants attacked a Syrian-Russian military convoy near Mayadin, leaving 35 pro- government forces dead, including nine Russians. Four of the Russians were regular soldiers, while Russia reported that 43 attackers were also killed during the fighting. Three days later, ISIL conducted more attacks near Mayadin and Abu Kamal. On 4 June, ISIL attacked government forces along a 100-kilometer front from Mayadin to Abu Kamal, capturing two or three towns on the western bank of the Euphrates. The militants attacked on two fronts, with ISIL fighters coming from both the desert, west of the Euphrates, and from their territory on the eastern bank of the river. A few days before the assault, around 400 ISIL fighters crossed the Euphrates from their enclave to the east following heavy shelling of government positions. The capture of the towns cut the Deir ez-Zor-Abu Kamal highway. The following day, pro-government forces recaptured the areas they had lost. On 8 June, ISIL renewed its offensive and managed to break the Army's lines around Abu Kamal by using 10 suicide bombers, including several SVBIEDs. ISIL fighters managed to break into the city and fighting came close to the city center. The attack once again cut the highway. However, the Army subsequently counterattacked and by the following day it was reported that the military managed to re-capture the city. During the fighting, the commander of the Syrian Army's 11th Armored Division, General Ali Muhammad al-Hussein, was killed in clashes on the Abu Kamal outskirts. The commander of Hezbollah's Rocket Division and two Iranian IRGC members, including an officer, were also killed. ISIL's offensive against Abu Kamal continued on 10 June until the militants withdrew from the city on 11 June. Overall, 246 pro-government and 138 ISIL fighters were killed between 22 May and 11 June. On 17 June, ISIL launched a surprise attack on government forces around the T-3 Pumping Station, destroying one tank and killing several Syrian soldiers. The next day, government reinforcements from the Republican Guard, National Defence Forces, Liwa Fatemiyoun, as well as additional Hezbollah fighters, were sent in preparation for a new operation against ISIL in the region. The same day, the military seized several ISIL positions between T-2 airbase and al-Hamima and by 20 June pro-government forces reportedly cleared 1,200 km2 of territory in the Homs-Deir ez-Zor region, killing at least 50 ISIL militants. In addition, government forces seized 2,500 square kilometers of ISIL-held territory along the Iraqi border on 21 June. However, ISIL attacks from the Deir ez-Zor desert on government positions around the Euphrates continued throughout the summer, during which dozens of Syrian Army soldiers were killed; some estimates by the local observers were that up to 1,000 ISIL fighters were still hiding in the Homs- Deir ez-Zor desert pocket. On 31 August, the Syrian Army and the pro- government Palestinian militia Liwa al-Quds launched a large anti-ISIL operation. forcing ISIL to retreat far into the desert. Later, ISIL attacks on 2 September near Mayadin and south of Deir ez-Zor left 22 pro-government and at least eight ISIL fighters dead. The Syrian Army advanced 30 kilometers into ISIL territory during an offensive between 10 and 11 September and advanced further between 14 and 15 September, nearly splitting the pocket. By the end of 15 September, the military had reportedly captured three towns. By this point, since the offensive started on September 10, 10 pro-government and eight ISIL fighters had been killed. On September 16, ISIL launched a large counter-offensive, recapturing all of the territory it had recently lost and killing over 25 soldiers. However, on 17 September, the military counterattacked and once again captured all the areas it had lost the previous day. The Army reportedly continued to advance against ISIL by 19 September, amid fighting that left another nine ISIL fighters and two government soldiers dead, until fighting died down. On 4 November, 11 people were killed in an explosion at a Syrian military base along the highway connecting Damascus and Deir ez-Zor, including six Russian private military contractors. The next day, during fighting east of Sukhnah, five soldiers and eight ISIL fighters were killed. ===2019=== The death of three Russian soldiers was confirmed after they had gone missing during an ISIL ambush in late February 2019. Several Syrian servicemen were also reported killed in the ambush. According to Russia, a group of more than 30 ISIL fighters who took part in the ambush were tracked down and “destroyed”. Around the same time, a Russian PMC was killed by a landmine in the region. At the end of February, the military started combing operations in the desert against the ISIL pocket and in early March, the Army conducted airstrikes against ISIL positions near Sukhnah, while preparations were taking place for the military to launch an operation in the area. On 30 March, Syrian Army reinforcements were sent to the Palmyra countryside after several ISIL ambushes took place along the Palmyra-Deir ez- Zor highway over the previous two weeks, one of which-on 24 March-left five soldiers dead. Two days later, at the start of April, ISIL conducted a large attack on Army positions near Palmyra which was repelled after airstrikes were conducted by the Syrian Air Force. By 3 April, more Syrian Army reinforcements were sent in anticipation of a new ISIL attack on government positions. Meanwhile, a group of soldiers went missing following an ISIL ambush along the road near Haribshah on 31 March. On 11 and 18 April, two more ambushes took place with another military convoy going missing along the road between Palmyra and Deir ez-Zor,Syrian Army convoy disappears along Palmyra Highway, ISIS ambush suspected while an Army unit was ambushed north of al- Sukhnah.Syrian Army suffers heavy casualties after ISIS carries out another ambush near Palmyra In addition, heavy fighting took place between 12 and 14 April, involving members of the Palestinian Liwa al-Quds militia.The last 48 hours witness the killing of at least 14 members in Deir Ezzor desert of al- Quds Brigade, the regime forces, and militiamen loyal to them In April 2019, ISIL activity indicated that the terrorist organization was in control of Jebel Bishri, a mountain near the intersection of the borders of the Raqqa, Deir ez-Zor, and Homs Governorates, as well as the surrounding area between the Al-Sukhnah and Deir ez-Zor countrysides. On 21 April, ISIL captured the mountainous town of al-Kawm, forcing the Syrian Army and pro-government Palestinian militias to retreat. ISIL hit-and-run attacks continued into late June and fighting between 24 March and 23 June, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, left 161 pro-government and 53 ISIL fighters dead.A new attack by ISIS members in Al-Mayadin Desert kills and injures about 15 members of the militiamen loyal to the regime forces of Syrian and non- Syrian nationalities Of the pro-government dead, 10 were Palestinian Liwa al- Quds militiamen, while nine were Iranian-led troops and two were Russians. Over 70 of the soldiers were killed in the month of April alone. ===2020=== ISIL attacks continued throughout 2019 and into 2020. Between March 2019 and October 2020, 792 pro-government and 397 ISIL militants had been killed in the fighting in the desert. Government fatalities included 140 Iranian-led fighters and two Russians. 11 civilians were also killed. In February 2020, the SAA, backed by Russian military units, launched an offensive to capture Jebel Bishri and its surrounding regions, which had been under ISIL control since April 2019. This offensive coincided with an NDF offensive to clear out ISIL forces from the southeast Raqqa Governorate region. In early March, the SAA managed to clear the Jebel Bishri and its environs, including al-Kawm; however, ISIL attacks continued in the region, with the majority of ISIL forces apparently having relocated during the offensive. ISIL attacked pro- government forces in al-Sukhna in the Syrian Desert on 9 April 2020. More than twenty fighters on each side were killed. In early July, 18 pro-government fighters and 26 ISIL militants were killed, after a jihadist assault on government positions near al-Sukhna. Syrian Observatory for Human Rights activists monitored an armed attack by unknown gunmen in August, believed to be carried out by ISIL cells, a vehicle affiliated to government-backed militias in the area between Al-Tabani and Ma’adan in southern Al-Raqqah was targeted. The attack resulted in the death of the “head of Al-Tabani district” and two othergovernment-backed militiamen. On 18 August, an IED planted by unknown assailants, targeting a Russian convoy on a side road near Deir Ezzor exploded killing a Russian Major General and left three soldiers injured, one of which died almost a month later. Russia held ISIL responsible even though no group claimed responsibility the attack.Second Russian officer reported dead in Syria after ISIS attack On the same day, the Russian and Syrian air forces carried out a large-scale joint operation aimed at wiping out ISIS cells across the Syrian Desert. According to Russia, the operation killed 327 ISIL militants, destroyed 134 shelters, 17 observation points, 7 stores of ammunition and 5 underground warehouses for weapons and ammunition from 18 to 24 August. Since 1 September, SOHR activists have documented great fatalities among both sides due to the military operations in the Syrian desert, including airstrikes, security campaigns and attacks. At least 38 ISIS members and 19 Syrian soldiers and loyal militiamen were also killed in the same period. On 5 September 2020, it was reported that the SAA had recaptured the Doubayat Gas Field from ISIL, following a 12-day offensive, thus recapturing the remainder of ISIL's pocket in the Syrian Desert. By 21 September, the SAA had secured control of the area, with aid from the Russian Armed Forces. However, the large-scale ISIL insurgency in the region continued unabated. On 23 September, ISIL forces launched a large-scale attack on SAA forces near the Raqqa–Homs Governorate boundary, killing many Syrian soldiers. In response, the Syrian Army moved to increase its presence in the Syrian Desert. On 25 September, it was reported that Russian and Syrian warplanes had destroyed multiple ISIL hideouts in the Central Syria region. A source from the SAA stated that ISIL would likely be able to continue hiding in the Syrian Desert, until the Syrian Army carries out a large-scale campaign with thousands of soldiers to clear every single cave used by ISIL. ==Casualties== Between December 2017, and April 2020, at least 860 pro-government fighters were killed during the desert insurgency. The SOHR documented the deaths of 822 pro-government fighters and 439 ISIL militants between late March 2019, and the start of October 2020. ==See also== * 2017 Western Iraq campaign * Eastern Syria insurgency * Battle of Baghuz Fawqani – A battle in 2019 for the final ISIL stronghold in Syria * Daraa insurgency ==References== Category:Iraqi insurgency (2017–present) Category:Military operations of the Syrian Civil War in 2017 Category:Military operations of the Syrian Civil War in 2018 Category:Military operations of the Syrian Civil War in 2019 Category:Military operations of the Syrian Civil War involving the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant Category:Military operations of the Syrian Civil War involving Iran Category:Military operations of the Syrian Civil War involving Russia Category:Deir ez-Zor Governorate in the Syrian Civil War Category:Homs Governorate in the Syrian Civil War Category:Major phases of Syrian Civil War ","title":"Syrian Desert campaign (December 2017–present)"},{"id":"60396615","text":"10th Avenue, formerly known as Macario Asistio Sr. Avenue or simply Asistio Avenue, is a four-lane undivided street in Caloocan, Metro Manila, Philippines that stretches east–west, bisecting South Caloocan. Like most avenues in this area of Grace Park, it crosses a near-perfect grid system of numbered streets that run north–south, with other numbered avenues running east–west. 10th Avenue was formally renamed to Asistio Avenue prior to reverting it to its current numbered name owing to it being the tenth avenue running east–west from the city's border with Tondo, Manila in the south. The former renaming was done in 1984 to honor the former Mayor of Caloocan who served from 1962–1971 and the father of another Caloocan mayor Boy Asistio, but has since been disregarded and reverted. 10th Avenue and the present-day subdivision of Grace Park through which it travels was a pre-World War II civilian airfield known as the Manila North Airfield or Grace Park. This airfield which opened in 1935 near the then-newly built Bonifacio Monument was Manila's first commercial airport that served as a hub for Philippine Airlines for its first domestic routes. The airport was decommissioned after the war and was transformed by the government into a residential and industrial area. == Route description == 10th Avenue in the vicinity of Barangay 91 in Grace Park East 10th Avenue is a national road classified by the Department of Public Works and Highways as a tertiary road.

The avenue is divided into two segments by Rizal Avenue which also serves as the dividing line between Grace Park West and Grace Park East. At its western segment, 10th Avenue begins just east of the 10th Avenue railway station in Barangay 64 and curves slightly to the north before the intersection with Vibora Street and straightens out as it crosses several streets towards Rizal Avenue. Landmarks along this segment include the Caloocan public library, Caloocan High School and Caloocan City Science High School. East of Rizal Avenue, it runs in an almost perfectly straight line to its other terminus in Grace Park East. Located along this segment is the Caloocan campus of Systems Plus College Foundation. The New Caloocan City Hall is accessible via 8th and 9th Streets, a full block south of 10th Avenue.

Proletpen was founded on September 13, 1929 as a continuation of the Frayhayt Writers Association (which had suffered mass resignations after the newspaper Frayhayt denounced the role of Zionists in the 1929 Palestine riots). The name 'Proletpen', a Russian-style Yiddish conoction of proletarische pen ('Proletarian pen'), was projected as an antonym of the Yiddish PEN Club. The group was affiliated with the Moscow- based International Union of Revolutionary Writers. Proletpen predated the John Reed Clubs, a grouping of American English-language progressive writers, by a month. Proletpen poets dealt with social issues, poverty and racism. Proletpen poets included Aaron Kurtz, A. Suhl, Martin Birnboim, I. Greenshpan, L. Miller, D. Seltzer, L. Dinski, Ber Green (A. Prince), B. Fenster, B. Friedman, I. E. Rontch, Meinke Katz and Moishe Shifris. Prose writers associated with Proletpen included Leo Yurman, Chaver Paver, L. Chanukoff, Leib Sobrin, Chaim Margoles-Davidson, David Kasher and S. Deiksel.

She is currently a professor at the University of Notre Dame in Notre Dame, Indiana, although she is originally from Seattle, Washington. == Biography == Raised in a white middle- class neighborhood in Seattle, with seven other siblings of second generation Mexican descent, Lopez found inspiration in her personal life for her works. As a photography student at the University of Washington in 1986, she dabbled in digital images. While still in school, her father died and Lopez turned to old photo albums to reminisce, when she did this the photos awoke a curiosity and she became inspired to rewrite the narratives differently than what the photographs presented. She did so by creating digital images, originally editing from family photos she eventually started using anonymous portraits. Discussing that the family photos represented her family history and that the digital elements represented her memories, gives the images the surrealistic and yet comfortable feel. == Education == Lopez has a Bachelor's degree from University of Washington in Seattle, and a Master's degree in 1990 from the School of the Art Institute of Chicago. She is currently a professor of Photography in the Art History department at the University of Notre Dame. == Artwork == === Between Reason === Influenced by personal connections to 19th century portraits and motivated by the fear that someday she may be lost to existence just as the subjects of the portraits, Lopez created the series Between Reason (2012-2014). The images are both nonsensical and familiar, the landscapes are meant to be constructed and ethereal while she lends elements like her eyes, hair and her own family. The prints themselves are constructed, waxed in the encaustic technique then attached to the wall with no frame but steel corners that becomes backlit allows the viewer to ponder memory and reality. === Remembrance === Martina describes this series (2009-2010) as \\"...coming from facing my own mortality.\\" The prints are spiritual and ghostly in appearance, but heavy and grounded in the reality of mourning, existence and the future. Taken on Lake Michigan, where her children play and where she has many memories, the children representing innocence and the possibility of future depicted look as if they're floating unsure of what is next. === The Mourning of Memory === The project (2003-2006) was separated into small digital prints and ambryotypes, which are images reflecting on glass. The subject itself is a landscape, specifically from two patches of land that are similar looking but during different times of the year, making the viewer aware of time, in which \\"... each insignificant day adds up to a year and eventually a lifetime.\\" The images themselves were scavenged from thrift stores, making them lost and forgotten, a theme that Martina seems to continually come back to in her works. The restructuring of these forgotten images and putting back into context is similar to the recollection of memory. === Memory Reference === In this series (1990-1998), Lopez incorporates not only her personal family photos but other photos owned by individuals, in doing so she creates a more personal and applicable narrative of memory and family. During the time in which she created these images, computer assisted mediums were just able enough to create this surreal like narrative that ties memory and personal connections for people who are otherwise unseen but in memory and picture. The stillness of the figures and the horizon of reality behind them are to be visual dairies of Lopez, although she feels that the personal connections only drive to the images creation. === Through the Looking Glass === In 2007-2008, did a series depicting her journey with breast cancer. All of the images are focused on a circle in the center of the image, the mirror, presenting what Lopez sees when she herself looks into the mirror. Her missing breast with incision marks is central to the narrative of herself, her bald head and her patients gown are what she is, her cancer is an inescapable truth. She voices that, \\"It never leaves you and although it was in the past, you know it could also be your future.\\" == Collections == Lopez's work has been held at The Crossroads Gallery for Contemporary Art, in which curator David Travis writes an extensive description of her work in relation to the collection. Other museums such as the Seoul Museum of Art, The Philadelphia Museum of Art, and the Art Institute of Chicago have featured her work. == Honors and awards == Awarded National Endowment for the Arts Visual Arts Photography Fellowship. == Publications == * Aperture Magazine, Portfolios 1: Computer Photomontage (1994) * Naomi Rosenblum's A World History of PhotographyRosenblum, Naomi: World history of photography.

The Vatican also provided a summary of the document by Andrea Tornielli, the editorial director of the Holy See's Dicastery for Communication. The 35,000 words in the English translation are organized into 299 paragraphs in nine chapters. Francis quoted the concluding document of the synod, discussed the problem of sexual abuse, as well as other abuses, committed by \\"some bishops, priests, religious and laypersons\\" and asked the young to participate in keeping priests true to their vows and vocations. He wrote: \\"If you see a priest at risk, because he has lost the joy of his ministry, or seeks affective compensation, or is taking the wrong path, remind him of his commitment to God and his people, remind him of the Gospel and urge him to hold to his course. In this way, you will contribute greatly to something fundamental: preventing these atrocities from being repeated.\\" The document also acknowledged, among other things, the church's history of promoting male domination and clerical protection of \\"members of the Church\\" who committed \\"the abuse of power, the abuse of conscience, sexual and financial abuse\\" against women and children.

The review went on to say, \\"unsurprisingly for a Mohrschladt design, the Orion 27 has conservative lines. Under the waterline is a long keel with a forefoot cutaway to improve nimbleness and reduce wetted area. The sections carry the tried and true wine-glass shape.

It is a union territory of India. == First inhabitants == The earliest archaeological evidence documents some 2,210 years. However, genetic and cultural studies suggest that the indigenous Andamanese people may have been isolated from other populations during the Middle Paleolithic, which ended 30,000 years ago. Since that time, the Andamanese have diversified into linguistically and culturally distinct, territorial groups. The Nicobar Islands appear to have been populated by people of various backgrounds. By the time of European contact, the indigenous inhabitants had coalesced into the Nicobarese people, speaking a Mon-Khmer language; and the Shompen, whose language is of uncertain affiliation. Both are unrelated to the Andamanese, but being closely related to the Austroasiatic languages in mainland Southeast Asia. == Chola empire period == Rajendra Chola I (1014 to 1042 AD), used the Andaman and Nicobar Islands as a strategic naval base to launch an expedition against the Sriwijaya Empire (Indonesia). The Cholas called the island Ma- Nakkavaram (\\"great open/naked land\\"), found in the Thanjavur inscription of 1050 AD. European traveller Marco Polo (12th–13th century) also referred to this island as 'Necuverann' and a corrupted form of the Tamil name Nakkavaram would have led to the modern name Nicobar during the British colonial period. == Danish colonial period and British rule == The history of organised European colonisation on the islands began when settlers from the Danish East India Company arrived in the Nicobar Islands on 12 December 1755. On 1 January 1756, the Nicobar Islands were made a Danish colony, first named New Denmark, and later (December 1756) Frederick's Islands (Frederiksøerne). During 1754–1756 they were administrated from Tranquebar (in continental Danish India). The islands were repeatedly abandoned due to outbreaks of malaria between 14 April 1759 and 19 August 1768, from 1787 to 1807/05, 1814 to 1831, 1830 to 1834 and gradually from 1848 for good. Andaman tribals fishing (c. 1870) From 1 June 1778 to 1784, Austria mistakenly assumed that Denmark had abandoned its claims to the Nicobar Islands and attempted to establish a colony on them, renaming them Theresia Islands. In 1789 the British set up a naval base and penal colony on Chatham Island next to Great Andaman, where now lies the town of Port Blair. Two years later the colony was moved to Port Cornwallis on Great Andaman, but it was abandoned in 1796 due to disease. Denmark's presence in the territory ended formally on 16 October 1868 when it sold the rights to the Nicobar Islands to Britain, which made them part of British India in 1869. The Cellular Jail was a colonial prison used to exile political prisoners. In 1858 the British again established a colony at Port Blair, which proved to be more permanent. The primary purpose was to set up a penal colony for criminal convicts from the Indian subcontinent. The colony came to include the infamous Cellular Jail. In 1872 the Andaman and Nicobar islands were united under a single chief commissioner at Port Blair. == World War II == During World War II, the islands were practically under Japanese control, only nominally under the authority of the Arzi Hukumate Azad Hind of Subhash Chandra Bose. Bose visited the islands during the war, and renamed them as \\"Shaheed-dweep\\" (Martyr Island) and \\"Swaraj-dweep\\" (Self-rule Island). Nathu Singh, commanding officer of the Rajput Regiment, following their surrender of the Islands, 1945 CE. General Loganathan, of the Indian National Army was made the Governor of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. On 22 February 1944 he along with four INA officers—Major Mansoor Ali Alvi, Sub. Lt. Md. Iqbal, Lt. Suba Singh and stenographer Srinivasan—arrived at Lambaline Airport in Port Blair. On 21 March 1944 the Headquarters of the Civil Administration was established near the Gurudwara at Aberdeen Bazaar. On 2 October 1944, Col. Loganathan handed over the charge to Maj. Alvi and left Port Blair, never to return.Roychowdhury, Rabin. \\"Black Days in Andaman and Nicobar Islands\\", Manas, New Delhi. Japanese Vice Admiral Hara Teizo, and Major-General Tamenori Sato surrendered the islands to Brigadier J A Salomons, commander of 116th Indian Infantry Brigade, and Chief Administrator Mr Noel K Patterson, Indian Civil Service, on 7 October 1945, in a ceremony performed on the Gymkhana Ground, Port Blair. == Post-Independence (1947 CE – present) == During the independence of both India (1947) and Burma (1948), the departing British announced their intention to resettle all Anglo-Indians and Anglo- Burmese on these islands to form their own nation, although this never materialized. It became part of India in 1950 and was declared as a union territory of the nation in 1956. India has been developing defense facilities on the islands since the 1980s. The islands now have a key position in India's strategic role in the Bay of Bengal and the Malacca Strait. === 2004 Asian tsunami === On 26 December 2004, the coasts of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands were devastated by a massive tsunami following the undersea earthquake off Indian Ocean. More than 2,000 people lost their lives, more than 4,000 children were orphaned or suffered the loss of one parent, and a minimum of 40,000 people were rendered homeless. More than 46,000 people were injured. The worst affected Nicobar islands were Katchal and Indira Point; the latter subsided and was partially submerged in the ocean. The lighthouse at Indira Point was damaged but has been repaired since then. The territory lost a large amount of area which is now submerged. The territory which was at Indian states is now at .Effect of the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake on India While locals and tourist of the islands suffered the greatest casualties from the tsunami, most of the aboriginal people survived because oral traditions passed down from generations ago warned them to evacuate from large waves that follow large earthquakes. == References == === Notes === === Citations === Category:Andaman and Nicobar Islands ","title":"History of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands"},{"id":"60397387","text":"Richard Taylor Bellhouse (9 May 1825 - 7 December 1906) was an English first- class cricketer, watercolourist and architect.

Consequently, I’m not always sure what they mean.\\" Swan also was troubled by the lack of role- playing material, saying, \\"There’s little about the alchemist’s personality, no meaningful adventure hooks, no compelling reasons why alchemists would be more fun to play than, say, a priest or a paladin.\\" He concluded by giving the book an average rating of 3 out of 6, saying that few players would likely play an alchemist, but that \\"referees should find The Compleat Alchemist to be an invaluable resource for adding color to their campaigns and creating oddball treasure items.

It pioneered best practices for the elimination of obstetric fistula in Uganda over 16 years. The organization focuses on maternal and reproductive health. Headquartered in Soroti, TERREWODE's efforts target the empowerment and education of young women in rural communities. TERREWODE's activism focuses on women's rights to maternal, reproductive and sexual health, as well as the treatment and social reintegration of victims of obstetric fistula. ==History== TERREWODE was founded in 1999 by Alice Emasu. Since then, it has evolved into one of the country's leading non-governmental organizations with four holistic programs to support both curable and incurable cases. These programs include: Awareness and Advocacy, Prevention, Treatment, and Social Reintegration. TERREWODE has collaborated with the Ugandan Ministry of Health, the United Nations, Amref Health Africa, and Gender Health to support over 4,000 women since its inception. ==Programs== ===Awareness and Advocacy=== TERREWODE's Awareness and Advocacy program joins with partners such as the Obstetric Fistula Awareness and Advocacy Network (OFAAN), a network of trained outreach volunteers who identify cases and spread awareness. Volunteers identify women with the condition and connect them with TERREWODE for treatment opportunities. This program operates at district and community levels, and interacts with district authorities. It uses platforms such as law enforcement, health care services, media, schools, or other community organizations to connect victims to members. TERREWODE provides education on reproductive rights and training activities. ===Prevention=== TERREWODE's Prevention program is aimed at improving local health care and economic systems to prevent cases of obstetric fistula. One approach involves the creation and distribution of free birth kits at health centers to incentivize expectant mothers to receive care and give birth at health centers, resulting in fewer birth complications. This program uses OFAAN to provide fistula education, such as discussion about common causes and risk factors of the condition. OFAAN partners with schools to promote girls' rights. The OFAAN volunteer network does additional work in helping expectant mothers create a plan for the delivery of their baby, which includes encouraging them to save money, seek out health care and avoid risk factors for the condition. ===Treatment=== TERREWODE's Treatment program acts to identify women suffering from obstetric fistula and assist them in accessing treatment, typically involving surgery. TERREWODE partners with the Ugandan Ministry of Health, local health centers and local and international health personnel. TERREWODE requests grant funding to help women who otherwise may struggle to afford treatment. Grant funding has been used to provide additional training on treatment procedures to health personnel. ===Social Reintegration=== TERREWODE's social reintegration program targets women who have received or have attempted to receive treatment for their condition and aims to help them reposition themselves within their social environment. In 2013, TERREWODE received funding from the Worldwide Fistula Fund to establish a Social Re-Integration Center, offering services such as counseling, support groups and resources, nutritional guidance and training in income-generating activities. ==Terrewode Women's Community Hospital== TERREWODE has partnered with Hamlin Fistula USA to establish the Terrewode Women’s Community Hospital. After relative success in treating childbirth injuries in Ethiopia for forty- five years through the Addis Ababa Fistula Hospital, the organization moved to Uganda. The hospital will target the approximately 50,000 Ugandan women believed to be living with obstetric fistula. ==Staff== The organization is run by a group of local professionals, including: * Alice Emasu: Founder and Executive Director * Lillian E.

She obtained her habilitation from the University of Mainz in 1993, with financial supported from the DFG: two years later accepted a teaching chair at Augsburg. In 1999 she became a guest professor at the University of Pittsburgh Center for West European Studies, and in 2003 (in combination with an associate directorship of studies) at the Paris \\"Maison des Sciences de l’Homme\\". There have been numerous other study visits in North America, Mexico and Israel. Between 2008 and 2011 she served as dean of the Faculty of History and Philology at Augsburg. This was followed by her election as university president on 8 June 2011 in succession to Wilfried Bottke, the appointment taking effect in October of that year. Her book \\"Das Okkulte\\" appeared in 2008 and won for her the \\"Prize for the Promotion of the Translation of Humanities Literature\\" (\\"Preis zur Förderung der Übersetzung geisteswissenschaftlicher Literatur\\") from (jointly) the Fritz Thyssen Foundation, the German Book-trade Exchange (\\"Börsenverein des Deutschen Buchhandels\\") and the German Foreign Ministry. The book addresses the contemporary growth in interest in The Occult and compares it with other manifestations of \\"Unreason\\" through the ages, tracking developments from the Middle Ages to the present, in the context of \\"new media\\" such as the invention of printing and, more recently, of the internet. She also identifies Wikipedia as a \\"forum for occult content\\".Das Okkulte. Eine Erfolgsgeschichte im Schatten der Aufklärung. Von Gutenberg bis zum World Wide Web.

Asked by an interviewer in 2011 about her marriage, she joked that for twenty years the two of them had lived with a long-distance relationship which \\"everyone\\" had predicted would cause the marriage to end after two or three years. Such predictions had been wrong, though she volunteered that, despite having taken it on, she had never really wanted a double-barrelled name. In a panel discussion organised in 2012 by the (pro- free market) Bavarian Free Democratic Party, Sabine Doering-Manteuffel came out as a supporter of university tuition fees as a way to fund universities.

There he taught Hebrew and Polish and published a Polish grammar textbook for Yiddish-speaking children. In 1855 Peltyn settled in Warsaw to work in journalism and publishing, publishing articles promoting reform of Judaism, productivization, and the cultural Polonization of Jews. In 1865 he established the Izraelita, a Polish weekly devoted to Jewish interests, remaining its editor throughout his life. In this journal he wrote, besides feuilletons, articles on religion, ethics, Jewish history, and anti-Semitism, with the goal of encouraging Jewish assimilation into mainstream gentile culture. He wrote also a number of tales of Jewish life, and made translations of the works of Leopold Kompert and others. Peltyn was active in the Reform temple in Warsaw and attempted to give a Polish rather than a German orientation to the service and the sermon. In 1875 he published an article arguing for the introduction of the organ into synagogue liturgy. Peltyn was strongly opposed to Yiddish language and literature, seeing the language as standing in the way of the Europeanisation of Jews. In 1896, not long before his death, Peltyn's article was featured on the front page of Izraelita to protest against the project promoting Yiddish publications in Warsaw. Upon his death in 1896, Peltyn's position as editor- in-chief of Izraelita was taken over by Nahum Sokolow. ==References== Category:1831 births Category:1896 deaths Category:German–Polish translators Category:Jewish non-fiction writers Category:Jewish translators Category:People from Marijampolė Category:Polish editors Category:Polish Jews Category:Polish-language writers ","title":"Samuel Peltyn"},{"id":"60397664","text":"The Louisville Cardinals Men's Ice Hockey team is an American Collegiate Hockey Association (ACHA) Division 2 college ice hockey program that represents the University of Louisville.

Deshpande considered Lokamanya Tilak as his Guru. Deshpande served as Chairman of Karnataka branch of All-India Spinners' Association, and the All India Village Industries Association for some years. Deshpande was largely responsible for the installation of Premier of Bombay, B. G. Kher. == Early life == Deshpande was born on 31 March 1871 into a Kannada-speaking Deshastha Rigvedi Brahmin family in Hudli, Belgaum, Karnataka. His father Balkrishna Deshpande was a Vatandar. == Political work == Deshpande's work during the Swadeshi Movement of 1905-1906 centered around the boycott of British goods, encouragement of locally produced (swadeshi, स्वदेशी) goods, promotion of national education, and opposition to the partition of Bengal. Freedom fighters Govindrao Yalgi and Gangadhar Rao Deshpande first planned to host Ganesha festival as a public event in 1905 for the cause of uniting the people of all faiths to fight against the British. The first 'sarvajanik' (public, सार्वजनिक) Ganesha idol was installed at Govindrao Yalgi's residence. On invitation by Deshpande, Lokamanya Tilak, who initiated the celebration of Ganapati Festival, visited Belgaum for the Ganapati festival in 1906. Deshpande invited Mohandas Gandhi to a political conference at Belgaum in 1916, so that Gandhi could meet Lokamanya Tilak. Deshpande supported the Non-Cooperation Movement.

Pampa Sarovar, later called Congress Well, which was constructed with cost of ₹ 4,370 and 3 annas, as a water source to the 1924 convention, still exists in Vijaynagar Veerasoudha Udyana. Freedom fighters Jawaharlal Nehru, Subhash Chandra Bose, Sarojini Naidu, Motilal Nehru, Saifuddin Kitchlew, Annie Besant, Shaukat Ali, and R H Kulkarni were also present on the occasion. Deshpande started a khadi unit at Kumari ashram near Hudali, the first khadi unit in Karnataka. Deshpande went from village to village to create awareness about the khadi movement. This work was later continued by Pundalikji Katagade. When Gandhi broke the Salt Act at Dandi and started the Salt Satyagraha Movement, Deshpande defied the law be selling contraband salt and was arrested on the same day. Gandhi visited Hudali in 1937 on the invitation of Deshpande to Gandhi Seva Sammelana (Conference), and stayed for seven days. Others leaders present in the conference were Sardar Vallabhai Patel, Sarojini Naidu, Rajendra Prasad, Abdul Gaffar Khan, Mahadev Desai, Kasturba, along with 10,000 delegates. Gangadhar Rao Deshpande, Pundalik Katagade, Ramachandra Wadavi, Annu Guruji and others helped to build huts for the function.

Originally designed in the early 1940s, its first flight was not made until 1950. Though five variants were developed, only six M-30s were built. ==Design and development== Design work om the Fergeteg began at the Aeroclub of the Technical University (MSrE) in 1942. The intention was to produce a high performance glider able to train pilots in advanced soaring techniques and also in aerobatics, with the performance to set two-seat records. Construction in MSrE's workshop began in 1944 but the partially built aircraft was destroyed in the siege of Budapest the following year. The project was revived in 1948 by the Hungarian National Aviation Association (OMRE). Construction was begun by Sirály Aircraft Ltd. and completed in OMRE's shop at Budaörs. It first flew in August 1950. In 1951 the Hungarian Aeronautical Association (MRSz) replaced OMRE, taking over its role. The M-30 Fergeteg was a wooden aircraft. Its two-piece, mid-set wing was built around single main spars and in plan had rectangular centre sections out to about one third of the span and trapezoidal outer panels with forward swept trailing edges. Ahead of the spar the wing was plywood-covered, forming a torsion resistant D-box. The inner sections were also ply-covered behind the spar and their trailing edges were filled with flaps. The outer panels were fabric-covered and carried split, differential ailerons which reached out to the tips and were interconnected with the flaps. Göppingen type spoilers, mounted behind the spar at the ends of the inner sections, opened both above and below the wing. The wing of the M-30B was very similar, though the ailerons were narrower and the flaps had been removed. A new rivited aluminium box structure strengthened the wing-fuselage joint. The only change on the M-30C was the return of the M-30's flaps, though with simplified linkage. They were removed again on the M-30C/1 and the ailerons were give Frise-type leading edge balances. The Super Fergeteg's wing had had very slightly forward swept leading edges, one piece ailerons and no flaps. All Ferteteg variants had a plywood-covered, elliptical cross-section, semi-monocoque tapering fuselage. They differed in the increasing width of their cockpits and the more refined canopies of their enclosed, tandem, dual control cockpits. The high mounting of the horizontal tail on the tall, narrow integral fin also changed with the M-30C, which had a lower tail on a long dorsal step. The M-30C also introduced a broader rudder, otherwise like the curved, deep rudders of the earlier versions which reached down to the keel. All variants had similar horizontal tails, trapezoidal in plan out to rounded tips and with elevators requiring only small cut-outs for rudder movement because of their forward position. All variants landed on a semi-retractable monowheel under mid-chord with a rubber-sprung skid ahead of it and a small tail skid. Many of these modifications were triggered by a lack of rear seat headroom in the original. The introduction of a raised canopy induced tailplane vibrations which required further changes. Other persistent problems were high aileron control forces, addressed through linkage changes and aerodynamic balancing, and high rudder control forces, which resulted in the M-30C's larger rudder. In the end, only six Fergetegs were built. The M-30C/1s, a final, single seat version, was intended to compete in the World Championships held in Leszno in 1954 (not the World Gliding Championships, flown at Camphill that year). It was not a success. M-30B Fergeteg ==Variants== ;M-30 Fergeteg: Prototype, first flown August 1950. One only. ;M-30B Fergeteg: First flown May 1952. One only. ;M-30C Fergeteg: First flown May 1953.

He was professor of Modern History at Trinity College Dublin and a member of the Royal Irish Academy. Roy Foster referred to him as “the most original and influential Irish historian of his generation” and Diarmuid Ferriter considers him \\"one of the most brilliant historians of his generation\\". Cormac O Grada has stated he \\"will be remembered for his deep, sometimes contrarian, insights and for his takes on a bewilderingly wide range of themes”.https://www.irishtimes.com/opinion/independence-narrative-must-be- freed-of-sweeping-statements-1.3803020 == Early life == Fitzpatrick was born in Melbourne, Australia to Brian Charles Fitzpatrick, an author and journalist and mother Dorothy Mary (née Davies) a historian at the Monash University. His elder sister, Sheila Fitzpatrick is a historian of modern Russia. At birth, Fitzpatrick was given three names as their parents could not decide on either David, Brian or Patrick. To the family he was initially known as Pat, but later took to using his first name. His parents instilled in their children a strong sense of academic achievement. Two months before his Matriculation examinations his father died during a research trip to Sydney.Don Watson, Brian Fitzpatrick: A Radical Life, Hale & Iremonger, 1979, p. 287 His parents were not separated as claimed elsewhere. Fitzpatrick nevertheless topped the State of Victoria in Modern History, adding an Exhibition to his other awards and scholarships. He went on to study history at the University of Melbourne and resided at Trinity College. His first foray into Irish history, through his love of the poetry of W.B. Yeats, was his B.A. Hons.thesis, 'The Dancer and the Dance: The Social and Political Ideas and Activities of William Butler Yeats from 1916 to 1928'. Fitzpatrick graduated in 1969 before moving to La Trobe University as a tutor. After discussions there with the fellow Irish historian John O'Brien, he moved to do a PhD at Trinity College, Cambridge. == Academic career == Fitzpatrick spent his professional life at Trinity College Dublin, where he was appointed a lecturer in Modern History in 1979. In 1982 he was made a Fellow, an Associate Professor 1993 and a Professor in 2000. Prior his move to Dublin, he spent time as a Prize Research Fellow between 1975 and 1977 at Nuffield College, Oxford and returned to the University of Melbourne for two years as a research fellow (1977–79). He published his first book, Politics and Irish Life, 1913-1921: Provincial Experience of War and Revolution in 1977. Based on his PhD thesis the publication was described as 'fair, balanced and neutral, with a touch of irreverence, indeed a model of objectivity'. == Personal life == Fitzpatrick was married twice. He first married Georgina Huege de Serville (known as Haigh) a historian who studied the Australian War Trails. They had a son, Brian and daughter, Margaret. The marriage was dissolved in 1999. His second marriage was to Jane Leonard, an Irish military historian, with whom he had two daughters, Julia and Hannah. He died, aged 70 in Belfast after suffering a long illness. == Bibliography == === Monographs === Politics and Irish Life, 1913-1921: Provincial Experience of War and Revolution (Gill & MacMillan, 1977) Irish Emigration 1801-1921 (Economic and Social History Society of Ireland, 1984) Oceans of Consolation: Personal Accounts of Irish Migration to Australia (Cornell University Press, 1994) The Two Irelands: 1912-1939 (Oxford University Press, 1998) Harry Boland's Irish Revolution, 1887-1922 (Cork University Press, 2004) Solitary and Wild: Frederick MacNeice and the Salvation of Ireland (Lilliput Press, 2012) Descendancy: Irish Protestant Histories since 1795 (Cambridge University Press, 2017) Ernest Blythe in Ulster: The Making of a Double Agent?

Saunders parentage is unknown. He married Anne Dartiquenave, daughter of Charles Dartiquenave, and sister of Charles Dartiquenave of St James's, Westminster, paymaster of the board of Works. Saunders was in the merchant service before joining the Royal Navy as a volunteer in 1689 on board the Portsmouth, with Captain George St Lo, and became for a short time a prisoner of war when the ship was captured in 1690. In December 1690 he joined the Ossory with Captain Tyrrell, in which he was present in the Battle of La Hougue. On 28 December 1692 he passed his examination, aged twenty-one, after serving in the navy for not quite three years. On 5 December 1694 he was promoted to lieutenant, and in January 1695 was appointed to the Yarmouth with Captain Moody. From 1696 to 1699 he was in the Pendennis with Captain Thomas Hardy. In 1700 he was in the Suffolk and in 1701, in the Coventry, again with Hardy, and in 1702 he was first lieutenant of the St George, the flagship of Sir Stafford Fairborne. He was with Sir George Rooke at Cadiz and at Vigo. Saunders was promoted to the command of the Terror bomb, which he brought home in November after a stormy and dangerous passage. A few weeks later he was posted to the Seaford, a small frigate on the Irish station. By 1705, he was captain. From January 1705, he was in the Shoreham, and continued until 1710, cruising in the Irish Sea, chasing and sometimes capturing the enemy's privateers. He also convoyed the local trade between Whitehaven, Hoylake, Milford, and Bristol on the one side, and on the other from Belfast to Kinsale. From 1710 to 1715 he commanded the Antelope of 50 guns in the Channel. The Battle of Cape Passaro at which Saunders captained the flagship of the British fleet In September 1715 Saunders was sent by Admiral Sir George Byng to Havre and Paris to investigate ships suspected of carrying arms for the Pretender. In 1716 was appointed to the Superbe, and served with Byng in the Baltic in 1717. He was chosen by Byng to be captain of the fleet, in actions against Spain off Sicily and Naples, between 1718 and 1720. He was 1st captain of the flagship Barfleur at Byng's victory at the Battle of Cape Passaro on 31 July 1718. In October 1719, he was sent to negotiate a treaty with the Order of Malta, and in May 1720, he arranged the armistice with Spain. He was knighted for these services by King George I at Hanover on 8 October 1720, while on his way home. In 1721 Saunders was appointed Commissioner of victualling and in 1727 changed posts to Commissioner of the navy. He was returned as Member of Parliament for Queenborough on the Admiralty interest at a by-election on 20 February 1728. He consistently supported the Administration. In 1729 he became Comptroller of the navy treasurer's account and held this post until his death. He became a Rear Admiral in 1731. At the 1734 British general election he was returned again as MP for Queenborough. Saunders died on 5 December 1734. He had one daughter Anna Maria who married William Egerton. ==References== Attribution Category:1670s births Category:1734 deaths Category:Members of the Parliament of Great Britain for English constituencies Category:British MPs 1727–1734 Category:British MPs 1734–1741 Category:Royal Navy officers ","title":"George Saunders (Royal Navy officer)"},{"id":"60398189","text":"thumbPhase out of lightweight plastic products in the United States There is no national plastic bag fee or ban currently in effect in the United States.

In response, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton sent letters to 11 other Texas cities with bag bans telling them that such bans were now illegal and unenforceable. On July 3, 2018, the City of Austin announced that it would end enforcement of its bag ban. *Minnesota has a preemption on local laws that ban plastic bags, but allows for fees on them instead. == California == Californians voted in November 2016 to approve state legislation banning plastic bags statewide in Propositions 67 and 65. Over 100 local laws with similar or tougher regulations will remain and supersede the statewide legislation. { class=\\" sortable mw- collapsible mw-collapsed\\" style=\\"width:100%\\" +Local laws governing plastic bag use in California - ! rowspan=1 width= \\"12%\\"  Region ! rowspan=1 width= \\"15%\\"  County ! rowspan=1 width= \\"15%\\" Jurisdictions covered ! rowspan=1 width= \\"10%\\" Passage date ! rowspan=1 width= \\"10%\\" Effective date ! rowspan=1 width= \\"38%\\" Effect - rowspan=\\"3\\" Central Valley  rowspan=\\"2\\" Sacramento County  Sacramento  2015 – March  2016 – January  rowspan=\\"2\\" Plastic bag ban; 10 cent charge for paper bags. -  Unincorporated territories  2016 – April  2016 – July -  rowspan=\\"1\\"Yolo County  Davis  2013 – November  2014 – July  Plastic bag ban. - rowspan=\\"25\\" Greater Los Angeles Area  rowspan=\\"16\\"Los Angeles County  Beverly Hills  2014 – 22 April  2014 – 1 July  rowspan=\\"7\\" Plastic bag ban; 10 cent charge for paper bags. -  Calabasas  2011 – February  2011 – July -  Culver City  2013 – May  2013 – December -  Glendale  2013 – January  2013 – July -  Hermosa Beach  –  2016 – April -  Long Beach  2012 – February  2013 – January -  Los Angeles  2013 – June  2014 – January -  Malibu  2008 – May  2009 – May  rowspan=\\"2\\" Plastic bag ban. -  Manhattan Beach  2008 – July  2011 – July -  Monrovia  2014 – July  2015 – January  rowspan=\\"7\\" Plastic bag ban; 10 cent charge for paper bags. -  Pasadena  2011 – November  2012 – July -  Pico Rivera  2014 – October  2016 – July -  Santa Monica  2011 – February  2011 – September -  South Pasadena  2014 – October  2014 – December -  West Hollywood  2012 – August  2013 – February -  Unincorporated territories  2010 – November  2012 – January -  rowspan=\\"3\\"Orange County  Dana Point  2012 – March  2013 – April  Plastic bag ban. -  Huntington Beach  2013 – April  2013 – November  Plastic bag ban; 10 cent charge for paper bags. -  Laguna Beach  2012 – February  2013 – January  Plastic bag ban; 10 cent charge for paper bags. -  rowspan=\\"5\\"Riverside County  Cathedral City  2015 – July  2016 – February  Plastic bag ban; 10 cent charge for paper bags. -  Desert Hot Springs  2014 – March  2014 – September  Plastic bag ban.

His only known works were recorded alongside fellow Delta blues musician Calvin Frazier by the American folklorist Alan Lomax in Detroit, Michigan in 1938. ==Biography== Pittman was born in Joiner, Arkansas, United States in 1900. Pittman is listed under the surname of his half-brothers. Pittman is listed under the surname of his stepfather. He was the son of David Pittman and Evelyn (nee Powell) Wellchance Pittman Harrell. It is apparent from his songs \\"I Been Down in the Circle Before\\" and \\"Levee Camp Story\\", that he worked as a construction hand on the Laconia Circle Levee near Snow Lake, Arkansas as a young man. He lived near Blytheville, Arkansas before moving to Detroit, Michigan around 1936. Pittman is listed as living in Blytheville, Arkansas in 1935. In \\"Welfare Blues\\", Pittman notes that he composed the song in December, 1936 in Detroit, suggesting that he had moved from near Blytheville between 1935-1936. Pittman died on June 10, 1945 in Saginaw, Michigan,\\"Michigan Death Certificates, 1921-1952\\" and was buried in Forest Lawn Cemetery in Saginaw. ==1938 recording== Samson was recorded by folklorist Alan Lomax in Detroit, Michigan during three sessions between 15 October - 1 November, 1938. During these sessions, Pittman accompanied Calvin Frazier on guitar on twelve recordings and sang on ten of his own original recordings. The Frazier-Pittman recordings were released by Flyright Records in 1980 on the album I'm In The Highway Man. Pittman's tracks alone were compiled into the 1992 album The Devil is Busy by Laurie Records. ==Discography== *The Devil is Busy, (Laurie Records, 1992) ==References== Category:1900 births Category:1945 deaths Category:Blues musicians from Arkansas Category:Songwriters from Arkansas Category:American male singers Category:American blues singers Category:American blues guitarists Category:American male guitarists Category:Detroit blues musicians Category:Singers from Arkansas Category:People from Mississippi County, Arkansas Category:20th-century American singers Category:20th-century American guitarists Category:Guitarists from Arkansas Category:20th-century male singers ","title":"Sampson Pittman"},{"id":"60398207","text":"right Beyond the Wall of Tears is a 1984 role-playing game adventure for Tunnels & Trolls published by Flying Buffalo. ==Plot summary== Beyond the Wall of Tears is a solo adventure in which the player character's little sister has been kidnapped. ==Reception== Philip L.

This man would later become the index passenger for the infection of another 20 passengers and two aircraft crew, resulting in the dissemination of SARS north to inner Mongolia and south to Thailand. The incident demonstrated how a single person could spread disease via air travel and was one of a number of superspreading events in the global spread of SARS in 2003. The speed of air travel and the multidirectional routes taken by affected passengers accelerated the spread of SARS with a consequential response from the World Health Organization (WHO), the aviation industry and the public. The incident was atypical in that passengers sitting at a distance from the index passenger were affected and the flight was only three hours long. Until this event, it was thought that there was only a significant risk of infection in flights of more than eight hours duration and in just the two adjacent seating rows. Other flights at the time with confirmed passengers with SARS did not have the same extent of infection spread. Some experts have questioned the interpretation of the incident and highlighted that some passengers may have been infected already. The role of cabin air has also come under question and the incident involving Flight 112 has led to some experts calling for further research into patterns of airborne transmission on commercial flights. ==Background== SARS cases and deaths The 2003 SARS epidemic was caused by the then newly emerging subtype of coronavirus (SARS- CoV), which was previously unknown in humans. It was first noted in Guangdong, China in November 2002. Three months later, it surfaced in Hong Kong, Vietnam, Singapore, and Canada. Transmission was primarily through inhalation of droplets from a human cough or sneeze and people affected presented with a fever greater than 38 °C (100 °F) and dry cough, typically appearing as atypical pneumonia. By 28 February 2003, the SARS epidemic had reached Hanoi and was considered of global concern, causing the WHO headquarters in Geneva to issue a global health alert on 12 March 2003, the first since the 1994 India Plague epidemic. Led by the WHO, management of the event consisted predominantly of contact tracing, isolating the affected person and quarantining their contacts. The last known case of human-to-human transmission of SARS was in 2004. Of the more than 8,000 people that were reported to develop SARS between November 2002 and July 2003 worldwide, more than half were from mainland China (particularly Beijing), 20% were healthcare workers and 29 countries reported 774 deaths. Although the overall fatality rate was 15%, it rose to 55% in those over 60. ==Passengers== A Boeing 737-300 of Air China at Hong Kong airport in 2011 On 15 March 2003, Air China Flight 112, a Boeing 737-300, flew from Hong Kong on a three-hour flight to Beijing carrying 120 people including 112 passengers, 6 flight attendants and 2 pilots. The flight had 88% occupancy. The index passenger was a 72-year-old man, LSK, who had been in Hong Kong since 26 December 2002. Later, he had been visiting his sick brother at the Prince of Wales Hospital between 4 March and 9 March 2003, when his brother died. During this time there were known cases of SARS on the same ward and LSK's niece, who had been visiting her sick father, also developed SARS. On 13 March 2003, two days prior to embarking on Flight 112, LSK developed a fever. He then consulted a doctor the next day, one day before taking the flight. He was unwell when boarding the flight and sat in seat 14E. With six people per row, LSK had 23 passengers sitting in front, or in the same row, and 88 passengers sitting behind him. One Taiwanese engineering firm had seven employees on the flight. On 21 March 2003, they returned to Taipei. In addition, there was a group of 33 tourists and an official from the Chinese ministry of commerce. ==Pattern of spread== LSK became the source of infection to another 20 passengers and two crew members. Passengers up to seven rows away from him were affected. Of those later interviewed, eight of the 23 in front or to the side and 10 of the 88 behind LSK, caught the virus. The incident became the largest in-flight transmission of SARS, probably due to the presence of a super-spreader. Upon arrival at Beijing, LSK was seen in hospital but not admitted. The following day he was taken by family members to a second hospital, where he was successfully resuscitated before being admitted with suspected atypical pneumonia. However, he subsequently died on 20 March 2003. Following investigations, at least 59 people with SARS in Beijing were traced back to LSK, including three of his own family and six of the seven healthcare workers from the emergency room during his resuscitation. Within eight days of the flight, 65 passengers were contacted, of which 18 had become unwell. Sixteen of these were confirmed with SARS and the other two were highly probable. Thirteen were from Hong Kong, four from Taiwan and one from Singapore. Another four from China who were not directly interviewed, were reported to the WHO. The average time for the onset of symptoms was four days. None of these 22 people had any other exposure to SARS other than on Flight 112. Flight attendant Meng Chungyun, age 27, travelled home to Mongolia where she infected her mother, father, brother, doctor and husband Li Ling, who later died. Flight attendant Fan Jingling also travelled back home to Mongolia and together both became sources of infection for almost 300 people in Mongolia. The group of 33 tourists who were on the flight destined for a five-day tour of Beijing, were joined by another three people in Beijing. Two of the three were together and the third unconnected. The three and the group were unknown to each other and had different plans before and after the flight. On 23 March 2003, a local hospital notified the Department of Health in Hong Kong of three people with SARS. Contact tracing revealed that these three people were the same three that had joined the Beijing tourist group, 10 of whom also became unwell. Laboratory testing confirmed SARS in all 13. One passenger was an official from the Chinese ministry of commerce. He fell ill in Bangkok. On 23 March 2003, he returned to Beijing, sitting next to Pekka Aro, a Finnish official at the International Labour Organization in Geneva, who was going to Beijing in preparation for a China employment forum. Aro became ill on 28 March and was admitted to hospital on 2 April. He was the first foreign national to die from SARS in China. Five of the passengers from Flight 112 died from SARS. ==Interpretation== WHO investigations of cases of SARS on 35 other flights, revealed that transmission occurred in only four other passengers. One other flight that carried four people with SARS, transmitted it to only one other passenger. In the first five months that SARS spread rapidly, 27 people had been infected on a number of flights, of which a disproportionate 22 were on Air China Flight 112, representing the largest in-flight transmission of SARS. The Flight 112 incident was one of the several superspreading events that contributed to the dissemination of the SARS virus in 2003. Other super- spreaders, defined as those that transmit SARS to at least eight other people, included the incidents at the Hotel Metropole in Hong Kong, the Amoy Gardens apartment complex in Hong Kong and one in an acute care hospital in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. WHO officials had acknowledged that air travellers \\"within two rows of an infected person could be in danger\\". However, the virus had also been found to survive for days in the environment, giving rise to the possibility of spread by contact with surfaces including armrests and tray tables. The whole incident was atypical. Infection typically spreads at the destination but is rarely spread on flight. The air in the cabin is cleaned using high efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters, in a similar way as cleaning the air in an operating theatre. The greatest risk is sitting next to or in the couple of rows in front or behind the index passenger. Medical advisor to the International Air Transport Association, Claude Thibeault, however, felt that the incident had been misinterpreted, saying: \\"people automatically assume there was transmission\\" and \\"we cannot prove there was transmission on this plane. They could have already been infected when they got on board\\". ==Response== During the height of the global epidemic, the occupancy of hotels in Hong Kong dropped to less than 5%, with a couple of the grandest hotels completely empty. The Lancet reported that \\"SARS exemplifies the ever-present threat of new infectious diseases and the real potential for rapid spread made possible by the volume and speed of air travel.\\" The same report also endorsed further research into patterns of airborne transmission on commercial flights. Concerns from aircrew led to the Association of Flight Attendants in the United States to petition the Federal Aviation Administration to issue an emergency order requiring airlines to offer gloves and surgical masks to airline attendants, or at least allow them to bring their own. The effort to control the spread of SARS varied from country to country. Singapore adopted infra-red scanners, Taiwan introduced mandatory quarantine and in Toronto, health notification cards were endorsed. A global standard was subsequently developed by the WHO. The financial cost to the Asia-Pacific region only was estimated to be US$40 billion. Some experts have criticised the restriction of air traffic and closing of national borders during outbreaks, stating that this can lead to difficulties in supplying medical aid to affected areas and closing borders may also deter healthcare workers. In addition, in Michael T. Osterholm's 2017 book the Deadliest Enemy: Our War Against Killer Germs, he says \\"you have to screen many, many people to find anybody with an infectious disease\\". Infra-red scanners may not detect disease in its incubation period and fever may be a sign of many other diseases. ==References== ==External links== *WHO SARS Timeline *\\"Infectious diseases on aircraft\\" Category:2003 in China Category:Aviation accidents and incidents in 2003 Category:Air China Category:2003 in Hong Kong Category:Infectious disease deaths in China Category:2002–2004 SARS outbreak ","title":"Air China Flight 112"},{"id":"60398345","text":"Margo Consuela Bors (born in 1942) is a painter, muralist, photographer, illustrator and enthusiast of nature and native plants mainly focused around the Bay area.

Williams died in London, age 77. ==Health research== Williams was known for his research on obesity and glandular healing. Historian Ina Zweiniger- Bargielowska has noted that Williams \\"linked obesity with the petty comforts of sedentary suburban middle-class life or the rampant consumerism of new wealth.\\"Zweiniger-Bargielowska, Ina. (2010). Managing the Body: Beauty, Health, and Fitness in Britain 1880–1939. Oxford University Press. p. 216. Williams was influenced by the research of Sir William Arbuthnot Lane. He attributed most diseases including cancer to autointoxication (defective operation of the alimentary canal) and slow poisoning from constipation.Late Dr Leonard Williams. Outspoken Writer on Health Topics. The Scotsman. (22 August 1939). p. 11 However, the autointoxication hypothesis was discredited in the 20th century as scientific studies failed to support it.Chen TS; Chen PS. (1989). Intestinal autointoxication: a medical leitmotif. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology 11 (4): 434–441. He recommended periodic fasting and open-air exercise. Williams was an early advocate of a raw fruit and vegetable diet. He warned people of the dangers of over-eating, butcher's meat and tobacco. He attributed many diseases to constipation and \\"intestinal toxaemia.\\" His book The Science and Art of Living, was described in a review as a \\"slashing attack on meat-eaters, sweet-eaters and over-eaters\\".Drake- Brockman, R. E. (1926). Reviewed Work: The Science and Art of Living by Leonard Williams. Science Progress in the Twentieth Century (1919–1933) 20 (79): 555–556. Williams argued against the use of the kitchen stove because he believed it destroys vitamins. He argued that meat, sugars and starches should be replaced with fruit, raw vegetables and unsterilised dairy products.Anonymous. (1925). Death in the Pot. The British Medical Journal 1 (3350): 515–515. Williams was often cited as a fruitarian or vegetarian but he eschewed these labels. He stated that raw fruits and vegetables are essential to health and if they are not eaten then vitamin deficiencies emerge.Williams, Leonard. (1925).

The workers, whose manufacturing activity on the Mexico–United States border is tightly linked to the American manufacturing economy, have low wages relative to local living costs and have demanded 20% pay increases and bonuses. While dozens of companies have accepted workers' demands, others have not and the strikes have spread into other industries. ==Background== Matamoros, in Tamaulipas near the US-Mexican border, is one of Mexico's largest electronics and auto parts producers. Mexico has attracted over 5,000 Maquilladora plants into the country, most of them foreign-owned, by paying workers very low wages. The cost of living for workers on the US-Mexico border is higher than in other locations in Mexico. One striking worker told reporters that he worked 12 hours a day and six days a week for an hourly wage of 75 cents, and that exhaustion and poor safety practices led to frequent accidents. Because maquiladora factories in Matamoros don't pay local taxes, local medical services are underfunded. Matamoros workers decided they would strike for higher pay after Mexican president Andres Manuel Obrador doubled the minimum wage in Mexican states along the border, while Metamoros wages did not increase. While Mexico had seen little labor action in years prior to the strike, grievances against companies, union and labor leaders were common in Metamoros, which had become a hub for cheap labor. ==Strike== On 12 January 2019, 25,000–70,000 maquiladora workers in Matamoros, Mexico went on strike. Striking workers were employees of 45 different factories including AFX, Aipsa, Autoliv, Cepillos, Edemsa, Inteva, Kemet, Parker, Polytech, Starkey, STC, and Tyco. Workers organized their efforts through Facebook, and called for a 20% increase in wages, a $1,700 bonus, lower union dues and a 40 hour work week. Some strikes occurred without the approval of the local union, the Union of Workers in Maquiladora and Assembly plants (SIPTME), and workers stated that the success of their strikes occurred despite the efforts of unions, which they described as corrupt. Striking workers told the World Socialist Web Site that some companies were withholding salaries owed to workers from prior to the strike. On 17 January the workers marched across the city from factory to factory calling for \\"unity\\" and asking other workers to \\"walk out.\\" Workers also protested against unions, and called for a national strike of all workers in Mexico. One week into the strike, economists estimated that the strike was costing the maquiladora industry $23,000 per minute, and had disrupted supplies to General Motors, Ford Motor Company and Chrysler. The next day, hundreds of maquiladora workers at Aptiv in the town of Reynosa were fired for striking in solidarity with Matamoros workers. Matamoros strikes were reported to be patrolled by the Mexican police and Navy. On 21 January, the strike was reported to have slowed production at Ford and General Motors assembly plants in Michigan. On 26 January, The Associated Press reported that nine companies had agreed to meet demands put forward by the Union of Maquiladora Industry Industrial Workers of Matamoros (SJOIIM), and another had announced its plan to leave Matamoros. The union's leader Juan Villafuerte stated that he hoped the strike would be shortly concluded. A few days later, economists estimated that the strike was costing the auto industry $50 million every day. As of 1 February the number of plants experiencing strike action had declined from 45 to 25, while other facilities and industries joined the strike. Striking maquiladora workers were joined by workers from the Spellman, Tapex and Toyoda Gosei factories, and by water purification, milk production, delivery, and Coca-Cola workers. Strikes also occurred in Michoacan and Oaxaca states, where 30,000 teachers blocked train lines. President Obrador stated that the teacher's strikes had \\"nothing to do with left-wing politics\\" and were instead \\"conservative.\\" Workers from Autoliv stated that after the company accepted their demands to end the strike, it fired many of them without severance in retaliation for the strike. By 9 February, 48 maquiladora factories had agreed to worker demands, and ended strikes at those facilities. ==Media coverage== One week into the Matamoros strike, it had still received no news coverage from the U.S.-based New York Times and Washington Post, or the Mexican papers El Universal and Reforma. Mexican newspapers described the strike as a major event in Mexico. The newspaper Milenio wrote that some feared the strike was a \\"contagion\\" on the border, while Manufactura.mx, an industry website, wrote that workers had been \\"contaminated\\" by wage increase demands. ==See also== *Real del Monte 1766 strike *Cananea strike *Río Blanco strike *2006 Oaxaca protests ==References== Category:Education strikes Category:Politics of Mexico Category:Labour disputes in Mexico Category:Foreign trade of Mexico Category:Foreign trade of the United States ","title":"Matamoros strike"},{"id":"60398610","text":"Prof Paul Egerton Weatherley FRS FRSE MIB (1917-2001) was a 20th-century British botanist.https://archiveshub.jisc.ac.uk/features/mar05.shtml In authorship he is usually known as P.

The name is sometimes reserved for males, while female luan are called Jīnjī (金鶏; lit. golden chicken). ==Appearance== Chapters 7 and 16 of the Classic of Mountains and Seas describes the luan as inhabiting paradisaical areas where it sings spontaneously. In Chapter 11, its features are reminiscent of the fenghuang. It is said to trample on snakes while wearing one on its breast. In other sections, it is mentioned as carrying a shield. The Shuowen Jiezi defines the bird as born from the sperm of Chìdì. It is red in color with five-colored markings. Its body is shaped like that of a chicken it sings in the five standard pitches and appears when hymns of praise are sung to rulers. The Sancai Tuhui states that the bird is the transformation of a divine spirit. The Japanese Wakan Sansai Zue of the Edo period further states that due to the viscosity of the luan's blood, it could be used as an adhesive for attaching strings to musical instruments. By the Six Dynasties period, the luan became associated with the Queen Mother of the West. ==Origin== It has been suggested that the luan's origins are the argus, peacock, or golden pheasant. ==Meaning== Like the fenghuang, a sighting of the luan indicates peace. An early legend thought to be from the Warring States period states that the luan was presented as a tribute by northwestern tribes to King Cheng of Zhou as a symbol of submission to his virtue. ==References== Category:Mythological and legendary Chinese birds Category:Japanese legendary creatures Category:Korean legendary creatures ","title":"Luan (mythology)"},{"id":"60398721","text":"Bennett Smith may refer to: * Bennett Smith (kayaker), American whitewater kayaker * Bennett Smith (shipbuilder) (1808–1888), shipbuilder and shipowner in Nova Scotia, Canada ","title":"Bennett Smith"},{"id":"60398730","text":"Joseph W.

The documentary was created and narrated by Chris Rodley for the 50th anniversary of the original airing of the TV series in the UK. The film follows the events surrounding Rodley's visit to interview McGoohan in 1983 for a 1984 documentary about the making of the original series. It premiered at 'Fall In', a celebration of the Prisoner TV series held at the original outdoor location of Portmeirion in north Wales and was released on Blu-ray Disc on 30 October 2017. ==Summary== In 1983, Channel 4, the newly created fourth television channel in the UK, repeated all 17 episodes of the original series of The Prisoner. Following the airing of the final episode - \\"Fall Out\\" - in 1984, the channel had arranged to create a special one-hour programme discussing the making of the series called Six Into One - The Prisoner File. During the creation of this programme, Chris Rodley flew to California to interview Patrick McGoohan, the co-creator of the TV series as well as acting, writing, directing and producing the series. Since the original UK broadcast of the series during 1967 and early 1968, McGoohan had given very few interviews about what The Prisoner meant. Rodley had arranged to interview McGoohan in an empty house in Laurel Canyon in Los Angeles. The recording of this interview was not used and McGoohan requested that they reconvene and re- shoot the interview in Santa Monica. Excerpts from this interview were used in the Channel 4 programme. It was only after McGoohan's death in 2009 that Rodley revisited the original interview and created the In My Mind documentary about the process of interviewing McGoohan. The documentary includes previously unseen interviews, excerpts from the original series, and portions of McGoohan's 1977 interview in Canada with Warner Troyer. Additionally interviews recorded in 1983 are included with Lew Grade whose company financed the series, David Tomblin who wrote the first script (with George Markstein) and produced the series, writer Lewis Greifer and art director Jack Shampan. Additionally, McGoohan's daughter, Catherine, is also interviewed and gives insights into her father's time on the series. McGoohan later saw the cut of the Channel 4 documentary and hated it. He then produced his own interview documentary, known as the L.A. Tape, excerpts of which are shown in the Rodley documentary. The Channel 4 programme Six Into One - The Prisoner File has never been repeated since first broadcast. ==Appearances== * Patrick McGoohan - actor, writer, director and producer * Catherine McGoohan - daughter of Patrick McGoohan * Lew Grade - ITC media owner * David Tomblin - producer, writer * Jack Shampan - art director * Lewis Greifer - writer ==Release== The documentary was premiered at the 50th anniversary gathering at Portmeirion, the village in mid-Wales that was used to portray The Village (the prison 'resort' where McGoohan's character Number Six was incarcerated).

She was the third oldest of her parents' children and was expected to help take care of her younger siblings. Her close family upbringing would become a main artistic theme that she expresses throughout her career. She traveled frequently throughout her life, which helped to culminate her artistic palette. From 1964 to 1966, Damast studied in Paris. From 1967 to 1968, she returned to her native Venezuela. From 1969, she traveled throughout South America in order to cultivate and incorporate more Latin American influences into her art. In 1972, she moved to New York City, where she lived for the rest of her life. While living in New York where Damast adopted Surrealist artistic styles. She died in 2005. == Education == While in Venezuela, Damast attended Ramon Zapata School of Theatre and Literature in 1961 to 1963. She then transitioned into the School of Plastic Arts and, through a school program, was able to travel throughout Europe for several years. == Select artworks == === Memories of Things to Come, 2004 === Memories of Things to Come is an interactive video installation in which Damast utilizes the theme of time to re-imagine childhood from an adult perspective. The installation consists of several chairs and desks in which the participant can sit in. Upon each desk sits a sculptural replica of a heart. Within the sculpture, a video screen plays several images that Susan Hoeltzel states are meant to invoke childhood memories. The installation itself is meant to replicate the feeling of childhood within participants. The videos that play within the heart sculptures all play scenarios that depict children playing or individuals reminiscing about childhood memories. Even the chairs and desks are arranged in a format similar to a classroom setting. This work would be the last art piece Damast produces as she dies the following year. === Untitled (Elba Damast 73), 1973 === The context behind this painting is unknown. The painting displays a side view of a women's body with a view of the body's interior. The interior view depicts strange white and blueish looking organs attached together with strings of color. A spinal column protrude from the woman's back. The painting exemplifies the style in which Damast frequently uses throughout her career. When Damast initially moved to New York in 1972, the city was the forefront of the Surrealist movement. The Surrealist style dominates this painting through the display of ambiguous and mysterious imagery. == Exhibitions == === Solo exhibitions === * 2004 “Memories of Things to Come,” Lehman College Art Gallery, Bronx, NY * 1995 “New Works,” Joel Kessler Fine Art, Miami Beach, FL “Elba Damast,” Art Museum of the Americas, Washington, D.C. * 1994 “The House Within,” Robin Hutchins Gallery, Maplewood, NJ “Recent Works,” Olsson Fine Art, Brussels, Belgium * 1993 “Casa Om,” Plaza de Armas and Casa de la Alcaldia, San Juan, Puerto Rico “Casa Om,” Museum of Contemporary Art, Panama City, Panama “Casa Om,” Museo del Hombre Hondureño, Tegucigalpa, Honduras * 1992 “Casa Om en America,” Morante Gallery, New York City “Casa Om,” Museum Patronato Pro-Patrimonio Cultural, San Salvador, El Salvador “Casa Om,” Museo de Arte Costarricense, Sala Julian Marchena, San José de Costa Rica “Propiedad del Silencio,” Galeria de Arte Ascaso, Valencia, Venezuela * 1991 “Espiritu Abstracto,” Moss Gallery, San Francisco, California * 1990 “Installation,” Museum of Contemporary Hispanic Art, New York City Galleri Orpheus, Eskilstuna, Sweden * 1989 Landskrona Konsthall, Landskrona, Sweden * 1988 Gallery 101, Malmö, Sweden Alexander Ernst Gallery, Washington, D.C.

A teaser was released on April 2, 2019. After being broadcast on seven Fox stations, the show was not commissioned for a full series, since similar projects outperformed it – resulting in a cancellation. ==Background== RuPaul was developed by Telepictures with hopes for a syndicated fall 2019 launch. While most networks picked up shows produced by studios that are also owned by their parent company, RuPaul, being produced by a subsidiary of the independent Warner Bros., had a \\"tougher\\" time finding a network to express interest. According to Deadline, Fox has been \\"open to programs from outside studios\\" and \\"ramping up its limited-run pickups\\" after being downsized following its acquisition by Disney, and this factored into the network picking up the show. ==Overview== The series has been called a \\"modern take on the talk show format\\", with RuPaul saying he wants to \\"spread love\\" with the show. The premiere episode featured late-night talk show host James Corden, and stars of the Property Brothers, identical twin brothers Drew Scott and Jonathan Scott.

It was introduced at the 2019 Mobile World Congress (MWC) in Barcelona, Spain as a successor to the Nokia 8 Sirocco. It alludes to Nokia's previous camera-centric PureView devices, which ended with the Lumia 950 and 950 XL. Like most of HMD's Nokia smartphones, the 9 PureView is part of the Android One program. ==Specifications== ===Hardware and Design=== Key upgrades over the Nokia 8 Sirocco include a faster Snapdragon 845 chip and Adreno 630 GPU, a taller 6\\" 18:9 screen with HDR10 support, a higher resolution HDR selfie camera that can now record in 4K, more LTE bands, faster wireless charging, an in-display fingerprint scanner, and a slightly larger battery capacity. Storage and RAM are unchanged, with a single 128 GB/6 GB configuration. At the rear, a multi-camera setup is featured in a honeycomb- like arrangement with a dual-LED flash and time-of-flight sensor offset to the left and right respectively, and a hole for the microphone above. Externally, the 9 keeps the glass/metal construction of the Sirocco, but it shelves the Sirocco's stainless steel chassis in favor of 6000 series aluminum. ====Cameras==== The 9 PureView uses a penta-camera system with Zeiss optics, 2 of which are RGB sensors and 3 of which are monochromatic sensors. All 5 lenses are identical 12 MP f/1.8 units (Sony Exmor RS IMX 386). HDR is supported, but the device lacks phase-detection autofocus and optical image stabilization. When a picture is taken, each camera takes a separate image, then the images are combined and processed by a digital signal processor. Pictures can be taken in both JPEG and RAW formats and can be edited afterwards through Adobe Lightroom, which can be installed during setup. Additionally, the 9 has a Pro mode which simulates DSLR settings. A feature called Depth Map captures more than 1200 layers of depth data. Depth Map is enabled by the time-of-flight sensor and only works with JPEG and RGB photos. At the front, a 20 MP sensor is present with HDR. ===Software=== The Nokia 9 ships with Android One's version of Android 9 Pie pre-installed. In December 2019, HMD began to release Android 10 for the 9 PureView. ==Reception== PC Magazine concluded that the 9 \\"could be the right smartphone for shutterbugs, but there are better options for everyone else\\". Praise was directed towards the design, display and software; Tom's Guide and Digital Trends felt that the RAW-Lightroom integration provided users with significantly more control over photographs. The in-display fingerprint scanner and battery life were both criticized in addition to the loudspeaker's sound quality. Reviewers also noted that the image processing was slow and were disappointed that a camera- oriented phone lacked an SD card slot, especially considering the size of RAW image files. The usage of an older Snapdragon 845 chip also drew some criticism initially as its competitors were using the newer Snapdragon 855 chip. The 9 PureView received an overall score of 85 from DxOMark (matching that of Apple's iPhone 7 and LG's V30), with a photo score of 88 and a video score of 80. DxOMark remarked that \\"[W]ith the possible exception of its Bokeh capability, the Nokia 9 PureView doesn’t deliver either a photo or video performance on a par with other current model phones in its premium price range.\\" In February 2020, the 9 PureView won a Good Design Award 2019. ==Known issues== The phone has a defect that allows it to be unlocked by using a gum in the fingerprint reader.Nokia 9 PureView fingerprint sensor fooled by chewing gum packet ==References== Category:Nokia mobile phones Category:Nokia phones by series Category:Smartphones Category:Mobile phones introduced in 2019 Category:Android (operating system) devices Category:Phones with multiple rear cameras Category:Mobile phones with 4K video recording ","title":"Nokia 9 PureView"},{"id":"60398971","text":"View of the Pozzo del Leoncino The Pozzo del Leoncino (Well of the Small Lion) is 15th-16th century well located in Piazza della Sala in central Pistoia, region of Tuscany, Italy. ==History and Description== It is suspected that this part of town formed part of the ancient forum of the Roman town of Pistoia, but was likely devastated during the Barbarian invasions. Around this piazza were built administrative buildings for the Lombard Kingdom. Nothing remains of those early medieval structures. With the elaboration of the City Hall and bureaucratic offices at the Palazzo degli Anziani in the Piazza del Duomo, this area became a marketplace and site of commerce. The surrounding streets and alleys recall different professions clustering around the piazza. Documents indicated that in the mid-15th century, the commune banned the slaughter of animals in the Piazza, which appeared to have led to the refuse contaminating the well water. The square Renaissance-style arch was designed by Cecchino di Giorgio in 1453. It is decorated with the coats of arms of the Capponi, Ridolfi, Da Diaccetto families, and the emblems of the Operai di San Jacopo, a major public works office. In 1529, atop the architrave, was placed a small lion (thus the name of the well) holding the checkered symbol of Pistoia under its paws. The use of lion, representing the Florentine Marzocco may have been part of an assertion of the Florentine rule over the town, since typically the shield of Pistoia had been upheld by a bear(s).Vivi Pistoia, entry on Pozzo del Leoncino.Comune of Pistoia, short entry on Pozzo.

In March 1945, towards the end of the war, he became commander of the South-Western Marine Defence Region of the Baltic Fleet, with a promotion to vice-admiral on 20 April 1945, and then Chief of Staff of the Southern Baltic Fleet in 1946. ==Postwar career== Vinogradov was appointed commander of the Kamchatka Flotilla in 1946, followed by a posting as Deputy Chief of the Main Naval Staff from 1948 until 1950. In 1950 he became Deputy Secretary of the Navy for Personnel and Naval Educational Institutions, and in 1953 Chief of Weapons and Shipbuilding of the Navy. On 31 May 1954 he was promoted to admiral, and in 1958 he took the post of Deputy Chief of the General Staff of the Army and Navy, followed by Assistant Chief of the General Staff for the Navy in 1961. His final post was in 1962 as Head of the Administration of Naval Educational Institutions, which he held until his retirement in 1968. ==Legacy== Vinogradov's namesake, the Udaloy-class destroyer Admiral Vinogradov, underway in 1992 During his long naval career Vinogradov was awarded two Orders of Lenin, five Orders of the Red Banner, the Order of Ushakov First Class, the Order of the Red Star, and numerous medals and foreign awards. Vinogradov died on 27 April 1979 and was buried at Kuntsevo Cemetery. His memoirs, The Underwater Front (, Podvodnyi front), were published in Moscow in 1989. Vinogradov was honoured with the naming of the Udaloy-class destroyer Admiral Vinogradov, which joined the Pacific Fleet in 1989. A street in Sharya is named after him, and a memorial plaque is located in the school in the Sharyinsky District where he studied. Recalling his wartime relationship with Vinogradov, Admiral Arseniy Golovko, commander of the Northern Fleet from 1940 to 1945, noted that “During the whole period of war, while N. I. Vinogradov was the brigade commander, he correctly supervised the training of submarine crews, and especially their commanders ... I must say that Vinogradov and I understood each other well.” ==Notes== a. It was during this time, in December 1944, that Vinogradov met fellow submarine officer, and future admiral of the fleet, Georgiy Yegorov, then serving in the Baltic as captain of M-90. Yegorov recalled the meeting when contributing a biographical sketch for Vinogradov's memoirs, Podvodnyi front. ==References== Category:1905 births Category:1979 deaths Category:Burials at Kuntsevo Cemetery Category:People from Kostroma Oblast Category:Soviet admirals Category:Soviet historians Category:Russian military writers Category:20th- century historians Category:Soviet military personnel of the Winter War Category:Soviet military personnel of World War II Category:Recipients of the Order of Lenin Category:Recipients of the Order of Ushakov, 1st class Category:Recipients of the Order of the Red Banner Category:N.

Her paintings reflect her Latin American heritage and have been described by critics to be fragments of her dreams and memories. Per Rosado, she was drawn to an unusual sense of beauty and wonder and was intrigued by symbolism in paintings in Catholic churches and contemporary revisions. She is the owner of Casa de Rosado, an art gallery for which she received a City Pulse LGBT Inclusion Award in 2018. == Biography == Theresa Rosado was born in 1965 in St. Louis, Missouri and was raised by a blue collar family of Puerto Rican and Macedonian descent. == Education == Rosado went to Michigan State University studying and graduating with a degree in anthropology. She took additional an additional course in Art history of Mexico taught by Charlene Villasenor Black of UCLA at Michigan State University. She also self taught herself African-American Art History. == Artworks == === On Prom Night I Danced with My Grandmother === On Prom Night I Danced with My Grandmother (1993) pictures three figures who contribute to the Latin American culture hinted in the painting. A female playing the guitar with her companion and a smaller figure dressed in blue under a dome-like structure. This blue figure may represent her grandmother and may be whom the female guitarist is playing and dancing to. The painting is composed of two sections. The upper half of the painting includes a colorful background of pineapples hung across a blue sky, plants along the white wall, a blue and red polka dot dress in the left corner, and the female's companion playing the guitar while dancing along the wall. The bottom portion of the painting consists of the female guitarist in a yellow and red polka dot outfit dancing along the grass in front of the white wall. There are red flowers near the white dome over the small blue figure. The female, her companion, and the small blue figure are placed in a triangular manner within the painting which symbolize unity. === Flying Girl === In Rosado's 1994 Flying Girl she combines surrealism with realism by painting a mansion surrounded by flowers with a girl in a yellow dress flying towards the top of the mansion. According to Robert Henkes, the girl in the yellow dress presents the element of surrealism because if she were not to be in the painting, the scene would look realistic. Within the field of red flowers surrounding the house is a yellow bird, perched on top of one of the flowers near the front of the house. The identical row of windows on the sides of the house remain consistent in size and may be seen in the era of the Italian Renaissance. Because this painting has elements of surrealism, it is difficult to interpret any symbols because it is personal to the artist. === Prayer of a Sun Woman === Prayer of a Sun Woman (1994) presents elements of human life within the centered image of the sunflower woman. The sunflower woman is composed of the sunflower head, a woman's body and legs, and a branching leaves that represent the arms. Circling the branching sunflower woman are birds of multiple colors. Henkes states that behind this abnormal sunflower are normal sunflowers growing vertically from the pink ground. He further states that this sunflower woman overlapping the normal field of normal sunflowers makes the painting more unique as it allows the audience to focus on the sunflower woman. Across the chest of the woman is a flag of Puerto Rico that put emphasis on Rosado's cultural background. === Five Mysteries or More === Five Mysteries or More (1994) contains a variety of components. The painting takes place in a garden of Eden. Within this garden is a blue stream running down from the focal point of a woman's face, four naked woman with their feet in the water besides the stream, which flows down to a clothed woman in a blue dress holding the flags of Rosado's ancestral and native countries, Cuba and the United States of America. All of the woman in the painting are of different races and are connected by an ongoing circle of fruit that tie around their necks. Per Henkes, the painting as a whole is personal to Rosado as it contains many elements or her life that can only be truly and accurately interpreted by Rosado herself. == Exhibitions == Solo Exhibitions * 1995: Casa de Unidad, Detroit, Michigan * 1995: Lansing Art Gallery, Lansing, Michigan * 1996: General Motor Institute, Flint, Michigan Group Exhibitions * 1991: Ella Sharp Museum, Jackson, Michigan * 1992: Northern Michigan University, Marquette, Michigan * 1992: Scarab Gallery, Detroit, Michigan * 1993: Michigan Heritage & Folklore Gallery, Grand Rapids, Michigan * 1994: Krasl Art Center, St. Joseph, Michigan * 1995: Flint Fine Art Gallery, Flint, Michigan * 1995: Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan * 1995: Kresge Art Center, Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan * 1995: Kellogg Center, East Lansing, Michigan == Collections == Rosado's work can be seen in the collections of the Labor Council for Latin American Advancement and the Interfaith Council for Workers Justice. == References == == External links == * Category:1965 births Category:Living people Category:Artists from St. Louis Category:Michigan State University alumni ","title":"Theresa Rosado"},{"id":"60399263","text":"Dorothy Alexander (born Dorothy Sydney Moses; April 22, 1904 – November 17, 1986) was an American ballet dancer, choreographer, teacher, and company director.

Slade is Professor Emeritus at the Vancouver School of Economics at the University of British Columbia and was a council member of the Royal Economic Society from 2004–2008. Slade is best known for her work on Industrial Economics, serving as the President of the European Association for Research in Industrial Economics (EARIE) from 2001–2003. == Education and work == Slade attended Vassar College where she completed her B.A. in Mathematics. She did her M.A. in Mathematics at University of California, Berkeley and her Ph.D in Economics at George Washington University. Her Ph.D thesis focused on the mining industry, in particular Copper-Aluminum Substitution and Recycling. Slade has done influential work in the field of Industrial Organization, in particular popularizing many empirical methodologies and techniques to a field that was extensively theoretical. An example of this is her paper, “Vancouver's Gasoline-Price Wars: An Empirical Exercise in Uncovering Supergame Strategies”, where she pioneered method to study tacit collusion by collecting her own unique data, which is commonplace today but wasn't heard of at the time. Her research interests include manufacturing as well as energy and resource economics, in particular the petroleum and metals industries. In 2001, Slade received an Honorary Doctorate from the Helsinki School of Economics. She served as a Council Member for the Royal Economic Society from 2004 to 2008. In 2014, she was selected as a Fellow at the Canadian Economics Association, the association's highest honour. == Scholarship == === \\"Vancouver's Gasoline-Price Wars: An Empirical Exercise in Uncovering Supergame Strategies\\" === Slade compiled a data set to perform an econometric study to test which dynamic framework best models tacit collusion behavior in the Vancouver retail-gasoline market. The study treats gas station managers as competing economic agents that strategically price their products based on prices from previous periods. The model also considers exogenous demand shocks which force firms to navigate the new market demands and appropriately adjust their pricing strategies. In econometric terms, the slopes of the intertemporal best response functions are hidden variables and thus the resulting system of equations is estimated via Kalman filters. Different oligopoly models can thus be compared relative to each other, with respect to explaining firm behavior in the Vancouver gasoline market. === \\"Multitask Agency and Organizational Form: An Empirical Exploration\\" === In her 1996 paper, \\"Multitask Agency and Organizational Form: An Empirical Exploration,” Slade empirically studies the contracts linking private oil companies and gas stations in Vancouver to study the multitask-agency problem. Slade explains that the multitask-agency problem arises when economic agents partake in many activities, where the characteristics of one task affect the payoff from the others. She utilized econometric methods to study variations in task characteristics to predict corresponding agent-compensation schemes. One of the methods used was comparative statics which lead to the conclusion that firms have incentives to supply gasoline when secondary activity is not strongly complementary with gasoline retailing. The cross price demand elasticities, the covariation in uncertainty and a measure of effort substitutability were some of the parameters that were used to capture complementarity. This empirical analysis remains as one of the few conducted on this particular subject. === \\"Spatial Price Competition: A Semiparametric Approach\\" === Slade et al. examine how price competition plays out among non- homogenous firms in small markets. They use an econometric regression with instrumental variables to measure cross price elasticity coefficients. They prove that the estimators are consistent and asymptotically distributed. This approach allowed them to compare models of global competition, where all firms compete with one another, and local competition, where firms only compete with their respective neighbours. The data used for this study was obtained for U.S. wholesale gasoline markets which mostly have localized competition. === \\"Market Structure, Marketing Method, and Price Instability\\" === Slade used data for metals listed on commodity exchanges by price-setting producers to examine how different organizations of markets are linked to behaviour of prices. On the production side, she focused on how the stability of prices varies in concentrated industries. On the sale side, Slade tested how the stability of prices varies when buyers are only consumers rather than consumers and speculators. These components were combined into an econometric regression, which explains how metal price instability may be affected by changing market structures and organization variables. Slade found there was an increasing reliance on commodity exchanges and that the link with declines in concentration was weak. == Awards == * Honorary Doctorate, Helsinki School of Economics, 2001 * President of the European Association for Research in Industrial Economics, 2001-2003 * Holder of the inaugural Leverhulme Professorship in Industrial Economics at the University of Warwick, 2002-2007 * Killam Research Prize, 1993 * Fellow, Canadian Economics Association, elected 2014 == Selected works == * Pinkse, J., Slade, M., & Brett, C.

The riots occurred after a black man shot and killed a white policeman and ultimately resulted in 12 deaths. On July 3, an African-American man named Lee Brown, aka Robert Lee, had a dispute with another African-American man, Tom Berry, at a bar and attempted to return to the bar with a gun but was stopped by Louis N. Massey, the most senior policeman on the force. Massey attempted to arrest Brown but Brown shot and fatally wounded Massey, however Massey was able to fire back before dying, wounding Brown who eventually succumbed to injuries as well on July 31. A mob of several thousand citizens (mostly all white) formed outside the Vanderburgh County Jail on July 6 and attempted to storm the jail with the intention of lynching Brown and 16 other black inmates. Around 200 militiamen then opened fire on the mob, killing and injuring several rioters. The crowd then began looting hardware stores of weapons and stormed into black neighborhoods in an attempt to expel blacks from Evansville. The rioting continued until July 10 and a total of 12 people died during the riot, with more than 40 others seriously wounded and about 2,000 of Evansville's 8,000 black residents fleeing the city. It is unclear as to whether the mob or the militia were to blame for the deaths. Several accounts describe the escalation as coming to a head after a rock was thrown by someone in the crowd, at the militia, who in turn fired warning shots which caused chaos.

The contamination came from an Inco Ltd. refinery that was in commission between 1918-1984 . This class action lawsuit initially started in 2002, but did not go to trial until 2010.

He wrote a three-part Herbal in which he described the medicinal properties of plants. He produced a second, popular edition with colour images, in which the plants were arranged in alphabetical order. This is the first known Herbal to have included images of the plants and was the model for very many later works of the same sort. To date, only two papyrus fragments of this work are known.Die Botanik in der Antike. Pliny the Elder records that Crateuas painted images of the plants and listed their effects below the images.Naturalis historia, 25, 8.Arzneimittellehre des Dioskurides. Crateuas' book was one of the main sources for Pedanius Dioscorides. In some of the tables of the \\"Vienna Dioscurides\\", the images are captioned by short texts beginning with the name of Crateuas. An image taken from Crateuas is found in Table 3 of the Vienna Dioscurides.Maria Przybylo: Dioskurides: De materia medica. In the 16th century, an illustrated manuscript of Crateuas is said to have still existed in Constantinople.

It supports the British Army and the Brigade of Gurkhas in ceremonial settings, pass off parades, concerts and many other musical support tasks. It is a directly reporting unit of Regional Bands HQ (RBANDS) under London District, which sponsors the promotion of British military music. It is one of two 'Light Pace' regular wind bands in the British Army. (the other being the Band and Bugles of The Rifles). The band has travelled extensively since its inception, travelling more recently to The Falkland Islands, Australia, Brunei, Canada, France, Germany, Nepal, Belgium. Today, musicians from Nepal are chosen during their Gurkha military training. Their musical instruction commences first under Director of Music (DOM) and then under supervision of the Royal Military School of Music. ==History== The band during the Royal Edinburgh Military Tattoo in 2010. The band was raised in November 1859 as part the Sirmoor Rifle Regiment, originally consisting of 16 Bandsmen and one with the rank of Naik who serves as bandmaster. Certain changes in 1886 (such as the raising of a new 2nd Battalion) allowed for an expansion of the existing band. The two bands often cooperated with each other in both of their musical and operational duties (bandsmen also served as stretcher bearers and medical personnel on the battlefield). The army sanctioned the training of a new band in 1949, with 56 recruits beginning their army service. Within a year of that decision, a brigade staff band was established, leaving the unit with two separate military bands. At the time, ad hoc instruction and education was given by British bandmasters and acclaimed musicians of working for the army, which would end in May 1951. The two bands routine continued for over a decade until the two bands were amalgamated because of financial considerations. Although they served as a combined band, the two bands remained separately in the United Kingdom and Hong Kong to support their respective battalions in the 70s and 80s, until the 2nd Battalion initiated their withdraw from the region in 1994. ==Pipe band== The 1st and 2nd Battalions, Royal Gurkha Rifles currently maintain pipe bands as part of the band.

The culms, or stems of the grass are to in height and branching at the nodes. The nodes are purplish and hairless. The leaves of the plant are basal and on the stems. The leaf is hairless and when crushed gives off a lemon-ginger scent like other grasses in the genus Cymbopogon. The inflorescence of the plant, or the collections of flowers, are arranged on a long stem with clusters of short, nearly hairless branches which bend downwards when mature, giving the inflorescence a barbed- wire appearance. The spikelets are paired, one stalked the other unstalked. Flowering mostly spring to autumn. ==Taxonomy== Cymbopogon refractus was first described by R. Brown in 1810 as Andropogon refractus, but in 1921 was placed in the genus Cymbopogon by Camus. ==Habitat and ecology== Cymbopogon refractus is widespread on poor soils of roadsides, native pastures, woodlands and forests of Queensland, New South Wales, the Northern Territory, and Victoria.

She is a water protector and has been called a \\"water warrior\\". In 2018, at the age of thirteen, Peltier addressed world leaders at the UN General Assembly on the issue of water protection. == Early life == Peltier lives on Lake Huron, one of the largest groups of freshwater lakes on Earth. She comes from the territory of Wikwemkoong, a First Nations reserve. Currently, she lives in Ottawa and attended St. Mother Teresa High School. Peltier grew up understanding the importance of water and the need to protect it. She also advocates for the universal right to clean drinking water, raising awareness towards water rights and ensuring communities have access to clean, safe and reliable drinking water. As young as the age of 8, Peltier was attending water ceremonies on First Nation reserves. She continues her work for the access of clean water concerning Indigenous peoples across the world (\\"Autumn Peltier\\" 2020). == Water advocacy == Peltier gained national and international notice when, at a meeting of the Assembly of First Nations, she presented Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau with a copper water pot and, although she did not have time to deliver her prepared speech, she confronted Trudeau on his record on water protection and his support for pipelines. Her act inspired the Assembly of First Nations to create the Niabi Odacidae fund. She has attended international events such as the Children's Climate Conference in Sweden. In April 2019, Peltier was named the chief water commissioner by the Anishinabek Nation. This position was previously held by her great-aunt, Josephine Mandamin.

Peltier expressed her concern about the lack of safe drinking water in various Indigenous communities across Canada, especially from Trudeau's support of pipelines as mentioned above. Peltier further gained attention when she spoke at The Global Landscapes Forum in New York City in September 2018, where she addressed the United Nations and important decision-makers (Zettler, 2019). This conference also allowed her to further spread awareness around the world for her cause and spark a change. She uses various platforms such as Facebook and Instagram, where she has over 100 thousand followers, to spread her water advocacy (Zettler, 2019). Overall, she has been receiving vast amounts of support from youth, politicians, and other activists. She has contributed greatly to bringing attention to the issues of the absence of clean drinking water in indigenous communities. == Awards and recognition == * Nominated for the International Children's Peace Prize, 2017, 2018, 2019. * Canadian Living Me to We Award Youth in Action under 12, 2017. *Ontario Junior Citizens Award, Ontario Newspaper Association, 2017. *Sovereign Medal of Exceptional Volunteerism, by Governor General of Canada and Lieutenant Governor Of Ontario, March 2017 *Ottawa Riverkeeper Award, 2018. * Water Warrior Award at the Water Docs Film Festival in Toronto, 2019. *Young Leader Award, Ontario Municipal Social Services Association Award, 2019. *Named Top 30 under 30 in North America for Environmental Education making a difference, 2019. *Named to the BBC 100 Women list for 2019. *Named to Maclean's list of 20 to Watch in 2020. *Named to Huffington Post's list of 15 Canadian Icons Who Stole our Hearts in 2019. *Named to the Union of Concerned Scientists list of 2019 Science Defenders. *Named as a Chatelaine 2019 Woman of the Year. == References == Category:Living people Category:2004 births Category:Anishinaabe people Category:Canadian child activists Category:Canadian women environmentalists Category:Canadian environmentalists Category:First Nations activists Category:First Nations women Category:People from Manitoulin Island Category:BBC 100 Women ","title":"Autumn Peltier"},{"id":"60400266","text":"The 1932 Marquette Golden Avalanche football team was an American football team that represented Marquette University as an independent during the 1932 college football season.

The Waitemata Group is an Early Miocene geologic group that is exposed in and around the Auckland Region of New Zealand, between the Whangarei Harbour in the North and the Raglan Harbour in the South. The Group is predominantly composed of deep water sandstone and mudstone (flysch). The sandstone dominated units form the cliffs around the Waitemata Harbour and rare more resistant conglomerates underlie some of Auckland's prominent ridges. == Sub-units and deposition == The Waitemata Group was deposited within fault controlled basins. These were bounded to the North and South by up faulted Mesozoic basement sedimentary rocks and volcanic rocks to the East and West. The sedimentary source for the Group's sandstone is a mix of these basement sediments of the Waipapa Terrane and the mostly intermediate volcanic rocks. The maximum water depth of the Waitemata Group basin basin was 2,000 m. The basal strata (Kawau Subgroup) are from the early Miocene (Otaian) and range in thickness from 10–45 m. These basal lithologies are varied and different from the overlying flyish basin. They overly the Te Kuiti Group sediments and the Mesozoic basement. This subgroup includes the Papakura Limestone, Tipakuri Sandstone Formation and the Cape Rodney Formation (greywacke conglomerate and breccia). The Warkworth Subgroup is up to 1000m of inter-bedded sandstone and mudstone formed from turbidity currents. These accumulated in a bathyal submarine fan. The Meremere Subgroup is finer grained and represents a bathyal submarine fan and basin floor facies.Edbrooke 2001, Geology of the Auckland area P.24-25 The Waitemata Group is overlain by the volcanic and volcaniclastic Waitakere Group.Edbrooke 2001, Geology of the Auckland area P.29 == Paleontology == The Group was once thought to extend from the Oligocene to the Early Miocene, however it is now confined exclusively to the Early Miocene.Edbrooke 2001, Geology of the Auckland area P.23 In the shallow water Kawau Subgroup at least 84 taxa have been identified, half of which were molluscs, however, corals and brachiopods were also found. The environment was inferred to be a rocky shore. Nereites facies trace fossils are common throughout the deeper water sequence. == Deformation == The Waitemata Group formed during the emplacement of the Northland Allochthon and is sometimes inter-bedded with it. The Allochthon continued to move South during deposition and some areas of the Waitemata Group are therefore extensively deformed. == Geotechnical properties == The Waitemata Group forms steep rapidly eroding cliffs and it is recommended that building should be avoided near them.Edbrooke 2001, Geology of the Auckland area P.63 Landslides are commonly caused by bedding plan failure in weathered Waitemata Group sedimentary rock.

The work she presented was on abstraction with references to real spaces. == Biography == Margarita Morselli was born in Asunción, Paraguay on 8 January 1952. She is an artist whose paintings were described as architecture where she used mineral tones such as shades of ocher, orange and blue. Her technique usually involves paint brushing and airbrushing. One of the recurring theme is the centralization of stairs. She often heeds or disrupts the form of the stairs by creating the illusion of perforating the two-dimensionally of the canvas. This type of technique creates an uncertain and seemingly useless space. Her more recent work addresses environmental concerns including vegetables forms and animals that, as figurative elements, create a certain tension in relation to her abstractions. She also designed costumes for theater and dance pieces. She was later invited to represent her country by participating in the 18th São Paulo Biennial (1985) which was her first one- woman exhibition in the U.S. She was also invited at the 1st Art Biennial at Canning House, London(1987) and at the 3rd Biennial of Cuenca, Ecuador(1992). She is a permanent member of the Centro Cultural de la República and president of the International Art Biennal, both in Asunción. Morselli teaches at the \\"Instituto para el Desarrollo Armónico de la Personalidad\\" (IDAP). She is a founding member of Gente de Arte which is an association of Paraguayan artists and cultural. == Education == Morselli has a degree in music education, specifically for piano. She also has a degree from the\\" Universidad Nacional de Paraguay School of Law\\". In the Instituto para el Desarrollo Armónico de la Personalidad (IDAP), Morselli attended art classes with Olga Blinder (1939–2008). With the Brazilian professor Livío Abramo, she studied art history in Escolinha de Arte and she was able to enter upon an active professional career, winning rapid recognition as a leading figure in the new generation of Paraguayan artists. At the Instituo Superior de Bella Artes in Asunción, she studied aesthetics with Dorothée Bauerle-Willert and with Michael Krueger she learned about printmaking and printing. == Artworks == === Autorretrato, 1952=== Medium= Morselli started out with a self portrait, a video of twenty two minutes in color and it contains sound. Objective= Dealt with the tension experienced by a woman endlessly climbing a flight of stairs. Description=This work could be interpreted into two different ways which were as a commentary on the seemly endless dictatorship in Paraguay of Alfredo Stroessner (1954–89); second, as an interrogation of female subjectivity moving upward as it searches for a way out or a response of a vague questions. Her work was described as well oriented that constituted a significant presence among painters of the younger generation. It was also seen as very mysterious, which led to her paintings having a lot of strange meanings attached to them. === ESCALERA VI, 1985 === Medium = Mixed media on canvas. Description = A set of stairs from which water trickles. === Others === Morselli has other paintings such as the ones listed below, but very few if any descriptions of them. * DECONSTRUCCIÓN, 1992 * DE LA SERIE SOMOS, 1997 * EL PESCADOR ESCONDIDO PRIMAVERA AZUL, 1992 * SIN TÍTULO, 1999 * PAISAJE ENCENDIDO == Exhibitions == === Solo exhibitions === Morselli was able to start her first solo show in 1982, at the Galería Arte-Sanos, Asunción. * 1982 Pinturas, Galería Arte-Sanos, Asunción, Paraguay * 1987 Margarita Morselli of Paraguay: Paintings, Museum of Modern Art of Latin America, Washington DC * 1991 Derrumbe, Galería Arte-Sanos, Asunción, Paraguay * 1991 Mon repos, Casa Hassler, San Bernardino, Paraguay * 2004 Punto de mira, Casa Hassler, San Bernardino, Paraguay * 2005 - \\"PUNTO DE MIRA\\", Extensión cultural de la UNAM, Canadá * 2006 - Muestra individual en la embajada paraguaya en París, Francia * 2009 - \\"PUNTO DE MIRA\\", Muestra Etnia ELA.

As she was the only one among the emperor's consorts to hold that rank, she did not receive a title to distinguish her from the other consorts. She gave birth on 28 November 1683 to the emperor's tenth son, Yun'e, and on 24 October 1685 to his 11th daughter, who would die prematurely in June or July 1686.

In an interview with The Masters Review, Link explains that when writing she often thinks about the conventions of storytelling, which allows her to mix so many different genres within her stories. For her writing, there is no \\"real\\" or unreal\\" elements when developing stories. Link has also stated that her stories are not written to fit specific themes and that many of her stories were written for different editors for previous publications.

The project involves students placing stickers on their driver's licenses, student ID's, or phones that states their wishes to have the graphic photos of their bodies publicized if they die in a shooting. The project launched on March 27, 2019, less than one month before the 20th anniversary of the Columbine Shooting which took place on April 20, 1999. == Participation == A student identification card with the #MyLastShot sticker applied to it. The project's website states that #MyLastShot is an 'open-source gun violence prevention resource' and that groups wanting to use their sticker or any of their campaign materials are welcome to do so without having to ask permission. As of August 2019, #MyLastShot claims to have sent out nearly 65,000 stickers to students and activists across the nation. == Responses == While many applauded the students efforts, there were also many who opposed the need to show graphic images, in the fear that these photos might further desensitize a nation that has not changed its position on gun-control in decades. === Responses From Elected Officials === On March 28, Senator Julie Gonzales (D), Colorado, referenced #MyLastShot in her speech before voting 'yes' on the Colorado Extreme Risk Protection Orders bill that passed 18–17 in the state senate. In her speech, Sen. Gonzales said, \\"Current high school students from Columbine High have created a website called mylastshot.org where they are asking fellow students to put a sticker on the back of their driver licenses to let the media and others know that if they die in a mass shooting, that they want the photos of their death to be publicized.\\" Colorado State Representative Tom Sullivan also threw in his support of #MyLastShot in light of his own son's tragic murder in the Aurora theatre shooting. He went on to state that people need to see the photos, and that he keeps the graphic images of his son's crime scene photos on his phone to show legislators in an effort to create change. In an interview with Denver7 on the #MyLastShot Project, Rep. Sullivan said, \\"Alex was only shot one time. It came in from his left side. He's lying on the floor in floor 12. He was wearing khaki pants and a red shirt. The impact of our story, once you hear it over and over again, is that it wasn’t fazing anybody,” Sullivan said. “Maybe they need to see some of these pictures.\\" === #MyLastShot vs. Media Ethics === On March 28, 2019, Denver7 News reported on #MyLastShot pointing out how the Poynter Institute for Media Ethics typically is against the release of graphic imagery. On their website under 'Best Practices Offered For Media Coverage of Mass Shootings' they state \\"Be sensitive and cautious about using visual images, rather than showing graphic images of the crime scene.\\" However, about one week after launch, Al Tompkins of the Poynter Institute wrote an article about the #MyLastShot Project giving journalists and photographers guidelines should they come upon the body of an individual with a #MyLastShot pledge. In the article, Al Tompkins writes, \\"...the use of such images is situational and should not be covered by a blanket “never publish” or “always publish” policy that allows journalists to escape tough calls.\\" This stance goes contrary to Poynter's previous guidelines to stay away from showing graphic images of the crime scene. In the same week, another large media ethics institution, Reynolds Journalism Institute gave journalist Jim MacMillan a one-year grant to create new guidelines for gun violence reporting in the United States. ==References== Category:Gun violence in the United States Category:Gun violence ","title":"MyLastShot Project"},{"id":"60400687","text":"Nekhayka () is a rural locality (a village) in Dobryansky District, Perm Krai, Russia.

Starks (March 10, 1866 – April 3, 1908) was an African American community leader who achieved national prominence through his leadership in the fraternal order the Knights of Pythias. Starks was the first African American to serve as a state librarian when he was appointed as the West Virginia state librarian in 1901. ==Life and career== Samuel W. Starks was born and raised in Charleston, West Virginia. As a child, he worked as an apprentice to a cooper. He held a number of jobs as a young man, including clerk and telegraph operator for multiple railroads, manager of a mercantile, and manager of the Advocate Publishing Company. Starks attended the Bryant & Stratton Business College in Chicago, Illinois to study stenography and bookkeeping. He organized a number of business ventures in West Virginia and Ohio and was active in West Virginia politics, fighting against efforts to institute racial segregation in the state's public transportation services. Starks was best known outside of West Virginia for his work in the fraternal order the Knights of Pythias. He helped found the Capitol City Lodge No. 1 in Charleston, and served for sixteen years as the grand chancellor of the state's black Pythians order. He was elected to the Knights of Pythias's highest national office, supreme chancellor, in 1897. While Starks led the organization, its national membership grew from 9,000 to nearly 150,000, including adding 38,000 to the group's women's department, the Order of Calanthe. Starks encouraged members to pool their money to assist black business owners and entrepreneurs in purchasing property; the organization started the Pythian Mutual Investment Association for this purpose in 1902, and Starks served in the role of president of the association. In 1901 West Virginia Governor Albert Blakeslee White appointed Starks to serve as the state librarian, the first African-American to serve as a state librarian. He was reappointed by the following governor, William M. O. Dawson, and served in this role until his death. Starks died in Charleston on April 3, 1908. Governor Dawson spoke at his funeral, which thousands of people attended. He was buried in Spring Hill Cemetery in Charleston, and in 1911 the Knights of Pythias erected a 32-foot granite memorial at his gravesite. ==Legacy== The Samuel Starks House was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1992. ==References== Category:African-American librarians Category:American librarians Category:1866 births Category:1908 deaths Category:People from Charleston, West Virginia ","title":"Samuel W.

Sri Lanka experienced rolling blackouts for three to five hours per day except on Sundays in all parts of the island nation at different time schedules that started from 24 March 2019 to present. This is regarded as one of the worst blackouts confronted in Sri Lanka since 2016 and the longest ever blackout recorded in history of the country. However it was revealed that the main electricity providing institution Ceylon Electricity Board had restricted the power supply to almost all regions of the country without proper prior notice and implemented a time schedule unofficially from 24 March 2019. However the Ministry of Power and Renewable Energy revealed that it didn't grant and approve permission to CEB to impose power cuts. Sri Lankan president Maithripala Sirisena ordered the authorities to take necessary action and remedies to solve the interrupted power supply issue. The Ceylon Electricity Board was widely criticised for its unauthorized action to limit power supply without any public notice and it was alleged that power crisis resulted due to the inabilities and inefficiencies of the CEB in implementing long term plans regarding the supply of electricity. The Sri Lankan Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and the minister of Power and Renewable Energy Ravi Karunanayake issued a notice that the temporal power cut crisis will be solved before Sinhalese New Year and Puthandu which falls on 13th and 14th of April 2019. According to the statements claimed by the Power and Energy minister earlier, the power cuts were removed as of 10 April 2019 and further assured that the electricity bills will not be increased and further charges won't be incurred from the public. The Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka filed a court case against Ceylon Electricity Board at the Fort Magistrate's Court following the power crisis and the court issued a petition to the officials of CEB to be summoned before 9 April. However the Court ordered the CEB to be summoned before 16 April. == Background == Sri Lanka is one of the nations which solely depend upon the electricity in the form of hydroelectricity which is produced using water without having suitable alternative means of provision of electricity during drought and other emergency issues. There were concerns from the pressure groups in Sri Lanka to conserve water and to use renewable energy sources such as solar energy and tidal waves to generate electricity. During late March, the CEB decided to impose four-hour rolling power cut on a scheduled basis throughout Sri Lanka after the national grid capacity failed to meet the increased demand for power due to dry climate, and due to limited power generation. Though the situation isn't new to public, this was the first blackout situation recorded in Sri Lanka in a continuous manner exceeding over 20 days and also the first time CEB imposed a routine daily regular power cuts since 2016. The average annual peak demand of electricity in the country amounts to 2400 MW but during the power outage situation, the overall supply was just around 1950 MW. == Effects == As of 24 March 2019, general public faced severe problems regarding the underprovision of power supply to all parts of the country including the main commercial hub Colombo, except for Galle and the capital city Sri Jayawardenepura Kotte, where the parliament is located. Schools, hospitals, restaurants, businesses and the residents residing at their homes were severely affected due to the power cuts which were not properly disclosed by the CEB before implementation. The power cuts were practiced by Ceylon Electricity Board stating that the decline in water levels in most of the dams across the country have prompted them to do so. The experts also revealed that the current blackout issue will also cause negative impacts to already weakening Sri Lankan economy which faced a downfall in 2018 due to political coup which stormed during 26 October. The government officials including Ravi Karunanayake and CEB were highly backlashed over the unethical illegal actions to reduce power supply throughout the country. PUCSL threatened the CEB for a court case insisting that the power cuts were illegal. CEB was ordered to appear before the court on April 09 by the Colombo Fort Magistrate's Court after PUCSL (Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka) filed a legal action regarding the power crisis. == See also == Electricity sector in Sri Lanka 2020 Sri Lankan blackouts == References == Sri Lanka, 2019 Category:2019 in Sri Lanka Category:Electric power in Sri Lanka ","title":"2019 Sri Lanka electricity crisis"},{"id":"60400767","text":"Jersey Devil is the sixth studio album by American musician Matt Mondanile under his pseudonym Ducktails.

She was born with a rare form of dwarfism. ==Career== Newbold has worked in the White House during four presidential administrations, beginning with the Clinton administration in 2000. She eventually took on the role of adjudications manager in the White House, in which capacity she has had to determine whether certain presidential employees should be granted security clearances. In addition to the Clinton and Trump administrations, she also worked under Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama. ==Security clearance controversy== In January 2019, Newbold was suspended for fourteen days without pay for refusing to cooperate with procedures implemented by her supervisor. She has alleged that this suspension was made in retaliation for attempting to express her concerns about the granting of security clearances by her office. In March 2019, Newbold spoke privately to the House Oversight Committee, claiming that at least 25 Trump administration officials were granted security clearances over the objections of career staffers. Newbold also asserted that some of these officials had previously had their applications rejected for \\"disqualifying issues\\", only for those rejections to be overturned with inadequate explanation. On April 1, 2019, Elijah Cummings, the Committee chair, released a letter detailing Newbold's accusations. In a subsequent interview with NBC News, she accused her former boss, Carl Kline, of embarrassing her by moving files to high locations where she could not reach them.

This action led to a new ultras group wanting to fill the void. During the infamous FC FCSB - Manchester City 2016 match, Dinamo Bucharest ultras successfully tricked home fans of FC FCSB to wear their colors and a message saying Doar Dinamo Bucuresti (Only Dinamo Bucharest).Former members of Peluza Nord and other fans wanted to take revenge and founded a new ultras group. == Peluza Roş-Albastră's stance over the identity dispute == Unlike most Peluza Nord and Peluza Sud members who are either neutral or take the side of CSA Steaua Bucharest, Peluza Ros-Albastra support FCSB in this dispute, claiming it is the historical team that was founded on 7 June 2003 and has all the history and trophies. Because of this divergence in opinion, the ultras and fans alike are on two opposite sides. One side is claiming that CSA Steaua Bucharest is the true successor of the legendary team, the other claim it is FCSB. Even with this on-going dispute over identity, FCSB still enjoys huge popularity, remaining among the biggest football clubs in the country. == Controversies == Peluza Roş-Albastră had its fair share of controversies from being accused of getting paid by owner Gigi Becali,tricking their supporters to pay an extra fee for tickets to fund a choreography that was never shown and disputes between smaller ultras groups over the control of the stand. During a November 2018 derby between FCSB and Dinamo Bucharest, Peluza Roş-Albastră asked fans to pay an extra 5 lei for a supposed choreography ahead of the big derby. During the game, the ultras only showed a few banners. Many fans felt robbed and wondered where the money went. Ultras group Old Fans was one of the few organized groups within Peluza Roş- Albastră alongside Renegades. Because of a dispute over the leadership of the stand, the Old Fans group chose to leave the stand and participate in home games by staying in the tribune or Peluza I of the stadium instead of Peluza II. During a 2017 clash between FCSB and FC Viktoria Plzen, the two groups stood on opposite sides of the stadium. This didn't last long since Old Fans didn't enjoy huge popularity and slowly faded. After owner Gigi Becali praised rival fans of Dinamo Bucharest and made public statements about missing the old Ultras groups of Peluza Nord and Peluza Sud, Peluza Roş-Albastră chose to organize a protest against the owner and club by not attending either home or away games. The conflict was settled once the owner apologized for his comments. == Fanbase and groups == Peluza Roş-Albastră consists of a handful of organized groups, Oltenita mereu prezenti and Tinerii tin viu fenomenul. Various groups such as Smokers,Old Fans,Renegades and Elite 47 either dissolved or stopped attending matches. Most fans buying tickets in Peluza Roş-Albastră's stand are casual fans. Because of the confusion during this dispute of identity,some ultras from various old-school brigades chose to attend FCSB games and show support.During away games, the team enjoys huge support from fans across the country, usually filling the stadium since the majority consider this team to be the real Steaua Bucharest. == Dissolution in 2020 == After Gheorge Mustata,one of the leadears from Peluza Nord was released from jail in 2020,he returned to FCSB and declared that Peluza Nord is back.Peluza Ros Albastra was dissolved and a new group arose by the name of \\"Tornado 47\\" __INDEX__ ==References== Category:Association football supporters' associations ","title":"Peluza Roș-Albastră"},{"id":"60401047","text":"The 1917 Marquette Golden Avalanche football team was an American football team that represented Marquette University as an independent during the 1917 college football season.

His research focuses on corpus linguistics, critical discourse analysis, corpus-assisted discourse studies and language and identity. He is renowned for his research on the language of Polari. == Career == On 8 November 2003, Scott Simon interviewed Baker on the language of Polari on the National Public Radio. Since its creation in 2006, Baker has been the commissioning editor of the journal Corpora. On 24 May 2010, Baker's article, Polari, a vibrant language born out of prejudice, was published in The Guardian on the language of Polari. Baker said that \\"I love Polari, but hopefully, the narrow-minded social conditions that led to its creation will never require anything like it to happen in this country again.\\" In an article, published on 27 July 2017 on BBC, Paul Baker said that \\"Layering upon layering of different influences ensures that there is no one single version of Polari but many versions and Polari has its own vocabulary for elements that mainstream society is not interested in.\\" On 6 November 2017 Baker was accepted as a Fellow of the Royal Society for the encouragement of Arts, Manufactures and Commerce (RSA). In 2018 he received a staff award for work on the language of Polari and its contribution to uncovering and highlighting LGBT heritage. In July 2019 he gave a speech about bias in the press at the British Parliament at the launch of the Centre for Media Monitoring. ==Research== His PhD thesis was published in a book entitled Polari - The Lost Language of Gay Men (2002). A later book, Fabulosa (2019) updated the research for a non-academic audience. Baker regularly runs workshops in Polari at the Bishopsgate Institute, London. His research focuses on corpus linguistics, language and identity, and critical discourse analysis. A Polari exhibition at the John Rylands Library, Manchester used Paul Baker's research. The Polari Mission was a multi- disciplinary collaboration between artists and specialists in the fields of linguistics and computer science including Baker and Tim Greening-Jackson. The aim was to raise awareness about Polari, one of the world’s most endangered languages, a bold yet secretive part of Gay history. In 2017 Baker's research on change in British and American English was reported in the Telegraph, Guardian and Mail. Baker noted how gradable adverbs like quite, rather and fairly have dramatically decreased in British English over the period 1931-2006, a phenomenon which seems to follow American English, which is more advanced. In 2019, Baker's research on patient feedback on the National Health Service was reported in the Mail, Independent and Metro. ==Publications== Baker has published over 30 articles in journals such as Discourse and Society, Journal of English Linguistics, Language Learning and Technology, Journal of Language and Politics, and Applied Linguistics.

Such paintings were very popular in Germany at the time. He also collaborated with Wilhelm Schubert van Ehrenberg, adding animals to his landscapes.Biographical notes @ the Getty Museum. After moving to Italy, around 1672, he turned to painting sacred subjects, beginning with decorations for the choir at the Church of Sant'Eusebio in Rome. He eventually settled in L'Aquila, impressed by the rite of the (Celestinian Forgiveness), which was instituted by Pope Celestine V in the 13th century. So much so, that he became a Celestine monk and took the name Frà Andrea. He would spend the rest of his life in the convent at the Basilica of Santa Maria di Collemaggio.

She was the second of six children of Rath and his wife Anna Jörris, van Mettmann. Anna spent her first seven years on the Otjimbingwe mission. In October 1858, Anna, her five siblings, and parents traveled by ship from Walvis Bay to Cape Town, where the two oldest (Anna and Emma) were to board at the Rhenish Institute (now the Rhenish Girls' High School. On the family's return voyage on April 1, 1859, Anna and Emma's mother and four siblings died in a shipwreck. Only their father survived, and wrote a letter to his two daughters in Stellenbosch, encouraging them to be brave. He compared their mother's suffering to Christ's on the cross. To comfort them, he relayed her telling him a short while before her death that she \\"was not wholly uneasy,\\" and reminded them that even Jesus, for his part, felt compelled to cry out 'My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?' (Matthew 27:45). == Career == Anna taught school from 1882 to 1898 in Sarepta. In July 1882, Anna Rath took over the school in Sarepta, where her father had moved, with the young Maria Thomas as her assistant. The schoolhouse with its clay floor was already dilapidated. In October 1890, Anna informed the superintendent-general of education, Dr. Langham Dale, that the Cape government had not earmarked any funds for building schools, and her father accordingly took the lead, spearheading the demolition of the school to rebuild a new one that December. Local farmers and other community members each donated 500 or more bricks so the school, consisting of two classrooms, could open Easter Monday, March 30, 1891. Anna also worked in Amaliënstein, a mission of the Berlin Missionary Society 22 km east of Ladysmith, KwaZulu- Natal, and at the nearby Zoar, Western Cape, operated by the South African Missionary Society. In both places, she educated the mission employees' children, but sources are unclear as to whether she taught in both simultaneously or consecutively. Perhaps she worked at both missions before moving to Sarepta, since at the time (1882), she was already 30 or 31. == Married life == In November 1898, at the age of 47, she first married the 60-year-old Rev. Jacobus Pauw, a widower with 12 children. Anna moved to Wellington, Western Cape, where her father lived in the town rectory; he died in 1903, while visiting his elder daughter, and was buried in Sarepta. Anna's husband, the Rev. Pauw, retired as a minister in the NGK in 1910 to a £100 stipend (in the days before pensions). In 1913, he also retired as a docent at the Missionary Institute, and he died on June 13, 1918. Anna survived him by about 22 years, and wrote a biography of him that was published in 1943, three years after her death. == Sources == * (af) Krüger, Prof. D.W. and Beyers, C.J. (ed.)

His philanthropic process is one of taking up relevant projects only after fully understanding the needs of the local community. This is followed by executing the project in the minimum amount of time while meeting all the set goals. Once the project is completed, he sets long-term goals for local community members to ensure that the project delivers the right results for the maximum amount of time. Every project is handheld for a brief period of time until it starts producing the desired results. Instead of keeping it as a one-way monologue, he believes in fully engaging with the local stakeholders to increase the projects' viability, effectiveness, sustainability, and overall reach. == References == Category:Living people Category:Indian billionaires Category:1953 births ","title":"Ravishankar Dakoju"},{"id":"60401497","text":"Danae Kyriakopoulou is a Greek economist who is currently the Official Monetary and Financial Institutions Forum (OMFIF)'s Chief Economist and Director of Research. Kyriakopoulou is the head of OMFIF's economic staff, providing leadership and direction in the economic research agenda. She is fluent in English, German, Greek, and Spanish. Kyriakopoulou is a macroeconomist who often is asked to speaker and contributor for international publications, conferences and the media. ==Biography== Danae Kyriakopoulou was raised in Athens, Greece and after went to the United Kingdom, where she earned her BA in Philosophy, Politics and Economics as well as an MSc in Economics for Development at the University of Oxford. Kyriakopoulou received two Principal's Collection Prize for two of her papers in Oxford; One was for her econometric paper and the second was for her microeconomics paper. She is fluent in English, German, Greek, and Spanish. Kyriakopoulou went on to work for the Bank of Greece in 2013 as an Economist. She moved back to the UK later in 2013 and got a position as a Senior Economist at the Centre for Economics and Business Research (CEBR), in London. From May to December 2015 Kyriakopoulou took a short position as a Senior Economic Adviser, at the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, while still working at CEBR. Following her short position, Kyriakopoulou was promoted at CEBR, to managing economist. In 2016 Kyriakopoulou became the Chief Economist and Director of Research for OMFIF. ==Research== Danae Kyriakopoulou's research interests focus on macroeconomics, including the European economy, green finance, and development economics. ===European economy=== Danae Kyriakopoulou is a Greek economist based in London and has research and knowledge on the European Union, specifically the Eurozone. She has personal experience and insight on events such as Brexit and the Greek debt crisis. Kyriakopoulou research on her home country, the Greek debt crisis held no bias but viewed the events and the bailout in a critical manner. While Greece's third bailout had the country and the rest of Europe optimist Kyriakopoulou dives into deeper research of the economic reality surrounding Greece and the Eurozone. There is evidence of economic growth in Greece in 2017, with a decrease in the unemployment rate as well as the budget and account deficit. Kyriakopoulou states the problem is that the Greek economy had lost more than a quarter of its GDP over the decade long recession. With the European Union and the European Stability Mechanism, Greece will have a financial buffer for the next few years but what happens after? Kyriakopoulou analyses political environment and events; such as the United States' trade war with China and the 2019 European Parliament elections. ===Green economy and green finance=== Danae Kyriakopoulou has focused a lot on the research of green finance and the green economy. Climate change has become a growing political issue that Kyriakopoulou recognizes, affects everyone globally. The financial sector is also concerned with climate change and the risks that come with it. These risks and natural disasters devastate many people, damaging infrastructure and the economy; if it is insured this will result in higher claims which will ultimately fall on households. Kyriakopoulou suggests changes in climate policy, technology or investment must be the first step in reaching the global climate goal of keeping the rise in temperature to less than 2 degrees Celsius. Greening central banks and the financial system would be investing in green initiatives and technology. OMFIF along with organizations like the Bank for International Settlements, German finance ministry, DZ BANK, HSBC and other institutions created, 'Focus on green finance' initiative. 'Central Banks and Supervisors Network for Greening the Financial System' was created, focusing on central banks and IGOs. Kyriakopoulou has gathered research and evidence proving central banks are moving past the analytical theory-based framework connected with climate change to their mandates and policy to these organizations stepping up and taking action. ==Media== Danae Kyriakopoulou is asked to speak and contribute to many various media sources, from news to journals and even her impactful Twitter presence. She has interviews on CNN and CNBC to name a few news sources that can be found on YouTube. She was on the 2016 'Business Insider's List of 36 best European Economist to follow on Twitter.' She has a strong presence in economic matters in many forms of global media, especially with the rapid political and economic shifts in global governance. ==References== ==External links== * Official Monetary and Financial Institutions Forum Category:Greek economists Category:Greek women economists Category:Living people Category:Alumni of the University of Oxford Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Danae Kyriakopoulou"},{"id":"60401522","text":"Renato Barisani (15 November 1918 – 3 September 2011) was an Italian sculptor and painter. == Biography == A native of Naples, Barisani attended the Filippo Palizzi Art Institute of Naples under the guidance, among others, of Alberto Chiancone, Carlo De Veroli and Francesco Galante. He graduated in sculpture in 1937 at the Art Institute of Naples and, thanks to the Filippo Palizzi scholarship, he studied for two years at the Higher Institute of Industrial Art (ISIA) in the Royal Park of Monza where he graduated after having attended the courses of Pio Semeghini, Giuseppe Pagano, Agnoldomenico Pica and Marino Marini. Back in Naples, R. Barisani attended the Academy of Fine Arts, a period during which he won, in 1940, the first prize for sculpture and bas- relief to the Prelittoriali dell'Arte. In 1941 he graduated in Sculpture at the Academy of Fine Arts in Naples and in the same year he won the sculpture award \\"Vincenzo Gemito\\". In August of the same year, he was called to arms in the Italian Army from which he was discharged in September of the following year. In 1948 he started teaching art at the Liceo Artistico di Napoli, until 1956, when he became lecturer at the State Art Institute of Torre del Greco. From 1950 to 1955, together with R. De Fusco, G. Tatafiore and A. Venditti, he formed the \\"Neapolitan concrete art group\\", moving into geometric-abstract research. During these years Renato Barisani exhibited at the Abstract and Concrete Art Exhibition in Italy at the National Gallery of Modern Art in Rome and at the collective exhibitions in Montecarlo, Milan and Florence. From 1953 to 1957 he was also present in the \\"Concrete Art Movement\\" of Milan (MAC), participating in almost all the exhibitions, including historical ones, in Italy and abroad. After participating in various national exhibitions, together with the Milanese group (MAC), the Neapolitan concrete art group held an important exhibition in 1954 at the Medea Gallery in Naples. In these years, together with a concretist pictorial production, it is outlined the period dedicated to the research of plastic nature by the artist, which mainly sees the use of materials such as painted iron and plexiglass. Between 1956 and 1962, on the other hand, it is possible to place a nucleus of informal pictorial works, characterized by a strong material interest clearly visible through the use of mechanical objects. From 1960 to 1963, at the invitation of the founder Georges Kasper, he joined the \\"New European School\\" in Lausanne. In this period he took part in the most important exhibitions in Antwerp, Lausanne, Trieste and Brussels. In 1961 Renato Barisani exhibited at the Galleria San Carlo in Naples with a solo show and in 1962 he was invited to exhibit at the XXXI Venice Biennale. The same year he won the Sicilia Industria Award in Palermo and the Swiss Abstract Painting Award. In 1963 one of his works was exhibited at the Contemporary Italian Paintings exhibition, held in some of the major Australian cities. This period shows a return to the pure form of concretist origin that dates back to the mid-1960s. The following decades are characterized by the continuous experimentation of different artistic and media languages ranging from geometric research conducted both in painting and sculpture, to material interest, to the use of sensitive paper, to collages with sandpaper, photocopies and other materials. From 1964 the artist also devoted himself to the decoration of ceramics, winning the second prize at the \\"Ceramica Grandecoro\\" competition and the second prize at the 5th Biennial of Metal Art in Gubbio in Modena in 1969. He is invited to the Roman Quadrennial of 1965 and 1986, to the Venetian Biennials of 1962 and 1972 and, in 1977, R. Barisani exhibits in his first important anthological exhibition at the Museum of Villa Pignatelli in Naples, where he presents works realized in the period from 1940 to 1975 . In 1978 he was assigned the position of professor of Design at the Academy of Fine Arts in Naples, which he will leave in 1984. The following years are marked by intense experimentation with techniques and materials: oil paintings, spray, watercolor, pastels, sands and wooden forms with which he made collages and the first paintings that characterize his last period. In 1993 Barisani received the prestigious award from the Pollock-Krasner Foundation of New York City. In October 2000, the City of Naples dedicated a major anthological exhibition to him in Castel dell'Ovo, with works from the 1950s to 2000. On that occasion, a large painted steel sculpture, the Grande Arco, was permanently installed on the entrance to the castle, which the artist intended to be as a gift for the City of Naples. In the same year, another large sculpture is located, also in painted corten steel, in the gardens of the Quattro Giornate underground station in Naples. In 2008, the Palazzo Delle Arti in Naples dedicated a personal exhibition to him with the most recent works of art, colored sculptures, paintings and a selection of the latest jewelry. The following year Barisani was included, from a special commission of the historic and prestigious Academy of San Luca in Rome, among the last five preselected artist for the Award of the President of the Republic to a painter. Renato Barisani died in Naples on 3 September 2011, at the age of almost 93 years. On 8 October of the same year, the last personal exhibition was held in Rome, previously agreed upon by the artist and then realized, after his death, by his son.Agnisola, Barisani, Renato Barisani.

It is located at 2222 Broadway. The school offers its students the rigorous International Baccalaureate program (IB) as well as an array of Advanced Placement courses (AP). As of 2019, the annual tuition for grades 9–12 is $45,900. Admission is selective and approximately 30% of the student body receives some form of financial aid. The school was originally founded by Mother Mary Keating on August 16, 1887 as the first Schools of the Sacred Heart Academy west of the Rockies. The first year enrolled 30 young women operating in two rented Victorians at the corner of Bush and Octavia. The founding organization is known as the Schools of the Sacred Heart, San Francisco. In 1888, they purchased a larger building at Franklin and Ellis for $10 in gold coin. They stayed there until the 1906 Earthquake when the building was heavily damaged. Renting another Victorian at the corner of Washington and Octavia, they were one of the first institutions to reopen after the earthquake. In 1909, the school purchased the Van Arsdale house on Jackson Street where the school remained until 1939. In June 1939, Maud Lee Flood donated the home she had shared with her deceased husband at 2222 Broadway. During WWII, boys were allowed to join the lower school. By 1948 they needed more room to expand, they courted a deal to purchase the Grant house for $150,000, well below market value. The lower school, grades 1-8 split to the new location, while the upper school remained at the Flood Mansion. But what to do with the boys? In 1956, they purchased the Hammond House for $165,000 to open Stuart Hall for Boys.https://www.sacredsf.org/about/history-network-of-sacred-heart-schools The school now operates in partnership with the all boy's Stuart Hall High School located at 1715 Octavia Street. Typically the first two years, freshmen and sophomore year, are spent single sex but then become co-ed by junior year and higher level courses. The unique partnership allows both schools to operate both single-sex and coeducational classes. Coed classes are held on both campuses and student shuttle buses operate between the two. The partnership is referred to as Convent & Stuart Hall.https://issuu.com/productioncsf/docs/csf-9-10-04 ==References== Category:Girls' schools in California Category:Catholic secondary schools in California Category:Educational institutions established in 1887 Category:High schools in San Francisco Category:Sacred Heart schools in the United States Category:Private K-12 schools in California ","title":"Convent of the Sacred Heart High School (California)"},{"id":"60401586","text":"FAPI can refer to: * Pietersburg Civil Aerodrome * Functional APIs * Fellow of the Australian Property Institute * Foreign Accrual Property Income rules (see Copthorne Holdings Ltd v Canada) * Financial-grade API ","title":"FAPI"},{"id":"60401592","text":"\\"The World Is a Ghetto\\" is a song written and performed by War.

Bazyler, Kathryn Lee Boyd, Kristen L. Nelson, Oxford University Press, 2019, pages xxxiii-xxxvi === Poland === Prior to Second World War Poland had a Jewish population of over 3.3 million, of which only 369,000 survived the war and the Holocaust. After the war ended, the communist government in Poland, in a rush to rebuild the German destroyed country, enacted a wide program of nationalization taking over both Polish and Jewish owned property. Polish nationalists protest at law on restitution of Jewish property 12.05.19 Most of the property seized and nationalized by the communists after the war, including most of the properties in the Polish capital of Warsaw, belonged to non-Jewish Poles and estimates of Jewish claims are just between 15%-20% of all potential claims.Witold Jurasz:Ustawa 447, czy miedzy panika a chowaniem glowy w piasek Onet.pl 16.05.19 Jewish properties which were confiscated by the Nazis and subsequently nationalized by the Soviet installed Communist authorities in Poland as \\"abandoned properties\\". According to Dariusz Stola, the laws nationalizing \\"abandoned property\\" \\"...have been imposed with, among other things, the possessions of murdered Jews in mind\\", though they did not include explicit ethnic criteria; however the near-complete destruction of Poland's Jewry, along with the fact that only Jewish property was officially confiscated as such by the Nazi regime, suggest \\"abandoned property\\" was generally understood to be \\"Jewish property\\", and most the victims' property was classified as \\"abandoned\\". In Warsaw, the post-war Bierut Decree transferred all land, regardless of the identity of the owner, to the control of the city; while in theory owners could demand for compensation, in practice such claims were mostly refused or ignored.‘They stole the soul of the city’: how Warsaw's reprivatisation is causing chaos, Guardian, 18 December 2017 The \\"abandoned\\" properties are estimated to have a total value in the billions of dollars.Lily Widner, 97, survived the Holocaust and much more.

Rzeczpospolita 04.02.2018 Opinia organizacji żydowskich na temat ustawy reprywatyzacyjnej In 1960 a treaty signed between People's Republic of Poland and United States stated that all compensation claims in US would be directed to and dealt with by the US government, as Poland paid 40 million dollars (in 1960 values) to US authorities, settling over 10,169 claims, with over 5,022 claim awards, with $100,737,681.63 in the principal amount, plus interest in the amount of $51,051,825.01, with the amount of payment being 33% of principal. United States Department of Justice, Foreign Claims Settlement Commission of the U.S. Completed Programs - Poland Some communal Jewish property was also restored in 1997, after Jewish organizations used the precedent of the restoration of Catholic Church property to make file claims of their own. Artur Wróblewski,: Słowa Mike Pompeo o roszczeniach żydowskich nie padły przypadkowo 14.02.2019 Rzeczpospolita After the fall of Communism some claimants were able to recover their property; however, the small numbers of successful claimants \\"did not change the trend of Jewish property in non-Jewish hands.\\" The recovery process proved highly contentious and controversial, opening the door to fraud and corruption, and a general \\"sense of injustice.\\" In Warsaw in particular it was further complicated by the destruction of Warsaw during the War, with 90% of buildings having been demolished by German troops. In 1997 Poland as part of wider program returned or gave out compensation in regards to religious Jewish communal property In 2018 the Polish government prepared a draft restitution legislation that would allow return of 20% of property value in nature to close descendants of heirs, that had Polish citizenship and were on territory of Poland when their property was nationalized. The law was criticized by Jewish organizations and put on hold. As of late 2018 Poland still had no single, unified law regarding reprivatisation, and the process has been slow and based on a patchwork of several smaller, limited laws. As of 2018 22,000 individuals received compensation. == Provisions == The bill requires the State Department to report to congress on steps that 47 countries in Europe, signatories of the 2009 Terezin Declaration, have taken to compensate Holocaust survivors and their heirs for assets seized by Nazi Germany and post-war communist governments. Additional reporting requirements are specified on restitution to Holocaust survivors who are US citizens or their relatives.House passes bill to help Holocaust survivors obtain restitution, seized assets, JTA (TOI reprint), 25 April 2018 === Heirless property === In addition to the above, the bill contains provision calling for restitution of property even if the owners died without leaving any descendants - the so- called heirless property. It is an accepted customary international law that heirless property becomes property of the state.\\"Under the internationally recognized process of escheat, property of a decedent who has neither a will nor any legal heirs reverts to the state.\\" Cardozo journal of international and comparative law page Volume 13 689 2010 The Terezin declaration states that \\"in some states heirless property could serve as a basis for addressing the material necessities of needy Holocaust (Shoah) survivors and to ensure ongoing education about the Holocaust (Shoah), its causes and consequences\\". The JUST act requires reporting on the adherence to Terezin, including so called heirless property.Poland cancels visit by Israeli officials to discuss property restitution, JPost, Jack Evans, Jeremy Sharon, 14 May 2019 == Responses to the law == While the bill does not single out any particular country, the Polish government sees itself as the target of the law. It particular, it is strongly opposed to compensation for heirless property, as this would imply, in their view, co-responsibility for the Holocaust. In April 2018, former Polish Prime Minister Leszek Miller publicly stated that all property claims by individuals that are US citizens have been settled by the agreement signed between USA and Poland on 16 July 1960. Burza wokół ustawy 447. Leszek Miller przypomina o umowie z USA Wprost 25.04.18 Polish Foreign Minister Jacek Czaputowicz criticized basing restitution of property based on ethnic criteria, which amounts to \\"[demanding] privileges for the Jews, for the Jewish community\\". Czaputowicz noted that Poles who had fought Nazi Germany and later emigrated had their property seized by the Communist authorities, yet \\"nobody speaks on their behalf, only on the behalf of the Jews. That is not good because that divides our society.\\" In reply, the World Jewish Restitution Organization stated that they did not find the act to be discriminatory, as it covers \\"both Holocaust victims and other victims of Nazi persecution.\\" It further added that \\"[we have] long advocated for the passage of [Polish] legislation that would provide restitution to all property owners whose property was wrongfully taken—both Jewish and non-Jewish owners\\". Trump signs Holocaust property law that has angered Poland Diplomat Ryszard Schnepf categorically rejected the idea of paying any compensation for \\"heirless property\\" and different treatment of groups based on their ethnicity or religion. Adam Sandauer criticized the idea of claiming compensation from Poland and what he calls \\"selective treatment of claims based on ethnic criteria\\", wrote that a question arises if the claims should be paid for by German state who murdered original owners rather than Polish state who took over heirless property after the war if the owners perished, as per law. According to Sandauer a global solution based on compromise and compromise need to be enacted that will treat all ethnic groups equally (Jews, Poles, Ukrainians, Armenians, or Serbs and Croats), not just one nation. According to former Polish diplomat and publicist Witold Jurasz, enacting the provision to restitute only former Jewish property (most likely to Jewish American organizations) while leaving non-Jewish property in hands of the state would in effect mean that Polish Jews wouldn't be considered Poles, which could be considered antisemitic, and likewise giving preference to one ethnic group would be racially discriminating. Robert Bakiewicz of the National Radical Camp stated the law was a threat to Poland and involves 300 billion dollars worth of real estate.Polish Far-Right Protests Against Jewish Property Restitution, Bloomberg, Marek Strzelecki and Konrad Krasuski, 11 May 2019Polish far-right protests US law on Jewish restitution, AFP, 11 May 2019 Anti-establishment party Kukiz'15 and an ultra-nationalist coalition established for the EU elections floated bills that would state formally that Poland refuses to compensate for heirless property. === Protests === On 25 April 2018, a protest led by the far-right National Movement's president Robert Winnicki was held in front of the US embassy in Warsaw, Winnicki saying that \\"The Jews will not get a penny from us\\".Polish nationalists protest outside US Embassy against Holocaust restitution, JTA (TOI reprint), 26 April 2018 A Polish-American group, including Richard Widerynski who is the former president of the Polish American Congress of Southern California lobbied against law, saying on their website that demands for restitution are \\"illegitimate extortion attempts\\".Trump signs law to help Holocaust victims reclaim lost property, JTA, 10 May 2018 On 11 May 2019, thousands of far-right Polish nationalists marched to the United States Embassy in Warsaw protesting the JUST act.

This was followed by completing a Masters of Commerce degree in 1992, as well as a Graduate Diploma in Indonesian Modern Language in 1999. Thereafter, Cameron completed a M.A. and subsequently proceeded to complete a PhD in economics at Princeton University. While at Princeton, she received the Bradley Fellowship award and scholarship from the Department of Economics, the Robertson Fellow award at the Woodrow Wilson School, and the Mellon Grant for research in Indonesia, aligning with her research projects. After her graduation in 1996, she continued in an academic and research capacity at the University of Melbourne for 13 years, being promoted to Director of the Asian Economics Centre in 2007 and becoming a Professor for the Department of Economics in 2010. In order to pursue greater involvement in the developmental economics space, Cameron moved to Monash University in 2010, where she acted as the Director for the Centre for Development Economics (CDE) and as a Professor in the Department of Econometrics and Business Statistics. Since 2017, her current role at the Melbourne Institute has allowed her to concentrate on socio-economic research matters in developing countries of interest. In addition to her academic position, Cameron maintains affiliations with Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab (J-PAL) in Boston, while actively contributing publications for the IZA Institute of Labor Economics in Germany, joining as a Research Fellow in February 2012. In 2014, she was also elected as a Fellow of the Australian Academy of Social Sciences. Cameron has extensive experience working with international development organizations and global agencies, such as the World Bank and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (Australia). == Research and published literature == Lisa Cameron's research interests include labour economics, health economics, and developmental economics, specifically in developing nations within Asia (with core countries of focus being Indonesia and China). In most of her research she takes an empirical microeconomics lens, often applying techniques of experimental economics to better understand and gain insights on socio-economic and policy-related issues. While at the World Bank, Cameron focused her earlier efforts in 2004 by preparing a brief on gender inequality for the Indonesian government and a developing research program for the Bank that centered around similar issues. Most recently, she took on Principal Investigator Roles on the evaluation of Indonesian sanitation interventions and child and maternal health trends. Her involvement in DAFTA follows a similar pattern of research, most notably with research projects in disability, gender inequality, and maternal mortality. === Research on developmental economics === With a large focus on the welfare of disadvantaged and marginalized groups and a particular focus around sanitation systems in developing communities, Cameron has published extensive work and forthcoming publications in areas within developmental economics. Cameron's work with Diana Conteras Suarez in evaluating conditional cash transfer (CCT) programs includes new considerations around the role of consumer choice and individual preferences on the likelihood of household participation in these programs, and whether there is evidence of greater aspirations for higher-level education for their children. Through a study conducted in Colombia, Cameron concludes that despite CCT programs driving marginal increases in human capital, the association is primarily due to the rise in disposable income that allows for a greater propensity to invest in schooling. In reality, these transfer programs had no impact on the participants' time preferences, where parents actually assigned a lower probability to their children completing higher levels of education with their involvement in these programs. This suggests a potential risk of over- dependency on money transfers as the children becoming increasingly educated. ==== Indonesia ==== Studying the impacts of widely-used community-led total sanitation programs in rural Indonesia with Susan Olivia and Manisha Shah, Cameron concludes that while the initiative resulted in a scaled roll-out across the country and contributed to increases in proper sanitation infrastructure and lowered acceptance rates of open defecation among citizens, there was no evidence of direct impact on children with respect to mitigating anemia and other functional characteristics. The household data collected from randomized trials suggests that while local governments are becoming more proactive in supporting development projects for water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH), there exists several barriers in enabling systematic changes within Indonesian communities, including varying levels of social and economic capital, levels of poverty, and the willingness of local governments to offer educational support regarding sanitation to citizens. However, local governments were found to lag behind World Bank contractors in terms of their effectiveness in implementing these solutions. Relatedly, in another exploration of the impacts of open defecation on economic growth and development, Cameron, Shah, and Paul Gertler find a negative linear correlation between open defecation rates in villages and the average heights of children (leading to increases of up to 0.44 standard deviations), but only in the case where open defecation was completely eliminated from the environment. The authors also suggest that health promotions and educational campaigns incentivizing individuals to install sanitation facilities were less effective in driving adoption compared to offering subsidies for installation. Cameron's work on health economics extends to an exploration on the \\"double burden\\" of malnutrition in broader South East Asia, where both under-nutrition and over-nutrition run rampant and contribute to systemic health problems within the countries in the Pacific. By adapting the UNICEF framework for malnutrition determinants and the Lancet series' recent obesity framework and examining vulnerabilities in children through body mass index comparisons, she concludes that almost 50% of the global double burden of malnutrition exists in South East Asia and the Pacific alone, holding the fastest increase in female overweight rates in the past 30 years. Based on these findings, a number of policy-based opportunities are identified in order to mitigate the health risks in the South East Asian regions, including commission new research, pushing for private sector involvement, and emphasizing the regional monitoring of nutritional outcomes. ==== China ==== In her most recent publication, Cameron examines the relationship between rising crime rates in China and the marriage market, specifically by looking at the sex ratio and other behavioural drivers of criminality in certain districts within the country. Through collecting survey and experimental data on prison inmates and compatible non-inmates (migrants) in Shenzhen, Cameron finds through regression analysis that the propensity to commit crimes in China is positively associated with the high prevailing sex ratios (marriageable age from 18-27) through two factors. She argues that based on this cohort analysis, criminality is mostly driven by the behaviour of unmarried men through mechanisms in the marriage market. In this case, given high sex ratio environments within Shenzhen, there is increased competition on the marriage markets, putting pressure on men to appear more financiallyattractive and thus incentivizing these unmarried men to commit higher-value, riskier crimes in order to achieve their goals. === Research on policy topics and women in the economy === The second key area of Cameron's economic contributions are specifically around policy considerations, stemming directly from her extensive experience at the World Bank and DAFTA. In a key publication on social protection for women in developing nations updated in February 2019, Cameron asserts that there are large barriers to accessibility for women looking for social protection schemes, and that optimizing the delivery and uptake of these initiatives requires a concerted effort to design programs that can be scaled up to reach a large number of women. Empirically, she finds that while employment guarantee schemes, pension schemes, microfinance, and conditional cash transfer programs can all be useful in closing the gap in earnings and sustained work, they are often not tailored to specific groups of women and thus fail to adequately protect women. These necessary accommodations can be filled jointly by governments and the efforts of non- governmental organizations to account for the individual differences in women's everyday lives. ==== Indonesia ==== Cameron's current and existing research within economic policy in Indonesia spans a broad range of topics, including gender inequality in Indonesian labour markets from a government policy perspective, the impacts of criminalization of sex work, determinants of maternal mortality, and female labour force participation rates in Indonesia. As seen in the research topics, Cameron's work has been increasingly focused on women in the developing economies. Through her policy analysis, she finds that the Indonesian female labour participation rate has stayed for two decades at a constant 51%, primarily due to supply-side drivers. Marital status was found to be a key factor in determining the degree of labour force participation in Indonesia, where a married woman in a rural area is 11% less likely to be working or looking for work. This is compared to urban areas where married women are 24% less likely to be in the workforce relative to single women, with both of these statistics driven further by the level of educational attainment. Using an economic growth model, she forecasts that Indonesia would need to increase its female labour force participation rate to 58.5% to contribute the G20's overall goal of decrease the female-male participation gap to 25% by 2025, which is noted to be unlikely given the current state labour market conditions. Extending the work on labour force participation further, Cameron has conducted a general study of gender inequality in Indonesia that builds on previous research and literature from the Global Gender Gap Report in 2014, providing new insights specifically in the East Asian region. This includes the extent of the gender-wage gap totalling 41%, suggesting large levels of wage discrimination against women with only a small proportion of this explainable by differences in productive characteristics. Additionally, she notes that the phenomenon of \\"sticky floors\\", where women in lower-paid and lower-skilled jobs face more difficulties compared to women at the top of the spectrum, compounds with industrial segregation by occupation and contributes greatly to this disparity. Cameron notes that future priorities and initiatives to mitigate effects of the wage gap should be closely tied to entry and re-entry decisions into the labour market at the individual level. In collaboration with the Australian-Indonesian Partnership for Economic Governance and the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the work of Diana Contreras- Suarez, Cameron provides a policy-based view of disability in Indonesia and its impacts on economic development and welfare. In the research, she notes that the main drivers of disabilities are through diseases and accidents, with the average years of education only being 2.8 to 4.4 years compared to 6.5 years for individuals with no disabilities. This problem is further exacerbated by the fact that the majority of individuals with disabilities do not use assistive devices to help mitigate their health and personal issues. Cameron suggests that there is a huge opportunity to collect higher quality data to inform and build adequate policy mechanisms. ==== China ==== Cameron's analysis of the One-Child policy in China with Xin Meng focuses on the impact of population and economic growth, specifically with potential impacts of gender imbalances and cultural preferences in terms of child bearing. She notes that the overall economic impact of the One-Child policy is extremely difficult to determine, with conflicting effects such as a heavier productivity burden on younger generations but with associated stimulations in the country's net savings rate. Due to many Chinese households preferring a son in the child birth, the increasing ratio between the number of men to women has led to many men being unable to find a partner. With the current day policy being looser in requirements, Cameron asserts that although there is now more possibility for greater fertility rates, the majority of urban women are likely to delay childbirth in favour of higher-level education(with no impact on rural Chinese households who were not restricted by the original One-Child policy). === Research on other topics in economics === Other topics of Cameron's research include experimental economics examinations of risk- taking within natural disaster contexts, institutional corruption, the complements and substitutes discussion for cannabis, alcohol, and cigarettes, and the considerations in the cultural integration of immigrants. * With an experimental risk analysis conducted within the South East Asia regions most prone to natural disasters, the key finding is that individuals who recently suffered a flood or earthquake behave with more risk-aversion, due to attributing a higher probability of experiencing another natural disaster in the future. * Defining culture as \\"an individual's accumulated experience, shaped by the social, institutional, and economic aspects\\", Cameron finds that there is greater variation in the propensities to punish corrupt behaviour in select countries such as Indonesia, Singapore, India, and Australia, relative to engaging in similar behaviour. * Applying individual data from the National Drug Strategy Household Surveys, Cameron argues that there is some analytical evidence from own-price effects and cross-price elasticities to suggest that cannabis is a substitute product to alcohol (with alcohol and cigarettes being complementary goods), with increases in usage in older individuals due to liberalization of cannabis laws in South Australia. * By performing laboratory experiments and examining the cultural integration patterns of Chinese individuals living in Australia, Cameron claims that the greater the proportion of education received in \\"Western standards\\", the greater the negative impact on behavioural characteristics such as altruism and trust, while adhering less to norms of their original Eastern heritage. == Selected bibliography == *Cameron, Lisa A., Meng, Xin, & Zhang, Dandan.

In January 2018, it has been designated as an AAAA level tourist site by the China National Tourism Administration. ==Name== Legend has it that Han dynasty Taoist priest Ge Xuan became an immortal here. ==Temples== Mount Gexian, one of the most ancient mount in China, has a long history and deep cultural roots. It is full of historial sites and cultural relics associated with numerous legends. The Gexian Ancestral Temple (), also known as Yuxu Temple (), it the largest Taoist temple on the mountain. The original temple named \\"Zonghua Temple\\" () dates back to the 9th century during the Tang dynasty (618-907). In 1065, Emperor Yingzong of Song inscribed and honored the name \\"Yuxu Temple\\". In 1092, it was renamed \\"Gexian Hall\\" (). It has been burned down and rebuilt a member of times, due to wars. The latest repair was in 1928. The grand temple complex is located in the northeast and faces the southwest with brief layout, it includes the Grand Hall of Gexian, Hall of Lord Lao Zi, Hall of Guanyin, Hall of Lingguan (), Hall of the Earth Mother, and the Hall of Jade Emperor and east and west annex halls.

Cobb-Clark is an Australian economist. She is currently working as a Professor in the University of Sydney and as a Chief Investigator in the ARC Centre of Excellence for Children and Families over the Life Course. She has also worked in Bonn, Germany at the Institute for the Study of Labor (IZA) since 2000, where she holds the position of director of the Program in Gender and Families. == Education and work == Deborah Cobb-Clark graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in economics from Michigan State University, in 1983. In 1986, she got her Master of Arts in economics from the University of Michigan, where four years later, in 1990, she graduated from with a Ph.D. also in economics. Cobb-Clark started her career at the University of Melbourne as the Ronald Henderson Professor and Director of the Melbourne Institute of Applied Economic and Social Research. She later founded the Social Policy Evaluation, Analysis and Research Centre (SPEAR) at the Australian National University. Over the years, she held positions such as teacher assistant at the Illinois State University and labor economist at the US Department of Labor. She is currently an economic Professor in the University of Sydney, a chief investigator at the Centre of Excellence for Children and Families over the Life Course, and director of the Program in Gender and Families at the Institute for the Study of Labor, IZA. == Research == Cobb-Clark’s interests and areas of specialization focus on how the labour market is affected by social policies. She concentrates her research on the effects that such policies have on education, immigration, youth transitions, retirement, sexual and racial discrimination and health. === Youth transitions === Cobb-Clark's aim in this research is to help implement policies in Australia to help disadvantaged youth by creating a norm to identify youth at risk. In her paper \\"The capacity of families to support young Australians: financial transfers from parents, co-residence and youth outcomes\\", the data collected reveals that modern youth are increasingly dependent on their parents for money, education, and life choices as the public sector offers little support to children. The research finds that families' tendencies to make use of income support tools is related to their children's education and employment. Children from families in need of income support are less likely to receive money from their parent and be part-time employees but more likely to be unemployed. However, no correlation has been found between a family's economic state and the children's enrolment in academic institutions. Furthermore, the analysis of her article \\"Intergenerational Disadvantage: Learning about Equal Opportunity from Social Assistance Receipt\\" shows a link between the kids and the parents' need of social assistance: children coming from families that require social assistance are, in turn, more likely to be in need of social assistance in their future. This correlation is even stronger in minority families, single parent families, and vulnerable families. === Health === Cobb-Clark focuses on mental health's impacts on work productivity to find the correlation between mental health and diminishing productivity as well as absenteeism in order to create policies that would help increase the yield at work of people with mental illnesses. Deborah Cobb- Clark, along with Melisa Bubonya and Mark Wooden, explore the impacts of mental health on productivity in their paper \\"Mental Health and Productivity at Work: Does What You Do Matter?\\". The findings showed a lower rate of work attendance for people with a reported mental health illnesses. The work environment, including job security , complexity of the tasks, and work- related stress, impacts people with goof mental health differently than it impacts people with poor mental health. In fact, high job security is related to high work absences in women with good mental health as opposed to women with poor mental health. Also, stress and complexity of work seem to have little effect on people with poor mental health's decision to show up to work. Furthermore, in the paper \\"The Bilateral Relationship between Depressive Symptoms and Employment Status\\", Cobb-Clark and Bubonya find that mental illnesses such as depression affect labour productivity, but that the truth also holds for the inverse causality: inability to find work can lead to depressive episodes and mental illnesses on the long-run. == Awards and honours == * In the Top 10% female economists in 2019 * Second highest ranked female economist in Australia * 2018 Distinguished Fellow of the Australian Economic Society Award * 2009 Elected Fellow of the Academy of the Social Sciences in Australia == Selected bibliography and works == * Cobb-Clark, D.

She is a founder of the \\"Not Nice\\" social movement, of the Tor Hazahav (Golden Age) Mizrahi political movement. In April 2019, she ran in the national elections for the Knesset as a candidate for the Gesher party, led by Orly Levy- Abekasis. == Early life and family == Elmakiyes was born in Ashkelon, to Michael Elmakiyes and Rina Amos. Her father was a Mizrahi social activist, who participated in the Wadi Salib riots and was a founder of the 1992 Gesher political party, and former candidate for the Knesset. Her mother is a seamstress. Both are immigrants to Israel from Morocco. Elmakiyes is one of their eight biological children, and they adopted another child as well. Elmakiyes grew up in the distressed \\"Shikunim\\" Neighborhood of Ashkelon, which was nicknamed \\"Harlem\\" by its residents. In elementary school, she attended local, religious, Rambam Elementary, but in middle school she was transferred to Ronson, a regional integration project, where she felt out of place. When it was time for high school, it was decided to send her to Ort Negev, a trade high school, where she was intended to learn to be a child caregiver. Even at her young age, she realized that all the Mizrahi youngsters were being sent to trade schools to learn to be hairdressers or electricians, while the Ashkenazi teens were sent to college preparatory schools. She decided not to cooperate, and dropped out of school at age 16. She eventually competed the matriculation exams on her own, and went on to higher education in the arts, her desired field. Elmakiyes completed her undergraduate degree in film at the Kinneret Academic College. When she was 17, Elmakiyes moved to Tel Aviv, to live with her older sister, and began working in a shop near Dizengoff Center. One day in 1994, while waiting in line at the ATM, a bomb went off, and Elmakiyes was thrown back several meters. It was the Dizengoff Center suicide bombing, a suicide terrorist attack, in which 14 people were killed and over 120 wounded. Elmakiyes was lightly wounded, but suffered extreme trauma from the experience and what she witnessed. Her rehabilitation took several years, also releasing her from mandatory military service. She says, \\"It was a complicated time, which took me far off the normal path. I wasn't severely wounded, but seeing children explode before your eyes is an indescribable horror. I will never forget it, these are things that stay with you for life.\\" It was only after she completed rehabilitation that she was able to pursue her education. In addition to her degree in filmmaking, Elmakiyes completed several other courses in the arts, including learning to be a medical clown. == Social activism == Elmakiyes began her activism in the Mizrahi feminist movement, Ahoti – for Women in Israel. After two years of volunteering, she was appointed project manager for the Libi BaMizrach Coalition (My Heart Is in the East), an umbrella group for over thirty Mizrahi cultural organizations. As part of this multi-cultural project, the \\"Black Night of Culture\\" are held every year as a protest against the municipality of Tel Aviv's \\"White Night of Culture\\", which takes place in the wealthier, largely white Ashkenazi neighborhoods, and which seeks to shine a spotlight on the neglect, crime, pollution, drug trade and other issues relegated to the mostly Mizrahi and African neighborhoods of South Tel Aviv. She is a producer together with Shula Keshet, and on the steering committee of Libi BaMizrah's annual culture festival. In 2011, Elmakiyes was one of the founder of the \\"Not Nice\\" movement, a group of activists from Mizrahi neighborhoods who organized to get Mizrahi issues on the public agenda. The group's goals are to reduce class social and class gaps, improve public housing and deal with the housing shortage in Israel, and to eliminate poverty. Elmakiyes and other group members are highly visible in demonstrations, guerrilla street action (such as changing street names to Mizrahi names), and other forms of protest. The name of the movement is a reclamation of a famous quote by then-prime minister Golda Meir about the Black Panther Mizrahi social justice movement of the 1970s, who dismissed them out of hand, saying, \\"They’re not nice.\\" Elmakiyes is often referred to in the press as \\"The Black Panther[ess]\\", because of her vocal, non-compromising protest style, her refusal to back down, and her own identification with the Israeli Black Panther movement. In 2013, Elmakiyes was arrested together with social activist Sapir Slutsker-Amran at a demonstration against cutting child allowances and other austerity measures that impacted the poorer classes. The protest was mounted in front of then Minister of Finance, Yair Lapid's house. In the course of the violent arrest, Elmakiyes was wounded. She filed a complaint against the policeman who kicked her, citing sexual harassment and battery. Shortly after her release from jail, she initiated a special session in the Knesset of the Internal Affairs and Environment Committee, in which several women members of the Knesset (MKs) participated, and in which she called for feminist activists from all ends of the political spectrum to give testimony about police violence towards female protesters. Elmakiyes then led several demonstrations against police brutality. In 2014, Elmakiyes and the \\"Not Nice\\" group began acting against evictions of residents of Givat Amal Bet, in Tel Aviv. Group members fortified themselves in local dwellings in order to prevent the evictions, and held protests outside the homes of real estate developers and business tycoons Yitzhak Tshuva and the Kozinhoff family. Elmakiyes and other activists were beaten and arrested. Elmakiyes repeated the squatting tactic in 2015, when she and a single mother of six on the housing wait-list shut themselves in the Amidar offices, demanding immediate housing. At another session of the Knesset's Internal Affairs and Environment Committee, Elmakiyes arrived with a group of women without homes who were on the waiting list for public housing, who came in and disrupted the proceedings. In 2016, she created short videos of testimony by women in public housing about the continual sexual harassment they face by Amidar (private company that handles public housing) field agents. MK Orly Levy-Abakesis participated in the production, and the films were released to the press. As a result, a special commission was appointed at Amidar to investigate the issue. Her work on the subject of public housing has been at the forefront of her Activism since 2012, working with some of the other leading activists for this issue, including Ricki Cohen Benlulu, Avigail Biton, and Meital Cohen. She has led and participated in protest in front of the homes of the prime minister, the housing minister, Amidar executives, and more; they have taken their issues to the print and broadcast press, and repeatedly raised the subject in Knesset committee meetings. Elmakiyes and members of the \\"Not Nice\\" group and other Mizrahi activists have been instrumental in exposing corruption in Amidar, and illegal practices. In 2018, Elmakiyes created an exhibition of eight portraits of women with testimonials about public housing. The exhibition, called \\"Leviot\\" (lionesses), included stories of rape, extortion, and solicitation to prostitution by government officials and housing agents. Elmakiyes explained that when she first started working with women in public housing, she heard about various incidents of harassment, but after a while, she realized it was systemic, and that all the women were harassed, or worse. \\"The women are entirely at the mercy of a low- level representative of a housing agency, who with a single negative report can take away their home.\\" And, \\"I realized this is a story that needed to be told. Someone has to be accountable. Some of the women complained, but their cases were closed.\\" The exhibition, produced in cooperation with the Public Housing Forum and MK Orly Levy-Abakesis, showed at the Arab-Jewish Theater in Jaffa. Elmakiyes is also active in the documentation of past misdeeds toward the Mizrahi community in Israel, in particular the issue of kidnapping and selling of babies and toddlers from Yemeni and other Mizrahi immigrants in the 1950s, and of what is known as \\"The Ringworm Affair\\", in which up to 200,000 children (mainly) from Mizrahi background were \\"treated\\" with lethal doses of radiation to eliminate ringworm, causing widespread cases of death and eventual cancer. In both cases, archives are sealed or lost, and there is official resistance to releasing information. == Political activism == In 2016, Elmakiyes, together with Ophir Toubul, Roy Hasan, and other Mizrahi activists, founded the political group Tor Hazahav (the golden age). The group's goals include raising social and political issues affecting Mizrahim before the legislature, and ensuring representation to their marginalized communities. In January 2019, Elmakiyes joined the new Gesher political party, headed by Orly Levy-Abekasis. Heading into the April 9, 2019 elections, Elmakiyes was at number 6 on the party list. The party did not receive the required number of votes to enter the Knesset. However, new elections were announced when no party was able to form a government. In August 2019, Gesher united with the Amir Peretz' Labor party, and Elmakiyes is number 10 on the unified list, one of only three Gesher candidates. This unification is seen as an attempt to court the Mizrahi vote by the traditionally Ashkenazi Labor movement. Elmakiyes' inclusion on the list did not sit well with all veteran Labor voters, and shortly after the announcement several social media posts, which included racist epithets against her and her compatriots, went viral, and engaged the public and media for several days. Elmakiyes was one of the leaders of the movement to release Yonathan Hilo from prison. Hilo was convicted of murder and sentenced to 20 years in prison and financial reparations for killing a man who repeatedly raped him. After multiple unsuccessful appeals, Hilo was released by the clemency board after serving eight years. She is also at the forefront of the \\"Free Avera\\" movement to release and return Avera Mengistu from Hamas captivity. According to Elmakiyes and other political activists, the government and media have barely addressed the issue of Mengistu's capture, alleging that it is because he is black, of Ethiopian heritage; this, as opposed to the similar case of Gilad Shalit, for whom the entire country – the public, the government, and the media – literally went to war. In August 2019, Elmakiyes was listed as number ten on the unified Labor-Gesher list for the September 2019 elections. Her placement on the list was met with criticism by veteran Labor members, due to her past public critiques of the Ashkenazi political and social hegemony. The media furor that followed raised accusations of racism, that the criticism was because of the relatively large number of Mizrahi candidates on the list with the addition of Elmakiyes and Orly Levy-Abekasis, as well as counter- accusations that Elmakiyes is \\"anti-Ashkenazi\\". Elmakiyes stated that her problem is specifically with racists, and not Ashkenazim as a group. == Media and art == * 2014 – Appeared as a commentator on the television program \\"Hakol Kalul\\", on channel 10. * 2014 – Invited to participate in a women's documentary filmmaking laboratory sponsored by the New Fund for Film and Television. * 2015 – Featured in a chapter of Nevi'im, a series of documentary films about Mizrahi social and political activists. * 2015 – The Dutch broadcast authority produced a film about activist from different places in the world.

In March 2018, Elmakiyes was recognized by Lady Globes magazine as one of the 20 leading activists in Israel. == Personal life == Elmakiyes defines herself as \\"Mizrahi, woman, lesbian, religious\\". She says that the identity that is relevant and at the forefront depends on the issue at hand. She is in a long-term relationship. In December 2018, Elmakiyes gave birth to her daughter, Emmanuelle Renee. == References == == External links == * Hanevi'im, Chapter 6: Carmen Elmakiyes * Videos with or about Carmen Elmakiyes on the Social TV channel (in Hebrew) *New Israel Fund/Shatil Partner Profile: Carmen Elmakiyes-Amos Category:1979 births Category:Living people Category:LGBT politicians from Israel Category:LGBT Jews Category:Mizrahi feminists Category:Israeli political activists Category:Israeli feminists Category:Israeli people of Moroccan-Jewish descent ","title":"Carmen Elmakiyes"},{"id":"60401744","text":"Archiheterodonta is an infraclass of bivalve molluscs.Giribet G. 2008.

Following the war, while some Jews received their property back, this tended to be the exception. People who held on to plundered property considered it their own and resented survivors who came back to claim their property. While many countries passed laws on restitution, in many case these were in effect in name only, and in Eastern Europe were often in effect only for a few years. The Terezin declaration was passed in 2009 as a result of what US ambassador Stuart E. Eizenstat termed \\"the unfinished business of World War II\\". In addition to restitution to survivors and heirs, the Terezin Declaration states that in some states heirless property (which devolved to the state) could serve as a basis for addressing the material necessities of needy Holocaust (Shoah) survivors and to ensure ongoing education about the Holocaust (Shoah), its causes and consequences.Terazin Declaration The Justice for Uncompensated Survivors Today (JUST) Act of 2017, requires the United States Department of State to report to congress on steps that the signatories of the Terezin Declaration have taken to compensate Holocaust survivors and their heirs for assets seized by Nazi Germany and post-war communist governments. ==Notes== ==References== ==Further reading== * Category:Aftermath of the Holocaust Category:2009 in law Category:Human rights instruments Category:Global ethics Category:2009 in the Czech Republic ","title":"Terezin Declaration"},{"id":"60401824","text":"The Qianjiangyuan National Forest Park () is a national park in Kaihua County, Zhejiang, China.

In 1915, aged 23, she established the Australian Wounded and Missing Enquiry Bureau to assist the families of soldiers. The bureau, initially based in Cairo and later in London, responded to thousands of requests for information during the First World War. ==Early life== Vera Deakin was born on 25 December 1891 at Llanarth, her parents' home in South Yarra, Melbourne. She was the youngest of three daughters born to Pattie (née Browne) and Alfred Deakin. Her father was the second Prime Minister of Australia, serving three non- consecutive terms between 1903 and 1910. The Deakin sisters were initially tutored by their aunt Catherine Deakin, before going on to Melbourne Girls Grammar. Vera attended lectures in English literature at the University of Melbourne, but was primarily interested in music. She took cello and vocal lessons, performing publicly for the first time at the Australian Exhibition of Women's Work in 1907. She went to Europe in 1913 to study music in Berlin and Budapest, chaperoned by her aunt Catherine. ==First World War== Vera Deakin Deakin was in London when the First World War broke out, but soon returned home where she joined the Australian Red Cross and completed a course in nursing. In early 1915, she accompanied her parents to the Pan Pacific Exhibition in San Francisco, where her father was the Australian representative. Hoping to undertake some war work, in August she made contact with Norman Brookes – her sister Ivy's brother-in-law and a Red Cross commissioner in Cairo. Brookes encouraged her to come to Egypt, and against her parents' wishes she left Australia in September with her friend Winifred Johnson. They arrived in Port Said the following month. On 21 October 1915, aged 23, Deakin opened the Australian Wounded and Missing Enquiry Bureau in Cairo, with herself as secretary and Johnson as assistant secretary. The bureau sought to gather information about Australian Imperial Force (AIF) soldiers in the Gallipoli campaign to communicate to those back in Australia, serving as \\"the conduit between official sources and the families of soldiers\\". In May 1916, the bureau moved its headquarters to Victoria Street, London, after the AIF was transferred to the Western Front. By late 1917, Deakin was managing 60 staff – including agents in Britain, France, and Belgium – and the bureau had to relocate to a larger building in Grosvenor Place. In three years of operation the organisation created 32,000 files for individual soldiers, and issued 400,000 responses. Deakin later recalled \\"we were often met with suspicion and eventually jealousy, as we had made ourselves felt as a court of appeal for relatives who were unsuccessful in obtaining satisfaction from the military authorities\\". For her work she was made an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 1918 New Year Honours, aged 26. ==Marriage and children== In December 1918, Deakin met Thomas White, a former prisoner of war who had managed to escape from the Ottoman Empire several months earlier. She had previously corresponded with him as part of her duties at the bureau. They became engaged a few weeks after their first meeting, despite opposition from some of her family, and married in Melbourne in March 1920. The couple had four daughters, Lilian (b. 1921), Patricia (b. 1923), Shirley (b. 1925), and Judith (b. 1929). ==Community work and later life== White maintained her involvement with the Red Cross after her marriage, serving as Victorian divisional commandant (1938–1945) and national vice-chairman (1945–1950, 1964–1966). She was also chairman of its music therapy service from 1950. During the Second World War, she helped mobilise the organisation in Victoria, establishing emergency training groups and reviving the Enquiry Bureau. She was made a life member of the Red Cross in 1945, and \\"probably had a greater influence than any other single person on the development of the Australian Red Cross\\". White served on the management committee of the Royal Children's Hospital from 1931, and was appointed a life governor in 1949. She was also the inaugural chairman of the Committee for Music in Mental Hospitals, inaugural president of the Anzac Fellowship of the Women of Victoria, and president of the Victorian Society for Crippled Children and Adults (1961–1965). From 1951 to 1956, White lived in London where her husband was Australian High Commissioner. After his knighthood in 1952 she was entitled to be known as Lady White. She was widowed in 1957 and died in Melbourne in 1978, aged 86; she was the last surviving child of Alfred Deakin. In 2018 the Royal Historical Society of Victoria hosted \\"Vera Deakin's World of Humanity\\", an exhibition about her life. ==References== ==Further reading== * Category:1891 births Category:1978 deaths Category:Red Cross personnel Category:Australian Officers of the Order of the British Empire Category:People from Melbourne Category:Organization founders Category:Women nonprofit executives Category:Australian women of World War I Category:Children of Prime Ministers of Australia Category:People educated at Melbourne Girls Grammar Category:19th-century Australian women Category:20th- century Australian women ","title":"Vera Deakin White"},{"id":"60401872","text":"Sara Modiano (January 11, 1951 – 2010) was a Colombian artist. Modiano's professional artistic career was made up of many styles of art that developed over the years. She is most known for her Performance Art and Photographic series with elements of geometric shapes that overlap her self-portraits. Her art surrounds ideas on human identity, intense emotion, introspection, sexuality, and the feminine body. To honor her legacy the Sara Modiano Foundation of the Arts was established and each year issues the Sara Modiano Grant, which is given based on financial need and artistic ability. Her work has been displayed in places such as the Hammer Museum, Brooklyn Museum, Caribbean Regional Artists Salon, and Museum of Latin American Art. == Biography == Sara Modiano was born on January 11, 1951 in Barranquilla, Colombia to Jacques Modiano and Eva Grunfeld. Modiano started off studying Mathematics at the University of Los Andes in Bogotá, but soon transferred to the School of Fine Arts at Atlantic University in Barranquilla. Over the course of her career, she's been in a multitude of group exhibitions, had 9 solo exhibitions, and received 5 awards in her honor. Her artwork can be found anywhere from the Museum of Modern Art in Bogotá, Colombia to the Museum of Latin American Art in Long Beach, California. However, Modiano was not consistent in her form of art works 1987 to 2001, having the human body be the muse for her work and a possible foreshadowment concerning her own body and health. In 2006, Modiano was diagnosed with ovarian cancer and died in 2010. The four years in between her death, however, were focused on a new medium; performance art. She died at 59, but her three children keep her artwork alive through the Fundación Sara Modiano para las Artes (Sara Modiano Foundation for the Arts). == Art Works == *Cube Project, 2004 *Posibilidad de dos ventanas, 1977 *Cuatro ventanas, 1977 *Desaparece una cultura, 1981 *Intimate, 2002 *Reflect, 2007 == Select exhibitions== === Solo === * 1974: Barrios Gallery, Barranquilla, Colombia * 1975: Belarca Gallery, Bogotá, Colombia * 1979: Centro Colombo Americano, Barranquilla, Colombia * 1979: Galeria de la Oficina, Medellín, Colombia * 1982: Quintero Gallery, Barranquilla, Colombia * 2003: La Resistencia de L’Art, Mallorca, Spain * 2003: CUBE I: Multi Media Art Experience “Art Loves Design”, Art Basel, Miami Beach, Florida * 2004: Featured Artist, Art Miami 2004, Miami Beach Convention Center, Miami, Florida * 2004: CUBE II: Multi Media Art Experience “Art Loves Design”, Art Basel, Miami Beach, Florida === Group === * 1975: IV Salón Nacional de Arte, Museum of Modern Art, Bogota, Colombia * 1975: XXV Salón Nacional de Artistas, Bogota, Colombia * 1976: V Abril Artistico, Museo de Zea, Medellin * 1976: XXVI Salón Regional y Nacional of Visual Arts, Bogotá, Colombia * 1977: 40 artistas mujeres (40 Women Artists), Museum of Modern Art, Bogotá, Colombia * 1977: Los novísimos de Colombia (The Newisms from Colombia), Museum of Contemporary Art, Caracas, Venezuela * 1979: Arte contemporáneo de la costa, (Contemporary Art from the Coast), Museum of Modern Art, Cartagena, Colombia * 1980: Salón Atenas, Museum of Modern Art, Bogotá, Colombia * 1980: Arte en los 80 (Art in the 80's), Museum of Modern Art, Medellín, Colombia, Museum of Modern Art, Pereira, Colombia and Garces Velasquez Gallery, Bogotá, Colombia (1981) * 1983: Aspectos de lo tridimensional (Aspects of the Tridimensional), Museo de Arte La Tertulia, Cali, Colombia * 1984: Colombia en tres dimensiones (Colombia in 3 D), Museum of Modern Art Bogota, Colombia * 1985: 100 Años de arte colombiano 1886-1986 (100 Years of Colombian Art 1886 – 1986), Museum of Modern Art, Bogota, Colombia * 1986: Contemporary Colombian Art, The Mall Gallery, London, UK and Brussels, Belgium * 2002: Invited Artist, Premi d’ Arts Plastiques, Palma de Mallorca, Spain * 2003: Invited Artist, Premi d’ Arts Plastiques, Palma de Mallorca, Spain * 2003: Salón Atenas, Museum of Modern Art, Bogotá, Colombia * 2003: Cube I: Multi Media Art Experience, Art Basel, Miami Beach, Florida * 2004: City of Miami Time Capsule, Miami, Florida * 2004: Cube II: Multimedia Art Experience, Art Basel, Miami Beach * 2007: L.A.

Beginning in the 90s, Sara Modiano's style of work demonstrates a shift from installations, paintings, and sculpture to performance art and photography. This shift in style was pivotal in accentuating the new messages and interpretations Modiano was demonstrating. While continuing to express the theme of introspection, she began to place more focus on her sexuality, individuality, life, and ecstatic moments. Through this, Modiano shines a light on the female body and femininity through sexuality by making the audience question how they perceive the introspective, subliminal side of all women. Inside Out from her Fragmented series shows a fragmented photograph zoomed into her face capturing the móment she reaches orgasm. Modiano used this moment of sexual arousal to represent the start of new life as well as a similarity all humans experience with one another: sexual pleasure. Similar to this piece is Conexión Interior, a photograph of Modiano with a focus on her torso and chest while her face is turned away. This feeling and illusion of fragmentation was a common technique Modiano used in many more of her photographic pieces. She integrated geometrical shapes, such as cubes/squares, to the photographs of herself to further solidify pinnacle moments, such as orgasms, as ethereal and intangible. One of her last works was in 2007 titled Reflect. This photographic self-portrait series is slightly different from Inside Out and Conexión Interior because Modiano demonstrates herself in a new elevated way without the geometric illusion. Her body is fully painted to make herself look metallic as she is in front of a plain blue background. The self- portraits come from still of Modiano in motion as she expressed four heightened emotions: agony, pain, love, and ecstasy. Modiano shows her emotional, raw self yet again while calling to question our ideas and notions on how we identify ourselves. She portrayed herself as almost an extraterrestrial being with the contrast of colors while making the viewer reflect on how all humans have felt the emotions of pain, love, agony, and ecstasy before. Modiano described how this series made her feel about herself: \\"a woman with a big ego\\". == Performance Art == === \\"About Myself\\" At La Presencia Latin American Art in the United States at the MoIMA === During the performance piece, Modiano used her body in a public space in efforts to change the perspective of people in the area. She was draped in a dress of wired cylinders as she wandered about the crowd using movements with her arms and hands to interact with the people surrounding her. Modiano's purpose for this piece was to physically demonstrate the intangible connection between art, view, and space by fueling herself with the reactions of the audience. == Legacy == Sara Modiano had a professional art career of forty years where she made clear demonstration of advanced conceptual and introspective ideas on humanity, emotions, and sexuality. A few years before she passed, her work was recognized and praised by the director of the \\"IKF (International Kids Fund) Latin American Art Auction\\" by having her work chosen for the event on many occasions. She will always be recognized as an important and active artist who was part of the Branquilla movement from the 1980s as well as a staple of Colombian art heritage. It has been over 10 years since she has passed and her work continues to be displayed at the Museum of Modern Art in Bogotá (MoMAB). == The Sara Modiano Foundation for the Arts: Sara Modiano Grant == Sara Modianos life is recognized and honored every year, since 2013, through the Sara Modiao Grant granted by The Sara Modiano Foundation for the Arts to young Latin American artists in Colombia. Through the course of Modiano's career, she believed in making art an accessibility for everyone and anyone, and through this foundation created by her children, her staple in the art world will be passed down for generations. == References == Category:2010 deaths Category:1951 births Category:Colombian women artists Category:People from Barranquilla Category:University of Los Andes (Colombia) alumni ","title":"Sara Modiano"},{"id":"60401873","text":"Ryan McIlvain is an American novelist and essayist.

He created scenes on historical and literary subjects, as well as genre scenes and portraits. == Life and work == His creative career began in the 1820s and first attracted attention at the Paris Salon in 1822, where he displayed two paintings depicting scenes from The Tempest by Shakespeare.François Guillaume Dumas, Ludovic Baschet. Catalogue illustré Salon 1822. Paris. 1822. P. 130. A young journalist named Adolphe Thiers (who would later become the President of France) wrote a positive review of the exhibit and called him a painter of great promise. This inspired him to create more works on literary themes. Among these works are lithographs showing Louis XI with Countess Isabelle de Croye, from Quentin Durward by Sir Walter Scott, and scenes from Henry III and His Court, an early play by Alexandre Dumas.Gillot Saint-Evre. Henri III: Acte III scène (estampe) / G. Saint Evre 1829 (sig.). BnF. The failure of a series of works on Don Quixote forced him to do a critical reevaluation of his work. He decided to abandon literature in favor of history. Although he focused on events from Medieval France, he continued to paint in the prevailing Romantic and Sentimentalist style. He premiered his new specialty at the Salon of 1833, with a scene depicting Joan of Arc being presented to King Charles VII in 1429; currently at the Мusée National in the Palace of Versailles.Joan of Arc Presented to Charles VII; Base Joconde, Ministry of Culture. This was the first of a series of paintings on her life. Generally, critics now consider the history paintings to be inferior to his portraits.

L.R. 581 The verdict was appealed to the Full Court of the Federal Court of Australia, where it was held unanimously that the two Apple programs were original literary works. The majority also held that the Apple read only memory (ROM) chips in the Wombat computer were sufficiently derived from these literary works to constitute an infringement of copyright. Special leave to appeal was granted, and in the High Court of Australia it was held that machine-readable works were not literary works under the 1968 Copyright Act. Consequences of the successful High Court appeal were limited in scope. The decision in the original 1983 trial had already caused major ramifications for the relatively young field of software for personal computing. Soon after the 1983 decision was handed down, the Australian Attorney-General Gareth Evans announced that legislation would be amended to ensure computer software was protected by the Copyright Act and this occurred via the Copyright Amendment Act 1984 No. 43 of 1984.

The term Kuuma koira is Finnish for \\"Hot dog\\", but the ingredients differ so much that Kuuma koira is completely different cuisine. The dish is not well known outside Pirkanmaa region, but Nokia holds an annual International Kuuma koira day in March to celebrate the cuisine.https://allevents.in/nokia/kansainv%C3%A4linen-kuuma- koira-p%C3%A4iv%C3%A4/20002845706068# Thousands of Kuuma koiras are eaten at the local grills on that date. == Invention and rise to fame == The dish was conceived in 1960s by Teodor Leppänen (1902–1978), a fast food grill owner from Nokia. The most well known story about the invention says that he had been selling apple jelly doughnuts with coffee and steamed sausages. Combining the surplus ingredients to save some money, he created Kuuma koira. In the following decades, other grill owners at the area copied the dish, and it became a staple in the local fast food scene. In the end of the first decade of the millennium, MTV3 Ennätystehdas record making show had Mikko Salonen from Nokia eating four and a half Kuuma koiras in 5 minutes on a live broadcast, creating a new official record. Around the same time, the International Kuuma koira day was held for the first time. These events together propelled the cuisine to the knowledge of all Finns, further aided by Finnish Grillit Huurussa fast food program on Nelonen TV channel in 2016. == See also == * Hot dog ==References== Category:Fast food Category:Street food Category:Finnish cuisine Category:Finnish words and phrases ","title":"Kuuma koira"},{"id":"60401985","text":"Chandpur Medical College is a government medical college in Chandpur District, Bangladesh, founded in 2018 and affiliated with Chittagong Medical University.

Anning had previously been a senator for One Nation and Katter's Australian Party, and sat as an independent before founding the new party. The party contested the 2019 federal election, but failed to win a seat. The party was deregistered on 23 September 2020. ==History== Fraser Anning, the party's leader, . ===Defection from One Nation and Katter's Australian Party=== Fraser Anning stood as the third candidate on the One Nation list for Queensland at the 2016 federal election, with Pauline Hanson and Malcolm Roberts standing as the first and second candidates respectively. After Malcolm Roberts was found ineligible during the 2017-2018 eligibility crisis due to his dual citizenship, Anning was declared by the Court of Disputed Returns elected, replacing Roberts. After a conflict with the party's chief of staff James Ashby over his choice of staff, Anning resigned from the party and was sworn in to the senate as an independent. Anning joined Katter's Australian Party in June 2018. During his maiden speech, in August 2018, Anning proposed a \\"final solution to the immigration problem\\" with a referendum and a \\"European Christian\\" immigration system. Despite initially supporting Anning's speech, the party expelled him two months later with Bob Katter labelling Anning's views as racist. ===Party foundation=== In January 2019, Anning applied to register Fraser Anning's Conservative National Party. The National Party and the Australian Conservatives objected to the name, arguing it was too similar to theirs and would cause confusion for voters. The Australian Electoral Commission responded that there was no real chance that electors would be left uncertain about which name attaches to which organisation due to inclusion of \\"Fraser Anning\\" in the name, which would additionally also result in distinct party abbreviations. The AEC approved the party's registration on 2 April 2019, after the application for the formal abbreviation “Conservative Nationals” was withdrawn, in time for the party to contest the 2019 federal election. Anning said he would be \\"announcing candidates across most lower house seats\\" and \\"running a Senate team in every state\\" for the election. ===May 2019 federal election=== The party put up 70 candidates across both houses. These included several who have likened LGBTQI people to paedophiles, those who have been accused of animal cruelty, who have criticised single mothers and disability pensioners, and at least two who have criminal histories. One candidate, Scott Moerland, was a senior figure in the United Patriots Front and has links with Blair Cottrell and Neil Erikson, despite Anning's earlier claim that he would not endorse anyone associated with them. Their social media posts target immigrants from certain countries, Muslims, political correctness, LGBTQI people and ideas, and people and policies tackling climate change. The party failed to win a seat; Anning himself did not get re-elected to the Senate. ===Deregistration=== The party was deregistered on 23 September 2020, under Section 137(4) of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918. == Ideology and policies == Anning himself has been described as far-right, a nationalist and a right-wing populist. He attended a far-right rally in Melbourne for which he claimed almost $3000 in expenses from the government. At the rally he made claims about an \\"African gang problem\\" in Queensland, claims that were rejected by Queensland's police commissioner. He also blamed Muslim immigration for terrorism, calling for an \\"end [to] all immigration from Muslim and black African nations\\". The party believes in the white genocide conspiracy theory. On its Facebook page, a post called for the preservation of \\"our ethno-cultural identity, or we will fast become a minority\\". Its stated policies include: * Australia to be an English- speaking predominantly European Christian society; immigration to reflect this * Traditional family values (no same-sex marriage or abortion) * The right to own firearms and use them in self-defence * Australia-first foreign policy and repudiation of coercive international treaties * Creation of a not-for-profit government bank * Unrestricted freedom of speech (i.e. no hate speech laws or censorship of opinion) * Welfare restricted to Australian citizens ==Controversies== === Cronulla assault === On 26 April 2019, during the 2019 Federal Election campaign, Anning used the site of the 2005 Cronulla race riots in Sydney to announce his party's candidates for New South Wales. A 19-year-old supporter of Anning was arrested and charged with assault and intimidation after being involved in an altercation with members of the media immediately after the announcement, allegedly punching a photographer and abusing a journalist. Video footage shows the young man repeatedly punching the photographer, who sustained injury. The assailant was a member of the militant white supremacist group True Blue Crew, which has been linked to terrorism. ===Rahma el-Dennaoui=== On 12 May 2019, an official post on Anning's Facebook page included a picture of the family of Rahma el-Dennaoui, a toddler who disappeared in 2005, accompanied with the phrase \\"if you want a Muslim for a neighbour, just vote Labor\\" and the party's logo. The photo appeared to be from a 2010 Daily Telegraph article published shortly after the girl's disappearance. The post was deleted the following day, but not before it had attracted a number of negative comments after Mariam Veiszadeh and others had commented about it on social media. ==References== ==External links== *Fraser Anning's Conservative National Party official website Category:2019 establishments in Australia Category:Anti-Muslim sentiment Category:Opposition to Islam in Australia category:Australian nationalist parties Category:Islamophobia in Australia Category:Organizations that oppose same-sex marriage Category:Political parties established in 2019 Category:Far- right political parties in Australia Category:Right-wing populist parties ","title":"Fraser Anning's Conservative National Party"},{"id":"60402185","text":"Manorama School of Communication, also known as MASCOM, is a journalism school in Kottayam, India.

His compositions decorated books of Isaac Asimov, Ray Bradbury, Robert Sheckley, Kurt Vonnegut. Except for the decoration of the publications of Jules Verne, he does not work on commissions. According to the artist, art should not banal reproduce the world, its task is to create new worlds. He is successful in depicting emotions, moods, sensations, feelings of any normal human being. His works are showcased in the National Art Museum of the Republic of Belarus, the Museum of Contemporary Fine Art (Minsk), the graphic museum of Winterthur (Switzerland), the art museums of the cities: Polotsk (Belarus), New Brunswick (USA), Rimini (Italy), Kraków (Poland), Győr (Hungary), Eindhoven (Netherlands), Munich (Germany), as well as in private Belarusian (Alexandr Ivanov) and foreign collections. == Criticism == Works of the artist “capture attention with both high aesthetics and slight irony of usual but seen in the unusual perspective images”, the newspaper Novy Chas invited to visit the artist’s exhibition in 2017. “Balenok's works are distinctive of philosophizing, and despite the „black and white“ style, filled with the bright light of experience, deep reflections of the artist,” the radio station Belaruskaje Radyjo Razyja transmitted impressions from the artist’s exhibition in the Polotsk Art Gallery in 2016. Alisa Mikhailova in the reportage on the Belarus-1 channel from a regular Balenok's exhibition stressed that the features of abstraction, surrealism, and realism are organically put on display in the artist’s works. Art critic Larisa Finkel’steyn in 2014 identified paintings of the artist as “very unexpected and lyrical, in which there is a free movement of color.” At the opening of the solo exhibition dedicated to the 60th anniversary of engraver, Belarusian art historian Natalla Sharangovich praised him with the words, “This is really a fine artist. I have been familiar with his oeuvre for many years, and he is always unpredictable for me.” “The author has a rare quality for a modern creator – the ability to surprise,” Kamila Januškievič assessed the work on the pages of the magazine “Mastactva” following the results of the artist’s exhibition in 2014. Andrey Adamovich observed notes of the Apocalypse in the works of Sergei Balenok.

The Arms Amendment Bill was supported by all parties represented in Parliament except the opposition ACT Party. ==Legislation features== ===Key aims=== The Arms (Prohibited Firearms, Magazines, and Parts) Amendment Act 2019 seeks to remove semi-automatic firearms from public circulation by banning semi- automatic firearms, magazines, and parts that can be used to assemble prohibited firearms. This Act will extend the ban on Military Style Semi- Automatics (MSSAs) to include most semi-automatic firearms and some shotguns. Some small-calibre rimfire semi-automatic firearms and lesser-capacity shotguns are excluded from the prohibition. These excluded firearms have a limited magazine capacity and are commonly used for farming, hunting, and recreational purposes. ===Proscribed items=== Firearms prohibited under the Arms Amendment Act include: * Semi-automatic firearms, except for (provided that they are otherwise not prohibited): ** Pistols ** Firearms designed to discharge rimfire cartridges of .22 calibre or less ** Shotguns with a non- detachable tubular magazine that can hold 5 cartridges or less * Pump-action shotguns which: ** Are capable of being used with a detachable magazine, or ** Have a non-detachable tubular magazine or magazines that can hold more than 5 cartridges * Magazines for shotguns that can hold more than 5 cartridges * Any magazine which can hold more than 10 cartridges * Parts of a prohibited firearm, including a component, that can be applied to enable, or take significant steps towards enabling, a firearm to be fired with, or near, a semi-automatic action. ===Other provisions=== The Act provides exemptions to import, sell, supply, and possess semi-automatic firearms for licensed dealers, employees of the Department of Conservation, people engaged in pest control, bona fide firearms collectors, directors or curators of bona fide museums, approved broadcasters, and bona fide theatre companies or societies, or film or television production companies. The Act offers an amnesty for prohibited firearms, magazines, and parts to be surrendered to licensed dealers and the New Zealand Police by 30 September 2019, later extended to 20 December 2019. The Act also introduces several new offenses and penalties ranging from two to ten years for various offenses including unlawful possession of prohibited firearms, magazines, and parts; importing prohibited items without a permit; carrying a prohibited item with criminal intent; and knowingly supplying or selling prohibited weapons and parts. ==History== ===Background=== Following the Christchurch mosque shootings on 15 March 2019, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern announced that the government would be changing New Zealand's gun laws. Attorney-General David Parker was later quoted as saying that the government would ban semi-automatic guns, but subsequently backtracked, saying that the government had not yet committed to anything and that regulations around semi-automatic weapons was \\"one of the issues\\" the government would consider. On 20 March 2019, Ardern announced that the government would ban all semi-automatic firearms and assault rifles and would also be introducing a buy-back scheme to remove all prohibited firearms from circulation. On 21 March, as an interim step, the government reclassified most semi-automatic firearms as \\"military style semi-automatic firearms\\" for the purpose of the Arms Act 1983, pursuant to section 74A(c) of the statute. ===First reading=== On 1 April 2019, the Minister of Revenue and Minister of Police Stuart Nash introduced the Arms Amendment Bill into parliament. It passed its first reading the following day and was referred to the Finance and Expenditure select committee. The proposed bill was supported by all parties except the opposition ACT Party. However, ACT's sole MP David Seymour was unable to vote since he had been talking to the media. ===Select committee stage=== On 3 April, the government also announced that it would be holding submissions on the Arms Amendment Bill until 6pm on 4 April 2019. Gun owners including the Council of Licenced Firearms Owners chairman Paul Clark, Guns NZ chief executive Jim Yates, and Deerstalkers Association spokesperson Bill O'Leary criticised the short submission time frame on the proposed law change. By the evening of 3 April, MPs had received thousands of submissions relating to the gun law. On 8 April, the Finance and Expenditure Select Committee recommended some minor changes to the Arms Amendment Bill including allowing pest controllers to use semi-automatic arms on private lands and allowing people to keep heirloom weapons. However, the committee rejected calls to exempt competitive shooters from the ban because that would allow more semi- automatic firearms to remain in circulation. In total, the committee received 13,062 submissions and 22 oral submissions: 60% supported the bill, 26% opposed the bill, while 14% expressed another opinion. The Act Party and New Zealand Law Society have both criticized the rapid passage of the legislation. ===Second and third readings=== On 9 April, the Gun Amendment Bill passed its second reading. The following day, the bill passed its third reading. The bill was supported by all parliamentary parties except the ACT Party's sole MP Seymour. Opposition National MP Judith Collins reiterated the National Party's support for the bill despite the party's failure to secure Firearms Prohibition Orders and an exemption in the bill for competitive shooting. In addition, the government announced a buyback scheme for prohibited firearms. Independent advisers will come up with a price list for the buyback scheme while a separate expert panel will determine fair compensation for high value firearms. Police Minister Stuart Nash has indicated that the buyback scheme could cost NZ$1 billion. The government included an out clause that it will not be compensating people who had obtained their arms illegally, but clarified that they would still be covered by the amnesty timeframe. ACT MP Seymour has called on the government to compensate gang members in order to convince them to surrender their arms. Nash announced that the Cabinet would consider the scheme's regulations and extending the amnesty by a month. On Thursday, 11 April 2019, the Governor-General of New Zealand, Patsy Reddy, signed the bill, officially enacting it into law, going into effect on 12 April 2019. ===Aftermath=== On 20 June, Finance Minister Robertson and Police Minister Nash launched the Government's six-month firearms buy-back amnesty, which would run until 20 December. The Government allocated NZ$200 million to the firearms buy-back scheme. Licensed firearms owners will be eligible for the scheme. There are four collection options for the government's buy-back scheme: large-scale events at centralised community locations; handing over items at approved gun dealers; bulk pickups by Police; and at Police stations. The New Zealand Police has organized a series of nationwide local collection events for gun owners to hand in prohibited firearms. By 22 July, over 2,000 guns had been handed in at buyback events in Auckland and Wellington over the past weekend. On 13 September 2019, Prime Minister Ardern and Police Minister Nash announced that the Government would be introducing an Arms Legislation Bill which would create a firearms register in order to stop the flow of guns to criminal groups. The bill was criticized by the opposition National Party and gun lobby groups, who claim it would punish lawful firearm owners and gun clubs. According to Al Jazeera and Reuters, more than 19,100 firearms and 70,800 gun accessories have been surrendered to the gun amnesty as of mid- September 2019. According to the Small Arms Survey, New Zealand is the 17th highest ranking country in terms of civilian gun ownership with a population of under 5 million and an estimated 1.5 million firearms. The buyback ended on 20 December 2019. During the buyback period, 56,250 firearms and 194,245 parts were surrendered to police, and 2,717 firearms were modified to meet the new legal standards. == References Category:2019 in New Zealand law Category:Christchurch mosque shootings Category:Firearm laws Category:Gun politics in New Zealand ","title":"Arms (Prohibited Firearms, Magazines, and Parts) Amendment Act 2019"},{"id":"60402311","text":"PQL, pql, or variation, may refer to: * Trent Lott International Airport (FAA id: PQL; IATA airport code: PGL; ICAO airport code: KPQL), Pascagoula, Jackson County, Mississippi, USA * The Porcupine's Quill (PQL) publishing company based in Erie, Ontario, Canada * Project Quantum Leap, a fictional time travel project from the TV series Quantum Leap * Process Query Language, a database query language * Papyrus Query Language, a proprietary query language for databases on the Papyrus Platform ==See also== * PQI (disambiguation) * PQ1 (disambiguation) ","title":"PQL (disambiguation)"},{"id":"60402339","text":"Anastasya Paramzina (; born 30 May 1998) is a Russian chess player who holds the title of Woman Grandmaster (WGM, 2019). ==Chess career== Anastasya Paramzina is Moscow chess school student.

In her childhood she moved from place to place, since her father was an officer and was moved to different barracks across the nation. All the while she studied in boarding schools to perfect her knowledge in French and art. After her schooling she felt drawn to the religious life (based on a vision she experienced when she was seven) and set herself on entering a convent after her father (who opposed this vocation) died. But ill health forced her to give up this idea and she instead founded a congregation of her own alongside several like-minded women who made the poor the focus of their apostolate. This congregation would spread within Spain (such as in Barcelona in 1900) and later across to other countries such as Portugal and Bolivia. Riquelme's cause for beatification was launched in Granada in 1982 when she was named a Servant of God. The cause was furthered on 14 December 2015 when Pope Francis named her as Venerable, upon confirming that she had practiced heroic virtue throughout her life. Francis also confirmed a miracle attributed to her intercession and she was beatified in Granada on 9 November 2019. ==Early life== María Emilia Riquelme y Zayas was born on 5 August 1847 in the house of her maternal grandparents in Granada, to the pious Joaquín Riquelme y Gómez (17 August 1812 - February 1885; he became a cadet aged thirteen and was a strong patriot) and María Emilia Zayas Fernández de Córdoba y de la Vega (13 July 1815 - 28 June 1855). Her parents married in 1846. Her father was a distinguished officer who advanced to the rank of Lieutenant General. Riquelme's maternal ancestor was Gonzalo Fernández de Córdoba who was known as \\"the Great Captain\\". Her father was disappointed with her birth since he wanted his firstborn to be a son who would continue his name and would serve as a cadet, but despite this came to love his daughter. Riquelme was baptized on 7 August 1847 in the Tabernacle parish (where her parents had married) as \\"María Emilia Joaquina Rosario Josefa Nieves de la Santísima Trinidad\\". Her parents had a son in 1849 named Joaquín (known also as Joaquinillo) which caused his father great happiness but that child – who became an ensign – died in Seville when he was seventeen, leaving his father without an heir and a son in the armed forces. In 1851 her father was sent to Navarre, where he went along with wife and daughter. Riquelme's mother died when she was seven. It was at this age that she experienced a vision of the Blessed Mother holding the Infant Jesus. This vision caused her to devote herself to God. She consecrated herself to the Virgen del Carmen, and in 1859 made a private vow to remain chaste. Riquelme had been the firstborn and her brother Joaquinillo followed in 1849. Her parents had a third child – Blanca Riquelme y Zayas – who was born in 1853 but died before Christmas in 1854. The couple then had their fourth child in 1854, who died not long after birth in Madrid. It was following the death of their pregnant mother (who died on 28 June 1855 in Granada due to an outbreak of cholera) that she and Joaquinillo moved with their father into the home of their maternal grandparents. On 5 August 1863 her father received an appointment to Madrid but Joaquinillo suffered from a chronic lung disease, and so Joaquín asked to be posted to the Canary Islands in the hope that his son would recover in a milder climate. But his condition worsened and so the three relocated to Seville where Joaquinillo died on 2 May 1866 (or 14 July 1865 as other sources suggest). It was after this that her father was sent to La Coruña where he was posted during the 1868 Liberal Revolution that saw the dethronement of Isabella II. Her father sent her to Madrid to live with his sister Pepa while he was sent into exile in Lisbon in Portugal. In her schooling she studied art and singing as well as piano, along with languages including French. She attended boarding schools in Seville and Madrid and finished her education at age fifteen, an expert rider and fluent in French. Riquelme lived in Pamplona and Tenerife with her father and then settled in La Coruña, his last posting before his exile to Lisbon. While in exile, he sent his daughter to live with relatives in Madrid. It was around this time that her diplomat cousin Eduardo Díaz del Moral y Riquelme and others began acting as suitors in the hopes of being wed to her. But Riquelme's religious vocation was then her primary concern and she refused these requests. It was also around this stage that her spiritual director was Marcelo Spínola y Maestre (future cardinal) in Seville, who advised her to associate with the Vincentians in their charitable works. On one occasion – when her father called her to Lisbon – she was involved in an automobile accident that left her unscathed and her father with cuts to his face. == Vocation == During her adolescence she ended up confiding her vocation to her father who was opposed to it and so arranged social events for her to attend in a vain effort to distract her. But she ignored most of these events set out for her and instead would visit hospitals and aid the poor. Funds that she received she distributed to women to keep them from prostitution or to men who felt called to enter the priesthood (one of those being the future Archbishop of Madrid Leopoldo Eijo y Garay). Riquelme's father died in February 1885 and so she tried entering the religious life at a convent but was forced to give up on this due to a series of health issues. It was following this that she constructed a small chapel at home with canonical approval and would spend her free time ministering to the poor. Her work with the poor soon attracted like- minded women to join her, leading to the religious congregation she would found. She established the Missionárias do Santíssimo Sacramento e Maria Imaculada in 1896. The Archbishop of Granada José Moreno y Mazón gave it archdiocesan approval in 1896 and from then until her death she served as its Superior General. On 25 March 1896 (the official founding of her congregation) she and seven others received the religious habit from the archbishop, with Riquelme making her perpetual profession as a religious sister. In 1900 she opened the congregation's second house in Barcelona and around that time founded a school for poor girls in Granada. During the following decade she traveled to Rome to obtain for the congregation the pontifical decree of praise and the official papal approval, received from Pope Pius X in 1912. In 1936 the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War forced her to flee to France to escape the anti-religious sentiment and persecution. She returned to Spain after the conflict. Riquelme died at her motherhouse in Granada on 10 December 1940. Her congregation would spread to countries across the globe such as Portugal and the United States of America. Her remains were later exhumed and relocated in 2008. ==Beatification== The beatification process commenced on 19 June 1982 after the Congregation for the Causes of Saints in Rome titled Riquelme as a Servant of God and issued the official \\"nihil obstat\\" (no objections) edict for the cause to begin. The Archbishop of Granada José Méndez Asensio inaugurated the cognitional process (the official investigation into her life and reputation for holiness) on 11 May 1983 and closed it on 28 April 1991. The C.C.S. validated the process on 14 March 1992 as having complied with their regulations in conducting causes. The postulators drafted and submitted the official Positio dossier to the C.C.S. officials in 1996 for further investigation. Theologians assessed the Positio and approved the cause on 18 May 2007. The C.C.S. cardinal and bishop members likewise met on 11 October 2011 but had to meet again on 1 December 2015 to further discuss it and give their approval to the cause. Riquelme became titled as Venerable on 14 December 2015 after Pope Francis signed a decree that acknowledged that she had practiced heroic virtue throughout her life. Riquelme's beatification depended upon the papal confirmation of a single miracle attributed to her intercession which in most cases would be a healing that would neither have a medical or scientific explanation. Such a case was investigated in Colombia before it was sent to the C.C.S. who validated that investigation on 8 February 2008. Medical experts confirmed confirmed the miraculous nature of the healing on 30 January 2018, and theologians on 12 October 2018 determined that the healing came from the intercession of Riquelme. The C.C.S. cardinal and bishop members on 5 March 2019 confirmed the healing was indeed a miracle. Pope Francis signed a decree on 19 March 2019 that acknowledged the miracle, leading to her beatification in Granada on 9 November 2019. The current postulator for this cause is Dr. Silvia Mónica Correale. ==References== ==External links== * Hagiography Circle * Saints SQPN * Ecclesia 75 digital Category:1847 births Category:1940 deaths Category:19th-century Spanish people Category:19th-century Spanish women Category:19th-century venerated Christians Category:20th-century Spanish people Category:20th-century Spanish women Category:20th-century venerated Christians Category:Beatifications by Pope Francis Category:Founders of Catholic religious communities Category:People from Granada Category:Spanish beatified people Category:Spanish female equestrians Category:Spanish Roman Catholic religious sisters and nuns Category:Superiors general Category:Venerated Catholics by Pope Francis Category:Visions of Jesus and Mary ","title":"María Emilia Riquelme y Zayas"},{"id":"60402460","text":"The South Eastern Health and Social Care Trust (SEHSCT) is a health organisation in Northern Ireland.

Both nations are members of the Council of Europe, European Union, OECD and the United Nations. == Historical relationships == The historical relations between Austria and Spain are mainly defined by the House of Habsburg's dominance of the Spanish monarchy in the 16th and 17th centuries; from the Treaty of Villafáfila (27 June 1506), in which Felipe I the Beautiful was recognized as king jure uxoris of the Crown of Castile, leaving the Crown of Aragon for his father-in-law, Ferdinand the Catholic; until the death without direct succession of Carlos II the Bewitched (1 November 1700), which provoked the War of Spanish Succession. During the so-called Austrias mayores (Carlos I and Felipe II), Spain reached the apogee of its influence and power, especially with the incorporation of Portugal and its extensive empire. Conversely, the reigns of the so-called Lesser Austrias (Philip III, Felipe IV and Carlos II), coinciding with the height of the Spanish Golden Age in art and literature, led to what is known as \\"Spanish decadence\\": the loss of European hegemony and a deep economic and social crisis. == Diplomatic relations == Relations between Spain and Austria are excellent according to the Spanish Ministry of Foreign Affairs, there being no significant disputes or bilateral tensions or radically different positions on major issues within or outside the scope of the European Union, to which both countries belong . During the formation of the government of Mariano Rajoy, Austria has shown understanding and interest in the profound reforms carried out in Spain, supporting them within the community framework.Ficha de Austria Oficina de Información Diplomática. Ministerio de Asuntos Exteriores y Cooperación. Relaciones diplomáticas. == Economic relations == The growth of bilateral commercial relations and the overcoming of Spanish imports from Austria by exports from 2011 have been the dominant note in the economic field, together with the good results of tourism, in constant expansion. However, the Spanish investment suffered a severe blow in 2013 with the insolvency of Alpine Bau (100% subsidiary of the FCC), the largest bankruptcy in Austria by volume since II World War, which has meant the parent company losses of about 1,000 million euros. The bilateral trade registered in 2011 for the first time a favorable surplus to Spain, with an export growth of 21.6%. The Spanish investment accumulated in Austria, about 1,400 million euros in 2012, focused mainly on infrastructure (FCC), hotel (Hotusa and NH), and confection (Inditex and Mango) and metal pipes (Tubacex).Ficha de Austria Oficina de Información Diplomática.

When war broke out in August 1914, he volunteered to fight and was soon incorporated into the French Foreign Legion. He was killed during the Artois offensive in May 1915. Partly because he had chosen to adopt a Colombian passport over a French one, Bengoechea's death was widely reported and mourned in Colombia.Article Although fluent in both Spanish and French, Bengoechea wrote mainly in French. His poems are available in a volume entitled Les Crépuscules du matin. He left around forty letters from the front, which dealt with subjects such as life in the trenches, his love of Paris, France, and the French language, his desire to maintain an intellectual life in spite of his harsh circumstances, etc. The main recipients were his mother, his brother Alfred, his sister Elvira, the brothers García Calderón, his best friend Diego Suárez Costa, Baroness Renée Franchon, Countess Moltke-Huitfeld, etc. One of his correspondents was Jose Garcia Calderon, a young writer of Peruvian origin, who also died in action, a year after Bengoechea's death. Hernando's elder brother, Alfred de Bengoechea, a poet and translator, published his letters after the war, in a volume entitled Le Sourire de l'Ile-de-France : Essais et poèmes en prose, suivis des Lettres de guerre, 1914-1915. This book, illustrated by E.-A. Bourdelle, appeared in 1924. Twenty-four years later, in 1948, Alfred published a selection of the works of his dead brother, with a long preface by Hernando's friend, Léon-Paul Fargue (also a poet), under the title: Hernando de Bengoechea ou l’Âme d’un poète. ==References== Category:20th-century Colombian poets Category:20th-century French poets Category:1889 births Category:1915 deaths Category:Colombian male poets Category:French male poets ","title":"Hernando de Bengoechea"},{"id":"60402551","text":"Silaberia (also spelled as Sillaberya, Shilla Berya) is a village in Khejuri II CD block in Contai subdivision of Purba Medinipur district in the state of West Bengal, India. ==Geography== ===Location=== Silaberia is located at . ===Urbanisation=== 93.55% of the population of Contai subdivision live in the rural areas.

It is based in the former Koninklijk Weeshuis in Buren, originally opened as an orphanage on 26 May 1612 by Maria van Nassau and remaining in that role until 1953. It is the oldest police museum in the Netherlands and on 7 December 2005 was added to the 'Museumregister Nederland'. It and four other major Dutch military museums are overseen by the Koninklijke Stichting Defensiemusea. ==History== It was set up by M.C. van Houten (colonel of the Royal Marechaussee) as the 'Royal Marechaussee historical museum' (historisch museum der Koninklijke Marechaussee) in Apeldoorn, opening on 31 October 1936. The initial core of the museum collection was Van Houten's own private collection. After 1945 the museum was housed in both the Leger en Wapen museum 'Generaal Hoefer' (of which Van Houten was then director) and the Pesthuis in Leiden. It was then moved to the Koninklijke Stallen (Royal Stables) in 's-Gravenshage (1957-1959) and then to the top floor of the Marechausseebrigade buildings at 12 Westersingel in Rotterdam (19 March 1959 – 10 April 1972). It has been in its present home since 10 April 1972, rented from its owners on the condition that part of the displays still told the history of the orphanage. A nearby former municipal sports hall was purchased in 2000 and opened on 12 April 2003 as a vehicles display space. == Displays == Display topics include brigades, brigade offices, brigade stables, vehicles, brigade stables, commanders, inspectors, other historical figures, the BSB and former organisations such as the Korps Politietroepen, the Rijksveldwacht, the Gemeenteveldwacht, the Rijkspolitie and the Gemeentepolitie.

The football squad competes in the Mornington Peninsula Nepean Football League (MPNFL). Frankston has been responsible for the development of Australian football on the Mornington Peninsula since 1887. ==History== It is believed that J.C. \\"Jack\\" Sadleir was the founder of the club in 1887. The first reported match took place against Mornington. Frankston won the game by 4 goals to Nil. Games were arranged between a group of teams across the Peninsula including Hastings and Mornington. Sadleir brought with him the black with red sash guernsey. In the early years & right into the mid 1900s Frankston was known as the “Red and Blacks.” ===Peninsula Football Association=== Frankston was one of five founding members of the Peninsula Football Association in 1908. In the inaugural season It lost the first Grand Final to Hastings. Frankston were Premiers in 1911, 1919, 1922, 1923, and 1931. ===Mornington Peninsula Football League=== At the end of the 1933 season the Peninsula Football Association merged with the Peninsula District Football Association to form the Mornington Peninsula Football League. Frankston were MPFL Premiers in 1937, 1938, 1939, 1941, 1949, 1952 and 1961. ===Victorian Football Association=== In 1966, Frankston entered the Victorian Football Association Second Division. Its departure from the MPFL was acrimonious, with the MPFL refusing on three occasions over two years to grant the club the necessary clearance. In 1966 Frankston separated to form two clubs. Frankston (Later to become Frankston Dolphins) join the VFA, & Frankston Peninsula (Later to become Frankston Bombers) would continue to play in the MPFL. In 1975 Frankston Peninsula & Frankston Rovers amalgamate to become the Frankston Bombers Football Club. ===Frankston Rovers=== The Rovers formed and were originally called Bruce Park in 1963, they renamed themselves the Frankston Rovers in 1966. The club struggled on-field until it merged with the Frankston Peninsula to form the Frankston Bombers in 1975. ===Post merger=== In 1981 the new clubrooms at Baxter Park were opened. The club has won two premierships since the merger, 1991 and 2009. ==Premierships== * 1911, 1919, 1922, 1923, 1929, 1931, 1937, 1938, 1939, 1941, 1946, 1947, 1949, 1952, 1961, 1991, 2009 ==References== ==External links== * Official site Category:Australian rules football clubs in Victoria (Australia) Category:1975 establishments in Australia Category:Mornington Peninsula Nepean Football League Category:Netball teams in Victoria (Australia) ","title":"Frankston Football Netball Club"},{"id":"60402727","text":":For a statistical breakdown by season, see List of Molde FK seasons Molde Fotballklubb is a football club from Molde, Norway. It was established in 1911 as International by a group of people gathered by Klaus Daae Andersen. After permission was granted, it took the current name and joined the league system in 1928. Until 1937, Molde played in regional leagues, after numerous promotions and relegations. Since 1930, the team has played in the Norwegian Football Cup. In 1939, the club joined the third season of the League of Norway, the top division, but the break-out of the World War II caused a halt to all organized sports and thus this season was never completed. In 1947–48, Molde played their first full season in the top division. They finished third in the District VII table, but was relegated to the second tier due to a reconstruction of the league system. Molde then played nine consecutive seasons on the second tier (1.divisjon and Landsdelsserien) before promoting to the 1957–58 Hovedserien. Molde won only one of their fourteen games back in the top division, and was relegated after finishing in seventh place out of eight teams in Hovedserien's group B. The club's first trophy was won in 1994, when Molde defeated Lyn 3–2 in the 1994 Norwegian Cup final. Molde won their second Norwegian Cup in 2005. In 2011, in the 100th anniversary of the club, Molde won their first league title. They defended the title in 2012. In 2013, Molde won their third Norwegian Cup by winning 4–2 against main rivals Rosenborg. Molde won their first double in 2014. The club had limited success in the UEFA tournaments, never coming past the group stage, until reaching the round of 32 of the Europa League in the 2015–16 season. The success during the 2010s has largely been credited to manager Ole Gunnar Solskjær, who managed the club in the years 2011–2013 and 2015–2018 before he became manager of Manchester United. ==International== The club was founded by a group of people gathered at Utstillingsplassen in Molde by Klaus Daae Andersen on 19 June 1911. 32 men became members of the club that day and J. Ferdinand Dahl was elected as the club's first chairman. On a general election on 24 April 1912, it was decided that the club would be named International, perhaps because the opponents were primarily visitors from cruise ships or trading vessels, or that it was to make room for the many Danes who worked in the Gideon engine factory. On 5 August 2012, the club played its first competitive match, an away match against Kristiansund which ended 2–2. Molde's first home game was played on 22 September 1912, again was Kristiansund their opponent. Tickets to the game were sold for NOK 0.25, and the club organized a dance party after the game. International was one of the six founding clubs in Romsdals Fotballkrets which was founded on 28 June 1914. The rising interest and activity in football in neighbouring towns caused the club to change its name to Molde Fotballklubb in 1915. ==Name change and financial problems== At the club's annual general meeting in 1915, the club changed its name to Molde Fotballklubb. During the World War I, Molde played few games due to lack of money, problems with their pitch and that eight of their players were called up to military duty. The poor economic situation in Molde Fotballklubb saw a change after a successful market held by the club in 1919. Molde got new kits in 1920; blue with white cuffs. It was also decided that the club should have a crest. Molde debuted in the Norwegian Cup in 1921. Their first match was lost 1–2 against Rollon in the qualifying round of the 1921 Norwegian Cup. The club played its first season in the top division in 1939–40, but the season was abandoned due to the German occupation and was never completed. Molde's first full season was the first post-war season in 1947–48. They finished third in the District VII table, but was relegated to the second tier due to a reconstruction of the league system. Molde then played nine consecutive seasons on the second tier (1.divisjon and Landsdelsserien) before promoting to the 1957–58 Hovedserien. Until 1955, Molde FK had been playing their games at Rivalbanen. This year, Molde moved to their new stadium, Molde Stadion, which opened on 28 August 1955 with a second tier league match between Molde FK and Kristiansund FK. Arne Hemnes scored the first and only goal of the game, thus the home team won 1–0. Approximately 2,500 spectators attended the opening game. Molde won only one of their fourteen games back in their top division comeback in, 1957–58 and was relegated after finishing in seventh place out of eight teams in Hovedserien's group B. The club went on to play four consecutive seasons on the second tier before they were further relegated to 3. divisjon ahead of the 1963 season. ==The breakthrough (1964–77)== On 2 August 1964, Molde shocked nine-time Norwegian Cup champions and nine-time Norwegian League Champions Fredrikstad by eliminating them from the 1964 Norwegian Cup in the third round with a 3–2 win at home. Jan Fuglset, Torkild Brakstad, Odd Berg and Harry Hestad, amongst others, played at Molde during this period. The club played in local lower leagues, save for a short visit in the top division in the 1957–58 season. In 1970, Molde was promoted to the second tier and played there for three seasons until its promotion to the top flight with a 5–1 away win against Sogndal on 16 September 1973. In 1974, Molde returned to the top division following the debut of several talented players in the first team, which coincided with the return of top level players like Fuglset, Brakstad and Hestad. Molde shocked the established clubs in their first season of the 1. divisjon, leading the league in 9 of 22 matchdays. Ahead of the final match of the season, Molde would win the league if they defeated Sarpsborg and Viking lost against Strømsgodset. However, both Molde and Viking won their last match, meaning Molde won the silver medal after finishing one point behind champions Viking. Odd Berg scored 13 goals in the league and became Molde's first top scorer in the top division. Due to their second-place finish in the league in 1974, Molde was qualified for the 1975–76 UEFA Cup. The club's first game in a UEFA competition was played on 17 September 1975. Molde won the UEFA Cup first round first leg 1–0 at home against Swedish opponent Öster. Kjell Westerdahl scored the goal at Molde Idrettspark. Molde lost the second leg 0–6, the biggest defeat in UEFA competitions in the club's history, and was knocked out of the UEFA Cup with 1–6 on aggregate. ==Ups and downs (1978–93)== Between 1978 and 1984, Molde did not play on the same level in two consecutive years. Molde was relegated from the 1. divisjon in every even-numbered year, and promoted to back to the first tier in every odd-numbered year, making it three consecutive promotions and relegations. In fact, Molde and Brann did not play at the same level these years, as Brann were promoted when Molde was relegated and the other way around. In 1982, Molde played in their first cup final, despite being relegated from the 1982 1. divisjon. They lost the final at Ullevaal Stadion 3–2 against Brann. The 1987 season was the closest Molde came to winning the league championship before winning it in 2011, when a draw at home against Moss in the final round would have ensured the title. Despite numerous goal scoring opportunities, Moss won the match 2–0 at Molde stadium, thus winning the league championship, while Molde won their second silver medal. The attendance of 14,615 set the record at the old Molde stadion. Molde played their second cup final in 1989. The first match against Viking ended in a 2–2 draw, and the subsequent replay was won 2–1 by Viking. When Molde again was relegated from the Norwegian top flight in 1993, the club was in major economic difficulties following a number of projects, the most notably of which was an expansion of the main stand at Molde stadion. Local businessmen Kjell Inge Røkke and Bjørn Rune Gjelsten started to invest in the club, and since 1993 they have invested approximately on old debts, new players and the new stadium. ==The silver generation (1994–2000)== ===First trophy=== Åge Hareide was the head coach of Molde in the 1994 season, when they finished second in their 1. divisjon group and was thus re-promoted to Tippeligaen. Molde finished four points behind group B winners Hødd. Molde also met their main rivals Rosenborg in the semi-final of the 1994 Norwegian Cup. Molde won 2–1 at home and drew 2–2 in Trondheim, and with a 4–3 win on aggregate, Molde qualified for their third cup final. After having lost to Molde, Rosenborg head coach Nils Arne Eggen called Molde's playing style for \\"arse-football\\" (\\"rævvafotball\\"). Molde won their first title by defeating Lyn 3–2 in the final at Ullevaal Stadium in Oslo. Tarje Nordstrand Jacobsen, Ole Bjørn Sundgot and Arild Stavrum scored Molde's goals in the final. ===Three S's=== Molde striker Ole Gunnar Solskjær was signed by Manchester United after his successful two-season spell at Molde During the 1995 season, Molde became known for their three strikers, known as the three S's due to their surname's first letters: Ole Gunnar Solskjær, Arild Stavrum and Ole Bjørn Sundgot. In their first league match, Molde won 6–0 against Brann in Bergen, with Solskjær scoring two goals and Stavrum and Sundgot also contributing in one of Brann's heaviest-ever losses at home. With six-straight wins, Molde stayed in the top two positions of the league throughout the season, but eventually finished second, 15 points behind Rosenborg. Solskjær scored 31 goals in 42 matches for Molde and was sold to Manchester United on 29 July 1996 as Molde finished in eighth position that season. In 1997, Molde finished fourth in the league, and Erik Brakstad replaced Åge Hareide as head coach ahead of the 1998 season. ===New stadium=== In the 1998 season, Molde moved to the new Molde Stadion. The opening game was played on 18 April against Lillestrøm, a game Molde won 4–0. Molde played their first 21 matches without losing, a Norwegian record until 2009, when Rosenborg went 26 matches undefeated. In the 22nd round, Molde lost against Vålerenga while Rosenborg defeated Kongsvinger to surpass Molde at the top of the table. Rosenborg player Mini Jakobsen subsequently said, \\"It was fun as long as you managed to keep up. Thank you for helping to create tension in Tippeligaen!\\" On 26 September 1998, Rosenborg won 2–0 against Molde in the 23rd round and won the championship, with Molde settling for second place. Molde scored a club record 70 goals in the 1998 Tippeligaen. The all-time attendance record at Aker Stadion dates from the 1998 rivalry game against Rosenborg on 26 September 1998, which was followed by 13,308 spectators. ===Champions League=== In the 1999 season, Molde had a successful season, finishing second in the league and reaching the semi-final of the 1999 Norwegian Cup, where they were eliminated by Brann. Molde also participated in the UEFA Champions League, where Molde was drawn against CSKA Moscow in the second qualifying round. In the first match in Moscow, Molde lost 2–0, while in the second leg, 19-year-old Magne Hoseth had his big break-through with two goals when CSKA was defeated 4–0 to send Molde to the third qualifying round, where they met Mallorca. The first leg against Mallorca ended 0–0 at home. Away at Mallorca were Molde one goal behind for a long time, but Andreas Lund became the big hero when he equalized on a penaltyin the 84th minute. With a 1–1 aggregate score, Molde qualified for the group stage on away goals, and Molde became the team from the smallest city to have qualified for the group stage of Champions League until Unirea Urziceni repeated the feat in 2009–10. In the group stage, Molde were drawn against Real Madrid, Porto and Olympiacos, and with one 3–2 home win against Olympiacos and five losses, Molde finished last in their group. On the occasion of Molde's 100-year anniversary in 2011, the readers of the local newspaper Romsdals Budstikke voted 1999 as the best year in the history of the club. ==From \\"Gunder method\\" to relegation (2001–2006)== On 6 November 2000, after the sacking of Erik Brakstad, Gunder Bengtsson was announced head coach for two years. After one season, Bengtsson and his assistant Kalle Björklund were signed for three more years. In 2002, Gunder Bengtsson led Molde to second place in the league, but like when he won the league with Vålerenga in 1983 and 1984, there was not much enthusiasm around the club's sixth silver medal because of the defensive tactics and lack of local players in the squad. In the first six matches of the 2003 season, Molde collected five points. On 22 May 2003, Bengtsson was fired and replaced by Odd Berg. In the third round of 2003 Norwegian Cup, Molde were eliminated by second-tier club Skeid. Despite the change in the coaching staff, Molde was struggling in the relegation zone throughout the season, but after a 3–2 win away against Sogndal in the last match of the season, Molde avoided the relegation playoffs. In 2004, the team led by Reidar Vågnes, former assistant coach under Erik Brakstad, but Molde only managed 11th place, four points clear of relegation. In 2005, Bo Johansson became head coach of Molde, and on 15 June 2005, Molde won 3–2 against Nybergsund to qualify for the fourth round of the Norwegian Cup, having lost in the third round for three consecutive years. Molde finished 12th in the league and had to play in the relegation playoff against Moss, which Molde won 5–2 on aggregate. Molde won their second Norwegian Cup title on 6 November 2005 when they won 4–2 after extra time against Lillestrøm in the final. Bo Johansson left Molde after only one season with the club, and on Christmas Eve, Arild Stavrum was announced as the new head coach. Following the Norwegian Cup champions, Molde played in the 2006–07 UEFA Cup. On 25 August 2006, they were drawn to face Scottish giants Rangers in the first round. They were eliminated 2–0 on aggregate after holding Rangers to a 0–0 draw at the Aker Stadion. The same year, Molde was relegated, having been in the relegation zone for the last four seasons. The relegation became final after losing 8–0 against Stabæk at Nadderud in the second-last match of the season. Arild Stavrum was fired at the end of the season. ==A new era, Solskjær and success (2007–present)== Daniel Berg Hestad played 23 seasons for Molde In December 2006, Kjell Jonevret became head coach after Stavrum was fired, though Ove Christensen was the club's first choice. With Jonevret as coach, Molde won the 2007 1. divisjon and won promotion back to the top division after one season's absence. After the promotion, Molde recorded a 5–1 win against Vålerenga on the last day of Moldejazz 2008, as well as eliminating Brann from the cup with an impressive 8–0 win at home four days later. Regardless of these strong results, Molde finished ninth in their comeback season in the top flight. Molde was again the second-best team in Norway in 2009 after champions Rosenborg, who that season overtook Molde's 1998 unbeaten streak record. Conversely, Molde ruined Rosenborg's march for the double with a 5–0 win at Aker Stadion in the quarter-final of 2009 Norwegian Cup. In the final, Molde met their local rivals Aalesunds FK in a game that finished 2–2 after extra time, but Aalesund won the Norwegian Championship on penalty shoot-out. After only 20 points during the first 22 matches in the 2010 Tippeligaen, Kjell Jonevret was sacked and replaced by Uwe Rösler. Under Rösler, Molde collected 20 points in the last eight matches and avoided relegation. Despite the poor performance by the team, Baye Djiby Fall, who spent the season on loan from Lokomotiv Moscow, became the first Molde player since Jan Fuglset in 1976 to be the top goalscorer in Eliteserien. ===Solskjær I=== Prior to the club's 100-year anniversary in 2011, former Molde and Manchester United player Ole Gunnar Solskjær returned to Molde to manage the club. In the opening match of 2011 Tippeligaen, his first competitive match, Molde lost 3–0 away against newly promoted Sarpsborg 08. On 19 June 2011, Molde celebrated their 100th anniversary with a 2–0 win against Sogndal and positioned themselves at the top of the league table. Molde held on to their lead until they eventually won their first championship. On 30 October 2011, Molde could win the league with three points at home against Strømsgodset, but the game ended with a 2–2 draw after Molde had taken the lead twice through goals from Magne Simonsen and Magnus Wolff Eikrem. However, Molde won the league later that evening, when Rosenborg, the only team that could mathematically have still beaten them to first place with two matches remaining, lost 6–3 at home to Brann. Molde successfully defended their title in 2012 by beating Hønefoss 1–0 on 11 November, with one match remaining of the season. Although Molde could only finish sixth behind champions Strømgodset in the 2013 Tippeligaen, they defeated Rosenborg 4–2 in the 2013 Norwegian Cup final on 24 November to win the Norwegian Cup for the third time in their history. Ole Gunnar Solskjær left the club to sign for Premier League side Cardiff City on 2 January 2014. ===League and Cup double=== In the 2014 season, Molde won their first ever domestic league and cup double under new manager Tor Ole Skullerud. Molde were unbeaten for 24 league games from 13 April to 4 October, a club record. On 4 October, the league title was won with four games to spare after a 2–1 away win against Viking. Björn Bergmann Sigurðarson scored the decisive goal in the 78th minute of the game. The team ended the season with 71 points, a league record, and finished 11 points ahead of Rosenborg. The double was secured on 23 November when Odd was defeated 2–0 in the Norwegian Cup final. Fredrik Gulbrandsen and Mohamed Elyounoussi were the goalscorers, both in the second half. Despite the club's success in 2014, Skullerud was sacked in August 2015 due to a run of mediocre results. ===Solskjær II=== Solskjær, whose run at Cardiff lasted just nine months, was brought back to the team on 21 October 2015. Molde advanced from their group in the 2015–16 UEFA Europa League, finishing Group A in first place ahead of Fenerbahçe, Ajax and Celtic. They lost 3–1 on aggregate to Sevilla after losing 3–0 away and winning 1–0 at home. The home game second leg of the tie, was Daniel Berg Hestad's 666th and final game for the club. Molde finished in silver medal position in Eliteserien in both 2017 and 2018. On 19 December 2018 Solskjær left the club to join Manchester United as caretaker manager, with Øystein Neerland stating that Solskjær left on a loan deal for the remainder of the season. Solskjær's second spell as Molde manager was officially ended on 28 March 2019, when he was announced as full-time manager at Manchester United. ==Post-Solskjær success== Erling Moe is the current manager of the club since taking over as a caretaker manager on 19 December 2018 when Ole Gunnar Solskjær left the position to manage Manchester United as a caretaker manager. On 29 April 2019 it was announced that Moe signed a contract as permanent head coach till the end of the 2020 season. Under Moe's lead, Molde brought in several key players with Eliteserien routine ahead of the 2019 season, such as Martin Bjørnbak, Ohi Omoijuanfo, Kristoffer Haraldseid and Erling Knudtzon. On 10 November 2019, the club won its fourth league title following their 4–0 home win against Strømsgodset in the 28th round. ==References== Category:Molde FK Molde FK history Molde FK ","title":"History of Molde FK"},{"id":"60402745","text":"Itumeleng Robinson Moshobane (born 17 September 1994) - known as Tumi Moshobane - is a South African footballer who plays as a midfielder for San Diego Loyal in the USL Championship. ==Career== ===College=== On August 31st 2015, Moshobane debuted for NJCAA side Kankakee Cavaliers.

It's not a done deal. \\"Bollocks to Brexit\\" is a meme and grassroots campaign slogan used by people opposing Brexit, following the result of a 2016 referendum. The slogan has received media coverage and legal attention, as well as being used by the Liberal Democrats. ==Merchandise== The phrase has been printed on yellow fluorescent stickers (reading \\"Bollocks to Brexit – It's not a done deal\\"), which have been prominently circulated and displayed on anti-Brexit marches, including the People's Vote march in London on 23 March 2019. The stickers have also been handed out at major political party conferences in the UK. The New European, a newspaper supporting Britain remaining in the EU, offers a free \\"Bollocks to Brexit\\" mug with a subscription. A \\"Bollocks to Brexit\\" bus, parodying the Vote Leave campaign bus that appeared during the 2016 referendum, toured the UK and Ireland in 2018. The bus has made stops in Maidenhead, Uxbridge and Islington, constituencies of Prime Ministers Theresa May and Boris Johnson, as well as leader of the opposition Jeremy Corbyn. It was inadvertently shown on television after it appeared in the background of an ITV News broadcast. More recently, three minis have been decorated with the slogan \\"Bollocks to Brexit\\", and prior to the 2019 United Kingdom general election are being driven around the UK with the aim of promoting tactical voting. In the run-up to the 2019 EU elections, the Liberal Democrats leader Vince Cable adopted the phrase to be the title of their party manifesto. The party's newly elected MEPs wore the slogan on the back of T-shirts at the opening of European Parliament. ==Controversy== The phrase, and merchandise featuring it, has attracted legal attention. In March 2018, the Speaker of the House of Commons, John Bercow was criticised by the Conservative MP and Leave Means Leave advocate Andrew Bridgen for appearing to display a \\"Bollocks to Brexit\\" sign in his car. Bercow said that the car belonged to his wife Sally and he could not be held directly responsible for her thoughts and opinions. In October 2018, Charlie Mullins, founder of Pimlico Plumbers and former Conservative Party donor, was ordered by the local council to take down a large \\"Bollocks to Brexit\\" sign on top of a company building in Waterloo, London. Commuters complained that the sign was distracting and irrelevant to the business, but Mullins defended his right to free speech and the sign remained in place. In March 2019, a man was detained at Gatwick Airport after he refused to remove a \\"Bollocks to Brexit\\" badge upon attempting to board a flight. The same month, a protester on the People's Vote march attached a \\"Bollocks to Brexit\\" sticker to the front nameplate of the Department for International Trade office in Whitehall in protest at the department secretary, Liam Fox. A woman was refused entrance to the Adelphi Theatre because she was wearing a \\"Bollocks to Brexit\\" badge. Having commenced on the 'mini tour' to promote tactical voting in the 2019 UK General Election, the driver of one of three minis was stopped by an Essex Police officer in November 2019. The officer insisted that the slogan must be removed from the vehicle. ==ReferencesEU Flag Mafia - marketer of \\"Bollocks to Brexit\\" stickers Category:Brexit Category:Obscenity controversies Category:Political controversies Category:Pro-Europeanism in the United Kingdom Category:Words coined in the 2010s ","title":"Bollocks to Brexit"},{"id":"60402762","text":"Francisca de Haan is a Dutch historian and writer who specializes in women's and gender history.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1996. ==History== In the late 19th century, this section of Battle Creek lay between the commercial center of the city and the most prestigious residential neighborhoods. As such, what is now the Van Buren Street Historic District became the location of some of the city's oldest cultural institutions. This began in 1847 and 1858, when the first high school and St. Thomas Episcopal church were constructed in the district, on sites that now house current buildings for the same organizations. The 1870s brought the construction of successor buildings for both the high school and Episcopalian church, as well as a new St. Philip Catholic Church. In the 1880s the Michigan Central Railroad constructed a new depot. By the 1930s, the district was home to four churches, a public junior high and a Catholic school, and the local YMCA. ==Description== The Van Buren Street Historic District contains 22 buildings and structures, of which 19 contribute to the historic character of the neighborhood. Most of the buildings are large public and cultural structures, including churches, schools, and a railroad depot; three houses are also included. The structures are mostly located within a block of the intersection of Van Buren Street and Capital Streets. Buildings in the district include: *Williard Memorial Library (7 W. Van Buren) *St. Thomas Episcopal Church (66 Capital NE) *YMCA Building (77 Capital NE) *St Philip Catholic Church complex (92 Capital NE): This includes seven buildings: the main church, a rectory, the Grotto of Our Lady of Lourdes, an elementary school, high school, convent, fine arts building, and the American Marsh Pumps Pattern Building, purchased by the church in the 1960s. *Farley Funeral Home (105 Capital NE) *First Presbyterian Church (115 Capital NE) *Shaw Funeral Home (121 Capital NE) *David Cady House (130 Capital NE) *First Congregation Church (145 Capital NE) *Michigan Central Railroad Station (44 N.

Yuki no Kata (ゆきの方) or Oyuki (おゆき), was a Japanese female warrior (Onna-bugeisha) from the Sengoku period. She was the wife of Tomita Nobutaka, an officer of Toyotomi Hideyoshi. Her birth and death are not recorded. Portrayed in current records as beautiful and highly skilled warrior, she defended the Anōtsu castle in the Battle of Sekigahara. == Battle of Anōtsu castle == Anotsu castle tower. Yuki no Kata and Nobutaka sided with Tokugawa Ieyasu from the Eastern Army when Japan was prepared for the Sekigahara campaign. Nobutaka and his forces were summoned away to aid Ieyasu in punishing Uesugi Kagekatsu as Ishida Mitsunari prepared to attack the western roads towards Edo, Ieyasu's stronghold. The Anōtsu castle was right along the Western Army's path towards Ieyasu, so Yuki no kata took the lead in defending the castle. Since her castle was supposed to be one of the first to be attacked during the campaign, Yuki no kata armed herself, went to the castle walls and summoned the remaining soldiers to the war. Upon learning of Mitsunari's movements, Nobutaka rushed back to protect the Anōtsu castle, but was delayed by Kuki Yoshitaka.He arrived in time before the western forces led by Mōri Terumoto, Chōsokabe Morichika, and Nabeshima Katsushige reached Anōtsu. Armed with only 1,700 troops, Yuki no Kata and their allies defended themselves against the western alliance force of 30,000; the battle officially began on October 1, 1600. Although the 1300 defenders put up a stiff defense, the 30,000 attackers largely burned the castle down around them. In the heat of combat, Nobutaka was cut off from his allies in pursuit of an injured enemy officer. To save her husband, Yuki no Kata drove some of the opposing soldiers away using a naginata. So great was her attack that the enemy mistook her for a formal samurai warrior, only one with a face far too fair. Having saved Nobutaka, their forces withdrew back into the castle for the night when negotiations began. Terumoto allowed the defenders to flee at night out of respect for their bravery against such overwhelming odds. The Tomita clan were rewarded for their loyalty by the Tokugawa shogunate and were given an increase in revenue and rebuilt parts of the castle by the time they were transferred to Uwajima Domain in Iyo Province in 1608. Yuki no Kata is no longer mentioned in historical records after Ieyasu defeated Mitsunari in Sekigahara. == References == Category:People of Sengoku-period Japan Category:Women of medieval Japan Category:Japanese women in warfare Category:16th-century Japanese people Category:Women in 16th-century warfare Category:16th-century Japanese women Category:17th-century Japanese women Category:16th-century women rulers Category:Women in 17th-century warfare ","title":"Yuki no Kata"},{"id":"60403042","text":"The Fuzhou Confucian Temple (), more commonly known as Xianshi Temple () or Temple of Saints (), is a Confucian temple located in Fuzhou, Fujian. ==History== The temple was originally built in 773 by Li Yi (), an official in the Tang Empire (618-907).

In September 1970 the Lord Mayor of Cork opened the new club pavilion which today houses the club bar. In the 1970s a new playing pitch was developed, which became the first \\"grit\\" playing surface in the Republic of Ireland. More land was purchased and car parking and the pavilion were extended to include two new dressing rooms, a function hall and a kitchen. The grit pitch was converted into a sand based astroturf surface in 1987, the second of its kind in the Republic. In the 1980s and 1990s more land was purchased from Murphy's Caravan Park and from the Rolf family to increase the size of the facility. A second astroturf pitch was constructed in 1998. The first astroturf pitch fell into disrepair and was used as a car park for a period of time. The club now has two functioning field hockey pitches as well as cricket facilities. ==Notable players== ===Men's field hockey internationals=== ; { - style=\\"vertical-align:top\\"  * Ivan Bateman * Wesley Bateman * Jason Black * Mark Black * David Eakins  * Philip Hardy * Conor Harte * David Harte * Paul Lombard * Brian Long  * Sean Nicholson * Alan O'Driscoll * David O'Driscoll * Ian O'Keefe } ===Women's field hockey internationals=== ; When Ireland won the silver medal at the 2018 Women's Hockey World Cup, the squad included two Cork Harlequins players, Yvonne O'Byrne and Roisin Upton. { - style=\\"vertical-align:top\\"  * Rebecca Barry * Emma Buckley * Naomi Carroll * Eimear Cregan * Aoife Falvey  * Mary Goode * Sharon Hutchinson * Sarah Kelleher * Rachel Kohler * Sinead McCarthy  * Karen O'Brien * Yvonne O'Byrne * Julia O'Halloran * Cliodhna Sargent * Roisin Upton } ==Honours== ;Men's field hockey *European Cup Winners Trophy **Winners: 2007: 1 *All-Ireland Club Championship **Winners: 2002: 1 *Irish Senior Cup **Winners: 2006, 2012: 2 **Runners Up: 1938, 1950, 1991, 1995, 2003, 2004: 6 *Irish Junior Cup **Winners: 1999: 1 **Runners Up: 1930, 1979, 1988, 1991, 1997, 2005, 2007: 7 ;Women's field hockey *European Cup Winners Cup B Division **Winners: 2001 *Women's Irish Hockey League **Runners Up: 2009–10, 2017–18 *EY Champions Trophy **Runners Up: 2018 *Irish Senior Cup **Winners: 2000, 2018-19 **Runners Up: 2003, 2017 *Irish Junior Cup **Winners: 1990, 1992 ==References== ==External links== * Cork Harlequins on Facebook * Cork Harlequins on Twitter Category:Women's Irish Hockey League teams Category:1925 establishments in Ireland Category:Field hockey clubs established in 1925 Harlequins Category:Cricket clubs in Munster Category:Cricket in County Cork ","title":"Cork Harlequins"},{"id":"60403367","text":"Robert Heindl (24 July 1883 - 25 September 1958) was a German criminologist and lawyer, most noted for his advocacy of fingerprinting.

There he learnt to work with the reflective surface of silver and how it interacts with the space around it. Miller graduated (1986) in Fine Art from Falmouth School of Art. His graduation theses subject was the work of American artist Barbara Kruger. == Work == In 1994, after time spent living and working in Italy and Scotland, Miller returned to London. There he established a studio for projects for commercial and residential interiors. The studio made high specification sculptural objects, interiors and fittings. In 2002 he relocated to a remote part of Le Marche, central Italy. He continued to make functional sculptural objects and interior fittings and furniture. Alongside this work he created drawings, paintings and steel sculptures, some of which would later form the Nostalgia Futuro series, completed in 2016. In 2005, to coincide with an exhibition of his work at Macandi showroom in Mayfair, London, his work was featured in The World of Interiors. In 2009 Miller made the first Untitled Mirror for his home in Italy, using discarded mirrors he had found and picked up because he was drawn to the flaking silver. He then began working with a palette of handmade glass which he silvered to create mirror, often adding patina by creating marks on the silver itself with painterly lines and numbers. He became interested in creating a complexity of layers for the viewer, drawing attention to the surface of the mirror itself and creating distractions from their own reflection. Sixteen new works in shaded from inky midnight blue to pale celeste, The Sky Blue Series, were exhibited at Hedge Gallery in September 2012, including the first Untitled Tables I and 2. In this series Miller explored the thought of sky as a metaphor, likening the sky to the mind; dark and light, clear and hazy, intangible and mysterious. In 2012 Miller also exhibited works during Salone del Mobile Milan as guest artist at Gallery Space  Laboratorio Avallone, curated by Malgosia Szemberg. A large-scale mirror Rete Corallina 6X6/4 was presented at Design Miami/Basel 2015, now in a private collection. An exhibition of eleven new works, Tra L'Occhio e L'Ombra was presented at Gallery FUMI in April 2016, including Sguardo Cubetti series consisting of six functional sculptural objects each using the same form attached into different dimensions, creating tables and cupboards with secret sliding compartments. The exhibition included four works from Miller's very personal Nostalgia Futuro series where the reflection of his studio seen in the mirror panel of the work is painted onto the surrounding surface. Miller's latest body of work Sentiero dei Viandanti (Path of The Wayfarers) was a creative shift and marked his relocation from Italy to Catalonia, Spain. Pivoting around a large free-standing sculptural mirror work, Rifugio dei Viandanti (Sanctuary of The Wayfarers), the installation was designed to present the back of the work, where Miller's making and structuring was clearly visible like the clues on the back of a painting for the visitor to discover as they move around the gallery. == Personal == Sam Orlando Miller is married to photographer and filmmaker Helen Underwood Miller.

Male members of the family were able to transfer legal control of their daughters over to the state. One of the developments after the Civil War was the restoration of the Civil Code of 1889 by the Franco regime. This made women into virtual slaves to their husbands and fathers with men controlling not only the custody of their children, but their bank accounts, contracts, nationality and residency. Women did not reach the age of majority until 21, 25 if they were unmarried or not in a convent. Husbands and fathers could kill their wives and daughters for committing adultery or having sex outside marriage. Minor reforms were made in the 1950s and 1960s, largely as a result of economic pressures. Reforms around eliminating guardianship accelerated in the 1970s, before the death of Franco. They included the relinguishment of controls over nationality, children's custody and inheritance, while men no longer automatically became the default head of household. Reforms accelerated in the democratic transition period. The 1978 Spanish constitution gave men and women equality under the law, effectively ending the Franco's system of guardianship for single women. For married women, this system would remain in place after the end of the transition period. == Francoist period (1939 - 1975) == === 1930s Francoist Spain === The Civil Code of 1889 was restored by the Franco regime. This code saw the re-introduction of guardianship and subordination of women into civil law. It also saw the age of majority changed to 23, or 25 if they had not left their parents' home to marry or join a convent. Fuero del Trabajo of 1938 was the law which prevented married women from working in workshops or factories. The goal was to make women free to tend to their husband's needs inside their household. The rights of a husband over his wife were so strict that they amounted to a kind of slavery. The laws treated women as if they were permanent minors, in the custody of their husbands. It treated them as if they were insane or demented. Under the law, women were required to have the same nationality and residency as their husbands. Women had to submit to the authority of their husbands. Women did not have legal custody of their children as full custody belonged only to husbands. The only exception was if a woman was widowed, and remarrying would mean custody would be transferred to her new husband. Women could not sign contracts without the consent of their husbands. They could not open a bank account without their husband's consent. They had to leave work once they married. Women's marital assets were considered paraphernalia, which they could not manage or sell without their husband's consent. Women could not accept inheritances. === 1940s === Daughters had limited options to leave their father's households in the 1940s. They could only leave if one of their parents died and then remarried. Even then girls needed permission from a judge, and a place to live in the house of another relative. The Labor Regulation Act of 1942 said women had to sign a voluntary dismissal form within a month of being married that resulted in them losing their job. After that, newly married women had to wait two years before they could re-enter the workforce and only then, if they had permission from their husband. A 1943 law changed the age of majority for single women to 21. Despite turning 21, women could leave the home at that age unless their fathers gave permission; they would have to wait until they were 25. The only exception was if a woman married, or entered a convent. Under the Labor Contracts Act of 1944 women needed permission from their husband before they were able to sign an employment contract. In Barcelona during the 1940s, women had to be accompanied by men such as fathers, brothers or husbands if they wanted to be out on the street at night; they could not go out unaccompanied. This was a national policy that said women could not go out alone, and needed to be accompanied by a male family members. The 1944 Penal Code allowed for blood revenge, but only in cases where a husband caught his wife in the sexual act of committing adultery, not when a wife caught her husband. The law also stated under Article 438 that parents could kill their daughters if she was 22 years old or younger, and they caught her having sex with a man. Protests had taken place in the 1920s by women opposed to earlier versions of the law. Husbands and parents were still punished under the law for these killings, but the consequences were small and mostly included only a man being forced to leave his home and live at least 25 kilometers away for a few years. There was no punishment if the husband only seriously injured his wife. The code specified, \\"The husband who, if his wife is caught in adultery and he kills the woman or the adulterer on the spot or causes them one of the serious injuries, will be punished with banishment. If he causes them second-class injuries, he will be free of punishment. These rules are applicable to parents in the same circumstances, with respect to their daughters under twenty-three years of age and their corruptors, as long as they have been living in their father's house.\\" Teenage girls could become wards of the state through Patronato de Protección a la Mujer. Starting in 1941 and until 1985, girls were taken to centers run by nuns as part of the state's objective of rehabilitating the \\"fallen\\". Some of these girls were dropped off by parents who no longer wanted to care of them, as in the case of Raquel Castillo. Some girls were put into state custody because they were denounced by family members. Marian Torralbo was denounced by her brother, a member of Acción Católica, for partying. All were incapacitated without a trial. Women could not leave in many cases until they were 25-years-old, the age when they were legally adult women. Girls put into these reformatories were subject to virginity tests conducted by nuns. This was done on a daily basis, with girls forced to sit on a hospital bed where a doctor would ask them if they were a virgin. After they said yes, the doctor would imply they were liars and then put a stick up a girl's vagina to check without her consent. Many girls became hysterical during this process. Prostitutes were held at facilities run by nuns through Patronato de Protección a la Mujer from 1941 to 1985. They were always a minority, representing between 7 and 10% of the population. They would be put into cells next to girls abandoned by their families, spending only a few nights. According to Carlos Álvarez, researcher at the University of the Basque Country, \\"Their confinement fulfilled two objectives: on the one hand to separate them from the rest of society so that they did not influence it, and on the other hand to be 'rehabilitated', along the path of redemption.\\" === 1950s === The economic situation in the 1950s led to a revisiting of the Fuero del Trabajo. Spain was expanding its industrial activities and needed a workforce to support this. One of the easiest and cheapest ways to do that was to increase the number of women in the workforce. Economic needs of Spain were viewed as more important than ideological goals. Meaningful legal reforms for women were not covered under the Civil Code until the late 1950s and early 1960s. These changes were a result of pressure by women to bring the law more in line with cultural shifts in attitudes. One such amendment followed a newspaper article by Mercedes Formica about a man who stabbed his wife to death. The change in the 1889 Civil Code gave greater protections to married women. Other changes in law saw the home being redefined less as a husband's domain but rather a family domain. Married women were entitled to half a couple's common property, and husbands were required to obtain permission from their wives before selling the woman's half. When a widowed woman with children remarried, she was now allowed to keep custody of her children in the new marriage. Laws on guardianship in Spain were not reformed until 24 April 1958. One reform meant that women could retain custody of their children if they were widowed and remarried, but only if the deceased husband specified this in his will. Another reform of the 1958 law meant that for the first time a husband could not sell or alienate marital property without his wife's consent. These, and changes around the custody of children, came about as a result of a concordat with the Vatican. Mercedes Formica, a member of Falange, was one of the major supporters of the 1958 Civil Code reforms reducing the restrictions placed on married Spanish women. Formica was active in developing a feminist consciousness in Madrid in this period.Nielfa Cristóbal, Gloria. Movimientos femeninos, en Enciclopedia Madrid S.XX Article 57 continued to be problematic in 1958, as it specified husbands must protect their wives. It established authority of men over women, and was used by men to justify gender violence that caused grievous harm to their wives. It established marriage as a dictatorship. === 1960s === Up until the mid-1960s, Franco's legal system gave husbands near total control over their wives. This did not change until women started playing a more central role in the Spanish economy. The 1961 Law on Political Rights was supported by Sección Feminina. This amendment to the law gave women in the workforce additional rights, recognizing the importance of their work. The law saw single women being entitled to a salary similar to that of her male peers working in the same job. Pilar Primo de Rivera commented, \\"The law rather than being feminist is, on the contrary, supportive of what men can give to women as the emptier glass. Why else would we want the man's salary to be sufficiently remunerative so that women, especially married woman, would not have to work out of necessity! I assure you that if family life was sufficiently endowed, 90% of women would not work. For us, it is much more convenient and more desirable to have all the problems solved. But there are many families not just in Spain but around the world that cannot dispense with working women, precisely because it ensures there is enough for their children's care and education, the primary goal of marriage.\\" The law had one problem though in that married women still required permission from their husbands to accept a job. The blood revenge law was rescinded in 1963, with husbands and fathers no longer having the right to kill wives or daughters caught engaging in elicit sex acts. Many women and some men were in prison for adultery-related offenses. They were rarely talked about. Starting in 1975, before the death of Franco, women had started to mobilize by taking to the streets to demand the decriminalization of adultery. Single pregnant teenage girls could be particularly vulnerable during this period, with the state assuming guardianship of them and their children at the Peña Grande maternity prison, officially known as Nuestra Señora de La Almudena, until the girls were 25. In some cases, the state would line these pregnant women in a row, bring in men who had paid a fee and allow them to chose among the woman for one to marry or work in his home; the women would never know this beforehand. The men would sometimes return the women they had selected, indicating they were not happy with their choice and then pick out a new woman. It was primarily from the Peña Grande maternity prison that the stolen babies were taken, with women continuing to be imprisoned there until 1984. The conditions at the state facility were so bad that girls would commit suicide by jumping off the top stairwell. María Ángeles Martínez was one woman kept at the Peña Grande facility while pregnant. She remembered her experience, commenting: \\"I entered as a 19-year-old, in August of 1975. I was an orphan and I had just gotten pregnant, so my sister-in-law, who wanted to get rid of me, told me 'get dressed we're going', and without my knowing where we were going, she brought me here.\\" She described the nuns, \\"They told me what I was going to do with a daughter, how I was going to feed her, if they had thrown me out of the house, if I was a wretch, and she was going to be one too.\\" She described the process of giving birth, \\"I was in the dilatation room, and with half a head already out and they told me that I had to walk alone to the operating room and get on the gurney. I went with all the care, but she was born with a deformed skull. When they saw it, they stopped insisting I give her to them. I think that's why I did not lose my daughter.\\" === 1970-1975 === A reform in 1970 meant that women could prevent their husbands putting their children up for adoption without their consent. Law 31/1972 changed in respect to articles 320 and 321. It reduced the age of majority to 21 in all cases for women, and allowed women to act as an adult in civil life. This meant both men and women reached majority when they were 21. The law changed in 1972 to give women more freedom from their fathers. It allowed women 22 years old and older to leave the familial home without the consent of their parents. The Association of Women Lawyers was created in Madrid in 1971. They eventually played an important role in the Codification Commission for the reform of Family Law. The last major legal reform for women occurred in May 1975, when men were stripped of their automatic head of household status, women no longer being required by law to obey them or being forced to take their husbands' nationality. The amendment in Article 62 stated, \\"Marriage does not restrict the capacity of one of the spouses to act.\\" Article 63 removed the requirement that a wife obey her husband, and was amended to specify that both spouses had a mutual obligation to respect and protect each other. These changes meant women could accept inheritances, appear in court, and accept a job without the approval of their husbands. The changes also impacted who controlled matrimonial property. The law was also changed so that husbands were no longer married women's legal representatives by default. == Democratic transition period (1975 - 1985) == === 1975-1980 === Franco died in November 1975. His death brought about a slow process of reform over the next decade. One of the major revolutions of the 1978 Spanish constitution was that it gave men and women equality under the law. Cristina Almeida explained its importance stating, \\"What I knew and we all knew was that there were such obstacles that no matter how much the Constitution said that equality was decreed, it was not so easy to get it.\\" The advances for women in the constitution were largely a result of feminist women who continually took to the streets to demand equal rights. As women took no direct part in writing the new Spanish constitution, gender discrimination continued to exist within Spanish law. The 1978 Constitution still enshrined some discrimination against women, specifically against married women, as Article 57 of the Civil Code stated: \\"The husband must protect the wife, and she must obey the husband.\\" Despite many the changes brought about during the transition, there was no way of establishing the number of women who were killed by their partners or husbands before the 1990s. The abuse and murder of women in Spain by their partners was a form of sexist terrorism and claimed more victims than ETA. === 1980s === Law 11/1981 made men and women equal in marriage. It ended a system under which the husband was in charge of conjugal property.Vivas Larruy, A. (2004). \\"La discriminación por razón de sexo tras veinticinco años de la Constitución Española\\". Centro de Documentación Judicial. Cuadernos de Derecho Judicial. Madrid: CGP.Martínez Gallego, E. M. y Benito de los Mozos, A.I. (2000) “Mujer, ¿sujeto u objeto del derecho?”, en López de la Vieja M.T; Feminismo del pasado al presente. Primera Edición. Salamanca: Ediciones Universidad. Women could work without the consent of their husband, apply for a passport, open a bank account and get a drivers license. The new regulations were in line with United Nations guidelines. Children, on turning 18, now had a legal option to chose whether their father's or mother's surname came first. Law 30/1981 of 7 July also set a civil divorce process. If a family did not exercise an option to change the order of the names in their surname, the law defaulted to the father's surname as the first. The law changed in 1985 in regard to girls taken into state custody, as it no longer allowed minors to be placed under the control of the state for their own protection. Following this, all remaining efforts for reform were terminated. == References == Category:Women in Francoist Spain Category:Women in the Spanish transition to democracy ","title":"Guardianship in Francoist Spain and the democratic transition"},{"id":"60403755","text":"Les Hauts Talican is a commune in the Oise department in northern France.

She is known for her capture by the Cheyenne and Arapaho in 1860 or 1861, her protection and care for Arvilla and Josephine Meeker during their captivity, as well as her role within the politics of her tribe as a female leader alongside her sister-in-law, Chipeta. == Childhood and marriage == Shawsheen was born either on the Western Slope of Colorado, or in northern New Mexico and historians believe that she spent most of her childhood in the Uncompahgre Valley. Like many Young Ute girls, she would have learned the arts of bead work and weaving in order to trade with other Native Americans and settlers. Shawsheen was married to Chief Johnson 2, otherwise known as Canalla, a White River Ute. The marriage was arranged by her father, Guero in order to increase relations between the Northern Utes and the Tabeguache Utes. After the marriage, Shawsheen left the Uncompahgre Valley to live on the White River with her new family. == Capture by the Cheyenne and Arapaho == Sometime in 1860 or 1861, while out hunting near the Cache la Podure River on the Eastern Plains of Colorado, Shawsheen and members of her family encountered members of the Cheyenne and Arapaho tribe. During an altercation Shawsheen was taken captive. Her family alerted the United States Cavalry, but troops weren't able to locate her until two years later when soldiers from Camp Collins (now Fort Collins) found her. Historian Brandi Dennison describes the scene: \\"The cavalry successfully located the raiding party along the Cache la Podure River just as the Cheyenne bound Susan to an unlit pyre.\\" The troops rescued Shawsheen and she was sent to live with Simeon Whitley, a former agent of the Grand River Ute Agency, whom she stayed for a few months before returning home. During her stay with Whitley, she was able to learn to speak and understand English. Mrs. Collier, wife of Sergeant Collier, the man who led the soldiers that found Shawsheen, gave the name \\"Susan\\" to Shawsheen, a name many historians refer to her by today. There is some debate regarding Shawsheen's escape from captivity; many historians cite the story of her rescue from near sacrifice as correct, however the oral traditions of her descendants credit her with escaping on her own. During her time in captivity, she was treated as a slave instead of an adopted family member as in other North American Indian captivties. Her status within the tribe as a slave meant that she was forced into hard labor and menial tasks until her eventual escape. == Meeker Massacre == The Meeker Massacre was an attack on an Indian Agency by the Ute on September 29, 1879 in Meeker, Colorado. During the massacre, Nathan Meeker, an Indian Agent, along with his ten employees were killed, and his daughter Josephine and wife Arvilla Meeker were taken captive along with other women and children by the Ute. After the Massacre, the Ute met and discussed what to do with the captives. While many urged that the captives be killed or burned at the stake, Shawsheen, along with her husband, adamantly advocated for the release of the captives and their safety. Josephine Meeker said of her captivity, \\"We all owe our lives to the sister of Chief Ouray...\\" The captives praised Shawsheen for her kindness in not only advocating for their release, but doing her best in keeping them safe from harm for the duration of their captivity. The captive women even referred to her as \\"God Bless Susan\\" for her kindness. After the captives were released they immediately began to write about their experiences and many called for the recognition of Shawsheen for her actions. Jane Swisshelm asked that Shawsheen be given land in Colorado, despite the fact that the Ute's of western Colorado were being removed to Utah. Shawsheen has been hailed as a hero, by not only the Meeker women, but many others, for her actions within the Meeker Massacre and her protection of the captives. Josephine Meeker wrote about Shawsheen in her captivity narrative. She stated, \\"I may say more, which is that we all owe our lives to the sister of Chief Ouray.\\" Josephine describes how Shawsheen advocated for their release and ensured their safety. == Names == Shawsheen has been referred to by many names throughout her historical narrative. Her descendants refer to her as She-Towitch, while many modern historians refer to her as Susan, \\"Ute Susan\\" or Shawsheen. She has also been known as Tsashin, Shosheen, Shashein, and Shasheen in other newspaper or familial accounts. == Life and Legacy == Shawsheen's life and contributions to early Colorado history have been recognized by the Greeley Museums in Greeley, Colorado. This organization also preserves and interprets the Meeker Home Museum, the original home of the Meeker family. In Greeley, there is an elementary school named after her, (Shawsheen Elementary) as well as scholarship on her life and legacy on display at the Greeley Museum. == References == Category:1845 births Category:19th-century Native Americans Category:Ute people Category:Year of death unknown ","title":"Shawsheen"},{"id":"60403893","text":"Samlaya is a large village in Vadodara district in the Indian state of Gujarat. ==Demographics== India census, Samlaya had a population of 2,232.

Ignatius Xavier Pereira was born on 21 July 1888 in Tuticorin, India, the eldest son of Francis Xavier Pereira. His father moved the family to Colombo in 1889 establishing the company, F. X. Pereira and Sons, which specialised in drapery and tailoring. Pereira was educated at St. Benedict's College, Kotahena. After his father died in March 1906 Pereira took over the running of the family business at the age of eighteen. He expanded the operations of the company to include shipping, insurance, manufacturing and general stores. In 1924 Pereira was elected to the Legislative Council of Ceylon, winning the seat reserved for the Indian community by a substantial majority, defeating Mohamed Sultan. In 1930 he travelled to London and met with the Secretary of State for the Colonies, Sidney Webb, regarding minority representation in the proposed Donoughmore Constitution. He was subsequently appointed as the nominated member representing the Tamil Indian community on the 1st State Council of Ceylon on 26 June 1931. In 1934 the Viceroy of India, Marquess of Willingdon, conferred him with the title Dewan Bahadur, in recognition of his services to the Tamil community. Pereira was re-nominated to the 2nd State Council in 1936 and remained a member until the State Council was dissolved in 1947. He served on the Executive Committee for Labour, Industry and Commerce. During World War II Pereira was one of the few Ceylonese appointed to the War Council by the Commander-in-Chief Sir Geoffrey Layton in 1943. He also served as the Minister of Labour, Industry and Commerce when Sir Claude Corea left to take up a position as the Ceylonese Representative to the United Kingdom in 1946. In the same year Pope Pius XII invested him into the Papal Knighthood and made him the Knight Commander of the Order of Saint Sylvester, for his philanthropy and services to the church. Pereira was also a member of the Colombo Port Commission, the Board of Indian Immigrant Labour, the President of the Indian Mercantile Chamber, the Indian Club and the Vice President of the All Ceylon Tamil Congress. In 1948 he declined the offer by Prime Minister D. S. Senanayake of a position on the Senate of Ceylon due to his deteriorating health. He died on 21 July 1951, at the age of sixty-three. A stamp was issued in his honour coinciding with his 100th birthday anniversary in 1988 and subsequently a road was named after him in Pettah by the Colombo Municipal Council. == References == Category:1888 births Category:1951 deaths Category:All Ceylon Tamil Congress politicians Category:Alumni of St. Benedict's College, Colombo Category:Dewan Bahadurs Category:Indian Tamil businesspeople of Sri Lanka Category:Indian Tamil politicians of Sri Lanka Category:Knights of the Order of St. Sylvester Category:Members of the Legislative Council of Ceylon Category:Members of the 1st State Council of Ceylon Category:Members of the 2nd State Council of Ceylon Category:People from Thoothukudi Category:Sri Lankan people of Indian descent ","title":"I.

Although she was not very attractive and lacked charm, she perfected her technique with the result that she became a soloist as early as 1872. She is remembered in particular for her roles in August Bournonville's ballets, performing the title role in La Sylphide, Eliza and Victorine in Le Conservatoire and Céleste in Torreadoren. ==Biography== Born on 1 September 1853 in Bremen, Anna Regina Scholl was the daughter of the sculptor Philip Jean Josef Scholl (1805–1861) and the actress Theodora Jocunda Dalhoff (1826–1892). When she was only five years old, she appeared on stage at the Odense Teater where her mother was employed. In 1861, she entered the Royal Danish Ballet School where she was taught by Georg Nicolai Brodersen (1819–1908). She also received private lessons from Bournonville at her home in Frederiksberg. On 11 October 1876, she married the Danish officer Valentin Emil Tychsen (1847–1914) in Odense. When she was 14, she was allowed to appear in Pas de Trois Cousines together with Betty Hennings who was to perform with her frequently. Her début was on her 15th birthday when she danced a Spanish seguidilla. She completed her education at the Paris Opera Ballet School. Tychsen had to fight hard for prominent roles as she did not exhibit the natural charisma of many of her colleagues. During her early training, Bournonville had commented that she would have to dance \\"twice as well as the others as she was really no beauty\\". She nevertheless progressed, succeeding in being assigned the role of Edvard, a naval cadet in Fjernt fra Danmark, in 1868. After becoming a soloist in 1872, she went on to perform in various roles in Bournonville's ballets. These included the title role in La Sylphide, Eliza and Victorine in Le Conservatoire and Céleste in Torreadoren. In 1887, she was a guest dancer at the Royal Swedish Opera.

The microtektites are concentrated in large numbers in the gill rakers of approximately 50% of the sturgeon and paddlefish fossils, and show that the fish were alive when the impact occurred. Tanis is the name given to a site of paleontological interest in southwestern North Dakota, United States. Tanis is part of the heavily-studied Hell Creek Formation, a group of rocks spanning four states in North America renowned for many significant fossil discoveries from the Upper Cretaceous and lower Paleocene. Tanis is an extraordinary and unique site because it appears to record the events from the first minutes until a few hours after the impact of the giant Chicxulub meteor in extreme detail. This impact, which struck the Gulf of Mexico about 66 million years ago, wiped out all non-avian dinosaurs and many other species (the so-called \\"K-Pg\\" or \\"K-T\\" extinction). The extinction event caused by this impact paved the way for the domination of the Earth by mammals, including human beings. The site was originally discovered in 2008 by University of North Georgia Professor Steve Nicklas and field paleontologist Rob Sula. Their team successfully removed fossil field jackets that contained articulated sturgeons, paddlefish, and bowfins. These fossils were delivered for research to the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago. Recognizing the unique nature of the site, Nicklas and Sula brought in Robert DePalma, a University of Kansas graduate student, to perform additional excavations. The site was systematically excavated by Robert DePalma over several years beginning in 2012, working in near-total secrecy. Key findings were presented in two conference papers in October 2017. The full paper introducing Tanis was widely covered in worldwide media on 29 March 2019, in advance of its official publication three days later. The co-authors included Walter Alvarez and Jan Smit, both renowned experts on the K-Pg impact and extinction. Other papers describing the site and its fossils are in progress. At Tanis, unlike any other known Lagerstätte site, it appears freak circumstances allowed for the preservation of exquisite, moment-by-moment details caused by the impact event. These include many rare and unique finds, which allow unprecedented examination of the direct effects of the impact on plants and animals alive at the time of the large bolide impact some 3000 km distant. The events at Tanis occurred far too soon after impact to be caused by the megatsunamis expected from any large impact near large bodies of water. Instead, much faster seismic waves from the massive earthquakes probably reached the Hell Creek area as soon as ten minutes after the impact, creating seiche waves between high in the Western Interior Seaway and perhaps in other waters nearer Tanis, which was near an ancient river. These waves carried sea, land, freshwater animals and plants, and other debris several miles inland. The seiche waves exposed and covered the site twice, as millions of tiny droplets and debris from the impact were arriving on ballistic trajectories from their source in what is now the Yucatán Peninsula. As of April 2019, reported findings include: * animals and plant material preserved in three-dimensional detail and at times upright, rather than pressed flat as usual, their remains thrown together by the massive wave movements * articulated and cartilaginous salt and freshwater fish and marine reptiles found together miles inland, with many microtektites (molten debris particles from the impact) embedded in their gills as they tried to breathe * millions of \\"near perfect\\" primary (that is, not reworked) microtektites \\"almost indistinguishable\\" in chemical composition from previously-reported Chicxulub tektites found buried contemporaneous to the fossils in their own impact holes in the soft riverbed mud, and also preserved in amber on tree-trunks * large primitive feathers 30–40 cm long with 3.5mm quills believed to come from large dinosaurs * broken remains from almost all known Hell Creek dinosaur groups and some incredibly rare finds, such as: * fossils of hatchlings and intact eggs with embryo fossils * fossil pterosaurs for which no other fossils exist at that time * drowned ant nests with ants inside and chambers filled with meteor debris, and * tiny inhabited burrows from some of the first mammals in the area after the impact The hundreds of fish remains are distributed by size, and generally show evidence of tetany (a body posture related to suffocation in fish), suggesting strongly that they were all killed indiscriminately by a common suffocating cause that affected the entire population. Fragile remains spanning the layers of debris show that the site was laid down in a single event over a short timespan. A Triceratops or other ceratopsian ilium (hip bone) was found at the high water mark, in circumstances hinting that the dinosaur might speculatively have been a floating carcass and possibly alive at or just before impact, but the paper describing such remains is still in progressTweet by Kate Wong, 3 April 2019: I can’t wait to see papers describing the fossils, including the dinosaurs—which members of the Tanis team have said are in the works – the initial papers only include a photograph and its location within Tanis. The exceptional nature of the findings and conclusions have led some scientists to await further scrutiny by the scientific community before agreeing that the discoveries at Tanis have been correctly understood.Astonishment, skepticism greet fossils claimed to record dinosaur-killing asteroid impact – Science magazine, 2019-04-01 The site continues to be explored. ==Background== ===The K-Pg extinction event=== { class= style=\\"float:right\\" -   -  colspan=\\"2\\"   Location of Tanis and of the Chicxulub crater Left: present day, Right: at impact 65 million years ago } K-Pg boundary sample from Wyoming. The intermediate claystone layer contains 1000 times more iridium than the upper and lower layers (San Diego Natural History Museum). The Cretaceous–Paleogene (\\"K-Pg\\" or \\"K-T\\") extinction event around 66 million years ago wiped out all non-avian dinosaurs and many other species. Proposed by Luis and Walter Alvarez, the theory is now widely accepted that the extinction was caused by a huge meteorite or bolide that impacted Earth in the shallow seas of the Gulf of Mexico, leaving behind the Chicxulub crater. The impactor tore through the earth's crust, creating huge earthquakes, giant waves, and a crater 180 kilometers (112 mi) wide, and blasted aloft trillions of tons of dust, debris, and climate-changing sulfates from the gypsum seabed, and it may have created firestorms worldwide. With the exception of some ectothermic species such as the leatherback sea turtle and crocodiles, no tetrapods weighing more than survived. It marked the end of the Cretaceous period and the Mesozoic Era, opening the Cenozoic Era that continues today. However, because it is rare in any case for animals and plants to be fossilized, the fossil record leaves some major questions unanswered. One of these is whether dinosaurs were already declining at the time of the event due to ongoing volcanic climate change. Also, there was little evidence on the detailed effects of the event on Earth and its biosphere. No fossil beds were yet known that could clearly show the details that might resolve these questions. There is considerable detail for times greater than hundreds of thousands of years either side of the event, and for certain kinds of change on either side of the K-Pg boundary layer. But relatively little fossil evidence is available from times nearer the crucial event, a difficulty known as the \\"Three metre problem\\". ===Hell Creek Formation=== The Hell Creek Formation is a well-known and much-studied fossil-bearing formation (geological region) of mostly Upper Cretaceous and some lower Paleocene rock, that stretches across portions of Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Wyoming in North America. The formation is named for early studies at Hell Creek, located near Jordan, Montana, and it was designated as a National Natural Landmark in 1966. The formation contains a series of fresh and brackish-water clays, mudstones, and sandstones deposited during the Maastrichtian and Danian (respectively, the end of the Cretaceous and the beginning of the Paleogene periods) by fluvial activity in fluctuating river channels and deltas and very occasional peaty swamp deposits along the low- lying eastern continental margin fronting the late Cretaceous Western Interior Seaway. The iridium-enriched Cretaceous–Paleogene boundary, which separates the Cretaceous from the Cenozoic, is distinctly visible as a discontinuous thin marker above and occasionally within the formation. Numerous famous fossils of plants and animals, including many types of dinosaur fossils, have been discovered there. At the time of the Chicxulub impact, the present-day North American continent was still forming. Most of central North America had recently been a large shallow seaway, called the Western Interior Seaway (also known as the North American Sea or the Western Interior Sea), and parts were still submerged. This had initially been a seaway between separate continents, but it had narrowed in the late Cretaceous to become, in effect, a large inland extension to the Gulf of Mexico. The Hell Creek Formation was at this time very low-lying or partly submerged land at the northern end of the seaway, and the Chicxulub impact occurred in the shallow seas at the southern end, approximately from the site. Although Tanis and Chicxulub were connected by the remaining Interior Seaway, the massive water waves from the impact area were probably not responsible for the deposits at Tanis. Any water-borne waves would have arrived between later,Supplementary data and detailed findings – PNAS long after the microtektites had already fallen fell back to earth, and far too late to leave the geological record found at the site. It is not even clear whether the massive waves were able to traverse the entire Interior Seaway. Instead, the initial papers on Tanis conclude that much faster earthquake waves, the primary waves travelling through rock at about , probably reached Hell Creek within six minutes, and quickly caused massive water surges known as seiches in the shallow waters close to Tanis. Seiche waves often occur shortly after significant earthquakes, even thousands of miles away, and can be sudden and violent. Some recent examples include the 1964 Alaskan earthquake (seiches in Puerto Rico), the 1950 Assam-Tibet earthquake (India/China) (seiches in England and Norway), the 2010 Chile earthquake (seiches in Louisiana). Notably, the powerful Tōhoku earthquake in 2011, slower secondary waves traveled over in less than 30 minutes to cause seiches around high in Norway.Fjorden svinga av skjelvet Retrieved on 2011-03-17. The Chicxulub impact is believed to have triggered earthquakes estimated at magnitude , releasing up to 4000 times the energy of the Tohoku quake.If two earthquakes have moment magnitudes M1 and M2, then the energy released by the second earthquake is about 101.5 x (M2 – M1) times as much at the first. (Formula and details) The 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami was estimated at magnitude 9.1, so the energy released by the Chicxulub earthquakes, estimated at up to magnitude 11.5, may have been up to 101.5 x (11.5 – 9.1) = 3981 times larger. The 1960 Valdivia Chile earthquake was the most powerful ever recorded, estimated at magnitude 9.4 to 9.6. Using the same formula, the Chicxulub earthquakes may have released up to 1412 times as much energy as the Chile event. Co-author Mark Richards, a professor of earth sciences focusing on dynamic earth crust processes suggests that the resulting seiche waves would have been approximately high in the Western Interior Seaway near Tanis and credibly, could have created the high water movements evidenced inland at the site; the time taken by the seismic waves to reach the region and cause earthquakes almost exactly matched the flight time of the microtektites found at the site. This would resolve conflicting evidence that huge water movements had occurred in the Hell Creek region near Tanis much less than an hour after impact, although the first megatsunamis from the impact zone could not have arrived at the site for almost a full day. ===Robert DePalma=== Robert DePalma is a lifelong paleontologist with an M.A. in geology, the curator of vertebrate paleontology at the Palm Beach Museum of Natural History, and a doctoral student in paleontology at the University of Kansas.The Day the Dinosaurs Died – The New Yorker, 8 April 2019 He has published several discoveries, including a 2010 paper presenting the first known amber-trapped insect fossils from Hell Creek,Preliminary Notes on the First Recorded Amber Insects from the Hell Creek Formation – Journal of Paleontological Sciences JPS. C.10.0001 and a 2013 paper presenting a tyrannosaur tooth embedded in a hadrosaur tail, showing that tyrannosaurs were indeed hunters rather than pure scavengers – a controversy at the time. On the other hand, a published paper was criticized in 2015 and corrected in 2016, after other scientists noticed that in his reconstruction of a new species he called Dakotaraptor, he had accidentally included turtle entoplastron (armour) fragments in error, taking them to be part of the fossilized furculum. – publication date Feb 9 2016 As a result, some paleontologists felt that he might be prone to \\"over-interpret\\". Co- author Professor Phillip Manning, a specialist in fossil soft tissues, described DePalma's working techniques at Tanis as \\"meticulous\\" and \\"borderline archaeological in his excavation approach\\". His work with the 2013 tyrannosaur-hadrosaur specimen was similarly characterized as \\"meticulous\\" and \\"archeological\\" by the vertebrate paleontology department of the University of Kansas on its website. In 2004, DePalma was studying a small site in the well- known Hell Creek Formation, containing numerous layers of thin sediment, creating a geological record of great detail. His advisor suggested seeking a similar site, closer to the K-Pg boundary layer. The original discoverers of the site (Rob Sula and Steve Nicklas), who worked the site for several years, recognized its scientific importance and offered it to Depalma as he had some previous experience with working on fish sites. The site lacked the fine sediment layers he was initially looking for. Instead, the layers had never fully solidified, the fossils at the site were fragile, and everything appeared to have been laid down in a single large flood. == Discovery and exploration of 'Tanis' == prograding point bar of a river meander (bend). (3) Densest accumulations of fossil carcasses. (4) K-Pg boundary tonstein which directly overlays the impact deposit, and (5) directly overlays the adjacent river overbank. (6) location of Brooke Butte, the closest K-Pg outcrop to Tanis. Inset: Tanis at time of impact. The site is some miles from a large inland sea connected to the Gulf of Mexico. From DePalma et al. 2019 DePalma began excavating systematically in 2012 and quickly found the site to contain very unusual and promising features. Everything he found had been covered so quickly that details were exceptionally well preserved, and the fossils as a whole formed a very unusual collection – fish fins and complete fish, tree trunks with amber, fossils in upright rather than squashed flat positions, hundreds or thousands of cartilaginous fully articulated freshwater paddlefish, sturgeon and even saltwater mosasaurs which had ended up on the same mudbank miles inland (only about four fossilized fish were previously known from the entire Hell Creek formation), fragile body parts such as complete and intact tails, ripped from the seafish's bodies and preserved inland in a manner that suggested they were covered almost immediately after death, and – everywhere –millions of tiny spheres of glassy material known as microtektites, the result of tiny splatters of molten material reaching the ground. The microtektites were present and concentrated in the gills of about 50% of the fossilized fish, in amber, and buried in the small pits in the mud which they had made when they contemporaneously impacted. The fish were not bottom feeders. They had breathed in early debris that fell into water, in the seconds or minutes before death. The sediment appeared to have liquefied and covered the deposited biota, then quickly solidified, preserving much of the contents in three dimensions. Later discoveries included large primitive feathers 30–40 cm long with 3.5 mm quills believed to come from large dinosaurs; broken remains from almost all known Hell Creek dinosaur groups, including some incredibly rare hatchling and intact egg with embryo fossils; fossil pterosaurs for which no other fossils exist at that time; drowned ant nests with ants inside and chambers filled with meteor debris; and burrows of small mammals living at the site immediately after the impact. Analysis of early samples showed that the microtektites at Tanis were almost identical to those found at the Mexican impact site, and were likely to be primary deposits (directly from the impact) and not reworked (moved from their original location by later geological processes). DePalma quickly began to suspect that he had stumbled upon a monumentally important and unique site – not just \\"near\\" the K-Pg boundary, but a unique killing field that precisely captured the first minutes and hours after impact, when the K-Pg boundary was created, along with an unprecedented fossil record of creatures and plants that died on that day, as well as material directly from the impact itself, in circumstances that allowed exceptional preservation. By 2013, he was still studying the site, which he named 'Tanis' after the ancient Egyptian city of the same name, and had told only three close colleagues about it. Secrecy about Tanis was maintained until disclosed by DePalma and co-author Jan Smit in two short summary papers presented in October 2017, which remained the only public information before widespread media coverage of the full prepublication paper on 29 March 2019. == PNAS Paper published in 2019 == === Initial papers at GSA Conference, 2017 === Eighteen months before publication of the peer-reviewed PNAS paper in 2019 DePalma and his colleagues presented two conference papers on fossil finds at Tanis on 23 October 2017 at the annual meeting of the Geological Society of America. Jan Smit first presented a paper describing the Tanis site, its association with the K-Pg boundary event and associated fossil discoveries, including the presence of glass spherules from the Chicxulub impact clustered in the gill rakers of acipenciform fishes and also found in amber.Smit, J., et al. (2017) Tanis, a mixed marine-continental event deposit at the KPG Boundary in North Dakota caused by a seiche triggered by seismic waves of the Chicxulub Impact Paper No. 113-15, presented 23 October 2017 at the GSA Annual Meeting, Seattle, Washington, USA. DePalma then presented a paper describing excavation of a burrow created by a small mammal that had been made \\"immediately following the K-Pg impact\\" at Tanis.DePalma, R. et al. (2017) Life after impact: A remarkable mammal burrow from the Chicxulub aftermath in the Hell Creek Formation, North Dakota Paper No. 113-16, presented 23 October 2017 at the GSA Annual Meeting, Seattle, Washington, USA. ===Prepublication and authorship=== A paper documenting Tanis was released as a prepublication on 1 April 2019. Simultaneous media disclosure had been intended via the New Yorker, but the newspaper learned that a rival newspaper had heard about the story, and asked permission to publish early to avoid being scooped by waiting until the paper was published. The discovery received widespread media coverage from 29 March 2019. DePalma's co-authors include luminaries such as Jan Smit (retired paleontologist and world authorityhttps://www.washington.edu/news/2019/03/29/north-dakota-site-shows- wreckage-from-same-object-that-killed-the-dinosaurs – \\"Jan Smit ... who is considered the world expert on tektites from the impact, analyzed and dated the tektites from the Tanis site.\\"https://web.archive.org/web/20150207173038/http://www.dinosaurus.net/portret/smit.htm : Smit, die is verbonden aan de Vrije universiteit van Amsterdam, wordt door Alvarez omschreven als een K-T expert. \\"Jan heeft meer K-T vindplaatsen over de gehele wereld bestudeerd dan alle anderen.

A wide range of other people are credited with analysis, specific studies, and other contributions. As of April 2019, several other papers are in preparation, with further papers anticipated by DePalma and co-authors, and some by visiting researchers.– Robert DePalma voice interview with Jason Spiess on the 'Crude Life Content Network' channel, YouTube, at time 10m 40s.

His older brother, John Matsudaira, was a member of the Northwest School of artists. He was interned with his family at Puyallup Assembly Center and then at Minidoka War Relocation Center during World War II. After returning to Seattle in 1945, he attended Immaculate Conception Elementary School and then O'Dea High School before serving in the United States Air Force as a refuelling specialist on tanker aircraft from 1955 to 1960. After receiving an honorable discharge, he attended the University of Washington, where he received a bachelor's degree in economics in 1965, and then Seattle University, where he obtained a master's degree in public administration in 1977. Matsudaira then worked at Boeing as an industrial engineer and manager for several years before taking his position as executive director of the Governor's Asian American Advisory Council in 1972. Matsudaira opened Mich's Men's Shop on Jackson Street in Seattle's International District in 1976. He moved his business to Belltown and then to Pioneer Square before closing his shop in 1990. He then returned to Boeing as a financial analyst. He was recognized for his 20 years of experience with Boeing in 2002. He retired from the company on March 1, 2003. In 1972, Matsudaira, along with other Asian American activists, established the Governor's Asian American Advisory Council, which he headed as executive director. In 1973, he was appointed to a committee reviewing the affirmative action plan on employment opportunities of minority residents by Governor Daniel J. Evans. On May 13, 1974, after the council was renamed the Commission on Asian American Affairs, Matsudaira was one of the speakers at an Asian American awareness workshop hosted by Evergreen State College. On February 19, 1976, he was present in the Cabinet Room when President Gerald Ford signed a proclamation nullifying Executive Order 9066. He resigned his position on the council in 1978 in protest against Governor Dixy Lee Ray. He was a member of the Seattle chapter of the Japanese American Citizens League, and served as its president in 1979. During his tenure, when several Japanese residents of Idaho opposed the plans by the Seattle JACL to construct a replica guard tower in Minidoka and burn it on October 13, Matsudaira claimed that the members of the Idaho JACL chapter are \\"not the custodians of history of Minidoka.\\" Due to opposition, the Seattle chapter did not attend the dedication deremony on August 18 and the plan was later abandoned. Matsudaira later joined the National Council for Japanese American Redress, which he supported financially.

The film stars Dylan O'Brien, Michael Rooker, Ariana Greenblatt and Jessica Henwick. It was released by Paramount Pictures via video on demand and in select theaters on October 16, 2020. == Plot == After humanity nukes an asteroid headed for Earth, radiation spills down upon the planet, mutating all cold blooded animals into monsters. During the evacuation of Fairfield, Joel Dawson (Dylan O'Brien) is separated from his girlfriend Aimee (Jessica Henwick), but promises he'll find her. Seven later, Joel has survived and is living in an underground bunker, as part of a colony. While others go on supply runs Joel is left to the kitchen, as he freezes-up in dangerous situations. Joel makes radio contact with Aimee, learning of her colony and sharing stories of survival. When an ant-monster breaches his colony and another person is killed, Joel sets off on a quest to see Aimee, armed with a crossbow and a dead radio. Passing through the suburbs Joel is attacked by a giant frog, but is saved by a strange dog. Joel follows it to an old bus, and learns the dog's name is Boy, and his owner is gone. Boy follows Joel on his journey, and helps warn him of various dangers. Joel falls into a nest of worm-monsters, but Clyde Dutton (Michael Rooker) and Minnow (Ariana Greenblatt), rescue him from the \\"Sand-Gobblers\\" and scold him for his lack of survival skills. They are heading north to the mountains, where the cold weather and the elevation means less monsters. They teach Joel some basic survival skills. Clyde teaches Joel that not all monsters will attack, showing him a Boulder Snail and saying that you can always tell in their eyes. After further travel they part ways, and Clyde gifts Joel a grenade. Joel and Boy continue west through a swamp until Boy senses another monster and hides. A giant centipede-monster crawls up from underground, trapping Boy. Joel freezes, but eventually shoots the centipede with the crossbow and saves Boy. To escape the rain they hide in an abandoned house, where a robot named Mav1s (Melanie Zanetti) powers up and greets him. Mav1s is able to show Joel a photos of his parents. Mav1s also powers his radio long enough for him contact Aimee and learn she is close. Aimee tells Joel that new survivors have reached their colony and are going to take them away to safety. Joel loses contact, and Mav1s' battery dies while she is playing Joel some music. In the morning Joel and Boy are attacked by a Queen Sand-Gobbler. They hide but Boy makes noise, giving away their position. Joel kills the Queen with the grenade, but yells at Boy for what he did, and Boy runs off. After swimming across the river Joel is covered in leeches, which poison him and cause hallucinations, but he is rescued before he passes out. Joel wakes up in Aimee's colony, where she is the leader and most of the colonists are elderly and dependent on her. Joel is introduced to the new survivors, Cap (Dan Ewing) and his crew. Cap has offered to take the colony to on their yacht to a safer place. Everyone is packing up and having a farewell party. Joel decides to return to his colony and contacts them on the radio, they are pleased and excited by his survival, but their colony has become unsafe and they will have to leave soon. Cap sends Joel berries, which he recognizes as poisonous. Realizing Cap was lying to them, he rushes to warn Aimee, but he is knocked unconscious. They all awake tied-up on the beach. Cap reveals his group are food thieves. The yacht is not powered, but rather pulled by a large crab-monster that Cap controls with an electrified chain. Cap calls the crab to feed on the colonists. Instead of killing the crab Joel looks into its eyes and shooting the chain, Joel frees the crab from Cap's control, and it takes down their yacht and devours Cap and his team. Boy returns to Joel, and with Aimee's colony saved, Joel decides to head back to his colony and informs her of the safety in the mountains. They share a goodbye kiss, reigniting Aimee's love for Joel, and she tells him she'll find him. Joel treks back 85-miles and finds his friends are still alive. They pack up and head north to find Clyde and Minnow. Joel broadcasts his story on the radio, inspiring other colonies to take to the surface, and Aimee's colony begins moving north to meet Joel. As everyone heads north, Clyde and Minnow, alive and well on the mountaintop, wonder if Joel will survive the next journey. == Cast == * Dylan O'Brien as Joel Dawson * Michael Rooker as Clyde Dutton, a survival expert * Ariana Greenblatt as Minnow * Jessica Henwick as Aimee, Joel's girlfriend from before the apocalypse * Melanie Zanetti as Mav1s * Dan Ewing as Cap * Donnie Baxter as Parker * Ellen Hollman as Dana * Senie Priti as Karen == Production == In June 2012, it was announced that Paramount Pictures was developing the film Monster Problems, with Shawn Levy producing, based on a spec script by Brian Duffield.

He has published novels, poems, essays and audiobooks, as well as poetry translated from English, French and Bulgarian (including John F. Deane, Blaga Dimitrova and Lyubomir Nikolov). == Early life == Basse grew up in North Rhine- Westphalia, Lower Saxony and Baden-Württemberg. He earned his university- entrance diploma in 1976 at the Evangelical Seminaries of Maulbronn and Blaubeuren. Between 1977 and 1979, Basse worked as a trainee in the editorial department of Schwäbische Zeitung. Thereafter he worked at Süddeutscher Rundfunk (SDR) in Stuttgart. In 1984 he moved to Munich and began studying philosophy at the LMU, where he graduated in 1990 with a master's degree. In 1984, Basse was one of the co-founders of the Munich Office of Literature and was part of the board of directors for four years. In the 90s and 2000, Basse introduced numerous authors in the Poetry Cabinet Munich, among them Anise Koltz and Jean Portante, Eva Hesse and Mary de Rachewiltz, daughter and editor of the works of Ezra Pound. From 1993 to 2015, Basse worked as a freelancer in the Cultural Critics Department of Bayerischer Rundfunk. From 1994 to 1999 he contributed reviews to the literary supplement of Sueddeutsche Zeitung on a regular basis. Since 2015 he has focused on his work as a novelist. == Literary work == Basse’s first collection of poems, And in the morning there is still news (1992, 1994 2nd ed.) was well received and he was characterized as \\"a powerful lyric poet who looks at the particles of reality under the magnifying glass\\". Basse's early lyrics were strongly influenced by his former mentor, Johannes Poethen; In spite of this, it was observed that \\"he does not abandon rhythm and verse, but always remains in the realm of everyday life, facts\\". The second volume of poetry by Basse was described as \\"a kind of poetic cartography\\". In The Conquest Does Not Take Place (1997) he uses the form of poems in prose for the first time. Painting, dance and music are also repeatedly included in the poems. The reader of Basse’s Sea in Mind feels like the viewer of Caspar David Friedrich’s The Monk by the Sea: “As if his eyelids were ripped out.” In secondary literature, Basse’s second volume was also praised for its formal stylistic stringency: “Poems in prose without periods or commas.” His third collection of poems, Partisan Feelings (2004) was composed in a form Basse called lyrical protocols: Texts or speech acts completely synthesized that combine different levels of discourse and reality. After another volume of poems in prose (Splendid People, 2008), Basse returned in his fifth – and for now last – book of poems, Skype Connected (2010), to shorter poetic forms. Like in his lyrical protocols, he sticks closely to everyday spoken language. At the heart of this collection of love poems is, according to the internet portal Fixpoetry, \\"the mature love of two people (...) who, from time to time, question everything one could possibly question. \\"His love poems generate their intimacy - and emotional, as well as media- historic timeliness - out of the spiritual abyss of human alienness and territorial distance; healing moments come from Italy, which Basse - as a brother in spirit of Pasolini - envisions in a radical anti-idyllic way.\\"Pia- Elisabeth Leuschner: Lyrischer Reichtum der ‚Mittleren‘ Generation. In: Fromm, Waldemar, Knedlik, Manfred, Schellong, Marcel, (Hrsg.): Literaturgeschichte Münchens. Verlag Friedrich Pustet, Regensburg 2019, , S. 590 f. In 2010, Basse published his first novel, Career, in which he takes a critical look at the German left during the 80s and 90s. In 2016 he published his second novel, American Zone, which reflects the problematic German-American relationship.

The family was placed in a transit camp in Jerusalem, and later moved to the mostly-Moroccan Katamon neighborhood of Jerusalem. According to Dan Albo, who published a critical anthology of essays about Ben-Simhon, she was a bright student, and was identified as early as elementary school as having a gift for literature. Her father abandoned the family when Ben-Simhon was young. Her mother got married again, to an immigrant from Italy, and thus she was exposed to French (colonial), Moroccan, Italian, and Israeli culture. When Ben-Simhon began to attend an exclusive high school in a neighboring wealthy (i.e. Ashkenazi) area, she discovered for the first time the negative stigma held by the Israeli Ashkenazi mainstream regarding Mizrahim, and Moroccans in particular. Ben-Simhon did her mandatory military service in an intelligence unit of the army, and then worked for two years in the secret security services. In the course of her duties, she \\"witnessed things that disturbed her deeply, and caused her to resign.\\" Ben-Simhon studied Hebrew Literature at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, and acting at the Beit Zvi dramatic arts academy in Tel Aviv. Upon completing her studies, Ben-Simhon began working at an advertising agency, and as an editor for the local newspaper \\"Jerusalem\\". She also worked as a translator and editor for various institutions. Ben-Simhon started writing at age 25. She wrote short stories and poems, and also translated poems into Hebrew. Her first collection, Interested Not Interested, was published in 1983, and she published a total of four volumes of work. In addition, her poems have been included in anthologies, and some have been translated to English. Ben-Simhon had several episodes of mental illness, and was hospitalized in Talabia psychiatric hospital in Jerusalem. She was in a long-term relationship with novelist Shimon Zimmer. On July 24, 1996, Ben- Simhon was killed in a car crash. == Themes and topics in her work == Ben- Simhon's work deals with issues relating to gender, ethnicity, class, culture and politics. She writes about being a Mizrahi woman in Israel, and about being a Mizrahi poet in an Ashkenazi literary world. Her poetry has been called \\"sensitive and brutal, personal and political,\\" and also \\"fascinating, sharp and in particular, very intelligent.\\" She wrote about racial stigmas, about societal power relations, about growing up poor, and living in a society where you \\"cannot gain entrance by being good\\", because you do not have the correct identity profile. A great deal of her poetry dealt with significant relationships in her life: For example, her friendship and collegial relationship with Israeli poet Amira Hess, which spanned over 20 years, found its way into both women's books and poetry. Other poets whose work touched on hers in some way include that of her life-partner writer Shimon Zimmer, and poets Oded Peleg and Balfour Hakak. But it is widely accepted that a particularly significant person in her work is Israeli poet Meir Wieseltier. Much of her first collection, Interested Not Interested, deals with her relationship with him, though no one knows for certain whether there was ever a romantic or sexual connection between the two, or if what she wrote about was all fantasy. Her life-partner, Shimon Zimmer, has stated that there were incidents in which Ben-Simhon \\"occasionally, in times of crisis, would go to his house and try to force her presence on him. I think one time a window was broken, and he called the police.\\" Much of what she wrote was clearly a product of her imagination. It has been stated by mutual acquaintances of the two that Wieseltier treated Ben-Simhon in a very condescending and dismissive way, and according to researcher and poet Mati Shemoelof, it is far from coincidental that the best-known poem from her first collection dealing with Wieseltier is also a poem about the inferior status of a Mizrahi woman, and the stereotypical way Mizrahi women are sexualized, and not viewed as sources of knowledge or intelligence. Critic Eli Hirsch, however, dismisses Wieseltier's importance in her work and life: \\"Attempting to attribute to him a central role not only in her biography but also in the understanding of her poetry seems problematic to me. Wieseltier seems to mostly be a kind of hook on which the poet hung her yearning for a father. Much more significant is the influence of other women poets on the poetry of Ben-Simhon – Yona Wallach, and Hess, a friend of Ben-Simhon, who shared the heavy burden of Mizrahi women's poetry in those years.\\" == Film == In 2017, a documentary film about Ben- Simhon's life, Miriam's Song (Ahava Mitrageshet Lavo) was created by filmmakers Eldad Boganim and Israel Winkler, with screenwriter Dan Albo. The film includes a recording from 1988, which was discovered by chance, after her death, in which Ben-Simhon reads a love letter to the poet Meir Wieseltier. The letter, the heart of this film, offers a glimpse at Ben-Simhon's ruptured soul. == Works == * מעוניינת לא מעוניינת, הוצאת הקיבוץ המאוחד, תל אביב, 1983.

The name is borrowed from the Greek, and was therefore used by Jews throughout the Roman Empire, but not by Jews in Babylonia. Hence, the Babylonian Talmud – when mentioning the archisynagogue – finds it necessary to translate the word by parnas.Ketubot 8b; compare Yerushalmi Berachot 3:1, 6b ==Role== The distinctive function of the archisynagogue was to select suitable men for the reading of the Law, the reciting of prayers, and for preaching; since in ancient times the synagogue did not have regularly appointed officers for the performance of these duties. From the Jerusalem Talmud,Yerushalmi Berachot 3:1, 6b it further appears that in cases of necessity the archisynagogue of a community had to act as its reader. In consonance with the nature of his office, the archisynagogue was chosen for his piety and good moral character, while in the case of an archon the essential requirements were social position and influence. The Pharisees therefore regarded the archisynagogues as inferior only to the scholars ().Pesachim 49b.

This explains why the title \\"archisynagogue\\" was sometimes attached to the names of the wife and the children, as found on some Greek inscriptions.

J., Berthier, J., Brakke, K. A., Dostie, A. M., Theberge, A. B., & Berthier, E. (2018). Droplet Behavior in Open Biphasic Microfluidics. Langmuir, 34(18), 5358–5366. https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.langmuir.8b00380 The miniaturization of this process allows for improved sensitivity, high throughput, and ease of manipulation and integration, as well as dimensions that can be more physiologically relevant. The benefits of both open and closed microfluidic platforms have allowed the option for the combination of the two, where the device is open for the introduction and culturing of cells, and can be sealed prior to analysis. ==Design== Cells and proteins can be patterned in microfluidic devices with one of the channel walls exposed in different geometries and designs depending on the behaviors and interactions to be studied, such as quorum sensing or co-culturing of several types of cells. A majority of cell culturing has been carried out by introducing the cells in a perfused conditioned medium to simulate the desired cell populations in traditional close-channel microfluidic devices. The challenge to support the cell growth and simultaneously study multiple cell types in a single device with an exposed channel is that the interactions between cells in this medium needs to be controlled since the timing and location of the interactions is critical. This issue can be addressed in several ways including the modification of the device design, using droplet microfluidics, and cell sorting.Kaigala, G. V., Lovchik, R. D., & Delamarche, E. (2012). Microfluidics in the “open Space” for performing localized chemistry on biological interfaces. Angewandte Chemie - International Edition, 51(45), 11224–11240. https://doi.org/10.1002/anie.201201798 Not only does this allow for the ease of manipulating the environment of the cells, but having an open channel wall allows for a better understanding of biological interactions at this interface. Creating designs of microfluidic platforms with different compartments that are isolated and have different dimensions allows for co- culturing of several types of cells. These devices often incorporate droplet formation to encapsulate cells and act as transport and reaction vehicles in two or more immiscible phases, making it possible to carry out numerous parallel analyses using different conditions.Casavant, B. P., Berthier, E., Theberge, A. B., Berthier, J., Montanez-Sauri, S. I., Bischel, L. L., … Beebe, D. J. (2013). Suspended microfluidics. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 110(25), 10111–10116. https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1302566110 Open microfluidics has also been coupled with fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) to allow for cells to be contained in individually sorted compartments in an open microfluidic network for culturing in an exposed environment. The exposure of one of the channel walls introduces the issue of evaporation and therefore cell loss, however this issue can be minimized by using droplet microfluidics where the cell-containing droplets are submerged in a fluorinated oil. Although evaporation is a major disadvantage of using an open microfluidic system for cell culturing, the advantages over a closed system include ease of manipulation and access to the cells. For certain applications, such as the study of drug transport and lung function using alveolar epithelium cells, air exposure to is essential for developing the lungs. ==PDMS== Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) is a common material for open microfluidic devices that introduces additional advantages and disadvantages. The adsorption of small biological molecules from cell culturing samples as well as the release of oligomers into the culture medium have both been posed as issues of using PDMS for biological studies, however these can be reduced by adopting pretreatment procedures to create optimal environments. Advantages of using PDMS include the ease of surface modification, low cost, biocompatibility, and optical transparency.Halldorsson, S., Lucumi, E., Gómez- Sjöberg, R., & Fleming, R. M. T. (2015). Advantages and challenges of microfluidic cell culture in polydimethylsiloxane devices. Biosensors and Bioelectronics, 63, 218–231. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2014.07.029 In addition, PDMS is an attractive material to use for generating oxygen gradients for cell culturing in studies that involve monitoring ROS governed cellular pathways due to its oxygen permeability.Lo, J. F., Sinkala, E., & Eddington, D. T. (2010). Oxygen gradients for open well cellular cultures via microfluidic substrates. Lab on a Chip, 10(18), 2394–2401. https://doi.org/10.1039/c004660d Plastics such as polystyrene can be used to create microfluidic devices by embossing and bonding methods, CNC milling, injection molding, or stereolithography. Devices created with polystyrene by these methods include microfluidic platforms that integrate several microfluidic systems, creating arrays to study several cell cultures simultaneously. Another type of material that is used for open-microfluidic cell culturing is paper-based microfluidics. Cell culturing on paper-based microfluidic devices is accomplished either by encapsulating cells in a hydrogel or directly seeding them in stacked cellulose filter papers and the cell culture medium is passively transported to the culture areas.Tao, F. F., Xiao, X., Lei, K. F., & Lee, I. C. (2015). Paper-based cell culture microfluidic system. Biochip Journal, 9(2), 97–104. https://doi.org/10.1007/s13206-015-9202-7 A major advantage of this type of open-microfluidics includes the low cost, the variety of dimensions of porous papers that are commercially available, improved cell viability, adhesion, and migration over tissue culture plates.Ng, K., Gao, B., Yong, K. W., Li, Y., Shi, M., Zhao, X., … Xu, F. (2017). Paper-based cell culture platform and its emerging biomedical applications. Materials Today, 20(1), 32–44. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mattod.2016.07.001 In addition, it is an attractive substrate for 3D cell culture devices due to its ability to incorporate essential characteristics such as oxygen and nutrient gradients, fluid flow that can control cell migration, and stacking filter papers with different cells suspended in hydrogel to monitor cellular interactions or complex populations. == References == Category:Microfluidics Category:Cell culture ","title":"Cell culturing in open microfluidics"},{"id":"60405163","text":"Daniel Bochner (born September 5, 1984) is a Canadian professional ice hockey coach and a former player.
