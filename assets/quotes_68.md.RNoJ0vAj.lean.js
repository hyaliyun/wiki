During welding, joints are formed between two or more separate pieces of material. A welded joint subjected to cyclic loading could fail due to fatigue. Fatigue results from this cyclic loading, as well as strains, in the material. Throughout a welded assembly's life, cracks, which reduce the fatigue life of a joint, could initiate, propagate, and grow causing the assembly to fail even if these cyclic stresses are low and smaller than the base material and weld filler material yield stress. Hence, the fatigue strength of a welded joint does not correlate to the fatigue strength of the base material. Incorporating design considerations in the development phase can reduce failures due to fatigue in welded joints.  Stress Life Method  Typical S-N Curve Similar to high cycle fatigue analysis, the stress life method utilizing stress-cycle curves (also known as W√∂hler curves) can be used to determine the strength of a welded joint under fatigue loading. Welded sample specimens undergo repeated loading at a specified stress amplitude, or fatigue strength, until the material fails. This same test is then repeated with various stress amplitudes in order to determine its corresponding cycles, N, to failure. With the data collected, fatigue strength can be plotted against the corresponding number of cycles for a specific material, welded joint and loading. From these curves, the endurance limit, finite-life and infinite-life region can then be determined.  Factors Affecting Fatigue   Welding Residual Stresses  During the welding process, residual stresses can present themselves in the area of the weld, either in the heat affected zone or fusion zone . The mean stress a welded joint may see in application, can be altered due to the welding processes implementing residual stresses, changing the fatigue life and can render S-N laboratory testing results. Welded assemblies, with geometrical imperfections, can also introduce residual stresses. Removal of residual stresses by stress relief methods can only be partially achieved. Residual stresses can still remain in a welded joint even after some of these stress relief methods have been achieved.  Member Thickness  An increase in thickness of a base material decreases the fatigue strength when a crack propagates from the toe of a welded joint. This is due to an increase in residual stress concentrations in thick material cross sections.  Material Type  All materials have varying physical and mechanical properties. As a materials ultimate tensile strength increases, this does not lead to an increase in fatigue strength. This is not the case when evaluating materials that do not contain welded joints. Therefore, stress-cycle curves for welded joints cannot be correlated to the materials ultimate tensile strength. Most design information has been developed for structural steels.  Welding Process  Many welding processes are available for various applications and environments. Stress-cycle curves are not available for all of these processes and still need to be developed so that proper fatigue analysis can be performed. The most abundant process found in stress-cycle curves is developed from specimens prepared by arc welding.  Surrounding Environment  The surrounding environment can effect the fatigue life of a welded assembly, often lowering it. Points such as temperature, moisture, and geographical location are considered part of the surrounding environment. Environments which contain sea water may see decreased fatigue life due to the increase in crack growth rates. Little information is available in this area, but it is known that if a base material is subjected to corrosion, the fatigue strength can decrease to what is similarly found in welded joints.  Avoiding Fatigue Failures of a Welded Joint  Since the presence of cracks reduces fatigue life and accelerates failure, it is important to avoid all cracking mechanisms in order to prolong the fatigue life of a welded joint. Other weld defects, such as inclusions and lack of penetration, should also be avoided due to these defects being the source of where cracks can initiate. Detailed review of the welded joint during the design is another way to reduce failures. Ensuring that the design is able to handle the cyclic loading profile will prevent premature failures. Additional resources through design handbooks are also available to aid in designing the welded joint to optimize fatigue life. Finite element analysis can also be used to successfully predict fatigue failure.

It is a method for the synthesis of a peptide from Œ±-amino acid-N-carboxylic acid anhydrides (NCAs) and amino acids or peptide esters.J. Leggett Bailey: A new Peptide Synthesis. In: Nature.

The residues R1 and R2 can be organic groups or hydrogen atoms, R3 is the used amino acid or peptide ester: √úbersichtsreaktion der Bailey-Peptid- Synthese  Reaction mechanism  The reaction mechanism is not known in detail. Supposedly, the reaction begins with a nucleophilic attack of the amino group on the carbonyl carbon of the anhydride group of the N-carboxylic acid anhydride (1). After an intramolecular proton migration, a 1,4-proton shift and the cleavage of carbon dioxide follows, resulting in the peptide bond in the final product (2): √úbersichtsreaktion der Bailey-Peptid-Synthese  Atom economy  The advantage in atom economy of using NCAs for peptide formation is that there is no need for a protecting group on the functional group reacted with the amino acid.Ryoichi Katakai: Peptide Synthesis Using o-Nitrophenylsulfenyl N-Carboxy Œ±-Amino Acid Anhydrides.

For example, the Merrifield synthesis depends on the use of Boc and Bzl protecting groups, which need be removed after the reaction. In the case of Bailey peptide synthesis, the free peptide is directly obtained after the reaction. However, unwanted and difficult to remove by-products may be formed. An N-substitution of the NCA (for example, by an o-nitrophenylsulfenyl group) can simplify the subsequent purification process, but on the other hand deteriorates the atom economy of the reaction.

The school has been in existence for over 140 years following the education act of 1870. Their motto is \\"The little school with a big personality\\". History Sandford Hall, home of the school from 1950 St Wilfrid's was founded by The Reverend John Gilberd Pearse, Rector of All Hallows-on-the-Wall Church, in 1870 following the introduction of the Elementary Education Act making education compulsory for all children. Initially named the 'Forty School' due to having forty spaces, the school was attended by many children attending school for the first time. In 1890 the school moved into rooms at the Mint Methodist Church because it needed larger premises, and numbers quickly doubled. In 1950 the orphanage run by the Sisters of St Wilfrid's on St David's Hill closed. Having outgrown the space at the Mint, the Junior School moved into Sandford Hall and the Senior school moved into the old orphanage, its present location. Until 1967 St Wilfrid's was primarily a girls‚Äô school although some boys were admitted in the lower years. However, in 1967, following the closure of Mount Radford School, the decision was made for St Wilfrid's school to become fully co- educational and so it became the first independent co-educational school in Exeter. During the 70's and 80's, St Wilfrid's pupils were well known for taking food parcels to elderly residents of local almshouses and singing Christmas Carols in the High Street. For many years traffic was stopped as pupils processed to Exeter Cathedral for an annual St Wilfrid's Day service every October. Up until 1988 the school had been taught entirely by nuns, however, with increasing curriculum demands it was decided they were no longer able to fully run the school and so the Senior department became a separate school with its own head-teacher and financial control. The Junior department continued under the Sisters‚Äô leadership for a while longer until by 1994 there were only two remaining Sisters: Sister Elsie (who died in 1997) and Reverend Mother Lillian (who died in 2004 at the age of 107) at which point the juniors rejoined the seniors and moved into the current site on St David's Hill. Today the school still has senior and junior classes, and also runs a Montessori pre-prep within the grounds of the school. The current proprietor, Mrs Alexandra Macdonald-Dent, stepped down as headmistress in 2017, to be replaced by the current headmaster, Mr Bovingdon. Academic environment As standards of education were not so high in late Victorian times, the early curriculum was limited by the abilities of the Sisters teaching there. As standards improved and more subjects were introduced, the Sisters became trained as professional teachers and were joined by specialist teachers to cover the more demanding subjects. By the 1930s Science, Mathematics, History, R.E., Geography and Sports along with the original \\"three Rs\\" formed the school syllabus, and older pupils began to take external examinations. Today the school offers a wide range of academic subjects including separate sciences from year 7, and numerous extra-curricular activities including sports and creative arts. 'SWOP', St Wilfrid's Outdoor Pursuits, provides opportunities for the students to go on walks and outdoor activities with the school, and take part in externally arranged challenges such as the Sidmouth Saunter. Students also take part in the Duke of Edinburgh Award Scheme or the Ten Tors weekend on Dartmoor. Academic standards The school was inspected by Ofsted in October 2017; their report evaluated the school as being 'Good' in all areas (Overall Effectiveness; Effectiveness of leadership and Management; Quality of Teaching; Learning and Assessment; Personal Development, Behaviour and Welfare; Outcomes for pupils; Early Years provision). The report concluded that \\"Leaders have created a school community where relationships between staff and pupils are deeply rooted in mutual respect\\", and \\"pupils make strong progress from their different starting points. A large proportion of pupils arrive working below age-related expectations but they quickly start to catch up.\\" At Key Stage 1/2, pupils study Maths, English, French, Science, History, Geography, Drama, Music, Art, Home Economics, RE, PE, Games, ICT and PSME/Citizenship. Key Stage 3 follows a similar pattern with the addition of Italian. For Key Stage 4, the key subjects are English Language/Literature, Maths, French and/or German and Science. Choices include Media Studies, Geography, History, Art and PE.

Rising north of Caltowie in the Hundred of Caltowie, the Yackamoorundie Creek, a tributary of the Rocky River, flows briefly through the hundred near Gulnare, at which point it makes a significant change from flowing southwards to flowing westwards. Plan of the Hundred of Yackamoorundie in 1962 The indigenous place name yackamoorundie or jakaramurundi is officially thought to mean \\"sister to the big river\\", the Yackamoorundie Creek flowing from this point on a roughly parallel course to the bigger River Broughton, which passes east to west through the centre of the hundred and ultimately receives the Yackamoorundie Creek flows.

History The hundred was proclaimed on 18 February 1869 by Governor James Fergusson. In 1888 the hundred was annexed by the District Council of Georgetown, bringing local government to the hundred. In 1988 the Georgetown council became part of the new District Council of Rocky River by amalgamation with neighbouring councils.

It was located in the southwest outside the Puzhou ancient city, and near to the Pujin Ferry (). The Stork Tower had reached unprecedented heyday in the Tang dynasty (618-907) due to an eternally famous poem \\"On the Stork Tower\\" () written by poet Wang Zhihuan (688-742). Alongside the Pavilion of Prince Teng, Yueyang Tower and Yellow Crane Tower, it is one of the Four Great Towers of China. Location Located in the juncture of Shanxi, Shaanxi and Henan, it has been an important traffic fort since ancient times. Yongji City, backing to the Zhongtiao Mountains and facing the Yellow River, is called Puzhou () historically. Now, the site of Puzhou ancient citystill exists. The thick city walls and tall gate towers are showing the prosperity of Puzhou City back then. Puzhou Ferry () is built outside the west gate of the Puzhou City. Four burly iron bulls and iron human statues in different folk costumes were once tightly tied to Pujin Floating Bridge () across the Yellow River. History Northern Zhou dynasty (557-581) According to the historical records, the Stork Tower was first built in the Northern and Southern dynasties (420-589) by Yuwen Hu (513-572), a powerful minister of the Northern Zhou dynasty (557-581). Arrogating all powers to himself, Yuwen Hu presided over state affairs of the Northern Zhou dynasty for over ten years. During his reign, he went in for large-scale construction to build many palaces and towers. Back then, Puzhou was the only way from Chang'an, the capital of the Northern Zhou dynasty, to Jinyang, the political center of the neighboring state Northern Qi dynasty (550-577). Guarding Puzhou, Yuwen Hu had Puzhou city reinforced to make it impregnable. Meanwhile, in order to keep a lookout for the enemy's situation, he also had a three-story tower built outside the city. It's said that after the tower was built, storks often perched on the tower, so it was named the Stork Tower. Some people say that Yuwen Hu had the Stork Tower built for not only military purposes, but also watching his mother by looking into the distance. It turned out that Yuwen Hu's mother was detained in Jinyang, today's Taiyuan in Shanxi, by the Northern Qi dynasty, a neighboring state of the Northern Zhou dynasty. The emperor of the Northern Qi dynasty asked Yuwen Hu's mother to write a letter with the clothes Yuwen Hu wore in childhood attached. After receiving the letter and clothes from his mother, he felt deeply sad and immediately wrote a letter back to his mother. Afterwards, he always kept up regular correspondence with his mother. It's said that Yuwen Hu often ascended the Stork Tower and overlooked the direction to Jinyang to ease his longing for his mother. In AD 572, Yuwen Hu was killed. Yuwen Yong (543-578), the emperor of the Northern Zhou dynasty, advocated frugality, so he had all gorgeous buildings built by Yuwen Hu destroyed by fire. Fortunately, the Stork Tower was preserved because of its military function of keeping a lookout for the border. Tang dynasty (618-907) The Stork Tower was built in the Northern Zhou dynasty and became prosperous in the Tang dynasty (618-907). Around in AD 704, Wang Zhihuan (688-742), a poet of the Tang dynasty, ascended the Stork Tower at dusk one day and wrote an eternally famous poem \\"On the Stork Tower\\" (). From then on, the Stork Tower became well known in the world. Countless people were attracted here by its reputation. Hezhong Prefecture () refers to Puzhou. In the 8th year of the Kaiyuan period of the Tang dynasty, namely in AD 720, Puzhou was upgraded to a prefecture and gained the name Hezhong Prefecture as it located in the midstream of the Yellow River. Jin dynasty (1115-1234) In the Zhenyou period of Jin dynasty (1115-1234), Emperor Xuanzong of Jin, Wanyan Xun (1163-1224), deeply felt the great threat from the Mongolian army and decided to move the capital to Hezhong Prefecture, also Puzhou, which was easy to guard but hard to attack. However, due to slow action, shortly after he decided to move the capital, the Mongolian army had occupied Pingyang, today's Linfen in Shanxi province. Puzhou became an isolated city. Emperor Xuanzong of Jin decided to abandon it. He ordered Aludai (), the garrison general of Puzhou, to set fire to Puzhou city. According to the records of \\"Prefecture Annals of Puzhou\\" (), in the first year of the Yuanguang period of Jin dynasty, namely in 1222, the Jin army fought against the Mongolian army, Hou Xiaoshu (), the general of Jin army, set fire to the Stork Tower. But \\"History of Jin\\" () denied this view. Yuan dynasty (1271-1368) Early in the 13th century, Mongolian tribes led by Genghis Khan (1162-1227) developed rapidly, extremely threatening the Jin dynasty (1115-1234). When attacking the Central Plains, the Mongolian cavalry fought with the Jin army fiercely. It is said that the Stork Tower was probably destroyed in the battle for the control of Puzhou between both sides. In the Yuan dynasty, when the famous scholar Wang Yun (; 1227-1304) came to the Stork Tower, he only saw the ruined base site of the Stork Tower. In the Yuan dynasty, people only saw the ruined base site, not the high-rise tower when visiting the Stork Tower. Ming dynasty (1368-1644) In the Ming dynasty (1368-1644), even the site of the Stork Tower couldn't be seen. In the Longqing period of the Ming dynasty, the Yellow River was breached. The river water flowed backward into Puzhou city and the site of Stork Tower was deeply buried in the sediment from then on. Modern era In 1990s, relevant departments decided to rebuild the Stork Tower. However, when browsing the historical material, people didn't find many records about the Stork Tower. And its exterior specification and structural features weren't narrated very clearly in the ancient documents. In March 1992, the relevant departments investigated the three towers south of the Yangtze River, back then, they spent ten days visiting five provinces and four cities with a distance of . They first visited Yellow Crane Tower, then Yueyang Tower, Pavilion of Prince Teng and Xunyang Tower in Jiujiang. When relevant departments visited each of these four towers, they should have a detailed discussion with the chief engineer of the construction unite to investigate and learn the reconstruction of ancient buildings, especially the reconstruction of high towers and pavilions, including their historical background, design basis, architectural styles and management in a detailed way, thus laying a solid foundation for the reconstruction of the Stork Tower. As the changes of old courses and sediment deposition of the Yellow River, experts decided to settle the site of the rebuilt Stork Tower on the shore of the Yellow River away from the Puzhou ancient city. Therefore, experts designed it according to the architecture form of the Tang dynasty (618-907), this time, experts also visited Shaanxi and Gansu from afar to look for train of thought from the imperial tombs of the Tang dynasty (618-907) and the Dunhuang grotto murals. What was worth mentioning was that, as the Stork Tower was very important historically, Chinese ancient architecture experts Zheng Xiaoxie (; 1916-2017) and Luo Zhewen (; 1924-2012) always paid great attention to the reconstruction of the Stork Tower. They carefully and thoroughly examined and approved of the design schemes and finally decided to take the second one of the four schemes as the criterion and put forward amendment opinions. The color decoration of Stork Tower was designed by Ma Ruitian (), a Chinese color painting expert of ancient architecture. More importantly, currently, the imitation color painting of the Tang dynasty (618-907) is very rare in China. The color decoration of the Stork Tower is a classical work among them. With joint efforts of many ancient architectural experts and constructors, the reconstructed Stork Tower finally showed up in front of people. Experts say that the famous towers represent a kind of emotion and the culture of famous towers is an important carrier of Chinese culture, as well as the bridge and link connecting the feelings for homeland of all Chinese in the world. Architecture The Stork Tower, has a total height of , which is equivalent to the height of a building with over 20 stories now, being a typical Tang- style stories building with a high base (). With three stories and four eaves, it has a circle corridor on the first floor and four backrooms. With a protruding corridor on the waist eaves, it also has a hipped roof. The inside layout and beautiful colored decoration both contain the style of the Tang dynasty (618-907). The present Stork Tower isn't located beside the Puzhou ancient city, but is about away from it. The tower is rebuilt, majestic and splendid, it sets off green trees and facing the rising sun, looking loftier. Literature Over 1000 years ago, Wang Zhihuan (688-742), a poet of the Tang dynasty (618-907), wrote a famous poem \\"On the Stork Tower\\" () spreading through the ages on it. \\"The sun beyond the mountain glows, while the Yellow River seawards flows. You can enjoy a great sight by climbing to a greater height.\\" () The poem, easy-to-understand, contains the vigorous and positive spirit and affects people for generations. The Stork Tower became famous because of it. Shen Kuo (1031-1095), an eminent scientist of Northern Song dynasty (960-1127), described the prosperity of the Stork Tower back then in his book \\"Dream Pool Essays\\" (): The three-story Stork Tower in Hezhong Prefecture, faces the Zhongtiao Mountains and overlooks the Yellow River. Many people of the Tang dynasty left poems here. However, only the poems of Li Yi (746/748‚Äì827/829), Wang Zhihuan (688-742) and Chang Zhu () can vividly describe the scenery of it. The Stork Tower appeared in the traditional Chinese painting \\"Painting of the Prosperous Middle Capital Puban\\" ().

The course of the Iserhoff river successively crosses the townships of Desjardins, Berthiaume and Bergeres. The hydrographic slope of the Iserhoff River is accessible from roads R1026 (North-South) and R1018 (North-South). These two roads are connected to the South at road 113 linking Lebel-sur-Qu√©villon to Chibougamau. The surface of the Iserhoff River is usually frozen from early November to mid-May, however, safe ice circulation is generally from mid- November to mid-April.  Geography  The main hydrographic slopes near the Iserhoff River are: *North side: Isernoff River North, Waswanipi River, Go√©land Lake (Waswanipi River), Imbault Brook; *East side: Lake Waswanipi, Bachelor River; *South side: Florence River, Wedding River, Bell River; *West side: Bell River, Indian River (Bell River). The Iserhoff River originates at the mouth of a little lake in mountains at an elevation of at: * South-west of the mouth of the Iserhoff River (confluence with Lake Waswanipi; * South-west of the mouth of Lake Waswanipi (confluence with the Waswanipi River); * South of the mouth of Go√©land Lake (Waswanipi River); * Southeast of the mouth of Matagami Lake; * Southeast of the mouth of the Nottaway River; * Southeast of downtown Matagami. From its source, the \\"Iserhoff River\\" flows on according to the following segments: Course of the Upper Iserhoff River (segment of ). * northeasterly in the canton of Desjardins, to the southern limit of the township of Berthiaume; * eastwards in the township of Berthiaume, passing on the south side of Mount Kitci (summit at ), to the western limit of the township of Bergeres; * north-east in the township of Berg√®res, until the confluence of two streams (coming from the North and the other from the South); * northeasterly, then north, to Imbault Brook; Course of the Lower Iserhoff River (segment of ) * east westerly to the confluence of the Iserhoff North River; * east to the R1018 forest road bridge; * easterly winding into a marsh zone to its mouth.Distances measured from the Atlas of Canada (published on the Internet) from the Department of Natural Resources Canada. The Iserhoff River flows into the Southwest Bay of Lake Waswanipi. From this mouth, the current flows East, then North, on the Lake Waswanipi to its mouth. From there, the current flows first north through the Waswanipi River, then west to the east shore of Go√©land Lake. The latter is crossed to the northwest by the Waswanipi River which is a tributary of Matagami Lake. The mouth of the Iserhoff River located at: * south-west of the mouth of Lake Waswanipi; * southeast of a bay south of Go√©land Lake (Waswanipi River); * southeast of the mouth of Go√©land Lake (Waswanipi River); * southeast of the mouth of Olga Lake (Waswanipi River); * south-west of the village center of Waswanipi; * North of downtown Matagami  Toponymy  This hydronym appears on an 1896 map of Surveyor Robert Bell, indicating it as a tributary of the Nottaway River. The name of this river evokes a missionary active in the region in the nineteenth century; in 1905, Henry O'Sullivan announced his presence at Fort Eastmain. A natural extension of [Mistassini Lake], called Baie Iserhoff, also evokes Charles Iserhoff, nephew of this missionary employed by the Hudson's Bay Company, at the former trading post of Baie-du-Poste; this site has become today the Cree village of Mistissini. This hydronym is reported in both editions of the Dictionary of Rivers and Lakes of the Province of Quebec (1914 and 1925). Jacques and Madeleine Rousseau used in 1946 the services of an informant (born Iserhoff), and then bearing the name of Mrs. Wilfrid Jefferys; according to his testimony, the members of this M√©tis family have always lived at either the Mistassini Lake or the Waswanipi station.

Despite laws promoting school integration since 1881, a 2017 study by the UCLA Civil Rights Project found that New Jersey has the sixth-most segregated classrooms in the United States. New Jersey has substantially smaller school districts per capita than other states, effectively dividing attendance by municipality. As a result, the proportion of highly segregated schools in New Jersey increased by two-thirds between 1989 and 2010, from 4.8% to 8%. Background New Jersey, the most densely populated state in the country and the second highest per capita income, has a well-developed public school system. A change to its constitution in 1947 outlawed overt segregation in schools, a decade before Brown v. Board of Education. In 1941, New Jersey had seventy districts with some form of formal segregation. Most of the segregation was in South Jersey, an agricultural region south of the Mason- Dixon Line. There was some in Bergen County, close to New York, where the average black classroom had 59 students. After World War II and the promulgation of the 1947 constitution, legally sanctioned segregation mostly went by the boards. That same constitution retained the state's commitment to home rule -- that townships and municipalities are the primary form of local government. Counties are relatively weak in New Jersey. The diversity of schools in New Jersey is a reflection of the communities they serve. In New Jersey there were 568 municipalities in 2017. In New Jersey there were 590 school districts in 2017. The Bordentown School (officially known as the Manual Training and Industrial School for Colored Youth), was a residential, publicly financed co-ed boarding school for African-American children in Bordentown. The school was known as the \\"Tuskegee of the North\\" for its adoption of many of the educational practices first developed at the Tuskegee Institute. Founded in 1886 and closed in 1955, the campus included two farms and 30 trade buildings.Keyes, Allison. \\"Documentary Focuses On 'Tuskegee Of The North'\\", National Public Radio, May 24, 2010. Accessed December 10, 2017. \\"In its prime, Bordentown was referred to as the Tuskegee of the North. Only Bordentown, unlike Booker T. Washington's Alabama institute wasn't private, it was a coed African-American school publicly financed by the state of New Jersey. It was only after the Brown vs. Board of Education decision that the state of New Jersey moved to shut down the school, citing its inability to attract white students. It closed in June of 1955.\\"Manual Training and Industrial School for Colored Youth at Bordentown, NJ: Institutional History, New Jersey Department of State. Accessed December 10, 2017.DeMasters, Karen. \\"On The Map; Remembering a Boarding School for Black Students\\", The New York Times, October 1, 2000. Accessed December 10, 2017. \\"The former campus of the Bordentown Manual and Training School, a residential school for black high school students in Burlington County, is now owned by the state. Some of the buildings, dating to 1886 when the school was founded, are used by the Department of Corrections to house juvenile offenders, but most are vacant and sinking into disrepair.... The school flourished until the 1950s, when the Brown vs. the Board of Education decision ended segregation. The school closed in 1955.\\" Studies Since 1996, the relative segregation of classrooms across the United States has been studied by the Civil Rights Project at Harvard until 2007 and subsequently at the Graduate School of Education and Information Studies at UCLA. The first report on New Jersey was published in 2012. The second was published in 2017. Findings Racial isolation for Latino students increased in the period 1989-2010. Black students had less isolation in some areas and persistent segregation in others. New Jersey has taken steps to equalize spending in the various school districts, including subsidies to 31 largely urban Abbott districts.Abbott Districts , Education Law Center. Accessed December 10, 2017.The History of Abbott v. Burke , Education Law Center. Accessed December 10, 2017. Contrast with the nation, region, and other states New Jersey has the sixth-most segregated classrooms in the United States. Initiatives New Jersey was, for the most part, not affected by court-ordered busing in the 1960s and 1970s. In Latino Action Network v. New Jersey, activists sued the state.

Originally scheduled to start in the summer of 2020, it has been postponed to 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Origins One-hundred-ball cricket was first proposed by the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) in September 2016, following discussions between the 18 first-class counties, the Professional Cricketers' Association (PCA) also and the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC), with a vote of 16‚Äì3 in favour of the format. On 26 April 2017, 38 members of the ECB voted to approve the proposal of a city-based competition. Each county is guaranteed at least ¬£1.3m per year. Essex, Middlesex and Kent were those who did not vote in favour. Thirty-eight votes was above the threshold of 31 which was required for approval. Essex had aired concerns over the how the reduced number of sides would focus in the competition on certain areas of the country, Middlesex would not have benefitted from the use of Lord's, because, unlike other counties, the club does not own its home ground, and Kent chose not to vote. Format Originally envisioned as a Twenty20 tournament, concerns over the relevance of the current competition structure and the opportunity to attract new fans prompted the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) to propose a shortened format. On 19 April 2018, the ECB announced the creation of 100-ball cricket, in which there would be 15 traditional six- ball overs and a final 10-ball over. Other mooted changes include removing the LBW law. The plan drew significant opposition but was supported by England captain Joe Root. On 21 February 2019, the ECB confirmed revised playing conditions in which there would be ten 10-ball overs with bowlers delivering five or 10 consecutive balls. One-hundred-ball cricket is a form of limited overs cricket, played by two teams each playing a single innings made up of 100 balls. The format of the game is: *100 balls per innings *A change of ends after 10 balls *Bowlers deliver either five or 10 consecutive balls *Each bowler can deliver a maximum of 20 balls per game *Each bowling side gets a strategic time-out of up to two and a half minutes *A 25-ball powerplay start for each team *Two fielders are allowed outside the initial 30-yard circle during the powerplay *Teams will be able to call time-outs, as has been the case in the IPL since 2009 *A simplified scoreboard is also proposed Reaction Some experts have stated that proposals for the new format outlined by the ECB are, at worst, nothing more than a small step further down \\"that alley\\", whereas others are appreciating it as a brilliant innovation. England's current Test captain, Joe Root, welcomed the ECB's plans for its new team format in 2020. According to Root, it will attract a completely new audience. ODI and T20 captain, Eoin Morgan, had a similar opinion about this format. Former T20 captain Stuart Broad said he was hugely optimistic about the new format. Michael Vaughan also echoed with Broad and stated that it will be a more appealing concept to broadcasters. Michael Atherton shared that a T20 match was to be completed in a 3-hour window and this can be achieved with the proposed format. New Zealand all-rounder Jimmy Neesham was bemused on this move, asking why the England and Wales Cricket Board was trying something different when the current format was already so successful. Current limited overs specialists Dawid Malan and Mark Wood shared that in spite of the new format, T20s will still remain as the preference. Former MCC chief Keith Bradshaw called the 100-ball tournament an innovation for innovation's sake, reasoning that the main reason behind this thought process is that the ECB couldn't exploit the T20 boom. The England and Wales Professional Cricketers' Association shared that, overall, players were open to this new idea. India captain Virat Kohli raised a few concerns about the commercialisation of cricket and was not entirely in favour of this new format. Meanwhile, Cricket Australia has no plans to tinker with its existing Big Bash League. It also shared a concern that the introduction of shorter formats is further ignoring Test cricket. In October 2019, after the teams and branding had been announced, anti-obesity groups criticised the sponsorship from snack food company KP Snacks. During the player draft on the 20 October 2019, the Twitter hashtag \\"#OpposeThe100\\" began trending from a vocal section of cricket fans dismayed at the format of the competition, particularly fans of counties whose home grounds are not among the eight represented city franchises. Tournament structure There will be eight city-based teams competing for the title over a 38-day period during the school summer holidays, which run from mid-July to early September. Each team will play four matches at home and four matches away (thereby playing their closest rival twice in a format similar to the Big Bash League), which means there will be a total of 32 games in the league that precedes the play-offs. The play-offs will include the top three teams at the conclusion of the league stage. The top team will progress directly to the final. The second and third teams will meet in a semi-final. The semi-final and final will be played at the same venue on the same day. Teams Before the eight teams were confirmed, it was reported that they would carry a different identity to the current county teams and would not be named after cities, counties or venues. In May 2019, the details of the team names were revealed to be: {  + !Team !Men's Venue !Women's Venue(s) !Men's Coach !Women's Coach !Ground - Manchester Originals Old Trafford Cricket Ground, Old Trafford, Manchester  Old Trafford Cricket Ground, Old Trafford, Manchester Sedbergh School, Sedbergh, Cumbria Simon Katich  frameless - Northern Superchargers Headingley Cricket Ground, Headingley, Leeds York Cricket Club South Northumberland Cricket Club Darren Lehmann Danielle Hazell frameless - Birmingham Phoenix Edgbaston Cricket Ground, Edgbaston, Birmingham New Road, Worcester Andrew McDonald Ben Sawyer frameless - Trent Rockets Trent Bridge, West Bridgford, Nottingham County Cricket Ground, Derby Grace Road, Leicester Stephen Fleming Salliann Briggs frameless - Welsh Fire () Sophia Gardens, Pontcanna, Cardiff Bristol County Ground County Ground, Taunton Gary Kirsten Matthew Mott frameless - London Spirit Lord's, St. John's Wood, London County Cricket Ground, Chelmsford County Cricket Ground, Northampton Shane Warne Lisa Keightley frameless - Oval Invincibles The Oval, Kennington, London The County Ground, Beckenham Tom Moody Lydia Greenway frameless - Southern Brave Rose Bowl, West End, Hampshire County Cricket Ground, Hove Mahela Jayawardene Charlotte Edwards frameless } Squads Each team is to be made up of 15 players, of whom a maximum of three may be overseas players.

Released with the Parlophone catalogue number BEP 14, the box set was the third in a series of format-based sets in the UK, after The Singles Collection 1962‚Äì1970 (1976) and The Beatles Collection (1978). As with the 1978 collection, the set is packaged in a dark blue box, with gold lettering used for the compilation title and the four band members' signatures. All of the 1960s EPs are presented in their original sleeve designs, while The Beatles uses the artwork from the band's 1967 double A-side single \\"Strawberry Fields Forever\\" / \\"Penny Lane\\". The four songs on the new EP (Parlophone SGE 1) are \\"The Inner Light\\", \\"Baby, You're a Rich Man\\", \\"She's a Woman\\" and \\"This Boy\\". In the case of \\"Baby, You're a Rich Man\\", the EP served as the debut UK release for the true stereo version of the track, which had previously been available only in mono or duophonic (\\"mock stereo\\") sound.

He has been Chair Professor and Head of the Department of Immunology at the University of T√ºbingen since 1996. Rammensee has contributed essentially to the research fields of MHC biology and tumor immunology and to the development of cancer immunotherapies. Life Rammensee studied Biology at the University of T√ºbingen and worked as a PhD student at the Max Planck Institute for Biology in T√ºbingen. After gaining his doctorate in 1982 he initially worked as a post-doctoral research fellow at Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, USA. In 1985 he moved as a scientific member to the Basel Institute for Immunology, Basel, Switzerland. Two years later Rammensee returned to Max Planck Institute for Biology as a group leader at the department of immunogenetics. 1993 he became head of department at the Tumor- Virus-Immunology Section of the German Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg, Germany. The same year he was appointed professor at the Faculty of Theoretical Medicine of Heidelberg University. He has been a Full Professor at the University of T√ºbingen and Chair of the Department of Immunology at the Institute for Cell Biology since 1996. Research Since the late 1970s, Rammensee has been focusing on immunology with the specific aim of using tumor immunology to fight against cancer. He has contributed to genetics and immune regulation as well as to the understanding of minor H antigens, T cells and the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). His group has systematically developed bioinformatics tools for this purpose. In recent years, Rammensee has combined basic research on MHC biology with translational research, thus bringing tumor immunology into clinical practice. Currently he is focusing on the development of individualized cancer immunotherapy. In 2000 and 2010, Rammensee co-founded three research-based companies. Immatics is involved in the development of cancer immunotherapies, CureVac develops therapies based on messenger RNA (mRNA); synimmune on recombinant antibodies.

The estate has belonged to the famous musician Sting and his wife Trudie Styler since the late 1990s. History Il Palagio was built in the 17th century. In the late 18th century it was bought by the wealthy Martelli family. They sold it in 1819 to Countess Carlotta Barbolani of Montauto, the widow of the Duke of San Clemente and it remained in this family's hands for some 150 years. In the early 20th century Duke Simone Vincenzo Velluti Zati di San Clemente was responsible for building an oil mill and grain store and beginning to produce wine in its vineyards. A chapel was added in 1958. The estate was bought by Sting and his wife Trudie Styler since the late 1990s. When the couple bought the villa it was in a state of disrepair and they hired architect Arabella Lennox-Boyd to carry out a full restoration of the estate, which took seven years. On 11 September 2001, Sting and a large ensemble of musicians recorded the live album All This Time at the villa on the same day at the September 11 terrorist attacks. Sting's song \\"Fragile\\" was dedicated the victims of the attacks. In 2009, winter photography of the grounds covered in snow was taken for Sting's album release that year, If on a Winter's Night.... Both that and his 2006 album Songs from the Labyrinth were written at the estate. The second phase of rehearsals for The Police Reunion Tour took place over the course of four weeks at the estate in the spring of 2007. Sting and Trudie often host parties and private concerts for friends and family at Il Palagio. Features Built in the 16th century Tuscan style, the estate contains four guesthouses and two annexes to the main villa which can accommodate up to 50 guests, and up to 500 guests for wedding receptions and parties. The estate has a life-size chessboard, a tree house overlooking a lake, a chapel and a giant statue of Buddha, a yoga centre, a tennis court, and a swimming pool. Produce The estate, of some 350 hectares, is run by Paolo Rossi and his brother Joe who is the head chef. Gluten-free breads and pizzas are on the menu. The estate is a producer of wine, honey, cherries, apricots, peaches and olive oil. It has been making organic olive oil since 1999. As of 2014, the estate produces six different wines.

It is situated in Kresna Municipality, Blagoevgrad Province. The reserve is managed by the administration of Pirin National Park despite the fact it lies outside the limits of the park.  Statute and location  Tisata was declared a nature reserve by Order No. 6633 of the Ministry of Forestry on 5 December 1949 under the name Tisova Barchina to protect the largest natural habitat of Greek juniper (Juniperus excelsa) in Bulgaria. Initially it encompassed a territory of 19 ha but was expanded several times and nowadays occupies 584 ha or 5.84 km2, as well as a buffer zone of 420 ha. The borders of the reserve were determined in 1991. The territory of the reserve is divided into two separate sections by the southern reaches of the Kresna Gorge on the Struma River. The western section occupies the eastern slopes of the Maleshevo mountain range, while the eastern one is situated on the north-western slopes of the Pirin mountains. The altitude of the reserve ranges between 300 and 700 m. In terms of geology the most common rock type is gneiss. The climate is continental Mediterranean; the predominate soil type are leached cinnamon forest soils. The soils on the foothills of Pirin are partially exposed to erosion.  Flora  There are 460 species of vascular plants. About 80% of the reserve's territory is covered by forests dominated by Greek juniper, a relict species that evolved in Asia Minor. There trees are 10 to 15 m but some individuals can reach 20 m and a diametre of 1 m. The Greek juniper forms monotypic or mixed forests with trees such as Oriental hornbeam (Carpinus orientalis), pubescent oak (Quercus pubescens) and South European flowering ash (Fraxinus ornus). Rarer tree or large shrub species include Jerusalem thorn (Paliurus spina-christi) and prickly juniper (Juniperus oxycedrus). Another important tree species is the evergreen European yew (Taxus baccata). There are a number of Mediterranean herbaceous plants such as Fritillaria graeca, Colchicum bivonae, Anemone pavonina, woodland tulip (Tulipa sylvestris), etc.  Fauna  The fauna includes many species that are found in the southernmost regions of Europe. The ornithofauna is very diverse and includes 109 nesting species in the reserve's limited territory. There are 62 species of European conservation importance. In 1997 the reserve, the buffer zone and the Moravska protected area were declared a site of ornithological importance. Of the breeding bird species 30% are characteristic for the Mediterranean biome, including blue rock thrush, common rock thrush, western Orphean warbler, Sardinian warbler, subalpine warbler, olive-tree warbler, black-eared wheatear, black-headed bunting, masked shrike, western rock nuthatch, rock partridge, etc. Important birds of prey include short-toed snake eagle and Eurasian eagle-owl. The herpetofauna is also varied and includes 11 snake species, such as European ratsnake, Dahl's whip snake, European cat snake, four-lined snake and European blind snake, and two turtle taxa, spur-thighed tortoise and Hermann's tortoise.

Found amongst sand dunes and heathlands, it is a polymorphic species, with a wide range of variants. In the UK, at least, these range from small, prostrate, hairless plants at one end of the spectrum to taller, erect or ascending silky-leaved shrubs at the other. This wide variation in form has resulted in numerous synonyms. Distribution The plant has a Eurosiberian Boreo-temperate range, and is widely distributed around the coasts of western and northern Europe. In the UK, the prostrate forms (ssp. argentea and ssp. repens) are characteristically found on sand dunes, growing close to the water table in dune slacks, as well as in coastal heaths and acid grassland, as well as being found further inland on heaths and moorland. The erect form (var. fusca) occurs in fens. The species becomes more confined to moist or wet habitats in the southern and eastern parts of its UK range, and has been recorded from sea level up to (in East Perthshire). Ecology Dunes containing Salix repens are recognised as being of ecological importance by the EU Habitats Directive. Over 132 Natura 2000 sites are designated for this habitat type. As the water table lowers within the slack, these Salix-dominated habitats (termed Salicion arenariae) may develop either into mesophilous (neither wet nor dry), or xerophilous (dry) communities. The former may contain species such as Pyrola rotundifolia, Viola canina and Monotropa hypopitys; the latter containing Carlina vulgaris and Thalictrum minus. Salix repens provides shelter to other species of plant and animal. Its soft, fluffy seed hairs provide nesting material for songbirds, whilst in autumn there is often a rich assemblage of unusual fungus species growing in its vicinity. Should the dune slack that the plant inhabits become inundated by an advancing dune, it is able to adapt and change its growth form from erect to prostrate. Losing its erect habit, the plant is able to creep horizontally along the front of the advancing dune and survive the changing conditions. Studies have shown that mycorrhizal fungal associations may assist Salix repens in expanding the ecological niches it can occupy. Hybrids Creeping willow may hybridise with other Salix species, typically including goat willow (S. caprea) and downy willow (S. lapponum). One especially rare hybrid (S. x angusensis) was discovered on Ainsdale Nature Reserve, Lancashire in 1993. It is a hybrid between three Salix species: S. cinerea ssp. oleifolia x S. repens var. argentea X S. viminalis.

The family contains seven genera.  Description  Dolichosaurus was a small marine squamate at about 0.5 to 1 meter in total length. Coniasaurus was similarly sized at about 0.5 meters in length. They were elongated (especially apparent in the neck) marine lizards with reduced limbs and small, thin heads. Dolichosaurs may have occupied a niche similar to the earlier nothosaurs and modern sea snakes, in using their thin heads to feed in crevices and narrow spaces along coral reefs and rocky shores. The degree to which the limbs were reduced suggest that the dolichosaurs would have been unable to generate any significant movement on land, and they thus likely spent most of their time underwater. Though the reduction of the limbs have no obvious evolutionary advantage, it is an adaptation that might be shared with early snakes.  History of discovery  Both of the genera routinely referred to the Dolichosauridae, Dolichosaurus and Coniasaurus, were described by Richard Owen in 1850 based on specimens of Cenomanian age collected from the Lower Chalk of southeastern England.Owen, R. 1850. Description of the Fossil Reptiles of the Chalk Formation; pp. 378‚Äì404 in F. Dixon (ed.), The Geology and Fossils of the Tertiary and Cretaceous Formations. The unusually large number of dorsal and cervical vertebrae present in Dolichosaurus prompted it to be named as a new genus and Coniasaurus could be distinguished from known Cretaceous lizards by dental characteristics. Nopcsa (1908)Nopcsa, F. 1908. Zur kenntnis der fossilen Eidechsen. Beitra¬®ge zur Pala¬®ontologie und Geologie O¬®sterreich-Ungarns und des Orients 21: 33‚Äì62. restudied the specimens discovered by Owen and described several new specimens of Coniasaurus and Dolichosaurus.  Classification  Both known species of Coniasaurus, C. gracilodens and C. crassidens, are known from disarticulated skulls with isolated vertebral elements. In contrast, Dolichosaurus longicollis, the only species of Dolichosaurus, is known from postcranial skeletons with only very fragmentary skulls and no teeth. This has made the exact nature of their relation difficult to determine. Coniasaurus and Dolichosaurus are generally considered to be either nested within basal mosasauroids as a third group alongside mosasaurs and aigialosaurs, or as the sister group to the mosasauroids. The difficulties in establishing more certain relationships not only between the Dolichosauridae and the Mosasauroidea, but also between Dolichosaurus and Coniasaurus, arise from the nature of the fossil remains referred to the genera. With Coniasaurus largely lacking postcranial material and Dolichosaurus largely lacking cranial material, they are difficult to compare with each other. Studies that propose a close relation between snakes and mosasauroids in a group dubbed Pythonomorpha demonstrate the importance of Dolichosaurus, Coniasaurus and other Late Cretaceous marine squamates in squamate phylogeny and evolutionary history. The hypothesis suggesting that snakes, mosasaurs, aigialosaurs and dolichosaurs share a common aquatic ancestor is not universally accepted and stands in stark contrast with the previously widespread hypothesis of snakes having a fossorial origin. The cladogram below is based on Palci and Caldwell (2010a), Caldwell and Palci (2010b), placing the Dolichosauridae as a sister group to modern snakes and their closest ancestors.

Life  Sigrid L√∂ffler was born in Aussig (as it was known till 1945) in Czechoslovakia, at the height of the Second World War. As she later spelled out to an interviewer, she was presumably conceived while her father was on leave from the frontline. Her mother's family came from the northern border region of Bohemia that had more recently become known as the Sudetenland. During the ethnic cleansing of 1945 her mother took her to rejoin her father in Vienna where he was rebuilding his peace-time career as a teacher. It was in Vienna - under military occupation till 1955 - that she grew up, acutely aware of her \\"outsider status\\" as a Protestant in a conservative city determined, during the 1950s, to recreate its catholic (pre-Nazi) past. At the university she worked on English studies, German studies, Philosophy and Pedagogy, receiving a master's degree. Her doctorate followed in 1966. Her father's wish was that she should follow him into the teaching profession, which briefly she did, teaching German as a foreign language in England during 1966/67. After this experience L√∂ffler decided to pursue a career in journalism, working between 1968 and 1972 as a foreign political editor with Die Presse, a liberal centrist daily newspaper based in Vienna. Between 1972 and 1993 she was on the editorial team of the Vienna based news magazine, Profil, ending up as head of arts and culture and deputy editor in chief. She was also working as arts correspondent for several major newspapers (S√ºddeutsche Zeitung, Die Zeit, Die Woche}, magazines and broadcasters. Between 1996 and 1999 L√∂ffler was in charge of the Feuilleton section of Die Zeit. In 1988 Sigrid L√∂ffler became a regular participant in \\"Das Literarische Quartett\\" (\\"The Literary Quartet\\"), a weekly television programme produced by West Germany's ZDF broadcasting operator in collaboration (at that time) with Austria's ORF. The programme presented book reviews provided (and argued over) by its permanent panel of four literary critics. L√∂ffler left the panel in June 2000, complaining because a fellow panelist, the literary critic Marcel Reich-Ranicki had put forward Haruki Murakami's erotic novel South of the Border, West of the Sun for discussion. Describing the book as \\"literary fast food\\", L√∂ffler made it clear that she found it inappropriately trivial for inclusion in a series devoted to serious literature. Her fellow panelist, the widely revered critic Marcel Reich- Ranicki, retorted that she had a problem with erotic literature in general. Although differences over the Murakami provided a catalyst for L√∂ffler's widely publicised departure from the programme, it does appear that tensions between L√∂ffler and Reich-Ranicki were more broadly based and longstanding, having indeed nourished the programme's dynamic over the years. Her empty seat was taken by Iris Radisch until the series was dropped at the end of 2001. (It has subsequently been reformatted and revived by ZDF.) After stepping down from \\"Literary Quartet\\", in August 2000 L√∂ffler became the producer for the literary journal \\"Literaturen\\", stepping down a little over eight years later following differences over whether or not to take the publication down-market. L√∂ffler opposed moving \\"Literaturen\\" down-market.  Literary prize juries and more controversy  Sigrid L√∂ffler drew strong criticism as a jury member for the Alfred Toepfer Foundation when together with fellow jury member Gertrud Fussenegger she voted to award the 1991 Franz Grillparzer Literary Prize to the politically controversial novelist Peter Handke. She has also been a member of the jury for the Leipzig Book Fair and for the Heinrich Heine Prize. In 2006 she announced her resignation from the Heinrich Heine Prize jury in connection with plans to award this prize to (the still controversial) Peter Handke. In doing so she expressed her exasperation over fellow jurors whom she believed had introduced \\"unsubstantiated and damaging assertions into play\\". (In the end, because of disputes stirred up by Handke's political views, the Heinrich Heine Prize was not awarded in 2006.)

Clemson was a long steel-hulled Great Lakes freighter that went missing on 1 December 1908, on Lake Superior. The ship was last seen coming through the Soo Locks, onto Lake Superior. The ship was built in 1903 for the Provident Steamship Company. She is known for sinking on Lake Superior, on the night of 1 December 1908 with all hands; 24 men lost their lives. The wreck of D.M. Clemson is still missing, and the cause of her sinking remains a mystery to this day. Possible cause of the sinking Frederick Stonehouse (a historian and author) discussed the disappearance of the Clemson in his book \\"Went Missing\\". According to Stonehouse the Clemson suffered some structural damage when she struck a lighthouse pier at Ashtabula, Ohio on October 20, 1908. The incident damaged 10 hull plates and a water tank on the starboard side. Temporary repairs were made until the Clemson went into layup for the winter of 1908. Another theory suggests that the Clemson's wooden hatch covers failed causing water to leak into the cargo hold and sink the ship. Aftermath There were no survivors to tell what happened to the ship. However, for weeks debris and some bodies from the 24 crew members washed ashore from the ill-fated ship between Crisp Point and Grand Marais. One of the bodies found was the body of the Clemson's watchman, Simon Dunn of Dublin, Ireland, which washed ashore at Crisp Point. Dunn was wearing a life jacket with D.M. Clemson written on it. Later, pieces of the ship's cabin, 23 of the ship's wooden hatch covers and at least three more bodies were seen floating further west. Only one other body was recovered, and was identified as second mate Charles Woods of Marine City, Michigan. A second vessel named D.M. Clemson was launched in 1917.

In this 15-20 minute, family-oriented game, players build a five by five kingdom of oversized domino-like tiles, making sure as they place each tile that one of its sides connects to a matching terrain type already in play. In 2017 Kingdomino won the Spiel des Jahres award for the best board game of the year.  Gameplay  Game situation between two players in Kingdomino In the game players take turns choosing domino like tiles and adding them to their kingdoms. Like traditional Dominoes, each tile has one or two different ends, which in this case also show different landscapes, and possibly a number of crowns on it. Choosing a tile with the most crowns gives a player last choice in the next round for choosing a tile, and vice versa - choosing the worst tile now ensures the first choice in the following round. When a tile is placed next to other tiles of the same landscape, they form a larger property. Each kingdom can be no larger than a 5x5 grid of landscapes. The game ends when the tiles run out, and then each property is scored based on how big it is, multiplied by the number of crowns in it. The player with the most points in all their properties wins. There is also a two player variant of the game which allows players to form a larger 7x7 grid of tiles. Kingdomino is considered by reviewers to be an accessible entry point into strategy board games, with its 15‚Äì20 minute playing time and its familiar game mechanics which bear similarity to Dominoes.  Reception  The Guardian called Kingdomino \\"the standout game of the past 12 months\\".  Spinoffs and expansions  In 2017, Blue Orange Games released Queendomino, a standalone board game which uses tile laying gameplay similar to the original, but adds knights, dragons, a queen, and buildings to build. This was followed in 2018 by the release of Kingdomino Age of Giants, an expansion for both Kingdomino and Queendomino. Kingdomino Duel was released in 2019 as a two player, roll and write version of the game.

History Original logo of Progressive Slovakia The party was registered with the Slovak Interior Ministry on November 28, 2017, after the submission of 13,500 signatures. The party's founding congress was held on January 20, 2018, which resulted in being elected as the party's chairman. ≈†tefunko views the left‚Äìright political spectrum as obsolete, instead aiming for the party to be a centrist and liberal political movement, claiming that \\"Slovakia is full of people who want a modern, open and European country\\". However, ≈†tefunko stepped down as the party's leader in 2019 following criticism of his past involvement in business and politics, although the official reasoning for his resignation was health issues. ≈†tefunko was replaced by former deputy leader . Truban is an IT professional, an entrepreneur, and an anti-corruption activist, who also favors digitalization of governance and bureaucracy. Zuzana ƒåaputov√°, who was a former member of Progressive Slovakia, became the first female president in Slovakia's history. The party first gained attention in 2018 when its favored candidate, Mat√∫≈° Vallo, won the municipal elections in Bratislava, and subsequently became the city's mayor. After the 2019 Slovak presidential election, the victory of Progressive Slovakia's presidential candidate, 45-year-old lawyer Zuzana ƒåaputov√°, was hailed by international media commentators as a victory of liberalism over right-wing populism. According to Professor Michael Rossi, ƒåaputov√°'s popularity is related to her appeal as an outsider amidst frustration over political corruption and clientelism among the electorate. ƒåaputov√° first gained fame as a campaigner against a toxic waste dump created by real estate brokers who were connected to the ruling Smer-SD, which led to many commentators describing her as the \\"Slovak Erin Brokovich\\". While campaigning for the presidency, ƒåaputov√° focused on the issues of corruption, inflation, justice, the environment, and overhaul of healthcare, and ran on the slogan \\"stand up to evil\\". She stayed silent on the issue of immigration and open borders, which most Slovaks are opposed to, and was the only major candidate not to condemn the Global Compact on Migration. The party also got the highest share in the 2019 European Parliament election in Slovakia, earning over 20.1% of the vote and becoming the largest party represented in the Slovak section of the European Parliament, with the establishment Smer-SD's 15.7% and the neo-fascist Kotleba ‚Äì People's Party Our Slovakia's 12.1%. For the 2020 Slovak parliamentary election, Progressive Slovakia signed a cooperation agreement and non-aggression pact with former president Andrej Kiska's extra-parliamentary Za ƒæud√≠ (For the People) party and the Christian Democratic Movement. However on election day, in rather stunning fashion, the PS/Spolu coalition narrowly missed on entering the National Council after finishing with 6.96% of the vote, as coalitions must reach a threshold of 7% in order to enter parliament.

A film adaptation of her book, Molly's Game, starring Jessica Chastain and directed by Aaron Sorkin, debuted in December 2017. Early life Bloom was born on April 21, 1978, and grew up in Loveland, Colorado. Her father, Larry Bloom, is a clinical psychologist and a professor at Colorado State University. Her mother, Char, was a ski and snowboard instructor and a professional fly-fisher with her own line of clothing. Bloom's father is Jewish and her mother is Christian. Her brothers are Jordan Bloom, a surgeon at Massachusetts General Hospital, and Jeremy Bloom, who was an American Olympic skier and professional American football player with the Philadelphia Eagles. She was a competitive skier and at one time ranked third in Nor-Am Cup for women's moguls skiers; she later suffered an injury while trying to qualify for the Olympics. She attended the University of Colorado Boulder, where she graduated summa cum laude with a Bachelor of Arts in Political Science.  Poker game  In 2004, Bloom moved to Los Angeles and found work as a barmaid. In 2004, Darin Feinstein, one of the co-owners of The Viper Room, was approached by actor Tobey Maguire about hosting a high-stakes poker game in the basement of the club. Feinstein recruited Bloom to cater to the players and manage the game. In 2007, Bloom started her own business, registering Molly Bloom Inc. as an event and catering company to host poker tournaments. By 2008, the games had graduated to private homes and hotels like the Peninsula Beverly Hills, with hands going as high as $4 million. In addition to Maguire, many wealthy individuals, celebrities and sports figures were known to frequent the games including Leonardo DiCaprio, Alec Gores, Macaulay Culkin, Matt Damon, Ben Affleck, Alex Rodriguez, Nelly, Mary Kate Olsen, Ashley Olsen, Phil Ivey, Rick Salomon and Andy Beal. The onset of the 2008 recession made underground poker games less common, and in 2009, Bloom moved to an Upper West Side high-rise near Manhattan's Lincoln Center. She began organizing games in a private apartment at the new Astor Place and suites at the Plaza Hotel, which used the same sophisticated dealing equipment used in casinos, and which were staffed by women hired from 1 Oak, an exclusive nightclub. However, Bloom had fewer contacts in New York, where raids on underground games prompted them to relocate to Long Island. As a result of this, Bloom attracted rich businessmen from Wall Street but also more disreputable gamblers whose bids were significantly smaller than those in Los Angeles. In June 2010, Bloom was served with a $116,133 tax lien for failing to pay appropriate taxes on her New York events.  Arrest and sentencing  In 2011, one of Bloom's games in Los Angeles was shut down as part of a bankruptcy investigation into a Ponzi scheme run by Bradley Ruderman, one of the players. Bloom, who had received money from Ruderman as part of the game, was accused of receiving $473,000 from Ruderman's bank to settle his debts and sued by the bankruptcy trustee for $473,200, but she denied that she was involved in organizing illegal gambling. Bank records showed 19 transfers to Bloom in 2007 and 2008 for amounts up to $57,500. On April 16, 2013, Bloom was arrested and charged along with 33 others as part of a $100 million money laundering and illegal sports gambling operation. Preet Bharara, the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, charged 12 people with racketeering. Others were charged with money laundering, extortion, fraud and operating illegal poker rooms in New York City. Bloom, who was 34 at the time, faced a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison, six years of supervised release, a fine of $1.5 million or twice the amount gained from the crimes or twice the amount lost by victims, and a $200 special assessment. In May 2014, Bloom pleaded guilty to a lesser charge and was sentenced to one year of probation and 200 hours of community service. At the sentencing, Bloom's lawyer, Jim Walden, told the court that Bloom was in severe debt which included forfeiting $125,000 in poker proceeds as part of the plea. He stated that Bloom had \\"been ordered into the gambling business\\" by her boss at a Los Angeles real estate company, then went on to create her own illegal poker game in New York in 2009.  Book and film  Bloom's memoir about her experiences, Molly's Game: The True Story of the 26-Year-Old Woman Behind the Most Exclusive, High-Stakes Underground Poker Game in the World, was published in 2014. A film adaptation of the book, called Molly's Game, written and directed by Aaron Sorkin, premiered at the Toronto Film Festival on September 8, 2017. Jessica Chastain plays the role of Molly Bloom. The film received a 2018 Academy Award nomination in the category Best Adapted Screenplay.

History The Southern Punjab Railway Company was formed in 1895 with Bradford Leslie as Chairman. Under contract with the Secretary of State for India, Leslie and his partners formed the company to build a BG railway from Delhi to Samasata about 400 miles to the west. Horace Bell was the consulting engineer for SPR in London for the construction. The main line ran northwest from Delhi to Bathinda then southwest through Bahawalpur State to Samasata, a total distance of 402 miles (643 km). Several extension lines (Jullunder, Sutlej Valley etc.) extended the length to 502 miles(803 km) in 1905. In 1873, metre gauge Delhi-Rewari line from the Delhi-Rewari section of Rajputana-Malwa Railway was extended to Hisar, and then to Bhatinda in 1883‚Äì84, connecting it all the way to Karachi via Delhi-Karachi line. The railway was worked by the North Western State (NWR) Railway (see \\"Records L/AG/46/34\\"). The railway eventually became part of Indian Railways.

The brand is very popular in Spain, similar to what Gauloises is in France. Ducados is Spanish for Dutchy. History Old Spanish pack of Ducados The brand was introduced in 1963. The original Ducados cigarettes (\\"Ducados Negros\\") were strong and mainly smoked by men. As more women joined the workforce in and after the 1960s, the black cigarettes became less popular because many women didn't like the bad taste that it left in their mouths. Noticing this, Altadis released a Rubio (\\"Blonde\\") variant which was lighter, and became more popular than the Negros. Ducados is probably the most representative Spanish cigarette brand, with its well-built and rich flavor. In Spain, this brand is called \\"Tabaco negro\\" (Black tobacco) due to its supposed purity and the use of less chemical which make its color a lot darker than any other brands. Ducados cigarettes are made with 100% Canarian tobacco and it's probably the only brand in Spain that uses white filter tips which makes Ducados a very distinguishable brand. Due to the popularity of the brand, Ducados cigarettes (along with other cheap brands) are often reserved by \\"tobacco tourists\\" from Great Britain and France while they go on holiday in Spain.

Early life He was born in Wakefield and studied at a Methodist boarding school in Harrogate, Ashville College. He was exempt from National Service due to his asthma and he studied English with philosophy at the University of Nottingham.Richard McCabe and Brian Watchorn, 'Howard Erskine-Hill', Biographical Memoirs of Fellows of the British Academy, XVIII (2019), pp. 1‚Äì13. He graduated with a BA in 1957 and then embarked on his PhD thesis (also at Nottingham), titled \\"Tradition and Affinity in the Poetry of Pope\\".The Times, 'Howard Erskine-Hill, 1936-2014' (17 April 2014), retrieved 10 December 2017. Academic career From 1960 to 1965 Erskine-Hill taught English at the University of Wales, Swansea, ending his time there as senior lecturer. From 1965 to 1984 he was a lecturer in English at Cambridge University, then reader (1984‚Äì94) and professor of literary history (1994‚Äì2003). From 1969 until 1980 he was a Fellow of Jesus College, Cambridge and in 1985 was elected Fellow of the British Academy, where he served on the publications committee (1987‚Äì94). In 1964 Oxford University Press published Erskine-Hill's edition of Horace's Satires and Epistles. His Social Milieu of Alexander Pope was published by Yale University Press in 1975 and sought to place Pope's work in its historical context by analysing six figures who featured prominently in Pope's life and poetry. In his review, Donald Davie said the book was \\"one of those very rare books which truly deserve the description: humane scholarship. It is very learned indeed. ... [H]is book is a great achievement, and also a great pleasure. ... I do not know when literary scholarship in England came up with anything so deeply satisfying\\".Donald Davie, 'Review: The Social Milieu of Alexander Pope: Lives, Example, and the Poetic Response by Howard Erskine-Hill', The Modern Language Review, Vol. 73, No. 2 (Apr., 1978), pp. 406-407. His next book, The Augustan Idea in English Literature, was published in 1983 and explored how writers from the time of Shakespeare to Pope used the Roman Emperor Augustus and his associated poets Virgil and Horace as a model to praise or criticise politics.Howard D. Weinbrot, Review: The Emperor's Old Toga: Augustanism and the Scholarship of Nostalgia Review: The Augustan Idea in English Literature by Howard Erskine-Hill', Modern Philology, Vol. 83, No. 3 (Feb., 1986), pp. 286-297 Erskine-Hill explained in the preface: > The word ‚ÄòIdea‚Äô in my title is not intended to suggest that the English > reception of Rome's Augustan Age involved one idea alone, as it might be for > example, of peaceful empire, or of enlightened patronage of poets. ‚ÄòIdea‚Äô > must perforce stand for a shifting pattern of ideas, some diametrically > opposed, if pressed to their extreme forms. The grateful view of Virgil and > Horace; the penetrating and hostile view of Tacitus; and the Christian > providential view of Eusebius, each quite different from the others, are the > major components of what may for the sake of brevity be termed the Augustan > Idea. Separated out, they formed the arguments in a debate about the nature > of Augustan Rome. Drawn together they composed a compound image in which > compatibility was more evident than contradiction.Howard Erskine-Hill, The > Augustan Idea in English Literature (London: Hodder Arnold, 1993), pp. > xi‚Äìxii. In the book's introduction he explained: \\"Evidence has been presented and conclusions based on that evidence. I acknowledge the principle of truth as the end of scholarship, and have no interest in the production of subjective myth in the guise of criticism, or in the mere multiplication of readings none of which has any greater probability than the rest\\".Erskine-Hill, Augustan Idea in English Literature, p. 13. In his review, Frank Kermode complained of the \\"vanity\\" of Erskine-Hill's \\"mock-modest tone\\" in the introduction and said it was \\"quite deplorable\\" from \\"so pedestrian an author to put on such airs\\".Frank Kermode, 'Review: The Augustan Idea', The Kenyon Review, New Series, Vol. 6, No. 2 (Spring, 1984), pp. 132-133. Emrys Jones called it \\"an ambitious and impressive work\\" which was not only \\"exceptional in the scope and quality of its reading but deeply considered in what it has to say\\".Emrys Jones, 'Reviewed Work: The Augustan Idea in English Literature by Howard Erskine-Hill', The Modern Language Review, Vol. 80, No. 2 (Apr., 1985), pp. 423-424. In 1992 Erskine-Hill unsuccessfully opposed Cambridge University's bestowal of an honorary degree on Jacques Derrida because he had derided the value of truth and that such academic recognition of Derrida would undermine educational standards. The pamphlet he wrote with Hugh Mellor exclaimed that \\"the major preoccupation and effect of [Derrida's] voluminous work has been to deny and to dissolve those standards of evidence and argument on which all academic disciples are based\\". In order to commemorate the 250th anniversary of Pope's death, Erskine-Hill set up a symposium in May 1994. This led to him being appointed to give the Warton Lecture on \\"Pope and Slavery\\". This and other papers from the symposium were published in the Proceedings of the British Academy in 1998.\\"Alexander Pope: World and Word\\", Proceedings of the British Academy, Volume 91 (1998). In 1996 Oxford University's Clarendon Press published his two companion volumes on the relationship between politics and literature from William Shakespeare to William Wordsworth, Poetry and the Realm of Politics and Poetry of Opposition and Revolution. He explained in the introduction to the first volume: > The chief contention of this book is that there is a political comment, > often involving contemporary political ideas and historical circumstance, in > some of the most powerful poetic works of sixteenth- and seventeenth-century > English literature, works which have in the past been usually read for their > aesthetic achievement and generalized wisdom. I argue that this political > component is an eventual part of their aesthetic life, and that that, in its > turn, is part of that wider historical culture which it is the vocation of > scholarship to explore with as much imagination and disinterestedness as it > can.Howard Erskine-Hill, Poetry and the Realm of Politics: Shakespeare to > Dryden (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1996), p. 1. In 2008 Erskine-Hill's festschrift was published, edited by David Womersley and Richard McCabe. They said in the preface that Erskine-Hill's works \\"range from the most magisterial of research monographs to the most accessible of student introductions. ... In Howard the teacher and the scholar are one\\".David Womersley and Richard McCabe, 'Preface' in Womersley and McCabe (eds.), Literary Milieux: Essays in Text and Context Presented to Howard Erskine-Hill (University of Delaware Press, 2008), p. 7. Personal life Erskine-Hill's political views were originally left-wing; he was a Labour voter and a supporter of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament but he moved to the right whilst at Cambridge. Although he voted for James Callaghan's Labour Party in 1979 and admired Margaret Thatcher's leadership during the Falklands War, during the 1983 general election he complained: \\"If you believe in democratic procedure and in defence, you cannot vote Labour this time. If you believe in government support for the economy and unemployment, you cannot vote Tory\\". Later on he embraced Euroscepticism; in 1991 he wrote to Thatcher to try and dissuade her from retiring from the House of Commons so that she could lead the campaign against a federal Europe. He also supported her idea of a referendum on the subject. He later supported the UK Independence Party. Throughout his life he was a supporter of Amnesty International. Abandoning the atheism of his student days, he joined the Church of England. In 1994, after the Church of England decided to ordain women, he converted to the Roman Catholic Church.

The fire, which was started by a lightning strike, was reported on August 7, 2017, and burned a total of . The fire threatened numerous private property and structures, as well as recreational and historical sites in the forest. Events August The Gibralter Fire was started by lightning and was first reported on August 7, 2017 at 9:06 PM in the Kootenai National Forest, seven miles east of Eureka. Burning in steep, inaccessible terrain and fueled by grass and understory timber, the Gibralter Fire caused immediate evacuations of residents in four areas of the forest and closed over 20 forest service roads east and north of U.S. Route 93 and numerous other areas of the forest, including Grave Creek Camp Ground, Bunchgrass Camp Ground, Clarence Creek Guard Station, Birch Creek Recreation Area, Big and Little Therriault Camp Ground, Horse Camp, Stahl Peak Lookout, Mount Wam Lookout and Wolverine Cabin. Temporary re-entry was allowed for residents over the course of the week. Red flag warning were declared on August 12. Evacuation orders were lifted on August 14, however evacuation warnings and specific closures remained in place. By August 20, the Gibralter Fire had grown to and was 13% contained with 425 fire personnel fighting the fire. Progress was made on firebreaks, with 15 miles of breaks being built along Foothills and Grave Creek Roads. A helicopter helped with fire control and mop up continued. On August 24, the fire made a \\"major run\\" according to the U.S. Forest Service, heading north and east by strong winds. It grew 1,500 acres towards Mount Scotty, marking in total land burned. To combat the fire's growth, crews implemented group and individual tree torching and cleaned up brush to improve fuel breaks. Helicopters continued to drop water to stop spot fires and water pumps were installed to protect historic bridges in the area. The number of personnel fighting the fire was cut back, due to resources, to 87 on August 27. September By September 1, the Gibralter Fire had grown to and was 27% contained, with 38 fire personnel fighting the fire. Rain helped moderate fire activity and mop up continued. The fire was slowed by helicopter water drops and Wam Lookout was wrapped for fire protection and additional fire protections being implemented for private homes along Grave Creek. By September 12, the fire remained burning in Williams Creek and had moved over Locke Mountain and into Flathead National Forest. The fire had grown to . The next day, crews wrapped Ninko cabin to provide structure protection. After six weeks of fighting the fire, it had grown to in total by containment on September 20.

They repaired and rebuilt 34 miles of roads. All trailheads impacted by the fire remain closed due to falling trees and debris.

Major rebuilding was undertaken in the 15th century. A Victorian restoration was carried out in 1872 when the chancel was rebuilt. The parish is within the benefice of Pilton with Croscombe, North Wootton and Dinder which is part of the Diocese of Bath and Wells. Architecture The church consists of a three-bay nave, chancel, north aisle and a north organ chamber. The three-stage tower is supported by diagonal buttresses. Inside the church are a stone pulpit and perpendicular font and piscina. There is a stone carving of a two-headed dragon about the south chapel window. The legend of the Dragon of Dinder goes back for centuries, and is documented on illuminated transcript which is now preserved in Eton College Library Records. The legend goes that a terrible Dragon was terrorising both livestock and villagers. The then Bishop Jocelyn was called upon to save the people of Dinder. He rode out with his men at arms, but at the last furlong commanded them to remain at a distance while he rode on and single-handedly beheaded the beast.

Many of its pupils went on to make a mark on English culture and society, particularly as writers. Most famous is Jane Austen, who used the school as a model of \\"a real, honest, old-fashioned Boarding-school\\".Emma, chapter 3 Abbey School, Reading Mary Martha Sherwood George Butt, sometime Chaplain-in-Ordinary to George III, sent his only son to his great friend Richard Valpy, headmaster of Reading School. On a visit to the town in 1790, he was favourably impressed by the girls' school, and decided to send his elder daughter as parlour boarder, a cut above the ordinary boarder. Mary Butt, later known as the prolific author Mrs Sherwood, devoted two chapters of her memoirs to her schooldays in the 1790s, giving a detailed portrait of life at this long-established boarding school. Two buildings of Reading Abbey survived the Dissolution of the monasteries, the Hospitium, and the Inner Gateway. The latter, and a more modern building attached to it, housed the girls' establishment, which was thus known as the Abbey School or the Gateway School. (The Oxford Dictionary of National Biography calls it \\"Reading Ladies boarding-school\\".) It had its own garden, overlooking the open ground of abbey ruins known as the Forbury, where the boys played. The girls' school dates to before 1755, when Lydia Bell took on as assistant her sister Sarah Hackett, who later chose to call herself Mrs Latournelle, despite being English and unmarried. Bell bequeathed the school to her sister, whose skills lay more as a housekeeper than a teacher. A Miss Pitts, who was there as a parlour boarder, went on to take partnership of the school. Dr Valpy hired a French √©migr√©, formerly a diplomat, Dominique de St Quentin (often spelled without the particle, and sometimes as Quintin). St Quentin and Pitts married, and took over management of the girls' school: \\"with his knowledge and ability [they] soon raised [its] standard and prestige\\". Teachers included Francois Pierre Pictet, formerly secretary to Catherine the Great, Empress of Russia, and her connection to Voltaire. By the time the Butt sisters were there (Mary was joined the following year by her sister, later Lucy Lyttelton Cameron), the school had about 60 pupils, including three of the nine daughters of artist Philip Reinagle.T. A. B. Corley, ‚ÄòReinagle family (per. c.1760‚Äì1877)‚Äô, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 accessed 17 Nov 2016 It was expanding, from the ancient gatehouse to adjoining more modern buildings, giving the school new studies and dormitories. The girls were kept busy with rehearsals for \\"exhibitions\\" such as a play, in French, and a ball, featuring a quadrille. These performances, shared to some extent with the boys' school, were a good way to demonstrate to parents and prospective customers just what accomplishments they would be purchasing. Jane Austen was the school's most famous pupil, attending with her sister Cassandra 1785-1786. She drew on her experiences there when writing Emma: Titlepage of Emma Following the execution of Louis XVI at the end of January 1793, the Abbey School became a place of refuge for √©migr√©s such as statesman Charles Alexandre de Calonne.\\"Multitudes of the French nobility came thronging into Reading, gathering about the Abbey, some of them half living within its walls.\\" Sherwood, p107 In addition to this profligate hospitality, St Quentin gambled with Dr Valpy and the father of Mary Russell Mitford, and soon the school was forced to close.T.

The History Press, 2013. Claire Tomalin, the biographer of Jane Austen, sums up the school as a \\"harmless, slatternly place\\". Hans Place, London and Frances Arabella Rowden Portrait of Lady Caroline Lamb A couple of years later, the St Quentins opened another school, this time in the capital, at 22 Hans Place. This garden square address, in the desirable West End of London, was made possible by their former pupil Mrs Sherwood selling a novel. The St Quentins employed Frances Arabella Rowden (1774-1840?), who had been a parlour boarder with them in Reading when she was 16. Rowden's mother kept a school at Henley- on-Thames, at which Mary Wollstonecraft's sister Everina worked briefly. One source says Rowden was a governess in the household of Lord Bessborough (i.e. Frederick Ponsonby, 3rd Earl of Bessborough and his wife Harriet Spencer, whose only daughter was Lady Caroline Ponsonby, more commonly known by her married name as Lady Caroline Lamb). Rowden was an engaging teacher, with a particular enthusiasm for the theatre, and as private tutor to Mary Russell Mitford, she was able to indulge her fondness for the Kemble family of actors. Rowden was not only a poet, but, according to Mitford, \\"she had a knack of making poetesses of her pupils\\" Some of the girls she taught at the Hans Place school included the above-mentioned Caroline Ponsonby, who wrote Glenarvon following her affair with Lord Byron; the poet Letitia Elizabeth Landon (\\"L.E.L.\\"); Emma Roberts, the travel writer; Anna Maria Fielding, who published as S.C. Hall; and Rosina Doyle Wheeler, who married Edward Bulwer- Lytton and published her many novels as Rosina Bulwer Lytton.

British History Online deems it a \\"superior school\\". It was smaller than its Reading Abbey predecessor, with only 23 in the household, and this would have included live-in servants. In 1809 St Quentin retired and Rowden took over 22 Hans Place. Curiously, Jane Austen's brother Henry moved into number 23 in 1814, so on her visits to London, she stayed next door to her old school. \\"L.E.L.\\" was born at number 25 in 1802, and after attending school at number 22 as a small child, ended up lodging in a room on the top floor between 1826 and 1837. By that point the house had been taken by two Misses Lance, who also ran it as a school. Much later, 22 Hans Place formed the headquarters of the 1921 Irish Treaty delegation. Another innovative educational establishment, Hill House School, has been based in Hans Place since 1951. Paris Fanny Kemble as a young girl In 1798 St Quentin filed an affidavit \\"concerning denization\\", a relatively straightforward way, now obsolete, of gaining what we would call permanent residency. With the renewed peace, the St Quentins decided to try a Parisian retirement. Rowden followed in 1818 and opened a school at various locations. She had as her final notable pupil Frances (Fanny) Kemble, of the acting family. Kemble mocked the literature that Rowden deemed suitable. St Quentin was widowed, and in 1825 he and Rowden married. She would have been about 50, and he, 75. It is not known what happened to them afterwards.

It was commissioned by the British government to address a perceived compensation culture. The report made a number of recommendations to reduce bureaucracy over risk assessment requirements and to improve accountability of decisions made on health and safety grounds by local authorities. Young also recommended reform in the legal processes for personal injury claims and for limits to be placed on claims management companies.  Background  Common Sense, Common Safety was commissioned from David Young, Baron Young of Graffham by the British government and published in October 2010. It was an attempt by the government to address a perceived compensation culture in the United Kingdom. The British government of this period has been described as being pre-occupied with this matter and had previously implemented measures such as the Compensation Act 2006 to address it. The media of this period were criticised for over-sensationalising events and activities that had been banned on health and safety grounds. Young's report cited a number examples of \\"health and safety hysteria in the media\\" including a report that claimed police officers had been prevented from diving into water to try to save drowning persons and a circus clown who, it was claimed, was banned from wearing oversized shoes during his act.  Findings  Young made a series of recommendations that attempted to make sure health and safety was taken seriously whilst minimising the burden placed on small businesses. He recommended that the risk assessment process be simplified for low-hazard workplaces such as offices and shops and that the Health and Safety Executive make available a template to be used by such employers. He also recommended that many self-employed persons, working in low-hazard environments, and those that work from home be exempted from the requirement to carry out risk assessments. Young also recommended that a standardised level of qualification was required for people practising as health and safety consultants and that a register be kept of such persons. He requested that insurance companies cease to specify that a consultant be employed to carry out a risk assessment in low-hazard workplaces. He made a number of recommendations for the educational sector as he thought the current process was too complicated and deterred teachers from taking children on trips out of school. He recommended that schools move away from risk assessments to risk-benefit assessments that take into account the benefits provided by play and leisure activities. To address local authorities banning events on health and safety grounds Young recommended that they be required to record their specific reasons in writing and that they carry out an internal review of all such decisions. The report also recommended that a process be instituted by which citizens could refer decisions made by local authorities to an ombudsman who would review the decision within a fortnight. In the legal field Young called for a simpler claims procedure to be implemented for personal injury (and possibly low-value medical negligence) claims, similar to one previously introduced to deal with road traffic claims. He also recommended that Lord Justice Rupert Jackson's Review of Civil Litigation Costs be implemented in full. Young requested that the work of claims management companies and referral agencies be restricted and the quantity of their advertisements limited. He also recommended that the government issue formal clarification that people will not be held responsible for the consequences of any well-intentioned actions.  Impact  David Cameron, British prime minister in 2010 The report received media attention after its publication and recently elected prime minister David Cameron stated that his cabinet accepted all of Young's recommendations. Construction union, UCATT, criticised Young for \\"belittling workplace safety\\" in one of his addresses in the House of Lords. Young was forced to resign as government health and safety and enterprise adviser by the end of 2010 over the matter. In response to Young's report the Health and Safety Executive set up a working group to spearhead the implementation of the report's recommendations for the education sector. David Cameron referenced the report in 2012 which he stated would be the year in which the government \\"kills off the health and safety culture for good\\". In April that year the Reporting of Injuries, Diseases and Dangerous Occurrences Regulations were amended to relax the requirement for reporting to only apply to injuries that prevented an employee from carrying out their usual work for seven days.

These include videos of a School Resource Officer in South Carolina high school dragging a student across the classroom for refusing to stop using her mobile phone, then arresting her and a fellow student for recording the incident; and an autistic 11-year-old student tackled to the ground by school security, then charged with felony assault for resisting. Numerous articles about these incidents have raised awareness of the school disturbance laws and their problems, including their broad interpretation and application, such as South Carolina's law which makes it a crime to \\"disturb school\\" or to \\"act in an obnoxious manner.\\" Studies in the early 21st century have questioned the effectiveness and fairness of the laws and their application. Several states revised their school disturbance laws to lessen the impact of the criminal justice system on students within schools.South Carolina General Assembly Bill S.131, text.

History  School Disturbance Laws have been in existence since at least as early as 1919, when a law was proposed in South Carolina, to address concerns of men flirting with students at an all-white women's college. The law prohibited any \\"obnoxious\\" behavior or \\"loiter[ing]\\" at any girls' school or college, with a penalty of up to a $100 fine or 30 days in jail. Similar laws appeared in many states along with laws to protect worship services or public meetings. In some states, they were written to ensure they applied only to non-students.This Is The Law Officers Use To Arrest Students For \\"Disturbing School\\", Buzzfeed. October 28, 2015. Retrieved 2017-12-08. During the 1960s the laws began to evolve into their current form of applying to all schools. In 1967 after African American students protested against segregation in Orangeburg, South Carolina, it was proposed to change the law to prohibit obnoxious behavior at all schools in order to \\"keep(ing) outside agitators off campus,\\" according to the bill's sponsor. Subsequent protests, including what became known as the Orangeburg Massacre where police shot 30 unarmed students and killed 3 African American teenagers, the law was signed into law. The President's Commission on Campus Unrest reported in 1970 that \\"more than 30 states had passed nearly 80 laws to counter student unrest\\". The law has since been used to permit the arrest of thousands of mostly African-American students who breach the law.‚ÄòDisturbing Schools‚Äô Law and School Resource Officers Criminalize Teens, Juvenile Justice Information Exchange.

In 1969 the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that students had a right to protest peacefully on school grounds, as long as they did so without \\"materially and substantially\\" disturbing class. Until the 1970s, it had been a common practice for \\"problem youth\\" to be \\"pushed out\\" of the educational system. By the decade of the 1970s, court decisions began to stress that all had the right to an education within the educational system. It therefore resulted in students who had been found to be delinquent \\"could no longer legally be dismissed from school on the recommendation of a teacher or an administrator\\". School counselors were then tasked with working with behavioral and emotional problems with students who previously would have been expelled or sent to reform schools.

School disturbance laws started to become integral to school discipline in the 1990s, in response to rising fears of school violence, high-profile shootings in schools (such as the Columbine High School massacre), and passage of \\"zero-tolerance laws\\" such as the Gun- Free Schools Act of 1994, following which many more police were installed in schools across the US. From the mid-1970s to 2008, the number of schools with police stationed on campus rose from approximately 1 percent to 40 percent.\\"Criminalizing Children at School, The New York Times.

In 2017 a law was proposed in South Carolina to urge educators and school administrators \\"to exhaust all avenues of behavioral discipline in accordance with the school's code of conduct prior to requesting the involvement of law enforcement officials.\\" The law was passed and signed into law on May 17, 2018.

Criticism of the laws   Vagueness and broad-scope  In several states, the school disturbance laws are not specific in defining what behavior or actions are covered, instead using far-reaching language such as \\"disorderly conduct\\", \\"disturbing a public assembly\\", or \\"act in an obnoxious behavior\\".Robin L.

Retrieved 2017-12-08. In September 1970, the President's Commission on Campus Unrest warned of \\"antistudent and antiuniversity laws that range from the unnecessary and ill-directed to the purely vindictive.\\"  Criminalization of behavior  The laws' application has led to a perception that normal adolescent misbehavior is being subjected to punishment by the criminal justice system instead of through traditional school disciplinary channels, that in some instances has rendered \\"all manner of common misbehavior illegal\\". A 2012 report on the criminalization of school discipline in Massachusetts noted that the state's \\"disturbing a lawful assembly\\" law has repeatedly been used to arrest students who act out, for bringing phones to school, swearing at school resource officers, and failing to identify themselves. The increased application of the school disturbance laws have parallel the use of law enforcement officials as school resource officers based in schools. According to a 2017 analysis of 2,650 schools published in the Washington University Law Review, students at schools with police officers were significantly more likely to be reported to law enforcement for low-level offenses than students at schools without police, even after controlling for the neighborhood crime rate, the demographics of the schools, and a host of other variables. Most law-enforcement officials are trained to address adult criminal behavior, to assert authority, and to take control of a situation. That often have limited training or understanding of issues of child development and psychology. As a result, the way they address student behavioral issues can have a detrimental effect on the student population and school as a whole.\\" Some notable recent examples: * In 2011, a 13-year-old student in New Mexico was arrested for repeatedly fake-burping in class. The courts ruled that \\"burping, laughing, and leaning into the classroom stopped the flow of student educational activities, thereby injecting disorder into the learning environment.\\"Burping student gets no legal relief from appeals court, Albuquerque Journal.

According to a University of Chicago analysis, African-American students are less likely to commit offenses worthy of expulsion or arrest.School Discipline at a Crossroads: From Zero Tolerance to Early Response, Exceptional Children, Vol.66, No.3, pp335-347. 2000.

Diverting resources  Some groups have expressed concern that the hiring of law enforcement officials to enforce routine discipline has taken resources away from student support services such as counselors, social workers, and others who are better equipped to address some of the behavioral issues before they escalate to needing police intervention.  Effectiveness of the laws  Recent studies and developments have concluded that the presence in schools of law enforcement officers, in particular those ones who use arrest to address issues of student discipline, do not make schools safer. A 2011 report by the Consortium on Chicago School Research at the University of Chicago, found that school safety is promoted more by the kind of relationships police forge with teachers and students than the number of arrests they make.\\"Student and Teacher Safety in Chicago Public School, Steinberg, Allensworth, Johnson.

Early life and family He was born in Montpellier to Th√©r√®se Salettes and √âtienne B√©rard, the latter a scientist and chemical manufacturer (particularly of sulphuric acid). B√©rard senior worked with Jean-Antoine Chaptal, Count of Chanteloup, who was a chemist, industrialist, politician and an acquaintance of another French chemist, Claude Louis Berthollet. Through this connection, his son was recommended as Berthollet's laboratory assistant. He married Madeleine Ana√Øs Combres in 1829. They had three children, St√©phanie Fran√ßoise Amica, Henri √âtienne and Raoul. Career As an assistant from 1807, B√©rard became a member of the Soci√©t√© d'Arcueil, a group of like-minds who met regularly at the homes of Berthollet at Arcueil, near Paris; he was able to frequent with many experienced and well-known scientists. His first published scientific work was in analysing salts and solubilities. He completed bachelor of arts and bachelor of science degrees at the University of Paris in 1811. The same year, his experiments with Fran√ßois-√âtienne de La Roche won the prize of the First Class of the University, for determining the specific heat of gases using a copper calorimeter. He worked with √âtienne-Louis Malus on polarization (of infrared and ultraviolet), which Malus later became famous for. He provided the density of nitric oxide which Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac utilised as a datum for his law of combining volumes He departed for l'√âcole Sup√©rieure de Pharmacie de Montpellier in 1813. He was elected to l'Acad√©mie des Sciences of France in the chemistry section on 20 December 1819. The Acad√©mie des Sciences awarded him a prize for his pioneering study of the ripening of fruit in 1821, after he tested different atmospheres on harvested fruits. Understanding that fruits ripen in an atmosphere with oxygen, and release carbon dioxide, he suggested sealing fruits in jars with an oxygen absorber. He became professor of mineral chemistry at l'√âcole Sup√©rieure de Pharmacie in Montpellier in 1827. In the same city, he also became Dean of the Faculty of Medicine at l'Acad√©mie des Sciences et Lettres, a position he held from 1847 to 1869. He researched many topics, including lime used in winemaking and chemicals in mineral water. B√©rard was the first professor of toxicology at Montpellier. He was a pioneer in chemical engineering, including pharmaceuticals, and was managing director of La Paille, the manufacturing site that had been founded by Chaptal in 1782.

In 20th century India, many great personalities walked in multifaceted fields of Indian society. Many amongst them served the nation in different capacities through various occupations. Some of them contributed immensely in the field of education all over India. Gokhale was amongst such personalities who worked all his life for women education and welfare.  Early life  Anant Ramachandra Gokhale, popularly known as A.R. Gokhale or Nanasaheb was born in Ichalkaranji, then a small state (now in Kolhapur District) of Maharashtra in a Chitpavan Brahmin family. His parents Ramachandra Vishnu Gokhale, himself a Sanskrit scholar and Mathurabai played an important role in ensuring higher education for their son. Anant Ramachandra Gokhale spent his early life in Belgaum, Karnataka. He finished his high school education from Beynon Smith High School Belgaum which was run by the missionaries. After matriculation, he studied in Willingdon College Sangli and graduated from Rajaram College Kolhapur in the year 1927. He also did his M.A. in English and Sanskrit from Deccan College Pune and B.T. from Tilak College of Education, Pune. Anant Ramachandra Gokhale started his life as school teacher in American Missionary School, Vengurla where he came across Dr. Robert H. H. Goheen, an American academic who was known for his selfless service and simple living with high thinking. Dr. Goheen's son Robert F. Goheen went on to become the president of Princeton University and United States Ambassador to India. Gokhale also worked with the New English High School Satara. A.R.Gokhale was associated with the Servants of India Society, formed by Namdar Gopal Krishna Gokhale. A.R.Gokhale was involved in the activities of Bharat Sevak Samaj, founded by India's first Prime Minister Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru. He was also a member of Maharashtra Samajik Parishad.  Servants of India Society  Anant Ramachandra Gokhale's life took a new turn in the 1930s when he was influenced by the preachings of great scholar of mathematics and leader Namdar Gopal Krishna Gokhale and joined the Servants of India Society which was founded by him in Pune. The Servants of India Society was running an English Daily The Hitavada since 1911. With his flair for journalism and great command over English, Marathi and Sanskrit, Gokhale went on deputation to Delhi in early 1930s as a special correspondent for the newspaper and covered the proceedings of Central Legislative Assembly (Now known as Lok Sabha). He had a great opportunity to closely observe and meet leaders like Pandit Motilal Nehru, Barrister Muhammad Ali Jinnah who then represented the Indian National Congress, Vithalbhai Patel, the co-founder of Swaraj Party, Barrister M. R. Jayakar of Pune who was a founder of Pune Vidyapeeth, and several other leaders. Thus his life was enriched by a spell of journalism.  Influence of Women's Education  A.R. Gokhale, during his college days in the 1920s was highly influenced by great personalities like Maharshi Dhondo Keshav Karve who had started Hingne Stree Shikshan Sanstha for destitute and child widows who lived life of Alawan. The institute grew up to become Shreemati Nathibai Damodar Thackersey Women's University. Thus the tradition of women's emancipation from slavery flourished in Maharashtra. Another pioneer of women education Ramabai Ranade, wife of Justice Mahadev Govind Ranade of Bombay High Court had founded Pune Sevasadan Society in Pune in the 1909 for poor and destitute child widows to make them self-reliant and independent through education. Her contemporary, Pandita Ramabai was also a fountainhead of women's liberation. The women in the Central Provinces and Berar had a similar fate like rest of Maharashtra. In Nagpur, then the capital of Central Provinces and Berar, eminent people like Bhawani Shankar Niyogi, who later became the Chief Justice of Nagpur High Court, Justice W. R. Puranik of Nagpur High Court and Colonel K. V. Kukade and their friends were impressed by the work of Pune Sevasadan Society and the Nagpur branch of Pune Sevasadan came into existence on 2 January 1927 with G. B. Garud as Nagpur Sevasadan's first Superintendent. He served there till 1936. In the year 1936, A.R. Gokhale, concluded his tenure with The Hitavada and moved to Nagpur along with his wife Mrs. Sushilabai Gokhale, herself a Fergusson College, Pune graduate, to follow his ideals and there began a long journey with Sevasdan Nagpur.  Sevasadan Education Society  Anant Ramchnadra Gokhale's life turned a new corner to devote 40 years of life to women's education in 1936. Pune Sevasadan was looking for a young graduate couple in those days and had plans to take Nagpur Sevasadan forward. Gokhale and his wife Sushilabai Gokhale, both of whom were English, Marathi and Sanskrit scholars and orators was an apt couple to take over the reins and nurture Nagpur Sevasadan. Thus A.R.Gokhale became the superintendent of Sevasadan at a young age of 29. He was a teacher of English in high school for the 9th, 10th and 11th standards. Though he was the Superintendent of the school and was devoted to other aspects like school administration, fund raising for construction of buildings, he was also teaching English to female students of the school. Gokhale took keen interest in the administration and also laid foundation of fledgling Sevasadan into a bigger institution. Nagpur Sevasadan had begun its journey in a rented bungalow in Dhantoli. He always wanted Sevasadan to move into a large premises and was in real sense a creator of converting this dream into reality for the benefit of destitute women and girls. He was continuously talking to the then Central Provinces and Berar Government and secured a plot for the school from them in the year 1939. Sevasadan shifted to its new building in 1940. His work did not stop only at the creation of one building, but he was toiling hard for the betterment of women's education and erected buildings for a High School, Pre-Primary Teachers Training College and Women's Hostel to bring Nagpur Sevasadan to its current status. In those days, women in India were dependent on their families for survival because they were uneducated. The child widows had no choice to remarry and had to work for well-to-do families with a meagre income and no future, thus being exploited by the society as they were poor and uneducated. Their condition was pitiable, so it was necessary to make them educated and self-supportive. Nagpur Sevasadan gave them shelter in its women's hostel. Gokhale started many schemes in the society for their welfare. He brought in the concept of 'Earn and Learn' for these women so they could live their lives with respect in the society. The women who could not afford education and had no place to stay were accommodated in the women's hostel allowing them to work for the school and paid for the work done by them and also take up education and attend classes in the school or in the training colleges of Sevasadan. Gokhale was a well known figure in Nagpur as a social worker and educator. During those days, the girl students hailing from Hyderabad State appeared for S.S.C examination of Nagpur Board and used to come to Nagpur for examinations in the summer. The poor girls had no accommodations for short period of 2 months. Gokhale ensured the girl students were allowed to stay in Sevasadan Hostel and helping them. Similarly, girls from refugee families who migrated from Pakistan were supported by him for taking up the exam in Nagpur, making facilities available for those students in the premises of Nagpur Sevasadan. For him, he preached what he taught ensuring equality among all his students irrespective of caste, creed and religion. During the 1950s, there were no trained teachers for Balak Mandirs (Children School). So Gokhale and his wife started a Pre-Primary Teachers Training College for women and Mrs. Gokhale as its Principal helped the institute to bring out qualified teachers. Gokhale was a founder President of Superintendents‚Äô Association (now known as Headmasters' Association) in the 1940s for safeguarding the interests of the institutions. He was the President again in the early 1970s. Through his tireless efforts, construction of a hall for the Association's office and meetings came into a reality at Laxmi Nagar, Nagpur. Gokhale breathed Sevasadan all through his life and developed the institute for women's education and their welfare.  End of an Era  Gokhale believed in the maxim of ‚ÄòHigh Thinking and Simple Living‚Äô and he lived all his life as per his ideals. He breathed his last in Sevasadan on 25 June 1978 at the age of 71. He dedicated his life to Sevasadan. Such devoted servants of society are rare to find in new set. Nagpur Sevasadan celebrated Mr. A.R. Gokhale's birth centenary year in 2006‚Äì2007 and installed his statue in the premises of Nagpur Sevasadan as a mark of respect and a book \\"Kai. A.Ra.Gokhale Smrutigandh\\", Publisher Dr.Kshama Limaye, 2006-07 was published in his memory on the same occasion.

It is a parasite of the larva of the winter moth (Operophtera brumata), and has been used in biological pest control to control this moth, whose larvae feed on foliage and defoliate trees. Ecology Agrypon flaveolatum is native to Europe and Asia where it is a parasitoid of geometrid moths. When the winter moth (Operophtera brumata) was accidentally introduced into Nova Scotia, Canada, in the 1920s, it caused the damage and death of many native trees by defoliation. In 1949 it was declared to be an invasive pest species and six species of parasitic insects were imported from Europe in an attempt to control it. Two of these insects became established in Nova Scotia, the fly Cyzenis albicans as well as A. flaveolatum. Although they were unable to prevent the winter moth from spreading to other areas, they are likely to accompany their host to new locations and may reduce the rate at which it spreads. In 1954, in a study area, each tree was associated with more than a thousand adult winter moths, but by 1963, fewer than one moth per tree was present, a good example of classical biological control. Another outbreak of winter moths occurred on Vancouver Island in British Columbia, Canada, where it was accompanied by the bruce spanworm (Operophtera bruceata). Here, at high densities the winter moth was controlled by the fly and the parasitoid wasp, but at low densities, a more important factor seems to have been the native beetles that ate the moth pupae. When an outbreak of winter moths occurred in the US state of Massachusetts in the first decade of the 21st century, the fly was the biological control of choice because it was feared that the wasp might parasitise other geometrid moths, of which there were about a dozen rare species in the state.

She worked closely with her son William and her daughter Mary Katherine, who both also became printers and publishers, forming one of the earliest influential publishing dynasties in the American colonies. Early years and education Sarah Updike was born at Cocumscussuc, Rhode Island, just north of the village of Wickford, where her parents, Lodowick Updike (anglicized from Opdyck) and Abigail (Newton) Updike, had inherited Smith's Castle, the original site of Roger Williams' trading post. Sarah was one of six children; her brother Daniel would go on to serve as attorney general of the Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations. She was well educated, studying French and Latin in addition to more usual subjects. Career In 1735, she married Giles Goddard, a well-to-do physician, and they settled in New London, Connecticut. Giles Goddard was also the postmaster in New London, and when he fell ill in 1755, Sarah served as postmaster in his place. Both of their surviving children ‚Äî Mary Katherine and William ‚Äî became involved in the printing and publishing businesses. Providence Gazette and Country Journal of Nov. 20, 1762. Sometime after Giles's death in 1757, Sarah moved to Providence, Rhode Island, where in 1762 she financed her son William to set up Providence's first print shop and an associated weekly newspaper, the Providence Gazette and Country Journal. Both Sarah and her daughter Mary Katherine worked in the shop and developed into accomplished printers alongside head printer John Carter, who had apprenticed with Benjamin Franklin. In 1765, due to a lack of subscribers, William suspended publication of the Providence Gazette and moved away. Sarah took over management of the print shop with the help of Mary Katherine and issued broadsides and pamphlets as well as the annual West's Almanack under the imprint \\"S. & W. Goddard\\". In 1766, she revived the Providence Gazette with \\"Sarah Goddard & Company\\" as the publisher. That same year, she printed the first American edition of the letters of the essayist and poet Lady Mary Wortley Montagu. She added a bookstore and bindery to her operation before selling the business in 1768 to John Carter. Goddard and Mary Katherine then moved to Philadelphia, where William had launched a new paper, the Pennsylvania Chronicle and Universal Advertiser. This paper had run into trouble due to William's erratic management and many absences. Goddard took over management of the paper and provided financial support, which allowed the Chronicle to survive. However, she died within a year of the move, leaving her daughter as the paper's manager. A contemporary obituary praised Goddard for her \\"uncommon attainments in literature\\" and her \\"sensible and edifying conversation\\". In 1998, Goddard was inducted into the Rhode Island Heritage Hall of Fame.

At that time the band members were Rumon (guitar and vocals), Shubho (drums), Tito (keyboards), with others were the first members of that band. The band was a major hit in the city of Rajshahi, frequently doing live shows in and around the city. History  Formation (1997-2000)  By the end of 1997, Shubho left the band & had to shift to Dhaka with family. The band got stuck. In 1999, Benson & Hedges Star Search Contest was launched. After receiving the application form as a surprise from Rumon's elder brother in Dhaka, Tito & himself started planning how to go about it. By the time, Rumon & Tito were the left alone members only as all others had quit the band. Shubho was recontacted and Dr. Rubel was being approached as Bassist. He readily accepted. The band was reformed and got into the final fifteen (15) in B&H; Star Search Contest consecutively in 1999 & 2000\\\\. However, the members got busy with studies and it broke down again by the end of 2000.  Main career (2002-2009)  In 2002, Rumon, inspired by Tito, participated as a solo contestant in the B&H; Star Search 2002. This time, Rumon won two awards (Best Solo Performer & Best Lyricist) for the first time in the history of the much evaluated musical talent hunt competition ever! With Shubho on Drums again & Raja on Bass, Rumon & Tito completed the set of musicians on stage for that win. Right after the awards, Rumon proposed to reform the band with a new name, rather than going solo. This is when PARTHIBO was born. With the earlier four of Rumon, Tito, Raja & Shubho; an additional guitarist was taken in- Sohel. Time moved on and PARTHIBO steadily grew in shows in Dhaka, doing concerts almost everywhere with the bigger bands. They also participated in the biggest ever concert in the countries history- 'Ampfest' and also in prestigious events like 'Ampart', 'Close Up Juke Box', Fantasy Kingdom Live Concerts etc. The first single of the band- 'Olpo Ektu Akash' featured in the hit album in 2004- 'Swapnochura'. After their first full album, 'Baundule' got released in 2005, the band was well hailed by the critics and a few of their songs i.e. 'Baundule', 'Grohon', 'Nijhum Raate', 'Olpo Ektu Akash' became quite popular. PARTHIBO won the award of 'Best Band Album' for 'Baundule' in Citycell-Channel I Music Awards 2005 competing with much bigger & famous names. Meanwhile, PARTHIBO's presence & popularity in the party scene (Parties with English Cover Nos) grew geometrically. They were hitting the floors in embassies, clubs, hotels frequently. This is when the band also got focused into the party scene and from 2006 till 2011, the band was almost completely into the party scene. By this time, Tito had left the band in 2007 for personal reasons and Nabil took his place. also there have been an inclusion of a female artist into the band keeping in mind the requirement of the party sector. Shehrina Kamal, been the first one in 2005. She was with the band till 2008 till she had to leave the country. Neda Shakiba joined in and continued till 2011. During this time, PARTHIBO was everywhere in the Party Scene. They also crossed the border and performed at 'Calcutta Rowing Club' in 2009.  Outgrowth (2011-present)  276px In 2011, the band released their second album 'Utshorgo Nijeke'. After this, a major nonnegotiable issue was confronted within the band on the future direction as well as musical taste and Nabil & Neda departed. Rony joined in 2011 with a fresh air into the band and the band found 'just the person' they were looking for in him. With his well known musical capabilities, he has contributed a lot in a significant improvement in the band's overall sound. Later, Raja left the band in 2013 and John Sutton Munshi came in his place as a guest bassist. The band ever since has been like a family and built up a greater respect within the music industry. PARTHIBO's search for a permanent bassist ended when MG Kibria joined the band in the first quarter of 2016. His groovy playing with Technical expertise on the recordings has given the band the much needed thrust to produce their own songs. Rauma has usually been the female voice as a guest vocal when needed. Parthibo launched their third album, Parthibo The Definitive Album, on 25 June 2014. The dual CD album contains 10 rearranged hits from their past albums and 10 brand new songs. In 2016, PARTHIBO released their fourth album- 'Swagoto Bangladeshe' - an album dedicated to the motherland- Bangladesh. This album is a beautiful portrait of this country covering it's tourism, rich history, festivals, even sports! An album that will make any Bangladeshi feel proud. PARTHIBO vows to continue its flow of good music in the coming days!

All 33 seats in the City Council were up for election. The election was held simultaneously with regional elections in thirteen autonomous communities and local elections all throughout Spain. Electoral system The City Council of Seville () was the top-tier administrative and governing body of the municipality of Seville, composed of the mayor, the government council and the elected plenary assembly. Elections to the local councils in Spain were fixed for the fourth Sunday of May every four years. Voting for the local assembly was on the basis of universal suffrage, which comprised all nationals over eighteen, registered and residing in the municipality of Seville and in full enjoyment of their political rights, as well as resident non-national European citizens and those whose country of origin allowed Spanish nationals to vote in their own elections by virtue of a treaty. Local councillors were elected using the D'Hondt method and a closed list proportional representation, with a threshold of five percent of valid votes‚Äîwhich included blank ballots‚Äîbeing applied in each local council. Parties not reaching the threshold were not taken into consideration for seat distribution. Councillors were allocated to municipal councils based on the following scale: {  style=\\"text- align:left; font-size:95%;\\" - bgcolor=\\"#E9E9E9\\" align=\\"center\\" ! width=\\"120\\" Population ! width=\\"265\\" Councillors -  <100  3 -  101‚Äì250  5 -  251‚Äì1,000  7 -  1,001‚Äì2,000  9 -  2,001‚Äì5,000  11 -  5,001‚Äì10,000  13 -  10,001‚Äì20,000  17 -  20,001‚Äì50,000  21 -  50,001‚Äì100,000  25 -  >100,001  +1 per each 100,000 inhabitants or fraction +1 if total is an even number } The mayor was indirectly elected by the plenary assembly. A legal clause required that mayoral candidates earned the vote of an absolute majority of councillors, or else the candidate of the most-voted party in the assembly was to be automatically appointed to the post. In the event of a tie, a toss-up would determine the appointee. The electoral law allowed for parties and federations registered in the interior ministry, coalitions and groupings of electors to present lists of candidates. Parties and federations intending to form a coalition ahead of an election were required to inform the relevant Electoral Commission within ten days of the election call, whereas groupings of electors needed to secure the signature of a determined amount of the electors registered in the municipality for which they were seeking election, disallowing electors from signing for more than one list of candidates. For the case of Seville, as its population was between 300,001 and 1,000,000, at least 5,000 signatures were required.

It is one of the earliest attempts to deploy blockchain technology for recreation and leisure.Cryptokitties Analysis Paper \\"The Leisures of Blockchains.\\" Information Systems & Economics eJournal, Social Science Research Network (SSRN). Accessed 19 December 2017. The game's popularity in December 2017 congested the Ethereum network, causing it to reach an all-time high in number of transactions and slowing it down significantly. Background CryptoKitties operates on Ethereum's underlying blockchain network, as a non- fungible token (NFT), unique to each CryptoKitty. Each CryptoKitty is unique and owned by the user, validated through the blockchain, and its value can appreciate or depreciate based on the market. CryptoKitties cannot be replicated and cannot be transferred without the user's permission even by the game developers. Users can interact with their CryptoKitties, having the ability to buy, sell, and sire (breed) them. However, the CryptoKitty art is not on the blockchain and is instead owned by Axiom Zen. The company released some of the art under a new 'Nifty' license that lets players use the image of their CryptoKitty in a limited way. A test version of CryptoKitties was unveiled at ETH Waterloo on October 19, 2017, an Ethereum hackathon. As of December 2, 2017, Genesis, the first and highest selling cat was sold for ETH246.9255 (~US$117,712) on that day. The virtual cats are breedable and carry a unique number and 256 bit distinct genome with DNA and different attributes (cattributes) that can be passed to offspring. Several traits can be passed down from the parents to the offspring. There are a total of 12 'cattributes' for any cat, including pattern, mouth shape, fur, eye shape, base color, accent color, highlight color, eye color, and optional wild, environment, 'purrstige' and 'secret'. Other features like cool down times are not passed down but are instead a function of the 'generation' of the offspring, which is one higher than the maximum generation between the two parents. In December 2017 a CryptoKitty sold for $100,000. On March 20, 2018, it was announced that CryptoKitties would be spun off into its own company, Dapper Labs, and raised $12 million from several top venture capital firms and angel investors. The investment round was led by New York based Union Square Ventures and San Francisco based Andreessen Horowitz. On May 12, 2018, a CryptoKitty was sold for $140,000. In May 2018, CryptoKitties launched their first celebrity-branded CryptoKitty with Stephen Curry, an American professional basketball player. As part of the partnership, Curry was given three CryptoKitties with special imagery, the first of which he put up for auction. The company later suspended the auction, claiming that Stephen Curry was not as involved as they initially thought. The company was later sued for trade secret theft over the Stephen Curry collectibles. The court ruled in the company's favour, stating that \\"[t]he evidence demonstrates that Defendant, not Plaintiff, developed the idea to license digital collectibles using the likeness of celebrities first‚Ä¶\\". In October 2018, CryptoKitties reached the milestone of 1 million cats being bred with a volume of 3.2 million transactions on its smart contracts. In November 2018, Dapper Labs, which was spun out of Axiom Zen as the developer of CryptoKitties, raised an additional $15 million in a venture round led by Venrock. The company doubled its valuation in this round. In 2018, CryptoKitties was used by the German museum ZKM Center for Art and Media Karlsruhe to showcase blockchain technology.  Technology  A CryptoKitty's ownership is tracked via a smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain. Each CryptoKitty is represented as a non-fungible token using the ERC-721 token standard on Ethereum. Generation 0 CryptoKitties were sold to players in an auction at the rate of one every 15 minutes (672 per week) for one year. New CryptoKitties are created by breeding existing CryptoKitties. Based on the limited number of cats going into circulation and their limited genomes, there is a limit of around 4 billion total cats that can be bred. Each cat has a distinct visual appearance (\\"phenotype\\") determined by its immutable genes (\\"genotype\\") stored in the smart contract. Because cats are tokens on a blockchain, they can be bought, sold, or transferred digitally, with strong guarantees of ownership. A CryptoKitty does not have a permanently assigned gender. While they can only engage in one breeding session at one time, each cat is able to act as either matron or sire. There is a 'cooldown' time that indicates how soon the cat can breed again, which goes up with the number of breeds, capped at one week. Axiom Zen developed the game. Until November 2018, Axiom Zen intended to continually release a new CryptoKitty every 15 minutes, with the rest of supply determined by breeding of CryptoKitties. CryptoKitty owners may put them up for sale via an auction for a price set in Ether (ETH). They could also put them up for sire, where another player can pay to breed with a specific CryptoKitty.  Reception  Shortly after launch, there were concerns that CryptoKitties was crowding out more serious, significant businesses that use the Ethereum platform. The game caused an increase in pending transactions on Ethereum, and at one point accounted for over 10% of network traffic on Ethereum. Ethereum miners increased the gas limit in response to CryptoKitties, which allowed for more data per block and increasing transactions per second. A variety of similar websites such as Etheremon, Ethertulips, and CryptoBots, were also created. Marketplace sites such as OpenSea and RareBits were also created as a response.

He received state and national accolades, including being recognized as a member of the first generation of bluegrass musicians by the Bluegrass Music Hall of Fame and Museum in Kentucky.  Biography  Hawkes was born in Providence, Rhode Island but moved back to his family's homestead in Westbrook, Maine when he was 10, in 1941. His father helped him get hooked on southern hillbilly music by installing a radio with a long antenna that could pick up music from stations like WWVA, WCKY, WJJD, and, WBT. When he was thirteen, Hawkes's mother bought him a guitar and chord book, and his father soon gave him a Gibson A4 mandolin. Hawkes formed his first band (Al Hawkes Hillbillies) as a high school sophomore. They played at local school functions and grange halls. In the late 1940s Hawkes built a pirate radio station broadcasting at 1210KC on the AM dial, which he shut down in 1949 after the FCC learned of his illegal operation. He was soon was broadcasting five days a week from WLAM radio in Lewiston, Maine. In the 1940s Hawkes performed as one half of the duo Allerton & Alton, the first interracial duo to play bluegrass. They performed live and on radio shows until 1951, despite the heavily segregated climate of the time. In 1951, during the Korean War, Hawkes entered the Maine National Guard and was stationed in North Africa, where he was a disc jockey for Armed Forces Radio and performed for the troops. Here he had the opportunity to learn how to use up-to-date recording equipment. When he returned from North Africa, he went to Boston to the Massachusetts Radio and Broadcast School for two years, obtained his First Class Broadcast License, and graduated as an honor student. In 1956 Hawkes formed Event Records, an independent label out of Westbrook, Maine with Richard Greeley. Together they recorded many high- profile artists including Dick Curless, Hal Lone Pine, Charlie Bailey, Lenny Breau, and Curtis Johnson. Event Records operated until 1962 when the warehouse of its Boston distributor was destroyed by a fire and thousands of records were lost, putting the company out of business. In 2010 Andrew Jawitz made a 47-minute documentary, The Eventful Life of Al Hawkes, which was broadcast on the Maine Public Broadcasting Network and shown locally. In 2013 Todd Hutchisen of Acadia Recording Company (a small recording studio in Portland, Maine) purchased all of the original recording equipment from Event Records and relocated and repaired the 1/4‚Äù mono tape decks, Altec stereo mixing board, Ampex 350s, real tape delay, spring reverb, and original RCA, Shure and EV microphones for use at Acadia. That equipment has been used to record several split 45 vinyl records with groups looking to recreate the iconic rockabilly sound. After Event Records, Hawkes opened a TV repair shop at the same site as his recording studio. Its sign is now eligible for the National Register of Historic Places. After his 80th birthday, then-Senator Olympia Snowe delivered a tribute to him in the Congressional Record, calling Hawkes \\"a Maine and national treasure.\\" Hawkes died on December 28, 2018 at the age of 88.

History  It expanded into the field of system integration for small businesses, predominantly involving the design, deployment and maintenance of LAN solutions deploying Ethernet networking technologies. This gave them a platform to specialise in Ethernet network technology. By 2005, the business focus was changed to networking technologies and associated services. The company signed a contract with the Malaysian state of Malacca to implement a statewide wireless network project linking all government offices and facilities within the state of Malacca. This project was successfully launched on 3 October 2002 by the then Chief Minister of the State of Malacca, Datuk Seri Haji Mohd Ali Bin Mohd Rustam.  Growth  The company began in 2004 to build Malaysia‚Äôs first carrier class Metro Ethernet fiber optic border-to- border network spanning Peninsular Malaysia. Through a partnership with Fiberail Sdn Bhd, a subsidiary of Telecom Malaysia Berhad, which had deployed fiber optic cable along various of Malaysia‚Äôs railways and pipelines, the Group capitalised on this existing network of unutilized dark fiber running from Padang Besar on the Thailand-Malaysia border to Johor Bahru on the Singapore-Malaysia border. Through various tech partnerships, the Group installed its current network switching technology and, following huge investment, the first phase of this nationwide Metro Ethernet network was completed and commissioned in December 2006. The company also installed its NOC in Kuala Lumpur at this time and network services to customers commenced in March 2007.

In a racing career which lasted from May 1991 until October 1992 she ran fourteen times in four different countries and won three races. As a juvenile in 1991 she finished second in the Princess Margaret Stakes before recording her biggest win in the Group 1 Moyglare Stud Stakes. As a three-year-old she struggled for form early in the year but did much better when switched to sprint races, winning the Prix de Meautry as well as being placed in the Prix Maurice de Gheest and the Goldene Peitsche. She had little success as a broodmare, producing only two minor winners. Background Twafeaj was a bay mare bred in Kentucky by Bill H Melton. In July 1990, the filly was consigned to the Keeneland Summer Select Yearling Sale at Lexington, Kentucky and was bought for $120,000 by representatives of Maktoum bin Rashid Al Maktoum's Gainsborough Stud. She was sent to Europe where she raced in the colours of the businessman Abdulla Buhaleeba and was trained by Ben Hanbury at the Diomed Stables at Newmarket, Suffolk. Her sire Topsider was just below top class as a racehorse, recording his biggest win in the Grade III Sport Page Handicap in 1978. As a breeding stallion the best of his other progeny included North Sider, Assatis (Gran Premio del Jockey Club) and Salse (Prix de la For√™t). Twafeaj's dam Billy Sue's Rib was a successful racemare in North America, winning thirteen of her twenty-two races and earning $289,635 in prize money. As a granddaughter of the American broodmare Princess Revoked (foaled 1959) she was closely related to My Juliet, Snaafi Dancer, Winona and Lyphard's Special and was a female-line descendant of Ivabel, a half-sister to the Kentucky Derby winner Old Rosebud. Racing career 1991: two-year-old season Twafeaj made her debut in a maiden race over five furlongs at Newmarket Racecourse on 3 May and finished second, beaten one and a half lengths by Marling after going to the front a furlong out but being overtaken in the closing stages. Eleven days later she started 1/2 favourite for a maiden over the same distance at York Racecourse but was beaten a head by the Mick Easterby-trained Poolesta. At the same track on 14 June the filly started favourite for a minor event over six furlongs, and recorded her first success, taking the lead inside the last quarter mile and coming home three lengths clear of her rivals despite being eased down by her jockey, Pat Eddery, in the final strides. In July was stepped up in class to contest the Group 3 Cherry Hinton Stakes at Newmarket but finished a well- beaten fourth behind Musicale, Coffee Ice and Miss Bluebird. Later that month she produced a better effort at Ascot Racecourse, finishing strongly to take second place behind the Irish-trained filly Bezelle in the Princess Margaret Stakes. On 8 September the filly was sent to Ireland to contest the Group 1 Moyglare Stud Stakes at the Curragh and started the 7/2 second favourite behind her old rival Poolesta. The best of the other six runners appeared to be Tarwiya (winner of the Listed Rochestown Stakes) but with no previous Group winners in the field the race was weakly-contested by Group 1 standards. Ridden by Bruce Raymond, Twafeaj was among the leaders from the start, went to the front approaching the final furlong and won by half a length from Tarwiya, with Poolesta a length away in third. On her final start of the year, Twafeaj contested the Group 1 Cheveley Park Stakes at Newmarket on 2 October and came home fourth of the nine runners behind Marling, beaten just over three lengths by the winner. 1992: three-year-old season Twafeaj began her second campaign in Germany when she finished unplaced in the Arag Preis over 1600 metres at D√ºsseldorf on 10 May. Her first race that year in England came two months later when she finished fourth of the seven runners behind Gusy Marlowe in the Falmouth Stakes over one mile at Newmarket. After this race she was dropped back in distance to compete in sprint races starting with the Prix Maurice de Gheest over 1300 metres at Deauville Racecourse on 2 August. Ridden by Walter Swinburn she started a 29/1 outsider but belied her starting price as she kept on well in the closing stages to take third place behind the colts Pursuit of Love and Cardoun. Seventeen days later, with Swinburn again in the saddle, the filly returned to Deauville and started the 2.2/1 favourite for the Group 3 Prix de Meautry over 1200 metres on soft ground. Her ten opponents on this occasion included Showbrook (Mill Reef Stakes), Ganges (Crit√©rium de Maisons-Laffitte, third in the 2000 Guineas), Ski Chief (Prix du Petit Couvert), Notley (Stewards' Cup) and Crack Regiment (Prix Eclipse). After racing in mid-division, Twafeaj overtook the front-running Thourios inside the last 200 metres and held off a renewed challenge from the Guy Harwood-trained colt to win by a short head. The outsider Amigo Menor came home next to complete a 1-2-3 for British-trained runners. On 2 September Twafeaj was back in Germany for the Goldene Peitsche over 1200 metres at Baden-Baden and ran much better than she had done in her previous visit to that country. Ridden by Raymond she took the lead 400 metres out and finished a length second to the five-year-old Elbio, having been overtaken in the closing stages. Later that month she started at odds of 6/1 for a strongly-contested edition of the Diadem Stakes at Ascot and finished fourth behind Wolfhound, Lochsong and Montendre. On her final start, Twafeaj was dropped back to 1000 metres for the Prix de l'Abbaye at Longchamp Racecourse on 4 October and came home seventh of the nine runners behind Mr Brooks. Breeding record At the end of her racing career, Twafeaj was retired to become a broodmare for the Gainsborough Stud. As a ten-year-old in December 1999 she was put up for auction at Tattersalls and bought for 34,000 guineas by the Barronstown Stud. She was later moved to the Pencarrow Stud in New Zealand. She produced at least nine foals and two minor winners between 1995 and 2007: *Mr Hamad, a bay colt, foaled in 1995, sired by Rainbow Quest. Failed to win in two races. *Inthaar, bay colt (later gelded), 1997, by Nashwan. Won one race. *Lulu Island, brown filly, 1998, by Zafonic.

Toconce volcano has a central crater and is constructed mainly by andesitic lava flows, which were emplaced during three different stages. The last stage generated the bulk of the volcanic edifice. The volcano was glaciated between 15,000 - 11,000 years ago and this has resulted in glacial erosion and the development of moraines above elevation. The glacial erosion has excavated a number of glacial valleys on the volcano, and hydrothermally altered rocks from inside the edifice have been exposed. Toconce volcano is constructed atop the Toconce and Sifon ignimbrites. These ignimbrites belong to a dacite-rhyolite ignimbrite sequence which many volcanoes in the Central Andes are constructed on. The ignimbrite sequences together with the stratovolcanoes form the volcanic arc in the Central Andes, which here constitutes the Central Volcanic Zone. The relatively small Tolar ignimbrite was erupted from Toconce volcano, over 1.3 million years ago. The San Pedro-Linzor chain of volcanoes is a chain of volcanoes of late Pleistocene-Holocene age that is parallel to several other chains of volcanoes in the region but perpendicular to the main volcanic arc. Aside from Toconce, it includes San Pedro, San Pablo, Paniri, Cerro del Le√≥n and Linzor, covering a length of . One sample from Toconce has been dated to 1.1 ¬± 0.1 million years before present. These volcanoes are composed by pyroclastics and scoria as well as lava domes and lava flows and are mostly andesitic; however the entire spectrum of lavas from basaltic andesite to dacite can be encountered there. The rocks at Toconce are formed primarily by plagioclase and glass, with amphibole, biotite, pyroxene and quartz making up the rest. The volcanic sequence belongs to the potassium rich calc-alkaline series. Hydrothermal alteration has given rise to clay, oxidation products and sericite. Obsidian was quarried on the mountain.

He later served as the 9th Superintendent of the Virginia Military Institute. Early career Shell was born on October 20, 1908, in Phoebus in Virginia, and later attended high school in Hampton. During the summer of 1927, he entered the Virginia Military Institute in Lexington, and graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in electrical engineering in June 1931. Shell was commissioned a second lieutenant in the Marine Corps the same month and assigned for officers training to the Basic School at the Philadelphia Navy Yard. Shell finished basic training in June 1932 and spent the following months serving at the Marine Barracks in Quantico. He was transferred to San Diego, California, at the end of March 1933 and spent a year of service there. He was attached to the Marine detachment aboard the newly commissioned heavy cruiser USS Astoria in March 1934 and took part in the shake-down cruise in the Pacific Ocean with the stops at Samoa, Fiji, New Caledonia, Australia and Hawaii. While aboard that vessel, he was promoted to the rank of first lieutenant in November 1934. Detached from the USS Astoria in June 1935, Shell spent following three years of service at the Marine Corps Base San Diego and with the headquarters Department of the Pacific in San Francisco. He was promoted to the rank of captain in July 1938 and assigned to the Battery Commanders' course at Field Artillery School at Fort Sill, Oklahoma in September of that year. World War II Upon the graduation from the Field Artillery School in June 1939, Shell joined 2nd Battalion, 10th Marine Artillery Regiment under Lieutenant Colonel John B. Wilson at San Diego. He served as a battery commander and took part in exercises at San Clemente Island. Shell served with 2nd Battalion until September 1940, when he was appointed commanding officer of the Marine detachment aboard the patrol gunboat USS Charleston. He took part in cruises to Alaska and Aleutian Islands. Promoted to the rank of major in May 1942, he subsequently rejoined the 2nd Battalion, 10th Marines, as executive officer in July of that year. The 2nd Battalion had recently returned a period of service in Iceland and conducted training and preparation for combat deployment for another eight months. Meanwhile, Shell was appointed commanding officer of 2nd Battalion and led it overseas as a part of 2nd Marine Division under Major General John Marston in October 1942. They arrived at Wellington in New Zealand, on October 19 and remained there until the end of December 1942. Shell sailed for Guadalcanal at the beginning of January 1943 and took part in the final drive against Japanese forces. His battalion provided support artillery fire to the advancing Marine and United States Army units during the attack on Cape Esperance and remained in the combat area until February 19, 1943. Along with the rest of the 10th Regiment, the battalion then sailed back to New Zealand for recuperation and Shell was promoted to the rank of lieutenant colonel the next month. The 10th Marines remained in New Zealand until November 1943, when they embarked for their new mission, the landings at Tarawa Atoll in the Gilbert Islands. The main task was to capture Japanese air base, which could be used for the next advance toward the Marshall Islands. Shell and his battalion subsequently took part in the amphibious landing on Tarawa on November 23. Shell remained in command of his battalion for next several months and took part in the amphibious landing on Saipan in Mariana Islands in June 1944. He was wounded by mortar fragments during the night attack on the second day of the battle and evacuated from the island. His wounds requested special care and Shell was ordered back to the United States in July 1944. He subsequently received the Legion of Merit with Combat \\"V\\" for his leadership of the battalion in the Pacific theater and also the Purple Heart for his wounds. Shell then spent several months in Naval Hospital in San Diego.

His next assignment was at Marine Corps Schools Quantico in Virginia, where he served firstly as assistant chief of staff for operations and then as chief of staff. While at Quantico, he also served as a member of the Advanced Research Group, tasked with the development of recommendations on how the Marine air- ground task force should evolve structurally to meet the challenges of atomic warfare and new technologies such as helicopters and jet aircraft. Other members of the group were Thomas J. Coolley, John P. Condon, August Larson Joseph N. Renner, Carson A. Roberts, Samuel R. Shaw, Eustace R. Smoak, William J. Van Ryzin, and Richard G. Weede. Shell was ordered to the headquarters of Fleet Marine Force Atlantic at Norfolk, where he was appointed chief of staff under Lieutenant General Oliver P. Smith in July 1954.

Burr Island () lies immediately to the north. Ruins and monuments St. Patrick's Church Templepatrick Also called Templepatrick (Teampall Ph√°draig), its construction was traditionally attributed to Saint Patrick and his nephew Lugnad, who is credited with bringing him to Ireland by boat; it is more likely to date to the 6th or 7th century AD. Lugnad's stone The stone This stone, of Silurian grit and shaped like a rudder, bears the inscription Lia Lugnaedon Macc Limenueh (\\"Stone of Lugnad son of Limenueh\\", the latter being Patrick's sister Liamain; there are many variant readings). It is the oldest inscription in Ireland in the Latin alphabet (all earlier inscriptions are in Ogham).http://www.megalithicireland.com/Inchagoill%20Island.htm The pillar is known as 'Lugnaedon Pillar', a piece of Silurian grit stone, about two feet high with an incised cross on the north side, and two such crosses on each of the other sides. The stone bears an inscription \\"Lie Lugnaedon Macc Li Menueh\\", translated, it means \\"The stone of Lugnaedon, son of Limenueh\\", the sister of St. Patrick.

Events August The Caribou Fire was reported on August 11, 2017, at 10:51 AM, 21 miles northwest of Eureka in the Yaak Area of Kootenai National Forest. It was started by a lightning strike in the upper reaches of Caribou Creek and Robinson Mountain. It was fueled by subalpine fir timber and dead and downed spruce. Crews estimated the fire had burned by August 24, leading fire crews to begin mopping and patrolling for flare ups. The fire resulted in the forest instituting a Stage II Fire Restriction prohibiting fire, campfire and stove fire use of any kind except for those from liquid petroleum or propane. The fire's expansion towards the Canadian border launched coordination between Canadian officials and an aircraft was used to drop fire retardant. As the fire expanded , crews worked to keep the fire south of the Canadian border using air and ground resources to create fire lines. By August 28, the fire had expanded .25 miles into Canada, with 90% remaining in the U.S. Canadian fire managers launched contingency lines. The Caribou Fire continued to grow northeast, with fire lines passing into the Young J Fire area that burned in 2000. Canadian authorities named the fire burning in Canada the Linklater Fire.

The next day, the fire moved east towards Forest Road 303, threatening 400 structures and prompting mandatory orders for West Kootenai, Montana. Overnight, the fire doubled in size to , expanding four miles northeast, destroying a number of structures. On September 5, property owners who suffered damage or destruction of structures were escorted by the Lincoln County Sheriffs' Department to assess their properties. Protection measures were put in place in the Basin Creek area and pre-evacuation orders were put in place for the West Kootenai area south of Tooley Lake and Basin Creek. Upon further inspection, 10 homes and 30 outbuildings were destroyed in the West Kootenai. Crews used heavy equipment to improve fire lines around West Kootenai and firefighters patrolled homes at night from spot fires.

Specialising in prestressed concrete, he designed several bridges in Australia. Stott's work on the Hammersmith flyover brought him to the attention of the London County Council where he was appointed deputy chief engineer. He subsequently became chief engineer and was appointed Director of Highways and Transportation upon the creation of the Greater London Council. He became one of the first joint controllers at the council when the planning department became part of his remit. Stott left the council to become Director-General of the National Water Council. He was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1978 and in 1983 became a professor at King's College London. Stott wrote a 1987 report on the use of open level crossings on the rail network that led to a significant change in British Rail policy and served as president of the Institution of Civil Engineers for 1989-90.  Career  Stott was born in London on 8 August 1927. He worked as a structural engineer and by the age of 28 was made a partner in the firm of Guy Maunsell. Stott was an expert in the use of prestressed concrete and designed the Kings Avenue Bridges in Canberra, Gladesville Bridge in Sydney, Tasman Bridge near Hobart and the Narrows Bridge in Perth ‚Äì all in Australia. After he completed the design of the Hammersmith flyover for London County Council (LCC) he was appointed deputy chief engineer by the LCC in 1963. Stott had particular responsibility for the council's road network before becoming chief engineer upon the death of Francis Fuller. In 1965 Stott was made Director of Highways and Transportation upon the creation of the Greater London Council. He brought in experts from the United States, offering greatly increased salaries to attract the best candidates, a system that helped increase the salaries for engineers across the UK. Stott's eight years as director saw the construction of London's first motorways and the extension of computerised control to two thirds of the city's signalised junctions. His role expanded in 1969 when he assumed control of the planning department, becoming one of the councils first joint controllers. Stott served as president of the Reinforced Concrete Association in 1964, of the Concrete Society in 1967 and of the Institute of Highway Engineers in 1971. Stott left the London Council in 1973 to take up the post of Director-General of the newly-founded National Water Council, a position he held for ten years until the body was dissolved. In this period he was also Secretary General of the International Water Supply Association. In 1978 Stott was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the Queen's Birthday Honours of 3 June. Between 1983 and 1989 Stott was Nash Professor of Civil Engineering at King's College London. Stott was commissioned by the British government to write a report into the use of open (unguarded) level crossings on the British Rail network following the Lockington rail crash in which a passenger train collided with a van on a level crossing resulting in the deaths of nine people. Stott's report was published in August 1987 and led to a significant change in British Rail policy and the installation of barriers or reduction of train speeds at 75 locations. Stott was appointed chairman of the Quality Scheme for Ready Mixed Concrete in 1989. He served three terms on the council of the Institution of Civil Engineers and was its president between November 1989 and November 1990. Stott's portrait at the institution shows the Hammersmith Flyover in the background.  Personal life  Stott married Vera Watkins in 1953 and the couple had two sons. Stott died in Truro, Cornwall, on 16 August 1993.

Repeated atelectasis and re- inflation leads to atelectotrauma. Atelectotrauma, atelectrauma, cyclic atelectasis or repeated alveolar collapse and expansion (RACE) are medical terms for the damage caused to the lung by mechanical ventilation under certain conditions. When parts of the lung collapse at the end of expiration, due to a combination of a diseased lung state and a low functional residual capacity, then reopen again on inspiration, this repeated collapsing and reopening causes shear stress which has a damaging effect on the alveolus.Shi C., Boehme S., Hartmann E. K., Markstaller K. Novel technologies to detect atelectotrauma in the injured lung. Exp Lung Res. 2011 Feb;37(1):18-25. Attar MA, Donn SM. Mechanisms of ventilator-induced lung injury in premature infants. Semin Neonatol. 2002 Oct;7(5):353-60. Clinicians attempt to reduce atelectotrauma by ensuring adequate positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) to maintain the alveoli open in expiration. This is known as open lung ventilation. High frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV) with its use of 'super CPAP' is especially effective in preventing atelectotrauma since it maintains a very high mean airway pressure (MAP), equivalent to a very high PEEP. Atelectotrauma is one of several means by which mechanical ventilation may damage the lungs leading to ventilator-associated lung injury. The other means are volutrauma, barotrauma, rheotrauma and biotrauma. Attempts have been made to combine these factors in an all encompassing term: mechanical power.

Background  The British colonies of Canada, Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick were united into one Dominion of Canada on 1 July 1867.Constitution Act, 1867, s.9 Sir John Alexander Macdonald became the first Prime Minister of the new Dominion. At the time, the Canadian government was concerned about expansionist impulses of Canada's southern neighbor, the United States, and sought to increase the population and economic prosperity of Canada to be able to reduce the associated risks. Increasing the population density and development of the Canadian West was considered a strategy for doing so, as the West was seen as a rich source of natural resources and fertile lands. Settling the West would provide new markets for the output of industrial manufacturing in the East. Encouraging immigration and the settlement of immigrants in the West was seen as one strategy for growing the West. One of the big challenges for Canada was that although a lot of people entered the country, most of them did so only in transit to the United States, so Canada did not see much settlement. The Immigration Act of 1869 was intended to encourage immigrants to settle the Canadian West, as well as re-enacting controls previously enacted by the British North American colonies. (Responsibility for legislating the controls had shifted from the former colonies to the Dominion as a result of the Canadian Confederation in 1867.)  Provisions  The Immigration Act of 1869 had provisions dealing with establishment of immigration offices, duties payable on immigrants, condition of travel and reporting requirements, duties of quarantine officers, pauper immigrants, passenger protection, and recovery of duties and penalties. Establishment of immigration offices: Immigration offices were to be established in London, England, as well as elsewhere in the United Kingdom and in various parts of Canada. Duty payable on immigrants: A duty of one dollar was imposed for immigrants arriving in any port of Canada from any port of the United Kingdom or elsewhere in Europe. Regulations on the conditions of travel: All vessels were required to meet specific regulations on the conditions of travel, specifically at most one adult passenger for every two tons of tonnage. A penalty of between 8 and 20 dollars would be assessed for each passenger in excess of the limit. Reporting and other requirements of master of the vessel: The master of the vessel was required to submit to the Collector of Customs, within 24 hours of arrival, a list of all the passengers who boarded the vessel, along with various details. The master was also required to not let passengers leave until this list had been delivered. Passengers who left the vessel before departing the vessel still needed to be included on the list, along with information that they departed before landing in Canada. Special duties of quarantine officers: In accordance with the Quarantine and Health Act of 1868, the Medical Superintendent at the Quarantine Station at the port of entry, or a person appointed by the superintendent, was to examine all landing passengers to find any \\"Lunatic, Idiotic, Deaf and Dumb, Blind or Infirm Person\\" not belonging to an immigrant family, or anybody else deemed likely to permanently become a public charge. If such passengers were found, the master of the ship would be required to post a bond for 300 dollars as surety for the passenger in order for the passenger to be allowed into Canada. Pauper immigrants: The Act allowed for the landing of pauper immigrants to be prohibited by proclamation of the Governor, and allowed the Governor to temporarily detain such immigrants in the ship they had landed in. Passenger protection: The master of the ship was required to allow passengers to stay for up to 48 hours on the ship after landing, with a penalty of up to 20 dollars for requiring the passenger to vacate before that time. Further, the master of the ship was required to return all the passenger's luggage to the passenger within that time. Some provisions on the time of day for the luggage hand-off were also included. Recovery of duties and penalties: Information was included in the Act on how the duties and penalties imposed on the master of the ship were to be paid, and how disputes around these could be settled. Monies levied and expended: The money for carrying out the provisions of the Act was to come from money periodically provided by Parliament for the purpose. The money levied would be paid out by the Collector of Customs (who would receive it) to the Receiver General, to form part of the Consolidated Revenue Fund of Canada.

It aired in the United States on Fox on December 10, 2017. The title is a spoof of the novel Gone Girl. Plot Sideshow Bob is collecting trash for community service with other men. However, when they finish the work, the Simpson family runs over it with a rental car. After finishing up the rental time and fuel, Homer goes with Bart to play. However, Bart needs to pee and goes in the forest, falling down a manhole. The family and the Springfield Police Department start searching the forest, but Chief Wiggum and his fellow police officers fail as usual. Bart finds himself in some kind of bunker, where he finds electronic equipment, which appears to be a military installment. People start looking for him, including Sideshow Bob and the other detainees. Bart tries to escape, but the ladder gives in. He finds a phone, but instead of calling for help he calls Moe for a prank. Milhouse finds the entrance, but fails to help him. The news states Bart's dead, but Milhouse fails to bring the good news, in favor of Lisa's affection. Sideshow Bob is having issues accepting it and Bart phones Marge confirming he's alive. When Milhouse leaves the house after getting more hugs from Lisa, Bob convinces him to bring him to Bart with the family right behind. Bob shoves Milhouse down the manhole and then following immediately. Homer and Grampa fail to find them once again while Bob ties them up to a Titan II missile and tries to launch them and kill both. He soon starts having regrets and saves them at the advice of the injured prison therapist. As for the Titan II rocket, it crashes near the other sculptures as three people laugh at the Norad name. Back in prison, Sideshow Bob is having his prison therapy. He states that he will do good when his life sentences are done. The prison therapist will continue the session at different times when the lights flickering has him throwing out the files of the other prisoners. Many years later, Sideshow Bob has retired to a lighthouse somewhere as a mailman delivers his mail. He is still going crazy over killing Bart where his message on the beach's sand keeps getting washed by the tides. The mailman states that he wouldn't hear his ranting if he would get a mailbox. Sideshow Bob considers taking that advice. Reception Dennis Perkins of The A.V. Club gave this episode a B+, stating, \\"A coherent narrative throughline‚Äîcheck. Carefully nurtured extended gags‚Äîcheck. Lines that actually made me laugh out loud‚Äîa handful of checks. Couple all that with a refreshing lack of atonal jokes that either violate the show‚Äôs spirit or pander glibly to pop cultural ephemera, and even a halfway decent repurposed Christmas couch gag, and I found that, by the end of ‚ÄòGone Boy,‚Äô I‚Äôd had a uniformly good time watching The Simpsons.\\" Tony Sokol of Den of Geek gave the episode 3/5 stars, saying, \\"The premise promised...by the title of The Simpsons season 29, episode 9, ‚ÄòGone Boy,‚Äô would have made for a far more original offering from the series. The book and film Gone Girl was about a missing wife, who lived such a duplicitous double life, no one wanted to believe the most obvious suspect, her husband, was indeed the killer, had only she died. Bart Simpson lives a duplicitous life and everyone would believe his mortal nemesis would have had no choice but to kill the boy. Sideshow Bob was indeed spotted near the crime scene, associating with known rakes, of the boy, Bart Simpson, he vowed to kill. Bart, of course, is a master prankster and we wouldn‚Äôt have had that much sympathy for him until he turned up again.\\" \\"Gone Boy\\" scored a 2.3 rating with an 8 share and was watched by 6.06 million people, making it Fox's highest rated show of the night.

These policies mean that students who enroll in the university as members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) are not able to express a change in religious beliefs or express their lack thereof without risk of being evicted from their student homes, fired from their campus jobs, or expelled from the university. Currently BYU does not allow students who enrolled as Mormons to change their religious affiliation, and FreeBYU is advocating for university policy to apply the same standards for formerly LDS students as it does for non-LDS students, including charging a higher tuition rate. Actions The organization has petitioned the university, as well as several of its accreditors claiming that it does not meet requirements for religious freedom. These include the American Psychological Association and the American Bar Association which resulted in a change to BYU's honor code in 2016. Shortly after FreeBYU's complaint to the American Bar Association in 2016, BYU had added an \\"Application for Exception\\" clause that would theoretically enable a formerly LDS applicant to be enrolled if there were \\"compelling,\\" \\"extenuating,\\" and \\"unusual circumstances.\\" A BYU spokesperson stated in 2017 that the university believes it is in full compliance with accreditation standards and offers the option of applying for a religious exemption, though, FreeBYU states that exemptions are not being granted and students are discouraged from applying for them. In 2015 the group persuaded the president of the American Academy of Religion, Mark Juergensmeyer, to decline to speak at BYU's 2015 International Law and Religion Symposium in protest of the university's denial of religious freedom to their students. Media coverage The group's advocacy has received television coverage as well as nationwide newspaper coverage including in The Washington Post, The Wall Street Journal, and The Huffington Post.

Political analysts were quick to dismiss Titov's electoral chances and predicted that he will garner no more than 1.5% of the vote. Background Initially the Party of Growth conducted primaries which were attended by four candidates: Oksana Dmitriyeva, Dmitry Potapenko, Dmitry Marinichev and Alexander Khurudzhi. Boris Titov did not participate in the primaries. However, at the meeting of the federal council of the party it was decided to nominate Titov. According to a person from the party leadership, none of the proposed candidates were able to obtain sufficient support.–ë–æ—Ä–∏—Å –¢–∏—Ç–æ–≤ –æ–±—ä—è–≤–∏–ª –æ–± —É—á–∞—Å—Ç–∏–∏ –≤ –≤—ã–±–æ—Ä–∞—Ö –ø—Ä–µ–∑–∏–¥–µ–Ω—Ç–∞ –†–æ—Å—Å–∏–∏ Campaign According to Titov, the main task of participation in election is to promote the party's Growth Strategy economic program, which was prepared by the Stolypin Club and presented to President Vladimir Putin in May 2017.

The game would have had players control a superhero or a team of superheroes to do battle with super villains. The game was originally titled MIST - My Incredible Superhero Team, and was cancelled because Bullfrog were unable to obtain a Marvel licence.  Gameplay  The Indestructibles takes place in the early 20th century, and puts the player in control of a superhero or a team of superheroes to compete against super-villains in a 3D city. The player could have designed a character and its abilities, and had the option of being good or evil. Funding is granted by organisations depending on which side the player chooses: for example, the government if good and from whoever is willing to pay the most if evil. Money is used to research faster and more powerful superheroes and weapons. According to Computer Gaming World, the action would have been based on physics rather than rules, and players would have been able to play as super-villains.  Development  MIST - My Incredible Superhero Team, was in development by July 1995 and set for release in November. It used Bullfrog's Skeletal Mapping (a technique with which a skeleton's actions are calculated by a computer, rather than the artist drawing every possible animation a character could perform) to make it possible for players to create superheroes, according to Peter Molyneux. Edge stated that the game featured a \\"fully modelled\\" city, textured polygon characters, and a Pentium mode that runs at 30 frames per second. The development of the original demo was headed by Glenn Corpes, with Fin McGechie in charge of graphics. This was completed in around three days, with McGechie taking a prototype Dungeon Keeper engine and constructing a city in Hi-Octane editor. The collision detection and multiplayer were taken from Magic Carpet. The game had been renamed to The Indestructibles by February 1996, and was produced by Sean Cooper. At this time, PC Zone said the game looked \\"so damn impressive\\", and because of this, Cooper would give the magazine monthly reports on its development. He stated that he had \\"very strong views\\" on how he would have liked it to look, and that he wanted it done his own way and \\"nothing like it has ever been done before\\". The game was originally had a futuristic setting, but Cooper decided that he wanted a brighter and more colourful environment for daytime settings and a \\"dull monochrome\\" appearance for night-time. He said the latter was important because it creates atmosphere and that he did not want it to look like anything else. The game was of Molyneux's design. In his second report, Cooper said they had done \\"a helluva lot\\"on the game. This included \\"sorting out\\" the character movement, module linking, and ensuring the graphics and sound worked. Cooper stated that he was \\"supremely confident\\" the game would be great, and that they were seeking an animation house to do cartoon animation, which he wanted to be very colourful. By this time, Andy Nuttall had been hired as the game's Assistant Producer. In his third report, he stated that he was taking a year off, and the game was expected to be released in autumn (fall) 1997. He said that all of Bullfrog's other lead programmers were doing other projects, and therefore the continuation of programming would be delayed until one had been completed. Of the characters, Cooper said that the cars and the player's team members were to be created using vector graphics, and the civilians using \\"a mixture of sprites\\". He said that vectors were useful because they enable the characters to be more flexible and they use less memory, which he said was useful because the game was being developed for the Sony PlayStation and Sega Saturn. By late 1995, the Saturn version's expected release date was mid 1996. Cooper also stated that he was \\"working hard\\" to make The Indestructibles an impressive multiplayer game, and that he wanted to the BT Wireplay network. According to G√©n√©ration 4, The Indestructibless artificial intelligence featured \\"very powerful\\" algorithms that analysed the player's combat techniques and countered them. By August 1998, the game's engine had been completely revamped, and the setting was no longer the 1920s. The game was focused at 3D hardware, and had an engine capable of \\"displaying enormous levels\\". The level scripting language was descended from Creations. Artist Fin McGhie said that development was not smooth and that it eventually become apparent that it would be unlikely to be completed. He left to form Mucky Foot Productions and The Indestructibles was rebooted, but that also \\"didn't work out\\". According to Corpes, The Indestructibles was cancelled because Marvel Comics threatened to intervene if any of the game's superheroes resembled any of theirs. According to Bullfrog designer Alex Trowers, the game was cancelled due to the lack interest in designing superheroes and an inability to obtain a Marvel licence. Corpes said the game \\"would have been cool\\", and Molyneux said it \\"was a really nice game idea\\".

Benjamin Netanyahu, the Prime Minister of Israel, welcomed the decision and praised the announcement. On December 8, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson clarified that the President's statement \\"did not indicate any final status for Jerusalem\\" and \\"was very clear that the final status, including the borders, would be left to the two parties to negotiate and decide.\\" Trump's decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital was rejected by a majority of world leaders. The United Nations Security Council held an emergency meeting on December 7 where 14 out of 15 members condemned Trump's decision, but the motion was vetoed by the United States. Britain, France, Sweden, Italy and Japan were among the countries who criticized Trump's decision at the emergency meeting. Other countries supported the move: Guatemala said that they will follow up and also relocate their embassy; Paraguay, the Czech Republic, Romania and Honduras said that they were considering relocation. The European Union's foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini said that all governments of EU member states were united on the issue of Jerusalem, and also reaffirmed their commitment to a Palestinian State with East Jerusalem as its capital. Representatives from 32 countries were present at opening of the embassy, including EU members Austria, Czech Republic and Romania. Palestinian officials have said the announcement disqualifies the United States from peace talks, while Hamas called for a new intifada following Trump's declarations. Following the announcement there were demonstrations throughout the West Bank and Gaza Strip, as well as in various countries around the world. By December 25, 2017, Salafi groups had fired almost 30 rockets towards Israel from the Gaza Strip, with almost half landing inside Gaza. Two caused minor damage to property near Ashkelon and Sderot, and Hamas rounded up the Salafists thought responsible for the attacks. On February 23, 2018, the U.S. State Department announced the new US embassy would open in May that year. The US embassy was officially opened in Jerusalem on May 14, 2018, coinciding with the 70th anniversary of the Israeli Declaration of Independence. Protests on the Gaza border were met with tear gas and sniper fire by the Israel Defence Forces, resulting in the deaths of at least 58 Palestinians, the highest single-day death toll since the 2014 Israel‚ÄìGaza conflict. The IDF and the Israeli government defended the use of force as necessary due to rocks and explosives thrown by protesters. The location of the relocated embassy is at the former site of its consulate general in the Arnona neighborhood, in West Jerusalem. Background Israel occupied East Jerusalem during the Six-Day War in 1967 and formally annexed it in 1980 (see Jerusalem Law).\\"East Jerusalem\\". BBC News. After the founding of the State of Israel in 1949, the United States recognized the new state, but considered it desirable to establish an international regime for Jerusalem, with its final status resolved through negotiations. The US opposed Israel's declaration of Jerusalem as its capital in 1949 and opposed Jordan's plan to make Jerusalem its second capital announced in 1950. The US also opposed Israel's annexation of East Jerusalem after the 1967 war. The official United States position has been that the future of Jerusalem should be the subject of a negotiated settlement.Adam Kredo, Solving the White House photo mystery over ‚ÄòJerusalem, Israel‚Äô. JTA, August 16, 2011 Subsequent administrations have maintained the position that Jerusalem's future not be the subject of unilateral actions that could prejudice negotiations, such as by moving the US embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. During the 1992 presidential election, Bill Clinton promised that his administration would \\"support Jerusalem as the capital of the State of Israel\\" and criticized President George H. W. Bush for having \\"repeatedly challenged Israel‚Äôs sovereignty over a united Jerusalem.\\" However, after the signing of the Oslo Accords in 1993, the Clinton administration did not proceed with their plans in order not to disturb the negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians. In 1995, Congress passed the Jerusalem Embassy Act, which declared that \\"Jerusalem should be recognized as the capital of the State of Israel.\\"Jerusalem Embassy Act of 1995, , November 8, 1995, 109 Stat. 398. The bill also stated that the American embassy should move to Jerusalem within five years. Backing the legislation was viewed by some as reflecting American domestic politics. Clinton opposed the Jerusalem Embassy Act and signed a waiver every six months delaying the move. During the 2000 election campaign, George W. Bush criticized Clinton for not moving the embassy as he had promised to do, and said he planned on initiating the process himself as soon as he was elected. However, once he took office, he backed down on his promise. In 2008, Democratic candidate Barack Obama called Jerusalem the 'capital of Israel'. On June 4, 2008, Obama told the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC), in his first foreign policy speech after capturing the Democratic nomination the day before, that \\"Jerusalem will remain the capital of Israel, and it must remain undivided.\\" However, he backtracked almost immediately, saying \\"Well, obviously, it's going to be up to the parties to negotiate a range of these issues. And Jerusalem will be part of those negotiations.\\" During the 2016 US Presidential election, one of Trump's campaign promises was to move the US embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, which he described as the \\"eternal capital of the Jewish people.\\" On June 1, 2017, Trump signed a waiver on the Jerusalem Embassy Act, delaying the move of the US embassy to Jerusalem for another six months, as had every president before him since 1995. The White House stated that this would help them negotiate a deal between Israel and Palestine, and that the promised move would come at a later time. Announcement President Trump's statement on Jerusalem, December 6, 2017 On December 6, 2017 President Trump formally recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and stated that the American embassy would be moved from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. In his statement Donald Trump did not mention East Jerusalem as the capital of a future Palestinian state, but he did say that United States recognition did not resolve the dispute over Jerusalem's borders. President Trump explicitly stated his support for maintaining the status quo of the holy sites within the Old City. Following the announcement, Trump signed the waiver, delaying the move by at least another six months. Following Trump's announcement, American embassies in Turkey, Jordan, Germany and Britain issued security alerts for Americans traveling or living in those countries. The United States also issues a general warning for Americans abroad about the possibility of violent protests. The American consulate in Jerusalem has restricted travel of government employees to Jerusalem's Old City. The US Embassy in Jordan banned employees from leaving the capital and children of embassy employees were told to stay home from school. State Department remarks Secretary of State Rex Tillerson later clarified that the President's statement \\"did not indicate any final status for Jerusalem\\" and \\"was very clear that the final status, including the borders, would be left to the two parties to negotiate and decide.\\" State Department officials said on December 8 that there will not be any immediate practical changes in how the US deals with Jerusalem, including its policy of not listing a country on the passports of citizens born in Jerusalem. Israeli Jews praying at the Western WallWhen asked what country the Western Wall is in, State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said \\"We're not taking any position on the overall boundaries. We are recognizing Jerusalem as the capital of Israel.\\" American domestic reactions =Former US ambassadors to Israel= Out of 11 former US ambassadors to Israel, nine were critical of Trump's policy change. Ogden R. Reid who served as an ambassador to Israel from 1959 to 1961 was one of the exceptions, saying, \\"I think it's the right decision.\\" Edward S. Walker Jr. who served from 1997 to 1999 also supported recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital: \\"It's really a question of what are the lines, the borders, to be drawn around the state of Israel and the ultimate state of Palestine.\\" Daniel C. Kurtzer noted America's international isolation in his remarks and Richard H. Jones expressed concerns that moving the embassy would fuel further violence. A number of former ambassadors, such as Martin S. Indyk stated that they were open to recognition of West Jerusalem as Israel's capital, provided Israel would agree to slow settlement construction and recognize East Jerusalem as the Palestinian capital. =American Christian organizations= American Christian organizations were divided: the National Council of Churches (NCC) which represents 38 different denominations issued a statement saying the change in policy was likely to exacerbate regional conflict and cost lives, while the Liberty Counsel, a right wing evangelical organization supported the decision. The move had been supported by many conservative American evangelical organizations and leaders including American Christian Leaders for Israel, Jerry Falwell, and Mike Huckabee. Johnnie Moore, one of Trump's evangelical advisers, said the announcement fulfilled a campaign promise to Trump's evangelical voter base. It was also welcomed by Rabbi Yechiel Eckstein, the founder of the International Fellowship of Christians and Jews. =American Jewish organizations= The majority of prominent American Jewish organizations welcomed the move, including the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations, which comprises 51 national Jewish organizations, as well as by a number of its member organizations: AIPAC, the Jewish Federations of North America, the American Jewish Congress, the American Jewish Committee, Hadassah, the Union of Orthodox Jewish Congregations of America and the National Council of Young Israel. The Conservative Movement's US, Israel and global branches also welcomed US recognition of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. Orthodox Union, the US' largest umbrella organization representing Orthodox Jews, thanked Trump for \\"beginning the process of relocating the US Embassy to Jerusalem\\". The Anti- Defamation League said recognition was \\"important and long overdue\\", while continuing to express support for a two state solution. AIPAC expressed its support for an \\"undivided Jerusalem\\" but also said that relocating the American embassy to Jerusalem would not \\"prejudge the outcome of the Israeli- Palestinian peace process\\". Morton Klein, who heads the Zionist Organization of America, said that Trump was \\"finally recognizing the obvious\\". The Simon Wiesenthal Center said Trump's announcement \\"will right an historic wrong\\". The announcement was also welcomed by the Republican Jewish Coalition. The Reform Jewish movement called it \\"ill-timed\\" and said it would \\"exacerbate the conflict\\", but also declared that \\"Jerusalem is the eternal capital of the Jewish people and the State of Israel\\" and that they \\"share the President's belief that the US embassy should, at the right time, be moved from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem\\". The Jewish Democratic Council of America similarly expressed support for Jerusalem as an undivided capital of Israel, but criticized Trump for neglecting to \\"meaningfully support peace between Palestinians and Israelis\\". Left-wing Mideast policy group J Street said the timing was \\"premature and divisive\\". J Street, New Israel Fund, and progressive Zionist organization Ameinu expressed concerns that the move would undermine Middle East peace efforts and could lead to violence. =Other American groups= In December 2017, more than 130 Jewish studies scholars from across North America criticized the Trump administration's decision, calling on the U.S. government to take actions to de-escalate the tensions and \\"clarify Palestinians' legitimate stake in the future of Jerusalem.\\" According to Haaretz, many of these scholars have been critical of the Trump administration and the current Israeli government. American Muslim civil advocacy groups rejected the policy change, including the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) and the Muslim Public Affairs Council (MPAC). On December 5, Muslim, Interfaith and human rights groups held a protest outside the White House. Israeli and Palestinian responses Israel Jerusalem on May 7, 2018 On December 6, shortly after Trump's statement, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the announcement was a \\"historic landmark\\" and praised the decision as \\"courageous and just\\". During his remarks Netanyahu said there is \\"no peace that doesn't include Jerusalem as the capital of the State of Israel\\", adding that Jerusalem has \\"been the capital of Israel for nearly 70 years\\". He later said that he has heard condemnation about the announcement but has \\"not heard any condemnation for the rocket firing against Israel that has come and the awful incitement against us\\". The announcement was well received by Knesset members of left, right and centre parties including Yesh Atid, Bayit Yehudi, Yisrael Beytenu, and Likud. Isaac Herzog called it an \\"act of historic justice\\" but also added that the next step was to \\"realize the vision of two states\\". In contrast, Bezalel Smotrich of the religious zionist Bayit Yehudi party issued the following statement: \\"For 30 years we have fallen into the pit of the Palestinian state as a realistic solution. The time has come to rethink things\\". Avi Gabbay, the leader the Zionist Union, also supported Trump's announcement, saying that recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital is more important than a peace deal. Israel's Deputy Education Minister Meir Porush of United Torah Judaism party said building in \\"parts of Judea and Samaria and Jerusalem that need housing would be better than a declaration that means nothing\\". Yisrael Eichler, also of UTJ, expressed similar views saying he would \\"rather have 1,000 homes for young couples in Jerusalem than one American embassy building.\\" In contrast, left- wing party Meretz said recognition of Jerusalem should only come with the establishment of a Palestinian state with East Jerusalem as its capital, adding that Trump's declaration \\"de facto betrays the Zionist vision and the values on which the State of Israel was established\\". Hanin Zoabi and Ayman Odeh, both members of the Arab Joint List party, said the US could no longer act as a peace mediator. Odeh said that \\"Trump is a pyromaniac and will set the entire region ablaze with his madness\\". Palestinian Authority and Hamas  Palestinian officials said the announcement disqualifies the United States from peace talks. Palestinian prime minister Rami Hamdallah said the policy change \\"destroys the peace process\\". Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas gave a speech where he said the decision meant the United States was \\"abdicating its role as a peace mediator\\". Palestinian Foreign Minister Riyad al-Maliki similarly said the United States could no longer act as a mediator in the peace process because it had become a party to the dispute. Adnan al-Husayni asked the Organization of Islamic Cooperation to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Palestine. Hamas called for a new intifada, but the response from Palestinians inside Jerusalem was relatively muted. Protests were held in East Jerusalem, the West Bank, and the Gaza Strip. Palestinians burned portraits and effigies of Donald Trump and tore pictures of Salman bin Abdulaziz and Muhammad bin Salman in protest of the embassy move. The Israel military estimated that 3,000 people in the West Bank and 4,500 in the Gaza Strip participated in protests on December 8, 2017. The Jerusalem announcement inspired activist Ahmed Abu Artema to write a Facebook proposing the outlines of the Great March of Return protests. Multiple camps of Palestinians engaged in protest along the fenceline of the Gaza Strip as part of this effort in late March 2018, demanding the right of Palestinian refugees and their descendants to return to their former homes in Israel, and an end to the blockade of the Gaza Strip, as well as rejecting recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital. The opening of the US embassy in Jerusalem on May 14 coincided with a major escalation of the protests, resulting in the death of 64 protesters on that day. Christian churches based in Jerusalem On December 6, 2017, the primate of the Greek Orthodox Church of Jerusalem, Patriarch Theophilos III, widely regarded as the most senior Christian figure in Jerusalem, and twelve other church leaders in the Holy Land sent a letter to Trump warning that his move ‚Äúw[ould] yield increased hatred, conflict, violence and suffering in Jerusalem and the Holy Land, moving us farther from the goal of unity and deeper toward destructive division‚Äù.What does US recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital mean? The Guardian, December 6, 2017. Apart from Theophilos III, the letter was signed by heads of Jerusalem's Syrian, Armenian, Ethiopioan and Coptic Orthodox patriarchates as well as the Roman Catholic Church's Apostolic Administrator for Jerusalem (the Latin Patriarchate of Jerusalem). It was also signed by the Franciscan Order, the Greek-Melkite-Catholic patriarchate, the Maronites, the Episcopal Church, the Armenian Catholic and Syrian Catholic churches and the Evangelical Lutherans. International response Trump's Jerusalem decision was widely condemned by world leaders. European US allies that objected include Britain, Germany, Italy and France. Romania, on the other hand, declined to follow the EU position and also indicated it may relocate its embassy to Jerusalem. Pope Francis also made a plea that all nations remain committed to \\"respecting the status quo\\" of the city. China urged caution regarding the potential escalation of tensions in the Middle East. United Nations  =Pre- announcement= Shortly before Trump's announcement, in November 2017, the United Nations General Assembly voted on a resolution in Jerusalem 151‚Äì6 with 9 abstentions. The resolution stated that \\"any actions by Israel, the occupying Power, to impose its laws, jurisdiction and administration on the Holy City of Jerusalem were illegal and therefore null and void.

Biography Heath was born in Kingston Upon Hull. Little is known of her childhood but later in life she indicated that her father had been a chemist and that she had been educated by nuns. Heath studied at the Acad√©mie Colarossi in Paris before, in the late 1930s, taking classes at the school of painting run by Leonard Fuller in St Ives. During World War II Heath worked as an illustrator for the Ministry of Information, painting and drawing workers in ordinance factories and at a camouflage factory in St Ives. During the war, she also made pencil drawings of British and American troops stationed in Cornwall. She was given permission to record naval subjects and also spent time at the Spitfire station at RAF Perranporth. During the conflict she met her future husband, Dr. Marc Prati, a political correspondent for La Stampa, who as an Italian national had been interned in Cornwall. Heath was a member of the St Ives Society of Artists and in 1949 was a founder member of the breakaway Penwith Society of Arts but resigned in 1950 and rejoined the St Ives Society in 1957. She continued to exhibit with the St Ives Society for the rest of her life. The Cornish landscape was the principal subject of Heath's paintings and she would regularly camp out on the moors in Cornwall for several days at a time painting landscapes. In 1962, for the Royal Watercolour Society she organized an exhibition of unknown Cornish artists, entitled The Cornish Experiment. Heath exhibited with the Royal Institute of Oil Painters, Royal Institute of Painters in Water Colours and the Royal Scottish Academy. She was included in the centenary exhibition of the Society of Women Artists held in London during 1955. Heath also published three volumes of poetry.

The work was commissioned by the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, for which Ogonek co-serves as Mead composer-in-residence with the composer Samuel Adams. The piece was given its world premiere by the Chicago Symphony Orchestra under the direction of Riccardo Muti on September 28, 2017.Muti Conducts Bruckner 4. Chicago Symphony Orchestra. December 10, 2017. Composition All These Lighted Things was composed over a period of five months in 2017. The title of the piece comes from a poem by Thomas Merton. The work has a duration of approximately 15 minutes and is cast in three short movements: #Exuberant, playful, bright #Gently drifting, hazy #Buoyant Instrumentation The work is scored for a large orchestra consisting of two flutes, two piccolos, two oboes, two clarinets and E-flat clarinet, two bassoons, four horns, three trumpets, three trombones, tuba, timpani, percussion, and strings. Reception Reviewing the world premiere, the music critic John von Rhein of the Chicago Tribune wrote, \\"Ogonek works painstakingly at her craft and it shows in the acutely wrought instrumental detail that pervades her 15-minute opus.\\" He continued, \\"Dancelike figures drive the first and third dances (Ogonek originally considered writing a set of modern mazurkas out of respect for her Polish heritage), set off by the gently drifting haze of tonal lyricism ‚Äî Charles Ives without the dissonant harmonic clashes ‚Äî of the central dance. Her inventive, even jazzy writing for chiming crotales, triangles and tubular bells, over shifting meters, kept percussionist Cynthia Yeh and colleagues happily engaged. It's an attractive piece that went down easily ‚Äî perhaps too easily ‚Äî with Thursday's audience.\\" Hedy Weiss of the Chicago Sun-Times similarly remarked, \\"It is a new work that deserves many hearings, and one that is sure to offer additional pleasures with each of them.\\" Despite praising Ogonek's chamber violin concerto In Silence as \\"a small masterpiece,\\" Lawrence A. Johnson of the Chicago Classical Review was more critical of All These Lighted Things, observing, \\"Like many young composers with minimal orchestra experience, one gets the sense of Ogonek stitching together offbeat sounds and disparate colors that offer some striking sonic effects yet lack a sense of direction and overall development‚Äîeven in the brief spans of three short movements.\\" He added: References Category:Compositions by Elizabeth Ogonek Category:2017 compositions Category:Compositions for symphony orchestra Category:Music commissioned by the Chicago Symphony Orchestra ","title":"All These Lighted Things"},{"id":"56017170","text":"Costea Bucioc or Coste BƒÉcioc (also known as B√ºczek;Stoicescu, p. 348. ? ‚Äì July or September 1620) was a Moldavian statesman, commander of the military forces, and father-in-law of Prince Lupu (Vasile) Coci. He began his political career in the 1580s, emerging in the late 1590s as an ally of the Movile»ôti dynasty, with then-Prince Ieremia MovilƒÉ advancing him to the post of Clucer. From 1601, he was Constantin MovilƒÉ's Paharnic, receiving from him the estate of Deleni and other villages around H√¢rlƒÉu, which formed part of a Bucioc domain that also extended into Bukovina and Bessarabia. Together with the Movile»ôti, he became one of the great landowners of his generation, and one of the first Moldavian boyars known to have owned serfs. Some of his assets went into refurbishing R√¢»ôca Monastery, of which he was patron, or ktitor. As an army leader, Costea was involved in the Moldavian Magnate Wars, during which the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth fought to emancipate its Movile»ôti clients from subservience to the Ottoman Empire. Although Buciuc followed the princely family into its Polish exile in 1611 or 1612, he criticized Constantin's repeated attempts to reconquer Moldavia. During the events that led to Constantin's defeat and drowning, he became a supporter of the Ottoman- appointed Radu Mihnea, emerging as great Vornic of the Lower Country. Bucioc maintained his standing under Prince Gaspar Graziani, despite a mutual hostility: reportedly, Graziani tried to poison his Vornic, and arrested Coci. The two had reconciled by 1620, when Graziani involved Moldavia on the Polish side in a new war with the Ottomans, fought on Moldavian territory. While Coci spoke out against the project, Bucioc may have commanded the Moldavian troops and been present for the defeat at »öu»õora. He was eventually captured by the enemy, possibly after attempting to hide in Brani»ôte. He was finally a prisoner of Iskender Pasha, who had him impaled on charges of treason. As an Ottoman loyalist, Coci climbed through the ranks of boyardom, and finally became Prince, as \\"Vasile Lupu\\" in 1634. Bucioc's grandchildren were Ioan Coci, who was at the center of his father's project for a takeover in Wallachia, but died young in 1639. His father's regime survived to 1653, by which time Bucioc's other granddaughter, Ruxandra, had become wife and widow of Tymofiy Khmelnytsky, an Otaman of the Cossack Hetmanate. Another granddaughter, Maria, moved to Lithuania with her husband Janusz Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç. The Bucioc inheritance, including Deleni, finally went to collateral relatives, who formed a Moldavian branch of the Cantacuzino family. The Vornics life was revisited in literature by V. A. Urechia, whose eponymous play was a major success in the 1860s and '70s. Biography With and against the Movile»ôti Bucioc was born during a time when Moldavia and Wallachia, the Danubian Principalities, were submitted to the Ottomans as tributary states. He probably belonged to the boyar aristocracy by right, being the son of an Ion BƒÉcioc, who may or may not have been a Vornic, and brother of an Ilea BƒÉcioc.Stoicescu, pp. 336, 347, 355. His uncles included a Dumitra»ôco MƒÉlai, father of the Vistier (treasurer) Simion MƒÉlai.Bacalov, p. 326. Costea's own career probably began in the 1580s: a 1585 writ by Prince Peter the Lame confirms Bucioc as an administrator (or P√¢rcƒÉlab) of Hotin.Rosetti, p. 244. The same document refers to Bucioc's earlier purchase, from Prince Iancu Sasul, of a village called Lunca Mare, with free use of its population as serfs or vecini (Church Slavonic: ); this is the first mention of such a category in Moldavia's history, and among the first in medieval Romanian history.Rosetti, pp. 244, 260, 274. On February 20, 1598, Prince Ieremia MovilƒÉ made Bucioc P√¢rcƒÉlab of Orhei, also giving him a seat on the Boyar Council.Stoicescu, p. 347. After the brief conquest of Moldavia by Michael the Brave and the presence of Marcu Cercel on the Moldavian throne (1600), Bucioc regained high offices under the returning Ieremia. On March 4, 1601, he was attested as a Clucer, his tenure ending on August 30, 1603. Bucioc is not known to have held any office between that date and July 15, 1608, when another Movile»ôti, the young monarch Constantin, appointed him great Paharnic. He was again mentioned as holding that position on September 28 of the following year, and served to November 19, 1611.Stoicescu, p. 347. See also Luca, p. 52. According to various reports of the period, Constantin granted his Paharnic an estate at Deleni, in FƒÉlciu County.Bacalov, p. 341; Botezatu, pp. 23‚Äì24. Various scholars believe that he was by then married to Irina PrƒÉjescu, daughter of a tax farmer from Suceava.»òtefan S. Gorovei, \\"Recitind atent trecutul. Originea socialƒÉ a √Ænaltului cler monahal\\", in Magazin Istoric, June 1998, p. 65. See also Gorovei (2014), p. 261; Luca, pp. 53, 54; Stoicescu, pp. 347‚Äì348. This connection would have made Bucioc a member by proxy of the extended Movile»ôti clan.Gorovei (2014), p. 261. According to such readings, she was the mother of his two sons, Lupa»ôcu and Iona»ôco.Luca, pp. 53, 54. Costea's brother had wed Lupa Toader, daughter of Vistier Iosif Veveri»õƒÉ. Costea's niece Ileana went on to marry Dumitru Buhu»ô, also a Vistier.Stoicescu, pp. 336, 347, 355, 357. Later, Costea is known to have been married to a Candachia »òoldan,Botezatu, p. 23; Gane, p. 248; Iorga, p. 120; Luca, pp. 53, 54, 73; Stoicescu, p. 347. daughter of the Logothete PƒÉtra»ôcu NƒÉbƒÉdaico »òoldan. From her family, Bucioc received as a gift the estate of Ru»ôii, outside Deleni, which probably contained a deserted Ruthenian (or Ukrainian) village.Mircea Ciubotaru, \\"O problemƒÉ de demografie istoricƒÉ de la sf√¢r»ôitul domniei lui »òtefan cel Mare\\", in Analele Putnei, Vol. I, Issue 1, 2005, pp. 73‚Äì74. He also inherited from PƒÉtra»ôcu a number of vineyards outside Cotnari, and several vacated villages around H√¢rlƒÉu. The latter were in fact purchased from the Prince as a disguised form of financial assistance for the central authority, which was at the time beleaguered by Ottoman fiscal demands.Botezatu, pp. 23, 29. As noted by the agricultural historian Radu Rosetti, the Bucioc family helped the Movile»ôti exercise control over Moldavia's land fund through original accumulation, thus eliminating competition from other boyars.Rosetti, pp. 238‚Äì239, 244, 251, 307‚Äì308. By 1620 Costea, a \\"consumer of estates\\", had 38 or 39 villages to his name.Rosetti, pp. 244, 251. Some were in the eastern region later known as Bessarabia (presently, Moldova), including parts of H√Ænce»ôti that he later sold, as well as VƒÉdeni.Luca, pp. 53, 72‚Äì73; Rosetti, p. 244. Prince Constantin's Polonophilia was viewed with alarm by his own liege, the Sultan Ahmed I, who put up »òtefan Tom»ôa as a replacement.Dumitrescu, p. 38. The Movile»ôti, led by a dowager princess Elisabeta MovilƒÉ, decided to resist the Ottoman Army. Alongside Nestor Ureche, Bucioc led a delegation of boyars to the Polish king, Sigismund III Vasa, asking for military support.Dumitrescu, p. 38. See also Stoicescu, p. 347. The plan failed, and the Movile»ôti, initially barricaded in Hotin Fortress, entered Poland at Kamieniec.Dumitrescu, pp. 38‚Äì39; Gane, pp. 165‚Äì168. Tom»ôa declined Bucioc's services, and under his subsequent rule he appears as \\"former great Paharnic\\". During that interval, Bucioc was a ktitor of R√¢»ôca Monastery, which had been devastated in 1574 by Crimean Tatars. Anca BrƒÉtuleanu, \\"SOS provincia. MƒÉnƒÉstirea R√¢»ôca\\", in Dilema Veche, Issue 486, June 2013. His restoration of the building included the addition of a porch or peristyle which art historians describe as \\"unusually large\\" or \\"distasteful\\".Iorga, pp. 120‚Äì121. From exile, the Movile»ôti still made attempts to recover Moldavia, but their expedition of July 1612 ended in defeat at Cornul lui Sas. Constantin was captured by Tom»ôa's allies from the Budzhak Horde, and accidentally drowned while in its custody.Dumitrescu, p. 40; Gane, pp. 166‚Äì170. At some point in 1611 or 1612,Dumitrescu, p. 47; Stoicescu, pp. 333, 348. Bucioc joined the Movile»ôti in U≈õcie (Ustya). While here, he purchased Bobule»ôti, in Dorohoi county, from Princess Ana, a descendant of Alexandru LƒÉpu»ôneanu.C. BƒÉlan, \\"Recenzii. Alexandru I. Gon»õa. Documente privind istoria Rom√¢niei. A. Moldova veacurile XIV‚ÄîXVII (1384‚Äî1625). Indicele numelor de persoane\\", in Studii »ôi Materiale de Istorie Medie, Vol. XIV, 1996, p. 160. This period cemented Bucioc's alliance with Ureche, together with whom he instigated riots against Radu Mihnea. However, by 1616 both had become dissidents, refusing to return to Moldavia with his new liege, Alexandru MovilƒÉ‚Äîreportedly, Ureche argued that doing so would have been certain death.Stoicescu, pp. 333, 348. See also Dumitrescu, p. 47. After some early successes, which included making Alexandru Prince of Moldavia and obtaining more support from exiled Wallachians under Radu »òerban, the Movile»ôti and their Polish backers were defeated at DrƒÉc»ôani by a coalition of Ottomans and Ottoman vassals, under Iskender Pasha.Dumitrescu, pp. 43‚Äì48; Gane, pp. 170‚Äì191. Alexandru was forcefully converted to Islam, while Elisabeta became an Ottoman sex slave.Dumitrescu, pp. 47‚Äì48; Gane, pp. 170‚Äì191, 198. According to historian Gavril Luca, Bucioc was actually in Tom»ôa's camp during the DrƒÉc»ôani debacle, leading into battle a 2,000-strong regiment of Tatar mercenaries.Luca, p. 53. As Vornic Budzhak Tatars fighting for the Ottoman Army, ahead of the battle at »öu»õora. Gouache painting by J√≥zef Ryszkiewicz, 1909 Bucioc had switched his loyalties toward Radu Mihnea, the Ottoman-appointed Prince, and was thus able to return to Moldavia. On August 15, 1616, Bucioc was appointed great Vornic of the Lower Country. He maintained this office to October 13, but was reinstated on May 12, 1617, though he was probably moved to the Upper Country (or Bukovina).Luca, p. 71. His Deleni estate was briefly confiscated by princely command. Radu Mihnea eventually reinstated Bucioc as owner, with a writ in which he apologized for having believed the testimonies of \\"mendacious men\\".Botezatu, pp. 23, 24. According to historian Daniel Botezatu, the document may show that Radu Mihnea intended to warn his subordinate about what would happen should he switch sides again.Botezatu, p. 24. Through the »òoldans, Bucioc was ultimately related to the Cantacuzino family, which rose to prominence later that century. Iordaki, son of Andronikos Kantakouzenos, was his brother-in-law, having married another one of PƒÉtra»ôcu NƒÉbƒÉdaico's daughters, CatrinaBacalov, pp. 322‚Äì323, 326, 343‚Äì345; Stoicescu, pp. 363‚Äì365, 415. (some authors describe Catrina as Costea's own daughter).Gane, p. 248; Luca, pp. 53‚Äì54, 63, 71, 72. Simion MƒÉlai also became brothers-in-law with his cousin by marrying a third »òoldan sister, Alexandra.Stoicescu, p. 415. See also Gane, p. 248. The three brothers-in-law shared a deed for the ownership of TrifƒÉu»õi, on Bessarabia's border with Podolia.Bacalov, p. 326. According to historian N. Stoicescu, Bucioc remarried later in life, to a daughter of Hetman OrƒÉ»ô, whose name is unrecorded. However, records from 1626 show that Candachia was still alive, and describe her as his wife.Luca, p. 73. By 1620, Bucioc's children also included two daughters. Tudosca, who may have been Irina PrƒÉjescu's daughter,Gorovei (2014), pp. 261‚Äì262. married Radu Mihnea's Postelnic, Lupu Coci; the other daughter, name unknown, married another Vornic, Gheorghe Mo»õoc.Luca, pp. 54, 62, 72, 73, 75; Stoicescu, pp. 347, 355, 376, 419. According to researcher Constantin Gane, Bucioc \\"must have understood what [Coci] was made of\\", selecting as his son-in-law someone \\"dashing, daring, courageous and ambitious, above all else ambitious.\\"Gane, p. 248. Tudosca's dowry included the village of »òerbe»ôti, which became a residence of the Coci family,Dan MihƒÉilescu, \\"O ctitorie a domnitorului Vasile Lupu ‚Äì Biserica 'Sf. Gheorghe' din »òerbe»ôti (Jude»õul Neam»õ)\\", in Acta Moldaviae Meridionalis, Vols. XII‚ÄìXIV, Part II, 2001‚Äì2003, p. 589. the villages of FƒÉrcƒÉ»ôeni and AvrƒÉme»ôti, which Lupu later donated to his Trei Ierarhi Monastery, and a townhouse at Ia»ôi. In February 1619, Radu Mihnea presented his resignation to the Sultan.Botezatu, p. 23. Bucioc's tenure was not interrupted by the enthronement of a new Prince, Gaspar Graziani (February 4, 1619); he served to July 20, 1620. Nevertheless, an account popularized later in the 17th century by Miron Costin claims that Graziani attempted to poison Bucioc, as well as imprisoning his son-in-law Coci.Gane, pp. 249‚Äì250; Luca, p. 52; Stoicescu, pp. 347‚Äì348, 376‚Äì377. As Costin reports, Bucioc was saved because he carried with him an antidote.Gane, p. 250; Luca, p. 52. In April 1620, the two statesmen were on good terms, with Graziani awarding Bucioc another Bessarabian estate, at MƒÉrcule»ôti.Sergiu Ciobanu, \\"Patrimoniul funciar de»õinut de Andrei Corcodel\\", in Studium, Vol. VII, 2015, p. 51. See also Rosetti, p. 244. That year, Graziani realigned Moldavia with the Commonwealth, and the subsequent war with the Ottomans was fought mostly on Moldavian territory. According to one reading, Graziani assigned command of the Moldavian army to Bucioc, who, in September 1620, fought alongside the Poles, and lost, a decisive battle at »öu»õora. Following this, Bucioc and his supporters withdrew into Poland, but were captured by the Tatars, and delivered to Iskender Pasha. Another version is that he never had a military role to play in the conflict, and as early as July went into hiding at Brani»ôte, hoping that his godson, the Bessarabian boyar Toader BrƒÉni»ôteriul, would protect him. He was betrayed and taken in chains to the Ottoman encampment.Gane, p. 250; Luca, p. 52. The Ottoman Empire deemed him a traitor, alleging his participation in the massacre of expatriate Turks, which Graziani had seen through.Luca, pp. 52, 72. Iskender ordered Bucioc's impalement or, as Costin puts it, \\"immediately had him pierced through, this poor man Bucioc, who was always such a good adviser to Prince Gaspar\\".Gane, p. 250. His biographers provide various dates for the execution: some argue that it occurred on July 20,Luca, pp. 52, 53. others propose late September. Legacy The Coci ascendancy Bucioc's granddaughter, Maria Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç, in a 1730s painting After taking over Graziani's throne, Alexandru Ilia»ô confiscated some of the Bucioc family assets, donating his plot in Cotnari to Saint Sava Monastery of Berzun»õi; in 1622, Tom»ôa was again Prince, and as such restored ownership of VƒÉdeni to the Buciocs.Luca, p. 72. Both of Bucioc's sons were was still active in the early 1630s, when, with Moise MovilƒÉ emerging as Prince, Lupa»ôcu served terms as Vornic.Luca, pp. 52, 54, 71, 72. His brother-in-law Coci had been opposed to Graziani's anti-Ottoman policies, and therefore enjoyed a steady rise through the boyar ranks under Alexandru Ilia»ô, then under new reigns by Tom»ôa and Radu Mihnea. Himself a great Vornic of the Lower Country in 1630, he became a kingmaker, led a pro- Ottoman revolt against Miron Barnovschi.Stoicescu, p. 376. See also Gane, pp. 250‚Äì253. He was eventually appointed Prince in 1634, taking a new name, Vasile Lupu. From Tudosca, who was his first wife, Lupu had three children: a son, Ioan, and two daughters, Maria and Ruxandra.Gane, pp. 249, 256‚Äì258, 277, 284; Luca, pp. 54‚Äì57; Gorovei (2014), pp. 256, 259, 261; Zabolotnaia, p. 9. Some scholars believe that Tudosca may have had a third daughter, whose precise name and career are disputed.Luca, pp. 54‚Äì55; Gane, pp. 249, 273‚Äì277. Another contentious issue is the claim that Ioan and Maria were not Tudora's children, but in fact born to a Lady Basilissa (or Vasilisa). Scholars such as Gavril LucaLuca, pp. 56‚Äì57. and »òtefan S. GoroveiGorovei (2014), p. 256. dismiss this as a legend. By 1638, although frail and viewed as an infirm, Ioan Coci was groomed to take over as Prince of Wallachia. This plan was curbed by Wallachia's Matei Basarab, who became bitter rivals with Prince Vasile.Gane, pp. 256‚Äì258. Both Ioan and his mother were dead by 1640.Gane, p. 258; Luca, pp. 55, 56. As argued by Gane, Prince Vasile then married his anonymous daughter to Giovanni Antonio Grillo, who was Dragoman for the Republic of Venice (and a relative of Angelo Grillo). The father- and son-in-law were enemies by 1648, when Grillo was sent to a Moldavian prison; he and his wife probably left the country together.Gane, pp. 274‚Äì277. According to Luca, this account relies on an error by, or mistranslation from, Paul of Aleppo. The narrative, he argues, refers to Ruxandra's early life, and the marriage it describes was in fact an engagement.Luca, pp. 54‚Äì55, 57. In 1652, Ruxandra was married off to Tymofiy Khmelnytsky of the Cossack Hetmanate. Khmelnytsky's support was crucial in Moldavia's subsequent clash with Wallachia, but defeat in that conflict resulted in his death and in Lupu's dethronement.Gane, pp. 263‚Äì271, 288‚Äì301, 309; Luca, pp. 59‚Äì61. She opted to live in Cossack Podolia, at Rashkiv (Ra»ôcov) and Yampil. She married a second time, to Andriy Antonovsky, a member of the Hetmanate's starshyna‚Äîwhen he died, Ruxandra came under the watch of her former brother-in-law, Yurii Khmelnytsky, who reportedly treated her as his hostage.Luca, p. 61. In 1658, her half-brother, »òtefƒÉni»õƒÉ Lupu, who had managed to obtain the Moldavian throne, besieged Rashkiv, hoping to kidnap Ruxandra.Gane, p. 301; Luca, p. 61. In 1644, after a lengthy dispute between Vasile and his boyars,Lupu, pp. 277‚Äì283. Maria Coci had become the wife of Janusz Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç, the Grand Hetman of Lithuania. She was noted as the patron of the Orthodox church in Kƒódainiai.Zabolotnaia, pp. 9‚Äì15. Maria died a childless widow in Slutsk, having for long been engaged in a patrimonial dispute with her tutor, Bogus≈Çaw Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç. Following her death, the dispute was taken up by Ruxandra and »òtefƒÉni»õƒÉ.Zabolotnaia, pp. 15‚Äì24. The latter also died, in 1662, while Ruxandra survived for 25 more years, the last of which were spent in Moldavia, either at Deleni or at Preute»ôti.Gane, pp. 302‚Äì303; Luca, pp. 61‚Äì70, 75‚Äì77. She was killed there in 1687, during another Polish invasion of Moldavia, by Cossacks who failed to recognize her, or were only interested in her wealth.Gane, pp. 302‚Äì303; Luca, pp. 66‚Äì70. Other echoes Before its demise in 1653, the Lupu regime had promoted Coste's grandson, Coste (or Costache) Mo»õoc, who began his career as P√¢rcƒÉlab of Hotin.Luca, p. 62, 72, 73, 75; Stoicescu, p. 419. Buhu»ô was another of Lupu's trusted boyars, as was his son (and Costea's grandnephew), generally known by the maternal surname, as Miron BƒÉcioc.Stoicescu, pp. 355, 357. See also Bacalov, pp. 325‚Äì326; Rosetti, p. 215. Miron's sister, Anastasia Buhu»ô, married George Ducas and became the Princess-consort in 1665.Stoicescu, pp. 355, 397, 450. Through his mother Catinca »òoldan, the Spatharios Iordache Todera»ôco Cantacuzino was another close ally of the Coci family, viewing himself as Ruxandra's cousin and Costea's nephew.Stoicescu, pp. 21, 365. One branch of the Cantacuzinos was named after the estate of Deleni, which they had inherited from the Buciocs and the Cocis.Bacalov, pp. 340‚Äì341, 459; Luca, pp. 63, 65‚Äì66, 69‚Äì70, 75. See also Botezatu, p. 24. Also as a result of their connection to Costea, the Deleanus owned Ru»ôii and half of Horodnici, in Bukovina, as well as, possibly, parts of NƒÉv√Ærne»õ.Bacalov, pp. 340‚Äì341, 459. The MƒÉlai family inherited the former village of Pi»ôcani, in Ia»ôi County, which in February 1657 they sold to the Mo»õocs, whom they still viewed as their kin, through Costea.Rosetti, p. 197. Bucioc's life and its retelling by Costin have also left traces in modern Romanian literature. In 1867, Bucioc's story was revisited by V. A. Urechia, who rewrote it as a drama, or melodrama,\\"Romania\\", in Martin Banham (ed.), The Cambridge Guide to Theatre, p. 934. Cambridge etc.: Cambridge University Press, 2000. eponymously called Vornicul Bucioc. In this retelling, Graziani is the \\"evil genius of tragedy rather than drama\\",Constan»õia Dunca, \\"Vornicul≈≠ Bucioc≈≠. DramƒÉ √Æn 5 acte de d. B. Alessandrescu UrechiƒÉ\\", in Romanulu, April 6, 1867, p. 287. secretly in love with Bucioc's virtuous wife, referred to as \\"Irina\\". His penchant for corruption allows two of Bucioc's boyar rivals, »òeptilici and Goia, to maneuver against the Vornic, and ultimately to frame him; his arrest sparks a popular revolt, prompting Graziani to release him, but then to also try and poison him.Spectator, \\"SƒïptƒÉm√¢na teatralƒÉ\\", in Foaia PopularƒÉ, Nr. 41/1898, p. 5. When this fails, »òeptilici and Goia attempt to murder Bucioc during an archery contest, but only manage to kill Irina. The climax of the play is provided by the Ottoman invasion, which surprises both the Prince and the Vornic, who are then taken to their deaths. In the final scene, \\"Bucioc heads for the stake to protect his prince, sacrificing a revenge at hand to save his motherland\\". Urechia's version was first produced for the National Theater Bucharest by »òtefan Vellescu, who also starred in it, and was remembered as one of Vellescu's \\"greatest hits\\".Ion Livescu, Amintiri »ôi scrieri despre teatru, p. 14. Bucharest: Editura pentru literaturƒÉ, 1967. Feminist writer Constan»õa Dunca Schaiu immediately saluted it as a \\"manifestation against pessimism\\" which allowed Romania to consider herself \\"an oriental France\\". She viewed Irina as a prototype of the \\"great woman\\", realistic in that she loves her husband more than her country, and in that she \\"needs her servants for encouragement.\\" Ten years late, in 1877, Ghimpele newspaper argued that the play had made Urechia \\"one of [Romania's] greatest writers.\\"Neagu, \\"√âr≈≠ noua direc»õie, sughi»õ≈≠ la bota rece ca pricops√©lƒÉ\\", in Ghimpele, Nr. 17/1877, p. 3. The enthusiasm declined sharply in later decades. As noted by critic Ioan Massoff, Vornicul Bucioc stirred up \\"something like a popular movement\\" on its premiere, but, by 1900, \\"none of [Urechia's] plays was even being produced\\".Ioan Massoff, Istoria Teatrului Na»õional din Bucure»ôti: 1877‚Äî1937, p. 127.

It is located at 22 Church Street, only 500 feet from the Delaware River. It is one of the earliest and last riverfront churches in Pennsylvania. The cemetery at St. Martin's Church contains a memorial commemorating war veterans from the Revolutionary War, the War of 1812, the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War, the American Civil War, and the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War who are buried in the cemetery. History St. Martin's Church was founded in 1699 by Walter Martin of Upper Chichester, Pennsylvania as an alternative place of worship and burial for non-Quakers. Martin was a Quaker, however he became embittered against the \\"Religious Society of Friends\\". On December 18, 1699, Martin donated one and half acres of land to the town and inhabitants of Marcus Hook for a church and burial place. In the deed, he included the restriction that \\"Quakers and reputed Quakers only excepted\\". The church was originally named the Chapel at Chichester. In 1702, a rude frame building that was previously used as a blacksmith shop was purchased for 5 pounds, moved to the church property and church services began. St. Martin's Church was originally part of the parish of St. Paul's in Chester, Pennsylvania along with St. John's Church in Concord, Pennsylvania.. In 1704, Reverend Henry Nichols was sent by The Society of the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts to preach in all three churches. Missionaries were sent from Philadelphia to preach to the congregation, however problems arose due to the distance the preachers had to travel and the church began to have ministers from the Swedish Church in Wilmington, Delaware preside over the congregation. By 1745 the congregation had outgrown the original, old frame building and funds were raised to build a small brick church approximately 12 feet by 16 feet. The old frame church building remained on the property and was used as the first school in Marcus Hook. The school remained open until 1860 when a new brick schoolhouse was built elsewhere and the old frame church building was demolished. In 1760, the church name was changed from Chapel at Chichester to St. Martin's in honor of the founder Walter Martin at the suggestion of Emmanuel Grubb, son of John Grubb, a two-term member of the Pennsylvania Provincial Assembly and one of the original settlers of the Brandywine Hundred which became Claymont, Delaware. In 1822, St. Martin's Church separated from St. Paul's parish of Chester and became a separate organization. In 1845, the church was rebuilt with the current building. In 1967, the parishioners outgrew the church and built a new place of worship at 700 Meetinghouse Road in Boothwyn, Pennsylvania. In 1979, the church was designated a Local Historic Landmark by the Marcus Hook Borough Council. In 1985, the church and cemetery were obtained by The Marcus Hook Community Development Corporation and renovated to be historically accurate. The building has been leased out to different church congregations and is currently used by the Bible Presbyterian Church of Marcus Hook. Cemetery The cemetery at St. Martin's Church contains about 500 graves dating as far back as the 1700s. Soldier and Sailor Walk Memorial Soldier and Sailor Walk Memorial at St. Martin's Church in Marcus Hook, PA At the cemetery's back end is the Soldier and Sailors Walk Memorial commemorating 73 soldiers buried in the cemetery. The memorial was dedicated on May 24, 2003 by the Marcus Hook Community Development Corporation.

When he learned that CBS acquired the rights to Gleason's life story, Garrett personally lobbied to the network to portray the role. Initially, CBS offered the part of Gleason to Mark Addy. However, Addy dropped out due to scheduling conflicts, thus Garrett was officially cast as Gleason. Garrett reportedly disapproved of the script written by Rick Podell and Michael Preminger. With assistance from Deutch, Garrett and his writer friend Dave Boone wrote an uncredited rewrite of the script. Garrett and Deutch paid Greg Cannom with their own money for him to apply for the makeup needed for Garrett to look like Gleason. It took Garrett three hours to put on the makeup and an hour and a half to take it off. Unlike Gleason, who was 5 feet 11 in real life, Garrett was 6 feet 8 at the time of filming; in order for Garrett to appear as if he were 5 feet 11, the other cast members wore boots with seven-inch lifts and the doorways on the set were built at 8 feet rather than the usual 6 feet 9. The film was shot in Montreal. Accolades For his performance, Garrett was nominated for both the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Limited Series or Movie and the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Miniseries or Television Movie.

Murray is Professor of Psychology at the University at Buffalo, State University of New York. She is a social psychologist known for her work on close relationships and their trajectories over time. Murray received the American Psychological Association Award for Distinguished Scientific Early Career Contributions to Psychology (Area: Social Psychology) in 2003 for \\"distinguished and original contributions to an understanding of motivated social cognition in relationships.\\" Other awards include the New Contribution Award from the International Society for the Study of Personal Relationships in 1998 and 2000, the Outstanding Early Career Award from the International Society for Self and Identity in 2000, the Career Trajectory Award from the Society of Experimental Social Psychology in 2012,, the Mid-Career Distinguished Contribution Award from the International Association for Relationship Research in 2016, and the SUNY Chancellor‚Äôs Award for Excellence in Scholarship and Creative Activities in 2020http://www.buffalo.edu/ubnow/stories/2020/08/chancellors-awards.html. Murray received the Wegner Theoretical Innovation Award from the Society for Personality and Social Psychology in 2007 for collaborative work with John G. Holmes and Nancy Collins. Their theoretical paper titled Optimizing Assurance: The Risk Regulation System in Relationships provided a model of how people cope with the perceived risks of romantic relationships by balancing the need for intimacy and closeness with the need to minimize the risk of experiencing the pain of rejection. She and John Holmes are co-authors of the book Interdependent minds: The dynamics of close relationships, which is part of a book series on ‚ÄúDistinguished Contributions in Psychology‚Äù edited by Susan Fiske. This book introduces a motivation management model for understanding how romantic partners accommodate each other's needs for commitment, reciprocity, and responsiveness, and establish habitual ways of relating to one another. Murray and Holmes also authored the book Motivated cognition in relationships.  Biography  Murray attended graduate school at the University at Waterloo in Canada where she received her Ph.D. in Psychology and began her long-term collaboration with Holmes. She completed a post- doctoral fellowship at the Research Center for Group Dynamics at the University of Michigan where she collaborated with Richard Gonzalez. Murray subsequently joined the faculty of the Department of Psychology at University at Buffalo where she directs the Interpersonal Processes Laboratory. Murray's research program has been supported by various agencies including the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada, the National Science Foundation, and the National Institute of Mental Health. Murray served as Associate Editor at the Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, and Personality and Social Psychology Review.  Research  Murray examines motivated reasoning, i.e., emotion- biased decision-making, in close relationships. Much of her work has focused on issues pertaining to trust, commitment, satisfaction, and self-esteem in romantic relationships, and the thoughts, feelings, and behaviors of the individuals involved and its effect on their relationships. Murray and her colleagues have explored whether having an idealized view of one's romantic partner contributes to relationship satisfaction or whether it might set people up for disappointment. In one of their studies, participants were asked to rate their own interpersonal attributes as well as their partners. Participants often tended to view their partners in a more favorable manner than their partners viewed themselves. The authors suggested that a certain degree of idealization in one's partner is almost crucial for dating and marital satisfaction. If people view their partners in a more positive way, this can help maintain their confidence in the relationships, even after they have exhibited some doubt. Other research has examined how self-esteem may impact the quality of romantic relationships. In one study, couples completed various measures which assessed their sense of self worth and how they perceived their partner, their partner's love for them, and the quality of their relationship. The findings indicated cascading effects of negative self- esteem on relationship quality. Individuals who struggled with self-doubt carried their uncertainty into their relationships and underrated their partner's love; this led to less favorable views of the partner, less satisfaction with the relationship, and more pessimistic views of its future than warranted by their partner's thoughts and feelings. Individuals with low self-worth may find themselves in unsuccessful relationships because of their inability to believe that someone who is worth it will be able to love them, and their inability to be positive about their future together. Murray and her colleagues suggest that loving and supportive partners can reassure such individuals of their love and even fade their insecurities to establish a closer and more satisfying relationship.

It was then sung with an older melody by Martin Luther, but a melody which was likelyBernhard Leube. \\"Das Kind und das Ich: Warum 'Ich steh an deiner Krippen hier' zu den sch√∂nsten Weihnachtsliedern z√§hlt\\" in Sonntagsblatt: 360 Grad evangelisch No. 51/2008. M√ºnchen, 21 December 2008 created by Johann Sebastian Bach for Georg Christian Schemelli's Musicalisches Gesang-Buch of 1736 is now part of current Protestant and Catholic hymnals.  History  The Lutheran theologian and minister Paul Gerhardt wrote the text of 15 stanzas. It was first published in the fifth edition of Johann Cr√ºger's hymnal Praxis Pietatis Melica in 1653. It was first a song of individual reflection and devotion, which became part of congregational singing only later, such as in 1709 in the hymnal Geistliche und Liebliche Lieder by Johann Porst. In Germany, it is present in both the current Protestant (Evangelisches Gesangbuch)EG 37, with nine stanzas (1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 10, 11, 13 and 14) and Catholic hymnals (Gotteslob).GL 256 in four stanzas (1, 3, 4 and 5). It is also part of several other hymnals and song books.  Text  The text of the original stanzas 1, 3, 4 and 5 is given, as in the Protestant and Catholic hymnals:  Tunes and settings  Johannes Zahn listed eight hymn tunes which were specifically composed for \\"\\" and which originated or were first published between 1667 and 1883 (Zahn 4659‚Äì4666). One of these melodies, Zahn 4663, was first published as No. 195 in Schemellis Gesangbuch in 1736. Luther composed two hymn tunes for \\"Nun freut euch lieben Christen\\": the Praxis Pietatis Melica of 1653 specifies the second of these, the one that was published in the Klugsches Gesangbuch, as melody for Gerhardt's text. The hymn was published with the \\"Nun freut euch lieben Christen\\" tune in the Gotteslob of 1975. In the Gotteslob of 2013 it was published with the melody from Schemellis Gesangbuch as GL 256 in the common section, with . The older tune has been retained in regional sections, for example GL 758 in the Gotteslob of the Diocese of Limburg. \\"Nun freut euch lieben Christen\\" melody The first print gives the melody of \\"Nun freut euch lieben Christen\\", a melody by Martin Luther which was also used for \\"Es ist gewisslich an der Zeit\\" (EG 149). This melody, Zahn 4429a, appears in older hymnals, and in the Epiphany part of Johann Sebastian Bach's Christmas Oratorio, composed for the Christmas season of 1734‚Äì1735.Luke Dahn. BWV 248(6).59(6) at . 2017 Inserted in the narration of the Three Kings, the first stanza refers to them bringing gold, incense and myrrh, thus offering what the singer has to give, spirit and mind, heart, soul and courage (\\"mein Geist und Sinn, Herz, Seel und Mut\\"). Melody in Schemellis Gesangbuch In 1736, Georg Christian Schemelli published in Leipzig a Musicalisches Gesang-Buch (Musical song book). Bach probably composed for this edition a melody in C minor which was intended for private devotion and solo singing. The Bach- Gesellschaft republished this setting of the song in 1892.Franz W√ºllner (editor). \\"Ich steh' an deiner Krippen hier\\", p. 292 in Part II of Motetten, Chor√§le und Lieder, Vol. 39 of Bach-Gesellschaft Ausgabe.

Al Gore was the 45th Vice President of the United States, being twice elected alongside Bill Clinton in 1992 and 1996. Campaign Although Gore had opted out of running for president (due to the healing process his son was undergoing after a car accident), he accepted the request of Bill Clinton to be his running mate in the 1992 United States presidential election on July 10, 1992. Clinton's choice was perceived as unconventional (as rather than pick a running mate who would diversify the ticket, Clinton chose a fellow Southerner who was close in age) and was criticized by some. Clinton stated that he chose Gore for his foreign policy experience, work with the environment, and commitment to his family. Known as the Baby Boomer Ticket and the Fortysomething Team, The New York Times noted that if elected, Clinton (who was 45) Gore (who was 44) would be the \\"youngest team to make it to the White House in the country's history.\\" Theirs was the first ticket since 1972 to try to capture the youth vote, a ticket which Gore referred to as \\"a new generation of leadership.\\" The ticket increased in popularity after the candidates traveled with their wives, Hillary and Tipper, on a \\"six-day, 1,000-mile bus ride, from New York to St. Louis.\\" Gore also successfully debated against the other vice presidential candidates, Dan Quayle (a longtime colleague from the House and the Senate) and James Stockdale. The result of the campaign was a win by the Clinton-Gore ticket (43%) over the Bush-Quayle ticket (38%). Clinton and Gore were inaugurated on January 20, 1993 and were re-elected to a second term in the 1996 election. Economy and information technology Vice President Gore with President Bill Clinton walking along a colonnade at the White House Under the Clinton Administration, the U.S. economy expanded, according to David Greenberg (professor of history and media studies at Rutgers University) who argued that \\"by the end of the Clinton presidency, the numbers were uniformly impressive. Besides the record-high surpluses and the record-low poverty rates, the economy could boast the longest economic expansion in history; the lowest unemployment since the early 1970s; and the lowest poverty rates for single mothers, black Americans, and the aged.\\" In addition, one of Gore's major works as Vice President was the National Performance Review,Announcement of National Performance Review which pointed out waste, fraud, and other abuse in the federal government and stressed the need for cutting the size of the bureaucracy and the number of regulations. Gore stated that the National Performance Review later helped guide President Clinton when he downsized the federal government.Speech by Vice President Gore: International Reinventing Government Conference. January 14, 1999\\" The economic success of this administration was due in part to Gore's continued role as an Atari Democrat, promoting the development of information technology, which led to the dot-com boom (c. 1995-2001). Clinton and Gore entered office planning to finance research that would \\"flood the economy with innovative goods and services, lifting the general level of prosperity and strengthening American industry.\\" Their overall aim was to fund the development of, \\"robotics, smart roads, biotechnology, machine tools, magnetic-levitation trains, fiber-optic communications and national computer networks. Also earmarked [were] a raft of basic technologies like digital imaging and data storage.\\" These initiatives met with skepticism from critics who claimed that their initiatives would \\"backfire, bloating Congressional pork and creating whole new categories of Federal waste.\\" During the election and while Vice President, Gore popularized the term Information Superhighway (which became synonymous with the internet) and was involved in the creation of the National Information Infrastructure. The economic initiatives introduced by the Clinton-Gore administration linked to information technology were a primary focus for Gore during his time as Vice President. Gary Stix commented on these initiatives a few months prior in his May 1993 article for Scientific American, \\"Gigabit Gestalt: Clinton and Gore embrace an activist technology policy.\\" Stix described them as a \\"distinct statement about where the new administration stands on the matter of technology ... gone is the ambivalence or outright hostility toward government involvement in little beyond basic science.\\" Campbell-Kelly and Aspray further note in Computer: A History of the Information Machine: > In the early 1990s the Internet was big news. ... In the fall of 1990 there > were just 313,000 computers on the Internet; by 1996, there were close to 10 > million. The networking idea became politicized during the 1992 Clinton-Gore > election campaign, where the rhetoric of the Information > Superhighwayinformation highway captured the public imagination. On taking > office in 1993, the new administration set in place a range of government > initiatives for a National Information Infrastructure aimed at ensuring that > all American citizens ultimately gain access to the new networks.Campbell- > Kelly and Aspray (1996). Computer: A History of the Information Machine. New > York: BasicBooks, 283 These initiatives were discussed in a number of venues. Howard Rheingold argued in The Virtual Community: Homesteading on the Electronic Frontier, that these initiatives played a critical role in the development of digital technology, stating that, \\"Two powerful forces drove the rapid emergence of the superhighway notion in 1994 ... the second driving force behind the superhighway idea continued to be Vice-President Gore.\\" In addition, Clinton and Gore submitted the report, Science in the National Interest in 1994, which further outlined their plans to develop science and technology in the United States. Gore also discussed these plans in speeches that he made at The Superhighway Summit at UCLA and for the International Telecommunications Union. On January 13, 1994 Gore \\"became the first U.S. vice president to hold a live interactive news conference on an international computer network\\". Gore was also asked to write the foreword to the 1994 internet guide, The Internet Companion: A Beginner's Guide to Global Networking (2nd edition) by Tracy LaQuey. In the foreword he stated the following: > Since I first became interested in high-speed networking almost seventeen > years ago, there have been many major advances both in the technology and in > public awareness. Articles on high-speed networks are commonplace in major > newspapers and in news magazines. In contrast, when as a House member in the > early 1980s, I called for creation of a national network of \\"information > superhighways,\\" the only people interested were the manufacturers of optical > fiber. Back then, of course, high-speed meant 56,000 bits per second. Today > we are building a national information infrastructure that will carry > billions of bits of data per second, serve thousands of users > simultaneously, and transmit not only electronic mail and data files but > voice and video as well. The Clinton-Gore administration launched the first official White House website on October 21, 1994. It would be followed by three more versions, resulting in the final edition launched in 2000. The White House website was part of a general movement by this administration towards web based communication: \\"Clinton and Gore were responsible for pressing almost all federal agencies, the U.S. court system and the U.S. military onto the Internet, thus opening up America's government to more of America's citizens than ever before. On July 17, 1996. President Clinton issued Executive Order 13011 - Federal Information Technology, ordering the heads of all federal agencies to fully utilize information technology to make the information of the agency easily accessible to the public.\\" Clipper Chip The Clipper Chip, which \\"Clinton inherited from a multi-year National Security Agency effort,\\" was a method of hardware encryption with a government backdoor. In 1994, Vice President Gore issued a memo on the topic of encryption which stated that under a new policy the White House would \\"provide better encryption to individuals and businesses while ensuring that the needs of law enforcement and national security are met. Encryption is a law and order issue since it can be used by criminals to thwart wiretaps and avoid detection and prosecution.\\" STATEMENT OF THE VICE PRESIDENT Another initiative proposed a software-based key escrow system, in which keys to all encrypted data and communications would reside with a trusted third party. Since the government was seen as possibly having a need to access encrypted data originating in other countries, the pressure to establish such a system was worldwide.Commercial Policy These policies met with strong opposition from civil liberty groups such as the American Civil Liberties Union and the Electronic Privacy Information Center, scientific groups such as the National Research Council,Press release leading cryptographers,The Risks of Key Recovery, Key Escrow, & Trusted Third Party Encryption and the European Commission.\\"Europeans Reject U.S. Plan On Electronic Cryptography\\" All three Clipper Chip initiatives thus failed to gain widespread acceptance by consumers or support from the industry.The Clipper Chip The ability of a proposal such as the Clipper Chip to meet the stated goals, especially that of enabling better encryption to individuals, was disputed by a number of experts.Crypto Experts Letter By 1996, the Clipper Chip was abandoned.Rendering Unto CESA Additional projects President Bill Clinton installing computer cables with Vice President Al Gore on NetDay at Ygnacio Valley High School in Concord, CA. March 9, 1996. Gore had discussed his concerns with computer technology and levels of access in his 1994 article, \\"No More Information Have and Have Nots.\\" He was particularly interested in implementing measures which would grant all children access to the Internet, stating: Gore had a chance to fulfill this promise when he and President Clinton participated in John Gage's NetDay'96 on March 9, 1996. Clinton and Gore spent the day at Ygnacio Valley High School, as part of the drive to connect California public schools to the Internet. In a speech given at YVH, Clinton stated that he was excited to see that his challenge the previous September to \\"Californians to connect at least 20 percent of your schools to the Information Superhighway by the end of this school year\\" was met. Clinton also described this event as part of a time of \\"absolutely astonishing transformation; a moment of great possibility. All of you know that the information and technology explosion will offer to you and to the young people of the future more opportunities and challenges than any generation of Americans has ever seen.\\" In a prepared statement, Gore added that NetDay was part of one of the major goals of the Clinton administration, which was \\"to give every child in America access to high quality educational technology by the dawn of the new century.\\" Gore also stated that the administration planned \\"to connect every classroom to the Internet by the year 2000.\\" On April 28, 1998, Gore honored numerous volunteers who had been involved with NetDay and \\"who helped connect students to the Internet in 700 of the poorest schools in the country\\" via \\"an interactive online session with children across the country.\\" He also reinforced the impact of the Internet on the environment, education, and increased communication between people through his involvement with \\"the largest one-day online event\\" for that time, 24 Hours in Cyberspace. The event took place on February 8, 1996 and Second Lady Tipper Gore also participated, acting as one of the event's 150 photographers.Picture This:Tipper Gore, Photojournalist Gore contributed the introductory essay to the Earthwatch section of the website,Earthwatch: 24 Hours in Cyberspace arguing that: Gore was involved in a number of other projects related to digital technology. He expressed his concerns for online privacy through his 1998 \\"Electronic Bill of Rights\\" speech in which he stated: \\"We need an electronic bill of rights for this electronic age ... You should have the right to choose whether your personal information is disclosed.\\" VICE PRESIDENT GORE ANNOUNCES NEW STEPS TOWARD AN ELECTRONIC BILL OF RIGHTS He also began promoting a NASA satellite that would provide a constant view of Earth, marking the first time such an image would have been made since The Blue Marble photo from the 1972 Apollo 17 mission. The \\"Triana\\" satellite would have been permanently mounted in the L1 Lagrangian Point, 1.5 million km away. Gore also became associated with Digital Earth. Environment Gore was also involved in a number of initiatives related to the environment. He launched the GLOBE program on Earth Day'94, an education and science activity that, according to Forbes magazine, \\"made extensive use of the Internet to increase student awareness of their environment\\". During the late 1990s, Gore strongly pushed for the passage of the Kyoto Protocol, which called for reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. Gore was opposed by the Senate, which passed unanimously (95-0) the Byrd‚ÄìHagel Resolution (S. Res. 98). In 1998, Gore began promoting a NASA satellite that would provide a constant view of Earth, marking the first time such an image would have been made since The Blue Marble photo from the 1972 Apollo 17 mission. During this time, he also became associated with Digital Earth. Fund-raising National Peace Officers' Memorial Service In 1996, Gore was criticized for attending an event at the Buddhist Hsi Lai Temple in Hacienda Heights, California. In an interview on NBC's Today the following year, he stated that, \\"I did not know that it was a fund-raiser. I knew it was a political event, and I knew there were finance people that were going to be present, and so that alone should have told me, 'This is inappropriate and this is a mistake; don't do this.' And I take responsibility for that. It was a mistake.\\"\\"Gore Admits Temple Fund-Raiser Was A 'Mistake'\\", CNN.com, January 24, 1997 The temple was later implicated in a campaign donation laundering scheme. In that scheme, donations nominally from Buddhist nuns in lawful amounts had actually been donated by wealthy monastics and devotees. Robert Conrad, Jr., then head of a Justice Department task force appointed by Attorney General Janet Reno to investigate the fund-raising controversies, called on Reno in Spring 2000 to appoint an independent counsel to look into the fund-raising practices of Vice President Gore. Reno on September 3, 1997, ordered a review of Gore's fund-raising and associated statements. Based on the investigation, she judged that appointment of an independent counsel was unwarranted.Fund-raising Investigation Discussion, NewsHour with Jim Lehrer, transcript, PBS, June 23, 2000, Retrieved: April 14, 2006 Later in 1997, Gore also had to explain certain fund-raising calls he made to solicit funds for the Democratic Party for the 1996 election.\\"Fund- Raising Questions Focus On Gore\\", CNN \\"AllPolitics,\\" March 2, 1997, Retrieved: October 15, 2007 In a news conference, Gore responded that, \\"all calls that I made were charged to the Democratic National Committee. I was advised there was nothing wrong with that. My counsel tells me there is no controlling legal authority that says that is any violation of any law.\\"As quoted in \\"The Money Trail\\", NewsHour with Jim Lehrer, transcript, PBS, March 6, 1997, Retrieved: October 15, 2007 The phrase \\"no controlling legal authority\\" was severely criticized by some commentators, such as Charles Krauthammer, who wrote that \\"Whatever other legacies Al Gore leaves behind between now and retirement, he forever bequeaths this newest weasel word to the lexicon of American political corruption.\\"Charles Krauthammer, \\"Gore's Meltdown\\", Washington Post, March 7, 1997, Retrieved: October 15, 2007 On the other hand, Robert L. Weinberg argued in The Nation in 2000 that Gore actually had the U.S. Constitution in his favor on this, although he did concede that Gore's \\"use of the phrase was judged by many commentators to have been a political mistake of the first order\\" and noted that it was used often in stump speeches by George W. Bush when Bush was campaigning against Gore in that year's presidential race.Robert L. Weinberg, \\"Controlling Authority\\", The Nation, October 16, 2000, Retrieved: October 15, 2007 Impeachment and impact Soon afterwards, Gore contended with the Lewinsky scandal, involving an affair between President Clinton and an intern, Monica Lewinsky. Gore initially defended Clinton, whom he believed to be innocent, stating, \\"He is the president of the country! He is my friend ... I want to ask you now, every single one of you, to join me in supporting him.\\" After Clinton was impeached Gore continued to defend him stating, \\"I've defined my job in exactly the same way for six years now ... to do everything I can to help him be the best president possible.\\" However, by the beginning stages of the 2000 Presidential election, Gore gradually distanced himself from Clinton. Clinton was not a part of Gore's campaign, a move also signaled by the choice of Joe Lieberman as a running mate, as Lieberman had been highly critical of Clinton's conduct.

The team currently plays in the Peruvian Primera Divisi√≥n. History  Founding  The club was founded on December 18, 2010, by the mayor of the Desaguadero District, Juan Carlos Aquino, under the name Club Deportivo Binacional de Desaguadero. The district is close to the Peru‚ÄìBolivia border and thus was called Binacional, or Bi-national in English.  Copa Per√∫  The club debuted in the Liga Superior de Puno of the 2011 Copa Per√∫ tournament and finished fourth in the standings with 14 points. The following year, the club finished second in the Liga Superior de Puno with 21 points and advanced to the Departmental Stage where it also finished second, thus allowing them to advance to the Regional Stage. Binacional became the Region VIII champions after finishing the first of its group and beating Alfonso Ugarte from Puno in the regional finals on penalties after a 0‚Äì0 draw. They proceeded to play in the National Stage. In the Round of 16, Binacional defeated Deportivo CREDICOOP from Tacna on penalties after an aggregate score of 3‚Äì3. However, the Peruvian Football Federation's Justice Court retired the team from the tournament for fielding Jos√© Antonio Balarezo D√°vila in the Regional Stage, who was suspended after receiving a red card in the last game of the Departmental Stage. Binacional repeated a similar campaign in 2013. The club qualified to the Regional Stage and finished the first of its group of Region VIII. In the National Stage, they faced San Sim√≥n from Moquegua in the Round of 16. They won the first leg 1‚Äì0 but lost the second leg 0‚Äì2, thus eliminating them from the tournament with an aggregate score of 1‚Äì2. San Sim√≥n eventually advanced to the finals and would go on to win the tournament. In 2014, Binacional reached the Regional Stage for the third year in a row. They finished third of their group with 7 points, behind Uni√≥n Alto Huarca from Cusco and Uni√≥n Fuerza Minera from Puno and were not able to advance to the National Stage. Later on, Fuerza Minera would become the runner-up of the tournament. The Copa Per√∫ restructured its format for the 2015 season. This year Binacional was eliminated in the Departmental Stage after Policial Santa Rosa from Puno defeated them on a 1‚Äì2 aggregate score. Binacional switched its locality to the Paucarpata District in the Arequipa Region in 2016, on the orders of the club president, Juan Carlos Aquino. The team purchased the playing rights of Escuela Municipal de Paucarpata, who participated in the Liga Distrital de Paucarpata. As part of the merger, the club changed its official name to Escuela Municipal Deportivo Binacional. That year, Binacional started its campaign winning 8 out of 9 games of the Liga Distrital de Paucarpata, scoring 70 goals and finishing first place in the standings with Luis 'Puchito' Flores as head coach. It then surpassed the Regional and Departmental stages without difficulty to reach the National Stage as Arequipa Region's runner-up. In this stage, the team won 4 games and tied 2 to finish second in the overall league standings of 50 participants and thus qualifying to the Round of 16. In this round, Binacional faced against Octavio Espinosa from Ica, winning the first leg 2‚Äì1 and the second leg 3‚Äì1 to advance to the quarter-final with an aggregate score of 5‚Äì2. Then, the team beat Carlos Orellana, also from Ica, with a 6‚Äì4 global score after winning 6‚Äì3 on the first leg of this round and losing 0‚Äì1 in the second leg, allowing them to play the final group stage or La Final√≠sima in Lima as one of the four best Peruvian amateur teams. It surprisingly lost 1‚Äì0 in the first match of this stage to the eventual fourth-place team Racing from Huamachuco. The second game was against eventual champion Sport Rosario from Huaraz which it lost 2‚Äì3 with an own goal by Carlos Aspilcueta at the 73rd minute. The team finished 3rd overall after beating Deportivo Hualgayoc by 1‚Äì0 and thus preventing it from winning the tournament.  Promotion to first division  Binacional had a great start to its 2017 campaign by qualifying to the departmental stage of the Copa Per√∫ and winning all of its matches to qualify to the National Stage. In the first round of this stage, the team won four games, tied one, and lost one and placed twelfth in the standings out of 50 teams. This allowed them to play the second round where they faced against Le√≥n de Hu√°nuco for a spot in the Round of 16. Binacional won both legs, 3‚Äì1 away in Hu√°nuco and 8‚Äì1 at home in Arequipa for a global score of 11‚Äì2. In the Round of 16, Binacional faced against the Lima Region champion, Defensor Laure Sur. They won the first leg 4‚Äì0 and lost the second leg 1‚Äì2, thus advancing to the quarter-finals with a global score of 5‚Äì1. Then, they played against Ica Region representative Uni√≥n San Mart√≠n. The teams tied in the first leg with a score of 1‚Äì1 but Binacional was able to win on the second leg 4‚Äì1 and to reach La Final√≠sima once again. Their first game was a 4‚Äì1 victory against Jos√© Carlos Mari√°tegui from Tarapoto. It then tied 1‚Äì1 against tournament favorite Atl√©tico Grau from Piura. This left both Atl√©tico Grau and Binacional with the same number of points going into the last matchday. On the last matchday, Binacional won 1‚Äì0 against Estudiantil CNI from Iquitos and Atletico Grau was able to defeat Jos√© Carlos Mari√°tegui. However, Binacional managed a better goal difference of +5 compared to Grau's +3. As such, El Poderoso won the tournament and promotion to the 2018 Torneo Descentralizado.  Professional era  Deportivo Binacional debuted in the Peruvian first division in the first tournament of the season, the 2018 Torneo de Verano. The first match for the recently promoted club was a 0‚Äì2 loss against Cantolao. The next matchday saw the team beat Uni√≥n Comercio 2‚Äì1 in Moyobamba, in which Milton Ben√≠tez scored the first goal for Binacional and an own goal from Comercio's defender secured the club's first victory in Peruvian first division. At the end of the tournament, Binacional had won 5 matches, tied 6, and lost 3 to finish third of its group with 21 points. Before the start of the 2018 Torneo Apertura, the team temporarily moved to Moquegua's Estadio 25 de Noviembre in an effort to attract more fans. By the end of the Torneo Apertura, the club was undefeated at this new location, winning 5 matches and tying 3. Binacional finished eighth in the standings with 23 points. Then, the team had a rough start in the 2018 Torneo Clausura which resulted in the release of head coach Luis 'Puchito' Flores. He was replaced by Mario Flores ahead of matchday 8 of the tournament, when the team was sitting at the bottom of the league table. Binacional managed to finish the tournament thirdteen in the standings with 17 points. In the aggregate table, the team placed eighth with 59 points and gained a berth for the 2019 Copa Sudamericana. After the end of the 2018 season, the club announced that they would be moving back to the Puno Region permanently, as well as modifying their badge to include a flag of Puno and reverting to its original name Deportivo Binacional. It enrolled Estadio Guillermo Brice√±o Rosamedina in Juliaca as their new home stadium, at 3824 meters above sea level. However, this stadium did not meet the necessary standards established by CONMEBOL to hold an international match, and therefore El Poderoso was forced to play their home games of the 2019 Copa Sudamericana at the Estadio Monumental de la UNSA in Arequipa. The drawing for this tournament set Binacional to face Independiente from Argentina for the first stage. The club's first game in an international competition was a 1‚Äì4 loss in Avellaneda, with Jeferson Collazos scoring the only goal for El Poderoso. The second leg was also a loss, this time in Arequipa with a 1‚Äì2 score. Binacional was eliminated from the competition with a 2‚Äì6 aggregate score.  Liga 1 champions  Binacional had a successful domestic campaign in 2019 where it won the Torneo Apertura with 36 points, 4 points ahead of its nearer contender, Sporting Cristal. It had an almost perfect run at home scoring 3 goal per game on average and only losing to another high-altitude team, Sport Huancayo. During this time it was led by Peruvian coach Javier Arce, who left the club after the first half of the season because of disagreements with the owners. Some of the most important players for the club during the Torneo Apertura championship campaign were under-23 player Andy Polar, Colombian striker Donald Mill√°n, and Peruvian forward Alda√≠r Rodr√≠guez. Roberto Mosquera took over as the new head coach for the second half of the season. The team finished fourth in the standings of the Torneo Clausura with 28 points and qualified for the tournament semi-finals from which it received a bye into the tournament final after finishing second in the aggregate table with 64 points. This also granted Binacional the opportunity to play the 2020 Copa Libertadores, the most prestigious competition in South American club football, for the first time in its history. On 2 December 2019, a few days before the tournament final, Binacional players Juan Pablo Vergara, Donald Mill√°n, and Jeferson Collazos were involved in an automobile accident while traveling between the cities of Puno and Juliaca. All three players were taken to the nearest hospital from which Mill√°n and Collazos were released a few hours later without any major injuries. Vergara suffered a perforation of the liver by a broken rib, triggering a hemorrhage from which he was not able to recuperate. At 23:25 PET the club announced via social media that Vergara had died from injuries sustained during the accident. The next day the rest of the squad announced its intentions to go on with the tournament final in honor of their deceased teammate. The first leg of the 2019 final was played on December 8 in Juliaca. Binacional won the first match by 4‚Äì1 against Alianza Lima, who finished the game with only 10 players. √Ångel Ojeda, Edson Aubert, Aldair Rodr√≠guez, and Donald Mill√°n scored for the home team. This game was the first to incorporate the use of the video assistant referee (VAR) review system in Peru's professional league. The second leg was played a week later on December 15 in Lima which ended with at 2‚Äì0 in favor of Alianza Lima. Thus Binacional won its first Peruvian Liga 1 championship with a global score of 4‚Äì3. Kits and crest Binacional has used a sky blue shirt and shorts combination since its inception. Their away kit is a darker shade of blue for the shirt and pants. The crest is composed of a parted coat of arms. The bottom of half is a stylized sun above the waves of Lake Titicaca. The top half consisted of the flag of the Arequipa Region. After the team returned to the Puno Region, the top half was changed to the flag of that region. The coat of arms is supported by two Pumas with an Adidas Telstar and three golden stars for a crown.

Life and career Master of Jazz is a black stallion with a blaze on his face. He was sired by A Jazz Man, who was a son of Pride's Generator, and out of the mare Precious Pusher BW, a daughter of the World Grand Champion The Pusher. Master of Jazz was bred by Gus King of Arab, Alabama and foaled on February 28, 2001. He was later sold to Lee Wall and Mike McGartland. He was initially used by Wall as an amateur mount, but by 2005 the two decided he could win in open competition and placed him in training with Jimmy McConnell. Ridden by McConnell, Master of Jazz won stake classes in numerous shows throughout 2006 before entering the Tennessee Walking Horse National Celebration. He won one split of the Stallions 15.2 and Over class, the traditional first test of horses entering the World Grand Championship, but was unable to compete further as the World Grand Championship was cancelled that year. He and McConnell repeated their win of the stallion class in 2007 before going into the World Grand Championship, which they won. In early 2008, Master of Jazz's owners and trainer were honored at a luncheon held by then Tennessee Agriculture Commissioner Ken Givens. The luncheon is an annual event to recognize the impact of the horse industry in Tennessee and included notable horse trainers, breeders and others.

A son, also named John Ralph Hansford Ward (8 April 1852 ‚Äì ) but known as John R. H. Ward, was also a ship's captain. History Hansford Ward Ward was born at Abbotsbury, Dorset, and emigrated to South Australia aboard Lady Lilford, arriving in September 1839. He settled at Glenelg, and gained employment under Thomas Lipson as a crew member for John Anthony's boat, associated with the Glenelg custom house. He was one of Lipson's party at the proclamation of Port Adelaide in 1840. In April 1840, Ward was among the party that accompanied Governor Gawler to explore and chart the Spencer Gulf coast of Eyre Peninsula from Port Lincoln to Franklin Harbor. Also in that party were Thomas Lipson, John Hill, Thomas Burr, and Alfred Hardy. He married Jane Best in August 1840. She was the eldest daughter of J. Richard Best of Hindmarsh, who died on 1 January 1850 from head injuries sustained at the Adelaide racetrack after a viewing platform railing gave way. In 1841 the customs facility at Glenelg was disbanded, and Ward turned to fishing. He founded H. Ward & Co., proprietors of oyster and cray fishing boats, in which business he was involved for about ten years. He also ran the Glenelg Hotel from 1846 to 1850. Cutter O.G. A cutter 20 tons burthen was built by the firm of Henning & Fenden on the banks of the Patawalonga River and in 1840 christened O.G. (perhaps originally Osmond Gilles) before the cream of Adelaide society. The ceremony was held to coincide with the launch of the township of Glenelg, whose proprietors included William Finke, Osmond Gilles (for whom the boat was named), H. R. Wigley (father of W. R. Wigley) and Mathew Smith. see also Early Experiences of Colonial Life in South Australia :The ceremony became a fiasco after a downpour turned the ground to a particularly slippery species of mud, and the boat refused to be launched when the tide did not rise to the height expected, and had to be postponed. O.G. was the first boat of any size to be built in South Australia; her first master F. Finney. Ward purchased the cutter in 1850 and enlarged her to 27 tons burthen, and from January 1851 to May 1854 he was plying her between Adelaide, what is now the Fleurieu Peninsula, Kangaroo Island and Yorke Peninsula, delivering supplies and returning with wheat and wool. On 19 May 1854 O.G. left Port Adelaide for Yankalilla and Rapid Bay, Captain Reid in command. After weighing anchor at Yankalilla on the afternoon of 23 May, the wind began to blow hard and increased to a heavy gale. The cutter was very light, having discharged nearly all her cargo, and Captain Reid found it impossible to prevent her from driving ashore, so let go his anchor as a last resort, but the cutter dragged anchor and soon foundered on the rocks at Poole's Flat, about 2km north of Second Valley. Captain and crew took to the boat, and with some difficulty ran her up a creek and no lives were lost. The ship was a total wreck; her burthen was only 20 tons, and therefore uninsured and Captain Reid's loss was estimated at over ¬£300. The site of the wreck was later known as Cutter Flat in recognition of the event. Brig Punch Punch, 150 tons, was a fine little brig owned by Adelaide businessmen Thomas Allen, George Henry Fox, Barnett, and others. Allen was in April 1853 deposed as captain by the majority of owners, and replaced with Sayers, to Allen's disgust, as he had no faith in Sayers' seamanship. On the morning of 10 September 1853 a gale blew up and she was pushed on-shore and stranded on the beach near Glenelg, though she suffered little damage. She was unloaded by bullock dray but remained stuck fast and could not be freed from the sand. On 20 September Ward purchased the brig \\"as is where is\\" for ¬£250. He rigged a series of empty water barrels under her hull and waited for the next \\"king tide\\", which occurred on 20 December 1853, when she was without incident towed out to sea and around to Port Adelaide. Ward traded with her to India, Java, and Eastern settlements. until 1856, when he sold her in Singapore. Schooners In May 1852 Captain Dowsett in the Government schooner Yatala discovered Port Augusta. In 1856 Ward bought the schooners Alice Martin (previously Flying Eagle) and Waitemata for the trade between Port Adelaide and Port Augusta and other ports. Waitemata, facetiously dubbed \\"Weighty Matter\\", gained some notoriety as the vessel in which \\"Bully\\" Hayes escaped from Adelaide early in 1858. Steamships Around 1852 Ward became associated with Darwent, Stilling, & Co., founded by the American entrepreneur Joseph Darwent, and to further their projects purchased the iron-hulled screw steamer Marion (124 tons), which he brought back from Melbourne and commanded until 1860, running regular services to Port Augusta. Elder, Stirling, & Co. then joined with Darwent, Stilling, & Co., and commissioned Ward to travel to Glasgow to either purchase or have built a coasting steamer. In the event he had built the iron screw steamer Lubra (167 tons), which he brought back under sail as a three-masted schooner, arriving in Adelaide in June 1861. :Ward did not have the appropriate certification for an overseas voyage, so had a relative, Captain William Orchard, command the ship. Orchard then had a considerable career as skipper of Ashburton in 1862, Kangaroo in 1865, and the wool ship Pekina 1866‚Äì1873, 1877. :Alexander McCoy became master of the Marion when Ward became involved with Lubra, and continued until she was wrecked on southern Yorke Peninsula in July 1862. In 1862 the screw steamer Coorong was built; the company in 1864 purchased Royal Shepherd (244 tons), of which Ward was skipper from 1865 to 1872, and Kangaroo in July 1867. The Lubra, Kangaroo, and Royal Shepherd had little or no opposition for many years in the South Australian coastal trade. Joseph Stilling died in 1863, and when Stirling retired the company became Elder, Smith & Co. Darwent & Dalwood lost a fortune over their involvement with the Overland Telegraph Line and in 1871 sold their shares in the steamships, and Ward also sold out to return to sailing ships. :In 1874 the company sent Capt. Joseph Hay (c. 1832‚Äì1894), son-in-law of Henry Fletcher (shipwright) (1820‚Äì1912), of Fletcher's \\"Dunnikier\\" Slip, to England to commission a new steamer, and in March 1875 brought back the Flinders, that went into the coasting trade, in charge of Capt. T. W. Lockyer (c. 1836‚Äì1898). The Adelaide Steamship Company was arguably formed about June 1876, and among its assets were the Flinders, Lubra, Kangaroo, and Royal Shepherd.  Barque Day Dawn  After Ward quit steamers he purchased the barques Wodonga in 1872, Phoenix in 1875 and Day Dawn (frequently Daydawn) in 1878. Day Dawn is remembered as one on which Frank T. Bullen (author of The Cruise of the Cachalot) served as ship's mate. Hansford Ward's son John was the ship's captain from the start, except on voyages outside Australian waters, when Hansford Ward was (at least nominally) in charge. On one such voyage in 1879, on returning from Noum√©a by way of Newcastle with a load of copper ore, she was dismasted and lay in a disabled and distressed condition until rescued by the Ellamang off Cape Moreton. John Ward skippered her for nine years, then in July 1886 after loading a cargo of railway sleepers at Quindalup, Western Australia a storm came up and blew her onto the shore, where she was wrecked. John Ward returned to Adelaide as chief officer of Collingrove, and shortly after was appointed captain of the Persian Empire plying between Melbourne and San Francisco. Other activities For 21 years he was a licensed marine surveyor at Port Adelaide, but relinquished that occupation because of failing health around 1900. Family (John Ralph) Hansford Ward (1817‚Äì1903) married Jane Best (c. 1819 ‚Äì 29 March 1887) in August 1840. She was eldest daughter of (James) Richard Best ( ‚Äì 1 January 1850); arrived in South Australia aboard Rajasthan in February 1840. Their children included: *(Harry) Hansford Ward (22 April 1850 ‚Äì 10 June 1916) married Julia Sholl in 1877; he was also a ship's captain. :*Harry Lancelot Ward (1881‚Äì1955) married Florence Hindmarsh Plumley in 1912 *John R(alph) H(ansford) Ward (8 April 1852‚Äì ) He was also a seaman, trained with his uncleThat would have to be William Orchard. There is no mention of uncle Richard having an association with Pekina on Pekina, acting captain of Day Dawn when she was incapacitated 1879, and her captain when she was stranded at Quindalup, Western Australia in 1887. By 1916 he was living in London. They had a home in Newcastle street, Rosatala ward, Port Adelaide. His brother Richard Porter Ward (c. 1823 ‚Äì 25 March 1898) was captain of barques Bosphorus 1867‚Äì1870, Wodonga 1873‚Äì1875, and Phoenix 1876‚Äì1884. He had several daughters including: *Mary Louisa Ward ( ‚Äì 1949) married William Henry Saunders (1852 ‚Äì 26 June 1928) in 1876. He was town clerk of Port Adelaide and brother of amateur historian A. T. Saunders.

Espert's proposals consist of lowering public spending, forming an agency similar to the US Drug Control Administration to combat drug trafficking, lowering taxes, decriminalizing personal marijuana use, decriminalizing abortion and reforming the education system through vouchers. He opposes industrial promotion regimes and believes that the right to strike has gone too far, harmed even the worker himself. Therefore, he seeks a labor, tax and state reform in general.

History The parents of the Indian mystic Anandamayi Ma used to live in Tikatuli. Rapid Action Battalion-3 has built their office was what used to be Tikatuli park. A community center was built on the park in the 1990s, near Mayor Hanif flyover, and it was rented out to RAB. Culture Pulin Behari Das, the Indian revolutionary, founded a gym in Tikatuli in 1903. The Bengal Motion Pictures Studio Ltd, one of the first and one of two private movie production studios in Dhaka is located in Taktuli. It was established in 1969 in Rose Garden Palace in Tikatuli The Rose Garden Palace was built by a Hindu lower caste zamindar (Landlord) Hrishikesh Das in the late 19th century.[1] Around that time jalsas (parties) held at Baldha Garden were an important part of the social life of the city's wealthier Hindu residents. The story goes that Hrishikesh Das, a Zamidar (Landlord) of Hindu lower caste background, being insulted on this account by someone at one of the jalsas (parties) at Baldha Garden, and decided to create his own garden to outshine that of Baldha Garden. Here he staged jalsas (parties) of his own. The centerpiece of the garden is an elegant pavillion. However, this was not created as a residence, but rather a setting for entertainment such as musical performances (although subsequent owners did use it as a house). This extravagant lifestyle caused Zamidar (Landlord) Hrishikesh Das to go bankrupt and consequently he was forced to sell the property. In 1937 the Rose Garden Palace was bought by a prominent businessman Khan Bahadur Kazi Abdur Rashid of Dhaka from the family members of Late Bashiruddin Sarker, the Zamidar (Landlord) of Nabinagar under Brahmanbaria district. He renamed the building as Rashid Manzil. His eldest son Kazi Mohammed Bashir (Humayun) who carried his name and fame until this generation. The building had been renovated by its previous owners while keeping the original character fully maintained. The Government of Bangladesh bought the building for Tk 331.70 crore in a purchase announced on 9 August 2018.[2] The government has since announced plans to turn the location into a MuseumRose_Garden_Palace.

Sexual assault and severe or pervasive sexual harassment are types of sex discrimination prohibited under Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, a civil rights law that prohibits sex discrimination in any education program that receives federal funding. SSAIS accomplishes its mission by creating and distributing free education programs, filing pro bono civil rights complaints with the Office for Civil Rights (OCR), collaborating with national gender equity organizations, supporting legislative and legal initiatives, working with communities and families to bring schools into Title IX compliance, and educating the media about how sexual harassment and sexual violence in K‚Äì12 schools can violate students‚Äô rights.  Founding  SSAIS is the first national nonprofit organization created solely to address sexual harassment and assault in K‚Äì12 schools. It was founded in 2015 by two parent educators, Drs. Esther Warkov and Joel Levin, whose daughter was reportedly raped on a Seattle public school fieldtrip in 2012. The parents led a high- profile effort to hold the district accountable for its failure to recognize the victim‚Äôs federally mandated Title IX rights. Their Title IX complaint, and the media attention it attracted, resulted in community protests that compelled the Seattle school district to commission a community task force, reform its sexual harassment policy, comply with Title IX directives, and improve its safety procedures on school field trips. After learning how pervasive sexual harassment is in K‚Äì12 schools nationwide, Warkov and Levin launched the SSAIS.org website in September 2015 as a comprehensive resource for K‚Äì12 families. President and CEO of the National Women‚Äôs Law Center, Fatima Goss Graves, wrote an inaugural blog post for the website launch.  History  Media reports about SSAIS in the Washington Post, Huffington Post, Women‚Äôs eNews, Slate, Broadly, NEAToday, and NPR affiliates have increased awareness of the pervasiveness of peer and educator sexual harassment and assault in K‚Äì12 schools. In 2016, SSAIS joined the National Coalition for Women and Girls in Education and contributed to their comprehensive report Title IX at 45. In March 2016, the Office of the Vice President invited SSAIS to advise on strategies to address K‚Äì12 sexual violence. In the same year, SSAIS received an American Association of University Women Community Action Grant to create a free comprehensive video and Action Guide, Sexual Harassment: Not in Our School! The video and companion materials were released in November, 2016.  Initiatives  The SSAIS website maintains comprehensive resources for parents and students about sexual harassment and sexual violence occurring in K‚Äì12 schools, with free educational materials informing communities about Title IX and how to hold schools accountable for providing safe learning environments for all students. SSAIS provides families with pro bono support for filing complaints with the U.S. Department of Education Office for Civil Rights. These efforts have resulted in federal investigations of K‚Äì12 schools in Washington, Oregon, Michigan, Georgia, and Texas. SSAIS also offers resources to families whose students have experienced sexual harassment and sexual assault in schools. SSAIS creates advocacy opportunities for youth, sexual assault survivors, and families. It also unites advocates through its Coalition Against Sexual Harassment K12 (CASHK12). SSAIS has supported legislative initiatives and amicus briefs that uphold students‚Äô civil rights. In January, 2018, SSAIS launched the MeTooK12 campaign to promote awareness and inspire action to counteract pervasive sexual harassment and sexual violence in K‚Äì12 schools.

The church dates back to the 13th century, and was designated a Grade II* listed building in 1963. Unusually for churches in the United Kingdom, Elmstone Church does not feature a dedication to any saint. History and architecture The nave and lower chancel are from Norman times and are built out of flint. The chancel contains a north window and the nave contains two south windows; all three have Caen stone heads and sills, as well as jambs made of flint. Early 14th-century remodelling is visible in the Y-tracery of the west window, and in the three-light east window which contains intersecting tracery. There is also evidence of an early 14th-century enlargement, specifically the north aisle and the north-west tower, both being built out of squared knapped flint. The church also boasts square-headed windows with ogee lights. The porch is situated to the south. There is an arcade of three bays typical of the 13th century, with the west bay being shared by the tower. The piers are octagonal, and the arches are double- chamfered. The priest's stall is dated to the 14th century, and the pulpit is of a late 19th-century design by Edward Schroeder Prior, with linenfold panels reminiscent of Charles Voysey. The church is not known to feature a dedication to any known saint, a rare occurrence for Anglican churches in the United Kingdom; the church is thereby titled as \\"Elmstone Church\\" for any official purposes. The east chancel window, depicting the Passion of Jesus Glass and windows In the east of the chancel is a stained glass window consisting of the Passion of Jesus in 12th-century styled roundels. In the east of the north aisle is stained glass depicting the Resurrection of Jesus. Both windows were produced by William Wailes around 1863. In the west of the nave is stained glass depicting the church's armorial; the date is unknown, however architectural historian John Newman gives a probable date of production around 1840. The north aisle also contains a window by Burlison and Grylls, as well as a window depicting the Nativity by James Powell and Sons. A distorted depiction of 7th-century saints is present on a window in the south wall. The west window contains medieval glass, and the north chancel window contains a medieval roundel depiction of the Lamb of God. Furniture and monuments The church possesses a font that is either 12th or 13th century, set on five shafts. There is a Bethersden marble bowl, being square below with a rounded top; the transition is made through anvil-shaped corner pieces. There are four poppyheads incorporated into the rector's stall. A monument of Robert Jaques (died 1671) is attributable to Joshua Marshall, built in black and white marble into the south side of the chancel. At the top is a frontal bust, with draperies in an antique style.

The painting is considered one of her most famous works as it sold for almost $1.5 million in 2009. Carrington created The Giantess circa 1947 in Mexico City after becoming a resident of Mexico in 1942. The tempera on wood panel painting is 117 x 68 cm. The Giantess now resides in the private collection of Miguel S. Escobedo in Mexico. Description Carrington wrote, ‚Äú... it‚Äôs a sort of a giantess with a moonlike face in a field of wheat which is also golden hair. Her cape is white and she has a russet red dress with panels in which birdlike people are conversing. Out of the cape come wild geese which encircle her. She is standing against a sort of turquoise sea in which are small islands‚Ä¶‚ÄùRaaij As described by Carrington, the giantess, a huge female figure, stands in the center of the landscape scene with the sea behind her. She has an oval shaped body. Surrounding her head is a field of golden wheat glowing like a halo. A small face floats in the middle of the wheat. She wears a red dress beneath a white cape. Through the opening of her cape are depictions of strange bird headed people and a three headed bird in a register of scenes on the front of her dress. Two tiny hands holding a spotted egg emerge from inside of the cape. At her waist, two geese fly out from beneath the cape, while others fly around her. The Giantess appears peaceful with her eyes directed towards some of the geese flying beside her. Between the Giantess‚Äôs feet are three barely noticeable women. Groups of three women are a recurring motif in much of Carrington's art, such as Three Women Around the Table (1951), and The Magdalens (1986). Some have concluded that this is a representation of her with her circle of surrealist artist friends in Mexico, Remedios Varo and Kati Horna.Blumberg In Celtic mythology, there are triple deity goddesses and for Carrington, Giantess was synonymous with Goddess.Carrington. IMOMA These three women and the symbolic geese could be another clue that this is indeed a work portraying a specific goddess. The egg held by the Giantess was another recurring motif in Carrington‚Äôs works. In Down Below, a short book by Carrington recalling her memoirs from time spent in a mental institution, she describes the conception of her egg motif. ‚ÄúThis morning, the idea of the egg came again to my mind and I thought that I could use it as a crystal to look at Madrid in those days of July and August 1940‚Äîfor why should it not enclose my own experiences as well as the past and future history of the Universe? The egg is the macrocosm and the microcosm, the dividing line between the Big and the Small which makes it impossible to see the whole.‚ÄùCarrington. Down Below However, the egg already had a history of alchemic symbolism. Several have found similarities in Carrington‚Äôs egg and Hieronymus Bosch‚Äôs in works such as The Garden of Earthly Delights. There are considerable likenesses between The Giantess and early colonial representations of Irish people. Much of the painting has a simple folk aesthetic. The attire, of the figures and Giantess‚Äôs cape with gold surrounded head are similar to that of figures in works such as Albrecht D√ºrer‚Äôs Irish Warrior and Peasants (1521), John Derricke‚Äôs Rorie Oge, The Image of Ireland (1581) and John Speed‚Äôs Map of Ireland (1610).

Despite being based in Vienna, the focus of NOYB is pan-European. Co- founded by Austrian lawyer and privacy activist Max Schrems, NOYB aims to launch strategic court cases and media initiatives in support of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the proposed ePrivacy Regulation, and information privacy in general. It was funded after a funding period during which it has raised ‚Ç¨250,000 in annual donations by supporting members. Currently NOYB is financed by more than 3,200 supporting members. While many privacy organisations focus attention on governments, NOYB puts its focus on privacy issues and privacy violations in the private sector. Under Article 80, the GDPR foresees that non-profit organizations can take action or represent users.  Notable actions  NOYB works on different legal actions against tech companies that allegedly violated the GDPR, they include:  EU-US data transfers (Schrems II)  The Irish Data Protection Commission (DPC) has filed a lawsuit against him and Facebook in 2016 that is based on a complaint from 2013, which has already led to the so-called \\"Safe Harbor Decision\\". This this decision the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) has invalidated the Safe Harbor data transfer system. When the case was referred back to the DPC the Irish regulator found that Facebook has in fact relied on Standard Contact Clauses, not on the invalidated Safe Harbor. The DPC then found that there were \\"well-founded\\" concerns by Mr Schrems under these instruments too, but instead of taking action against Facebook, initiated proceedings against Facebook and Mr Schrems before the Irish High Court. The case was ultimately referred to the CJEU in C-311/18 (called 'Schrems II'). NOYB supported this private case of Mr Schrems.  \\"Forced Consent\\" Complaints (2018)  Within hours after General Data Protection Regulation rules went into effect on 25 May 2018, NOYB filed complaints against Facebook and subsidiaries WhatsApp and Instagram, as well as Google LLC (targeting Android), for allegedly violating Article 7(4) by attempting to completely block use of their services if users decline to accept all data processing consents, in a bundled grant which also includes consents deemed unnecessary to use the service. Based on the complaint, the French data protection authority CNIL has issued a ‚Ç¨50 Mio fine against Google LLC.  Open Letter on GDPR cooperation mechanism (2020)  NOYB also focuses on putting pressure on regulators to enforce privacy laws on the books. In an open letter, NOYB has accused the Irish Data Protection Commission of acting too slow and having 10 meetings with Facebook before the coming into application of the GDPR.  Other  NOYB also started a collaborative Wiki on the General Data Protection Regulation, called GDPRhub.eu. On the webpage they collect English summaries of local GDPR decisions by Data Protection Authorities or Courts.

Rise discusses the impact accelerating change and artificial intelligence will have on the labor market. His thesis is that there will be great social and economic disruption, as educated workers will no longer be able to find employment; unlike in previous technological revolutions, very few new jobs will be created in the course of the ongoing disruption.  Thesis  While technological advances in the previous century mainly displaced uneducated laborers, the 21st century is seeing technology increasingly threatening skilled workers' jobs as well. Lawyers, radiologists and software designers have seen their work outsourced to the developing world. Ford believes that unlike previous centuries, the current emerging technologies will fail to generate new forms of employment; he predicts that new industries will \\"rarely, if ever, be highly labor- intensive\\". Companies like YouTube and Instagram are based on \\"tiny workforces and huge valuations and revenues\\". Ford downplays the benefits of expanding education (\\"The problem is that the skills ladder is not really a ladder at all: it is a pyramid, and there is only so much room at the top\\"), and argues for a \\"dramatic policy response\\" such as a guaranteed basic income. Many economists disagree with Ford's thesis that the IT revolution is fundamentally different from previous technological revolutions. Libertarian economist Robin Hanson argues that the recent ominous labor trends may have causes other than automation, such as \\"demographics, regulation, worker values, organization practices, and other technologies\\".  Reception  The book was praised for lucidly arguing its bleak viewpoint. Reviewing Rise in the New York Times, Barbara Ehrenreich stated \\"The human consequences of robotization are already upon us, and skillfully chronicled here\\". A review in the Los Angeles Times stated that Rise was \\"Lucid, comprehensive and unafraid to grapple fairly with those who dispute Ford's basic thesis\\", and \\"better than 'Lights in the Tunnel'\\", Ford's previous book on the same topic. The Guardian's review points out the book gets more speculative as it goes on, and states: \\"Although it may be difficult to overstate the dangers posed by the new technology\\", Rise may have managed to do so, but is regardless well worth reading. The \\"Dot Physics\\" column in Wired stated \\"It's sort of depressing to think about the future in cases where robots dominate. Overall, the book was well written with interesting stories about both business and technology.\\" Financial Times chief US commentator Edward Luce called Rise \\"well researched and disturbingly persuasive\\". Rise was awarded the ¬£30,000 Financial Times and McKinsey Business Book of the Year Award of 2015.

The term was discontinued when the FBI merged several classifications under the umbrella term of ‚Äúracially motivated violent extremism‚Äù. Reactions The term first received media attention in October 2017 when Foreign Policy published a leaked copy of the report in October 2017.

However, former government officials and legal experts claimed the term described a movement that did not exist. Civil liberties organizations and political commentators expressed concern that the internal use of this designation by the FBI's counter-terrorism unit signals a politically-motivated effort to falsely equivocate black activism, such as the Black Lives Matter movement, with white supremacists.

The section from Amaliegade to Bredgade was called Blancogade. The origins of the name are unclear. The section from Bredgade to Store Kongensgade was variously referred to as Akademigade (Academy Street) and Kadetgade (Cadet Street). Both names referred to the Cadet Academy which was located in the street. The sections from Store Kongensgade to Borgergade was called Kaninl√¶ngen (The Rabbit Row) and the section from Borgergade to Adelgade was called Bj√∏rnegade (Bear Street). The section from Adelgade to Kronprinsessegade was called Nellikegade. The section from Kronprinsessegade to Rigensgade was called Kokkegade (Cook Street). The name Fredericiagade was introduced in 1869 at the initiative of city engineer Thorvald Krak to reduce the vast and confusing number of street names in the city. The new name was chosen to honour the town of Fredericia for its role in the Three Years' War.

The series comprising the trilogy follow the inhabitants of the small suburban town of Arcadia Oaks, which is secretly home to various supernatural creatures and the young heroes who fight against the forces of evil that lurk in the shadows. The three installments of the trilogy, Trollhunters, 3Below and Wizards, have been released worldwide. It was announced the trilogy would be concluded with a full-length feature film, titled Trollhunters: Rise of the Titans, to be released in 2021. Production history Guillermo del Toro initially envisioned the idea of Trollhunters as a live-action television series; however, this was deemed impractical due to budgetary concerns, and as a result he instead turned the idea into a book he co-wrote alongside Daniel Kraus. DreamWorks then planned to turn the book into an animated feature film, but eventually decided to instead turn it into a series. In November 2017, del Toro announced that Trollhunters will be followed up by two sequel series titled 3Below and Wizards. In December 2017, it was revealed that two characters from Trollhunters‚ÄïSteve Palchuk and Eli Pepperjack (voiced by Steven Yeun and Cole Sand, respectively)‚Äïwill have their roles extended into 3Below. In April 2018, it was announced that the role of Jim Lake Jr. would incorporate both the voices of Anton Yelchin and Emile Hirsch for the entirety of Part 3, and that two characters introduced in Part 3 of Trollhunters ‚ÄïAja and Krel (voiced by Tatiana Maslany and Diego Luna, respectively)‚Äïwill also reprise their roles and serve as the leads in 3Below. In May 2018, it was revealed that Steve Palchuk and Eli Pepperjack would also have their roles extended into Wizards as well, making them the first characters to have roles encompassing the entire trilogy. In August 2020, it was announced the trilogy would be concluded with a full-length feature film, titled Trollhunters: Rise of the Titans, set to be released in 2021. Setting Tales of Arcadia follows the inhabitants of the small suburban town of Arcadia Oaks, which is secretly home to various supernatural creatures and the young heroes who fight against the forces of evil that lurk in the shadows.  Premise  Firstly in Trollhunters, a boy named Jim Lake becomes the first human to be a Trollhunter, carrying the duty of protecting both the trolls living in Trollmarket and humans living in the surface world from the Gumm-Gumms led by Gunmar. Then in 3Below, two royal siblings named Aja and Krel Tarron, who live on the alien planet Akiridion-5, must escape to Earth when their home is taken over by an evil general named Val Morando. Then in Wizards, a wizard-in- training named Douxie Casperan must embark on a time-bending adventure to medieval Camelot in a battle with the Arcane Order. And finally in Trollhunters: Rise of the Titans, the heroes of Arcadia must join forces for the last time when the city is on the brink of an apocalyptic battle for the control of magic that will determine the fate of these supernatural worlds that have now converged.

The following season, he was hired as the Warriors' special teams coach. During this season, Hawaii led the nation in kickoff return yardage, averaging an NCAA record 30.3 yards per return. Chad Owens, who was among the players Helton coached on special teams, set school records for all-purpose yardage. From 2004 to 2006, Helton coached tight ends and special teams on the staff of Coach Tommy West at Memphis. Players he coached during this period included future New England Patriots kicker Stephen Gostkowski, who became the school's all-time career scoring leader, and was named Conference USA Special Teams Player of the Year in 2005. In 2007, Helton joined the UAB Blazers staff as quarterbacks coach under head coach Neil Callaway. His father, Kim, had been hired as the Blazers' offensive coordinator. Under Helton's tutelage, UAB quarterback Joe Webb became the first player in NCAA history to pass for over 2,000 yards and rush for over 1,000 yards in consecutive seasons. After Callaway was fired in 2011, Helton switched to running backs coach on the staff of newly-hired head coach Garrick McGee. During Helton's only season on McGee's staff, Blazers running back Darrin Reaves rushed for over a thousand yards and was awarded all-conference honors. After spending the 2013 season on the Cincinnati Bearcats staff, Helton was hired as the offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach under head coach Jeff Brohm at Western Kentucky.

Estimating the time at which a certain allele appeared allows researchers to infer patterns of human migration, disease, and natural selection. Allele age can be estimated based on (1) the frequency of the allele in a population and (2) the genetic variation that occurs within different copies of the allele, also known as intra-allelic variation. While either of these methods can be used to estimate allele age, the use of both increases the accuracy of the estimation and can sometimes offer additional information regarding the presence of selection. Estimating allele age based on the allele‚Äôs frequency is based on the fact that alleles in high frequency are older than alleles in low frequency (assuming the absence of selection). Of course, many alleles of interest are under some type of selection. Because alleles that are under positive selection can rise to high frequency very quickly, it is important to understand the mechanisms that underlie allele frequency change, such as natural selection, gene flow, genetic drift, and mutation. Estimating allele age based on intra-allelic variation is based on the fact that with every generation, linkage with other alleles (linkage disequilibrium) is disrupted by recombination and new variation in linkage is created via new mutations. The analysis of intra-allelic variation to assess allele age depends on coalescent theory. There are two different approaches that can be used to analyze allele age based on intra-allelic variation. First, a phylogenetics approach extrapolates an allele‚Äôs age by reconstructing a gene tree and dating the root of the tree. This approach is best when analyzing ancient, as opposed to recent, mutations. Second, a population genetics approach estimates allele age by using mutation, recombination, and demography models instead of a gene tree. This type of approach is best for analyzing recent mutations. Recently, Albers and McVean (2018) proposed a non- parametric method to estimate the age of an allele, using probabilistic, coalescent-based models of mutation and recombination. Specifically, their method infers the time to the most recent common ancestor (TMRCA) between hundreds or thousands of chromosomal sequence (haplotype) pairs. This information is then combined using a composite likelihood approach to obtain an estimate of the time of mutation at a single locus. This methodology was applied to more than 16 million variants in the human genome, using data from the 1000 Genomes Project and the Simons Genome Diversity Project, to generate the atlas of variant age.  History  Population geneticists, Motoo Kimura and Tomoko Ohta, were the first to analyze the association between an allele‚Äôs frequency and its age in the 1970s. They showed that the age of a neutral allele can be estimated (assuming a large, randomly mating population) by E(t_1)=(-2p)/(1-p) \\\\ln(p) Where p represents the allele frequency and t_1 is the expected age, measured in units of 2N generations. More recent studies, however, have focused on the analysis of intra-allelic variation. In 1990, Jean-Louis Serre and his team were the first to assess allele age by analyzing intra-allelic variation. Using a sample of 240 French families, they surveyed two restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLP) sites (E1 and E2) that are closely linked to an allele (ŒîF508) at the cystic fibrosis locus (CFTR). Recombination theory allows for the calculation of x(t), the expected frequency of E2 in association with the allele ŒîF508 in generation t, and y, the frequency of E2 on chromosomes without the ŒîF508 allele. The recombination rate, c, is assumed to be known, and so the allele age can be calculated as an estimate of t. t={1\\\\over\\\\ln(1-c)}\\\\ln{x(t)-y \\\\over 1-y} Although Serre et al. (1990) were the first to employ this method, it became increasingly popular after the Risch et al. study in 1995, which analyzed alleles in an Ashkenazi Jewish population.  Examples of allele age estimations  Many intra-allelic variation studies suggest that disease-causing alleles arose rather recently in human history.  Cystic fibrosis  The Serre et al. (1990) study estimated that an allele causing cystic fibrosis arose approximately 181.4 generations ago. Therefore, they estimated that the allele age to be between 3,000 and 6,000 years ago. However, other studies have obtained drastically different estimates. Morral et al. (1994) suggested a minimum age of 52,000 years ago. A reanalysis of the Morral et al. (1994) data by Slatkin and Rannala (2000) estimated an allele age of approximately 3,000 years, which is consistent with the Serre et al. (1990) results.  AIDS-resistance allele (CCR5)  A 32 base pair deletion at the CCR5 locus results in resistance to the HIV infection, which causes AIDS. Individuals who are homozygous for the mutation experience complete resistance to the infection, while heterozygotes only experience partial resistance to the infection, resulting in a delayed onset of AIDS. A study by Stephens et al. in 1998 suggested that this allele originated approximately 27.5 generations, or 688 years ago. These results were obtained using intra-allelic variation analysis. This same study also used the allele frequency and the Kimura-Ohta model to estimate allele age. This method provided very different results, suggesting that the allele appeared more than 100,000 years ago. Stephens et al. (1996) argue that the discrepancy between these age estimates strongly suggest recent positive selection for the CCR5 mutation. Because the CCR5 mutation also offers resistance to smallpox, these results are consistent with the idea that the CCR5 mutation first rose to higher frequency due to positive selection during smallpox outbreaks in European history before being positively selected for due to its role in HIV resistance.  Lactase persistence  Many adults are lactose intolerant because their bodies cease production of the enzyme lactase post childhood. However, mutations in the promoter region of the lactase gene (LCT) result in the continued production of lactase throughout adulthood in certain African populations, a condition known as lactase persistence. A study conducted by Sarah Tishkoff and her team shows that the mutation for lactase persistence has been under positive selection since its recent appearance approximately 3,000 to 7,000 years ago. These dates are consistent with the rise of cattle domestication and pastoralist lifestyles in these regions, making the lactase persistence mutation a strong example of gene-culture co- evolution.

All 31 seats in the City Council were up for election. The election was held simultaneously with regional elections in thirteen autonomous communities and local elections all throughout Spain. Electoral system The City Council of Seville () was the top-tier administrative and governing body of the municipality of Seville, composed of the mayor, the government council and the elected plenary assembly. Elections to the local councils in Spain were fixed for the fourth Sunday of May every four years. Voting for the local assembly was on the basis of universal suffrage, which comprised all nationals over eighteen, registered and residing in the municipality of Seville and in full enjoyment of their political rights, as well as resident non-national European citizens and those whose country of origin allowed Spanish nationals to vote in their own elections by virtue of a treaty. Local councillors were elected using the D'Hondt method and a closed list proportional representation, with a threshold of five percent of valid votes‚Äîwhich included blank ballots‚Äîbeing applied in each local council. Parties not reaching the threshold were not taken into consideration for seat distribution. Councillors were allocated to municipal councils based on the following scale: {  style=\\"text- align:left; font-size:95%;\\" - bgcolor=\\"#E9E9E9\\" align=\\"center\\" ! width=\\"120\\" Population ! width=\\"265\\" Councillors -  <100  3 -  101‚Äì250  5 -  251‚Äì1,000  7 -  1,001‚Äì2,000  9 -  2,001‚Äì5,000  11 -  5,001‚Äì10,000  13 -  10,001‚Äì20,000  17 -  20,001‚Äì50,000  21 -  50,001‚Äì100,000  25 -  >100,001  +1 per each 100,000 inhabitants or fraction +1 if total is an even number } The mayor was indirectly elected by the plenary assembly. A legal clause required that mayoral candidates earned the vote of an absolute majority of councillors, or else the candidate of the most-voted party in the assembly was to be automatically appointed to the post. In the event of a tie, a toss-up would determine the appointee. The electoral law allowed for parties and federations registered in the interior ministry, coalitions and groupings of electors to present lists of candidates. Parties and federations intending to form a coalition ahead of an election were required to inform the relevant Electoral Commission within ten days of the election call, whereas groupings of electors needed to secure the signature of a determined amount of the electors registered in the municipality for which they were seeking election, disallowing electors from signing for more than one list of candidates. For the case of Seville, as its population was between 300,001 and 1,000,000, at least 5,000 signatures were required.

The headquarters of the National Guard is based in Tashkent, where most of the 30,000 soldiers that make up the force are located. As of 2020, the individual in charge of the UNG is currently Rustam Jo'raev.https://www.gazeta.uz/ru/2020/03/16/appointments/ He succeeded Colonel General Bahodir Tashmatov (former Chief of the Joint Staff) and Botir Tursunov (former deputy director of the Institute for Strategic and Regional Studies). History It was founded on 30 January 1992 in Tashkent on the basis of the Military Unit No. 3408 and as the direct successor to the Internal Troops of the Uzbek SSR. The ceremonial company of the Uzbek National Guard guarded the body of the late Uzbek president Islam Karimov after his death in September 2016. In August 2017, President Shavkat Mirziyoyev issued a presidential decree which effectively removed the National Guard as one of the military's branches of service and made it an independent institution. It was transferred to the Defense Ministry's control the following January. In July 2019, the government amended its criminal code, giving the UNG the expanded authority to conduct pretrial investigations and detain people and hold suspects at the local headquarters. Some analysts have theorized that this expansion of authority may be an attempt to sideline the National Security Service (SNB), which was largely seen as being loyal to former president Islam Karimov. Mandate The main purpose of the National Guard is to protect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Uzbekistan and the constitutional rights and freedoms of citizens. In fulfilling its purpose, it guards important strategic bases and facilities, as well as important Uzbek officials. It mainly specializes in operations involving small alleys and street fighting. In its early years, it was effectively serving as the personal secret service to President Islam Karimov, often being seen along the road when he was driven from his residence to the Ok Saroy Presidential Palace. Since President Shavkat Mirziyoyev came to the presidency in 2016, the national guard has re-emerged as a law and order body, with Mirziyoyev delegating the role of combating domestic terrorism to the agency. It is given assistance by similar institutions of its neighbors, including the Russian Rosgvardia and the Chinese People's Armed Police. Leadership It has the following management structure:http://milliygvardiya.uz/site/leadership *Commandant of the National Guard - Major General Rustam Jo'raev *First Deputy Commandant of the National Guard - Bekmurod Abdullayev *Deputy Commandant of the National Guard - Sarvar Mamayusupov *Deputy Commandant of the National Guard - Mamirjon Ganiyeb Components  Directorates  In July 2019, the National Guard HQ Directorate and its territorial units, which were previously part of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, were transferred to the National Guard: * National Guard HQ Directorate (Tashkent) * Andijon Directorate * Bukhara Directorate * Fergana Directorate * Jizzakh Directorate * Namangan Directorate * Navoiy Directorate * Qashqadaryo Directorate * Samarqand Directorate * Sirdaryo Directorate * Surxondaryo Directorate * Tashkent Directorate * Xorazm Directorate * Karakalpakstan Directorate An advisory council is formed under the head of the Main Directorate of Security, consisting of 7‚Äì9 experienced employees of the directorate and other divisions of the security service, as well as scientists with scientific potential in the relevant field.

History The monastery was founded by several monks in the 11th century. A reconstruction of the monastery, was carried out in the 16th and 17th centuries. St Panteleimon is celebrated on 27 July. Before the Turkish invasion of Cyprus in 1974, many people from all over Cyprus were visiting the monastery to pay their respects to St Panteleimon as well as people from abroad. Since the invasion, the monastery of Saint Panteleimon remains empty. Monastic building The west side of the central church building and outbuildings on the north side of the compound The monastery complex is made up of buildings of various dates and includes a section used as a guest house.A description of the historic monuments of Cyprus, by George Jeffery, publ.Nicosia, 1918; Page 278 In the 19th and 20th centuries the resident monastic population was around 10-20.Census of Cyprus 1881, pr. Eyre and Spottiswoode, London, 1884 Census of Cyprus 1931, pr. Government Printer, Nicosia, 1932 A main entrance was constructed in the late 19th century. The church has Renaissance features but has been much altered. Around 17th-18th centuries the original nave was demolished and rebuilt with a remarkable covered exterior corridor (loggia) of pointed arches and vaulting (south side). Between the nave and the loggia is the chapel of St Panteleimon, which is of ancient date. It has a Barrel Vault style. It is separated from the nave by semi-circular arches sitting on short columns. This old part of the church has a number of doors and windows which open on to the exterior corridor. The inside of the church had an Iconostasis (wall of icons and religious paintings separating the nave from the sanctuary) which included portions of an older mediaeval screen. The part of the iconostasis across the chapel of St Panteleimon had elaborate wood carving, much added recently. Many icons were of superior quality, possibly medieval. The chapel of St Panteleimon is separated from the rest by an unusual elegant iron screen. This unusual feature gives much interest to the interior. The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the (bi-communal) Technical Committee on Cultural Heritage in Cyprus, and European Union started conservation works to St Panteleimon monastery on 9 October 2015.Cyprus Mail article https://cyprus- mail.com/2015/10/09/restoration-work-to-start-on-ayios-panteleimon-monastery/ retrieved July 2018 References External links * ŒûŒµŒ∫ŒØŒΩŒ∑œÉŒµ Œ∑ Œ±ŒΩŒ±œÉœÑŒÆŒªœâœÉŒ∑ œÑŒøœÖ ŒºŒøŒΩŒ±œÉœÑŒ∑œÅŒπŒøœç œÑŒøœÖ ŒëŒ≥ŒØŒøœÖ Œ†Œ±ŒΩœÑŒµŒªŒµŒÆŒºŒøŒΩŒ± œÉœÑŒ∑ŒΩ Œ∫Œ±œÑŒµœáœåŒºŒµŒΩŒ∑ ŒúœçœÅœÑŒøœÖ (PHOTOS)  ŒîŒπŒ±Œ∫œåŒΩŒ∑ŒºŒ± * Œ†Œ±œÅŒ±Œ¥ŒØŒ¥ŒµœÑŒ±Œπ Œ±œÄœå œÑŒ∑ŒΩ Œ§ŒµœáŒΩŒπŒ∫ŒÆ ŒïœÄŒπœÑœÅŒøœÄŒÆ Œ∫Œ±Œπ Œ∑ ŒºŒøŒΩŒÆ œÑŒøœÖ ŒëŒ≥.

She is one of America's few Latina winemakers, known for Bordeaux-style wines at Chimney Rock, a part of Terlato Wine Group.  Career  Vianna came to the wine world by happenstance. She studied Biology in undergrad at Vassar College in New York and worked as a clinical toxicologist after completing her undergraduate education. While living in New York City an working in New York Hospital- Cornell Medical Center, she tasted a glass of 1985 Sociando Mallet while at an auction at Chrisie's Auction House. This newfound appreciation for wine led her to apply to the University of California, Davis for a masters program in winemaking. While in school, Vianna began an internship at Chimney Rock. When she graduated in 1999, Vianna became an enologist at that Napa company, and was named assistant winemaker there in 2002. She then advanced to the position of winemaker in 2005. In 2011, Vianna was promoted to General Manager of the winery, while continuing in her role as head winemaker of this Stags Leap District estate enterprise. Over time, Vianna worked with California's top winemakers, including Heidi Barrett, Erin Green, Pam Starr, and Celia Welch. In 2009, Vianna was honored by the UC, Davis School of Graduate Studies when she was invited to deliver the commencement speech to the class of 2009. She is frequently selected for tasting panels and judging wine competitions. In 2012, PBS filmed Vianna's work at Chimney Rock for a six-part TV series titled Vintage. The show took viewers behind-the-scenes at three Napa Valley wineries during the 2012 harvest season. In 2017, Vianna's vines were almost affected by the October northern California wildfires.

G√©rardin became a member of the Soci√©t√© Math√©matique de France in 1906. He wrote many articles for L‚ÄôEnseignement Math√©matique, Nouvelles Annales de Math√©matiques, and other French mathematical journals, as well as a few articles for foreign mathematical journals. He was one of nine mathematicians who read the initial page proofs and suggested improvements for the first volume of Leonard E. Dickson's History of the Theory of Numbers. In that volume, Dickson and G√©rardin announced for the first time that the Mersenne number M173 has the factor 730753. G√©rardin was an Invited Speaker of the ICM in 1912 at Cambridge UK, in 1920 at Strasbourg, in 1928 at Bologna, and in 1932 at Z√ºrich. He was the founder and editor for many years of the mathematical review Sphinx-Oedipe, started in 1906. In 1944 he, along with Paul Belgod√®re, started the journal Interm√©diarie des Recherches Math√©matiques. In 1948 G√©rardin started publishing the journal Diophante and continued with it until his death. In 1949, Paul Belgod√®re, the director (from 1949 to 1986) of the Institut Henri Poincar√©, purchased the important mathematical library that G√©rardin had accumulated at Nancy.

Its founding organisations were the National Heart Foundation of New Zealand, the Cancer Society of New Zealand, Action on Smoking and Health (Ash NZ), Te Hotu Manawa MƒÅori (a division of the National Heart Foundation) and the Asthma and Respiratory Foundation of New Zealand. It ceased operation on 30 June 2016.  Background  Motivations for establishing the Smokefree Coalition included perceived gaps in the Smoke-free Environments Act 1990. It was believed the Smokefree Coalition could do advocacy to help close these gaps and that, while each of the founding organisations had tobacco control as a focus, a new entity was needed that could speak nationally to represent the tobacco control interests of these and other organisations who would later join. The Smokefree Coalition became incorporated as a charitable trust in 1997 after which it entered into a contract with the Health Funding Authority, and later the Ministry of Health.  Vision, mission and objectives  The Smokefree Coalition adopted as its vision that New Zealand would become smokefree. Its mission statement was that it \\"will work to improve the health of all New Zealanders by reducing tobacco use and its health consequences. It will advocate for a smokefree Aotearoa New Zealand.\\" This was to be achieved through: * researching and compiling information on smoking issues in New Zealand and internationally * disseminating this information to members, Government and the general public * advocating for strong tobacco control measures, especially through legislation and regulation (including enforcement), taxation and health promotion * co- ordinating the advocacy efforts of agencies involved in tobacco control with the objective of providing a unified approach to Government on such matters. The Smokefree Coalition supported the principles of New Zealand's founding document, the Treaty of Waitangi and the principles and strategies endorsed by the Ottawa Charter.  Governance  The Smokefree Coalition was governed by a Board of Trustees who provided strategic direction, ensured the financial viability of the organisation and oversaw the activities of the Executive Director. Board members were appointed for a three-year term. However, in November 2007 the Deed of Trust was varied to remove the restriction on the term for which a Board member appointed by one of the five founding organisations may hold office. The Chair of the Smokefree Coalition, appointed by the Board, assumed the role of employer of the Executive Director and presided over all meetings of the Board. The Executive Director was responsible for the day-to-day finances of the Smokefree Coalition, acted as its spokesperson and worked to further its goals and objectives. Executive Directors of the Smokefree Coalition were as follows: * Barbara Langford 1995‚Äì1999 * Leigh Sturgiss 1999‚Äì2005 * Mark Peck 2005‚Äì2009 * Dr Prudence Stone 2009‚Äì2016.  Membership  Membership of the Smokefree Coalition was restricted to organisations with an interest in tobacco control. Individual memberships were not allowed. Member organisations were required to endorse the Smokefree Coalition's vision and commit to active participation and collective advocacy within the Coalition. Organisations who were members of the Smokefree Coalition included: {  Action on Smoking and Health (New Zealand) Pacific Heartbeat - Ara Taiohi Pacific Canterbury Trust - The Asian Network Inc (TANI) The Paediatric Society of New Zealand - The Asthma and Respiratory Foundation of New Zealand The Pharmacy Guild of New Zealand - Barnardo's New Zealand Phocus on Health - The Cancer Society of New Zealand Physiotherapy New Zealand - The Cardiac Society of Australia and New Zealand The Problem Gambling Foundation of New Zealand - The College of Nurses Aotearoa (NZ) Inc The Quit Group - Consumer NZ The Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists - Diabetes NZ The Royal Australasian College of Physicians - Family Planning NZ The Royal New Zealand College of General Practitioners - HƒÅpai Te Hauora The Plunket Society - Health Action (Nelson) Smokechange/Innova8 - Healthcare New Zealand Smokefree Nurses Aotearoa NZ - The Health Promotion Forum The Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists - Inspiring Ltd The Stroke Foundation of New Zealand - It's My Life TAHA Well Pacific Mother and Infant - The Lung Foundation of New Zealand Tala Pasifika - The Mental Health Foundation of New Zealand Te Kupenga Hauora Ahuriri - The National Heart Foundation of New Zealand Te Ohu Rata Aotearoa - The New Zealand College of Midwives Te Reo Marama - The New Zealand Dental Association Te Runanga o Aotearoa - The New Zealand Drug Foundation Te Tohu o Te Ora o NgƒÅti Awa - The New Zealand Medical Association The Thoracic Society of Australia and New Zealand (NZ Branch) - The New Zealand Nurses Organisation Whakawhetu/MƒÅori SIDS }  Areas of work  The Smokefree Coalition focused on a range of issue in its work to reduce tobacco use and its health consequences. These included advocacy to achieve: reducing smoking initiation by young people; Opening of Smokefree Coalition's Youth Smoking symposium, Speech by Associate Minister of Health John Luxton, 15 July 1999 limiting allowances for duty-free tobacco; removing the descriptors of 'light' and 'mild' from tobacco branding; banning tobacco advertising and displays at point of retail sale; Time to ban cigarette ads in shops, New Zealand Press Association, 5 March 2009 raising tobacco excise tax; Plain packaging legislation could decrease number of smokers in NZ even further, MƒÅori Television, 28 September 2015 introducing pictorial warnings on tobacco packs; introducing standardised packaging; Government urged to adopt plain packaging for tobacco, Gisborne Herald, 27 October 2015 introducing a register of tobacco retailers; and banning smoking in cars carrying minors.  Smokefree environments  In its early years the Smokefree Coalition made a submission to the Social Services Select Committee in support of the Smoke- free Environments Amendment Bill. This Bill was passed into law in 2003 Smoke- free Environments Amendment Act 2003, New Zealand Parliament and, among other things, banned smoking in New Zealand workplaces, including bars and restaurants. New Zealand was one of the first countries in the world to enact legislation to prevent all workers, including those in hospitality, from the dangers of second-hand smoke. \\"Ireland is not alone in having smoke-free bars. Since March 2004, Norway, New Zealand, Uganda, Bhutan, and Italy, have implemented smoke-free workplace legislation for all workers, including restaurant and bar workers.\\" Smoke-free bars in Ireland: a runaway success. British Medical Journal, 2005 14: 74  'Light' and 'mild' descriptors  In 2007 the Smokefree Coalition complained to the Commerce Commission about comments made by British and American Tobacco about harms from second-hand smoke and about 'light' and 'mild' descriptors in tobacco branding. It argued these descriptors gave the false impression that tobacco products carrying them were less harmful. In response the Commerce Commission warned the tobacco industry against the use of descriptors and accepted an assurance from the tobacco industry that all such descriptors would be removed.; 'Mild' labels to be removed from tobacco, New Zealand Press Association, 31 January 2009  The Smokefree 2025 goal  In 2009 the Smokefree Coalition endorsed the MƒÅori Affairs Select Committee's call for the New Zealand tobacco industry to give an account of the role it plays in causing both sickness and early deaths among MƒÅori. Inquiry into the tobacco industry in Aotearoa and the consequences of tobacco use for MƒÅori, New Zealand Parliament, 3 November 2010 It was this Select Committee's Inquiry Report which inspired the New Zealand Government's commitment to making New Zealand a Smokefree nation by 2025. Smokefree 2025, Ministry of Health (New Zealand), In 2010 the Smokefree Coalition launched Tupeka Kore Aotearoa 2020 Tobacco Free New Zealand 2020 Achieving the Vision. This included a timeline outlining the actions necessary to achieve the vision of New Zealand being smokefree by 2020. This document advocated for regulating tobacco's supply and eliminating demand for tobacco altogether. Later the Smokefree Coalition modified the target date for a smokefree New Zealand from 2020 to 2025 to align with the Government's commitment. However, the Smokefree Coalition was critical of the New Zealand Government for not putting in place a strategy to achieve the 2025 goal. Tobacco smoking decline stalls, Newstalk ZB, 15 December 2015 On 26 May 2016 the Smokefree Coalition organised a protest outside Parliament in Wellington where students lay on the ground as if dead to represent the \\"5000 New Zealanders who die from smoking-related illnesses every year\\". Then Director Dr Prudence Stone said five years [after the announcement of the goal] they were still waiting for a strategy. Students lie in 'deathly silence' outside Parliament in protest against death by smoking, 1 News, 26 May 2016  Smokefree Action Plan 2015‚Äì2018 and Roadmap  In 2015, concerned that New Zealand was not on target to reach the Smokefree 2025 goal, the Smokefree Coalition worked with New Zealand's National Smokefree Working Group to publish a Smokefree National Action Plan and Roadmap for the tobacco control sector. This Action Plan 2015‚Äì2018 and Roadmap set out the key strategic be undertaken before 2018 to place New Zealand back on track to achieve Smokefree 2025 goal. Its 13 stated priorities were: * Deliver comprehensive cessation services tailored to community needs * Increase tobacco control mass media * Utilise the best cessation technologies * Develop a policy response to Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems (ENDS) * Implement standardised tobacco packaging * Increase the price of tobacco products through increased taxation * Restrict tobacco supply * Control tobacco product content * Ensure full implementation of the World Health Organisation's Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC) * Continue expansion of Smokefree environments * Ensure New Zealanders know about and support initiatives required to achieve Smokefree 2025 * Raise public awareness about the tobacco industry's conduct so it mistrusts its information and strategies * Raise public awareness of tobacco addiction so people who smoke are not stigmatised.  Trans Pacific Partnership  In 2016 the Smokefree Coalition backed calls by health professionals to Trade Minister Hon Tim Groser, calling for a comprehensive and independent health impact assessment of the Trans Pacific Partnership Agreement before New Zealand signed it. 'Too much risk' in effects of TPP on public health policy, Radio New Zealand News, 28 March 2016 The Smokefree Coalition's concern was that the Agreement would allow tobacco companies to take countries into international arbitration if they enacted health-based legislation, such as plain packaging requirements, that would impact on those companies' profits or intellectual property. The Coalition believed even the threat of such action could cause New Zealand and other countries to hesitate before enacting policy and laws that would protect the health of their people.  Tobacco Control Update  The Smokefree Coalition produced an e-bulletin, the Tobacco Control Update, each fortnight. This was emailed freely to all members and subscribers and featured: national and international tobacco control news; news from national tobacco control organisations, news from the regions, key events in the tobacco control calendar, updates from Government; tobacco industry activities and future tobacco control directions. The Smokefree Coalition published its last Tobacco Control Update (issue 296) on 22 June 2016. A new fortnightly version of the Tobacco Control Update is now being published by HƒÅpai Te Hauora, which was awarded New Zealand's newly- consolidated (single) smokefree advocacy contract by the Ministry of Health in 2016. The first new edition was published 16 November 2016. Permission was granted by the Smokefree Coalition and the Quit Group to also call this new publication the Tobacco Control Update. Criticism The Smokefree Coalition was criticised for using government funding to engage in advocacy. In 2012 Kiwiblog writer David Farrar said the New Zealand Government should not be \\"effectively paying people to lobby Parliament and the Government a specific way\\" and that NGOs using government money to campaign for what the law should be is the \\"thin end of corruption\\". Taxpayer funded lobbying, Kiwiblog, 14 May 2012 He noted that the Smokefree Coalition received $167,213 in 2011 and 2010 and $179,890 in 2009 from Government, representing 98 percent, 96 percent and 95 percent of its funding in each of those years. In 2016 Whaleoil Blogger Cameron Slater wrote that the Smokefree Coalition and other anti-smoking lobby groups \\"receive an inordinate amount of publicity for their efforts, but governments should not be funding advocacy groups\\". He said anti-smoking lobby groups, including the Smokefree Coalition, had been ineffective with the number of smokers in New Zealand only having dropped from 700,000 to 600,000 in the last five years at a cost of more than $300 million. Closure The Smokefree Coalition ceased operation on 30 June 2016 after a Government decision not to renew the contracts of all tobacco control organisations. Ministry of Health (New Zealand) Smokefree lobbyists face chop, The New Zealand Herald, 27 June 2016 It held its final annual general meeting and ceased being registered as a charitable trust on 30 January 2017. In place of the Smokefree Coalition and other tobacco control organisations the Ministry of Health (New Zealand) awarded a single national anti-smoking advocacy contract to West Auckland-based MƒÅori health agency HƒÅpai Te Hauora.

European Space Agency. 25 August 2017. It will search for organic compounds (carbon-containing molecules) in the collected soil samples. By characterizing the molecular structures of detected organics, MOMA can provide insights into potential molecular biosignatures. MOMA will be able to detect organic molecules at concentrations as low as 10 parts-per-billion by weight (ppbw). MOMA examines solid crushed samples exclusively; it does not perform atmospheric analyses. The Principal Investigator is Fred Goesmann, from the Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research in Germany. Overview The goal of MOMA is to seek signs of past life on Mars (biosignatures) by analysing a wide range of organic compounds that may be found in drilled samples acquired from 2 meters below the Martian surface by the Rosalind Franklin rover. MOMA examines solid crushed samples only; it does not perform atmospheric analyses. MOMA will first volatilize solid organic compounds so that they can be analysed by a mass spectrometer; this volatilisation of organic material is achieved by two different techniques: laser desorption and thermal volatilisation, followed by separation using four GC-MS columns. The identification of the organic molecules is then performed with an ion trap mass spectrometer. Organic biosignatures While there is no unambiguous Martian biosignature to look for, a pragmatic approach is to look out for certain molecules such as lipids and phospholipids that may be forming cell membranes which can be preserved over geological timescales. Lipids and other organic molecules may exhibit biogenic features that are not present in abiogenic organic material. If biogenic (synthesized by a life form), such compounds may be found at high concentrations only over a narrow range of molecular weights, unlike in carbonaceous meteorites where these compounds are detected over a broader range of molecular weights. In the case of sugars and amino acids, excessive molecular homochirality (asymmetry) is another important clue of their biological origin. The assumption is that life on Mars would be carbon-based and cellular as on Earth, so there are expected common building blocks such as chains of amino acids (peptides and proteins) and chains of nucleobases (RNA, DNA, or their analogs). Also, some isomers of high molecular weight organics can be potential biosignatures when identified in context with other supporting evidence. Other compounds targeted for detection will include fatty acids, sterols, and hopanoids. Background organics The surface of Mars is expected to have accumulated significant quantities of large organic molecules delivered by interplanetary dust particles and carbonaceous meteorites. MOMA's characterization of this fraction, may determine not only the abundance of this potential background for trace biomarker detection, but also the degree of decomposition of this matter by radiation and oxidation as a function of depth.Detecting Organics with the Mars Organic Molecule Analyzer (MOMA) on the 2018 ExoMars Rover (PDF). H. Steininger, F. Goesmann, F. Raulin, W. B. Brinckerhoff, MOMA Team. This is essential in order to interpret the samples' origin in the local geological and geochemical context. Development The components of MOMA related to GC-MS have heritage from the Viking landers, the COSAC on board the comet lander Philae, and SAM on board the Curiosity rover. But the methods applied in the past on board the Viking landers and the Curiosity rover are mostly destructive (pyrolysis), and consequently important information of the organic material is lost. Also, only volatile molecules can be detected and, only nonpolar molecules can get through the GC columns to the detector. MOMA will combine pyrolysis‚Äìderivatization with a less destructive method: LDMS (Laser Desorption Mass Spectrometry), which allows large and intact molecular fragments to be detected and characterized by the mass spectrometer (MS).Mars Organic Molecule Analyzer (MOMA) onboard ExoMars 2018 (PDF). Harald Steininger. The LDMS technique is not affected by these drawbacks, and it is unaffected to the presence of perchlorates, known to be abundant on the surface of Mars. Tandem mass spectrometry can then be used to further characterize these molecules. The Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research is leading the development. International partners include NASA. The mass spectrometer (MS) and the main electronics of MOMA are provided by NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, while the gas chromatography (GC) is provided by the two French institutes LISA and LATMOS. The UV-Laser is being developed by the Laser Zentrum Hannover. MOMA does not form a single compact unit, but is modular with numerous mechanical and thermal interfaces within the rover. The final integration and verification will be performed at Thales Alenia Space in Italy. {  - ! Parameter !! Units/performanceTable 1.

Unlike carbene, which usually has a triplet ground state, stannylenes have a singlet ground state since valence orbitals of tin (Sn) have less tendency to form hybrid orbitals and thus the electrons in 5s orbital are still paired up. Free stannylenes are stabilized by steric protection. Adducts with Lewis bases are also known. History The first persistent stannylene, [(Me3Si)2CH]2Sn, was reported by Michael F. Lappert in 1973. Lappert used the same synthetic approach to synthesize the first diamidostannylene [(Me3Si)2N]2Sn in 1974. The short- lived, transient stannylene Me2Sn has been generated by thermolysis of cyclo-(Me2Sn)6. Synthesis and characterization Persistent stannylene Most alkyl stannylenes have been synthesized by alkylation of tin(II) dihalides with organolithium reagents. For example, the first stannylene, [(Me3Si)2CH]2Sn, was synthesized using (Me3Si)2CHLi and SnCl2. Synthesis of stannylene using organolithium reagent In some cases, stannylenes have been prepared by reduction of a tin(IV) compound by KC8 Stannylene synthesis using organolithium and KC8 Amidostannylene can also be synthesized by using a tin(II) dihalide and the lithium amide. Short-lived stannylene The isolation of a transient alkyl stannylene is more difficult. The first isolation of dimethylstannylene was believed to be done by thermolysing cyclostannane (Me2Sn)6, which was the product of the condensation of Me2Sn(NEt2)2 and Me2SnH2. The evidence came from the vibrational frequencies of dimethylstannylene identified by infrared spectroscopy, which is consistent with the calculated value. The existence of this elusive SnMe2 was further confirmed by the discovery of visible light absorption matching the calculated electronic transition of SnMe2 in gas phase. Another method to prepare short-lived stannylene is laser flash photolysis using tetraalkyltin(IV) compound (e.g. SnMe4) as a precursor. The generation of stannylene can be monitored by transient UV-VIS spectroscopy. Structure and bonding Structure of a stannylene from X-ray crystallography. Stannylenes can be viewed as sp2-hybridized with vacant 5p orbital and a lone pair. This gives rise to their red color from n to p transition. With specific type of ligands, the electron deficiency of monomeric stannylene is reduced by the agostic interaction from B-H bond. This concept was proved by Keith Izod and coworkers in 2006 when they synthesized the cyclic dialkylstannylene [{n-Pr2P(BH3)}(Me3Si)CCH2]2Sn. The crystal structure of the synthesized compound showed the arrangement of one B-H bond toward the Sn atom with the B‚ÄîH--Sn bond distance of 2.03 √Ö. The mitigation of Sn electron deficiency was proved by the spectroscopic data, especially the 119Sn NMR spectra which showed the drastically low chemical shift (587 and 787 ppm comparing to 2323 ppm in analogous dialkylstannylene) indicating more electron density around Sn in this case. Reactivity Oligomerization Small, unstable stannylenes (e.g. dimethylstannylene) undergo self-oligomerization yielding cyclic oligostannanes, which can be used as stannylene sources. More bulky stannylenes (e.g. Lappert's stannylene), on the other hand, tend to form a dimer. The nature of the Sn-Sn bond in stannylene dimer is rather different from C-C bond in carbene dimer (i.e. alkene). As alkene develops a typical double bond character and the molecule has a planar geometry, stannylene dimer has a trans-bent geometry. The double bond in stannylene dimer can be considered as two donor-acceptor interactions. The electron localization function (ELF) analysis of stannylene dimer shows a disynaptic basin (electrons in bonding orbitals) on both Sn atom, indicating that the interaction between two Sn atom is two unusual bent dative bonds. Apart from that, the stability of stannylene dimer is also affected by the steric repulsion and dispersion attraction between bulky substituents. Double donor-acceptor interaction diagram in dimethylstannylene dimer Insertion reaction Alkylstannylenes can react with various reagents (e.g. alkyl halides, enones, dienes) in an oxidative addition (or insertion) fashion. The reaction between stannylene and 9,10-phenanthrolinedione produces an EPR signal that was identified to be 9,10-phenanthrenedione radical anion, indicating that this reaction proceeds via radical mechanism. Oxidative addition of ethyl iodide to a stannylene. Cycloaddition Although stannylenes are more stable than its lighter carbene analogs, they readily undergo [2+4] cycloaddition reaction with Z-alkenes.

As Per√≥n arrived to Argentina in June 1973 Tendencia Revolucionaria suffered a major rift as some considered that any armed struggle was no longer needed while others insisted on its necessity. Another seback came on January 20, 1974 when People's Revolutionary Army attacked the Azul garrison. This resulted in Per√≥n criticizing Bidegain who resigned after facing pressure from the Camber of Deputies. To the dismay of Tendencia Revolucionaria Victorio Calabr√≥ succeeded him as governor.

Tested in late 1954, the project was found to be unfeasible from the standpoint of accuracy, and the project was terminated the following year. Design and development Alongside the WS-119L program to develop long-distance, high-altitude balloons for aerial reconnaissance, the United States Air Force initiated WS-124A in early 1953 to develop a method of delivering weaponry to targets in the Soviet Union using hydrogen balloons;Peebles 1991, p.128. such a capability was considered potentially valuable in the event of a limited nuclear conflict, or in a \\"broken-back\\" scenario following a massive nuclear exchange.Peebles 1991, p.131. The WS-124A balloons were intended to fly at altitudes of roughly , within the jet stream; as weather forecasts were considered to be sufficiently accurate to forecast approximately three days of wind patterns, the design flight duration was for 60 hours, in which they were expected to cover a distance of . The WS-124A balloon was designed to be capable of launching in wind speeds of up to .Parsch 2006 It was accepted that there would be an inherent inaccuracy in the concept; the expected target area was by ,Peebles 1991, p.129. which was considered acceptable as the designed payloads involved chemical and biological weaponry, although incendiary bombs, for starting forest fires, were also considered as a payload. It was believed that releasing chemical or biological agents from the balloons could contaminate an area \\"comparable in size to that affected by a low-yield nuclear weapon\\". Some sources claim that dirty bombs were also considered for carriage by WS-124A.Christopher 2004, p.184. In addition, the ability of the balloons to spread propaganda leaflets across enemy territory was considered useful. Operational history Flight tests of the WS-124A balloon system started on 8 October 1954; by 13 December, 41 balloons had been launched, 25 of which were fully operational test flights. Even allowing for the expected inaccuracy, however, only six of the balloons reached their intended target area, while five more were considered to be close enough. This was not considered an acceptable level of accuracy, and in August 1955 the WS-124A program was cancelled the conclusion being that the weather forecasts were simply not accurate enough for the system to be operationally feasible.

By August 1857 a correspondent for The Sydney Morning Herald described how \\"bark and comfortable slab huts [had taken] the place of calico tents, and a little village [had] sprung up\\". This early account of Merrendee describes the village as being made up of \\"an excellent building ... being erected for a public house, and Mr. F. B. Gulley's new store, a neat pine building with verandah, fitted out quite in the Sydney style ... [as well as] ... a very neat and substantial slab store\\". The first General Publicans' License in Merrendee was issued for \\"the house situated at Merindee [sic], in the district of Avisford, to be known as the Cricketers Arms\\". The license was granted to Joseph Cox and transferred to a Mr. Jones in May 1863. Other licensed establishments in the town included Richard Knight's \\"Merrendee Inn\\" (c1858) and Robert Forbes Milne's \\"Royal George Inn\\" (c1858).

He was one of four African American state legislators elected in Indiana in the 19th century. Early life and education Bassett was born in 1846 at Snow Hill, North Carolina, to free black parents. In 1848, he moved with his parents to a Quaker community in Parke County, Indiana. There his father, Zachariah Bassett, first began to preach. Both Richard and his brother Miles would follow their father into the ministry. In 1856, the Bassetts, along with the Artis and Ellis families, established a new African-American settlement in Ervin Township in Howard County. Known as the Bassett Settlement, the community grew to 11 families, and at its peak had its own school, church, and post office, as well as a general store and blacksmith shop. Bassett attended local Quaker schools. Bassett formally joined the Free Union Baptist Church at the Bassett Settlement in November 1864. In 1864, Bassett married Ann Hawkins, with whom he subsequently had six children. Upon her death in 1876, he married Nancy A. Hamilton, with whom he had four children. She died in 1888, and he later married Luvinie Reed in 1891. Career In August 1867, Bassett was ordained a Baptist minister at New Albany, Indiana. In his subsequent career, churches where he served as minister included the Shiloh Church of Rising Sun (his first posting), the Second Church of New Albany (eight years), the Corinthian Baptist Church of Indianapolis (five years), the Free Union Baptist Church at the Bassett settlement, and the Second Church of Kokomo. (The Second Church of Kokomo served as the successor to the Free Union Baptist Church, which closed in the 1880s.) Bassett was particularly known for his work in the Sunday School movement, and was appointed \\"state Sunday-school missionary\\" in 1888. In 1892, Bassett was elected to the Indiana House of Representatives from Howard County. He served one term. He was the third African American legislator ever elected in Indiana, after James Sidney Hinton and James Matthew Townsend. Staunchly religious, his vote in opposition to a resolution supporting the 1893 World's Fair being open on Sundays attracted attention. Due to illness, however, he did not participate fully in the 1893 legislative session, and was obliged to be absent for part of it. Bassett's final post was at the Mount Zion Baptist Church in Indianapolis, where he served from 1900 to 1903. In 1903, he suffered a stroke which ended his preaching career. Upon his death, plans were laid for a monument to be erected in Bassett's memory in Kokomo; it was to have been dedicated in 1906.

Andy Burke scored the match-winning goal for UCLA in the 167th minute, which to date, is the longest-ever NCAA soccer game.  Review  Sigi Schmid coached the Bruins to their first NCAA championship. The 1985 team is best known as being the first UCLA soccer team to win the NCAA title, winning 1-0 over American University at the now- demolished Kingdome, in Seattle on December 14, 1985. The season saw the Bruins only lose one match the entire season, a 2-1 decision against the Fresno State Bulldogs in Northridge, California on September 25. During the 1985 NCAA Division I Men's Soccer Tournament, the Bruins only conceded one goal, in the semifinals at Evansville on a penalty kick by Chris Machold. The win against Evansville, sent the Bruins to their first NCAA championship match since 1973, ending a 12-year drought in terms of appearances. The championship match, clocking in at 166 minutes and five seconds, is, by far, the longest NCAA Division I Men's Championship Game match in history. The match involved a record-breaking eight overtimes (this was prior to the penalty kick shoot-out rule that was subsequently implemented). At the time, overtime consisted of five-minute sudden death overtime periods. This caused broken run-of-play. In the 167th minute, Andy Burke, who had hardly played much of the season, came on to the pitch to score the match-winning goal against American, locking UCLA with their first ever NCAA championship. Burke made himself open to receive a through pass from Krumpe and scored on a far-post shot from 13 yards out. The goal was his first ever as a Bruin. Schmid said on the game: \\"Andy hadn‚Äôt played much that year. Before the game, his dad had read an article in the Wall Street Journal that talked about how the last guy, the most unexpected person, is the one who makes the biggest contribution sometimes. He had relayed that message to Andy the day before, and the next day Andy went out and made the biggest contribution. Anytime you win a championship, it obviously takes a special place. This one ranks right up there with all of the other championships. The first one is always a little special, though, because it‚Äôs the first one.

The box is also referred to as \\"memento box\\" in Otogiz≈çshi texts., Urashimatar≈ç in: Otogiz≈çshi, Modern version The tamatebako appears in the story of \\"Urashima Tar≈ç\\", whose modern version are generally all based on the national textbook., citing Miura (1989), p. 21 It is told that Urashima Tar≈ç the fisherman was invited to a sea palace (Ry≈´g≈´ or Dragon Palace) by the princess (Otohime) after saving a turtle., translation of 3rd edition national textbook as primary source #13.\\"Sea Palace\\" or Ry≈´g≈´ ; \\"princess\\" or Otohime, p. 104. He spent a number of days, fed and entertained and upon his leaving received the tamatebako (\\"treasure box\\": \\"beautiful box\\", \\"treasure box\\"; p. 107: \\"tamatebako\\".) with explicit instructions to never open the box. When he returned, his parents had died and he recognized no one. In dismay he forgot the princess's caution. When he opened the tamatebako, a white puff of smoke escaped, and he was transformed into an old, white haired man. It is understood during the short time he spent at the Dragon Palace, many years had elapsed in the world back home. Otohime had stored his old age away in the tamatebako, which Urashima Tar≈ç released. Seki's variant A is given to Urashima Tar≈ç and the princess actually encourages him to use it in the moment of need. This is what occurs in \\"Urashima Taro\\" variant collected by Keigo Seki, a telling from Nakatado District, Kagawa., reprinted in: When he opened the lid of the box, the first box contained crane's feather; the second box issued a puff of white smoke that transformed him into an old man; the third box held a mirror for him to look at himself. The feather from the first box then fastened itself on his back, now transforming Urashima into a crane, and the princess appeared in the guise of a turtle to see him. A version with the three-tiered \\"Tamatebako\\" (jeweled hand-box) was also published in English by the Japanese foreign ministry in 1969. Early versions The box is referred to as \\"comb box\\" in a precursor tale, recorded as historical in the Fudoki of Tango Province, where the principal character is known by the slightly different name, Ura-no-Shimako, and the female identifies herself as a member of the immortals. Shimako's visit to the Horaisan (Mount Penglai) or \\"Tokoyo- no-kuni\\" (\\"Timeless Land\\" or \\"Land of Eternity\\") lasts three years, at the end of which he is given the box as a gift. The legend in the Many≈çsh≈´ refers also to a , translated \\"jewel-casket\\" by Aston, which Urashima receives from the lady or daughter of the Sea-God (Watatsumi). Poem and expression In several of the Otogiz≈çshi texts of Urashima Tar≈ç is inserted the waka poem which is an allusion to Urashima: : :\\"The night of meet you [is like] Urashima opening the tametebako, [when night turns to dawn] the regret and my tears\\"., Urashimatar≈ç in: Otogiz≈çshi, : \\"(Â§ßÊÑè)ÊÅã‰∫∫„Å´„ÅÇ„ÅÜÂ§ú„ÅØ„ÄÅÊµ¶Â≥∂„ÅÆÁéâÊâãÁÆ±„ÅÆ„Çà„ÅÜ„Å™„ÇÇ„ÅÆ„Åß„ÄÅÂ§ú„ÅåÊòé„Åë„Çã„Å®ÊÇ≤„Åó„Åè„Å™„ÇäÊ∂ô„ÅåÂá∫„Çã„ÄÇ\\" (modern Japanese paraphrase) The \\"akete kuyashiki\\" in the poem might be restated as \\"mortified by the opening\\" of the box. The poem led to the common stock phrase \\"opened to his regret (mortification), the tamatebako\\". Local legends A Tamatebako is enshrined in the Urashima Jinja in the Tango Peninsula in northern Kyoto Prefecture.

It is located in the village of Mykland. It is the church for the Froland parish which is part of the Arendal prosti (deanery) in the Diocese of Agder og Telemark. The white, wooden church was built in an octagonal style in 1832 by the architect Gunder Olsen. The church seats about 150 people. History Prior to 1683, the residents of the Mykland area had to travel to the stave church in nearby Vegusdal to worship. The King sent a letter to the people of Mykland on 20 December 1681 to inform them that they had permission to build a church in their parish wherever they felt was best. So, in 1683, a church was built in Mykland. It was a timber framed church using wood from the abundant forests in the area. The church bell was cast in the Netherlands (and it was saved and used in the present church). The church had rows of pews that were assigned to each farm in the parish, with men and women sitting on either side of the church. In 1723, the church was sold at a public auction by King Frederick IV to help the finances of the Kingdom of Denmark-Norway after the Great Northern War. The church was owned privately from 1723 until 1806. In 1827, when the Bishop was visiting the church, it was decided that the church was too small for the parish, so planning began for a new church. The old church was demolished and the new church was constructed on the same site. The new church was completed in 1832. The residents wanted an octagonal church like the nearby Hornnes Church and √Ördal Church, so they hired Gunder Olsen as the architect and lead builder since he had worked on both of those other churches.

No one knows when the first church was built or how many churches have been located at this site, but in 1704 there was a royal resolution that stipulated that the old church be torn down and replaced. However, Bishop Jens Bircherod would not allow the church to be torn before the financing for the new was in order. He asked every farm to deliver timber for the new church. During the demolition of the old church, old idols were found which were thrown into the nearby river.

The Act imposed a requirement of obtaining emigration clearance (also called POE clearance) from the office of Protector of Emigrants (POE), Ministry of Overseas Indian Affairs for people emigrating from India for work. As of 2017, this requirement applies only for people going to one of 18 listed countries.  Background  Indians emigrated, both temporarily and permanently, to a number of countries, including the United States, United Kingdom, Germany, Canada, Australia, and the economies of south-east Asia. The bulk of emigration from the 1970s onward was to the Arab states of the Persian Gulf. Recruiting agents played a role in connecting workers to foreign jobs and charged the workers or the employers some share of the revenue. The Emigration Act, 1983 was passed to address concerns related to defrauding and exploitation of workers by the recruiting agents and other problems they might face upon going abroad.  Provisions   Creation of the office of Protector of Emigrants (Chapter II)  Chapter II, Section 3 of the Act provided that the Central Government may appoint a Protector General of Emigrants and as many Protectors of Emigrants (POE) as it sees fit, as well as their respective areas of operation. Later Sections of Chapter II defined the duties of Protectors of Emigrants in more detail, provided for emigration check-points, and provided for other emigration officers.  Registration of recruiting agents (Chapter III)  The Act made the Protector General of Emigrants and other Protectors of Emigrants the authorities who could register recruiting agents. A person could operate as a recruiting agent for emigrants only if registered. The Act also provided details on the application, terms and conditions, renewal, and cancellation of registration.  Permits for recruitment by employers (Chapter IV)  All employers were required to recruit either through a recruiting agent with a valid registration, or obtain a permit for recruitment. The procedure for obtaining, validity period, and cancellation of permits was detailed in the law.  Emigration clearance (Chapter V)  Any citizen of India seeking to emigrate was required to have emigration clearance from the Protectorate of Emigrants (POE). The application process for emigration clearance, and potential grounds for rejection, were detailed. As of 2017, passport holders could either have ECR status (emigration check required) in which case they need to obtain emigration clearance, or have ECNR status (emigration check not required) in which case they do not need to obtain emigration clearance. The ECR/ECNR distinction does not appear to have been stated in the original language of the Emigration Act, 1983, which seems to suggest that anybody emigrating for work is required to obtain emigration clearance. The requirements for getting to ECNR status have been progressively relaxed over time, starting from being restricted to people such as graduates and income tax payers and now applying to a much wider set of people including those who have completed matriculation (class 10 of school).

It is critically endangered, possibly extinct, and one of only fifteen protists evaluated by IUCN. Endemic to the Gal√°pagos Islands, the specific epithet tropica alludes to its tropical habitat, rare for members of Desmarestiales. The common name acidweed applies to members of the genus Desmarestia, generally characterized by fronds containing vacuoles of concentrated sulfuric acid, but it is unclear if this species also produces acid. History D. tropica was first collected by William Randolph Taylor on 19 January 1935, and twice more later that month. He published a description of the species ten years later in May 1945. The organism was last collected in 1972, and not seen since despite efforts to search the sighted locations and other possible habitats in the archipelago. Because of its preference for deep, cold water in a tropical location, it was likely severely affected by El Ni√±o, especially the 1982‚Äì83 El Ni√±o event. This event killed much of the macroalgae in the area, and D. tropica likely declined from overgrazing by herbivores resulting from El Ni√±o and overfishing of predator fish. There is a small possibility that the species still lives in deeper water in a cryptic gametophyte stage, but if so it has yet to return to the more visible sporophyte stage. The gametophyte has also never been observed. Description The thallus of D. tropica can be about tall and is soft, bushy, and light brown in color. The holdfast is tiny and not very differentiated. The stipe is in diameter and short, fleshy, and firm. It continues up as the rachis where it flattens out, only visible underneath the blade, and widens to . Opposite branching starts from the base with wide- angled branches every , and continues from each branch for several degrees. The blades have short, broad teeth which on the younger blades include short brown filaments. These filaments are oppositely branched. D. tropica differs from D. latifrons by being more bushy and having more of a gradation in branches from the apex to the base. The branches are also more expansive in D. tropica than in D. latifrons or similar species. D. tropica is in the section Herbacea of Desmarestia, but compared to other North American species it is less membranous. Habitat Tropical acidweed has been found in only two locations: Post Office Bay off Floreana Island and Caleta Tagus (Tagus Cove) off Isabela Island. At the former site it was found at depths from . It was once thought to be found off the mainland coast of Peru, but these specimens are considered instead to be D. firma. Despite its tropical range, it prefers the cold, deep water of upwelling areas of the lower sublittoral zone.

He also played offensive guard for the Nebraska Cornhuskers from 2003-2007. In August 2018, David was nominated as part of ESPN's '40 Under 40.' Early life Austin was born on November 19, 1983 in Houston, Texas at St. Luke's Hospital to Jacqueline L. Austin and Gregory D. Austin Sr. David attended Cy-Fair High School in Cypress, Texas where he played football and a shot putter for the track and field team was elected homecoming king. While at Cy-Fair, his nickname was \\"BG,\\" or \\"Big Greg \\" due his popularity and leadership qualities among his teammates, peers, coaches and teachers. He eventually committed to a football scholarship at the University of Nebraska upon graduating in 2003. Other prospects included North Texas, Oklahoma State, Rice, SMU and Texas Tech. College career Upon visiting Nebraska's campus in November 2002 and being heavily recruited by head coach Frank Solich, he signed a letter of intent to play for the Huskers in spring of 2003. David earned a spot that fall as a true starter on Solich's offensive line. He was the fifth true freshman in Nebraska's history to ever do so. His offensive teammates that year included Jammal Lord and his roommate Cory Ross. Despite a knee injury that sidelined him in late season, the Cornhuskers went on to win the Alamo Bowl his first year against Michigan State. Austin retained his starting offensive line role throughout his tenure at Nebraska as they reclaimed victory two years later at the Alamo Bowl against Michigan. This time, it was under new head coach Bill Callahan. In his final year, the Huskers, including starting running back and roommate Brandon Jackson, fell in a close game to Auburn in the 2007 Cotton Bowl Classic. He graduated in 2007 from Nebraska with a Bachelors in Business Administration. Other teammates included Titus Adams, Joe Dailey, Sam Koch, Carl Nicks, Ndamukong Suh, Barrett Ruud, Zac Taylor, and Fabian Washington. Shortly after graduating from Nebraska, under the tutelage of Richard Lapchick and Richard DeVos, David enrolled at the University of Central Florida where he studied under the DeVos Sports Management Program. Austin credited Lapchick and DeVos on matriculating to UCF by saying their societal contributions, \\"really drew me in, and from there, I knew it was bigger than me.\\" He graduated from UCF in 2009 with dual master's degrees in business sports management. Coaching career Early career Austin's coaching career began shortly after graduating from UCF where he also worked as an event manager for Disney's Wide World of Sports. He took an intern graduate assistant coaching position at both Mesabi Range College and later Wayne State University. At both schools, he assisted with the offensive line as an intern coach. Oregon In mid-2010, Austin received an offer to join Chip Kelly's coaching staff as a graduate assistant intern for the University of Oregon.

Early life and education Timmes was born in Innsbruck, Austria where his father, an American doctor was pursuing advanced studies. His family returned to the United States, living in New York City. Timmes attended Fordham University, graduating with a law degree in 1932 and practiced as a lawyer in New York for the next seven years. Career Timmes was called to active duty in 1939. World War II 300px Lt. Col. Timmes was commander of the 2nd Battalion, 507th Parachute Infantry Regiment which was dropped on Mission Boston, part of the American airborne landings in Normandy on the morning of 6 June 1944. The 2/507th was tasked with securing the western end of the La Fi√®re bridge approximately 3km from Sainte-M√®re- √âglise, however his battalion had been widely scattered during the drop landing in grassing swampland along the Merderet river, by the end of the day Timmes controlled a group of approximately 100 men in defensive positions in an orchard. On 8 June German forces launched 4 separate attacks on Timmes' position, all of which were repulsed. A request for support was sent to the 82nd Airborne Division headquarters and a battalion from the 325th Glider Infantry Regiment was sent as reinforcements and Timmes then launched attacks on the German positions and the La Fi√®re causeway. On 9 June the 325th attacked German positions at Cauquigny but were beaten back and withdrew to the orchard which came under renewed attack by the Germans before they were relieved later that day. The site of the battle is now known at Timmes Orchard and monuments to the 507th, the 325th and the 508th have been erected nearby. The 507th Parachute Infantry Regiment was transferred to the 17th Airborne Division on its return to England in July 1944. Timmes again led the 2/507th in Operation Varsity in March 1945. Post World War II After the war Timmes studied the Russian language at the Army's Defense Language Institute at the Presidio of Monterey, California and Russian history at Columbia University. These studies prevented him from taking part in the Korean War. Timmes received a master's degree in political theory from Georgetown University and graduated from the Command and General Staff College, Armed Forces Staff College, and the National War College. Timmes then served in South Korea from November 1956 until March 1958 and as an intelligence officer in Washington D.C. Timmes was assistant commander of the 101st Airborne Division from March 1959 to May 1961. Vietnam War In July 1961, Timmes was sent to South Vietnam, where he served as deputy to Military Assistance Advisory Group (MAAG) chief Lt. Gen. Lionel C. McGarr. When McGarr left this post in March 1962, Timmes succeeded him and remained in this post until 15 May 1964 when MAAG was subsumed into Military Assistance Command, Vietnam. Timmes remained in South Vietnam until July 1964. During this period Timmes built relations with many of the Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) officers who would play important roles during the war including General D∆∞∆°ng VƒÉn Minh. On 15 November 1963 Timmes announced that 1000 U.S. advisers would be withdrawn in December, bringing the number of advisers down to 15,500. After retiring from the Army Timmes joined the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and returned to South Vietnam in 1967 where his role was liaison with the South Vietnamese leadership and ARVN commanders, many of whom he knew when they were junior officers during his earlier tour in Vietnam. Timmes renewed his friendship with D∆∞∆°ng VƒÉn Minh and they often played tennis together at the Cercle Sportif. Timmes acted as a go-between for the US Embassy and the South Vietnamese Government during the Fall of Saigon and was instrumental in facilitating the resignation of President Nguy·ªÖn VƒÉn Thi·ªáu on 21 April and the ascent of D∆∞∆°ng VƒÉn Minh to the presidency on 27 April in the hope that he would be able to negotiate a ceasefire with the North Vietnamese. On 25 April 1975 Timmes and fellow CIA agent Frank Snepp escorted former President Thi·ªáu to Tan Son Nhat International Airport where Thi·ªáu boarded a plane that would take him into exile. On 29 April, Timmes was evacuated from the U.S. Embassy during Operation Frequent Wind on the same helicopter as Frank Snepp. Later life After retiring from the CIA in 1975, Timmes worked for the Washington law firm Altmann & Vitt. Timmes died on 20 October 1990 in Falls Church, Virginia and was buried at Arlington National Cemetery.

Tested in the fall of 1993, it was considered successful but was not ordered into production. Design and development Begun in 1991,Naval Research Laboratory Review, 1992, p.106. the Flyrt program was intended to produce an expendable decoy drone, not requiring any new aboardship infrastructure, for the defense of warships against radar-guided antiship missiles. It produced a drone that was of conventional configuration, having a low-mounted, folding wing and a cruciform tail section; an electric motor was mounted in the nose of the aircraft. Launch was via a rocket booster, providing 1.6 seconds of thrust,Parsch 2006. from the Mark 137 launcher of the Mark 36 SRBOC system; the use of the Mark 36 launcher put a constraint on the possible size of the drone,Naval Research Laboratory Review, 1994, p.139. which was designed to compact into a package the size of a standard NATO Mark 36 chaff rocket. The tail fins would unfold immediately on launch, while the wing would deploy and motor start after burnout as the aircraft coasted to the apogee of a ballistic trajectory. The expendable Flyrt carried a radio repeater with two antennae for spoofing enemy radar signals. Operational history Following a series of ballistic tests to verify compatibility of the launcher,Naval Research Laboratory Review, 1994, p.141. the Flyrt trial program moved to full-scale tests of the vehicle, with the drone's first flight coming on 9 September 1993. Thirteen drones were constructed for the program, conducted at the NRL's Chesapeake Bay Detachment, which was considered successful; however, no production was undertaken.

It is the 23rd overall episode of the series and is written by Greg Plageman & Jonathan Nolan and directed by Richard J. Lewis. It aired on CBS in the United States and on CTV in Canada on May 17, 2012. Plot Finch (Michael Emerson) calls Carter (Taraji P. Henson), asking her to help Reese (Jim Caviezel). However, she is debriefed by Agent Donnelly (Brennan Brown) on their newest information: they've managed to locate Reese, who is seen escorting a woman in the streets. A day ago, Reese and Finch receive a new number: Caroline Turing (Amy Acker), a psychologist. Reese begins surveillance on her by posing as a patient. Meanwhile, Fusco (Kevin Chapman) is summoned by HR and meets with councilman Larsson (Wayne Duvall) and Officer Patrick Simmons (Robert John Burke), who state that they will work in a murder for hire. An anonymous client assigned them to kill Turing and Fusco is notified to obstruct any investigation from the NYPD. Reese gets in contact with Zoe Morgan (Paige Turco), who manages to get him information regarding any threat against Turing. Reese saves Turing from being killed by assailants in the street and takes her to a hotel for safety. His face is detected by the cameras and the FBI conduct an investigation and strike team to catch Reese. The hotel is surrounded by FBI operatives looking for Reese as well as HR members looking for Turing. With the help from Carter (Taraji P. Henson), Reese and Turing manage to evade the corps. While Finch assists in hacking the system, Alicia Corwin (Elizabeth Marvel) breaks into the Library. Zoe interrogates one of the threats and finds that the person was blackmailed to act as a threat to Turing by an unknown benefactor. Reese manages to get Turing to escape the hotel through a water plant to reach Finch while he holds the HR shooters. Carter and Fusco arrive and help him chase HR in a high speed chase but Reese uses a detonator he hid earlier to explode HR's car. Finch waits for Turing in his car when he is confronted at gunpoint by Corwin, who demands him to shut down the Machine. Suddenly, Corwin is shot in the head by Turing. Just as Zoe sneaks into Turing's office, her records are getting deleted, discovering that Turing is in fact \\"Root\\". Root was the person who hired HR to plan her own murder, which would make her a person of interest, as the real target was Finch. Reese arrives at Finch's location only to find Corwin's corpse. Fusco manages to send evidence to the NYPD about HR, managing the arrest of the mole inside the corp. Reese goes to a public surveillance camera, talking directly to the Machine, asking it to help him find Finch. A payphone rings nearby and Reese answers it. Reception Viewers In its original American broadcast, \\"Firewall\\" was seen by an estimated 13.47 million household viewers and gained a 2.5/7 ratings share among adults aged 18‚Äì49, according to Nielsen Media Research. This was a 4% increase in viewership from the previous episode, which was watched by 12.96 million viewers with a 2.6/7 in the 18-49 demographics. With these ratings, Person of Interest was the most watched show on CBS for the night beating The Mentalist, and Rules of Engagement, second on its timeslot and fourth for the night in the 18-49 demographics, behind Grey's Anatomy, a rerun of The Big Bang Theory, and American Idol. Critical reviews \\"Firewall\\" received mostly positive reviews from critics. Matt Fowler of IGN gave the episode a \\"great\\" 8.5 out of 10 and wrote, \\"'Firewall' was exciting, sure. And it felt like a lot of things were converging/culminating on an FBI hunt/HR level. But I think the biggest thing it had going for it, aside from the 'Root' reveal at the end, was Fusco and Carter finally finding out that they're both on the same side. In many respects, this first season was an exercise in team-building; creating a full pre-crime fighting support system while also enriching the bond between Reese and Finch. Now they can head into Season 2 as more of a force.\\" Phil Dyess- Nugent of The A.V. Club gave the episode a \\"B+\\" grade and wrote, \\"Person Of Interest has devoted some of its recent episodes to humanizing Reese and Finch by revealing what shame they keep bottled up inside and what losses they've suffered, and while some of this has been effective, the show might be bloodless and ice-cold if it weren't for the characters on the margins, who aren't as free of doubt and technical perfection as its heroes. Few series characters have been introduced in as imperfect form as Kevin Chapman's Fusco, but over the course of the season, he's grown from a singularly charmless, one-dimensional corrupt cop into a man relearning how good it feels to do good, and in the process, turned into the heart of the show.\\" Keysha Couzens of TV Overmind wrote \\"This first season of Person of Interest has been driven almost completely by the omnipotent presence of technology and its many uses to be both a blessing and a bane to man's existence. For the purposes of the series, it brought Reese and Finch together to help people, and now it has separated them in the season's final moments as the Machine has finally fallen into the wrong hands.\\" Luke Gelineau of TV Equals wrote \\"This is it, you guys! Person of Interest is ending its solid first season with tonight's episode: 'Firewall'. Reese and Finch have been through a lot in the last 22 episodes, and it looks like it's all coming to a head in tonight‚Äôs finale.\\" Sean McKenna of TV Fanatic gave the episode a 4.9 star rating out of 5 and wrote \\"The finale delivered a fantastic cap to that season illustrating everything that's great about the show, while simply turning it on its head, incorporating clever twists, and showing that it's only scratched the surface of its capabilities.\\"  References  External links * \\"Firewall\\" at CBS * * \\"Firewall\\" at TV Guide * Category:Person of Interest (TV series) episodes Category:2012 American television episodes ","title":"Firewall (Person of Interest)"},{"id":"56019857","text":"\\"Sous le ciel de Paris\\" is a song initially written for the 1951 French film Sous le ciel de Paris, directed by Julien Duvivier.

During the colonial period, homosexuality was punished for being considered unnatural and contrary to the Christian God, and the \\"sodomy\\" of the Mapuche people was used as a justification for war. Since its independence, Argentina followed the trend of moral, medical and psychiatric repression that characterized Western culture in general. The 1960s and early 1970s saw the emergence of the first LGBT social movements and rights organizations in the country‚Äîwhich were pioneering in Ibero-America‚Äîincluding Nuestro Mundo (English: Our World) in 1967 and the Frente de Liberaci√≥n Homosexual (English: Homosexual Liberation Front) in 1972. The 1976 military dictatorship eradicated the movement and many of its members were forcedly disappeared. With the return of democracy in 1983, a new LGBT movement emerged in the country, with important advancements during the 1990s. In 2010, Argentina became the second in the Americas, and the tenth in the world to legalize same-sex marriage. Transgender rights in Argentina are among the most advanced in the world: its Gender Identity Law, passed in 2012, made Argentina the \\"only country that allows people to change their gender identities without facing barriers such as hormone therapy, surgery or psychiatric diagnosis that labels them as having an abnormality\\". BBC Mundo reported in 2014 that \\"Argentina leads the trans revolution in the world\\", and in 2015 the World Health Organization cited Argentina as an exemplary country for providing transgender rights. In Pew Research Center's 2013 Global Attitudes Survey, Argentina was the South American country with the most positive societal attitudes towards homosexuality, with about three- quarters (74%) of those surveyed saying it should be accepted.

Production and thematic notes  If One of These Bottles Should Happen to Fall, released in 1999, was produced and mixed by Scott Miller, a California pop musician who led the groups Game Theory and The Loud Family, and who was McCall's \\"musical hero\\" until Miller's death in 2013. According to McCall, \\"Some of the basics were tracked in New York, but most of the recording was done in his San Bruno, California living room. He was extremely generous with his time, his insight, and his guidance\\". McCall credited David Schreiber (guitar, bass guitar), who accompanied McCall on trips to the San Francisco Bay Area to make the record, as his \\"principal collaborator during these sessions.\\" According to McCall, \\"While the tone of the album is lighthearted, a few of the heavier themes that would later obsess me are apparent here: geography as destiny, gentrification, the pathos of the politician, capitalist activity as a glorified gambling addiction, distaste for drugs and alcohol, long looks askance at the big city across the Hudson.\\" While selecting songs from McCall's demos, Miller drew McCall toward the \\"conceptual unity\\" of a set of songs centering on the political, emotional, and civic life of New Jersey. Describing the prominence of New Jersey life and politics in McCall's songwriting, The New York Times wrote, \\"Mr. McCall's songs are the opposite of a Jersey joke. In his songs, New Jersey is the center of the world, without apology.\\" McCall described his musical attitude as \\"the Jersey way; we wear our hearts on our sleeves... I'm trying to tap into the way that civic and public life makes me feel and the way it makes other people feel,\\" resulting in what the New York Times described as CDs \\"informed at their core by a sense of intense Jersey-tude.\\" According to The Brooklyn Rail, McCall's strength is social commentary: in contrast to Bruce Springsteen's \\"boardwalks, arcades, and cheap little seaside bars,\\" McCall offers \\"an alternative New Jersey mythology, which is more urban, urbane, and ironic, than Springsteen's, but no less captivating.\\" Songs McCall opened the 1999 CD with \\"The New Jersey Department of Public Works,\\" a song about \\"an imaginary but incredibly noble state agency.\\" In the song, McCall set out to create \\"a gauzily-remembered fictional New Deal-type program, representing the kind of togetherness and industrial positivism that we imagine the 1930s and 1940s were like. It's an imaginary echo of an imaginary government department, one that unified state residents through collective building projects. It's supposed to sound like a dimly-remembered ideal, a dream of political and social cohesion achieved through identification with the state.\\" McCall stated that the first two songs served as a \\"double intro,\\" with \\"The New Jersey Department of Public Works\\" and \\"Janie Abstract\\" representing \\"New Jersey as I might have dreamt it, followed by New Jersey as I actually see it.\\" In contrast to the opening track, \\"Janie Abstract\\" depicted present-day \\"strip highways and commercial retrofitting of old retail establishments, class conflict, fragmentation, the haves and have-nots of modern technology, misrepresentation and aggressive development plans, postmodernity.\\" \\"The View from New Jersey\\" depicts a woman downsized from her job and \\"forced to move from Manhattan to Hoboken,\\" who \\"equates her rejection by the corporate machine and exile with personal failure.\\" McCall's sincere narrator, in a sort of therapeutic counseling, seems to suggest that \\"New Jersey offers opportunities for self-reinvention ... autonomy and self-governance,\\" and before he's through, \\"she's glad she stayed.... It's a song that encourages listeners to bear the pain of estrangement from mainstream values.\\" Many of McCall's songs contain references to New Jersey politicians; examples include \\"Dear Governor Kean\\" and a litany of names mentioned in \\"It's Not The Money, It's The Principle.\\" A glossary identifying the names of Hudson County politicians and local haunts was included with the If One of These Bottles CD. Critical reception Music critic Joe Harrington, in his 2002 book Sonic Cool: The Life & Death of Rock 'n' Roll, called If One of These Bottles \\"the best Elvis Costello album since Armed Forces\\", and cited McCall as a \\"master of the same kind of intricate wordplay as Dylan and Costello.\\" Harrington added that McCall's \\"self-deprecating manner\\" and his \\"jovial, and thus more philosophically insightful\\" approach to songwriting and performance \\"upsets people's notions about what a 'folk' singer constitutes,\\" as did the early Bob Dylan. The Brooklyn Rail, which cited \\"social commentary\\" as McCall's forte, wrote that \\"The View from New Jersey\\" is not only the album's \\"most memorable\\" song, but \\"may be the greatest New Jersey rock song since Springsteen's 'Thunder Road'. But whereas the Boss's song was all about leaving New Jersey ... McCall's song is about settling down.\\" The reviewer added that McCall also writes \\"touching, if sardonic, love songs\\", to the point that \\"Missing You\\" nearly \\"seems to be channeling Cole Porter\\". Track listing Personnel McCall provided lead vocals and played synthesizer. Other musicians appearing on the album included Jens Carstensen on drums, David Schreiber on guitar and bass guitar, Martin Nienstedt on bass guitar, Dan Madinabeitia on piano, and Rachel Fishman and Regan Solmo on vocals.

Brown grew up in New Lynn, New Zealand and is of MƒÅori, PƒÅkehƒÅ and English descent. She attended the University of Auckland for both her undergraduate and graduate degrees. In 1997, she completed her PhD at the University of Auckland in New Zealand. Her thesis was titled M≈çrehu Architecture which focused on MƒÅori architecture between the years 1850 and 1950. After completing her education, Brown began to focus on teaching her specialty of MƒÅori art history and architecture at universities. Deidre Brown is currently teaching at the University of Auckland and is also the head of the School of Architecture and Planning. Additionally, she is a governor of the Arts Foundation of New Zealand, a member of the MƒÅori Trademarks Advisory Committee of the Intellectual Property Office of New Zealand, and a member of the Humanities Panel of the Marsden Fund.  Career  Following her PhD in 1998, Brown began her academic career at the University of Canterbury School of Fine Arts, where she was a lecturer in the Art History department teaching MƒÅori Art History. In 2003, Brown returned to the University of Auckland where she taught design and history in the School of Architecture and Planning. She is now a professor at the School of Architecture and Planning, with research interests in MƒÅori architecture and art, the relationship of art and curatorship to architecture, and intersections between culture and technology. She has published a number of books about art and architecture that focuses on her interests, specifically MƒÅori art. Brown has also curated a number of exhibitions in galleries throughout New Zealand. Over the years, Brown has received a number of awards for her impactful work. Deidre has worked at the University of Auckland for over a decade and was recently named as the next head of the School of Architecture and Planning beginning in January 2019. She is the first indigenous female to head an architecture school.  MƒÅori: Academic Focus  Deidre Brown's main academic focus is the history of MƒÅori art and architecture. Her focus on this culture within her studies began because of her personal connection as a descendant of the MƒÅori people. Many of Brown's work discuss the culture of the MƒÅori tribes, honing in on the art and architecture. The MƒÅori are indigenous Polynesian people of New Zealand. They arrived in New Zealand between 1250 and 1300. The culture developed uniquely because of the people's isolation. They even developed their own language. Brown's work about MƒÅori art and architecture reveals historical information about the distinct culture. Through much of her research new findings have developed about the isolated, indigenous culture.  Books  Brown has contributed and edited a variety of books connected to her interests of study. She is the co-author of A New Zealand Book of Beasts: Animals in our History, Culture and Everyday Life with Annie Potts and Philip Armstrong in which her chapters examine the significance of animals in MƒÅori and PƒÅkehƒÅ art. Brown also wrote a book titled MƒÅori Architecture that explores the different MƒÅori- designed structures and space and their evolution over time. Deidre Brown continues to share her studies and interests of art and architecture with the world through research and literature. Books Deidre Brown wrote or edited: *Brown, D. S., A. Potts and P.

Production and thematic notes Shootout at the Sugar Factory was Tris McCall's follow-up album to If One of These Bottles Should Happen to Fall (1999), which had established the prominence of New Jersey life and politics in McCall's songwriting. The album was co-produced by Jay Braun of the Negatones, of whom McCall stated, \\"I don't think he was interested in telling a coherent story about my experiences in Hudson County. He was looking for certain musical virtues, a certain rock ferocity.\\" In contrast with the desired impression of ferocity, Brooklyn music journalist Michele De Meglio categorized Shootout as \\"an ode to bubblegum pop infused with the musician's synthpunk\\" in \\"a record completely focused on the art and architecture of New York and New Jersey.\\" McCall told De Meglio, \\"All these songs are about how much I love built environments. It's love songs sung to the city, roads, highways, and the plastic face of public culture.\\" In 2004, McCall told Chorus & Verse that the \\"most polemical\\" songs were the last ones added, adding that without the \\"full force\\" of argumentative lyrics on urban decay, he would have run an unacceptable \\"risk of being inscrutable to the casual listener.\\" Making explicit the connections among the songs in Shootout, McCall called it \\"an album about public culture and the fragility of urban spaces.\\"  Songs  Shootout opened with the \\"apocalyptic farewell\\" of an overqualified toll collector in \\"Scatter My Ashes on the New Jersey Turnpike\\".

Plot  The film begins with a flashback to a household in Las Moscas, New Mexico, in the year 1959. The mother, Mrs. Pearly, is completely overwhelmed managing her household chores, her children Enid and June, and their visiting friend Harry. Angry and vicious, Enid puts her baby sister June into the oven while her mother is off for a moment to receive Harry's mother. 25 years later, Enid, now joined with Harry in an unloving marriage, returns home to unexpectedly find him having an affair with June. Reacting violently, she prepares to shoot them with Harry's police service gun; June smashes a vase on her head, apparently killing her. Panicking, they decide to make Enid's death look like a car accident while she and June went visiting their mother; but complications arise when Harry's partner Floyd unwittingly gets in their way and a guiltridden June begins holding a monologue with Enid to rid herself of her pangs of conscience, delaying her in getting rid of the body. While transporting Enid's body to a dangerous road curve in the desert for the staging, June discovers that an actual accident has occurred there. Moreover, a drunken trucker attempts to hit on both her and Enid, forcing her to shake him off and thus putting Harry and Floyd on her case. After unsuccessfully trying to push the car off a cliff, she attempts to simply dump Enid in the middle of the desert, but gets herself stuck near an Indian burial ground. Leaving the body, she calls Harry from a gas station for help; en route, Harry abandons Floyd at a rest stop, but right afterwards Floyd gets involved in an attempted armed robbery and shoots one of the robbers, sending his partner fleeing. After retrieving the body with Harry's help, June takes a stop at a road motel, but gets an unbidden visitation from the drunk trucker, causing the motel's manager to throw them out. Forced to a stop by a fallen tree, she pushes the car into the nearby Sanchez River, but a young couple sees her and calls in the police. Harry dumps Floyd once again and aids June into pulling the car out of the river. While driving home, June falls asleep at the wheel and wrecks a billboard, causing a state trooper to pull her over; but when he opens the trunk, he is knocked out by Enid, who is, though groggy, in fact very much alive. June deposites Enid at her home, but while driving away, she is kidnapped by the fugitive robber. Suffering a nervous breakdown, she begins to drive wildly, causing the robber to drop a lit cigarette into a puddle of leaking gasoline, which blows up the car, killing the robber. With the body burned beyond recognition, and with Enid's cigarette case found in the wreck, everyone in town, including Harry, assumes that Enid was the victim. Elated, Harry returns home, only to find a slightly scorched June and the still-living - and extremely furious - Enid waiting for him.

It was released in December 2009 on the Melody Lanes label.  Songs and thematic notes  The album opens with \\"WFMU\\", a paean to college and independent radio that \\"builds from catchy trip-hop to a blazing chorus metaphorically loaded with unease, one rapidfire mot juste or double entendre after another.\\" The book Music: What Happened? cites the song \\"Battleships\\" as both political and romantic. \\"You're Dead After School,\\" according to McCall, was his only autobiographical song; as a student, McCall lost a role model, a teacher who was arrested for molesting a retarded child. At AllMusic, critic Paula Carino called the song both \\"sad and hilarious.\\" \\"Sugar Nobody Wants,\\" in which the protagonist suggests breaking into an office supply store for the night, \\"endorses petty thievery and vandalism at a variety of unloved Jersey locations as a sort of what-the-hell morale booster for all concerned,\\" in what the lyrics called \\"candy-assed forms of civil disobedience.\\" McCall stated that the song was about \\"finding the cracks in the city that aren't mapped, or that used to be mapped and have fallen away as the legend has been rewritten, and making your stand there.... in the invisible spaces where the authorities don‚Äôt bother to look.\\" A music video for \\"Sugar Nobody Wants,\\" created by McCall and producer Jay Braun, was released in April 2010.  Critical reception  Music journalist Paula Carino described McCall as a \\"first-rate wordsmith\\" writing with a \\"nuanced, exasperated love for his home state\\", who \\"packs a novella's worth of keenly observed details into every song.\\" Carino identified a consistent trend going back to McCall's \\"brilliant 1999 debut... highly melodic, piano-driven songs with intricate (but rocking) arrangements and insightful lyrics.\\" Lucid Culture called McCall an \\"unsurpassed\\" lyricist, likening him to Elvis Costello and Aimee Mann, and praising his differentiated use of sarcasm and irony in songs with a \\"defiant populism... often surprisingly cheery considering the underlying grimness.\\" The San Diego Reader further described Let the Night Fall as \\"rich,\\" and McCall as \\"mighty,\\" stating \\"You don't have to be from Jersey.

It appeared that the women disturbed the intruder and the intruder attacked and killed them. The women's bodies were found in their respective bedrooms the following morning by a relative. There was evidence that the killer had arrived and departed on bicycle.How a forensics breakthrough nailed George Green, the chimney sweep killer Amongst the evidence found was part of a note that was found under Annie Wiseman's body. The note also had traces of chimney dust. Police went to the address on the docket which was in Coburg and the homeowner told detectives she'd written on the ticket the name and address of another woman who needed the services of a chimneysweep. She told police she'd given the docket to George Green. Police immediately tracked down Green, who denied any knowledge of the murders. Green's alibi was that he had spent the night drinking in a hotel in Heidelberg and then sleeping rough on a vacant block nearby. He claimed to have given the docket to two other sweeps even though he was low on funds himself. Trial and sentencing The trial was held in the Melbourne Supreme Court.

The new building bore the B√≠l√° labu≈• name and was designed by renowned architects Josef Kittrich and Josef Hrub√Ω. The department store has a total area of about 72,000 m¬≥ spread over 11 floors, including 6 retail floors. It is recognized as one of Prague's most architecturally important buildings and a celebrated example of the \\"International Style\\" of functionalism. At the time of its opening, it was the largest and most modern commercial building in Central and Eastern Europe and remains well known throughout the Czech Republic as a retail icon. Interesting features of the building included modern interior design, the first escalator in Prague, and a glass facade measuring 33 x 18 meters, consisting of 180 sheets of non-transparent, silver-gray glass with thermal- and noise- insulating properties. At the time, it was the largest glass-covered space in central Europe. There is also an eight-meter revolving neon swan on the roof ‚Äì the oldest neon sign in Prague. The building was opened on 19 March 1939 against the tragic background of the Nazi occupation of the Czech Republic, which had occurred four days previously, and the store has been continuously operating since then. Today  In November 2017, a renovation that fully respects the original, historically protected, construction began. This includes a complete restoration of the glass facade, which had deteriorated significantly over the years. The store remains a key retail destination in Prague, with high footfall and excellent demographics in the surrounding area. Tenants include Lidl, Kika, and a large number of other medium to smaller retail spaces.

Biography Mario Antonio Read Vittini was born in Hatillo, near San Crist√≥bal, on 15 May 1926. From his father, he descends from William Augustus Read (1820‚Äì1887), an American immigrant from Roxbury, Massachusetts of English and French descent, who married Dominga Rodr√≠guez Isambert, a Dominican of partial French origin. His mother has Corsican ancestry. Read Vittini became a Doctor of Law in 1948. On 10 June 1952 he became First Secretary for Embassies and Legations. In 1960 he sought political asylum in the Brazilian embassy and received asylum from the United States and exiled in New York, where he married Carmen Virginia Escobar. He returned to the Dominican Republic after the death of dictator Rafael Trujillo and became the Vice Presidential Candidate of the Democratic Revolutionary Nationalistic Party (Partido Nacionalista Revolucionario Democr√°tico) in the 1962 Dominican Republic general election, despite he co-founded in that year the Social Christian Reformist Party (PRSC). He favoured the coup against Juan Bosch in September 1963. During the Triumvirate, Read Vittini served as Secretary (Minister) of the Presidency. By 1966 the PRSC had split into three factions and Read Vittini was the leader of one of them: the right-wing party Christian Democratic Party (PDC), which supported Joaqu√≠n Balaguer in the 1966 election, but Read declared himself in opposition to Balaguer early in 1968. Read served as Ambassador from the Dominican Republic to the United States from 1969 to 1970. He later served as Legal consultant of the Executive Branch from 1986 until 1988, when he was designated Secretary (Minister) of Labour. He also served as the Dominican representative at the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB), and as Governor of the Central Bank of the Dominican Republic from 18 August 1993 to 31 August 1994 with Eligio Bison√≥ Bison√≥ as his deputy governor. Read died from pancreatic cancer on 20 July 2010, aged 84, at his home in Evaristo Morales, Ensanche Quisqueya, in the city of Santo Domingo.

The participants included eight national-level institutions for archaeology and cultural relics, provincial-level archaeological institutes from 28 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions, as well as from Hong Kong, the archaeological departments of 11 major national universities, and many other scholars in Beijing. After three months and three rounds of voting, the results were announced on 29 March 2001 and were published in the journal Kaogu (Archaeology). In 2002, the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences Press published the book China's 100 Major Archaeological Discoveries in the 20th Century (‰∫åÂçÅ‰∏ñÁ∫™‰∏≠ÂõΩÁôæÈ°πËÄÉÂè§Â§ßÂèëÁé∞), with more than 500 pages and 1,512 pictures. Among all the candidates, the late-Shang dynasty capital Yinxu received the highest number of votes. Other sites that received high votes include Zhoukoudian, Banpo, Erlitou, Sanxingdui, Mausoleum of the First Qin Emperor and the Terracotta Army, Han dynasty Chang'an, Juyan Han ruins, the Yungang Grottoes, the Longmen Grottoes, the Dunhuang Grottoes, Luoyang of Sui‚ÄìTang dynasties, and the Dingling mausoleum. Of the 100 discoveries selected, 51% were made by scientific initiative, whereas 31% were made accidentally and 10% were rescue archaeology. More than half of the academic discoveries were made in the Yellow River region, reflecting the traditional view, held by most archaeologists until the 1980s, that the Chinese civilization originated there. By contrast, other regions such as the Yangtze River valley accounted for two thirds of the accidental discoveries, typically found during construction. List by chronology The 100 major archaeological discoveries selected include 7 discoveries from the Palaeolithic Age, 30 from the Neolithic Age, 23 from the Xia‚ÄìShang‚ÄìZhou era, 24 from the Qin and Han to the Northern and Southern dynasties, and 16 from the Sui‚ÄìTang and later dynasties.

Both villages and subdistricts are part of the Government of Brunei, and they are administered as part of the Subdistricts and Villages Institution () under the District Offices of the respective districts that they belong. A village is headed by a village head (', also ), who may be appointed by the government or elected by the village population. Always a male, he shall then be in office for up to ten years. A village may also have a Village Consultative Council (), the local equivalent of community association. A key outcome of the Council is One Village One Product (, abbreviated as '), which promotes local goods produced in the village.  Characteristics  A typical Bruneian village may have basic socio-economic infrastructures which are similar to other villages elsewhere but may also be unique to Brunei or countries which have predominantly Islamic Malay culture. For communal purposes, there may be a or , the local equivalent of a community centre. A Bruneian village typically has a primary school. Because the majority of Brunei's population is Muslims, many villages have mosques, particularly serving the need of Jumu'ah or congregational Friday prayers, as well as a religious primary school for its resident Muslim pupils. There are also at least a grocery store present in many villages, as well as a few other miscellaneous shops such as eateries, tailors, and barbers or salons.  Variation  A village may have population ranging from hundreds to less than ten thousand people. Also, not all of the socio-economic amenities are present in every village. Some villages do not have primary and/or religious primary school ‚Äì prospective resident pupils go to the schools in nearby villages. Some village subdivisions are simply designated public housing areas but having the population size comparable to a village. Other villages, especially in the more urban areas, may be large enough to function socio-economically as towns but without any municipal body. Several villages may also be part of municipal areas of Bandar Seri Begawan and other district towns, thus the populaces may also be subjected under the jurisdiction of respective municipal departments.  Kampong Ayer  Even though Kampong Ayer has the term ' in its name, it is not officially a village subdivision. In fact, Kampong Ayer is made up of several villages constituting a few subdistricts.

The house dates from the 1700s and has been derelict for some years. In 2009 it was offered for sale for ¬£5m along with 140 acres of farm and parkland. In 2014 it was considered a complete ruin with a reduced demesne of 80 acres. It is a listed building of County Down since 1980. History Described by The News Letter as a well built elegant brick house with four or five rooms per floor, where the central portion of the building features a Diocletian window on top floor and a Palladian one below it. It was built about 1740 on almost 150 acres. The most famous resident was the writer Mary Delany, who married Patrick Delany in 1743, and divided her time between Mount Panther and Dublin from 1744 until 1760. They rented the house and during their first year in the house Patrick was made Dean of Down. The building was expanded with the addition of three bay wings and some rooms, such as the renowned ballroom, whose plasterwork done by Dublin stucco artists. This work was instigated by the 1st Earl Annesley who bought the property in 1772. The stable courtyard at the rear, dating from the late 18th century, was rather plain and contrasted with the elegant front to which had been added floating labels above the ground and first floor windows and the cornice featured Italianate bracket mouldings.US forces Nissen huts on Mount Panther property After the earl's death in 1802 the property passed through the ownership of Charles William Moore, Rector of Moira, and in 1822 was sold to William Henry Rainey to be sold just ten years later to a John Reed Allen, then Thomas Gracey and in 1931 to a Paddy Fitzpatrick. During World War II United States Army units had Nissen hut cantonments at Mount Panther. The following were stationed here: 2nd Battalion 1st Armour of the 1st Armoured Division, 13th Infantry of 8th Infantry Division, and 21st Field Artillery Battalion of 5th Division. Princess Margaret and Lord Snowdon were impressed by the rococo plasterwork of the ballroom during their 1963 visit while Joan Collins and Jonathan Swift were also said to be admirers. Decline Mount Panther for sale The house fell into disrepair from the 1960s with the roof being stripped and the interior plasterwork mainly removed, so is now an empty shell. In July 1980 it was added to the B+ listed buildings of Northern Ireland. While up for sale in 2008, representatives of Donald Trump visited the property and showed interest in the house and its then 170-acre estate as a potential golf venue.

Papalii has played three tests for the All Blacks, New Zealand's international team, since his debut in 2018. His position of choice is flanker. Papalii has previously represented New Zealand at Under-20 level.  Early life and education  He played rugby league, his family's sport, in his early years but switched to rugby union as a youngster, when he had the chance to go to Saint Kentigern College. He went on to captain his school's First XV, and won the 2015 Grant Dalton Cup after captaining them to the title by beating Auckland Grammar in the final. In 2015 led the New Zealand Schools side to victory over Australia. Domestic Career After school, Papalii joined the Auckland development programme and also represented his local club Pakuranga. He played for the Blues under-18 squad before going on to captain the Blues under-20s in 2016 and the Blues A team in 2017. He won the Blues Development Player of the Year twice, in 2016 and 2017, the same year in which he made his senior Auckland debut. In 2018 he made his Super Rugby debut against the Chiefs as a second half replacement. With Blake Gibson out for much of the season, he was given his chance with seven appearances, five of them as a starter, until he also was sidelined later in the season with injury. Dalton carried his rich vein of form into Auckland‚Äôs Mitre 10 Cup campaign, leading the competition tackle statistics with 169 and battering defences with his hard running. In 2020, Papalii decided to change provinces, leaving Auckland and signing with Counties Manukau. Tai Lavea, the Steeler's coach, had coached Papalii at Saint Kentigern College and convinced him to make the switch. That same year he established himself as a key component of the Blues back row trio during the Super Rugby Aotearoa competition  International career  Dalton was part of the New Zealand U20 squad that won the 2017 Junior World Championship hosted by Georgia. He earned praise for his performances and was lauded by coach Craig Philpott for his leadership skills. After a stellar season in Auckland‚Äôs Mitre 10 Cup 2018 campaign, he was somewhat surprisingly called into the 32 an All Blacks squad for their northern tour to Japan and Europe, just weeks after his 21st birthday. The call came after injury to 60-test veteran and former All Black Captain, Sam Cane. Getting the call meant a lot for the Papalii family, as his mum broke down in tears upon hearing his name on the list. Papalii made his international debut for New Zealand on 3 November 2018, starting in the All Blacks' 69-31 victory over Japan at the Ajinomoto Stadium. In doing so, he became the first Pakuranga player to represent the All Blacks. His performance against Japan enabled him to earn a spot on the bench for the final test of 2018, against Italy, where he replaced the in-form Ardie Savea 48 minutes into the 66-3 victory over Italy. With an All Blacks tour under his belt, 2019 saw Dalton become a regular feature in the Blues back row earning 21 caps in total. Another All Blacks call up beckoned during the Rugby Championship, playing against the Springboks in Wellington. After the Blues' disappointing 2019 Super Rugby season, Papalii was retained in the All Blacks' squad for the 2019 Rugby Championship, having put in excellent performances across the season. With All Black Vice-Captain, Sam Cane, back from a broken neck, Papalii only made one appearance in the competition, replacing Highlanders blindside flanker, Shannon Frizell, for the final four minutes of a test against South Africa, which ended in a 16-16 draw.  Style of play  Papalii can cover both flanker positions, being deployed at blindside or openside, despite being considered by some to be too big to play openside. About his preferred position, he says \\"Six or seven, I'm not too sure. If I get on that field, I'm going to try and do my best for the team. I prefer to play six, but six, seven or eight I don't mind, I just want to do my bit for the team.\\" He cites Wallabies captain Michael Hooper as his favourite rugby player, thanks to his \\"relentless effort off the ball...a deadly player on attack and defence with the desire to win in every aspect of play in rugby and off\\". Papalii is renowned for his tackling skills, regularly averaging around 20 tackles a game on his Auckland days. He also stands out for his strong running, great ball skills and overall work-rate around the park. Papalii credits Auckland forwards coach and former All Black Filo Tiatia for his constant progress: ‚ÄúI felt like I‚Äôve learnt a lot off Filo, the forwards coach,‚Äù Papali‚Äôi said. ‚ÄúBut around my game, I knew the qualities of a seven, tackling and stuff, but they [the coaching staff] were showing me different ways of how to get to rucks and stuff like that.‚Äù  Notes   References  Category:New Zealand rugby union players Category:1997 births Category:Living people Category:Auckland rugby union players Category:Blues (Super Rugby) players Category:New Zealand international rugby union players Category:Rugby union players from Auckland Category:People educated at Saint Kentigern College Category:Rugby union flankers ","title":"Dalton Papalii"},{"id":"56021040","text":"Maksim Myakish (; ; born 3 March 2000) is a Belarusian professional footballer.

Because there is no way to directly observe or measure deep earth processes, geochemists rely on experimental petrology to establish quantitative values and relationships in order to construct models of the deep earth. Experimental petrology can range from creating artificial magmas to measure crystallization behavior to observing recrystallization of minerals at varying pressure/temperature conditions. Methodology Although methodology varies from experiment to experiment, in general the procedure involves evaluating a synthetic rock or magma (created from a blend of oxides to replicate the chemistry of the rock/system in question) in an apparatus capable of creating and sustaining high pressures and temperatures such as a diamond anvil cell. In general, it is ideal if the enclosing capsule is relatively nonreactive, such as diamond or platinum/gold alloys. Experimental igneous petrology Experimental igneous petrology is the subset of experimental petrology concerned with quantifying the behavior of magmas and their associated igneous rocks at depth. Standard procedure generally involves the creation of a synthetic magma (often corresponding to a real world analog) which is then cooled to a target temperature. After crystallization, the products are analyzed - qualities of interest include mineral assemblage (which minerals crystallized and how much), mineral chemistry, and liquid (the remainder of the synthetic magma base) composition. Equilibrium crystallization  Equilibrium crystallization studies are those in which a starting liquid is cooled until fully crystalline. This is taken to be the \\"equilibrium state\\" of the composition under those particular P/T conditions. Criticisms of equilibrium crystallization include the observation that real-world systems are believed to rarely sit still during crystallization and thus would not be able to properly equilibrate.  Fractional crystallization  Fractional crystallization studies represent a fairly recent trend in experimental petrology, gaining popularity as a way to more accurately depict magma evolution in scenarios where a cumulate layer is built. In them, a starting liquid is cooled in small temperature steps (e.g. 30 ¬∞C). At each temperature step the contents are removed and analyzed as in equilibrium crystallization. Afterwards, a new liquid corresponding to the residual liquid from the previous step is synthesized, heated, and then subjected to another cooling step. The purpose of this stepwise approach is to examine how each new interval of crystallization affects the chemistry of the parent magma and, thus, the behavior of future crystallization steps. In such a manner it is possible to examine the behavior of a magma body as it slowly cools and crystallizes over time.

It is located in Okinawa Prefecture and encompasses the city of Naha and parts of Shimajiri District (Kumejima, Tokashiki, Zamami, Aguni, Tonaki, Minamidait≈ç, Kitadait≈ç). As of 2016, 270,872 eligible voters were registered in the district.Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications (MIC): The district has been represented by Seiken Akamine of the Japanese Communist Party (JCP) since the 2014 general election, when he defeated the incumbent member K≈çnosuke Kokuba from the Liberal Democratic Party. Akamine is the only JCP politician in the country to currently hold a single-seat constituency.  Background  The 1994 electoral reforms split Okinawa's at-large constituency into four single-district constituencies. In the first three elections after the reforms, Okinawa's 1st district was won by Tai'ichi Shiraho of New Frontier Party and later New K≈çmeit≈ç (NKP). The district also features several significant voting blocs. The reliable and sizable Soka Gakkai voting bloc in Naha helped to deliver the district to Shiraho in those elections. The Japanese Communist Party (JCP) has also maintained a relatively large share of vote in the district, banking on the urban voter support and local opposition to the US military bases in Okinawa. Another bloc consists of corporate workers that tend to support the LDP. In the 2014 general election, the district was won by JCP's Seiken Akamine. Akamine's election was a watershed as it marked the first time a JCP candidate managed to win a single-seat constituency since the 1996 general election. This is also only the third constituency JCP has won since the introduction of parallel voting. The anti-base camp aligned to Okinawa Governor Takeshi Onaga created an alliance behind Akamine to oppose the LDP incumbent at that time, K≈çnosuke Kokuba. Kokuba supports the relocation of the US air base in Futenma to Henoko, following the policy of the LDP and Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. The centre-right vote was split further with the candidacy of former representative Mikio Shimoji. A strong anti-base vote and the split in the centre-right camp delivered the district to Akamine, completing JCP's surge in the election. Akamine retained the district in the 2017 general election despite the JCP losing seats across the country. Akamine managed to keep the anti-base camp solidly behind him, giving him a slightly larger majority than 2014.  List of representatives  { class=\\" mw-collapsible\\" - valign=bottom !

It was Afghanistan's first Test since they were awarded Test status by the International Cricket Council (ICC) in June 2017. India won the match in two days by an innings and 262 runs. Afghanistan were dismissed twice in the same day, only the fourth time this has happened in Tests. It was India's biggest win by an innings in Tests, and they became the first Asian team to win a Test match inside two days. After the match, India's captain Ajinkya Rahane said that it is just the beginning for Afghanistan, and playing more Tests and first-class cricket would improve the side. Phil Simmons, Afghanistan's coach, said that the team were \\"by no means happy' with their performance\\", but believes they will get there with further hard work. Background In late 2017, it was announced that Zimbabwe would be Afghanistan's first Test opponents, but the tour was confirmed as being limited overs matches only. In December 2017, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) and the Afghanistan Cricket Board (ACB) confirmed that the match would take place in 2018, with the exact date and venue to be announced at a later date. In January 2018, both the ACB and the BCCI confirmed the Test would be played in June at the M. Chinnaswamy Stadium in Bengaluru. It was the first time a Test match was played in June in India.

This was in preparation for India's tour to England the following month. However, a neck injury ruled him out of playing for Surrey in England. Ajinkya Rahane was named as India's captain for the Test match in Kohli's absence. Prior to the final squad selection, Afghanistan had a team of thirty players warming up for the match in Greater Noida. On 29 May 2018, the ACB announced a sixteen-man squad for the Test match, with Asghar Stanikzai named as the captain. Afghan bowler Rashid Khan said that \\"it will be a big day for cricket in Afghanistan\\" and he could not wait to become a Test cricketer. He later added that the match will be \\"a test of patience\\" and that he might end up taking no wickets. Ahead of the Test, Wriddhiman Saha was ruled out of India's squad due to injury, and was replaced by Dinesh Karthik. Mohammed Shami was also ruled out of India's squad after failing a fitness test, being replaced by Navdeep Saini. Before the Test, both captains commented on the significance of the fixture. Asghar Stanikzai, Afghanistan's captain, said that \\"to be playing our first Test against India is a great honour and we hope to give a good account of ourselves\\". India's captain, Ajinkya Rahane, said \\"it's a privilege to be playing in Afghanistan's first Test match\\" adding that it will be an historic moment for the Afghan team.

It is situated in Gotse Delchev Municipality, Blagoevgrad Province. It was declared on 22 February 1985 to protect old growth beech forests it the vicinities of Mount Orelyak (2,099 m), the highest summit in Central Pirin. It spans a territory of 757 ha or 7.57 km2.  Geographic overview  The border of the reserve follows the main mountain ridge to the north of Mount Orelayk; the ridge itself is within the reserve's buffer zone. The easternmost section is situated in the valley of the Lazhnichka river, a tributary to the Marevo river. Orelyak reserve is situated at an altitude between 900 m and 1800 m. The rock base is formed of marbles. The climate is continental Mediterranean and Alpine at higher altitude.  Flora  The forests of European beech (Fagus sylvatica) are of greatest conservation importance. Their average age is over 150 years and despite being old growth, the forests have remained extremely dense. In the lower parts of the reserve the beech forests have been replaced by the other deciduous trees like European hop-hornbeam (Ostrya carpinifolia) and South European flowering ash (Fraxinus ornus). In the western sections at about 1700 m altitude there are also small patches of Macedonian pine (Pinus peuce). Orelyak reserve is home to a number Bulgarian and Balkan endemic herbaceous species, including Pirin tea (Sideritis scardica), Draba scardica, Achillea chrysocoma, Saxifraga ferdinandi-coburgi, Viola grisebachiana, Polygala rhodopaea, Arabis ferdinandi-coburgii, Thymus perinicus, etc.  Fauna  Despite the small territory of the reserve, the fauna is diverse. Typical animals include brown bear, gray wolf, red fox, wild boar, roe deer, Greek stream frog, fire salamander, etc.  References   External links  * * Category:Nature reserves in Bulgaria Category:Pirin Category:Geography of Blagoevgrad Province Category:Tourist attractions in Blagoevgrad Province Category:Protected areas established in 1985 Category:1985 establishments in Bulgaria ","title":"Orelyak Reserve"},{"id":"56021578","text":"Mona Ghanem Al Marri (Arabic: ŸÖŸÜŸâ ÿ∫ÿßŸÜŸÖ ÿßŸÑŸÖÿ±Ÿä) is a government media official in the United Arab Emirates.

Media career  Currently, Mona Al Marri is the Director General of the Government of Dubai Media Office. Throughout her career, she has completed many projects and initiatives. In 1999, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum assigned Mona Al Marri to establish the Dubai Press Club. The Club contributes to positioning Dubai as a media and journalism hub and it's a platform for journalists and media professionals to discuss and deliberate political, economic and social issues. The Club also works to develop and support journalism on the local and regional levels through initiatives like the Arab Media Forum, the Arab Journalism Award, the Emirati Media Forum and the annual Arab Media Outlook report.  Arab Media Forum  While leading the Dubai Press Club, Mona Al Marri launched the Arab Media Forum (AMF), which was inaugurated in 2001. The event evolved into a prominent media platform attracting over 2000 participants every year. The forum brings together political leaders, academia and intellectuals to participate and lead discussions. As head of AMF's Organizing Committee, Mona Al Marri engages with key media figures, editors in chief, well known columnists and journalists from the region and internationally. = Arab Journalism Award = As President of the Dubai Press Club, Mona Al Marri launched the Arab Journalism Award in 1999 to celebrate achievements and excellence in journalism and honor distinguished journalists. The award is given each year by Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum during the Arab Media Forum. It plays a role in motivating Arab media and encouraged Arab journalists to adopt innovation and creativity to develop their work. = Emirati Media Forum = In 2013, Mona Al Marri launched the Emirati Media Forum to focus on local media in the United Arab Emirates and serve as a platform for dialogue, similar to the Arab Media Forum. By focusing on local media, the forum provides a space to discover young talents and help them start careers in the media industry. = Arab Social Media Influencers Summit = First cycle of Arab Social Media Influencers Summit was held in March 2015. The event was designed to shed light on experiences and stories of Arab and international social media influencers through a variety of workshops and panels that focused on positive communication and how to best utilize social media platforms as vehicle to overcome social challenges. The forum also discussed the relationship between traditional and social media and their role in shaping the future of the region. In 2016, the Dubai Press Club was assigned to manage and organize the event.  Government of Dubai Media Office  In 2012, she was appointed as Director General of the Government of Dubai Media Office, a government entity responsible for managing the media affairs of His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum the Ruler of Dubai, His Highness Hamdan bin Mohammed Al Maktoum the Crown Prince of Dubai and His Highness Maktoum bin Mohammed Al Maktoum the Deputy Ruler of Dubai; furthermore, the Office manages relationships and coordination between the Government of Dubai and local and international media.  Women Empowerment  Mona Al Marri is influential in the UAE as a female leader with contributions in the fields of women empowerment and gender equality which are recognized on the local and regional levels. Through her positions, she has helped transform the role of Women in the United Arab Emirates by applying the leadership's vision into reality through many initiatives and projects that aim to improve Emirati women's engagements in the community and various economic activities.  Dubai Ladies Club  Following directives from Her Highness Sheikha Manal bint Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Mona Al Marri established the Dubai Ladies Club in 2003. The club offers fitness facilities, services, events and activities dedicated to nurturing the social, physical and cultural well-being of women. The club is for women only, and provides a private, safe and secure environment for women to engage in social activities. The club also works to inspire and empower women with new skills, and to promote a healthy lifestyle.  Dubai Women Establishment  After her success in establishing the Dubai Ladies Club, and under supervision of Her Highness Sheikha Manal bint Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Mona took the responsibility for establishing and developing the Dubai Women Establishment. Currently, Al Marri is the Managing Director and Chairman of Board of Directors of Dubai Women Establishment. Soon, the establishment became of the most active organizations in the field of women empowerment in the region. In 2006, DWE kicked off its activities targeting a number of strategic objectives. These objectives include developing the skills and capabilities of Emirati women and encouraging her to positively engage in professional and social activities. In this regard, the establishment launched many programs and initiatives and drafted recommendations that will help the government legislating policies that expand the domain of women engagement in Dubai's communities.  UAE Gender Balance Council  In recognition of her contributions in the field of women empowerment and support, Mona Al Marri was appointed as Vice President of the UAE Gender Balance Council in 2015. The UAE Gender Balance Council was established to reduce the gender gap across all government sectors in the country; enhance the UAE's ranking in global reports on gender equality; and promote gender balance in decision-making positions. The Council also aims to launch innovative initiatives and projects that contribute to greater gender balance, which will position the UAE as a model for gender balance and a benchmark for legislation. Global Women‚Äôs Forum Dubai  While presiding over the Dubai Women Establishment, Mona Al Marri accomplished many achievements. Perhaps the most significant is the Global Women Forum Dubai 2016, held for the first time in MENA in collaboration with the Women's Forum for the Economy and Society, Deauville-France. The historic gathering garnered local, regional and international attention. It presented many characteristics that make Dubai and the UAE one of the world's fastest developing regions in innovation, education and governance. The gathering served Dubai's vision to be the epicentre of international conferences and in alignment with the UAE's strategy in empowering societies through women. Global Women's Forum Dubai reflects the UAE leaderships‚Äô keenness to elevate the status of UAE women and will favourably represent the character of the UAE and its citizens at a global level.  Local and International Recognition  In 2015, Mona Al Marri was appointed as member of the UAE National Media Council. In the same year, she was named member of the Board of Trustees of Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum Global Initiatives, the region's biggest humanitarian and community development foundation that includes 28 subsidiary. The foundation comprises four sectors that are essential for improving human life: combating poverty and disease, spreading knowledge, empowering communities, and entrepreneurship and innovation for the future. In recognition for her achievements and dedication in community service, the World Economic Forum selected Mona Al Marri as a 2014 Young Global Leader (YGL), an honour bestowed by the prestigious international organisation to recognize the most distinguished young leaders from around the world. In 2002, Al Marri participated as a member of the jury committee in the 30th International Emmy Awards for Asia and Africa hosted in Dubai.

It is located at 1700 West Fort Street in Detroit, Michigan, and as of 2017 is being redeveloped into a mixed use space. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2017. History Edson, Moore & Company was founded in 1872 and quickly became one of the largest dry goods wholesale businesses in Michigan. The firm employed a number of travelling salesmen, and by the turn of the century it was one of the largest wholesale jobbers in the Midwest. The increase in sales necessitated new headquarters: the company's first location was at the southwest corner of Bates Street and East Jefferson Avenue, but in 1882 the company moved to the newly constructed Palms Building across the street. A disastrous fire in 1893 leveled the building, but the firm rebuilt at the same location. By the early 1910s, Edson, Moore and Company desperately needed more warehouse space, but there was no room remaining in the built-up downtown wholesale district. They turned to the western riverfront district, at that time being newly developed. The firm hired the development company owned by John F. and Horace E. Dodge to construct this warehouse building. In 1913, the Dodges hired Detroit-based Smith, Hinchman & Grylls to design the warehouse building, and contracted Bryant & Detwiler Company to construct it at a cost of $237,000. Over subsequent years, Edson, Moore & Company's business evolved, from clothing to textiles and carpeting. The firm moved out of the Fort Street building in 1958 into a larger facility on Weest Chicago Boulevard. The firm lasted until 1974. In 1959, Edson, Moore & Company sold the Fort Street warehouse. In the 1970s the building was owned by the Charles Sabadash Company, and was used to rent warehouse space for storage. In the 1990s, the building was used by the Olde Discount brokerage for storage, and in 2004, Display Group, a design, fixtures and trade show kiosk company, purchased the building and moved in. In 2016, the building was purchased by Bedrock Real Estate, the real estate development division of Quicken Loans. As of 2017, the property is being redeveloped into a mixed-use space. Description The Corktown Lofts is a four-story Neoclassical warehouse building constructed of reinforced concrete and faced with dark reddish brown brick. The building is trapezoidal, filling the lot and abutting the former railroad tracks, laid diagonally to Fort Street, to the west. Additional levels below grade are exposed along the railroad track. The main facade, facing Fort Street, contains nine vertical bays. The seven center bays contain window openings with four vertical panes and a horizontal transom above. The window bays on each end contain the same windows, but with cast stone quoined surrounds on the upper levels and an arched window at the very top. There is a central entrance, deeply recessed, on the ground floor. A stone string course separates the upper floors from the lower. On the west facade, the decorative cast stone quoined surround and string course wraps around to ornament the first bay. The remaining bays are simplified in form, separated by vertical piers.

It is led by Vinay Joshi, a former RSS worker. According to Joshi, the group consists of a 150 volunteers, and he takes all decisions about filing legal petitions on behalf of the group. Joshi denies the group's connection to the RSS. The LRO has filed several legal complaints against media organisations. In April 2017, the LRO threatened the India Today TV channel with a police complaint for inviting human rights activist Nandini Sundar to a debate about India's Maoist insurgency; Sunday had previously published a well-received book on the subject. The LRO described Sundar as a \\"naxal worker\\" (sic). In October 2017, LRO objected to the 9th Anuradha Gandhi Memorial Lecture, commemorating the wife of jailed Naxal leader Kobad Ghandy, describing it as an \\"anti-national event\\". The event concluded peacefully, amid raised concerns among the organisers and the police. Following the introduction of the Citizenship Amendment Bill 2016 in the Indian parliament, the LRO filed a complaint with the Home Ministry against four media organisations opposing the bill. The LRO claimed that the organisations were participating in illegal financial transactions and in other criminal activities, and stated that the Home Ministry had initiated an inquiry following its complaint. The Home Ministry stated that it had not begun an inquiry, and only passed the complaint to the government of Assam. The LRO has also filed several legal complaints against the Catholic Church. In August 2017 LRO sent a letter to Pope Francis through the Holy See ambassador in Delhi, demanding an immediate apology from the Pope for discrimination and persecution, which they allege the Church was committing in Northeast India against local tribes. In November 2017, before the Gujarat Assembly elections, LRO lodged a complaint against the Archbishop of Gandhinagar, Thomas Ignatius MacWan. MacWan had asked his congregation to pray fr When the Election Commission of India received the LRO complaint, it served a notice to the archbishop asking for clarification. MacWad had written to his constituents, asking them to pray for politicians who would \\"remain faithful to the Indian Constitution\\" and save the country from \\"nationalist forces. The group is particularly active in Northeastern India. In 2017, Joshi complained to the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights, alleging that two missionary schools were forcing their children to participate in protests against the funeral of the leader of an indigenous faith. A Christian group in Meghalaya stated that the LRO was harassing Christians by filing complaints and court suits against several Christian leaders.

The tour included England's first Test matches in Sri Lanka since 2012. In September 2018, Sri Lanka Cricket named Dinesh Chandimal as the captain of the ODI team, replacing Angelo Mathews. Days later, Mathews was dropped from Sri Lanka's ODI side due to fitness concerns. However, Mathews was named in Sri Lanka's Test squad, which was named at the same time as the ODI squad. England won the ODI series 3‚Äì1, after the first match finished in a no result. Despite all five ODIs being affected by rain, the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) defended the decision to play the series during Sri Lanka's monsoon season, saying that they had \\"very little wriggle room\\" with regards to the dates. England won the one-off T20I match by 30 runs. In October 2018, Sri Lankan bowler Rangana Herath announced that he would retire from international cricket following the first Test in Galle. In the first innings of the match, he became the third bowler to take 100 Test wickets at the same venue, when he dismissed the England captain Joe Root. After the match, Herath said that it was \\"the right time\\" to retire, finishing his career with 433 Test wickets, the most for a left-arm spin bowler. Sri Lanka's Test captain, Dinesh Chandimal, was ruled out of the rest of the series after suffering an injury in the first Test, with Suranga Lakmal named as his replacement as captain for the remaining two Tests. England won the first two Test matches, therefore giving them an unassailable lead, and their first series win in Sri Lanka since 2001. England went on to win the third Test by 42 runs, therefore winning the series 3‚Äì0. It was the first time that England had won every Test of a three-match series in Sri Lanka. It was also England's first clean sweep in an overseas series of three or more Tests since beating New Zealand in 1963. The Test series saw 100 wickets taken by spin bowling, a record for a three-match series.

Prior to the third ODI, Liam Dawson was ruled out of the series with a side strain, and replaced by Joe Denly. Jonny Bairstow suffered an injury in training ahead of the fourth ODI and was ruled out of the remaining limited-over matches. Chris Jordan was added to the England squad for the one-off T20I. Ben Foakes was added to England's Test squad as cover for Jonny Bairstow. Bairstow's injury also ruled him out of the first Test. Ahead of the second Test, Ollie Pope was released from England's squad, to allow him to play with the England Lions. Kusal Mendis was added to Sri Lanka's squad, replacing Kusal Perera who suffered an injury during the second ODI match. Kusal Perera was then ruled out of the one-off T20I, with Sadeera Samarawickrama added to Sri Lanka's squad for the match. Ahead of the Test series, Lahiru Kumara was removed from Sri Lanka's squad for disciplinary reasons, and was replaced by Dushmantha Chameera. Ahead of the second Test, Charith Asalanka was added to Sri Lanka's squad. For the third Test, Nishan Peiris replaced Akila Dananjaya in Sri Lanka's squad. Dananjaya was reported for a suspect bowling action during the first Test. Danushka Gunathilaka was added to Sri Lanka's squad for the third Test, with Asalanka being released.

The season started with India leading the Test cricket rankings, England leading the ODI rankings and Pakistan leading the Twenty20 rankings. In October 2018, the International Cricket Council (ICC) introduced separate rankings for women's ODIs and T20Is for the first time, with Australia women leading both tables. All men's Twenty20 matches played between member sides after 1 January 2019 were given full international status and classified as T20Is, as per a decision made by the ICC in April 2018 (the same had applied to women's Twenty20 matches since 1 July 2018). The first men's T20Is to be classified as such under these new rules took place at the 2019 ACC Western Region T20. Men's international cricket started off with the 2018 Asia Cup Qualifier, which saw Hong Kong qualify for the 2018 Asia Cup. The Asia Cup started nine days later and was won by India, who beat Bangladesh in the final. Other highlights included New Zealand beating Pakistan in an away Test series for the first time in 49 years, India winning a Test series against Australia in Australia for the first time ever, and Sri Lanka becoming the first side from Asia to win a Test series against South Africa in South Africa. The last Test match of Bangladesh's tour of New Zealand was cancelled due to the Christchurch mosque shootings. In March 2019, Afghanistan won their first Test match, beating Ireland by seven wickets in their one-off Test in India. On 20 October, the ICC announced a major revamp to the 2023 Cricket World Cup qualification process. Following the conclusion of the Division Three and Division Two tournaments, the World Cricket League (WCL) was scrapped and the new qualification pathway consisted of the following tournaments: CWC Super League (comprising the 12 Full Members and the Netherlands), CWC League 2 (comprising Scotland, Nepal, the United Arab Emirates, and the top four finishers the Division Two tournament), CWC Challenge League (the next best 12 nations based on final rankings in the WCL), CWC Play-Off, and the CWC Qualifier. The 2018 ICC World Cricket League Division Three tournament, which was held in Oman, saw Oman and the United States promoted to Division Two, while Singapore, Kenya, Denmark and Uganda were placed in the CWC Challenge League. The Division Two tournament, was held in Namibia in April. Oman, Namibia, the United States and Papua New Guinea all finished in the top four places, and gained ODI status in the process. The qualification process for the 2020 ICC T20 World Cup started during the season. The East Asia-Pacific (EAP) Group B Subregional Qualifier, held in the Philippines, saw the Philippines qualify for the EAP Regional Qualifier. The Asia Eastern Sub Region Qualifier, held in Malaysia, saw Nepal, Singapore, and Malaysia qualify for the Asia Region Qualifier. The Africa Southern Sub Region Qualifier, held in Botswana, saw Botswana and Namibia qualify for the Africa Region Qualifier. The Americas Northern Sub Region Qualifier, held in the United States, saw Canada and the United States qualify for the America Region Qualifier. Papua New Guinea won the Regional Final of the EAP Qualifier to become the first team to qualify for the 2019 ICC T20 World Cup Qualifier tournament. Women's international cricket started off with India's tour of Sri Lanka. The highlight of women's cricket for the 2018‚Äì19 season was the Women's World Twenty20, which was won by Australia. The 2019 ICC Women's Qualifier Asia saw Thailand qualify for both the 2019 ICC Women's World Twenty20 Qualifier and 2020 Women's Cricket World Cup Qualifier.

Sparre was born in Gothenburg and travelled widely through Europe, collecting mostly Flemish and Dutch cabinet paintings. His collection of over 100 paintings is unusual because it remained largely intact for over two centuries. He was the wealthy son of the Marshal of the Court and the director of the Swedish East India Company (SOIC), Count Rutger Axel Sparre and Sara Christina Sahlgren (1723‚Äì1766). Her uncle Niclas Sahlgren had been a founder of the SOIC. Gustaf Adolf Sparre studied as a teenager at Lund and Uppsala University and spent the years 1768‚Äì1771 making a Grand Tour abroad, visiting Britain, the Netherlands, France and Germany. It was during these early travels that he began buying art. On his return he started work in his mother's family business that had been built up by her mother Brigitta Sahlgren and moved into the Sahlgrenska house named after her in Gothenburg, situated next to the SOIC headquarters. It was here where he first installed his art collection in the Gustavian floor. One of the original cabinet paintings in its Gustavian Sparre frame, gifted to the city of Gothenburg in 1981 by the Wachtmeister family trust, was hung in the Blue room of the newly restored Gustavian floor.

He was married in 1777 to Elizabeth Sophia Amalia Beata Ramel (1753‚Äì1830), daughter of Baron Hans Ramel (1724‚Äì1799) and Amalia Beata Lewenhaupt (1726‚Äì1810). Their daughter Christina Sparre married Jacob de la Gardie. When Gustaf Adolf Sparre died, his collection was documented in the estate inventory and this 1794 inventory was inherited by his wife, and later his daughter Christina. When the remainder of the painting collection was finally sold in 2007, many of the frames that had been ordered by Sparre in 1775 for his initial gallery in Sahgrenska house were still intact, making the match to the original estate inventory considerably easier. These frames were probably all made by the same framemakers, and possibly included the sculptor G. J. Fast, who made the Gustavian floor‚Äôs mirror frames and panelling.January 2013 press release by the Nationalmuseum announcing the purchase of 3 paintings from the collection The frames tend to be of three basic types, which are assumed to be associated with the three rooms of the original Sahlgrenska gallery. Count Sparre continued to make trips to Europe after he created the gallery, and he purchased three of his cabinet paintings at the estate sale of Antoine Poullain in Paris in 1780: File:Horse Stable by Gerard ter Borch, Getty Center.JPGHorse Stable, by Gerard ter Borch (which he may have seen earlier when it was in the collection of Louis Fran√ßois, Prince of Conti File:Adriaen van Ostade - Old Man with a Wine Glass L07033-11-lr-1.jpgOld Man with a Wine Glass, by Adriaen van Ostade File:Jacob Jordaens - Silenus.jpgSilenus, by Jacob Jordaens (which he may have seen earlier when it was in the collection of Paul Randon de Boisset) When Count Sparre's only surviving grandchild died without issue, his grandson-in-law sold Kulla Gunnarstorp Castle with its contents (including the cabinet paintings) to Carl de Geer in 1837. His granddaughter Elisabeth Wachtmeister- von Platen in turn set up a Wachtmeister family trust to hold the paintings, and she had the art historian Georg G√∂the make an inventory in 1895. During the course of the 20th-century, her descendants slowly began to sell off various pieces, and in December 2007 Sotheby's sold a major group of them.

He is best known for founding the Ueda S≈çko-ry≈´, a warrior class school of Japanese tea ceremony from Hiroshima. Ueda S≈çko went by the name Satar≈ç (‰ΩêÂ§™ÈÉé) in his younger days and later Shigeyasu (ÈáçÂÆâ).https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/‰∏äÁî∞ÈáçÂÆâ He received his Zen practitioner's name of Chikuin (Á´πÈö†) by the 111th patriarch of Daitoku-ji, Shunoku S≈çen. Today his death plaque is enshrined at the Sangen-in sub-temple of Daitoku-ji, beside that of his long time teacher in the Way of Tea, Furuta Oribe. S≈çko was held in high esteem by Toyotomi Hideyoshi for military exploits and as a tea master. In the Battle of Sekigahara (1600), S≈çko sided with Toyotomi's Western Army and was thus defeated. During the Siege of Osaka Summer Campaign (1615), S≈çko fought with Asano Yoshinaga on the Tokugawa side, and for this S≈çko was given a pardon by Tokugawa Ieyasu. In 1619, the Tokogawa shogunate assigned the Geish≈´ Domain to Asano Nagaakira and S≈çko relocated to Hiroshima serving Nagaakira. S≈çko was given a fief of 17,000 koku of rice in west Hiroshima (present day Hatsukaichi and ≈åtake) and the role of Chief Retainer of the Geish≈´ Domain for the Asano. In 1632 (Year nine of Kan'ei Era) at the age of 70, S≈çko retired from military duties and devoted himself to the Way of Tea. He immersed himself in a life of chanoyu: crafting tea equipage such as bamboo flower vases, chashaku tea scoops and firing raku ware tea bowls. S≈çko developed his own school of chanoyu known as the Ueda S≈çko-ry≈´. The school of Japanese tea ceremony continues in its 16th generation today, with an unbroken bloodline to Ueda S≈çko.  Ueda S≈çko the Warrior and Daimyo  In 1585 (Year 13 of Tensh≈ç), S≈çko was recruited as a samurai under Toyotomi Hideyoshi and awarded land equivalent of 10,000 koku of rice in Echizen. This gave S≈çko daimy≈ç status. Under Hideyoshi, S≈çko was assigned the role of supervisor for the construction of the temple for the great Buddha statue at H≈çk≈ç-ji temple in Kyoto. S≈çko was distinguished as a warrior for his exploits in the Ky≈´sh≈´ Campaign, Siege of Odawara, and Hideyoshi's Korean Campaigns. After many years of military success, in 1594 (Year three of Bunroku Era) Hideyoshi awarded his niece to S≈çko in marriage. S≈çko sided with Hideyoshi's Western Army in the Battle of Sekigahara. After the Western Army's defeat, S≈çko was welcomed by Hachisuka Iemasa the daimyo of Awa Province. As tea master to Iemasa, S≈çko instructed chanoyu and built gardens and tea houses while in Tokushima. After three years serving Iemasa, S≈çko was solicited by Asano Yoshinaga to join his clan ruling Kish≈´ Province. S≈çko came to Hiroshima in service of the Asano Clan as Chief Retainer (kar≈ç ÂÆ∂ËÄÅ) and tea master of the Hiroshima Domain in 1619.Ueda, S≈çkei; Ueda, S≈çk≈ç (2011).

Style of Chanoyu  Ueda S≈çko attended Riky≈´'s chanoyu practice (the Japanese Way of Tea) as a student for six years before becoming a student of Furuta Oribe for 24 years. S≈çko was very close to Furuta Oribe and reverence for his teacher can be seen in the design of Waf≈´d≈ç (tea villa built on the grounds of Hiroshima Castle). S≈çko more or less replicates Oribe's tea house 'Ennan ÁáïÂ∫µ' in the tea house 'Ensh≈ç ÈÅ†Èêò' (meaning 'distant resonance of a temple bell') built at Waf≈´d≈ç.‰∏äÁî∞ÂÆ∂Ëå∂Êõ∏ÈõÜÊàê, published by Â∫ÉÂ≥∂Â∏ÇÊïôËÇ≤ÂßîÂì°‰ºö, Hiroshima 2005 The only difference is the addition of an additional tatami mat in size, requested by Asano Nagaakira. In Ensh≈ç, S≈çko recreated an 'Oribe- kaku' tea room. This is small, wabi-cha tearoom with an extra tatami mat added to the left of the alcove to form a small passageway. The mat can be partitioned off or used to accommodate more guests. After koicha (thick tea), the extra mat called sh≈çban-datami is used as a corridor for the guests to pass from the small wabi-cha tea room to the larger kusari-no-ma tea room (the sh≈çban-datami is also used for vassals to wait for their lord during tea proceedings). In the left wall of the alcove of an Oribe-kaku tearoom there is a window made with woven wicker that opens to the sh≈çban-datami space. Oribe hung flower vases on this wicker window. All this was copied by S≈çko. Oribe favoured the spacious, kusari-no-ma style tea room that takes its name from a hanging kettle suspended by a chain from the ceiling. S≈çko also reproduced this at Waf≈´d≈ç as a shin (formal) tea room.Ued S≈çkei, Reconstruction of the Hiroshima Castle Ueda Residence, Ch≈´goku Insatsu Pty. Ltd. 2010 In S≈çko's tea garden at Waf≈´d≈ç, he uses a 'naka-kuguri' (small opening in a high wall) for guests to pass between the outer and inner roji (tea garden) ‚Äì again used by Oribe. S≈çko assisted Oribe in establishing a distinct genre of chanoyu for the warrior class referred to as buke sad≈ç (Ê≠¶ÂÆ∂Ëå∂ÈÅì) or 'warrior tea'. As a dedicated tea disciple of Oribe, Ueda S≈çko designed the Waf≈´d≈ç tea complex inside Hiroshima Castle to conduct the new sukiya onari format.Ueda S≈çkei, Reconstruction of the Hiroshima Castle Ueda Residence, First printed on 21 November 2010 by Ch≈´goku Insatsu Pty. Ltd. 2010 This shows that he and Oribe where in close communication during the time Oribe contrived this new format of chanoyu with Tokugawa Hidetada. From S≈çko's tea house design and the provisions he made for conducting chaji (formal tea gatherings), S≈çko's style of chanoyu appears to be one that favoured a flow in proceedings, where guests experienced different gardens and tea rooms in the space of one gathering. This is in line with Oribe's style of tea rather than Riky≈´'s (Riky≈´ favoured small, two mat tearooms and gatherings where guests would keep to one room for the duration). S≈çko's tea aesthetics were also influenced by Riky≈´. In the Notes from S≈çko (S≈çko-sama o-kikigaki) manuscript it is written: \\"The tips of Oribe's chashaku are free-flowing curves, but the tips of S≈çko's chashaku have a bent or sharp angle, reminiscent of Rikyu's chashaku\\". S≈çko is considered to have harmonised both Riky≈´'s wabi aesthetics and Oribe's aesthetics of hy≈çge (warped and playful). Unlike Riky≈´ and Oribe who commissioned tea wares from artisans, S≈çko made his own tea wares. In this pursuit he was one of the first warrior class teaists to craft o-niwa-yaki, tea bowls and other ceramic tea utensils fired in the garden of their castle residence (o-niwa-yaki means \\"fired in the garden\\"). The spirit of Ueda S≈çko's chanoyu can be seen in the layout of his tea villa, Waf≈´d≈ç. Pine trees were planted on the crossing bridge from the shoin residence to the tea pavilion to suggest crossing over to J≈çdo (Buddhist Pure Land)Ê≠¶ÂÆ∂Ëå∂ÈÅì„Å®Â∫ÉÂ≥∂ÊñáÂåñÔΩû„Åù„ÅÆÁ≤æÁ•û„Å®Áèæ‰ª£ÊÄß Samurai Tea & Hiroshima Culture: The Spirit & Modernity, Lecture given by Ueda S≈çkei, 16th Grandmaster of the Ueda S≈çko-ry≈´ and broadcast on NHK Radio. During battle campaigns, S≈çko would pass the time waiting for enemy forces by carving tea scoops. Examples are the chashaku named teki-gakure (waiting for the enemy). The only extant calligraphy work of S≈çko is the single line scroll 'I welcome no layman to my abode'„ÄåÈñÄÁÑ°‰øóÂ£´Èßï„Äç(mon (ni) zokushi (no) ga nashi). The implication of the characters is \\"Upon mastering oneself through discipline and cultivating morality, those without such education and taste for the arts cease to appear at one's door\\". Throughout a life lived in the turbulent Warring States period, S≈çko pursued a style of chanoyu that developed quietude for the mind and strength of spirit, deeply influenced by Zen morality. S≈çko created his school of tea with view for it to be transmitted through future generations. S≈çko invested the teaching of his style of chanoyu into two families, the Normura and Nakamura. This role was called chaji azukari or Chief Retainers of the Teaching of Chanoyu. The first of these were Nomura Ky≈´mu and Nakamura Mototomo. The families also served as S≈çko's vassals, controlling fiefs of 100 koku of rice each, given to them by S≈çko. Under S≈çko's direction, the Nomura and Nakamura families taught and conducted chanoyu for the Asano and Ueda families. It is thanks to this structure that the Ueda S≈çko-ry≈´ continues to the present day.Ueda, S≈çkei; Ueda, S≈çk≈ç (2011). The Ueda S≈çko Tradition of Cha-no-yu, Introductory Edition ÂÖ•ÈñÄÁ∑® ‰∏äÁî∞ÂÆóÁÆáÊµÅËå∂„ÅÆÊπØ. Hiroshima: Ê†™Âºè‰ºöÁ§æÁ¨¨‰∏ÄÂ≠¶ÁøíÁ§æ. pp. 120‚Äì124.  Teacher, Furuta Oribe  Ueda S≈çko learned from Furuta Oribe for 24 years. Daimy≈ç Asano Yoshinaga had Ueda S≈çko question Furuta Oribe about chanoyu on his behalf (in the position of Yoshinaga's Chief Retainer and tea master). S≈çko recorded Oribe's responses and delivered them to Asano Yoshinaga. The studious work of S≈çko compiling Oribe's teachings survives in the manuscript known variously as Question and Answer with Oribe (Ëå∂ÈÅìÈï∑ÂïèÁπîÁ≠îÊäÑ) and A Record of S≈çho's Enquiries to Oribe (ÂÆóÁî´ÂÖ¨Âè§ÁπîÊ±üÂæ°Â∞ãÊõ∏). It is one of the central documents for understanding the chanoyu of Furuta Oribe. The manuscript was shared with tea master for the Tokugawa shogunate, Kobori Ensh≈´. This proves that Ueda S≈çko and Kobori Ensh≈´ shared intimate correspondence on chanoyu. Both were leading disciples of Furuta Oribe. The tradition of sukiya onari (the sh≈çgun visiting a daimy≈çs residence for a formal tea gathering) started during the rule of Tokugawa Hidetada, the second generation Tokugawa sh≈çgun. Furuta Oribe was Hidetada's tea master at this time and assumed a directorial role in the development of sukiya onari, a format of tea gathering especially for the warrior class, designed for entertaining the sh≈çgun and daimy≈ç. Following Oribe's ideas, Ueda S≈çko designed the Waf≈´d≈ç tea complex inside Hiroshima Castle to cater for the new sukiya onari format. After entering the castle gates for an official visit, the sh≈çgun would first enter a roji (tea garden) and participate in chanoyu (a formal tea gathering) as the first part of the visit. The tea gathering would proceed from the sukiya (wabi-cha tearoom) to the kusari-no-ma (formal room with hanging kettle). Upon concluding chanoyu, the sh≈çgun would cross to the shoin reception complex via a covered bridge where traditional entertainment from the time of the Ashikaga shogunate would take place.Ueda S≈çkei, Reconstruction of the Hiroshima Castle Ueda Residence, Ch≈´goku Insats, 2010 The current home of the Ueda S≈çko-ry≈´ is a reconstruction of the Waf≈´d≈ç built by Ueda S≈çko on the grounds of Hiroshima Castle. As such, it provides a rare example of the warrior style of chanoyu developed by Furuta Oribe and Ueda S≈çko.

Waf≈´d≈ç, Hiroshima Castle  S≈çko constructed a second waf≈´d≈ç tea house complex on the main residence of the Ueda family on the grounds of Hiroshima Castle. This Waf≈´d≈ç reflected the original Waf≈´d≈ç built in Kish≈´ Province. The Hiroshima Waf≈´d≈ç included a sukiya tearoom called Ensh≈ç, a kusari-no-ma tearoom called Kenkei and the training complex Ankantei. As part of the construction S≈çko planted a pine at the summit of Shij≈çyama mountain. The pine is known as S≈çko Matsu (\\"Soko's Pine\\") and the mountain is also known as S≈çkoyama (\\"Mount S≈çko\\").  Death  Ueda S≈çko died at 88 years of age. His oldest son was required to serve the Edo Bakufu which left his second eldest son, Shigemasa, to become heir of the Ueda family in Hiroshima. When Shigemasa died on 10 April at age 44, S≈çko abstained from food and water from the same day until passing away 21 days later on 1 May (by the lunar calendar). According to S≈çko's biography, on the morning of the 1st, S≈çko rose, purified his mouth, drank tea and lay down dead. S≈çko's ashes were ground into dust and set adrift on the current of the Seto Inland Sea.

Upland blanket bogs cover basalt rocks, and flushing by mineral-enriched water has resulted in the formation of alkaline fen vegetation. There are small areas of standing and running water but bogs, marshes, water fringed vegetation and fens cover 70% of the area. The remainder is heath and scrubland, humid grassland and mesophile grassland. The peatland complex is composed of a series of raised and flushed peat bog and oligotrophic lakes. Plants include Erica tetralix, Trichophorum cespitosum, Eriophorum vaginatum, dwarf-shrubs and Sphagnum papillosum, Sphagnum fuscum and Sphagnum imbricatum.

Mayor Bill de Blasio described the incident as \\"an attempted terrorist attack\\". The suspected bomber was identified by police as 27-year-old Akayed Ullah, a Salafi Muslim immigrant from Bangladesh. Events At approximately 7:20 a.m., during morning rush hour, a pipe bomb partially detonated in the New York City Subway's Times Square‚Äì42nd Street/Port Authority Bus Terminal station, within the underground passageway between Seventh and Eighth Avenues. The suspected bomber was taken to Bellevue Hospital for treatment. There were four non-life-threatening injuries. According to the city's fire department commissioner, the suspect suffered burns to his hands and torso while three bystanders had \\"ringing ears and headaches\\". The bombing severely disrupted subway service for several hours, leading to a slight decline in ridership.  Perpetrator  upright After the incident, the Port Authority Police Department (PAPD) arrested a \\"would-be suicide bomber\\" armed with a pipe bomb (which was filled with sugar and Christmas tree lightsPort Authority bomb was made of Christmas lights, sugar and a battery: cops, New York Post, December 11, 2017) and a battery pack. The suspect was identified as 27-year-old Brooklyn resident Akayed Ullah. One year after he arrived in the US, his father died. He subsequently converted to Salafism and pressured his family to pray regularly and adopt conservative religious beliefs. Ullah's wife and child live in Bangladesh, where he kept books by Muhammad Jasimuddin Rahmani, the spiritual leader of extremist group Ansarullah Bangla Team which is linked to the terror group al- Qaeda in the Indian Subcontinent. Ullah wrote handwritten notes on his passport, including ‚ÄúO AMERICA, DIE IN YOUR RAGE.‚Äù He was a licensed cab driver from March 2012 to March 2015. He had posted a warning on Facebook, \\"Trump you failed to protect your nation\\", before the attack. Prosecutors allege he told police after the blast \\"I did it for the Islamic State.\\" After being questioned, Ullah reportedly said he was \\"following ISIS on the internet and reading Inspire magazine\\". Through online instructions, he learned how to make the explosive device. A law enforcement source told CNN that Ullah said he carried out the attack in response to recent Israeli actions in Gaza over Donald Trump's recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital. The Associated Press, however, reported law enforcement sources told them he was retaliating against U.S. military aggression. Authorities believed he also sought reprisal for American air attacks on Muslims in Syria and elsewhere. According to statements by law enforcement officials, reported in The New York Times, he chose the Times Square area because of its Christmas-themed advertising. During court proceedings, Ullah denied being an ISIS sympathizer, saying he \\"was angry with Donald Trump because he said he will bomb the Middle East and protect his nation.\\" Ullah had at times frequented the Masjid Nur Al Islam, a mosque in Kensington, Brooklyn, which was placed on the NYPD Intelligence Division's \\"Mosques of Interest\\" list in 2004. Four members of the mosque are also on the NYPD's \\"Most Dangerous\\" list. Ullah is a permanent U.S. resident. His uncle won a diversity visa lottery which enabled him to bring Ullah to the United States under the family reunification provisions of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965. Legal proceedings Ullah was charged with possessing a criminal weapon, making terroristic threats and supporting an act of terrorism. In early November 2018, he was found guilty on all counts. He was sentenced on April 5, 2019 to life imprisonment without parole. Ullah is currently incarcerated in the Metropolitan Correctional Center, New York.https://www.bop.gov/inmateloc/ Reaction President Donald Trump said, \\"There have now been two terrorist attacks in New York City in recent weeks carried out by foreign nationals here on green cards. The first attacker came through the visa lottery, the second came through chain migration. We‚Äôre going to end both of them.\\" He called for the end of the Diversity Immigrant Visa and chain migration after this attack, and had made a similar statement following the October 31, 2017, truck attack in Lower Manhattan. The Bangladeshi consulate in New York City condemned the attack and reiterated the Bangladeshi government policy of zero tolerance against terrorism. Bangladeshi-Americans in New York City denounced the attack, as well as President Trump's suggestion to end chain migration. Bangladesh's Counterterrorism Police stated that they did not find a link between Ullah and domestic terrorist groups in Bangladesh. The counterterrorism police also said that they had placed his family members under surveillance after the attack.

(31 August 1942 ‚Äì 22 April 2015) was a Danish cardiologist at Rigshospitalet in Copenhagen, Denmark. Rigshospitalet was until February 2017 the largest hospital in Denmark; only surpassed by Skejby Sygehus, however, Rigshospitalet is a flagship in the Danish health care system. From 1990 until his death in 2015, Mortensen was the medical director of the heart transplantation unit at Rigshospitalet. He was a fellow of the European Society of Cardiologists. Mortensen is best known as the chief researcher and the leading author for the Q-Symbio study of the ‚ÄúEffect of Coenzyme Q10 on Morbidity and Mortality in Chronic Heart Failure.‚Äù  Coenzyme Q10 Research  Mortensen was one of the first researchers, along with Dr. Gian-Paulo Littarru, Dr. Per Langsjoen, and Dr. William V. Judy, to work with Dr. Karl Folkers, who urged more research into the use of Coenzyme Q10 as an adjuvant treatment for heart failure patients. The early collaboration with Dr. Folkers led to the development of a study protocol for the Q-Symbio Study. The Q-Symbio study was a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo- controlled study that investigated the effectiveness of adjunctive treatment of chronic heart failure patients with daily Coenzyme Q10 supplements in the ubiquinone form. The patients took 300 milligrams of Coenzyme Q10 (100 milligrams three times daily, with meals) or matching placebos for two years. The results from the Q-Symbio study showed significantly improved symptoms and survival for the patients taking the active Coenzyme Q10 treatment together with their conventional heart failure medications.  Multiple treatment options with Coenzyme Q10  As a cardiologist, Mortensen saw multiple treatment options with Coenzyme Q10 in cardiovascular disease: * As a prophylactic treatment in statin therapy * As an adjunctive treatment of ischemic heart disease and angina pectoris * As a pretreatment for coronary artery bypass surgery or valve surgery * As an adjunctive treatment in arterial hypertension * As a prophylactic treatment in anthracycline therapy * As an adjunctive treatment in chronic heart failure  New guidelines for the management of heart failure  Following the publication of the results of the Q-Symbio study, Mortensen urged that the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines for the management of heart failure be revised to include adjunctive treatment with the natural substance Coenzyme Q10. He summarized the case for Coenzyme Q10 as an adjunctive treatment for heart failure: * Safety: no serious side effects recorded in RCTs * Interactions: no definite drug interactions reported * Efficacy: ** RCTs: reduced hospitalizations and reduced mortality for heart failure patients **Meta-analyses of RCTs: improved left ventricular ejection fraction and improved NYHA class * Formulations: best bio-availability of the Coenzyme Q10 when it is dissolved in vegetable oil and administered in capsules manufactured under pharmaceutical quality control  Coenzyme Q10 and the ‚Äúenergy starved heart‚Äù  Mortensen's research prior to the Q-Symbio study had convinced him of the importance of adequate Coenzyme Q10 for the heart muscle cells: * He knew that there is an inverse correlation between the concentrations of Coenzyme Q10 in the heart muscle tissue and the severity of heart failure. * He suspected that energy starvation of the myocardium (the ‚Äúenergy starved heart‚Äù) is a dominant feature of heart failure; his research efforts were focused on finding a well-tolerated agent (Coenzyme Q10) to improve the energy and force of the heart muscle. * He liked the safe and positive way in which Coenzyme Q10 adjunctive treatment improved heart function; Coenzyme Q10 as a medication did not block any neurohormonal responses in the heart. Instead, Coenzyme Q10 naturally enhanced the process of producing energy in the heart muscle cells. * He was aware that statin medications inhibit not only the bio-synthesis of cholesterol but also the bio-synthesis of Coenzyme Q10, thereby reducing the level of Coenzyme Q10 in the blood and in the heart muscle tissue.  Concern for heart failure patients  Mortensen's highest concern was the welfare of his heart failure patients and heart transplantation patients. He knew that heart failure is a disabling disease that diminishes the quality of life of the patients. It is a disease with an increasing prevalence. It is a disease that continues to have a poor prognosis even though advances have been made in various drug and medical device therapies. Mortensen's research established Coenzyme Q10 adjunctive treatment as a way to improve heart failure outcomes and break the metabolic vicious cycle in the heart muscle.

Ahead of the Test series, there was a two-day practice match in Vadodara. Jason Holder was ruled out of the first Test due to an injury, with Kraigg Brathwaite captaining the West Indies in his place. India won the match, their 100th win in Tests at home. India went on to win the second Test by 10 wickets, winning the series 2‚Äì0. It was India's tenth consecutive series win at home in Tests. The second ODI was the 950th ODI to be played by India, becoming first team to achieve the milestone. During the match, India's captain Virat Kohli became the fastest batsman to score 10,000 runs in ODIs, taking 205 innings, beating the previous record of 259 innings set by Sachin Tendulkar. India went on to win the five-match ODI series 3‚Äì1, after the second ODI ended in a tie. India's regular wicket-keeper for limited overs matches, MS Dhoni, was not named in the side's squad for the T20I fixtures for this series and the ones against Australia. Instead, India's Test wicket-keeper, Rishabh Pant, was selected in Dhoni's place. Rohit Sharma was also named as India's captain for the T20I matches against the West Indies, with Virat Kohli being rested. India won the T20I series 3‚Äì0. Background Originally, one of the ODI matches had been allocated to the Greenfield International Stadium in Thiruvananthapuram, per the Board of Control for Cricket in India's (BCCI) Tours and Fixtures Committee. However, when the fixtures were announced in March 2018, the match was allocated to the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium in Kochi instead. The Kerala Cricket Association (KCA) requested that the BCCI reviews the decision. Two days later, the BCCI announced the fixture would be played in Thiruvananthapuram. In September 2018, it was confirmed that the Ekana International Cricket Stadium in Lucknow would host its first ever international match. The last time Lucknow hosted an international match was in January 1994, when India played a Test match against Sri Lanka at the K. D. Singh Babu Stadium. Later the same month, it was reported that the second ODI match may be moved from the Holkar Stadium in Indore, due to a row about complimentary-ticket allocations. On 3 October 2018, the BCCI confirmed that the second ODI would be moved to the Dr. Y. S. Rajasekhara Reddy ACA‚ÄìVDCA Cricket Stadium, in Visakhapatnam. On 12 October 2018, the BCCI moved the fourth ODI from the Wankhede Stadium to Brabourne Stadium due to administrative issues. On the day before the second T20I, the Ekana Stadium was renamed in honour of Atal Bihari Vajpayee.

The shield was circular shaped with a diameter between 30 cm to 90 cm. It was tied to the warrior's body with ropes or leather strips that passed over the shoulder and that gave great mobility to fight both on foot and on horseback. The shapes and decorations of the shields had variations in their metal, wood or leather protection. Warriors that carried this shield were usually light infantry called caetratus (pl. Caetrati).  Description  This 30 to 90 cm (1ft to 3ft) diameter light round shield was constructed from wood sections attached by two metal bars of bronze, copper or iron; it was then covered with leather. Although the caetra was commonly round, it took on many shapes and sizes. Size varied from 90 cm (3ft) to perhaps 30 cm (1ft) in diameter. All shields had metal fittings and ornaments on the face with an iron boss in the middle, added to deflect sword blows as well as arrows and spears. In combat, the shield was not only effective at blocking, but was also an extremely proficient secondary weapon. Iberian troops used the boss to punch opponents. On the move these compact bucklers could be hung on a belt or across the back by a strap, so as not to be burdensome to the soldier on the march or forging for food, but still handy for when the enemy was close. Cavalrymen would usually carry the caetra so as to not over encumber their mounts or limit their horsemanship.

The little girls go through a series of adventures from which they learn to distinguish good and evil; this is especially true of Marguerite de Rosbourg, the youngest, who has good intentions, but doesn't come up to the standards of Camille and Madeleine. A new character arrives in the seventh chapter : F√©dora Fichini, a woman who has become Sophie's stepmother. She is particularly cruel with Sophie, punishing and whipping her. Sophie, who has lost her parents, her uncle, aunt and cousin since Sophie‚Äôs Misfortunes, occasionally comes with her stepmother to play at the Fleurville mansion. Sophie is not \\"bad\\", but Camille and Madeleine have to be patient and understanding for there to remain a pleasant atmosphere. Marguerite, who is less mature, sometimes has trouble accepting Sophie, who is quick-tempered, vivacious and sometimes dishonest. The three girls understand that Sophie's gluttony and her dishonesty are mainly caused by her fear of Madame Fichini, for whom \\"the whip is the best teacher‚Äù and ‚Äúthe only way to raise children‚Äù. As concerns Madame de Fleurville and Madame de Rosbourg, they both hate Madame Fichini, but show nothing of their distaste, to make sure that Sophie can keep coming to play with Camille, Madeleine and Marguerite. Once they have managed to convince Madame Fichini to leave her stepdaughter with them, Sophie makes great headway. Yet she will have to lose some of her various deeply-set flaws. ‚ÄúDear Camille, I know that I will always stay bad; I will never be as good as you are‚Äù, she says in one the chapters.

The ODI fixtures were part of both teams' preparation for the 2019 Cricket World Cup. South Africa's Boxing Day Test was held at Centurion Park in Centurion for the first time. In the first session of the match, Dale Steyn became South Africa's leading wicket- taker in Tests, taking his 422nd wicket, surpassing Shaun Pollock who had held the record for ten years. South Africa's captain Faf du Plessis was penalised for a slow over-rate in the second Test and was suspended for the third and final Test of the series. Dean Elgar was named as the stand-in captain for the third Test. South Africa won the Test series 3‚Äì0. During the second ODI, Pakistan's captain Sarfaraz Ahmed was caught on the stump mics making a racist comment towards Andile Phehlukwayo. Sarfraz played in the third ODI match, but was then suspended by the International Cricket Council (ICC) for the next four matches, missing the last two ODIs and the first two T20Is of the tour. Shoaib Malik was named as the captain for the fourth and fifth ODIs and the T20I series. The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) were disappointed with the ICC's decision to suspend Sarfraz, after Sarfraz apologised in person to Phehlukwayo before the start of the third ODI. South Africa went on to win the ODI series 3‚Äì2. Faf du Plessis was rested for the last two T20Is of the series, with David Miller named as the captain of South Africa in his place.

Hu Yan assisted Prince Chong'er (posthumously the \\"Wen Duke\\") during his long exile, his usurpation of his nephew Yu, and his rise to hegemonic status over the other states of the Zhou Kingdom. The Legalist Han Fei considered Hu Yan one of the best advisors of ancient China, and the historian Sima Qian listed him with Sun Tzu as the greatest tacticians of the age. Names Hu Yan is a Chinese name: Hu is the surname and Yan is the given name. His courtesy name was Zifan (\\"Master\\" or \\"Viscount Fan\\"). Classical sources also refer to him as Jiu Ji and Jiu Fan (\\"Uncle Fan\\"),. in reference to his relationship to Chong'er through his mother's line. He is also sometimes known as Sikong Jizi (\\"Minister of Works\\"). Life Hu Yan was born in 715 into the leadership of one of the \\"barbarian\\" Di tribes who lived north of China during the Zhou. His father was Hu Tu (), his brother Hu Mao (), and his sister Hu Ji ().. The family was closely tied to the branch of the House of Ji who ruled Jin in present-day Shanxi. Some sources even make the Hu descendants of Shu Yu and thus distant cousins of the dukes of Jin and the kings of Zhou.. Hu Tu served as the charioteer for the Jin prince Shensheng against the Red Di tribes of Gaoluo (). Hu Ji became one of the wives of Jin's Duke Guizhu (posthumously, the \\"Xian Duke\\"). When the machinations of the concubine Li Ji led to the ritual suicide of Shensheng in 656, Hu Tu retired from public service and ceased to leave his home. Hu Ji's son Chong'er replaced him as crown prince. Hu Yan was counted among his 5 Worthies ().. When Li Ji successfully framed him for an attempted rebellion, he was compelled to flee from his seat in Pu to his mother's tribe in the north. Hu Yan either fled with him from his court at Pu or joined his retinue among the Di. After the Jin minister Li Ke () had Li Ji, her son, and her nephew killed in 651, he offered the throne to Chong'er but was declined. Another of Chong'er's younger half-brothers, Yiwu (posthumously, the \\"Hui Duke\\"), then took his place. Yiwu was captured in battle by Duke Renhao of Qin (posthumously, the \\"Mu Duke\\"); upon his liberation and return to Jin, he found that many of his ministers supported his replacement by his half-brother Chong'er. Yiwu then sent assassins against him in 644, causing Chong'er and his followers to flee the Di and wander among the courts of China. The Discourses of the States records that it was Hu Yan who convinced Chong'er that it was necessary to leave.. Hu Yan, Hu Mao, Xian Zhen (), Jie Zhitui, Zhao Cui, Wei Chou (), and Jia Tuo () were among those who traveled with him from the Di to Qi. In Qi, Duke Xiaobai (posthumously the \\"Huan Duke\\") treated Chong'er with such generosity that he did not wish to leave at all. Hu Yan conspired under a mulberry tree with some of the other Jin exiles, planning to abduct the prince and force him to concern himself with matters of state. The prince's wife Qi Jiang killed the young silk worker who overheard them and reported to her; although she told her husband of his advisors' plans, she advised him to permit his own abduction, as it was for the best. He refused, saying that he chose to end his days idling in Qi. Qi Jiang then joined the conspirators and, getting him drunk, helped Hu in carrying him off.. When Chong'er recovered, he seized a spear and threatened Hu, crying, \\"If we succeed, fine! but if we don't, then I will eat your flesh as if I can never get my fill!\\" The party then passed to Cao, Song, Zheng, and Chu, passing through other states as they went. After its duke disrespected Chong'er while he was passing through Wey, the prince was ready to beat a peasant who offered him a clod of dirt instead of food. Hu Yan supposedly intervened, kowtowed to the peasant, and loaded the dirt into his wagon, taking it as a portent that Jin would later take the peasant's territory Wulu ().. Chong'er, Hu Yan, and the others were invited to Qin after Yiwu's death. There, Duke Renhao supported their overthrow of Yiwu's son Yu (posthumously, the \\"Huai Duke\\"). During Yu's brief period of rule in 637, he attempted to force Hu Tu to compel his sons to return to Jin and cease supporting the cause of Chong'er. When Hu Tu refused, he was executed. A map of the armies at the 632 Battle of Chengpu, including some of the minor states of the era Chinese chariot When the Qin army reached the border of Jin, Hu Yan made a great show of humility. He apologized for his many faults while in Chong'er's service and, offering him a jade disk, tendered his resignation. Poised to be the next duke of Jin, Chong'er threw the disk into the Yellow River and called upon it to witness that he would not forget those who had followed him in adversity... Jie Zhitui was so disgusted by what he took to be presumption and insincerity on both sides that he withdrew silently from Chong'er's service.. Hu Yan served Chong'er as a general in the Jin army. In 635, he led men from Jin in assisting the restoration of King Zheng (posthumously the \\"Xiang King\\") against the usurper Shu Dai (). In 633, he served as the assistant commander of the Central Army (). The next year, he was one of the leaders of the Jin contingent that secured a major victory over Chu at Chengpu, somewhere in southern Henan or Shandong. Hu Yan was strongly supportive of the Jin position prior to the battle and even interpreted the Duke of Jin's dream‚Äîin which the Duke of Chu bent him over and began sucking out his brains‚Äîas a favorable omen. A passage in the Han Feizi credits Hu Yan with the successful tactics used by the coalition against Chu at Chengpu, but states that Chong'er subsequently rewarded Yong Ji instead because his advice had been to avoid deception and‚Äîwhile that had been less useful during wartime‚Äîit became better once peace was secured. Confucius praised this behavior, but Han Fei considered it textbook misadministration. He goes so far as listing Hu Yan as the most capable and important of Duke Chong'er's men and one of the prime \\"Assistants to Hegemonic Rulers\\" in ancient China. Han Fei says such assistants worked hard without concern for their health, rising early and retiring late, thinking cautiously but speaking frankly, holding their lord and state ahead of their own families and careers, and advising well but behaving humbly. He concludes, \\"Ministers like these, even under stupid and outrageous masters, could still achieve meritorious service. How much more could they do under brilliant sovereigns?\\". In 630, Hu Yan was one of the Jin representatives to the conference at Diquan (), near present-day Luoyang in Henan, where Prince Hu () tried to create a general alliance of the Zhou Kingdom's vassal states of Lu, Song, Qi, Chen, Qin, Cai, and Jin. He died in 629. His son was Hu Shegu (, H√∫ Sh√®g≈´). Legacy Centuries later, Han Fei still considered the incident between Chong'er and Hu Yan in Qi as a classic example of how rulers sometimes depend on their followers and advisors for their success. Sima Qian placed Hu Yan beside Sun Tzu in a list of \\"famous soldiers\\" who \\"developed and threw new light on the principles of war\\", although no treatise in his name similar to the Art of War survives from antiquity. A passage in the Han Feizi suggests that Hu Yan was credited in antiquity with legitimizing and popularizing the use of deception in Chinese warfare.. By offending Jie Zhitui into early retirement, Hu Yan may also be considered indirectly responsible for China's Cold Food and Tomb-Sweeping Festivals. Hu Yan was portrayed by Zhang Rihui () in the 1996 TV documentary Later Years of the Zhou Dynasty: Spring and Autumn Period () and by You Liping () in the 2011 TV drama Song of Spring and Autumn.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2017. History The first school building in what is now Wyandotte was constructed in 1837. A new school as constructed in 1856, and a Central Union high school was built in 1869. The first school on the site of the present McKinley Elementary School was constructed in 1872, and was known as the Third Ward school. This school was demolished in 1901, and replaced with a new building designed by Malcomson and Higginbotham, and named McKinley Elementary School. By 1937, this was the oldest elementary school in the district, and the school board began considering replacing it. After exploring funding sources, the board finally approved construction of a new building in late 1938. The school district hired architect Carl R. Jensen of Detroit to design the building, and the O.W. Burke Company to construct it. The school opened in March 1940. The school continued in use until 2009, when declining enrollment led the school board to close it. As of 2017, the building is being rehabilitated for housing. Coachlight Properties LLC and Jonesboro Investment Corp. will redevelop the building into 60 market-rate senior apartments. Description McKinley Elementary School is a two-story Art deco-style building faced with multi-tone orange brick. the front facade has a raised foundation clad with limestone. It is divided into three main sections: an auditorium in the center and the east and west wings. The central auditorium section is six bays wide, and projects forward from the wings. Six limestone- framed openings in the central section extend two stories above the foundation. Each side wing is eight bays wide, and has a one-story-tall projecting limestone porch entrance abutting the auditorium. The porches shelter a recessed entrance. Above each entrance are three narrow window openings separated by square brick piers topped with limestone. The next four bays of the wings are separated by brick piers and have a set of four windows at the first and second floors. Each bay has a limestone cornice running across the top. The three end bays project slightly, and contain two-story openings framed with limestone, containing windows. The interior of the building has corridors with terrazzo floors and glazed tile wainscoting with plaster walls above. Inset in the floors on the first story are four medallions designed by Fred Frostic, superintendent of Wyandotte Public Schools at the time the school was built, and his daughter Gwen Frostic. The staircases to the upper floor are metal with terrazzo treads and metal balustrades. Classrooms generally have vinyl tile floors, plaster walls with wood trim, and bulletin and marker boards framed with wood. The kindergarten room has a fireplace surrounded with decorative tile featuring nursery rhyme characters and animals. The school also has an auditorium and gymnasium.

It was written by Gerry Duggan and drawn by Dustin Weaver. The series was initially published between July 2015 and January 2016 before being collected into a single volume. The story is set on Battleworld, in a realm where the 2006 Annihilation storyline had an alternate ending.http://herocomplex.latimes.com/comics/infinity-gauntlet-no-1-preview- gerry-duggan-dustin-weaver-get-cosmic/#/0 Plot The Bakian Clan (a group of humans who survived the attacks of the Annihilation Wave) are shadowed by an unknown figure as they scrounge for food in the ruins of New Xandar, but their dog Zigzag is only able to find canned dog food for them to eat. Later that night, Menzin tells his youngest daughter Fayne about how her mother left to reinforce the Nova Corps and will someday return. The elder daughter Anwen believes their mother to be dead as evidenced by the arrival of the Annihilation Wave. An argument between their father and the girls' maternal grandfather ensues which attracts the attention of the bugs forcing the Bakian Clan to flee for their lives. During the resulting chase, Anwen falls into a bug nest. As she fights for her life, she discovers the Mind Infinity Gem. Hearing explosions on the surface, she climbs out and comes face to face with a Nova who removes her helmet, revealing herself to be Anwen's mother as the two then embrace. Anwen's mother says \\"everything will be alright\\". Meanwhile, Thanos watching from the shadows in a building disagrees with what he overheard and it is revealed he has the Time Gem.Infinity Gauntlet Vol. 2 #1 Eve reunited Anwen with the rest of the Bakian clan and gave each of them Nova suits. After escaping from a horde of bugs by using the Mind Gem Anwen had found, they tried to retreat to the Nova HQ, but found the place wrecked with the Novas stationed there killed and the gem in their possession missing. At the other side of New Xandar, Star-Lord returns to Gamora who is revealed to be the possessor of the gem (the Space Gem) that was on the Nova HQ, having scavenged the HQ and found it between the attack and the Bakians' arrival.Infinity Gauntlet Vol. 2 #2 As he had gone back in time to before the Bakian clan reunited with Eve, Thanos posed as an ally, to the point of giving them the Time Gem to earn their trust, and accompanied them in their journey, which remained the same as originally. After finding the ravaged Nova HQ, the Bakian clan and Thanos confronted Star-Lord and Gamora, forcing them to stop fighting by using the Mind Stone. In exchange for three Nova Stars, they acquired the Space Gem. Because they wanted to achieve a common goal, the destruction of the Annihilation Wave, Star-Lord and Gamora joined the Bakian clan and Thanos in their mission. The next gem, the Power Stone, was found being protected by Groot, who gave it to them and joined their party.Infinity Gauntlet Vol. 2 #3 Through a vision, Eve was guided by the Stones to Magus City, a sanctuary under the protection of Adam Warlock (wielder of the Soul Stone) who used it to keep the Annihilation Wave at bay. Unbeknown to the Balkian and their allies, Adam also fed on the souls of the inhabitants of the city to power himself and keep the monsters away. When the Balkian were received by Warlock and his Knights of Xandar, Eve went straight to the point and demanded to take the Soul Stone to complete the Infinity Gauntlet and destroy the Annihilation Wave. Warlock opposed Eve leading to a fight for the ownership of the Stone, while the rest of the Balkian Clan and their allies confronted the Knights. Drax the Destroyer (a being bent on hunting down Thanos) interrupted into the battle and demanded the presence of Thanos. The Balkians attacked him, initially believing him to be an enemy. When Warlock used the Soul Stone on Eve to control her, she discovered the full use he gave to the Stone. Thanos tackled Warlock and saved Eve before her soul was consumed and took the Soul Stone for himself. Thanos turned to Eve and seemingly killed her before taking the other four Stones from her and unleashing their power.Infinity Gauntlet Vol. 2 #4 Critical reception The series debuted to positive reviews, averaging a score of 8.3 out of 10 based on 13 reviews according to review aggregator Comic Book Roundup.\\"The Infinity Gauntlet #1 Reviews (2015),\\" Comic Book Roundup.

In the Islamic Republic of Iran, the cigarettes are known as \\"57\\" and are manufactured by the Iranian Tobacco Company. History The brand was created in 1957 in the Socialist Republic of Slovenia and also became the first filtered cigarette in Yugoslavia. The difference from other brands at the time, such as Drina, Jadran, Drava and so on, was that these cigarettes were packed upside down, which made them a really popular smoke amongst the Slovenian working class. The reason for this, was that during work time, the hands of these workers were often dirty, and thus when they would grab a cigarette by the filter, it would get dirty too. However, if the filter laid at the bottom, the paper would get dirty when grabbed, but that wouldn't a problem because it would get burned up anyway, allowing the worker to place the filter in the mouth cleanly. In fact, this is an urban myth. According to the Museum of Contemporary History of Slovenia, a technical error was the true reason why \\"57\\" cigarettes were packed upside down. This brand got an almost cult-like following in socialist Slovenia. After the breakup of Yugoslavia, the cigarette is still largely popular in modern-day Slovenia, but the manufacturing operations of the \\"Tobaƒçna Ljubljana were ended. The brand had a 57% market share in the Yugoslavian cigarette market and represented almost 80% of the total production in 1962. An old Iranian pack of 57 cigarettes. Packaging The pack features primarily green and white colours, along with a dragon-like feature. Folk imagination provided an interesting interpretation of the visual image of the Filter 57 box, which says that in the contours of the dragon's head we can recognize a cup of coffee and in its hull an outline of Slovenia. The dragon-shaped arrow in the form of an arrow points to number 57, which means that the whole of Slovenia at the tea bath 57.

In an egalitarian-equivalent division, there exists a certain \\"reference bundle\\" Z such that each agent feels that his/her share is equivalent to Z. The EE fairness principle is usually combined with Pareto efficiency. A PEEEA is an allocation that is both Pareto efficient and egalitarian-equivalent.  Definition  A set of resources are divided among several agents such that every agent i receives a bundle X_i. Every agent i has a subjective preference relation \\\\succeq_i which is a total order over bundle. These preference relations induce an equivalence relation in the usual way: X \\\\sim_i Y iff X \\\\succeq_i Y \\\\succeq_i X. An allocation is called egalitarian-equivalent if there exists a bundle Z such that, for all i: :::X_i \\\\sim_i Z An allocation is called PEEEA if it is both Pareto-efficient and egalitarian-equivalent.  Motivation  The EE criterion was introduced by Elisha Pazner and David Schmeidler in 1978. Previously, the main fairness criterion in economics has been envy-freeness (EF). EF has the merit that it is an ordinal criterion --- it can be defined based only on individual preference-relations; it does not need to compare utilities of different agents, or to assume that the agents' utility functions are normalized. However, EF might be incompatible with Pareto efficiency (PE). In particular, in a standard economy with production, there may be no allocation which is both PE and EF. EE, like EF, is an ordinal criterion --- it can be defined based only on individual preference-relations. However, it is always compatible with PE --- a PEEEA (PE and EE Allocation) always exists, even in production economies. Pazner and Schmeidler informally describe a PEEEA as follows: :\\"Consider the case where there are two consumers and two commodities (but note that every step in the argument carries over to any number of agents and commodities...). Suppose that each consumer is given precisely half the total endowments. This egalitarian distribution will in general not be PE. Consider the ray in commodity space that goes from the origin through the vector of aggregate endowments. The egalitarian distribution is represented by each man being given the same bundle along this ray. :If the egalitarian distribution is not PE, then (by monotonicity and continuity of preferences) moving each man slightly up along the ray yields distributions of utilities that are still feasible, since the starting utility distribution is in the interior of the utility possibility set. In particular, if we simultaneously move each man up along the commodity ray in precisely the same manner, we eventually shall hit a utility distribution that lies on the utility possibility frontier. This means that there exists a Pareto-efficient allocation that is equivalent from the viewpoint of each consumer to the hypothetical (nonfeasible) distribution along the ray that would give to each consumer the same bundle (which, by being strictly greater than the egalitarian distribution of the aggregate endowments, is itself not feasible). This PE allocation is thus equivalent to the egalitarian distribution in the hypothetical (larger than the original) economy... :The resulting set of allocations is what we call the set of Pareto-efficient and egalitarian- equivalent allocations (PEEEA). It is a restriction of the Pareto set of the economy to those allocations having the specified equity property that their underlying utility levels distribution could have been generated by some egalitarian economy.\\".  Relation to the maximin criterion  As a special case, assume that there is a finite number of homogeneous divisible goods. Let W be a certain bundle. For every r\\\\in[0,1], let rW be the bundle in which the amount of each good is r times its amount in W. Suppose the preference- relation of each agent i is represented by a utility function V_i, which is calibrated such that: V_i(rW) = r. Then, a special case of an EE allocation is an allocation in which, for all i: :::V_i(X_i) = r In other words, all agents have the same calibrated utility. In this case, the Pareto-efficient EE allocation (PEEEA) coincides with the maximin allocation - the allocation that maximizes the minimum utility. Note that the maximin principle depends on numeric utility. Therefore, it cannot be used directly with ordinal preference-relations. The EE principle is ordinal, and it suggests a particular way to calibrate the utilities so that they can be used with the maximin principle. In the special case in which W is the bundle of all resources (the aggregate endowment), an egalitarian-equivalent division is also called an equitable division. Herve Moulin describes this special case of the EE rule as follows: :\\"The EE solution equalizes across agents the utilities measured along the \\"numeraire\\" of the commodity bundle to be divided. In other words, this solution gives to each participant an allocation that he or she views as equivalent (with his or her own preferences) to the same share of the pie, where the \\"pie\\" stands for the resources to be divided and a share is a homothetic reduction of the pie --- this is the same fraction of the total available amount of each commodity\\".  Example  The following example is based on . * There are three cities, A B and C. * There is a road from A to B and a road from B to C. * Each road can carry a total of 100 units of traffic. * There are 100 agents: 40 need to pass traffic from A to B, 30 from B to C, and 30 from A to C. * The utility of each agent equals the amount of traffic he is allowed to pass. So, if an agent gets x units of AB and y units of BC, his utility is x (if he is in the AB group), y (if he is in the BC group), or min(x,y) (if he is in the AC group). The question is how to divide the 100 units of capacity in each road among the 100 agents? Here are some possible solutions. * Suppose we give each agent the bundle (x=1,y=1), i.e, one unit of each road (so his utility is 1). This division is egalitarian, but it is obviously not PE, since the AB agents and the BC agents can improve their welfare by trading their shares in the roads they do not need. * Suppose we want to give each agent a utility of , for some r>1. Then, we have to allocate 40r + 30r units of AB and 30r + 30r units of BC. We can allocate at most 100 units of each road; therefore r \\\\leq 100/70 = 30/21 \\\\approx 1.43. The division where the AB agents get 30/21 units of AB, the BC agents get 30/21 units of BC, and the AC agents get 30/21 units of both roads, is egalitarian equivalent, since each agent is indifferent between his share and the constant bundle (x=30/21,y=30/21). It is also an equitable division, since the normalized utility of each agent is 30/21 However, this division is still not PE: it allocates 100 units of AB but only 600/7 units of BC. * We can make the above division PE by giving the remaining units of BC to the BC agents; this improves their utility to 40/21 \\\\approx 1.90 without harming the other agents. In the resulting allocation, each agent is indifferent between his share and the constant bundle (x=30/21,y=40/21). Therefore, this division too is egalitarian-equivalent. Now all capacities are allocated and the division is PE; therefore this is the PEEEA. Note that the resulting allocation is leximin-optimal - it maximizes the utility of the poorest agents, and subject to that, it maximizes the utility of the other agents.  Variant  Consider now the following variant on the above example. The utilities of the AB and BC agents are as above, but the utility of the AC agents when getting x units of AB and y units of BC is now (x+y)/2. Note that it is normalized such that their utility from having a unit of each resource is 1. * Suppose we want to give each agent a utility of , for some r>1. Then we have to allocate 40r + 30x units of AB and 30r + 30y units of BC, where x+y=2 r. Since there are 100 units of each good, we have r \\\\leq 200/130 = 60/39 \\\\approx 1.54. The division where the AB agents get 60/39 units of AB, the BC agents get 60/39 units of BC, and the AC agents get 50/39 of AB plus 70/39 of BC, is EE, since each agent is indifferent between his share and the constant bundle (x=60/39,y=60/39). It is also equitable, since the utility of all agents is 60/39. It is also PE, hence it is a PEEEA. Unfortunately, it is not EF since the BC agents envy the AC agents. Moreover, the bundle of an AC agent dominates the bundle of a BC agent: they get more of every resource, which seems quite unfair. * Instead of taking a reference bundle with equal amounts of each resource (r,r), we can take a reference bundle with different amounts (r,s). Then we have to allocate 40r + 30x units of AB and 30s + 30y units of BC, where x+y=r+s. Since there are 100 units of each good, we have 70 r+60 s \\\\leq 200. Combining this with an envy-freeness condition gives r=100/70=30/21\\\\approx 1.43, s=100/60=35/21\\\\approx 1.67. The division where the AB agents get 30/21 units of AB, the BC agents get 35/21 units of BC, and the AC agents get 30/21 units of AB plus 35/21 of BC, is EE, since each agent is indifferent between his share and the constant bundle (x=30/21,y=35/21). It is also PE, so it is PEEEA. It is also EF, so it is also PEEFA. However, it is not equitable: the relative utility of the AB agents is 30/21\\\\approx 1.43, of the BC agents - 35/21\\\\approx 1.67, and of the AC agents - 32.5/21\\\\approx 1.54. To summarize: in this example, a divider who believes in the importance of egalitarian-equivalence must choose between equitability and envy-freeness.  EE and EF  When there are two agents, the set of PEEE allocations contains the set of PEEF allocations. The advantage of PEEEA is that they exist even when there are no PEEFA. However, with three or more agents, the set of PE allocations that are both EE and EF might be empty. This is the case both in exchange economies with homogeneous divisible resources Postlewaite, in and in economies with indivisibilities.  Properties  In the special case in which the reference bundle contains a constant fraction of each good, the PEEEA rule has some more desirable properties: * proportionality: each agent believes that his share is at least as good as the bundle that contains 1/n of each resource. * Population monotonicity: when an agent leaves the scene and the resources are re-divided according to the same rule, each of the remaining agents is weakly better-off. However, it is lacking some other desirable properties: * envy-freeness: even though all agents believe that their bundle is equivalent to the same reference-bundle, they might still believe that another bundle is worth more than theirs. * resource monotonicity: when more resources are available for allocation and the resources are re-divided according to the same rule, some agents might be worse-off. In some settings, the PEEEA rule is equivalent to the Kalai-Smorodinsky bargaining solution.

When Emperor Buretsu died with no apparent heir, it was ≈åtomo no Kanamura who recommended Emperor Keitai, a very distant imperial relative who resided in Koshi Province, as the new monarch. However, Kanamura resigned due to the failure of his diplomatic policies, and the court was eventually controlled by the Mononobe and Soga clans at the beginning of the Asuka period.Brown, Delmer M.

Her younger brothers, John and Thomas, appeared as The Lady's Brothers. Henry Lawes, who wrote the music for the Maske, was Alice Egerton's music teacher. She was participating in a family tradition: her grandmother, Alice Spencer, Countess of Derby, a well- known patron of the arts, had herself appeared in Ben Jonson's The Masque of Queens in 1609 and was the honoree of Milton's masque Arcades. Alice Egerton married Richard Vaughan, 2nd Earl of Carbery in 1652, when she was aged about 33 and he was approximately twenty years older; they had no children. The earl succeeded Alice's father as Lord President of Wales following the Restoration of the monarchy in 1660, but he was later removed from the post.

The organisation is based in the UK and upskills mothers in practical digital skills. The organisation directs its focus on providing part-time, online courses that help equip graduates with job-ready skills so they can create flexible freelance careers. 10% of all their profits go into a Community Interest Company that funds women from low- income backgrounds to be able to do their training.  History  Digital Mums began in 2013 as a social media marketing agency in Hackney, London founded by Kathryn Tyler and Nikki Cochrane. After the founders read a report by the Fawcett Society that found fiscal measures taken to reduce net public spending in the UK would have a disproportionate effect on women, it evolved into a training organisation focused on upskilling mothers. In 2014 they received ¬£50,000 of seed investment money from The Big Issue Invest to support their efforts. In March 2016 the company raised ¬£285,000 in private equity and social investment funding to further scale the business. In October 2016 the Co-Founders were jointly awarded Red Magazine's Woman of the Year award in recognition of Digital Mums‚Äô contribution to reducing maternal discrimination in the UK.  Course Offerings  Digital Mums offers immersive, vocational courses in social media marketing lasting six and 12 months. Their courses are completed remotely and online, and incorporate real-life projects to get students job-ready. Digital Mums has been accredited by the CPD Standards Office. They also offer Professional Career Development Loans through the UK government‚Äôs Skills Funding Agency, to help students in need of financial assistance fund their learning.  Campaigns  Digital Mums has initiated several national campaigns supporting a number of causes related to flexible working and parenting. In February 2016, they launched a campaign in response to the controversial Motherhood Challenge, a Facebook campaign where mothers posted photos of themselves with their kids and tagged other women who they thought to be ‚Äòawesome‚Äô mothers. Their hashtag campaign #RealMumMoments was a bid to show ‚Äúmotherhood is never perfect and far from easy‚Äù by providing a humorous spin on the Motherhood Challenge. In September 2016, they produced a report in conjunction with the Centre for Economic and Business Research to look into the flexible working landscape for mothers in the UK. They found ‚Äú...more than two thirds of stay-at-home mothers with young children would go back to work if flexible working was an option.\\" They launched their #WorkThatWorks Movement in response to these figures as a way of opening up conversations around flexible working to support their drive to help mothers find rewarding careers that fit their skills and family life. In July 2017, the organisation launched their second campaign under the #WorkThatWorks Movement called #CleanUpTheFWord, which aimed to change the negative perception of flexible working. The campaign focused on new research conducted with YouGov that showed 7 in 10 UK employees want flexible work but over half fear it would be viewed negatively by their employer. They petitioned the UK government to change its definition of flexible working from \\"a way of working that suits an employee‚Äôs needs\\" to one that focuses on the benefits to employers too. Their campaign attracted the attention of the Equalities and Human Rights Commission who they worked with on a new definition for flexible working.

It is one of four superfamilies classified as part of the suborder Stylonurina. Mycteropoids have been recovered from Europe, Russia, South America and South Africa. Mycteropoid specimens are often fragmentary, making it difficult to establish relationships between the included taxa. Only two mycteropoid taxa are known from reasonable complete remains, Hibbertopterus scouleri and H. wittebergensis.Jeram, Andrew J.; Selden, Paul A. (1993/01). \\"Eurypterids from the Vis√©an of East Kirkton, West Lothian, Scotland\\". Earth and Environmental Science Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. 84 (3-4): 301‚Äì308. doi:10.1017/S0263593300006118. ISSN 1755-6929. Mycteropoids were large bizarre Eurypterids found from the Early Silurian to the end of the Permian period. They were sweep feeders, inhabiting freshwater swamps and rivers, feeding by raking through the soft sediment with blades on their anterior appendages to capture small invertebrates. Their morphology was so unusual that they have been thought to be an order separate to Eurypterida. Recent work however confirms them to be derived members of the suborder Stylonurina, with the genus Drepanopterus being a basal member of their superfamily. The mycteropoids are important within eurypterid evolutionary history as the last group of eurypterids to experience a significant radiation in diversity at the genus level (during the Late Devonian and Carboniferous) as well as being the latest known surviving members of the group, going extinct during the Permian- Triassic extinction event.  Description  Reconstruction of Megarachne, a mycteroptid once thought to have been a giant spider. Mycteropoids are diagnosed as stylonurines with a posterior cleft on the metastoma and rounded lenses overlaying the lateral eyes as well as having anterior prosomal appendages modified for sweep-feeding. Sweep-feeding strategies evolved independently in two of the four stylonurine superfamilies, the Stylonuroidea and the Mycteropoidea. In both superfamilies, the adaptations to this lifestyle involves modifications to the spines on their anterior prosomal appendages for raking through the substrate of their habitats. Stylonuroids have fixed spines on appendages II-IV which could have been used as dragnets to rake through the sediments and thus entangling anything in their way. Mycteropoids show even more extreme adaptations towards a sweep-feeding lifestyle. They possess blades on prosomal appendages II-III (and IV within the Hibbertopteridae), highly distinct from flattened spines such as in the kokomopteroid Hallipterus, being laterally expanded with a blunt and rounded termination that has sensory setae. The tactile function of these might have allowed mycteropoids to select prey from the sediments in a way that stylonuroids could not. In the mycteroptids, appendages II and III were used for prey capture, whilst hibbertopterids also used appendage IV, while also retaining its use as a leg for walking. The coxae in Hibbertopterus are reduced, leading to part of the food masticatory process being assumed by the laden (plates overlaying the coxae). Some species of Hibbertopterus have even further adaptations towards sweep-feeding than other mycteropoids, with its blades modified into comb-like rachis that could entrap smaller prey or other organic food particles. With its coxae being large, it is likely that some species of Hibbertopterus would also feed on relatively large invertebrates when able to.  Systematics and genera  Fossil of Drepanopterus, the earliest known and most basal mycteropoid. Mycteropoids are so derived and unusual that their unique morphology on occasion has prompted researchers to place them as an order separate to Eurypterida. Recent research however resolve them as a sister group to Kokomopteroidea, united by a median ridge on the carapace between the lateral eyes and a distal thickening to the podomeres of the prosomal appendages, within the Stylonurina suborder of eurypterids. Drepanopterus, the only member of the family Drepanopteridae, was resolved as a sister taxon to all other mycteropoids and is also the earliest known member of the group, occurring from the Lower Silurian to the Upper Devonian. Drepanopterus also shares certain characteristics with the kokomopteroids (such as having a clavate telson) and other mycteropoids (a posteriorly cleft metastoma and having blades on the anterior prosomal appendages). Other mycteropoids are classified within one of two families, the Hibbertopteridae or the Mycteroptidae. The Hibbertopteridae and Mycteropidae are united by the possession of a hastate telson with paired ventral keels and a cuticular ornament consisting of scales or mucrones. It is worth noting that it is thought that several genera within the Mycteropoidea may represent different ontogenic stages. Though further work is required to either confirm or disprove such hypotheses, one example is the suggestion that almost all the members of the Mycteroptidae (Megarachne, Mycterops and Woodwardopterus) might represent ontogenic stages of a single genus, Mycterops.

This contrasts with the traditional method of having point solutions for each security function. UTM simplifies information-security management by providing a single management and reporting point for the security administrator rather than managing multiple products from different vendors. UTM appliances have been gaining popularity since 2009, partly because the all-in-one approach simplifies installation, configuration and maintenance. Such a setup saves time, money and people when compared to the management of multiple security systems. Instead of having several single-function appliances, all needing individual familiarity, attention and support, network administrators can centrally administer their security defenses from one computer. Some of the prominent UTM brands are Fortinet, Sophos, WiJungle, SonicWall and Check Point. Features UTMs at the minimum should have some converged security features like * Network firewall * Intrusion detection * Intrusion prevention Some of the other features commonly found in UTMs are: * Gateway anti-virus * Application layer (Layer 7) firewall and control * Deep packet inspection * Web proxy and content filtering *Email filtering * Data loss prevention (DLP) * Security information and event management (SIEM) * Virtual private network (VPN) * Network tarpit Disadvantages Although an UTM offers ease of management from a single device, it also introduces a single point of failure within the IT infrastructure. Additionally, the approach of a UTM may go against one of the basic information assurance / security approaches of defense in depth, as a UTM would replace multiple security products, and compromise at the UTM layer will break the entire defense-in-depth approach.

Flavin metamorphosis: cofactor transformation through prenylation. Current Opinion in Chemical Biology. 2018;47:117-25.. Following the elucidation of prFMN's structure in the active site of Fdc1 from aspergillus niger (AnFdc1) the prenyltrasferase activity of UbiX was investigated. Incubation of UbiX from P.aeruginosa with oxidised FMN and DMAP followed by reduction with sodium dithionite lead to the formation of prFMNreduced . The same procedure followed by re-oxidation under aerobic conditions lead to prFMNradical. Anaerobic incubation of apo-AnFdc1 with prFMNreduced followed by exposure to oxygen lead to decarboxylase activity, however incubation with prFMNradical did not afford activity to apo-AnFdc1. This suggests that the prFMNreduced form can be correctly oxidised by UbiD/Fdc1 to the corresponding prFMNiminium (Figure 2) . upright=1.6  UbiX Mechanism  P.aeruginosa UbiX (PaUbiX) crystal structures revealed the DMAP substrate is positioned directly above the FMN isoalloxazine ring and that the N5-C1‚Äô dimethylallyl adduct forms first as a prerequisite to formation of the C6-C3‚Äô bond and creation of the fourth non-aromatic ring (Figure.1) . Several conserved residues were found to be binding the DMAP phosphate group with the residue E140 suggested to act as a proton donor to enhance the phosphate leaving group. The study suggested that the two residues S15 and E49 play an important role in N5 deprotonation and N5-C1‚Äô bond formation (Figure 1), the mutation E49Q severely affected PaUbiX‚Äôs ability to activate AnFdc1 and crystal structures of E49Q did not reveal a N5-C1‚Äô bond within 1-5 seconds following reduction and rapid freezing, in contrast to wild type (WT) PaUbiX for which the N5-C1‚Äô bond was observed within 1-5 seconds. This study was unable to trap any intermediates during formation of the C3‚Äô-C6 bond, but suggested C6 nucleophilic attack on the C3‚Äô carbocation occurs concomitant with or following protonation of the C2‚Äô via the bound phosphate. The resultant cyclohexadiene adduct was then postulated to form the final product via aromatisation concomitant with proton abstraction via S15 and E49. The mechanism suggested for PaUbiX is shown in Figure 1 . These findings were updated in 2019 with a new publication showing that the first step, the N5-C1' bond formation is likely to occur via an SN1 mechanism . This leads to the strict requirement for a substrate dimethylallyl moiety to initiate the reaction. The same paper showed that the N5 alkylation occurred whether it was a DMAP or DMAPP substrate in the DMAPP specific UbiX from aspergillus niger (AnUbiX), therefore this step is independent of the beta phosphate present in DMAPP . In the same AnUbiX enzyme they showed that the Fridel-Crafts alkylation of the flavin C6 only occurs using the DMAPP substrate. Mutations to the phosphate binding site of PaUbiX were also unable to form the C6-C3' bond, but could be rescued through the addition of phosphate. This confirmed that UbiX catalyses the formation of the C6-C3' bond through phosphate (and pyrophosphate) acid-base catalysis .

Of the ecological transition on the eastern boundary Tindale writes:- > 'the eastern boundary of the Tjeraridjal, near Naretha, is strongly > emphasized by the change from sclerophyll forests of mallee and gimlet to > myall and bulloak which mark the transition to the vast karst treeless > plateau of the Nullarbor Plain.'

It is long and up to deep at its mouth at the town of Inabanga. Its name means \\"Rented River\\", from the root word abang which means \\"rent\\". Due to drownings and attacks by crocodiles (which used to inhabit the river), this loss of life was considered a rent for the use of the river. In May 2017, the Inabanga River was used by heavily armed members of Abu Sayyaf for a planned incursion into Bohol. Course Pilar Dam and reservoir Its sources, the Wahig and Pamacsalan Rivers, spring in the mountains of Sierra Bullones and flow into an irrigation reservoir behind the Pilar or Malinao Dam. From there the Inabanga River bisects Bohol before draining in the Cebu Strait in the north-western part of the island. The major tributaries are the Dagohoy, Danao, Wahig, and Pamacsalan Rivers. Other minor tributaries are the Mas-ing, Sagnap, and Malitbog Rivers. In 1905, the river was navigable up to for boats drawing 6 ft, and up to for rafts. The coastal plain is one to two miles wide where the river banks are muddy and fringed in many places by nipa mangroves, which are used by locals for nipa plantation and harvesting. Further upstream the surrounding hills rise steeply. The river's estuary is a productive habitat for invertebrates, fish, and birds, as well as spawning and nursery grounds for many species of fish, supports seagrass vegetation, shellfish beds, and nesting grounds for a variety of birds. The estuary is under threat from human development pressures such as fish pens, oyster farms, recreational use, and pollution. Watershed The Inabanga River watershed is and covers all or parts of 15 municipalities in Bohol. It is mostly characterized by flat to rolling terrain, while some 35% of the watershed is very steep terrain, rising to in Sierra Bullones. Land use is almost all farmland, with patches of grasslands, thickets and secondary forests. Forests cover only 14% of the basin. A small portion of it is protected in the Rajah Sikatuna Protected Landscape. The major subbasins are the Dagohoy River basin (area of ) and Danao River basin (area of ), as well as the Wahig and Pamacsalan basin (area of ). The annual average rainfall is ‚Äî in Pilar, in Dagohoy, and in Danao ‚Äî which is equally distributed throughout the year.

The Roof Runner¬Æ machine, manufactured in Sweden, was introduced by Butler Manufacturing for the MR-24¬Æ roof system. Progressive roller dies of the roof seamer are used to bend the metal roof panel seam into the desired shape to produce a finished seam profile. This shows a cross-section profile of the seam. A roof seamer is a portable roll forming machine that is used to install mechanically seamed structural standing seam metal roof panels, as part of an overall metal construction building envelope system. The machine is small and portable to be handled by an operator on top of a roof. The machine is applied to the overlapping area when two parallel roof panels meet. The action of the machine bends the two panels together to form a joint that has weather-tight qualities superior to other types of roof systems and cladding.  History  Commonly, a roof seamer is developed as an afterthought. Since roof seamers are dependent on the metal roof system being used, their development was secondary to the roof panel. A roof seamer is a development that replaced a manual process and hand tools of the past. A hammer and small anvil were tools that were used for hemming and seaming roof panels together at the edge where they meet with the next roof panel in sequence. In 1976, a German immigrant and inventor, Ewald Stellrecht, helped develop an early version of a metal roof panel portable roll forming machine in Exton, PA. From this a version of the roof seamer was also created. Since that time, great strides and innovations have been made in the development of roof seaming machines. Also, in the 1970s, Butler Manufacturing developed and released a proprietary roof system that featured the use of an electric roof seamer, dubbed the Roof Runner¬Æ, along with hand tools and an operating platform. Many developments have been made since that time to make roof seamers lighter, faster, and more user- friendly. In 1989, Developmental Industries refocused the niche market by developing a line of roof seamers that were universal to many different panel manufacturers' products and were available to rent by the end-user. Traditionally, purchasing a roof seamer meant that it would work with one specific roof panel, manufactured by a specific roof panel manufacturer. By opening up builders and installers to the option of renting, this allowed them to have the option of buying from different sources and greatly reducing their cost, making metal roofing a more accessible option for many that would not consider it before.  Design and Function  Today roof seamers are used around the world. As the rise in popularity in sustainable building products has risen in recent years, the need of a roof seaming tool has also increased. Most roof seaming machines can have a life expectancy of 20 or more years, if proper maintenance and care are exercised.  Variables  Many variables exist when using a roof seamer that may affect the final product outcome. All of the following variables should be considered and decided on during the design process of the building: * Material: Metal roof panels are made from a variety of materials including coated carbon steel, aluminum, zinc, and copper. The type and strength of the material must be considered, not only for tensile strength but also flexural strength. The quality of materials should be considered based on the mill and country it was sourced from. Most often these materials come to the panel manufacturer in the form of a coil, then fed into a roll forming machine to produce the finished roof panel shape and dimension. * Material Coating: A coating can be layers of other metals (such as Galvalume¬Æ or material treated through the process of galvanization), paint, or extruded coatings. * Thickness: Different gauges of metal will present a range of thicknesses that must be accounted for with the forming dies of the roof seaming machine. This, in addition to the thickness of the coating, should be factored in to produce an acceptable seamed profile, but not to compromise the coating. * Geography: The particular location of the structure will play into its performance over time. Weather patterns, temperature ranges, and prolonged exposure to the elements can affect the thermal movement of the metal roof panels. * Structural Load: Many things can produce \\"load\\" on a roof. The most common that will be combated by the roof seamer are considered environmental loads, such as wind, snow, rain, and seismic considerations. * Sealants: Sealants are almost always used inside of the panel lapped seams. These sealants can be applied in a factory setting or at the construction site. In either case, liquid caulk sealant and butyl tapes are the most common. In either case, the amount, location, and application method are specified to cause maximum protection for the building system as a whole.This shows an unseamed metal roof panel lap and two common options for a finished seam profile that a roof seamer can produce. * Desired results: The \\"finished seam profile\\" can be specified by a roof panel manufacturer as an option for the architectural designer to consider. Factors that can affect the desired results would be aesthetic appearance and environmental loads. * Roof Pitch: A roof's pitch is simply the angle of the roof. This will create resistance for the roof seamer to overcome. The steeper the pitch, the greater the roof seamer may have to work to ascend and descend the roof panels. * Fastening method: Mechanically seamed standing seam roof systems use a hidden fastener system. This system consists of a \\"clip\\" that is fabricated out of metal and attached to the structure's substrate with screws. When the panels are installed over these clips, they will be hidden from view and formed into the seam of the panels with the roof seamer. This prevents penetrations from fasteners and screws through the metal roof panel that would be used to secure them to the structure with other types of metal roofs. * Ancillary Attachments: Roof-mounted HVAC, solar panels, snow guards, and many other products are often attached to standing seam metal roofs. This additional load, attachment methods and the use of dissimilar materials must be considered. Specifically the use of other materials to prevent galvanic corrosion and premature compromise and degradation of the materials.  Power and usage  Traditionally, roof seamers are powered by electricity-driven motors. Depending on the operator's location, either 110-volt or 220-volt power may be required. On most construction sites, either temporary electrical power is supplied or power is offered by an electric generator. This gives the operator the flexibility to take the power source onto a roof with them instead of using extensions cords, which can depreciate the power supply and possibly damage the motor of the roof seamer.  Training  An operator monitors an electric roof seamer as it travels along a metal roof seam. While simple in concept, the effective use of the roof seamer requires a trained person to operate. Training is both practical and effective in on-site troubleshooting. While classroom and practical training are options to learn how to operate a roof seamer, on-the-job training is recommended as being the most effective method. Manuals, videos, and field guides are also methods that will support training. In all cases, training should be completed before operating alone with a roof seamer to teach proper preventive maintenance steps, simple adjustments and troubleshooting in the event of a machine problem. In 2015, the Metal Construction Association published a \\"best practices\\" guide for proper use and operation of roof seaming tools.  Maintenance  As with any tool, proper maintenance will increase the usefulness and life expectancy. Proper maintenance extends beyond the roof seamer, to the working surface on the roof. Before operating the roof seamer, ensure that the roof panel and seam are clean and clear of debris that could mark or gouge the forming dies. During operation check lubrication points and other recommended maintenance steps. In addition, most manufacturers will recommend scheduled service on an annual basis to ensure internal components are not worn or damaged.  Other tools  A hand crimper is used to flat- form the material ahead of a roof seamer or in place of roll forming in some applications. In conjunction with the roof seaming machine, there are an array of hand tools that are used. The most common tool that is usually required when operating a roof seamer is a \\"hand crimper\\". The hand crimper is used to \\"flat form\\" the panel seams into the appropriate configuration to prepare the seam for the roof seamer to be applied. Other common tools are snips, nibblers, and shears.  Support Organizations  There are numerous professional and trade organizations that support metal roofing, metal construction and the core market where roof seamers are used. The Metal Roofing Alliance (MRA), Metal Construction Association (MCA), Metal Buildings Manufacturers Association (MBMA), the Metal Buildings Contractors and Erectors Association (MBCEA), and the National Roofing Contractors Association (NRCA) are just a few. In addition, many distributors and suppliers offer resources and support documentation for their particular product offerings.

It states that an increased amount of evaporation or transpiration will cause a reduction in atmospheric pressure as clouds form, which will subsequently cause moist air to be drawn to regions where evaporation is at its highest. In a desert this will correspond to the sea whereas in a forest, moist air from the sea will be drawn inland. The theory predicts two different types of coast to contentinental rainfall patterns, first in a forested area one can expect no decrease in rainfall as one moves inland in contrast to a deforested region where one observes an exponential decrease in annual rainfall. Whereas it is true current global climate models fit these patterns as well, it is argued this is due to parametrization and not the veracity of the theories. This theory is in contradiction of the more traditional view that surface winds are solely a direct product of differences in surface heating and heat released from condensation. The creators of the theory argue that phase changes in water play a greater role in atmospheric dynamics than currently acknowledged. Publication of the paper was preceded by an extended editorial debate at the publishing journal, based on highly critical peer reviews.

Diphosphagermylenes are a class of compounds containing a divalent germanium atom bound to two phosphorus atoms. While these compounds resemble diamidocarbenes, such as N-heterocyclic carbenes (NHC), diphosphagermylenes display bonding characteristics distinct from those of diamidocarbenes. In contrast to NHC compounds, in which there is effective N-C p(œÄ)-p(œÄ) overlap between the lone pairs of planar nitrogens and an empty p-orbital of a carbene, systems containing P-Ge p(œÄ)-p(œÄ) overlap are rare. Until 2014, the geometry of phosphorus atoms in all previously reported diphosphatetrylenes are pyramidal, with minimal P-Ge p(œÄ)-p(œÄ) interaction. It has been suggested that the lack of p(œÄ)-p(œÄ) in Ge-P bonds is due to the high energetic barrier associated with achieving a planar configuration at phosphorus, which would allow for efficient p(œÄ)-p(œÄ) overlap between the phosphorus lone pair and the empty P orbital of Ge. The resulting lack of œÄ stabilization contributes to the difficulty associated with isolating diphosphagermylene and the Ge-P double bonds. However, utilization of sterically encumbering phosphorus centers has allowed for the isolation of diphosphagermylenes with a planar phosphorus center with a significant P-Ge p(œÄ)-p(œÄ) interaction.

Computational calculations (at the CIS level with the ab initio Los Alamos pseudopotential method (LAN L 1 DZ)) of the diphosphagermylene electronic structure was in agreement experimentally-derived electronic transition values. Due to disorder, the crystal structure of the diphosphagermylene could not be investigated. centerthumb550x550px Synthesis of monomeric œÉ-only diphosphagermylenes. Synthesis of P-Ge œÄ-Stabilized Diphosphagermylenes The sterically encumbered germylene ligand (Dipp)2PH, where Dipp=2,6-iPr2C6H3, was synthesized by the addition of PCl3 to DippLi-(OEt2), followed by the addition of LiAlH4. (Dipp)2PH was added to PhCH2K, which is combined with GeCl2 to provide (Dipp2P)2Ge. The synthesis resulted in dark red crystals suitable for x-ray crystallography. The identity of the compound was confirmed by elemental analysis, multinuclear NMR, and x-ray crystallography. This compound is stable in the absence of air and water. Synthesis of p(œÄ)-p(œÄ) stabilized diphosphagermylenes ((Dipp2P)2Ge). Structure and Bonding P-Ge œÉ-only system: Driess's diphosphagermylene  While crystals were formed of Driess's diphosphagermylene, the X-ray structure diphosphagermylene could not be analyzed due to disordering. It has been suggested that the three lone pairs in Driess's diphosphagermylene system are composed of Ge (4s, 4p) and P (3s, 3p) valence orbitals. Driess calculated (MP2/DZ+POL//RHF/DZ+ZPE) the reaction profile for the isomerization of E(PH2)2 (E = Si, Ge, Sn, Pb) from a œÉ-only, carbene-like system to a tautomer containing trivalent E with a œÄ bond between E and phosphorus. The authors observed that the carbene-like form is preferred over its tautomer for silicon, germanium, tin, and lead analogues. P-Ge p(œÄ)-p(œÄ) Stabilized Systems: ((Dipp)2P)2Ge and ((Tripp)2P)2Ge  P-substituted heavier group 14 analogues (Si, Ge, Sn, Pb) of diaminocarbenes are less established. It has been suggested this is due to a high energetic barrier associated with achieving a planar configuration at phosphorus, which would enable p(œÄ)-p(œÄ) overlap between the P lone pair and the empty p orbital of the group 14 center. Differences in donation ability of phosphorus versus nitrogen likely do not play a role in achieving p(œÄ)-p(œÄ) overlap because calculations indicate that the œÄ donor capacity of phosphorus is similar to that of nitrogen. Consequently, all P atoms in reports on diphosphatetrylenes previous to ((Dipp)2P)2Ge contain pyramidal P with Ge-P bonds of exclusively œÉ character. By utilizing sterically encumbered (Dipp)P ligands, p(œÄ)-p(œÄ) in diphosphagermylene was achieved. This compound crystallizes as discrete monomers and is the first crystallographically characterized diphosphagermylene with a two-coordinate Ge center. Ball and stick model with bond lengths and angles derived from the crystal structure of ((Dipp)2P)2Ge. By crystal structure analysis, the bond lengths of the two germanium- phosphorus bonds are 2.2337 √Ö (P1-Ge) and 2.3823 √Ö (P2-Ge). While the phosphorus center of P1-Ge is pyramidal, the P2-Ge phosphorus is trigonal planar. Moreover, the planes of P1-Ge-P2 and C-P1-Ge are nearly in coincident. These results are consistent with multiple bond character between a trigonal planar phosphorus (P1) and Ge. It has been suggested that only one P of the diphosphagermylene is planar because there is competition between the two phosphorus lone pairs and the empty P orbitals at the Ge center if both phosphorus atoms are planar. This would result in a weaker P-Ge interaction that would not be sufficient to overcome the energy of planarizing both P atoms. In addition, ((Dipp)2P)2Ge was modified such that an iPr groups was added to the para position of (Dipp)2P, to make (Tripp)2P. The donating effect of an additional iPr group has little effect on the bonding and structure of the diphosphagermylene. =Solution and Solid State Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR)= A single, broad singlet is observed at 3.2 ppm at room temperature in the solution state phosphorus nuclear magnetic resonance (PNMR) of ((Dipp)2P)2Ge. This signal is consistent with rapid exchange between the planar and pyramidal phosphorus centers. As the temperature is reduced to -80 C, the signal becomes two broad, equal intensity singlets at -42.0 ppm and 8.0. Two peaks with isotropic chemical shifts of 81.9 and -61.6 ppm, in a 1:1 ratio are observed in the solid state PNMR. No other signals are observed in the PNMR. In general diphosphagermylenes with pyramidal phosphorus centers exhibit a chemical shift close to those of free phosphine. In addition, planar phosphorus centers of GeIV=P compounds generally have a downfield PNMR shift. Consequently, peaks at 81.9 and -61.6 ppm have been assigned as planar and pyramidal phosphorus centers of ((Dipp)2P)2Ge, respectively. This has been supported by DFT calculations that predict PNMR shifts of planar and pyramidal phosphorus centers of ((Dipp)2P)2Ge are at 100 and -61 ppm. =Natural Bond Orbital (NBO) Analysis= Natural bond orbital analysis has been carried out on the P-Ge p(œÄ)-p(œÄ) system, ((Dipp)2P)2Ge. Inspection of the molecular orbitals reveals that the HOMO-1 consists of a œÄ orbital, resulting from donation from the planar P lone pair into the empty P orbital of the germylene center. Natural bond orbital analysis reveals that this bond is 77% P-based and 0.3 eV higher in energy than the P-Ge œÉ bond. In contrast, the lone pair of the pyramidal phosphorus center is essentially sp hybridized and directed away from the germanium center. The germanium lone pair is predominantly s-character. Wiberg bond indices for Ge-P1 and Ge-P2 bonds are 1.33 and 0.89, respectively, which is consistent with a double bond between Ge-P1 and a single bond between Ge-P2. =Atoms in Molecules (AIM) Analysis = AIM analysis of ((Dipp)2P)2Ge suggests that there is a double bond between P1-Ge. Bond order can be assessed by measuring the ellipticity, a measure of anisotropic electron density, at the bond critical point. For example, butane, ethylene, and ethyne have a bond ellipticity of 0.01, 0.30, and 0.00 respectively, which correspond to a single, double, and a triple bond. A bond critical point between P1-Ge with œÅ=0.091 and ellipticity 0.297 was observed in ((Dipp)2P)2Ge, consistent with a double bond. . This contrasts œÅ=0.083 and ellipticity 0.064 at the bond critical point of P2-Ge in ((Dipp)2P)2Ge. Delocalization index (DI) was also used to predict the bond order of ((Dipp)2P)2Ge. DI values for P1-Ge and P2-Ge were determined to be 1.275 and 0.843, consistent with a P1-Ge double bond and Wiberg bond indices calculated.

Sugar is heavily marketed both by sugar producers and the producers of sugary drinks and foods. Apart from direct marketing methods such as messaging on packaging, television ads, advergames, and product placement in setting like blogs, industry has worked to steer coverage of sugar-related health information in popular media, including news media and social media. Sugar refiners and manufacturers of sugary foods and drinks have also sought to influence medical research and public health recommendations, The results of research on the health effects of sugary food and drink differ significantly, depending on whether the researcher has financial ties to the food and drink industry. The authors of a 2016 review of funding bias concluded that \\"This industry seems to be manipulating contemporary scientific processes to create controversy and advance their business interests at the expense of the public's health\\".  History  In the early 1950s, sugar was marketed as a healthy substance that would help curb hunger and provide an energy boost. More recent methods are necessarily less direct. Methods of marketing sugary products include: * marketing high- sugar versions of established low-sugar brands as flavour variations * using words associated with health, such as \\"healthy\\", \\"natural\\", \\"naturally sweetened\\" and \\"lightly sweetened\\" * using associations with fruit to imply healthiness * shill advertising, through front groups and individuals with no obvious connection to the sugar industry, including people presenting themselves as independent scientists * targeting women, who make many food purchasing decisions * targeting children; below age seven, they have difficulty recognizing persuasive intent, and below the age of twelve, they are more easily distracted from it than adults. Almost a quarter of food industry advertising money is spend on advertising to children * positioning sugary drinks and foods as a freedom-of-choice issue rather than a public health one Influence on health information and guidelines Sugar refiners and manufacturers of sugary foods and drinks have sought to influence medical research and public health recommendations, with substantial spending documented from the 1960s to 2016. The results of research on the health effects of sugary food and drink differ significantly, depending on whether the researcher has financial ties to the food and drink industry. The authors of a 2016 review of funding bias concluded that \\"This industry seems to be manipulating contemporary scientific processes to create controversy and advance their business interests at the expense of the public's health\\". A 2013 review concluded that \\"unhealthy commodity industries should have no role in the formation of national or international NCD [non-communicable disease] policy\\". There have been similar efforts to steer coverage of sugar-related health information in popular media, including news media and social media. The Sugar Research Foundation, a trade association for the sugar industry, conceived, funded, and participated in an influential 1967 medical review. It was called \\"SRF Funds Project 226\\", and published as \\"Dietary Fats, Carbohydrates and Atherosclerotic Vascular Disease\\". While this took place in 1965‚Äì1967, it was documented in a 2016 JAMA Internal Medicine publication which reviewed industry documents. Among the researchers who put their names to the 1967 review, David Mark Hegsted went on to write national nutrition guidelines, and Fredrick J. Stare was head of Harvard University's nutrition department. Rules surrounding conflicts of interest in academic publishing were laxer then, helping the payment to go undeclared. Taking into account \\"other recent analyses of sugar industry documents\\", the 2016 review concludes that such actions were part of a wider industry-sponsored research program in the 1960s and 1970s. It also concludes that \\"Policymaking committees should consider giving less weight to food industry‚Äìfunded studies\\". Immediately afterwards, the same Sugar Research Foundation funded a study comparing sugar- fed and starch-fed rats. \\"SRF Funds Project 259: Dietary Carbohydrate and Blood Lipids in Germ-Free Rats\\" was funded from 1967 until 1971, when, after reporting preliminary results to the funders, it did not have its funding renewed. The research was never published. The U.S. National Institute of Dental Research's 1971 National Caries Program was lobbied by the sugar industry, which substantially influenced the types of research the caries program called for. Research on food cariogenicity that could have harmed the sugar industry was omitted from funding priorities. The NIDR's public health task force on caries and an industry task force on caries had almost exactly the same members. The NIDR copied 78% of the industry groups' report into their own, with portions being copied verbatim. After the WHO recommended cutting sugar consumption to less than 10% of daily energy intake in 1990, the International Life Sciences Institute gained accreditation as a research organization the WHO and FAO. The institute was founded by parties including Coca-Cola, PepsiCo and General Foods. Phillip James, head of the International Obesity Taskforce, considered that this accreditation increased industry influence over world health guidelines. The development of official European dietary guidelines was influenced by European sugar industry groups, who in 2000 threatened to block the report if a recommendation to limit sugar consumption to less than 10% of daily energy intake were not removed. The medical experts felt forced change the recommendation, to one that sugar should not be eaten more than four times a day. Industry groups also criticized the evidence behind the World Health Organization 2003 recommended limit on free sugar consumption (again, to less than 10% of daily energy intake). The US sugar industry additionally lobbied the US Congress to cut funding to the WHO. When the WHO updated the recommendations, a decade later in 2013, it commissioned two reviews, and found support for both the earlier recommendation and a new, stricter one, half as high as the old limit. This also met with industry opposition. The WHO began requiring anyone submitting formal comments on the proposal to fill out a conflict-of-interest form. In 2011, the competing Corn Refiners Association (which makes sugar syrups) and the Sugar Association became involved in a lawsuit against one another, which continued as of 2015. In the course of this lawsuit, numerous internal documents were made public. These revealed funding of over $10 million to James Rippe for health research and media outreach, and a combined $4 million to Citizens for Health and Center for Consumer Freedom, which publicly opposed one another's views on the healthiness of the rival products without acknowledging their funding (such shilling is legal in the US following the Citizens United ruling). In 2015, it was reported that Coca-Cola had paid millions to promote controversial health messages related to sweet drinks, ranging from academic research to social media posts, since 2008. The money went to researchers, dietitians, health experts, research organizations, and professional associations, among others. Following this media attention, Coca- Cola released information on almost $120 million U.S. dollars given out to medical, health and community organizations between 2010 and 2015. These include $29 million for academic research; the largest donation was $7.5 million to Louisiana State University's Pennington Biomedical Research Center. Coca-Cola has now announced that it will \\"pull back\\" (reporter's phrasing) from funding health experts and obesity research, in order to improve its transparency. A 2016 investigation of PepsiCo and Coca-Cola sponsorship and lobbying found funding going to \\"63 public health groups, 19 medical organizations, seven health foundations, five government groups and two food supply groups\\", including the National Institutes of Health, the American Diabetes Association, and professional associations of medical specialists. They found evidence that PepsiCo had funded 14% of the organizations, and Coca-Cola had funded 99%. However, the authors suspect this difference is overestimated; Coca-Cola had recently released some funding data (see previous paragraph), while, they say, PepsiCo is ‚Äúknown for making its sponsorship data extremely difficult to track‚Äù.  Labelling  Sugar is added to ingredients lists under dozens of different names, which, where ingredients lists are in order from largest to smallest quantity, can let sugars appear spuriously lower on the ingredients list. 2016 US nutritional labelling changes In 2016, the FDA enacted new requirements for US nutrition labels, which include calorie count in larger type and a separate line for added sugars. By July 2018 most manufacturers will need to use the new label. The new FDA requirements were initially proposed in 2014, they met with strong opposition from sugar and sugary food producers. Industry claimed the new rule lacked any scientific justification. Many specific companies also wrote letters requesting certain products to be exempt from the rule. The head of Ocean Spray Cranberries wrote a letter to the FDA explaining that cranberries without sugar are \\"unpalatable\\" and claimed that they needed to be an exception to the bill. The American Beverage Association wanted the measurement on the back of their labels to be in grams instead of teaspoons, saying that teaspoon measurements would carry a negative connotation that misrepresents the factual nature of nutritional information. The changes had bipartisan support; George W. Bush supported the FDA in its request for the legislation, and, after it was enacted under Barack Obama, said that the government had \\"got this right\\".  Campaigns to lower sugar consumption  A community campaign in Howard County, Maryland used the media to influence the attitudes and behaviors about the relationship between sugary drinks and obesity. The \\"Howard County Unsweetened\\" campaign used social media, television ads, in-person marketing, and community organizations to encourage people to drink less sugary drinks, and promoted water as a substitute. This campaign was modeled after a study done in Portland, Oregon that found community based interventions were successful in influencing consumers likelihood of purchasing sugary drinks in supermarkets. Researchers associated sugary drinks with obesity, heart disease, and diabetes to influence the attitudes of the consumers and the purchasing behaviors of consumers. Sugar taxes Sugar taxes have been used to reduce the consumption of sugary drinks, often in combination with public information campaigns. A 2010 study of a sugar taxes in the US found that they decreased consumption of taxed drinks, but increased the consumption of untaxed high-calorie drinks, removing the benefit. In Mexico, sugary drink consumption dropped after a public health campaign including a sugar tax came in in 2014, and dropped further a year later. A 2015 tax in Berkeley, California had a similar effect, although overall grocery spending did not decline. In 2016, the far larger city of Philadelphia brought in a sugar tax to fund children's programs.

Regular season play continued through June 16, 2018, while post-season play ran from July 11‚Äì28, 2018. The London Spitfire won the Grand Finals over the Philadelphia Fusion to become the League champions, with the Spitfire's Park \\"Profit\\" Jun-young named the Finals MVP. An All-Star Weekend was held following the post-season from August 25‚Äì26, 2018. Schedule The season's format and schedule were announced in November 2017. The inaugural regular season ran from January 10 to June 17, 2018, broken out into four stages. Each stage lasted five weeks, with a one-week break between each stages. Each regular season week featured twelve games, three matches per day from Wednesday to Saturday, with each team having played in two games that week. During stages one and two of season one, at the end of each stage, the top three teams across both divisions, based on their standings in that stage, played a final set of matches to win a prize with the runner-up taking a prize. As of season one stage three, four teams made each stage playoff. The #1 seed chose their opponent in the first round between the remaining three qualified teams. These matches are played on the final day of the stage. The season's free agency signing window opened on January 22, 2018, and closed on April 3, 2018 (the start of Stage 3). During this period, teams could sign any eligible free agent player or make trades with other teams. Any player on a new team contract before the start of Stage 2 on February 21, 2018 was eligible to play during Stage 2. Otherwise, they had to wait until the start of Stage 3. After April 3, team rosters could not be changed until after the completion of the post-season games. The post-season playoffs were held over three weeks in July 2018. It was a single-elimination playoff featuring 6 teams: each division leader, and the next top four teams from both divisions, with their position seeded by their standings. The Grand Finals were held on July 26 and 27, 2018. All matches in the inaugural season (except for the Grand Finals) were played at the 350-seat Blizzard Arena, located on the former soundstage for The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson in Burbank, California. Games were broadcast on the Overwatch League's website and through Major League Gaming (owned by Blizzard), and by third-party broadcaster Twitch. The Grand Finals were played at Barclays Center in New York City, where all 11,000 seats available were sold out for both days of the event. Pre-season Pre-season matches were held from December 6 to 8, 2017. Pre- season matches are exhibition only, and do not count towards the regular season standings. The Philadelphia Fusion had to pull out of pre-season play just before these events, citing \\"player logistics issues\\".  Broadcast and viewership  The Overwatch League began the season with a two-year exclusive contract for Overwatch League broadcasting. Its debut week held an overall peak of 441,000 concurrent viewers on its three Twitch channels, with 392,000 English, 65,000 Korean, and 11,500 French viewers. Through the season, average online viewership ran between 80,000 and 170,000. At least 310,000 viewers watched the final match of the Grand Finals. On the first day of the season playoffs, Disney and Blizzard announced a multi-year partnership that would bring the league and other professional Overwatch competitive events to ESPN, Disney XD, and ABC, starting with the playoffs and throughout all of the following season. Nielsen ratings for the Grand Finals include a 0.18 rating (approximately 218,000 households) for the Friday match airing on ESPN, while the recap of the series airing on ABC on the Sunday after the event had a 0.3 rating (approximately 359,000 households). Blizzard estimated that over a million people were watching the Grand Finals at any time, between broadcast and streaming formats, with a total viewership of over 10.8 million. Regular season A team's standing is based on both their overall match win/loss record, with ties broken by their overall round record. At the end of Stages 1 and 2, the top three teams overall in the current stage, regardless of division, made the stage playoffs. The first seeded team earned a bye, with the second and third seeded teams playing a best-of-5 series to advance to the stage finals. Beginning with Stage 3 of the 2018 season, Blizzard announced changes to the Stage Playoff format. Introduced was a four-team Stage playoffs going forward, so that both teams in the final match will have played the same number of games on that day. The first seed has the option of selecting their opponent for the first round and has home team advantage, with the remaining two teams assigned based on seed ranking. These stage playoffs have no effect on overall standings and are only for bonus prize money. Teams' overall standings were used for placement in the post-season playoffs. The top team of each division received an automatic bye, while the next top four teams, regardless of division, filled in the remaining tournament slots. Overall standings Stage 1 Stage 1 ran from January 10, 2018 to February 10, 2018, with Stage playoffs occurring on February 10, 2018. Source: Overwatch League =Playoffs= With a league best 9‚Äì1 stage record, the New York Excelsior earned a bye directly into the stage finals. In the semifinal match, the Houston Outlaws took an early 1‚Äì0 lead over the London Spitfire, but were ultimately defeated 3‚Äì1. In the stage final, the New York Excelsior took a commanding 2‚Äì0 lead over the Spitfire, but New York could not secure their third match win. The London Spitfire completed a reverse sweep, winning the series 3‚Äì2 and their first stage title. Stage 2 Stage 2 ran from February 21 to March 24. Following Stage 1, Blizzard took input from players and fans and moved all future Stage playoff matches to Sunday, with Stage 2's playoffs taking place on March 25. This avoided a twelve-hour day of matches, which could see a team playing as many as three different matches in the same day. Stage two introduced the Overwatch patch that weakened Mercy's resurrection abilities, which outside of League play had caused her to be played less frequently. Source: Overwatch League =Playoffs= The New York Excelsior finished with the best stage record again, earning another bye into the stage finals. The semifinal match featured the London Spitfire, looking to repeat on their Stage 1 championship, against the Philadelphia Fusion. The Fusion won the series, 3‚Äì2. In the finals, the Fusion took 2‚Äì0 lead over the Excelsior, though New York came back and completed a reverse sweep to win the series and their first stage title. Stage 3 Stage 3 ran from April 4 to May 5, with the stage playoffs occurring on May 6. This stage introduced a four-team stage playoffs format so both teams in the final match will have played the same number of games on that day. The first seed was given the option of selecting their opponent for the first round and received home team advantage, with the remaining two teams assigned based on seed ranking. Stage 3 introduced the Hybrid map \\"Blizzard World,\\" which was released in November 2017, to the map pool. Stage 3 also introduced the patch that buffed Sombra's abilities, making her a more frequent component in winning team combinations. Source: Overwatch League =Playoffs= Following the conclusion of Stage 3, the top seeded Boston Uprising became the first team in Overwatch League history to go undefeated in a stage. As the top seed, they earned the right to choose their first round opponent for the stage playoffs. They chose the fourth seed Los Angeles Gladiators, achieving a 3‚Äì0 match win. The second seed New York Excelsior also defeated the Los Angeles Valiant with a 3‚Äì0 win. The Excelsior won the final match over the Uprising in a 3‚Äì0 victory, marking their second stage championship win. Stage 4 Stage 4 ran from May 16 to June 16, with the Stage playoffs occurring on June 17. Teams competed using the version of Overwatch which first introduced the support hero Brigitte, but prior to a patch that adjusted her strength and which introduced a revamped skill kit for Hanzo. The decision to play on the former patch was made due to a bug in the later patch that could not be fixed before the start of Stage 4. Source: Overwatch League =Playoffs= After the group stage, the Los Angeles Gladiators finished atop the league via a map differential tiebreaker. They earned the right to choose their opponent for the first round of the playoffs. For the first time in this selection process, the team with the best record did not choose the lowest ranked team. They choose their crosstown rivals, the second-seeded Los Angeles Valiant. The Valiant won the series in 5 maps. In the next series, the two-time stage champion New York Excelsior defeated the Dallas Fuel, 3‚Äì2. The Excelsior were unable to win their third consecutive stage championship, losing to the Valiant, 3‚Äì1. Playoffs After the regular season, the New York Excelsior and the Los Angeles Valiant finished atop their respective divisions, earning first-round byes. The next four remaining teams, Boston Uprising, Los Angeles Gladiators, London Spitfire, and Philadelphia Fusion, were seeded according to regular season record, regardless of division. The third-seeded Uprising played the sixth- seeded Fusion, while the fourth-seeded Gladiators played the fifth-seeded Spitfire. Each series was a best of 3 matches (each match was best of 5 maps). The winners of the two semifinal matches advanced to the Grand Finals, which took place at Barclays Center in Brooklyn, New York from July 27‚Äì28.

Early life and career Gill was born in London to a schoolmaster and former nurse; the family lived in Camden Town. Her parents had met at Craiglockhart, near Edinburgh, where her mother was then working, the building being used as a military psychiatric hospital for World War I shell-shock patients like her father. Like her elder sister, Hazel, Gill was educated at St Paul's Girls' School. In 1948, Gill began working for the BBC as a secretary (her sister had joined the corporation three years earlier), initially working for women's radio programmes, then at Alexandra Palace along with her sister. She worked for the producers Dorothea Brooking and Joy Harington, both involved in creating children's drama productions. Later, from 1955, she was an assistant floor manager. Blue Peter and Swap Shop In this period, she first met Edward Barnes, who later managed to gain her secondment to Blue Peter when the producer (later programme editor) Biddy Baxter was called for jury service in 1963. Owen Reed, then head of the children's department was persuaded Gill could remain on the production team for a short period; she remained for another 13 years. The team of Baxter, Barnes and Gill established the programme's reputation; the later two became producers when the programme became bi-weekly in 1964. Gill became deputy editor when Barnes was appointed deputy head of the children's department. In 1976, Gill left Blue Peter to become the editor of Multi- Coloured Swap Shop, more commonly known as Swap Shop. A newly created unrehearsed three-hour Saturday morning programme presented by Noel Edmonds, then best known as a disc-jockey for BBC Radio 1, the programme was a great success, despite initial doubts from some within the BBC. The series, based around children exchanging their possessions, replaced the previous BBC Saturday morning offering of repeats. \\"We wanted a programme that absolutely anybody could join in. As long as they had something, either goods and chattels, ideas or simply chat, to exchange\\", Gill remembered. \\"I don't believe she [Gill] had an ego,\\" Edmonds recalled. \\"Rose was the silent shadow drifting behind the cameras, stepping over cables and whispering words of encouragement to a studio crew who all knew that in Swap Shop we were creating something very special\\". When Swap Shop ended in 1982, Edmonds wishing to concentrate on his career in primetime television, Gill remembered that during her childhood, she had enjoyed playing shop with her sister. Saturday Superstore, now with Mike Read as the main presenter, based around an imaginary department store, was the new Saturday morning children's programme. It did not match the public reception of its predecessor, although it was welcomed by BBC management. Gill took early retirement in 1983. Private life Gill was engaged in the late 1940s to a submariner serving in the Royal Navy, but her fianc√© died in a submarine accident. Gill's sister, Hazel, who had managed Blue Peter extensive correspondence, also retired early, and the two sisters travelled extensively in Europe and North America until Hazel died of cancer in 2001. Rosemary Gill died in February 2011, aged 80.

She also undertook extensive work as a literary translator from Turkish to German. Gisela Kraft formed her own judgements and lived by them. One adjective that repeatedly appears in sources describing her is \\"idiosyncratic\\".  Life  Gisela Kraft was born in Berlin, where she grew up during the war years. Between 1956 and 1959 she undertook a training in Theatre and Eurythmy in Berlin, Stuttgart and Dornach. Between 1960 and 1972 she engaged in a succession of theatre jobs. An abrupt change came in 1972 when she enrolled at the Free University in West Berlin and embarked on a degree course in Islamic studies. Six years later, in 1978, she received her doctorate with a dissertation (subsequently published) on the Turkish poet Fazƒ±l H√ºsn√º Daƒülarca. She stayed on at the Free University as an academic researcher at the Institute for Islamic studies from 1978 till 1983. During the early 1980s Kraft was chair of the \\"Neue Gesellschaft f√ºr Literatur\\" (\\"New Society for Literature\\") in West Berlin which she co-founded. She was also actively involved, within the wider Peace movement, in the \\"Artists for Peace\\" (\\"K√ºnstler f√ºr den Frieden\\") initiative. A committed socialist, in November 1984 Kraft relocated from the west to East Berlin. In the west she had found herself under attack from Turkish leftwing intellectuals because she had dared to translate N√¢zƒ±m Hikmet's Bedreddin Epic. In the east she was offered a permanent translating job with a major publisher. It was unusual for West Germans to emigrate permanently to East Germany at this time: in a posthumously published memoir entitled \\"Mein Land, ein anderes\\" (loosely \\"My country, a different way\\") Kraft would recall in comic detail the difficulty the East German frontier official checking her papers had in accepting that she had no plans to \\"return home\\" to the west. She lived, sometimes critical but generally happily in the German Democratic Republic (East Germany) for the next six years. In the east she was able to support herself as a poet in a way that would have been more difficult or impossible in the west, and she quickly developed a network of close friends, although perhaps her most constant companion during this period was her overindulged cat, Sofia (\\"S√∂fchen\\"), a present from the poet Hinnerk Einhorn after the death of her \\"western\\" cat, Leila, shortly after the crossing to the east : one of the most important services a friend could provide was to look after the cat when Kraft had to be away from home overnight for a poetry reading. She also developed a deep affection for and knowledge of Sorbian language and literary culture. Some years after the changes which led to reunification, she relocated to Weimar which she had known when she was a child because it was where her grandmother lived, and where from 1997 she lived out the rest of her life. At the end Gisela Kraft fell ill with cancer. She refused conventional medical treatment and suffered a long decline, dying in the arms of her favourite sister, Reinhild, at a clinic in Bad Berka, near her Weimar home.  Works  In her poetry and in her prose works Gisela Kraft treated her impression of her travels in the Near East and her scholarly research of Turkish culture. From this she emerged as a literary translator from Turkish. She received the Weimar Prize for this in 2006. In 2009 she was awarded the Christoph Martin Wieland Translator Prize for her epilogue to N√¢zƒ±m Hikmet's \\"Die Namen der Sehnsucht\\" (\\"The Names of Yearning\\").

After recruitment, he was directed to intelligence training. He participated in the practical comprehensive training \\"Zarys 73\\", covering the operation of AWO in the urbanized area. During the exercise he was a radio telegraphist. Over the following years he performed supplementary tasks. During foreign trips he collected information about a given country, including passport control procedures. Eventually, he was reclassified to so-called conspiratorial telephone (he mediated or potentially mediated in contacts between the AWO officer and his chosen agent). He resigned in 1989. In the years 1989-1997 he held the mandate of a deputy to the Sejm, he belonged to the Social Democracy of the Republic of Poland. The grave of Ireneusz Seku≈Ça From December 1993 to March 1995 he was the president of the Central Customs Office. At that time, the prosecutor's office was conducting an investigation related to his interests in \\" Polnippona.\\" The first attempt to waive the immunity in June 1995 at the request of the Prosecutor-General W≈Çodzimierz Cimoszewicz was unsuccessful, against SLD and the Polish People's Party. Ultimately, his immunity was lifted in November 1996 and the applicant himself supported the request. In February 1998 the Wroc≈Çaw prosecutor's office accused him of committing four crimes, including for acting to the detriment of the Central Customs Office and the \\"Polnippon\\" company, of which he was the president. In the parliamentary elections in 1997, the Democratic Left Alliance did not put it on its lists. On the night of 22/23 March 2000, he was found unconscious in his office in Warsaw. In severe condition, he was taken to the hospital of the Ministry of National Defense, where he died on 29 April. He was buried in the cemetery in Wilan√≥w.

The identity of the woman in the sculpture Dama col mazzolino, at Bargello Museum in Florence could be attributed to Lucrezia Donati. Also Sandro Botticelli's painting Fortitude would be another representation of her.  Biography  Lucrezia was the daughter of Manno Donati and Caterina Bardi, a Florentine dame who belonged to an extinct family tree, being the last descendant. From 1461 was the mistress of Lorenzo il Magnifico, a platonic love, until Lorenzo later married the Italian noble Clarice Orsini.

Their second son, Stormont Murray, became a physician who practiced in London. Medical career The former British Lying-In Hospital, Endell Street, London. Murray enrolled in the medical school of King's College, London, when Arthur Farre was professor of obstetrics and became a member of the Royal College of Surgeons in 1856. He studied at the Vienna General Lying-in Hospital where puerperal fever had been tackled by Ignaz Semmelweis. Subsequently, he received his M.D. from the University of Edinburgh in 1860 for a thesis titled \\"On the Medico-Legal aspect of certain morbid conditions that may be mistaken for pregnancy\\". In 1858, Murray claimed, in a paper in The Lancet, to be able to tell the exact parts of a fetus, including each vertebra and the cleft between the buttocks, through feeling the abdomen of the pregnant woman. At the time, these women would have been examined only at labour and to be able to distinguish fetal parts during the antenatal period was felt to be unbelievable. His work was recognised by Adolphe Pinard, an eminent obstetrician and pioneer of listening to the fetal heartbeat, in Pinard's 1889 book on abdominal palpation in pregnancy, but his innovations in the examination of pregnant women were ignored in England. At the start of his career he had consulting rooms at his home at 17 Green Street, Mayfair, a fashionable location for doctors. He was physician-accoucheur and physician for the diseases of women and children to the St George's and St James's Dispensary. He was physician and later consulting physician-accoucheur to the St Pancras Provident Dispensary and was closely associated with the Establishment for Gentlewomen in Harley Street. He was also obstetric physician to the British Lying-In Hospital in Endell Street, London, where he was a governor, and then to the Great Northern Central Hospital, Caledonian Road, Islington.\\"Notes\\".

Oil-on-canvas, Tate Gallery, London. Murray's professional demeanor may have been the inspiration for the attentive and concerned physician in Luke Fildes' painting The Doctor (1891) after he attended the artist's first child, Philip, when he became ill and died at Christmas 1877. Murray and Fildes were well known to each other and Murray had delivered all the Fildes children. The artist's son, also Luke Fildes, wrote in his biography of his father: \\"The character and bearing of their doctor throughout the time of their anxiety, made a deep impression on my parents. Dr Murray became a symbol of professional devotion which would one day inspire the painting of The Doctor.\\" And: \\"The Doctor had been on my father's mind ever since Dr Murray watched over Philip\\". Fildes junior made it clear in his book, however, that the figure in the painting was a composite of several people, including Fildes' friend Dr Thomas Buzzard. Death Murray died on 7 August 1887 at 66 Great Cumberland Place, London, after becoming weak with stomach and liver problems. His death has been attributed to heart failure.\\"Obituary Gustavus C. P.

It was based on a Nieuport 80. Design and development Stefan Malinowski's several aircraft designs were all named Stemal, the first syllables of his names joined together. The Stemal III was a test-bed for his ideas for extending the speed range of aircraft using variable camber wings, which he had begun to develop at the beginning of World War I whilst studying the Gustave Eiffel wind tunnel results on the lift generated by cambered aerofoil sections. His first experiments were with a modified Caudron wing but the external mechanism he used increased the drag unacceptably. Instead, he developed a wing with ribs which were flexible aft of the main, forward, spar together with an internal, rear spar, cam-based mechanism to bend them. Malinkowski then took the device though aerodynamic tests in wind tunnels in Italy and made some initial practical tests with Ansaldo in Turin, all with encouraging results. The first full scale wing panel for structural and operational tests was built in 1921 at Bydgoszcz, in the workshops of the military flying school there. As a result Malinkowski obtained support from the Department of Aerial Navigation to build and fly a complete wing. The test aircraft was originally built as a Nieuport 80 biplane, a two seat trainer variant of the Nieuport 12 fighter aircraft. With its wings and the rear cockpit removed and with a new empennage, it was converted to a parasol wing monoplane. The Malinowski wing was held over the fuselage on each side with two outward-leaning inverted V-struts from the upper fuselage to front and rear spars and wire-braced above from a strut pyramid above the wing centre and below with wires from the lower fuselage longerons. The camber changes were confined to the central part of the wing so that the ailerons were unaffected. Piloted by Jerzy Kossowski, the Stemal III flew for the first time in late August 1922. The subsequent trials yielded promising results, with take-off and landing distances halved, rate of climb increased by 33% and service ceiling by 20%. Its stalling speed was reduced from without camber to with camber and its speed range, about 1:3.4, was much better than that of any of its contemporaries. These tests generated some interest, particularly at the Technical Services of Aerodynamics (S.T.A√®) in Paris in 1924, leading to studies by Hanriot of a similar wing. In 1925 the Warsaw Technical University made air-tunnel measurements on a wing with a greater camber range over its full span, controlled with a simplified mechanism. Apart from the Stemal III, the only other aircraft to incorporate the variable-camber wing was Malinowski's Dziaba, a highly ambitious flying wing glider. This should have competed in the Second Polish Glider Contest, held in August 1923. It attended but was badly damaged in the run-up to its first launch and though it was repaired before the end of the competition a lack of wind kept it on the ground. Funding problems limited any further wing development by Malinowski and although he sold his patents in November 1925, nothing more was made of them.

Background In February 1888 the voters of Dundee had gone to the polls to elect a replacement for Charles Carmichael Lacaita, one of the two members elected for Dundee in the 1886 general election, who had resigned from Parliament due to his disapproval of Gladstone's Home Rule policy. The winner of this contest was the Liberal Joseph Bottomley Firth. However Firth died in September 1889. Election Shortly after Firth's death speculation started has to who would contest the vacant seat, with the Glasgow Herald reporting ex-Bailie Robertson was expected to be offered the Liberal nomination, with Mr Dalglish and Mr W. L. Boase thought to be possible Unionist candidates. John Burns was also speculated upon as a possible Socialist candidate. Four local Liberals, including John Leng, reportedly declined nomination as a candidate, but Leng eventually agreed to stand. John Leng had come to Dundee in 1851 to edit and manageThe Dundee Advertiser, which he turned into a daily newspaper. He also founded The People's Journal, The Evening Telegraph and The People's Friend. The Glasgow Herald considered Leng to be a 'strong candidate', but thought that the Dundee Unionists had a chance of defeating him if they selected 'candidate of great local weight'. Ultimately there was no contest and Leng was returned without opposition, the first time the Dundee seat had not been contested since Sir John Ogilvy was returned unopposed at the 1865 general election, when Dundee was still a one-member seat. Leng was a supporter of Irish Home Rule and also supported Home Rule for Scotland, chairing a meeting of the Scottish Home Rule Association on the evening of his election. The Glasgow Herald described him as a strong supporter of Gladstone and considered Dundee 'fortunate' to have him as an MP.

Early life James Britton (J.B.) Ware was born to John Mims Ware and Lucy Sturdivant, and his father died when he was 8 years old. On October 11, 1849, at age 19, he married Sarah Margaret Tabitha Simms, she was 16 years old, at the Bethel Baptist Church in Heard County, Georgia. Sarah Simms was the daughter of John Simms and Comfort Maddox Grace. Comfort was born March 26, 1798, and married September 16, 1816 in Hancock, Georgia, she was the daughter of Thomas Grace and Sarah \\"Sally\\" Maddox.Troup County Archives, Troup Co., GA, Manuscript MS-105 c.1800-c.1916 Holland M. Ware Collection, article on Senator James B. Ware. On October 28, 1850, they purchased 202-1/2 acres from a neighbor, Thomas H. Hanson, and built their home. His superior abilities as a man of affairs being quickly recognized by his fellow citizens, he was elected Justice of the Peace at 21, serving eight years. In 1859 and 1860 he was elected to represent Heard County, Georgia in the general assembly. During the Civil War in 1863 James raised a company of seventy men, of which he was elected Captain of the State Guards. It became Company G, of Colonial Wilcoxon‚Äôs regiment of state troops and General Iverson‚Äôs Brigade, which took part in several skirmishes near Rome, Georgia. The decision to leave his family was hard because it meant leaving behind his wife and six small children, their ages being 10, 8, 6, 4, 2 and a newborn. His wife, Sarah, would be left alone to administer to all the needs of a large family and a large farm. He left with a heavy heart, to join the war effort. In 1864 he enlisted in the confederate service, in which he continued rendering valuable service until the surrender. During the Battle of Atlanta and Sherman's march, the Ware home served as a refuge for relatives and friends in the Atlanta area. During the \\"unpleasantness\\" he gave up his business and devoted money, time and labor to caring for the families of the soldiers, a noble service on his part which they never forgot, and were always ready to express their gratitude. Among his brothers who entered the war, only David and James returned home, his brother, John, Jr., left behind a wife, a small son. After his mother‚Äôs death in 1869, James purchased the family home from his siblings, and successfully managed his estate over the next 10 years. In 1872 he was incorporated in the Jury Commissioner‚Äôs Bill and served continuously until 1904. In 1874 he was elected to the Georgia Legislature receiving 500 of the 700 votes cast, working in both the House and Senate. In 1904 James was elected State Senator of the 37th District. While in the Senate he introduced and secured the passage of a bill making drunkenness on the public highway a crime, as well as introducing and having enacted the bill forbidding the sale of whiskey in Georgia within the radius of one mile from a church. He served as foreman of the grand jury over 21 times. He was also Treasurer of the Western Baptist Association, and President of the Corinth Agricultural and Horticultural Club.

Before his death he wrote the following words, \\"Nothing can give me more consolation in my old age than to see the people of my county obedient and submissive to the will of God which the Scriptures say is the beginning of his love. Oh, what days of rejoicing will be with the good people when the bottle and the pistol toter become a thing of the past.\\" At a reunion he said, \\"during my life, I set out to make a useful man of myself, and take such position in life that would make life worth living. My highest ambition in life was to raise my children to be men and women of integrity and dignity, these principles being the foundations of all greatness. To what extent I have instilled these principles into the minds of my children, I leave to my neighbors and to the public to decide. I admonished all my grandchildren, and their children to improve upon their parents.\\" He finished by saying that this day was a happy reunion day, but his prayer was that the world all live so that when death comes, we would meet again for a happy reunion in heaven. At his death at age 87, he had 40 grandchildren and 41 great grandchildren, and was one of Heard County‚Äôs leading citizens. This home recently burned to the ground during a lightning storm and nothing was saved.

Early life and education  She was born in Boston on June 7, 1901, to Jewish immigrant parents. Her father, Nathan Adlow, emigrated as a youth from Kazarez, Poland, and opened a furniture store in the Roxbury neighborhood of Boston. Her mother, Bessie (Bravman) Adlow, was born in Dauge, Lithuania. Her brother, Elijah Adlow, eventually became chief justice of the Boston Municipal Court. Dorothy grew up in Roxbury and attended Girls' Latin School. At her mother's urging, and despite her father's warnings that \\"if she gets too educated, she'll never marry,\\" she went on to earn a bachelor's and a master's degree from Radcliffe College, graduating in 1923.  Career  After college, Adlow worked briefly for the Boston Evening Transcript before beginning a 41-year career as an art critic for the Christian Science Monitor. She was the only member of the staff who was not a Christian Scientist. By her mid- twenties, she had achieved a remarkable level of independence and professional success for a young woman of her time. To supplement her income, Adlow traveled widely, lecturing at colleges and museums and serving as an art juror. In 1930 she lectured at the Carnegie International exhibit series in Pittsburgh, the first woman to do so. She also appeared frequently on television programs produced by the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, and taught at the Katharine Gibbs School. Adlow was Boston's leading art critic during the 1940s, when the city's art scene changed dramatically. She regularly attended exhibitions at the Museum School and discussed the students' work with Karl Zerbe. Jean Gibran, wife of the artist Kahlil Gibran, names Adlow in her memoir as one of those who contributed to the \\"flowering\\" of Boston Expressionism.  Personal life  In 1931, at the age of thirty, Adlow married composer-conductor Nicolas Slonimsky. She kept her maiden name and continued working, providing a small but steady income for the household while her husband's fortunes fluctuated. Her daughter Electra was born in 1933. Adlow corresponded frequently with her husband, who traveled a great deal. She carefully saved his letters, but her own letters to him have been lost. Her daughter published a posthumous collection of Slonimsky's letters titled Dear Dorothy: Letters from Nicolas Slonimsky to Dorothy Adlow (University of Rochester Press, 2012). She died of a heart attack on January 11, 1964, at her home on Beacon Street in Boston, aged 62.

It was initially released to the public by Microsoft as part of the Quantum Development Kit. History During a Microsoft Ignite Keynote on , Microsoft announced that they were going to release a new programming language geared specifically towards quantum computers. On , Microsoft released Q# as a part of the Quantum Development Kit. Usage Q# is available as a separately downloaded extension for Visual Studio, but it can also be run as an independent tool from the Command line and/or Visual Studio Code. The Quantum Development Kit ships with a quantum simulator which is capable of running Q#. In order to invoke the quantum simulator, another .NET programming language, usually C#, is used, which provides the (classical) input data for the simulator and reads the (classical) output data from the simulator. Features A primary feature of Q# is the ability to create and use qubits for algorithms. As a consequence, some of the most prominent features of Q# are the ability to entangle and introduce superpositioning to qubits via Controlled NOT gates and Hadamard gates, respectively, as well as Toffoli Gates, Pauli X, Y, Z Gate, and many more which are used for a variety of operations; see the list at the article on quantum logic gates. The hardware stack that will eventually come together with Q# is expected to implement Qubits as topological qubits. The quantum simulator that is shipped with the Quantum Development Kit today is capable of processing up to 32 qubits on a user machine and up to 40 qubits on Azure. Documentation and Resources Currently, the resources available for Q# are scarce, but the official documentation is published: Microsoft Developer Network: Q#. Microsoft Quantum Github repository is also a large collection of sample programs implementing a variety of Quantum algorithms and their tests. Microsoft has also hosted a Quantum Coding contest on Codeforces here: Microsoft Q# Coding Contest - Codeforces, and also provided related material to help answer the questions in the blog posts, plus the detailed solutions in the tutorials. Microsoft hosts a set of learning exercises to help learn Q# on github: microsoft/QuantumKatas with links to resources, and answers to the problems. Syntax Q# is syntactically related to both C# and F# yet also has some significant differences. Similarities with C# * Uses for code isolation * All statements end with a * Curly braces are used for statements of scope * Single line comments are done using * Variable data types such as and are similar, although capitalised (and Int is 64-bit) * Qubits are allocated and disposed inside a block. * Lambda functions using the \`=>\` operator. * Results are returned using the keyword. Similarities with F# * Variables are declared using either or * First-order functions * Modules, which are imported using the keyword * The datatype is declared after the variable name * The range operator * loops * Every operation/function has a return value, rather than . Instead of , an empty Tuple is returned. * Definition of record datatypes (using the keyword, instead of ). Differences * Functions are declared using the keyword * Operations on the quantum computer are declared using the keyword * Lack of multiline comments * Asserts instead of throwing exceptions * Documentation is written in Markdown instead of XML-based documentation tags References External links *Official documentation Category:Free and open-source software Category:Microsoft free software Category:Programming languages Category:Quantum programming Category:Programming languages created in 2017 Category:Software using the MIT license ","title":"Q Sharp"},{"id":"56025626","text":" The Silesia S-3 was the first design from the Polish Sopora brothers to fly. It was a low power, single seat, high wing light aircraft. Only one was built and its flying time was limited. Design and development Three brothers, Edward, Paul and Wojciech Sopora set up an aircraft-building workshop in 1923 at Chorz√≥w, calling it the Pierwsza ≈ölƒÖska Fabryka Samolot√≥w (First Silesian Aircraft Factory). Their first product was a light, low- powered, high wing monoplane, the Silesia S-3. Its wood-framed, thin section wing was in two parts joined to the upper fuselage longerons and was fabric covered. It was entirely wire-braced from a high, central cabane above the fuselage and a short cabane from its underside. The C-3 was powered by a Haacke HFM-2, a flat-twin mounted with its cylinders projecting outside the fuselage for cooling. Behind the engine the fuselage was flat-sided, with a steel-tube frame of rectangular section and fabric covering. The single, open cockpit was behind the upper cabane. Its empennage was wood-framed and fabric covered; the tailplane, on top of the fuselage, was wire braced to the top of a rounded fin. The rudder was also rounded in profile. Its fixed landing gear was of the tailskid type. The mainwheels were on a single axle which was mounted on two transverse tubes joining the apexes of two V-struts from the lower fuselage longerons. Operational history The S-3 was completed by October 1923 and in early November it made its first flight, piloted by Klosek, from the army field at Panewniki near Ligota. Several modifications followed, in particular addressing some longitudinal stability problems experienced on the first flight. On 16 November Klosek began its official flight trials in front of army observers. It made three flights, each lasting 10‚Äì15 minutes, reaching speeds of about , taking off in and with landing runs of . The S-3 continued to make short flights into 1924 but after a landing accident the Soporas decided that its Haake engine should be removed to power their next design, the Silesia S-4 and the S-3 was abandoned.

It dramatizes the fate of two Verdingkinder in Emmental.  Plot  Max is an orphan whose one true passion is to play the accordion. He is sent to the Bosigers farm where he meets Berteli who is also with the Bosigers as a foster child just like him. Even though they are cared for by being fed and sent to school, Max and Berteli are treated like servants on the farm. Berteli is upset from being separated from her mother and at first Mrs Bosiger shows a tenderness towards her by giving her chocolate while she cries at the dinner table. Max is indifferent towards Berteli in the beginning but later on develops a genuine affection towards her. Max has a pet rabbit which he loves and Berteli innocently tells Jakob, the Bosigers son, about it, who cruelly kills the rabbit and brings the meat for Mrs Bosiger to cook. When he reveals at the table that it was Max's rabbit that he brought, Max rushes outside disgusted, and vomits repulsed over eating his own rabbit. At school, Max and Berteli's teacher Miss. Sigrist, take a special interest in Max and encourages him to play his accordion for Wrestler's Day. The family enjoy the evening out on Wrestler's Day during which Jakob attempts to make sexual advances on Miss Sigrist, causing Max to intervene and beat up Jakob. Jakob takes his revenge on Max by burning his accordion. Life gets more unbearable for Berteli when Jakob now visits her room every night to rape her. Berteli tries to run away and return to her mother, who is unable to look after her but still begs the man she's living with to keep Berteli with her. He refuses and Berteli sensing her mother's dilemma,voluntarily leaves and says that she will go back to the Bosigers and that she came to see her because she was homesick. Unable to bear what is happening to them both, Max suggests that they should run away to Argentina where he can become a musician and earn a living. Miss Sigrist, tries to intervene and goes to the authorities to expose the abuse Max and Berteli are going through. Berteli becomes pregnant, and one day a horrified Max sees Jakob going to Berteli's room and confides in Miss Sigrist. Miss Sigrist visits the farm and tells Mrs. Bosiger that Jakob has been having sex with Berteli, upon which Mrs Bosiger becomes furious and throws her out. Miss Sigrist angrily tells Mrs Bosiger that it is her responsibility to care for these two children and not ignore what has been happening to Berteli. Miss Sigrist who has now lost her job because she tried to help Max and Berteli, leaves after giving Max a brand new accordion. Mrs. Bosiger sees Berteli vomiting and asks her why she is sick to which replies that it is because of what Jakob does to her at night. Mrs. Bosiger gets angry and forces Berteli to admit that she is lying, but however, she does confront Jakob who doesn't admit or deny anything. Mrs. Bosiger makes Berteli to drink a bottle of castor oil as part of a home remedy abortion, and at night Berteli's screams are heard by Max as she starts aborting the baby. A heavily intoxicated Mr. Bosiger prevents Max from going to Berteli and forces him to play his accordion to hide her screams. Max visits Berteli after her contractions stop and Mrs. Bosiger is seen changing the blood stained sheets. The two plan to run away to Argentina as soon as Berteli becomes better, however she dies and it is unclear whether Berteli has committed suicide or succumbed to infection. The authorities investigate and Mrs Bosiger and Jakob claim that Berteli's death was of a suicide. When the Reverend starts to pray before taking Berteli's body away, Max comes shouting the truth behind Berteli's death. Mr. Bosiger shows the authorities the bottle of castor oil that Mrs Bosigner forced Berteli to drink. The authorities are now aware of the abuse foster children suffer and plan to investigate further. Max runs away to Argentina and gets onto a ship where he works and plays his accordion to make a living. Although he is sad about Berteli's passing he narrates as though he is speaking to her about how much he earns, his work, the food he gets to eat and about how he is no longer beaten at work. He says that he will continue to communicate with Berteli who is in heaven with her father and Max's rabbit through his music. The ending scene shows Max now an old man playing his accordion to an audience at his own concert indicating that he managed to reach Argentina and become the musician he always dreamed of becoming.

It is one of the last surviving beech-maple mesic forests in Wisconsin. The forest was founded in 1855 when the seminary moved to St. Francis from Milwaukee and the land that was originally purchased by the Lake Drive Franciscan Sisters became part of the newly established seminary. The forest consists of 68 acres and is located near Lake Michigan. It attracts attention from naturalists for the forest's beech-maple composition and wild flowers that bloom in the spring. A striking feature of the forest is the seminary's cemetery that lies hidden among the trees.  History  Although the woods lie on seminary property, the forest was first owned by the Sisters of St. Francis of Assisi in 1833. The land was acquired by the sisters from the Potawatomi Indians living in the area at the time. It was not until 1855 that Saint Francis de Sales Seminary was built and the forest became part of its property. The forest has survived colonization and urbanization because its natural beauty led it to be used as a place for reflection by members of the seminary.  Natural history  Deer in front of the Saint Francis de Sale Seminary. These deer live within Seminary Woods. The forest obtained its distinct beech-maple forest from soil deposits made by glacial movement 11,000 years ago. Several species of wildflowers, wildlife, and trees are spotted in the forest. Mature trees found in the forest include, basswood, sugar maple, beech, red oak, and paper birch. The forest also has a small stream that flows into nearby Lake Michigan. Wildflowers include, trillium, white trout lily, yellow trout lily, bloodroot, the endangered blue stemmed goldenrod, and hepatica. Wildlife found in the area include great horned owls, white tailed deer, coyotes, and migratory birds.Milwaukee County LWRMP (April 2006). \\"Chapter 2.

The \\"Skaista ezers\\", which is Latvian for \\"Beautiful Lake\\" is also located within the nature reserve. In 2007 a trail of wooden planks was built in the southern area of the reserve. It leads from the end of the peat extraction area in a circle and has a total length of 5 kilometers. On the widest point away from the start, close to an old military road from WW1, a bird watching tower and picnic tables can be found. Along the way, several information boards explain about the resident flora and fauna as well as about the peat industry in Latvia and the world in Latvian and English language. According to those information boards, peat is still used as energy source in Latvia and accounts for around 1% of the total energy mix.

His focus has been to actively support a free market approach to transport services, boost investments by leading global companies, digitalization of infrastructure, encourage innovation as well as advocating for breakthrough ideas in the transport sector. The Ministry of Infrastructure, together with state enterprises reporting to the Ministry, accounts for roughly 25% of all governmental purchases. By using the ProZorro system for procurement, the Ministry has saved more than UAH 9 billion in infrastructure tenders over the last two years. At the same time, the competitiveness index of purchases and absence of monopoly in the Ministry of Infrastructure is on 30-50% higher than the national average. Volodymyr Omelyan is a member of the National Investment Council of Ukraine.  Aviation Sector  Conducted in 2016, the reform of the State Aviation Service of Ukraine introduced the principles of transparency and fair competition. As a result, since 2016, the air market has been growing at a record pace - 30% per year. Volodymyr Omelyan initiated the launch in Ukraine of the biggest low-cost airline in Europe - Ryanair and announced 2018th a year of budget airlines in Ukraine. In 2017 the passenger traffic carried by Ukrainian airlines increased by 29,6% and the passengers flow through the Ukrainian airports grew up to 28,8%. Since 2015 the number of air lines that are served by low-cost carriers has doubled ‚Äì from 18 to 38 routes. Kyiv's Boryspil International Airport reached the highest indicators in its history ‚Äì for one year the number of passengers increased by 2 million and reached the level of 10,45 million passengers including 3 million of transfer passengers attracted from foreign markets. In 2017, Ukraine successfully passed the audit of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO).

Passenger traffic through Ukraine's airports in January ‚Äì June 2018 increased by 26%. In spring 2018, the Ryanair entered the Ukrainian market and began to sell flight tickets at a price from 10 euros. A national airline SkyUp was established. It carries out budget transportation and has already ordered from Boeing company five ultra- modern airplanes of model Boeing 737 Max. Work on modernizing and expanding service at regional airport continues. The construction of the runway in Odesa airport has begun and this will turn Odessa into a south-hub. On July 10, 2018 UkSATSE and European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) signed Certification of UkSATSE's services on their compliance with EU norms and this opened the way for the restoration of the full-fledged work of the Uzhhorod Airport. In general, more than 10 regional airports have already resumed their work.  Automobile and Urban Transport  Important steps have been taken in the reformation of passenger bus traffic, in particular: the introduction of a competition for interregional bus routes on an applicant's basis; compulsory use on urban and suburban routes buses adapted for the transportation of people with disabilities; advantages on the competition for carriers offering a low-floor buses, electric buses, buses with a higher category of environmental friendliness (Euro 3 - Euro 6); introduction of the electronic register of bus routes and others. The ultimate goal of the bus reform is to ensure the highest level of passenger safety, completely liberalize market and create all conditions for the work of responsible carriers, to replace the jitneys (‚Äúmashrutki‚Äù) with Neoplan buses or their analogues, to create a convenient network of routes and modern bus stations. In 2017, a new electronic system for the transparent distribution of permits issued by the European Conference of Ministers of Transport (ECMT) was introduced, which increased the number of ECMT permits by 7%, carriers by 16% and vehicles by 24%. The Law of Ukraine was adopted to introduce modern systems of payment for fares and an electronic ticket in urban passenger transport by local self- government bodies.

Beginning January 1, 2018, Ukravtodor is responsible for 47 thousand km of state roads of national and international importance. 123 thousand km of roads were transferred to local authorities with appropriate financing. The maintenance and construction of regional roads will be funded by 35% of the Road Fund which is proportionally distributed between the regions. In 2018 this amounted to 11.5 billion UAH for regional roads. In total, 32.6 billion UAH was budgeted for road reconstruction nationally. For the first time in the history, Ukraine has designated source of financing for the repair and construction of highways. Beginning in 2018, all roads must be built with a 5-10 year warranty and in accordance with the CoST standards.  Road Safety  The newly established Road Fund also allocates for the first time, 5% per year for road safety. The Ministry of Infrastructure developed and the government approved a three-year program for increasing the level of road safety in Ukraine through 2020.

Within the framework of the Program, the goal is to reduce road deaths by 30% by 2020. The improvement of road safety and efforts to reduce the destruction of roads by overweight trucks, will be facilitated by the use of 78 new mobile weight control systems and the establishment of 10 stationary Weight-in-Motion systems (WIM). More than 300 WiM-complexes are planned to be installed in the future.

Second-parent adoption is of significant importance in the context of the LGBT adoption. In the United States, second-parent adoption was started by the National Center for Lesbian Rights (formerly the Lesbian Rights Project) in the mid-1980s.

Courts in many states have granted second-parent adoptions to same-sex couples, though there is no statewide law or court decision that guarantees this. In fact, courts within the same state but in different jurisdictions often contradict each other in practice. However, The American Medical Association supported second parent adoption by same-sex partner, stating that lack of formal recognition can cause health- care disparities for children of same-sex parents. The American Academy of Pediatrics also supports second parent adoption. Countries other than America similarly support second-parent adoption. In July 2011, The Ministry of Labour, Family and Social Affairs of Slovenia stated that the existing law allows for second-parent adoption. In the context of LGBT adoption and parenting in Australia, As of 2008, the best option was to apply to the Family Court of Australia for a parenting order, as ‚Äòother people significant to the care, welfare and development‚Äô of the child. It provides an important \\"status quo\\" if the birth mother were to die, preventing other family members from taking immediate custody of the child. United States If second-parent adoption is not a legal option in certain counties or states, the Human Rights Campaign suggests taking precautionary steps, such as: a written custody agreement or a co-parent agreement between partners. Also suggested is gathering evidence to prove you are a family.rightthumb300pxLegal status of adoption by same-sex couples around the world: {  !American States !Do they allow second-parent adoption for married couples? !Do they allow second-parent adoption for unmarried and/or domestic partners (whether same-sex or opposite sex)? !Do they explicitly state they allow same-sex couples the right to second-parent adoption? - Alabama Yes No Yes (in certain counties) - Alaska Yes Yes No - Arizona Yes Yes No - Arkansas Yes Yes No - California Yes Yes Yes - Colorado Yes Yes Yes - Connecticut Yes Yes Yes - Delaware Yes Yes Yes (in certain counties) - District of Columbia Yes Yes Yes - Florida Yes Yes Yes (in certain counties) - Georgia Yes Yes Yes (in certain counties) - Hawaii Yes Yes Yes (in certain counties) - Idaho Yes Yes Yes - Illinois Yes Yes Yes - Indiana Yes Yes Yes - Iowa Yes Yes Yes (in certain counties) - Kansas Yes No No - Kentucky Yes No No - Louisiana Yes Yes Yes (in certain counties) - Maine Yes Yes Yes - Maryland Yes Yes Yes (in certain counties) - Massachusetts Yes Yes Yes - Michigan Yes Yes No - Minnesota Yes Yes Yes (in certain counties) - Mississippi Yes Yes No - Missouri Yes Yes No - Montana Yes Yes No - Nebraska Yes No Yes - Nevada Yes Yes No - New Hampshire Yes Yes No - New Jersey Yes Yes Yes - New Mexico Yes Yes No - New York Yes Yes Yes - North Carolina Yes No No - North Dakota Yes Yes No - Ohio Yes No No - Oklahoma Yes Yes Yes - Oregon Yes Yes Yes (in certain counties) - Pennsylvania Yes Yes Yes - Rhode Island Yes Yes Yes (in certain counties) - South Carolina Yes Yes No - South Dakota Yes Yes No - Tennessee Yes Yes No - Texas Yes Yes Yes (in certain counties) - Utah Yes No No - Vermont Yes Yes Yes - Virginia Yes Yes No - Washington Yes Yes Yes (in certain counties) - West Virginia Yes Yes Yes (in certain counties) - Wisconsin Yes No No - Wyoming Yes Yes No } See also *Stepparent adoption *X and Others v Austria *LGBT adoption References Category:Family law Category:Adoption, fostering, orphan care and displacement Category:LGBT rights de:Adoption#Stiefkindadoption la:Status liberorum parentum eiusdem sexus#coadoptio ","title":"Second-parent adoption"},{"id":"56026078","text":"The Slap () is a 1974 French / Italian comedy film directed by Claude Pinoteau.

The palace is located in the historic center of Cetinje, near the Cetinje Monastery. Prince-Bishop Petar II Petroviƒá-Njego≈° started the building of the palace on 29 March 1838. Initially, it was called the 'New House', but soon it got its new name 'Biljarda' (Billiard House) after the central room on the first floor which contained a billiard table, the prince-bishop's favorite game. Designed by the Russian Lieutenant Colonel Jakov Nikolaevich Ozeretskovsky, the Biljarda palace has the appearance of a medieval fortified feudal castle: a rectangular two-storied stone building, covered with lead, enclosed by a high stone wall with four defensive towers on the corners. At the time of its construction, it was an impressive building, over 70 metres in length and 7.5 metres wide. It contains eleven rooms on the ground floor and 14 rooms on the first floor. The palace was not only the home of the prince- bishop, but also provided accommodation to the Senate and other state authorities as well as being a guest house for important visitors. The palace served as a royal residence until 1867, when the Montenegrin royal family moved to King Nikola's Palace. At the start of the 20th century, it housed various ministries and the two world wars it was used by the military. Currently, it is part of the National Museum of Montenegro. Bibliography * Du≈°an D.

A continuous core sample of late Pliocene and early Pleistocene sediments of the Crag Group was recovered. Analysis allowed biostratigraphic zonal schemes for fossil pollen, foraminifera, mollusca and dinoflagellates to be constructed for horizons of the Red Crag and Norwich Crag Formations, and for these formations to be thus correlated with strata of equivalent age in the North Sea basin and north-west Europe.

In 1950 a pilot borehole was put down for exploratory water supply purposes at the Smallburgh Rural District Council waterworks at Wateringpiece Lane, Catfield, near Ludham. Investigation of sediment samples was carried out for fossil foraminiferan content by Brian Funnell and for pollen by Colin Forbes. In 1959 the Royal Society of London financed a research borehole located 80 m to the east. It penetrated Pliocene and Pleistocene deposits of the Crag Group to a depth of 50 m, and found them resting on deposits of the Eocene London Clay Formation.Funnell, BM (1961).

Fauna and flora Molluscs Work by Norton (1967) investigated the molluscan fossils from the Ludham Borehole. A sequence of six biostratigraphic assemblage zones was identified, and the results correlated with palaeontological research at this and other sites.Norton, PEP (1967). Marine Molluscan Assemblages in the Early Pleistocene of Sidestrand, Bramerton and the Royal Society Borehole at Ludham, Norfolk. Philosophic Transactions of the Royal Society of London, Series B, vol.253, no.784. It was noted by Norton (1977) that the molluscan fauna gave no indication of the clearly cyclical temperature changes evident from pollen and foraminiferal fossils in the Ludham sequence, and hence it was unreliable for palaeoclimatic interpretation.Norton, PEP (1977). Marine Mollusca in the East Anglian pre- glacial Pleistocene. In: Shotton, FW (ed). British Quaternary Studies - Recent Advances. Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1977. Plants A sequence of pollen assemblage zones was identified by West (1962), which permitted the designation of five biostratigraphic stages. 1. (the oldest) Ludhamian, with temperate mixed coniferous/deciduous forest including Tsuga and Pterocarya; 2. Thurnian, a glacial stage with an oceanic heath type of vegetation; 3. Antian, with temperate mixed coniferous/deciduous forest including Tsuga and Pterocarya; 4. Baventian, a glacial stage more severe than the Thurnian, with the return of oceanic heaths; 5. An unnamed stage with temperate mixed coniferous/deciduous forest lacking Pterocarya and with only a few traces of Tsuga. These stages were provisionally correlated with Early Pleistocene stages in the Netherlands: the Ludhamian with the Tiglian, the Thurnian with Eburonian, the Antian with Waalian, and the Baventian with Menapian. The unnamed stage was later tentatively correlated with the Pastonian. West, RG (1980). The pre-glacial Pleistocene of the Norfolk and Suffolk Coasts. Cambridge University Press. . Further work was later conducted on Ludham pollen samples, yielding evidence for input by British rivers into the Crag sedimentary sequence in the southern North Sea basin.Riding, JB, Moorlock, SP, Jeffrey, DH & Hamblin, RJO (1997). Reworked and indigenous palynomorphs from the Norwich Crag Formation (Pleistocene) of eastern Suffolk: implications for provenance, palaeogeography and climate. Proceedings of the Geologists‚Äô Association, vol. 108, pt.1. Dinoflagellates Dinoflagellate assemblages were analysed by Wall & Dale (1968), and were found to correspond with five facies associations in the sequence identified by West (1962).Wall, D & Dale, B (1968). Early Pleistocene dinoflagellates from the Royal Society borehole at Ludham Norfolk. New Phytologist, vol.67, pp.315-326. More detailed work was later conducted by Head (1996), permitting the identification of over 29 species. Foraminifers A sequence of seven foraminiferal assemblage zones were identified by Funnell (1961) on the basis of research into the Ludham Pilot Boring. Those from the lower part of the sequence were correlated with the Red Crag Formation and from the upper part with the Norwich Crag Formation. The uppermost zone (7) had an arctic-type fauna correlated with the Weybourne Crag (now referred to the Wroxham Crag Formation).

They are listed by type of road, then alphabetically.  Arterial roads   Albion Road  Albion Road and Kipling Avenue in 2008 Albion Road was created as a private road for French teacher Jean du Petit Pont de la Haye (1799‚Äì1872) to his estate in the area (the plank road was built in 1846 by Weston Plank Road Company from Musson's Bridge over Humber River to Bolton). Originally called Clairville, it was renamed for the Albion Township, which was the eastern third of the present-day (since 1973/1974) boundaries of Caledon. The road is located within Toronto, starting at the intersection of Weston Road and Walsh Avenue (continues eastward as Wilson Avenue) and heads northwest to Albion and Steeles (becoming County Road 50). The beginning of the road is Walsh Avenue, a short connector between Albion Road and Wilson Avenue. The intersection at Weston Road and Walsh Avenue is a ramp with two traffic lights for Albion Road/Walsh Avenue and none for Weston Road. Albion Road northwest of Highway 27 was formerly Highway 50, but later became Peel Regional Road 50 and Simcoe County Road 50. The northern end of Highway 50 is Ontario Highway 89 by the town of New Tecumseth in Simcoe County. Albion Road is served by TTC route 73C and the southern section is served by route 118.  Danforth Road  Danforth Road is a historically related arterial street in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Danforth Road splits off Danforth Avenue west of Warden Avenue and runs diagonally northeast until south of Lawrence Avenue, where it continues as McCowan Road. McCowan Road ends at Baseline Road located in Georgina, which is the northernmost municipality in York Region. Line 2 Bloor‚ÄìDanforth of the Toronto subway runs just north of Danforth Avenue from the Don River as far as Main Street station, before gradually veering north as it heads east. The route is also served by TTC route 16.  Kingston Road  Kingston Road is the southernmost major road along the eastern portion of Toronto, specifically in the district of Scarborough. Until 1998, it formed a portion of Highway 2. The name of the street is derived from Kingston, Ontario, as the road was the primary route used to travel from Toronto to the settlements east of it situated along the shores of Lake Ontario; in the west end of Kingston, this highway was referred to as the York Road (referring to Toronto) until at least 1908. Due to its diagonal course near the shore of Lake Ontario, the street is the terminus of many arterial roads in eastern Toronto, both east‚Äìwest and north‚Äìsouth, with a few continuing for a short distance after as minor residential streets. However, Lawrence Avenue continues as a major arterial for a considerable distance beyond it. Kingston Road is served by Toronto Transit Commission routes 502/503/22A, 12, 102 and 86/86E/905.  Rexdale Boulevard  Rexdale Boulevard is a short, but major east‚Äìwest but mostly diagonal roadway in Rexdale, a neighbourhood in Toronto, and begins as a spur road off Islington Avenue just north of the 401. This spur originally began in the former village of Weston as a road northwest to what would later become Brampton, Ontario. The current road passes through a mostly light industrial stretch of north Etobicoke. West of Highway 427, Rexdale Boulevard becomes Derry Road and enters the city of Mississauga. Derry is also signed as Peel Regional Road 5, an east‚Äìwest route that travels the entire length of the city of Mississauga and Peel Region. Derry Road is the northern boundary of Toronto Pearson International Airport. The intersection of Derry and Airport Road was once the site of Malton, itself a part of Mississauga. West of the intersection with Mavis Road, the road makes a large arc around the former village of Meadowvale. The bypassed stretch was renamed Old Derry Road and can also be seen in a small stretch of Syntex Crescent. Derry Road is named for the \\"lost village\\" of Derry West, which was located around the Hurontario Street and Derry intersection. Derry West was named after Derry in Northern Ireland and home of many settlers in the area. West of Highway 407, Derry Road enters Halton Region as Halton Regional Road 7. This stretch of road is mainly rural except for the section between James Snow Parkway and Tremaine Road in Milton. After passing through another rural stretch, the road ends at Milburough Line in the town of Carlisle in Hamilton (formerly in Flamborough before amalgamating with Hamilton in January 2001). The street is served by TTC route 37A, a branch of 37 Islington.  Collector roads  Chaplin Crescent Chaplin Crescent is a diagonal street located in Toronto, Ontario. The street runs almost entirely just north of the Kay Gardner Beltline Park, a former railway meant to serve the community of Forest Hill, and primarily runs parallel to it. The street has several parks on it: Castlefield Parkette, Forest Hill Memorial Park, Larratt Parkette, Robert Bateman Parkette, and Oriole Park. At the southeast end of the street where it crosses Yonge Street, it becomes Davisville Avenue. Chaplin Crescent is served by TTC route 14 Glencairn.  Dawes Road  Dawes Road is a spur of Victoria Park Avenue. The road is named for Clem Dawes, a farmer on Lot 2 Concession 2 of York Township and later hotel owner.http://eastyork.org/eyhs/dawesroad.pdf The street has a bridge over the Taylor-Massey Creek. The street between Victoria Park and Pharmacy Avenues is an east‚Äìwest road running just south of St. Clair Avenue. There is a gap between the east‚Äìwest Dawes Road and the diagonal Dawes Road. Dawes Road is served by TTC route 23.  Trethewey Drive  Trethewey Drive, formerly named Holmstead Drive, was a private rural road on the land of mining magnate and owner of the Trethewey Model Farm William Griffith Trethewey (1865‚Äì1926).http://www.trainweb.org/oldtimetrains/CPR_Toronto/TRE_MO_F.htm In 1910, the property became the site of Toronto's first airplane flight, with French ace Count Jacques de Lesseps circling the city. Trethewey Airfield, later renamed De Lesseps Field, hosted de Havilland Canada and the Royal Canadian Air Force before the land was sold for development in 1941. The boroughs of North York and York later assumed control of the road. The street is served by TTC route 32C Eglinton West and will be served by TTC route 58 in 2022 after Line 5 Eglinton is opened.  Vaughan Road  streetcar track in the Old Toronto segment. Vaughan Road is named after the Township (later City) of Vaughan, which in turn was named after Benjamin Vaughan, a British commissioner whose role was to smooth negotiations between Britain and the newly independent United States during the drafting of the Treaty of Paris in 1783. The neighbourhood of Oakwood‚ÄìVaughan (later officially renamed Oakwood Village for the main commercial strip on Oakwood Avenue at Rogers Road), as well as former high school Vaughan Road Academy, are named after this street. Vaughan Road's contour is the result of it being parallel to the partially buried Castle Frank Brook to the northeast. Vaughan Road is served by TTC bus route 90. There are streetcar tracks on the road south of St. Clair Avenue to allow 512 St. Clair streetcars to use the depots located closer to the lakeshore by the rest of the TTC streetcar system.

Personal life Cachoeira had a troubled childhood growing up. She played volleyball for Fluminense, but was stabbed in the back and removed from the team. In her youth Cachoeira's father refused to admit that she was his daughter, her brother-in-law sexually molested her, and she discovered that her boyfriend was cheating on her. In her 20s Cachoeira became addicted to crack cocaine, and would spend many years of her life as an addict before her mother finally managed to help her leave her addiction and turn to mixed martial arts. Cachoeira has a son born in 2013. She was in a relationship with another woman until 2018, when they split up because her partner was spending all her money. While recovering from her knee injury, Cachoeira's training was sponsored by Brazilian football club Vasco da Gama. Career Cachoeira made her UFC debut on 3 February 2018 at UFC Fight Night 125 against Valentina Shevchenko. She lost the fight via rear-naked choke in the second round as Shevchenko thoroughly dominated Cachoeira, outstriking her 230-3. Referee Mario Yamasaki was harshly criticized by UFC president Dana White for not stopping the fight sooner. Cachoeira suffered a knee injury in the fight with Shevchenko which required surgery, and kept her out of the sport for more than a year. Cachoeira's second UFC fight came on 15 March 2019 against Molly McCann at UFC Fight Night: Till vs. Masvidal. She lost the fight via unanimous decision. A flyweight bout between Luana Carolina and Yanan Wu was scheduled for UFC 237. However it was reported on 22 April 2019 that Wu had pulled out of the event due to injury and she was replaced by Cachoeira. Carolina went on to defeat Cachoeira by unanimous decision. Cachoeira was expected to face Ariane Lipski at UFC on ESPN+ 22. However, Cachoeira was removed from the card after testing positive for a banned substance that was collected on October 12, 2019 during an out-of-competition urine sample. In turn, Lipski was re- scheduled to fight at UFC Fight Night: Ortega vs. Korean Zombie against Veronica Macedo on December 21, 2019. Cachoeira was suspended by USADA for four months for testing positive for (diuretic), hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) and its metabolites chlorothiazide and 4amino-6chloro-1,3-benzenedisulfonamide (ACB). She was eligible to fight again on February 12, 2020. Cachoeira faced Shana Dobson on February 23, 2020 at UFC Fight Night 168. She won the fight via knockout in the first round. The win also recorded the fastest finish in UFC Women's Flyweight history. This win earned her a Performance of the Night award.

The original terminal is being preserved in the center of the television and radio complex of Abu Dhabi Media Company, off Muroor Road near the junction with 17th street.  History  The history of aviation in Abu Dhabi began in 1955, when a 3,000-foot sand runway was built, along with a tiny sandstone terminal. When the airport opened, there was no control tower and air traffic controllers had to peak their head through a window to see if the runway was clear for landing or takeoff. A small wind turbine was next to the terminal in order to cool down the interior of the building. The first flights were operated by the local airline Gulf Aviation, which flew seven-seater De Havilland Doves and larger De Havilland Herons from Doha Airport. These aircraft would use the airport as a stopover en route to nearby Sharjah. In its first years, there was only one flight weekly in each direction. There were not runway lights so flights could only be made during the day, however on some occasions there were night operations. Also, during the winter months it occasionally rains and puts the airport out of operations. All these inconveniences gave the airfield bad reputation among pilots and passengers. In 1960, Gulf Aviation expanded its route network to Bahrain, Kuwait, Dhahran, and Muscat. The following year services were started to Dubai. In 1963, a small parking lot was added along with a terminal extension to accommodate added airport services. Several other extensions were made in the following 2 years, such as a smaller building built alongside the original terminal to deal with a more airport services. The parking lot was so extended too. In 1966, Fokker F27 Friendships replaced the De Havilland Doves and De Havilland Herons that regularly operated at the airport. These newly introduced aircraft created a massive boom and it quickly grew saturated. By 1967, the local government began a project with the British to build a massive new airport, with a runway longer than the runways at London Heathrow Airport. During this time, the British airline British Overseas Airways Corporations showed interest in beginning operations to the airfield. This led to the construction of a massive new terminal was able to handle both airlines. B.O.A.C. began flights from Abu Dhabi to London using Bristol Britannia by the beginning of 1968. At this time, the new terminal had opened and had replaced the old terminal. This new terminal did not help as the new route to London quickly grew popular and the air terminal became saturated in a matter of months. Construction had already started on the new airport and was expected to open in 1970, however due to great weather conditions the construction was finished in late 1969. The new facility was named Abu Dhabi International Airport (known today as Al Bateen Executive Airport), and it became the main airport of Abu Dhabi and the emirate in general. All operations were relocated on its opening day and the old facility was abandoned.  Historical Airlines and Destinations  {  + !Airline ! - B.O.A.C.

The palace was built in the 14th century for prince Zhu Gui, prince of Dai, the thirteenth son of Zhu Yuanzhang, the first emperor of the Ming Dynasty (1368 - 1644). The palace was similar in construction to the Forbidden City in Beijing, but was constructed 25 years earlier. After prince Zhu Gui, ten other princes followed. The palace was gutted during the social breakdown at the end of the Ming dynasty in 1644, when the peasant rebellion under Li Zicheng reached Datong. At the start of the 21st century, rebuilding started in order to return the historic center of Datong. The size of the palace was around 180,000 square metres. It had multiple courtyards and at the center there was the Palace of Eternal Spring. All the palace buildings had jade green rooftops. The gate of benevolence and ritual reminded the princes of their duty to be kind to the people through benevolence, whilst knowing their master through ritual. Opposite the palace stands a Nine-Dragon Wall, the oldest and biggest (45x8 meters) wall still preserved in China. These types of walls were designed to protect palaces from evil spirits and negative energy.

As of July 2015, Dolan has been the Dean of the College at Princeton University, where she is also the Annan Professor in English and a professor of theatre studies in the Lewis Center for the Arts. Prior to Princeton, Dolan served as the Department Head of Theater and Dance at the University of Texas at Austin. Dolan's notable works include her blog The Feminist Spectator, for which she received the 2011 George Jean Nathan Award for Dramatic Criticism, and Theater and Sexuality. Dolan also edited Menopausal Gentlemen: Plays and Performances of Peggy Shaw which won the Lambda Literary Award for Best LGBT Drama. Dolan has received numerous accolades and achievements throughout her career as an educator. She received the William Kiekhofer Award for Excellence in Teaching from the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison, where she held a faculty position from 1988 to 1994. In 2006, Dolan was inducted into the University of Texas at Austin's Academy of Distinguished Teachers. In 2011, Dolan was awarded the Outstanding Teaching Award from the Association for Theater in Higher Education as well as a Lifetime Achievement Award from the Women and Theater Program. Jill Dolan received her PhD in performance studies from New York University. Dolan was elected as a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2016.  Notable work  Jill Dolan's blog, The Feminist Spectator (which launched in 2005) received the George Jean Nathan Award for Dramatic Criticism in 2012. Dolan was \\"only the seventh woman out of 56 winner's in the prize's history\\" (Fricker). While much of her blog consists of theatrical criticism, Dolan also regularly provides commentary on film and television. Dolan's blog frequently incorporates \\"issues of gender and sexuality (and difference, more broadly)\\" (Fricker). Jill Dolan's Theater & Sexuality is part of Palgrave and Macmillan's Theater& series, a compilation of titles by various experts in the Theatrical discipline that seeks to analyze intersectional themes in theater for a wider audience. While Dolan receives criticism for limiting her explorations to an explicitly Western canon of theatrical literature (Sloan 323), she is praised for her ability to take the complexity of sexuality, identity, and LGBTQ subjects and facilitate them toward a broad audience without losing the nuances of each subject. Dolan formats her book with an introduction by Tim Miller, a historical overview of sexuality within the theory and practice of theater, the social constructionist frame of thought as defined by Michel Foucault and Judith Butler and finishes her work with a textual analysis of Belle Reprieve. Throughout, the book Dolan guides a general audience through the history of LGBTQ rights, performances, and practice through the theatrical medium. Other works include: Wendy Wassertein (University of Michigan Press, 2017), Utopia in Performance: Finding Hope at the Theater (Michigan, 2005), and Presence and Desire: Essays on Gender, Sexuality, Performance (Michigan, 1994).

The 29th Division War Memorial is a war memorial beside the junction of the A45 and the B4455 near Stretton-on-Dunsmore, near Rugby, Warwickshire. It commemorates the service of the British 29th Division during the First World War. The memorial became a Grade II listed building in 1987, upgraded to Grade II* in 2015, and it is described by Historic England as \\"probably the most significant single memorial in Britain associated with the Gallipoli campaign\\". Background The 29th Division was assembled in the East Midlands from late 1914, from largely regular army units returned from garrison duty in various parts of the British Empire. Approximately 18,000 servicemen paraded near Rugby on 12 March 1915, formed into a marching column approximately long which was reviewed by the King, George V. The column took over an hour to pass the King, who took the salute mounted on his horse Delhi. Soon afterwards, the 29th Division left England for war service abroad: with the Royal Naval Division, the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps and the French Corps exp√©ditionnaire d'Orient, it formed the Mediterranean Expeditionary Force that landed on the Gallipoli peninsula in April 1915. The British forces withdrew in January 1916 and the 29th Division was redeployed to France, serving on the Western Front, including the first day of the Battle of the Somme, and also at the Battle of Arras and the Third Battle of Ypres (Passchendaele), and then was part of the British Army of the Rhine that occupied parts of Germany after the Armistice. By the time it was disbanded in March 1919, the division had suffered some 94,000 casualties. Memorial The memorial was designed and constructed by Robert Bridgeman and Sons from Lichfield. It comprises a tapering monolith of Portland stone topped by a stone urn with crown and orb, standing on a square pedestal. The north side of the pedestal bears the red triangle insignia of the division, above which is a panel with the inscription: \\"HERE / IN THE CENTRE OF ENGLAND / WHERE TELFORD'S COACHING-ROAD / FROM LONDON TO HOLYHEAD / IS CROSSED BY THE ROMAN FOSSE WAY / ON THE 12TH OF MARCH 1915 / HIS MAJESTY KING GEORGE V / REVIEWED HIS TROOPS / OF THE IMMORTAL / XXIX DIVISION / SHORTLY BEFORE THEY EMBARKED / FOR ACTIVE SERVICE / IN GALLIPOLI\\" and carries on in smaller type \\"IN MEMORY OF THEIR STAY IN WARWICKSHIRE / 1914-15 AND OF THEIR INCOMPARABLE SERVICES / SINCE THE AVENUE ON THIS ROAD WAS REPLANTED / AND THIS MONUMENT ERECTED BY / INHABITANTS OF THE COUNTY\\". Inscriptions on the base of the pedestal record the division's order of battle. It was erected after the war, near the place where the 29th Division was reviewed in 1915. The ¬£646 cost was raised from public subscriptions, and ¬£720 donated by John Montagu Douglas Scott, 7th Duke of Buccleuch who also donated the land for the memorial. The memorial was unveiled by the Lord Lieutenant of Warwickshire William Craven, 4th Earl of Craven at a ceremony attended by over 7,000 people on 24 May 1921, Empire Day. It was accepted by the Chairman of Warwickshire County Council Lord Algernon Percy and dedicated by the Bishop of Coventry Huyshe Yeatman-Biggs. The memorial stands in circle of gravel with an avenue of lime trees. The limes were planted in the 1950s and later renewed, and replace the remains of a long avenue of elm trees to either side of the London Road (now the A45) planted in the early 18th century across Dunsmore Heath which had themselves been renewed as part of the memorial project in 1920-21 after many were blown down by a storm in 1912. Two captured field guns were displayed to either side of the memorial, but it is believed that they were removed as scrap metal during the Second World War. The site is now within a roundabout installed in the mid-1980s at the junction of the A45 (close to the A5 route from London to Holyhead which follows the line of the Roman Watling Street) and the B4455 (part of the Roman Fosse Way from Exeter to Lincoln).

She appeared on the cover of The Business of Fashion in May 2018 alongside Kim Kardashian with an interview as part of 'The Age of Influence' series.  Education  Burke trained as a primary school teacher, graduating from Marino Institute of Education at the top of her class and winning the Vere Foster medal. She is currently working on a PhD at Trinity College, Dublin on human rights education, with a particular focus on how schools allow children to have a voice.  Fashion and design activism  As a 16-year old, Burke often felt excluded from fashion conversations and experiences due to her limited choices available to her as someone with achondroplasia, so she started blogging to highlight the exclusive nature of the fashion industry. \\"People didn‚Äôt take me seriously because of my physical aesthetic, so I started blogging‚Ä¶ and calling out the [fashion] industry\\". She co-founded the Inclusive Fashion and Design Collective (IFDC) with the US disability advocate Liz Jackson in order to \\"challenge designers who traditionally haven‚Äôt been thinking very diversely, to work with people with disabilities, and find beautiful solutions to these problems. Aesthetics are so important, but if you look at products specifically designed for the disabled community, they‚Äôre quite ugly.\\" Jackson and Burke were invited to attend the White House for an event titled 'Design for all' where the Obama administration highlighted the intersection of fashion and disability. Burke actively campaigns to highlight the importance of inclusive design in all areas of life due to the practical challenges she faces in living and moving in a world that was not designed for people with disabilities. \\"Design is an enormous privilege, but it is a bigger responsibility\\". In 2012, Burke as Miss Minnie M√©lange won the final Alternative Miss Ireland competition. In 2019, Burke became the first little person to attend the Met Gala. She was one of 15 women selected to appear on the cover of the September 2019 issue of British Vogue, by guest editor Meghan, Duchess of Sussex. Burke is an ambassador for the Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children and the Irish Girl Guides. On 4 April 2019 Michael D. Higgins, the President of Ireland, appointed her to his Council of State. Burke was a part of the Finding Power collection by Joe Caslin displayed in the National Gallery of Ireland. Burke appeared on the long-running BBC Radio 4 programme Desert Island Discs (hosted by Lauren Laverne) on Sunday 17 May 2020.

She specializes in infant development, especially with regard to the impact of maternal postpartum depression on mother-infant interaction and the efficacy of massage and touch therapy in promoting growth and emotional well being in premature and low birth weight infants. Field received the American Psychological Association Boyd McCandless Award for distinguished early career contributions to developmental psychology in 1979. In 2014, Field became the first psychologist to receive the Golden Goose Award for federally funded research on infant massage, an honor she shared with Saul Schanberg, Cynthia Kuhn, and Gary Evoniuk who established the beneficial effects of massage on growth in studies of rat pups. Field is an author whose books include The Amazing Infant, Infancy, Touch, Touch Therapy, Complementary and Alternative Therapies Research, and Massage Therapy Research, as well as edited volumes.  Biography  Field attended the University of Cincinnati, where she studied Psychology and completed her bachelor's degree in 1963. She continued her education at Tufts University, earning a master's degree in Occupational Therapy in 1965 and a second master's degree in Child Studies in 1973. Field subsequently attended the University of Massachusetts Amherst and graduated with a PhD in Developmental Psychology in 1976. After a year as a visiting professor at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, Field joined the faculty of the Mailman Center for Child Development at the University of Miami Medical School in 1977. She has remained at the University of Miami Medical School throughout her career with a joint appointment to the Fielding Graduate University. Field's research has been supported by grants from the National Institutes of Health (Senior Research Scientist Award), the National Institute of Mental Health (Research Scientist Development Award; Merit Award), the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, National Institute on Drug Abuse, the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine, the United States Department of Health & Human Services Administration on Children, Youth and Families, the March of Dimes, Johnson & Johnson, and Gerber corporations.  Research on the Benefits of Touch  Field is best known for her research on the effectiveness of massage therapy for stimulating growth in preterm infants. In one of her studies, premature infants received tactile/kinesthetic stimulation, consisting of body stroking and passive movements of the limbs, 3 times per day for 15 minutes over a 10-day period. These infants showed greater weight gain, were more active and alert, and were discharged from the hospital on average of six days earlier than a control group of premature infants who were not massaged. Other research has focused on how massage during pregnancy and labor benefits the mother by decreasing levels of the stress hormone cortisol. In one study, pregnant women who received massage therapy for five weeks reported less anxiety, depression and leg and back pain than a control group who received relaxation therapy. Extending her research on the benefits of touch to treatments for pain, Field and her colleagues conducted research demonstrating that regular massages (15 minutes a day for 30 days) reduced pain among children suffering from rheumatoid arthritis when compared with a control group receiving relaxation therapy. Other work demonstrated similar benefits for adults suffering arthritis pain. In research focusing on the use of alternative therapies with elderly individuals, Field and her colleagues have demonstrated benefits of movement therapy, massage, yoga, and tai chi.

Horsehair worms are obligate parasites that pass through different hosts at various stages. These worms can grow up to 90 cm long and can be extremely dangerous for their host, especially the praying mantis.  Morphology  Chordodes formosanus is morphologically similar to Chordodes japonensis. Both species have the same six cuticular structures of areoles on the surface, the significantly longer filaments on the female crowned areoles. Female horsehair appears to have a round and slightly swollen posterior end of their body, while males have a narrowed end.  Life cycle  # Chordates formosanus starts as a larva in the gut of the small insects that the mantis preys on. # Once the mantis ingests the infected insect, the C. formosanus starts to grow. # When it is mature, the worm secretes proteins that take over the host's nervous system, which directs the mantis to a body of water and causes it to jump in so that the worm can be excreted. At which point it breaks free to reproduce leaving a half empty mantis husk.  Host specificity  The definitive host range of horsehair worms is limited one or few species. Because nematomorphs are sometimes found after they have emerged from their host, definitive information on hosts is unknown in some species.  Geographic range  This horsehair worm parasite is prominent in Japan and Taiwan. Reproductively, they are dioecious, with the internal fertilization of eggs that are then laid in gelatinous strings. Adults have cylindrical gonads, opening into the cloaca. The larvae have rings of cuticular hooks and terminal stylets that are believed to be used to enter the hosts. Once inside the host, the larvae live inside the haemocoel and absorb nutrients directly through their skin. Development into the adult form takes weeks or months, and the larva moults several times as it grows in size  References  Category:Nematomorpha ","title":"Chordodes formosanus"},{"id":"56027332","text":"The 1994 Asian Acrobatic Gymnastics Championships were the second edition of the Asian Acrobatic Gymnastics Championships, and were held in Shenzhen, China, in April 1994.Hangzhou - Acrobatic Gymnastics Championships (in Chinese)Sports - Sichuan (in Chinese) Medal summary { -    Unknown  Unknown } References A Category:Asian Gymnastics Championships Category:International gymnastics competitions hosted by China ","title":"1994 Asian Acrobatic Gymnastics Championships"},{"id":"56027359","text":"Yenimahalle is an underground station on the M3 line of the Istanbul Metro in Baƒücƒ±lar, Istanbul.

This species usually infects pinnipeds; the semi-aquatic fin-footed marine mammals most commonly known as seals and sea lions. Pinniped infections are not exclusive, recently C. australe has been discovered in Magellanic penguins.

Revista Brasileira de Parasitologia Veterin√°ria, 28(3), 346-359. Epub June 13, 2019.https://dx.doi.org/10.1590/s1984-29612019031 This species follows a biological life cycle similar to many other of the same phylum. Starting with eggs being released in the feces of the host from a mature female, the eggs are then ingested by an arthropod, the parasite's first intermediate host. typically for C. australe the first host is an amphipod, a relatively small (usually less than 10 millimeters) shrimp-like crustacean. Within the crustacean a spindle-shaped embryo is released from the eggs and then subsequently develops into an acanthella, the juvenile infective form of an acanthocephalan. The acanthella then moves into the body cavity via the gut wall, encysts within and begins developing into the infective form known as a cystacanth. When the first intermediate host is consumed, either by its definitive host or by a paratenic host, the parasitic worm is released. Once within the definitive host, the cystacanth becomes an adult, encysts, then pierces the gut wall after its proboscis has been everted. Once through the gut wall it sexually matures by developing its sexual organs after feeding. After sexual maturation, the adult worms mate, the embryos develop within the female and the life cycle repeats. In contrast, within a paratenic host like a fish, the parasitic worm just forms a cyst.  Magellanic penguin infection  Fish serve as a paratenic host to the Corynosoma australe parasite given that their infection by the parasitic worm is not necessary for the success of the parasite's life cycle. Nonetheless, paratenic hosts such as fish are still important because they allow the parasite access to a variety of hosts given many animals eat fish as their primary food source, in this case Magellanic penguins. Since penguins typically consume the same food as seals and sea lion it became apparent how penguins acquire a parasitic infection endemic to pinnipeds. Likewise, since seals and sea lions share a comparable physiological similarity with penguins, cross species infection is more than possible. Though, C. australe can only produce viable eggs from within the pinniped host. C. australe can survive perfectly well within the penguins as its host, with female worms growing bigger within the guts of Magellanic penguins. In addition, though C. australe can survive well within Magellanic penguins, egg viability is lessened within this non-native host. Likewise, the sex ratio of the parasitic worm is highly skewed toward females within the gut of the penguins as the host. Though Magellanic penguins are not the definitive host of C. australe, they serve well as a suitable candidate.

My Life with Frank Zappa is a 2011 book by British author Pauline Butcher, which is an account of the four years (1967‚Äì1971) she worked as the secretary to rock and roll musician Frank Zappa. Butcher was a 21-year-old secretary whose firm sent her to type up the lyrics from Zappa‚Äôs second album, ‚ÄòAbsolutely Free‚Äô, for the London free newspaper, International Times. After arriving in California, Butcher first helped Zappa work on a book on politics, helped manage a group of female musicians Zappa founded, and managed the correspondence with his fans. When, in 2008, Butcher began to write her memoir, she used as source material the detailed letters to her mother who had kept them in a shoe-box for 40 years. Her mother had stored a box full of letters Butcher wrote from California. Reviewers asserted that Butcher brought a different perspective to the study of Zappa's work than other members of Zappa's entourage. A review in Critics at large described Butcher as a \\"a cultured and fashionable secretary out of Swinging London,\\" and characterized her book as \\"a reverse of Pygmalion\\". Jim Caligiuri, writing in the Austin Chronicle, concluded his review with \\"Offering deeply personal glimpses of Zappa, Butcher's coming-of-age story is so captivating and vividly told that many will be surprised to discover it's her first book.\\" According to Deborah Orr of The Guardian, the book \\"captures a particularly intense experience of a very brief, yet enormously influential, period in the evolution of western womanhood ... the interstitial time between sexual liberation and women's liberation\\". The Telegraph published an excerpt from the book. During an interview, in 2012, Butcher described taking the advice of a writing mentor, at the BBC, who had told her to \\"write something that no one else could write.\\". She had worked to develop a script for a series based on her time with Zappa, only to learn that the BBC had approved a documentary on Zappa, to be hosted by Germaine Greer. When she was advised the BBC would not fund two Zappa projects, she decided to use her research in a book. In 2014 BBC Radio adapted the book into a radio drama.

Description and history The South Dakota Department of Transportation Bridge No. 63-052-030 is located in northwestern Turner County, about north of Marion and west. It is a single-span Warren pony truss structure, carrying 271st Street across the West Branch of the Vermilion River. The trusses rest on rubblestone abutments, with flared wingwalls on both sides. The trusses span , and are assembled with rivets and bolts. Steel I-beams bolted to the truss bottom chords via gusset plates carry heavy timber stringers, over which the wooden roadway deck is laid. The bridge was built in 1913 by the Federal Bridge Company of Des Moines, Iowa. The county had a contract with that company to provide its steel truss bridges between 1912 and 1925, apparently as part of a common but illegal practice of \\"pooling\\", in which companies divided the state into areas where they did not compete against one another. Of the ten surviving Federal Bridge Company bridges surveyed in the county in the late 1990s, this one is the longest.

This is regarded as a notable achievement. This list is a compilation of total five-wicket hauls taken by international cricketers, split between different formats and presents a good view to compare performance of bowlers in all 3 formats of the game that are played at an international level. Test cricket is the longest form of the sport of cricket and is considered its highest standard for both batsmen and bowlers. Today, Test matches are scheduled to be played across five consecutive days. Bowlers have no limit on the number of overs that they can bowl. Also, since each team can potentially play two innings, bowlers of each team get the opportunity to bowl at the opposition twice. The first officially recognised Test match took place on 15‚Äì19 March 1877 and was played between England and Australia at the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG). One Day International (ODI) cricket is a form of limited overs cricket, played between two teams with international status, in which each team faces a fixed number of overs, usually 50. Bowlers are allowed a maximum of 10 overs in ODI cricket. The first ODI was played on 5 January 1971 between Australia and England at the MCG. Twenty20 International (T20I) cricket is a form of limited overs cricket, played between two of the international members of the International Cricket Council (ICC), in which each team faces twenty overs. Bowlers are allowed a maximum of 4 overs in T20I cricket. The first Twenty20 International match between two men's sides was played on 17 February 2005, involving Australia and New Zealand. In December 2018 in the 2nd T20I against West Indies, Shakib became the eighth cricketer to take at least one five wicket-haul in all three formats who is currently at 24th position in this list.

The first player to record a five-wicket haul in a Test innings was Australian Billy Midwinter in the second innings of the first Test cricket match ever played. The opponents were England. In the same match, two other players - Alfred Shaw of England and Australian Tom Kendall also recorded five-wicket hauls. Nasim- ul-Ghani is the youngest player to record five-wicket haul, at 16 years and 303 days. Bert Ironmonger is the oldest player to record five-wicket haul, capturing two five-wicket hauls in a match at 49 years and 311 days. Two cricketers - Jim Laker and Anil Kumble hold the distinction of taking all 10 wickets in the innings. In the same match where Jim Laker took all wickets in the innings, he captured 19 wickets in the match, the most wickets ever captured by a bowler in a Test match. By December 2018, 150 cricketers had taken five-wicket hauls on Test debut five-wicket haul on debut in a Test match. Of these, nine cricketers have taken two five-wicket hauls on their Test debut, including four from England, two from Australia and one each from India, South Africa and the West Indies. Dennis Lillee recorded the first five-wicket haul in ODI cricket, taking 5 wickets for 34 runs in 12 overs against Pakistan at Headingley in 1975. Chaminda Vaas has the best haul in ODIs, taking 8 wickets for 19 runs against Zimbabwe in 2001 in Colombo. Mujeeb Ur Rahman (16 years 325 days) and Sunil Dhaniram (39 years and 256 days) are the current record holders for youngest and oldest cricketers to record a five-wicket haul in ODI cricket. By December 2018, 13 five-wicket hauls have been taken by players on their ODI debut. Umar Gul recorded the first five- wicket haul in T20Is, taking 5 wickets for 6 runs in 3 overs against New Zealand at The Oval in 2009. Ajantha Mendis has the best haul in T20I taking 6 wickets for 8 runs against Zimbabwe at Hambantota in 2012. Rashid Khan (18 years 171 days) and Imran Tahir (37 years 327 days) are the current record holders for youngest and oldest cricketers to record a five-wicket haul in T20I cricket. Muthiah Muralitharan has the highest number of five-wicket hauls, with 77 across Test and ODI cricket. His haul of 67 five-wicket hauls is the highest in Test cricket. With 13 five-wicket hauls, Waqar Younis holds the highest number of five-wicket hauls in ODI cricket. 6 players - Umar Gul, Ajantha Mendis, Lasith Malinga, Tim Southee, Imran Tahir and Bhuvneshwar Kumar have taken at least one five-wicket haul in every format. Ajantha Mendis and Umar Gul are the only cricketers with multiple five-wicket hauls in all formats of the game. They also have the joint distinction of the most T20I five-wicket hauls. To date, 48 cricketers have taken 15 or more five-wicket hauls and 26 of whom went on to take 20 or more five-wicket hauls. Nine players have taken 30 or more five-wicket hauls in their international career across the three formats. { class=\\" plainrowheaders sortable\\" center\\" +Most five-wicket hauls in men's cricket ! scope=\\"col\\"  Rank ! scope=\\"col\\"  Player ! scope=\\"col\\"  Period ! scope=\\"col\\"  Teams ! scope=\\"col\\" data-sort-type=\\"number\\"  Test ! scope=\\"col\\" data-sort- type=\\"number\\"  ODI ! scope=\\"col\\" data-sort-type=\\"number\\"  T20I ! scope=\\"col\\"  Total ! scope=\\"col\\" data-sort-type=\\"number\\"  10 wickets in a match - 1 ! scope=\\"row\\" ffb\\"Muttiah Muralitharan^ 1992‚Äì2011 align=left/Asia/ICC 67 10 0 77 22 - 2 ! scope=\\"row\\" ffb\\"Richard Hadlee^ 1973‚Äì1990 align=left 36 5  41 9 - 3 ! scope=\\"row\\" ffb\\" Shane Warne^ 1992‚Äì2007 align=left/ICC 37 1  38 10 - 4 ! scope=\\"row\\" ffb\\" Anil Kumble^ 1990‚Äì2008 align=left/Asia 35 2  37 8 - 5 ! scope=\\"row\\" ffb\\"Glenn McGrath^ 1993‚Äì2007 align=left/ICC 29 7 0 36 3 -  rowspan=\\"2\\" 6 ! scope=\\"rowRangana Herath 1999‚Äì2018 align=left 34 0 1 35 9 - ! scope=\\"row\\" ffb\\"Waqar Younis^ 1989‚Äì2003 align=left 22 13  35 5 -  rowspan=\\"2\\" 8 ! scope=\\"row\\" ffb\\"Wasim Akram^ 1985‚Äì2002 align=left 25 6  31 5 - ! scope=\\"row\\" cfecec\\"James Anderson «Ç 2003‚Äì2020 align=left 29 2 0 31 3 -  rowspan=\\"1\\" 10 ! scope=\\"row\\" cfecec\\"Dale Steyn «Ç 2004‚Äì2019 align=left/Africa 26 3 0 29 5 -  rowspan=\\"1\\" 11 ! scope=\\"row\\" Harbhajan Singh 1998‚Äì2016 align=left/Asia 25 3 0 28 5 -  rowspan=\\"2 12 ! scope=\\"row\\" cfecec\\"Ravichandran Ashwin «Ç 2011‚Äì2020 align=left 27 0 0 27 7 - ! scope=\\"row\\" ffb\\"Ian Botham^ 1977‚Äì1992 align=left 27 0  27 4 - 14 ! scope=\\"row\\" ffb\\"Curtly Ambrose^ 1988‚Äì2000 align=left 22 4  26 3 -  rowspan=\\"4\\" 15 ! scope=\\"row\\" ffb\\"Sydney Barnes^ 1901‚Äì1914 align=left 24   24 7 - ! scope=\\"row\\" ffb\\" Dennis Lillee^ 1971‚Äì1984 align=left 23 1  24 7 - ! scope=\\"row\\" ffb\\"Imran Khan^ 1971‚Äì1992 align=left 23 1  24 6 - ! scope=\\"row\\" ffb\\"Kapil Dev^ 1978‚Äì1994 align=left 23 1  24 2 - 19 ! scope=\\"row\\" ffb\\"Courtney Walsh^ 1984‚Äì2001 align=left 22 1  23 3 -  rowspan=\\"4\\" 20 ! scope=\\"row\\" Allan Donald 1991‚Äì2003 align=left 20 2  22 3 - ! scope=\\"row\\" ffb\\"Malcolm Marshall^ 1978‚Äì1992 align=left 22 0  22 4 - ! scope=\\"row\\" Makhaya Ntini 1998‚Äì2011 align=left/ICC 18 4 0 22 4 - ! scope=\\"row\\" Daniel Vettori 1997‚Äì2015 align=left/ICC 20 2 0 22 3 -  rowspan=\\"3\\" 24 ! scope=\\"row\\" ffb\\"Clarrie Grimmett^ 1925‚Äì1936 align=left 21   21 7 - ! scope=\\"row\\" cfecec\\"Shakib Al Hasan «Ç 2006‚Äì2019 align=left 18 2 1 21 2 - ! scope=\\"row\\" Shaun Pollock 1996‚Äì2008 align=left/Africa/ICC 16 5 0 21 1 -  rowspan=\\"1\\"  27 ! scope=\\"row\\" cfecec\\" Mitchell Starc «Ç 2010‚Äì2020 align=left 13 7 0 20 2 -  rowspan=\\"3\\" 28 ! scope=\\"row\\" Saqlain Mushtaq 1995‚Äì2004 align=left 13 6  19 3 - ! scope=\\"row\\" Brett Lee 1999‚Äì2012 align=left 10 9 0 19 0 - ! scope=\\"row\\" cfecec\\" Stuart Broad «Ç 2007‚Äì2020 align=left 18 1 0 19 3 -  rowspan=\\"3\\" 31 ! scope=\\"row\\" Graeme Swann 2008‚Äì2013 align=left 17 1 0 18 3 - ! scope=\\"row\\" ffb\\"Lance Gibbs^ 1958‚Äì1976 align=left 18 0  18 2 - ! scope=\\"row\\" cfecec\\" Nathan Lyon «Ç 2011‚Äì2020 align=left 18 0 0 18 3 -  rowspan=\\"4\\" 34 ! scope=\\"row\\" ffb\\"Fred Trueman^ 1952‚Äì1965 align=left 17   17 3 - ! scope=\\"row\\" Abdul Qadir 1977‚Äì1993 align=left 15 2  17 5 - ! scope=\\"row\\" ffb\\"Derek Underwood^ 1966‚Äì1982 align=left 17 0  17 6 - ! scope=\\"row\\" cfecec\\" Yasir Shah «Ç 2011‚Äì2020 align=left 16 1 0 17 3 -  rowspan=\\"7\\" 38 ! scope=\\"row\\" Terry Alderman 1981‚Äì1991 align=left 14 2  16 1 - ! scope=\\"row\\" BS Chandrasekhar 1964‚Äì1979 align=left 16 0  16 2 - ! scope=\\"row\\" Shoaib Akhtar 1998‚Äì2011 align=left/Asia/ICC 12 4 0 16 2 - ! scope=\\"row\\" Graham McKenzie 1961‚Äì1971 align=left 16   16 3 - ! scope=\\"row\\" ffb\\"Richie Benaud^ 1952‚Äì1964 align=left 16   16 1 - ! scope=\\"row\\" Bob Willis 1971‚Äì1984 align=left 16 0  16 0 - ! scope=\\"row\\" Chaminda Vaas 1994‚Äì2009 align=left/Asia 12 4 0 16 2 -  rowspan=\\"4\\" 45 ! scope=\\"row\\" Alec Bedser 1946‚Äì1955 align=left 15   15 5 - ! scope=\\"row\\" Danish Kaneria 2000‚Äì2010 align=left 15 0  15 2 - ! scope=\\"row\\" Craig McDermott 1984‚Äì1996 align=left 14 1  15 2 - ! scope=\\"row\\" Mitchell Johnson 2007‚Äì2015 align=left 12 3 0 15 3 } Last updated: 26 July 2020  Women's cricket  The first player to record a five-wicket haul in a Test innings was England's Myrtle Maclagan in the first innings of the first Test match ever played. The opponents were Australia. In the same match, two other players - Australian Anne Palmer and England's Mary Spear also recorded five-wicket hauls. India's Neetu David holds the distinction of taking the highest number of wickets in Test innings - 8 wickets against England at Jamshedpur in 1995. In the same match where Jim Laker captured all wickets in the innings, he captured 19 wickets in the match, the most wickets ever captured by a bowler in a Test match. As of December 2018, 13 cricketers have taken five-wicket hauls on Test debut five- wicket haul on debut in a Test match. Tina Macpherson and Glenys Page recorded the first five-wicket haul in Women's One Day International cricket (WODI) taking 5/14 and 6/20 against Young England and Trinidad and Tobago on 23 June 1973 - the first day of the inaugural Women's Cricket World Cup. Sajjida Shah has the best haul in WODI cricket, taking 7 wickets for 4 runs against Japan in 2003 in Amsterdam. Macpherson and Page are two of only five players to take a five-wicket haul during their WODI debut, the others being India's Purnima Choudhary, Laura Harper of England and Felicity Leydon-Davis from New Zealand. The first five-wicket haul in a Women's Twenty20 International (WT20I) match was taken by New Zealand's Amy Satterthwaite against England on 16 August 2007. Satterthwaite took six wickets for 17 runs, the first six-wicket haul in the international format. The best bowling figures in an innings was taken by Botswana's's Botsogo Mpedi who returned figures of 6 for 8 against Lesotho during the Botswana 7s tournament in Gaborone in August 2018. Mpedi is also the only bowler to take a five-wicket haul on WT20I debut. , Anisa Mohammed has the most five-wicket hauls in Women's cricket. Her 8 five-wicket hauls have come in WODI and WT20I cricket and she has not played Test cricket.

In 2017, Forbes published a feature on Monahan, promoting his innovative outlook on technology. That same year, ABC News reported on his large-scale public installation in Los Angeles where he painted three residential homes bright pink as a commentary on class, community and digital legacy. Monahan's \\"#selfiewall\\" in the Venice Beach neighborhood in Los Angeles was dubbed by Los Angeles Magazine as being \\"The Most Instagramable Wall in L.A.\\" and ABC's Nightline said his art is an \\"instagramer's dream.\\"  Early History  Before creating the group, \\"The Most Famous Artist,\\" Monahan attended Stanford University and had a career in advertising technology. He co-founded Sharethrough in San Francisco in 2007, a software company that offered publishers and brand marketers a platform for native monetization. In 2012, Monahan relocated to Los Angeles and became the CEO of AlphaBoost, a social advertising startup company. The following year, he was vacationing in India with Jesse Thomas, founder of a social media strategy firm, when Thomas posted photos and video of Monahan drunk and nude to his personal and company social media accounts. The incident jeopardized Alphaboost acquisition talks that Mohanan was involved in.  \\"The Most Famous Artist\\"  Monahan launched his platform, \\"The Most Famous Artist,\\" in 2013 when he began taking preexisting paintings and adding something to them or painting over their surface. This concept of appropriation is a longstanding one in art history and was used by iconic artists such as Marcel Duchamp and Andy Warhol. Mohanan, however, adds an awareness of digital promotion and social media to this technique that modernizes its impact.  \\"100 Thousand Dollars,\\" 2016  In 2016, Mohanan created ten works, each one resembling a stack of one thousand $100 bills; however, only the bills on the top and bottom of the stacks were visible making their literal monetary value a mystery. The stacks were priced at $5,000 each and the first sold within twenty minutes of being posted on Instagram. While buyers could look through the stacks of cash to count their actual monetary value, Mohanan added a seal to each piece that keeps all the bills together and said it will become an illegitimate art object should that seal be broken.  \\"The Pink House\\" (2017)  In 2017, \\"The Most Famous Artist\\" group painted three houses in a Los Angeles residential neighborhood bright pink that were scheduled for demolition and to be replaced by a high-end apartment building. The installation was embraced on social media but also seen as an important lens on gentrification and community displacement.  \\"Artificial Intelligence: THE END OF ART AS WE KNOW IT\\", 2017  In 2017, the group mounted a solo exhibition at The McLoughlin Gallery in San Francisco where they partnered with anonymous hackers to build an artificial intelligence capable of analyzing and reproducing art styles of iconic artists, such as Chuck Close. The first group of images is a series of portraits of people, including: factory workers, art dealers, pilots, artists and taxi drivers, whose jobs could one day by eliminated by artificial intelligence. This exhibition serves as starting point for a discussion about the challenges facing humanity in light of big data, AI and robots. In 2019, one of the artworks from this exhibition, an AI-created portrait of Mark Zuckerberg, was featured on the cover of Rotman Management Magazine.  \\"The Private Jet Experience,\\" 2018  Simulating the experience of flying on a luxury private jet, the group built an interactive installation that, when photographed from a particular angle, makes participants appear to be on a luxury Gulfstream G3. The purpose of the experience is entirely for social media optics, an approach Forbes called \\"brilliantly outrageous.\\" The work was installed in the Fred Segal store in Los Angeles and is set to travel around the country, including Miami Beach during Art Basel in 2018.  \\"The Fyre Experience,\\" 2019  As homage to the Fyre Festival in 2017, The Most Famous Artist built a selfie-centric installation satirizing the failed music event. The installation recreated infamous details from Fyre Festival as possible: cardboard cutouts of celebrities who endorsed the festival, cheese sandwiches in polystyrene containers, stacks of fake money, a simulated hot tub full of Evian bottles and a sandy beach with a Bahamas background. Also in 2019, Hulu and Netflix each released documentaries on the failure, Fyre Fraud and Fyre: The Greatest Party That Never Happened, which partially inspired this project.  \\"Matty Marries Miley,\\" 2019  Nearing the one-year anniversary of Miley Cyrus's short lived marriage to Liam Hemsworth, Monahan proposed to Cyrus on social media--a stunt to amplify his credibility as a performance artist. Cyrus publicly responded to the post, saying ‚Äúit probably won‚Äôt last long, but always down to try. You miss 100% of the shots you don‚Äôt take.‚Äù  Public Speaking  In 2016, Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art's Artinfusion Insight program hosted Monahan to speak about his innovative use of social media in his art and, in 2017, he delivered lectures at Sotheby's Institute of Art and at the Tech Open Air conference in Berlin.  ABC's Nightline, 2019  ABC News produced the video, \\"Meet Matty Mo, 'The Most Famous Artist' you've never heard of,\\" the most comprehensive account of Monahan's platform and art to date. In the interview, Monahan discusses the integral role the internet plays in his installations but also the ways in which he is inspired by, and further extends, concepts derived from art history. Specifically, Monahan explores art monetization in a manner similar to Kaws, participatory installations similar to Yayoi Kusama, and headlines and stunts to broaden his message similar to Banksy's approach.

Assessing spirituality  Asking patients questions about the meaning of life, their acceptance of their own or others' failures, and how they experience connectedness with others should have the goal of assessing how satisfied the patient is with the answers to these questions.Potter, Mertie L., and Mary D. Moller. Psychiatric mental health nursing: from suffering to hope. Boston, Pearson, 2016. By developing personal relationships with their patients and their families, health professionals can better assess patients' spiritual situation.Wright, L. (2005). Spirituality, Suffering, Illness. Philadelphia, PA: F.A. Davis, p. xviii. Some examples of opening questions in a spiritual assessment are as follows:Potter, Mertie L., and Mary D. Moller. Psychiatric mental health nursing: from suffering to hope. Boston, Pearson, 2016. * \\"Do you have a religious preference?\\" * \\"Are there any spiritual or religious practices that are important to you?\\" * \\"Would you like for us to contact your clergy member or religious advisor?\\". Role of spirituality in illness The prospect of death may lead a patient to deal with questions related to meaning of life, such as \\"Why is this happening to me?\\" or \\"Is there a God?\\" Self-care Li and Shun (2016) focused on self care coping styles in patients with chronic heart failure found that spiritual and religious support affects heart failure patients coping with both physical and psychological self-care. Applications in health care Third-party professional aid Ill individuals and their families may request referrals for services such as a chaplain, psychologist, or social worker who can address their spiritual concerns. Providers who are uncomfortable accommodating an integrative approach to care should consult with other practitioners skilled in providing spiritual care, so that patients can integrate spiritual support into their own self-care. The results showed that spiritual intelligence training had a positive effect on nurses‚Äô competence in spiritual care. Also, 89% of the nurses who participated in the study had not been given any prior education regarding spiritual care. Nurses considered barriers to spiritual care including inadequate staff, cultural differences, high workload and lack of education on this subject.The development of spiritual care provided by nurses can result in various outcomes such as increased satisfaction with care in patients, reduced anxiety and symptoms of depression during hospitalization, reduced length of hospitalization and, in general, improved quality of life.

He is the CEO of Two Oak Ventures (formerly Precourt Sports Ventures), a group that owns future Major League Soccer club Austin FC and formerly owned the Columbus Crew SC, an MLS soccer organization. He is also a managing partner of Precourt Capital Management, a private investment management firm based in San Francisco, California. Education and career Precourt was raised in Denver, Colorado, and went to high school in Connecticut. He graduated from Pepperdine University with a Bachelor of Arts in political science and from the Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth College with a Master of Business Administration. Precourt entered the corporate finance business with stints at Merrill Lynch, Alex. Brown & Sons, and WHV Investment Management. He then started his own private equity firm, Precourt Capital Management, in 2008, focusing on the energy sector. MLS ownership Precourt, who had a stated interest in soccer, formed Precourt Sports Ventures LLC in 2012 and looked to invest in Major League Soccer. The firm bought the Columbus Crew SC from Clark Hunt for $68 million, then a record for a MLS franchise. At the first Crew match he attended, several months before the sale was finalized, the scoreboard at Mapfre Stadium caught fire and delayed kickoff for hours. Under Precourt's ownership, the Crew hired Gregg Berhalter as its manager and first sporting director; and unveiled an updated brand identity that included a new logo and name with the suffix \\"SC\\". On October 17, 2017, Precourt Sports Ventures announced that it was considering moving the franchise in 2019 to Austin, Texas. The move came as a surprise to Columbus leaders and fans. After offering an apology on Twitter, Precourt was the focus of anger from the team's supporters, culminating in the establishment of the Save the Crew movement. In December 2018, Precourt Sports Ventures announced they had negotiated an agreement with the City of Austin to build a $242 million stadium on public land at 10414 McKalla Place, following an evaluation of several other city-owned properties. Construction began in 2019 and the stadium is expected to be ready in the spring of 2021. On January 1, 2019, ownership of Crew SC was preliminarily transferred from Precourt Sports Ventures to a group composed of Dee and Jimmy Haslam and Dr. Pete Edwards, who pledged to keep the Crew in Columbus and build a new stadium in downtown Columbus. Austin FC was officially announced as the 27th MLS franchise on January 15, 2019 and is set to begin play in 2021. Precourt Sports Ventures was rebranded as Two Oak Ventures in July 2019, with Precourt remaining as CEO, and six Austin-based owners were added the following month. He is currently involved in a public relations battle with Bobby Epstein, chairman of another local soccer team Austin Bold FC and an investor in the Circuit of the Americas. Epstein has been criticized for his tactics in attempting to stop Precourt's plans of building a stadium in Austin, including hiring petition campaigners who are accused of lying to the public. Personal life Precourt lives in San Francisco, California, with his wife Agatha and three children. His father is Jay Precourt, a former oil executive. He also owns a home in Austin, Texas.

The surface of the Nicobi River is generally frozen from early December to late April. Forestry is the main economic activity of the sector; recreational tourism activities, second. Forest roads R1015 (North- South) and R1051 (East-West) are closest to the South side of the Nicobi River Valley. While the North side is served by road 113 which connects Lebel-sur- Qu√©villon to Chibougamau.  Geography  The hydrographic slopes adjacent to the Nicobi River are: *North side: Lichen Lake (Opawica River), Opawica River, Wachigabau Lake; *East side: Lichen Lake (Opawica River), Margry Creek, Germain Creek; *South side: Nicobi Lake, Wetetnagami River; *West side: O'Sullivan River, Malouin Lake, Pusticamica Lake, Opawica River. The Nicobi River originated in Eeyou Istchee James Bay (municipality), at the mouth of Nicobi Lake (length: ; maximum width: ; altitude: ). This lake is mainly fed by the South with the waters of the Wetetnagami River. The southeast shore of the lake has a swamp area. The mouth of the lake is located on the northwest shore, near an island of in length. The course of the Nicobi River flows northward across some areas of marsh and through several sets of rapids into its lower half. The Nicobi River flows on the southeastern shore of Lichen Lake which is crossed to the southwest by the Opawica River.Segments of the river measured from the Atlas of Canada (published on the Internet) of the Department of Natural Resources Canada. The course of the latter flows westward and successively crosses the northern portion of Lake Waswanipi, Go√©land Lake (Waswanipi River) and Olga Lake (Waswanipi River), before entering Matagami Lake which in turn flows into the Nottaway River, a tributary of the Rupert Bay (James Bay). The confluence of the Nicobi River with the Opawica River is located at: * Southeast of route 113; * East of Lake Waswanipi; * East of downtown Matagami; * Northeast of the village center of Lebel-sur-Qu√©villon; * Northwest of the venter of village Obedjiwan (Indian Reserve).

DNA and Family Resemblance Across Generations In psychology, the similarities of personality are also observed. Genetics Heritability, defined as a measure of family resemblance, causes traits to be genetically passed from parents to offspring (heredity), allowing evolutionarily advantageous traits to persist through generations. Despite sharing parents, siblings do not inherit identical genes, making studies on identical twins (who have identical DNA) especially effective at analyzing the role genetics play in phenotypic similarity. Studies have found that generational resemblance of many phenotypic traits results from the inheritance of multiples genes that collectively influence a trait (additive genetic variance). There is evidence of heritability in personality traits. For example, one study found that approximately half of personality differences in high-school aged fraternal and identical twins were due to genetic variation - and another study suggests that no one personality trait is more heritable than another. Environment Family resemblance is also shaped by environmental factors, temperature, light, nutrition, exposure to drugs, the time that different family members spend in shared and non-shared environments, are examples of factors found to influence phenotype. Phenotypes found to be largely environmentally determined in humans include personality, height, and weight. Twin studies have shown that more than half of the variation in a few major aspects of personality are environmentally determined, and that environmental factors even affect traits like immune response and how children handle stress. Additionally, anomalous findings, such as second-degree relatives of alcoholics, showing surprising similarities to them have led some researchers‚Äô attempts in generating better models that account for the environmental impacts on influences like cultural inheritance, family structure and head of household, which have been shown to influence family resemblance.

Louis XVI bought it in 1783 for his sister Elisabeth of France, known as Madame √âlisabeth.  History  Originally a seigneurie from the twelfth century, Montreuil hosted a fortress in 1375. The domain was annexed into the Royal Estates, and was ceded to the C√©lestins of Paris by Charles VI of France. It was later integrated into the domain of Versailles at the time of Louis XV. The source that feeds the ponds today made it a fashionable place where members of the Court built beautiful properties. Madame √âlisabeth Thus in 1772, the Prince of Rohan-Gu√©m√©n√© and his wife, known as Madame de Gu√©m√©n√© acquired the domain of Montreuil, which they enlarge to form a property of 8 hectares. The transformations of both the house and the gardens were entrusted to the architect Alexandre Louis √âtable de La Bri√®re. In 1783, following the scandalous bankruptcy of the Gu√©m√©n√©, Louis XVI bought the house for his younger sister Elisabeth. The Queen presented it to her with the words: \\"My sister, you are now at home. This place will be your Trianon.\\" Madame √âlisabeth remained here until 1789. From 1784 to 1789, the buildings were updated in the Neoclassical style by architect Jean-Jacques Huv√©, future mayor of Versailles (1792-1793).S. Chauffour, Jean-Jacques Huv√© (1742-1808), architecte : retour √† Palladio, Th√®se d'√âcole des Chartes, 2005. He rebuilt the main building on two levels (ground floor and first floor) in stone, contributed a horizontal roof and repaired the broken attic. This renovation included a circular chapel with zenith lighting as well as a Turkish boudoir. The furniture was commissioned to cabinetmaker Jean-Baptiste-Claude Sen√©. Pieces of this furniture are preserved today at the Louvre MuseumJean-Baptiste-Claude Sen√© (1748-1803), Paire de berg√®res \\"√† la Reine\\" (1789), Paris, Mus√©e du Louvre and at the Mus√©e Nissim de Camondo.Jean-Baptiste-Claude Sen√© (1748-1803), Paire de chaises voyeuses (1789), Paris, Mus√©e Nissim de Camondo The Orangery The closing wall, along the Avenue de Paris, crowned with a balustrade, served as a terrace from which one could admire the park and the eight-hectare garden landscaped by Huv√© in what was called Anglo-Chinese style (fake cave, watercourse, waterfall, bridge, etc.). Drawings by the architect, preserved in the Biblioth√®que nationale, the Carnavalet Museum and the Lambinet Museum, bear memory of this arrangement.S. Chauffour, op. cit. Madame Elisabeth established a small dispensary in a room of the house for the local poor. They were treated by the doctor and botanist Louis Guillaume Le Monnier, who brought rare plants to the garden of the estate. The Revolution put an end to these occupations. Having escaped fragmentation of the properties during the French Revolution, the Clausse family became proprietors during the early nineteenth century, Charles Louis Clausse, mayor of Versailles died on September 10, 1831. The buildings were heavily altered, undoubtedly under the Bourbon Restoration or July Monarchy, resulting in the configuration that we know today.  Modern era  During the 1920s, important restorations were carried out by the owner, Jean-Baptiste Chantrell. In 1955, his daughter Lydie sold the property to a real estate company. The house of Madame √âlisabeth belongs since 1984 to the General Council of Yvelines. The Orangery, acquired by the department in 1997, serves as a venue for temporary exhibitions.  Description  The current dwelling consists of a rectangular two-floor main building flanked by two pavilions. The facade is decorated with a peristyle with four columns. From the original design, only the part initially acquired by the Gu√©m√©n√© and three rooms of the apartments of Madame √âlisabeth remain: the room that was to be hers but where she never slept, the Turkish salon and the harpsichord room. Some decorations have been restored. In addition to the Orangery, the estate was bordered by a dairy farm and cowshed that are now lost. The orangery has been registered as a historic monument since 23 October 1980.

The non-profit organization was founded in 1962. The primary season is a seven-week summer classical music festival. Over 200 classical musicians from more than 90 different orchestras and 40 institutions of higher learning participate in the summer festival. The Festival presents family events, chamber music, classical crossover artists, and orchestral concerts. In recent years, the Festival has also included year- round experiences with Winter Festivals, The Met: Live in HD opera broadcasts, community concerts, and lectures. History The Grand Teton Music Festival was founded in 1962 initially as part of the Jackson Hole Fine Arts Festival. Conductors Ernest Hagen and George Hufsmith led the orchestra as music directors until 1968 when the Fine Arts Festival selected conductor Ling Tung as their successor. Maestro Tung moved the concerts from Jackson Lake Lodge and the Jackson High School gym (referred to as ‚ÄúSymphony Hall‚Äù) to a large tent at the base of Rendezvous Mountain in Teton Village. The Festival moved into a permanent structure at the base of Rendezvous Mountain in 1974. After Maestro Tung‚Äôs retirement in 1996, Eiji Oue served as music director from 1997 to 2003. For the 2004 and 2005 seasons, conductor Peter Oundjian served as the principal conductor and artistic advisor to the Festival. In 2006 conductor Donald Runnicles began his tenure as music director, a position he currently holds. A virtual event is planned for 2020.

Each summer, the music director leads four of the seven regular Festival Orchestra Concerts, and each concert features a soloist. The GTMF Presents Series offers a range of artists, all classically influenced, who perform in venues throughout Jackson Hole. The performances show different facets of the classical music genre by featuring visiting orchestral soloists in recital as well as popular musicians who have blended diverse styles.

His activism focuses on equal rights for LGBT people, ethical consumerism, and supporting liberal politicians. The Huffington Post characterized Juengling's work as \\"tech savvy queer activism.\\" He is a former contributing writer for PQ Monthly and GeeksOUT. He is the author of Jeb's ABCs, a satirical children's book based on Jeb Bush and Bush's stance on political issues. Early life and education Konrad Anders Juengling was born in 1987 in Salem, Oregon. He was raised a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. Juengling is the nephew of lighting director Dietrich Juengling. The LGBT publication Gay PV characterized the Juengling family as \\"involved in the arts\\". He is a collateral descendant of United States President Abraham Lincoln through Lincoln's great-grandfather John Lincoln. In February 2005, Juengling earned his Eagle Scout Award from the Boy Scouts of America; his project was removing graffiti from public parks and fences in Four Corners, Oregon. Because of the then-active BSA policy of not allowing gay youth to join, Juengling did not come out to any scouting leaders while in the Boy Scouts, though he did come out to other boys in his troop. Juengling attended North Salem High School, from which he graduated in 2005. While at North, he was a reporter for the student newspaper The Clarion. After graduating high school, Juengling attended university at Portland State University, where he earned a bachelor's degree in psychology. He moved to Boise to attend Boise State University to earn a Master's in Social Work, graduating in 2017. At Boise State, Juengling was the recipient of the Chinn LGBT Scholarship from the American Atheists. Activism Politics =Indiana's 2015 Religious Freedom Restoration Act bill= In March 2015, Indiana passed the Religious Freedom Restoration Act. The act was seen by some as discriminatory against LGBT and other minorities. In response, Juengling purchased the domain names of six Republican Indiana State House representatives and linked them to the Human Rights Campaign's Youth Statistics page. He stated the information on the site would educate the lawmakers about a population that \\"is already disadvantaged and have less accesses to family, community supports, and healthcare.\\" The domain names he purchased were for representatives Dale Devon, Don Lehe, Donna Schaibley, Douglas Gutwein, Kathy Kreag Richardson, and Martin Carbaugh. In an open letter to Indiana state representatives, Juengling offered to give them the domains in exchange for passing a non-discrimination policy. Juengling's efforts were supported by LGBT magazine The Advocate, Towleroad, and other media. The Huffington Post awarded Juengling with their \\"Unicorn of the Week\\" award for his efforts in combating the Indiana bill and \\"doing something positive for the LGBTQ community\\". As a response to Juengling's domain names purchase, writer Brian Anderson referred to him as an extortionist who \\"is holding [the domains] hostage until they bow to his will.\\" Young Conservatives writer Michael Cantrell also referred to Juengling as an extortionist, and someone who \\"lives to take [freedom] away.\\" Criticism also come from within the gay community, including Pink News, who stated \\"We could not possibly condone such a petty move.\\" =2016 presidential election= Juengling endorsed Hillary Clinton for the Democratic nomination for the United States 2016 presidential election. In response to Ted Cruz announcing his presidential bid, Juengling stated, \\"Despite having an abysmal attendance record on the Armed Services Committee, not recognizing our impact on climate change, and his insistence gays are waging a 'jihad' against Christians, Cruz believes he is the right man to lead the most powerful country in the free world... The reality of the situation is that a presidency under Cruz is a far fetched idea.\\" Juengling also created an Amazon wish list with gay items to be sent to Cruz's office as a form of protesting his candidacy. Following calling Cruz's chance at becoming the president a \\"far fetched idea\\", Juengling took also aim at Rick Perry. In an op-ed, Juengling brought up Perry not wanting federal oversight of the education system, not remembering the name of the third major agency he wanted to shut down during his 2012 presidential bid, and his federal indictment for abuse of official capacity and coercion of a public servant. After criticizing Cruz and Perry, Juengling wrote a book about Jeb Bush called Jeb's ABCs, a satirical children's book that called attention to Bush's political stands. The Huffington Post wrote the book \\"is actually genius.\\" In an interview with the Huffington Post Juengling stated, \\"I would like people to take away the realization that Jeb is a poor candidate and poor politician. He is unable to connect to minority voters, holds discriminatory views and believes homosexual people are ‚Äúsodomites.‚Äù I would like people to research into the quotes and policies covered in the book and see there's actually a lot more information out there.\\" The National Memo stated Jeb's ABCs \\"is a critically-lauded take-down of Jeb Bush's poor record on LGBTQ rights. ... though the nomination of Donald Trump wasn't much consolation.\\" =2018 Idaho gubernatorial election= In the 2018 Idaho gubernatorial election, Juengling endorsed Democrat Paulette Jordan over Republican Brad Little, citing Jordan's stance on LGBTQ rights, marriage equality, Medicaid expansion, clean energy, and abortion rights for women. The National Memo called Juengling's endorsement \\"a major LGBTQ endorsement.\\" In an interview with Gay Star News, Juengling stated he disagrees with Jordan on gun rights, stating he is \\"firmly in the gun control camp. I think Americans have an unhealthy fascination and obsession with firearms.\\" =2020 presidential election= In October 2018 Juengling stated he'd like to see Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, or Cory Booker make a presidential bid. In May 2019, he officially endorsed Harris, and stated a Harris-Pete Buttigieg ticket would be his \\"ideal.\\" He criticized Tulsi Gabbard, citing Gabbard's history on LGBTQ rights, record on Bashar al-Assad, and other positions she holds, but stated he would vote for whoever the Democratic nominee was. In September 2020, Juengling stated he was \\"75 percent confident [Democrats] will take the presidency. Trump's handling of the coronavirus, rampant unemployment, and his behavior over the last four years will drive people into the voting booth.\\" Animal rights Juengling has launched multiple petitions online relating to animal rights, including to ban the sale of foie gras online, and to outlaw trophy hunting imports within the United States. EuroNews stated Juengling is \\"particularly focused on animal rights activism\\" and has a \\"passion for animals\\". He does not support zoos, stating zoos \\"profit off the capture and containment of exotic animals that should be left in the wild.\\" Juengling is a supporter of Million Dollar Vegan, a charity campaign launched in February 2019 to get Pope Francis to go vegan for Lent. Positions  2019 Trump wall emergency  In 2019, President Donald Trump declared a National Emergency Concerning the Southern Border of the United States. Juengling does not believe the border wall should be considered a national emergency.  Global warming  Juengling believes global warming should be a national emergency. In February 2020, he stated, \\"...the United States is actively contributing to the problem rather than being the leader it could be. Global warming affects the entire planet and has already had permanent consequences on this earth... We have the opportunity to mitigate some of the damage currently happening and shift the focus to being responsible stewards of this planet rather than plundering it for shareholders.\\"  LGB Alliance  In 2019, the LGB Alliance, an association which claims to support lesbian, gay, and bisexual people's rights, launched in the UK. Juengling considers the organization a Trans exclusionary radical feminist group, stating, \\"I can‚Äôt support TERF organisations that use right-wing talking points to purposely exclude members of the community.\\" President Trump In September 2020, Juengling stated \\"Trump is the most divisive and unscrupulous president America has had. Other presidents don't hold a candle to Trump in terms of incompetence and surrounding themselves with sycophants and inept family members. Trump's interests lie in expanding his empire and growing his fortune. If he has to run America into the ground by appealing to racists, homophobes, and nationalists, he'll do it.\\"  Salvation Army  Juengling has stated that people should not donate to the Salvation Army based on their policies relating to homosexuals. In an op-ed for PQ Monthly, he stated \\"inequality is built into the very structure of the Salvation Army... the homophobia is literally written into its handbook.\\" Writing While attending Portland State University, Juengling was a paid columnist for the student newspaper the Daily Vanguard. His column, titled \\"Just a Phase\\", ran during late 2013. From 2013 to 2015, Juengling was a contributing writer for PQ Monthly, which is based out of Portland, Oregon. After writing an op-ed picked up by GeeksOUT, Juengling then joined the GeeksOUT team, writing posts about queer-related media for their site from September 2014 to April 2016. From December 2015 until the magazine closed in May 2016, Juengling wrote for OutBoise Magazine, a queer magazine based in Boise, Idaho. Opinion-editorials written by Juengling \\"helped to raise GeeksOUT's profile after their ‚ÄòSkip Ender's Game‚Äô campaign.\\" In April 2016, Juengling joined Emily Allen, Timothy \\"Tim\\" Jensen, Christy Schroeder, and Jenna Wiskus to write Boise Weekly to criticize Idaho's Bill 1321, which would allow the Bible to be used in public schools as instruction material. They stated Bill 1321 \\"blurs the lines between the separation of Church and State in Idaho Public Schools\\" and that it was \\"an alarming bill for several reasons\\". In June 2017, Juengling wrote an op-ed for the Times-News, titled \\"Idaho Needs Mandatory Sex Education\\", in which he argued, \\"Comprehensive sex education should also include LGBT health and topics as well. Lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender youth deserve to have information regarding their sexuality and health just like heterosexual and cisgender students.\\" The piece was also published in the Post Register under the headline \\"Mandatory sex ed in Idaho.\\" In September 2018, Juengling wrote a letter to the editor of the Idaho Press-Tribune about former Idaho Senator Marv Hagedorn making fun of sexual assault victims on his Twitter account earlier that week. The letter was titled \\"Making fun of sexual assault victims isn't funny.\\" A day later, he wrote another letter to the editor of the Meridian Press criticizing Meridian's mayor for abstaining from a potential tie-breaking vote when the city council voted on a non- discrimination ordinance for gender identity and sexual orientation. Juengling has also written op-eds on LGBT topics for the Q Center in Portland; The Washington Blade; GayRVA; QSaltLake and Purple Unions. Personal life Juengling initially met his husband Robert (n√© Peterson) on the gay social networking app Grindr. The two became engaged in 2015 at the Albuquerque International Balloon Fiesta. They married at Silver Falls State Park on August 20, 2016, where they were the first same-sex couple married at the lodge. An amateur genealogist, Juengling is a member of several genealogically focused groups. Among them are: Bloodlines of Salem, a lineage association for those related to people killed as witches during the Salem Witch Trials; the Dutch Colonial Society, a society for those who are a \\"direct descent from a Dutch settler born in the Netherlands, and, who immigrated, no later than 19 April 1775, to any settlement in what is now the United States\\"; and the Presidential Families of America, a lineage association for those related to United States Presidents and First Ladies. South African artist Gavin du Plessis painted a piece honoring Juengling, called Juengling in Hades. The piece was part of the Sanlam Art Collection in 2019. Juengling identifies as an atheist, environmentalist, feminist, liberal, and \\"sometimes vegan\\".

Built in 1927, Thomas House is one of three hotels remaining from the early-20th century resort boom at Red Boiling Springs. In 1986, it was added to the National Register of Historic Places along with the other two hotels, the Donoho Hotel and Counts Hotel. History The 1880s saw a boom in the development of mineral springs resorts as summer destinations, inspired by the success of Saratoga Springs, New York. Early in this decade, New York businessman James F. O. Shaughnessy purchased the Red Boiling Springs tract and began development of the area as a resort. To accommodate visitors attracted by the mineral springs, local general store owners Zack and Clay Cloyd built the Cloyd Hotel in 1890. This was a two-storey white weatherboard structure with long two storey verandas, similar to the Donoho Hotel that still stands today. The original Cloyd Hotel was destroyed by fire in 1924, and the current two- storey red brick hotel with portico was built in 1927. A second fire in the 1990s destroyed one wing, which was also rebuilt. Haunting The Thomas House in 2010. The hotel gained notoriety in the early half of the 2010s when it became the subject of several television programs investigating paranormal activity, including the SyFy channel television program Ghost Hunters. Ghost hunts have since remained a popular tourist attraction for the town. Room 37 is claimed to be the center of the activity. One ghost is said to be the spirit of Sarah Cloyd, the young daughter of one of the Cloyd brothers, and another may be a guest who fell from a horse and drowned in a stream near the property.

The surface of Chibougamau Lake is usually frozen from early November to mid- May, however, safe ice circulation is generally from mid-November to mid- April.  Geography  Covering an area of , Lake Chibougamau is located about ten kilometers southeast of the town of the same name, east of the summit of the Tower Mountain () and northwest of Lac Saint-Jean. With a length of (in the north-south direction) and in maximum width, this lake is the source of the Chibougamau River. Neighboring slopes The surrounding hydrographic slopes of Lake Chibougamau are: *North side: Waconichi Lake; *East side: Boisvert River; *South side: Obatogamau Lakes and Eau Jaune Lake; *West side: Bourbeau Lake, Chibougamau River, Op√©misca Lake and the Obatogamau River. Islands Of an irregular shape, Lake Chibougamau is dotted with dozens of islands, the main ones are: Marguerite, Tommy, Boulder, Commissaires and Merrill. The secondary islands are: Okay, Refuge, Gordon, Dewar, Scott, Angover, Breakwater, Mermaid, Annie, Lorenzo, Rudolf, Arthur, Line Phony, Bark Letter, Graphite, Granite, Shatter, Labor Day, Lookout, Sioui, Stanislas, Needle, Martine, Francoise, Gabbro, Eugene, Henry, Last, Alphonse, Yvonne, Boulder and Take it Easy. Main bays Around the lake, the main bays are (in order clockwise, from the north): Magnetite, Bag, Islands, Finger, Nepton, Club, Girard, Sunday, Poitevin, Dufresne, Corner, Line, Third Bay, Second Bay, First Bay, Inlet, Dulieux, Queylus, Turnip Cove, Bug-in-a-Rug, Beginnings, Hematite, Machin, Valiquette, Bear, Cedar, Portage. In his writings, explorer Henry O'Sullivan reports the gentle slope of the shores of the lake, interrupted to the north by the mountains of \\"The Wizard\\", Paint and Cummings. In 1895, this explorer indicated that \\"Shabokoma Lake\\" would have \\"a total length of 42 miles, a stretch of water somewhat surprising to have remained unknown until this day. \\" Main tributaries The main tributaries of Lake Chibougamau are: North Coast: *France River (coming from the east) which flows to the bottom of McKenzie Bay from the north shore of the lake; * Lymburner Lake (coming from the east) discharge into Gunn Bay; East Coast : *Robert Lake outlet, located northeast of the lake; *Roberge Lake outlet, located northeast of the lake; *Nepton River which empties into Nepton Bay; *Forest Lake outlet, located northeast of the lake; *Discharge from Jenozeau Lake flowing south to Girard Bay; *Armitage River (from Lake Armitage) flowing north on the east side of the lake; it empties into Girard Bay (located northeast of the lake); South side *Lake Jacques discharge, discharging into Comer Bay; *√ânard River, draining Inlet Lake and discharging into Inlet Bay; Western coast *Wilson Lake Discharge (coming from the west and northwest); this lake flows into Lac Cach√©, located on the west side of Lake Chibougamau; *Blondeau River, coming from the west and pouring into McKenzie Bay; Mouth The mouth of the lake is located on the west side, at the end of Commencement Bay. The water flows through the Rainbow Falls at the mouth of the lake (between the northern end of the Gouin Peninsula and the South-West end of Portage Island). Then, the current runs southwest through the North-East bay of Dor√©s Lake (Chibougamau River) (French: \\"Lac aux Dor√©s\\"), which in turn flows southwesterly through a short passage in the \\"Lac aux Dor√©s\\". The latter lake is in parall√®le (southwest side) to Lake Chibougamau. Lac aux Dor√©s is separated from Chibougamau Lake by the Gouin Peninsula. The mouth of \\"Lac aux Dor√©s\\" is located to the south-west at the bottom of the Malouf bay. The hamlet \\"Obalski\\" is located south of Chibougamau Lake, along the railway.Atlas of Canada, Department of Natural Resources Canada, accessed March 16, 2015.  Toponymy  In 1831, surveyor Joseph Bouchette uses the names \\"Utsissagomo\\" and \\"Vomiting Lake\\" to designate this large body of water. Confirmed as early as 1870, the presence of mineral resources raises interest in the region. In parallel, at XIXth century, recreational and tourism activities, including hunting and fishing, are highlighted. In 1871, surveyor Walter McOuat noted: \\"We did not see anything similar to the chlorite schists of Chibogomou and Wakinitchee [Waconichi] lakes.\\" In 1907, Joseph Obalski, Inspector of Mines of Quebec, uses the current graph \\"Lac Chibougamau\\". The current spelling of the lake is in the Dictionary of Rivers and Lakes of the Province of Quebec (1914 and 1925). In 1914, the Hudson's Bay Company moved its deposit to Obatogamau Lakes. Finally, in 1942, the position will cease operations. In the history, the writing of the lake knew several variants: Shabagamog, Shabugama, Shibogama, Shobokoma, Chibougamou, Chibogamo, Shobogoma, Chibougamoo, Shabogama, Chibiogouma.Source: \\"Names and places of Quebec\\", work of the Commission toponymy of Quebec, published in 1994 and 1996 in the form of a printed illustrated dictionary, and under that of a CD-ROM produced by the company Micro-Intel, in 1997, from this dictionary.

The railway from Saint-F√©licien has contributed to the economic development of the region, particularly the mining and forestry sectors. This railway passes south of the lake and joins the village of Chibougamau located on the west side of the lake.

Gameplay This is a package of two unrelated games: Survival, a science fiction combat game set on an alien planet; and The Barbarian, a fantasy quest game. Either game can be completed in 15 to 45 minutes. The components are an 8.5\\" x 5.5\\" 12-page rulebook with full-color cover; 108 multicolored die-cut counters; two 11\\" x 17\\" maps (one for each game); an information sheet; all of the components packaged in a ziplock bag. Survival In the basic solitaire game of Survival, the player is the pilot of a scout spaceship that has crashed on an alien planet. The player must find his way across a hostile landscape to the nearest survival station, fighting off random monsters on the way. The game also contains a number of scenarios for 2-6 players. Before play begins, each player equips their character with weapons. Combat is simple: the player is allowed one round of ranged fire, and then fights the monster hand-to-hand. Combat is resolved by using a single 6-sided die plus combat bonuses to equal or exceed the target's defense strength. Each successful hit deals one or more wounds; each character can take up to six wounds, with one wound restored through rest every third turn. The Barbarian The Barbarian is a two-player game where one player is Vaam the Barbarian, moving through the countryside seeking his grandfather's sword and shield. The other player controls the random monsters that populate the countryside. Combat is similar to Survival except that two dice are rolled instead of one, and Vaam can receive twenty wounds before dying. The Barbarian can also be played as a solitaire game. Reception In the July 1981 edition of The Space Gamer (Issue No. 41), Aaron Allston had a divided opinion, liking one game but not the other: \\"In short, a beginning gamer will find Survival worthwhile; forget The Barbarian.\\" In the December 1981 edition of Dragon (Issue 56), Tony Watson liked the simplicity of the rules and the speed of the games., but found the plots of both games too clich√©d. Watson also criticized both games as simply a series of dice rolls against random monsters ‚Äî once the character's weapon has been picked, there are no other meangful decisions to be made in terms of strategy or tactics. He concluded, \\"Both games will please those people looking for something easy and quick, but gamers after a real challenge should look elsewhere.\\" References Category:Board games introduced in 1979 Category:Task Force Games games ","title":"Survival / The Barbarian"},{"id":"56028353","text":"Prasophyllum paulinae, commonly known as Pauline's leek orchid, is a species of orchid endemic to the south-west of Western Australia.

As direct entangling operations with photons often require nonlinear effects, probabilistic generation of entangled resource states has been proposed as an alternative path to the direct approach. Creation of the cluster state On a silicon photonic chip, one of the most common platforms for implementing LOQC, there are two typical choices for encoding quantum information, though many more options exist.Rudolph, \\"Why I am optimistic about the silicon-photonic route to quantum computing\\", APL Photonics, 2017. Photons have useful degrees of freedom in the spatial modes of the possible photon paths or in the polarization of the photons themselves. The way in which a cluster state is generated varies with which encoding has been chosen for implementation. Storing information in the spatial modes of the photon paths is often referred to as dual rail encoding. In a simple case, one might consider the situation where a photon has two possible paths, a horizontal path with creation operator a^\\\\dagger and a vertical path with creation operator b^\\\\dagger, where the logical zero and one states are then represented by ::a^\\\\dagger 0_a,0_b\\\\rangle=1_a,0_b\\\\rangle=0\\\\rangle_L and ::b^\\\\dagger 0_a,0_b\\\\rangle=0_a,1_b\\\\rangle=1\\\\rangle_L. Single qubit operations are then performed by beam splitters, which allow manipulation of the relative superposition weights of the modes, and phase shifters, which allow manipulation of the relative phases of the two modes. This type of encoding lends itself to the Nielsen protocol for generating cluster states. In encoding with photon polarization, logical zero and one can be encoded via the horizontal and vertical states of a photon, e.g. ::H\\\\rangle=0\\\\rangle_L and ::V\\\\rangle=1\\\\rangle_L. Given this encoding, single qubit operations can be performed using waveplates. This encoding can be used with the Browne-Rudolph protocol. Nielsen protocol In 2004, Nielsen proposed a protocol to create cluster states, borrowing techniques from the Knill-Laflamme-Milburn protocol (KLM protocol) to probabilistically create controlled-Z connections between qubits which, when performed on a pair of +\\\\rangle=0\\\\rangle+1\\\\rangle states (normalization being ignored), forms the basis for cluster states. While the KLM protocol requires error correction and a fairly large number of modes in order to get very high probability two-qubit gate, Neilsen's protocol only requires a success probability per gate of greater than one half. Given that the success probability for a connection using n ancilla photons is n^2/(n+1)^2, relaxation of the success probability from nearly one to anything over one half presents a major advantage in resources, as well as simply reducing the number of required elements in the photonic circuit. To see how Nielsen brought about this improvement, consider the photons being generated for qubits as vertices on a two dimensional grid, and the controlled-Z operations being probabilistically added edges between nearest neighbors. Using results from percolation theory, it can be shown that as long as the probability of adding edges is above a certain threshold, there will exist a complete grid as a sub-graph with near unit probability. Because of this, Nielsen's protocol doesn't rely on every individual connection being successful, just enough of them that the connections between photons allow a grid. Yoran-Reznik protocol Among the first proposals of utilizing resource states for optical quantum computing was the Yoran-Reznik protocol in 2003. While the proposed resource in this protocol was not exactly a cluster state, it brought many of the same key concepts to the attention of those considering the possibilities of optical quantum computing and still required connecting multiple separate one-dimensional chains of entangled photons via controlled-Z operations. This protocol is somewhat unique in that it utilizes both the spatial mode degree of freedom along with the polarization degree of freedom to help entanglement between qubits. Given a horizontal path, denoted by a, and a vertical path, denoted by b, a 50:50 beam splitter connecting the paths followed by a \\\\pi/2-phase shifter on path a, we can perform the transformations ::H,a\\\\rangle\\\\rightarrow\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2}}(H,b\\\\rangle+V,a\\\\rangle) ::V,a\\\\rangle\\\\rightarrow\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2}}(H,a\\\\rangle-V,b\\\\rangle) ::H,b\\\\rangle\\\\rightarrow\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2}}(H,b\\\\rangle-V,a\\\\rangle) ::V,b\\\\rangle\\\\rightarrow\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2}}(H,a\\\\rangle+V,b\\\\rangle) where \\\\lambda,k\\\\rangle denotes a photon with polarization \\\\lambda on path k. In this way, we have the path of the photon entangled with its polarization. This is sometimes referred to as hyperentanglement, a situation in which the degrees of freedom of a single particle are entangled with each other. This, paired with the Hong-Ou-Mandel effect and projective measurements on the polarization state, can be used to create path entanglement between photons in a linear chain. These one-dimensional chains of entangled photons still need to be connected via controlled-Z operations, similar to the KLM protocol. These controlled-Z connection s between chains are still probabilistic, relying on measurement dependent teleportation with special resource states. However, due to the fact that this method does not include Fock measurements on the photons being used for computation as the KLM protocol does, the probabilistic nature of implementing controlled-Z operations presents much less of a problem. In fact, as long as connections occur with probability greater than one half, the entanglement present between chains will be enough to perform useful quantum computation, on average. Browne-Rudolph protocol An alternative approach to building cluster states that focuses entirely on photon polarization is the Browne-Rudolph protocol. This method rests on performing parity checks on a pair of photons to stitch together already entangled sets of photons, meaning that this protocol requires entangled photon sources. Browne and Rudolph proposed two ways of doing this, called type-I and type-II fusion. =Type-I fusion= In type-I fusion, photons with either vertical or horizontal polarization are injected into modes a and b, connected by a polarizing beam splitter. Each of the photons sent into this system is part of a Bell pair that this method will try to entangle. Upon passing through the polarizing beam splitter, the two photons will go opposite ways if they have the same polarization or the same way if they have the same polarization, e.g. ::H_a,H_b\\\\rangle\\\\rightarrowH_a,H_b\\\\rangle or ::H_a,V_b\\\\rangle\\\\rightarrowH_aV_a,0_b\\\\rangle Then on one of these modes, a projective measurement onto the basis H\\\\rangle\\\\pmV\\\\rangle is performed. If the measurement is successful, i.e. if it detects anything, then the detected photon is destroyed, but the remaining photons from the Bell pairs become entangled. Failure to detect anything results in an effective loss of the involved photons in a way that breaks any chain of entangled photons they were on. This can make attempting to make connections between already developed chains potentially risky. =Type-II fusion= Type-II fusion works similarly to type-I fusion, with the differences being that a diagonal polarizing beam splitter is used and the pair of photons is measured in the two-qubit Bell basis. A successful measurement here involves measuring the pair to be in a Bell state with no relative phase between the superposition of states (e.g. H,H\\\\rangle+V,V\\\\rangle as opposed to H,H\\\\rangle-V,V\\\\rangle). This again entangles any two clusters already formed. A failure here performs local complementation on the local subgraph, making an existing chain shorter rather than cutting it in half. In this way, while it requires the use of more qubits in combining entangled resources, the potential loss for attempts to connect two chains together are not as expensive for type-II fusion as they are for type-I fusion. Computing with cluster states Once a cluster state has been successfully generated, computation can be done with the resource state directly by applying measurements to the qubits on the lattice. This is the model of measurement-based quantum computation (MQC), and it is equivalent to the circuit model. Logical operations in MQC come about from the byproduct operators that occur during quantum teleportation. For example, given a single qubit state \\\\psi\\\\rangle, one can connect this qubit to a plus state (+\\\\rangle=0\\\\rangle+1\\\\rangle) via a two-qubit controlled-Z operation. Then, upon measuring the first qubit (the original \\\\psi\\\\rangle) in the Pauli-X basis, the original state of the first qubit is teleported to the second qubit with a measurement outcome dependent extra rotation, which one can see from the partial inner product of the measurement acting on the two-qubit state: :: (\\\\left\\\\langle +\\\\right Z^m\\\\otimes I)CZ(\\\\left \\\\psi\\\\right\\\\rangle\\\\otimes\\\\left +\\\\right\\\\rangle)=\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2}}HZ^m\\\\left \\\\psi\\\\right\\\\rangle . for m=0,1 denoting the measurement outcome as either the +1 eigenstate of Pauli-X for m=0 or the -1 eigenstate for m=1. A two qubit state \\\\phi\\\\rangle connected by a pair of controlled-Z operations to the state CZ+\\\\rangle^{\\\\otimes 2} yields a two-qubit operation on the teleported \\\\phi\\\\rangle state after measuring the original qubits: ::(\\\\langle+Z^{m_1}\\\\otimes\\\\langle+Z^{m_2}\\\\otimes I)CZ_{1,3}CZ_{2,4}(\\\\phi\\\\rangle\\\\otimes CZ+\\\\rangle^{\\\\otimes 2})=\\\\frac{1}{2}CZ(HZ^{m_1}\\\\otimes HZ^{m_2})\\\\phi\\\\rangle. for measurement outcomes m_1 and m_2. This basic concept extends to arbitrarily many qubits, and thus computation is performed by the byproduct operators of teleportation down a chain. Adjusting the desired single-qubit gates is simply a matter of adjusting the measurement basis on each qubit, and non-Pauli measurements are necessary for universal quantum computation. Experimental Implementations Spatial encoding Four-wave mixing can be thought of as the pair-wise absorption and emission of photons by the electrons in a material. Path- entangled two qubit states have been generated in laboratory settings on silicon photonic chips in recent years, making important steps in the direction of generating optical cluster states. Among methods of doing this, it has been shown experimentally that spontaneous four-wave mixing can be used with the appropriate use of microring resonators and other waveguides for filtering to perform on-chip generation of two-photon Bell states, which are equivalent to two-qubit cluster states up to local unitary operations. To do this, a short laser pulse is injected into an on-chip waveguide that splits into two paths. This forces the pulse into a superposition of the possible directions it could go. The two paths are coupled to microring resonators that allow circulation of the laser pulse until spontaneous four-wave mixing occurs, taking two photons from the laser pulse and converting them into a pair of photons, called the signal s and idler i with different frequencies in a way that conserves energy. In order to prevent the generation of multiple photon pairs at once, the procedure takes advantage of the conservation of energy and ensures that there is only enough energy in the laser pulse to create a single pair of photons. Because of this restriction, spontaneous four-wave mixing can only occur in one of the microring resonators at a time, meaning that the superposition of paths that the laser pulse could take is converted into a superposition of paths the two photons could be on. Mathematically, if \\\\alpha\\\\rangle denotes the laser pulse, the paths are labeled as a and b, the process can be written as ::\\\\alpha\\\\rangle\\\\rightarrow\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2}}(\\\\alpha_a\\\\rangle+\\\\alpha_b\\\\rangle)\\\\rightarrow \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2}}(1_{s,a},0_{s,b},1_{i,a},0_{i,b}\\\\rangle+0_{s,a},1_{s,b},0_{i,a},1_{i,b}\\\\rangle)= \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2}}(00\\\\rangle_L+11\\\\rangle_L) where n_{x,y}\\\\rangle is the representation of having n of photon x on path y. With the state of the two photons being in this kind of superposition, they are entangled, which can be verified by tests of Bell inequalities. Polarization encoding Polarization entangled photon pairs have also been produced on-chip. The setup involves a silicon wire waveguide that is split in half by a polarization rotator. This process, like the entanglement generation described for the dual rail encoding, makes use of the nonlinear process of spontaneous four-wave mixing, which can occur in the silicon wire on either side of the polarization rotator. However, the geometry of these wires are designed such that horizontal polarization is preferred in the conversion of laser pump photons to signal and idler photons. Thus when the photon pair is generated, both photons should have the same polarization, i.e. ::\\\\psi\\\\rangle=H_s,H_i\\\\rangle. The polarization rotator is then designed with the specific dimensions such that horizontal polarization is switched to vertical polarization. Thus any pairs of photons generated before the rotator exit the waveguide with vertical polarization and any pairs generated on the other end of the wire exit the waveguide still having horizontal polarization. Mathematically, the process is, up to overall normalization, ::\\\\alpha\\\\rangle\\\\rightarrow\\\\alpha'\\\\rangle+H_s,H_i\\\\rangle\\\\rightarrow\\\\alpha'\\\\rangle+V_s,V_i\\\\rangle\\\\rightarrowH_s,H_i\\\\rangle+e^{i\\\\phi}V_s,V_i\\\\rangle. Assuming that equal space on each side of the rotator makes spontaneous four- wave mixing equally likely one each side, the output state of the photons is maximally entangled: ::\\\\psi\\\\rangle=\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2}}(H_s,H_i\\\\rangle+e^{i\\\\phi}V_s,V_i\\\\rangle)=\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2}}(00\\\\rangle_L+e^{i\\\\phi}11\\\\rangle_L). States generated this way could potentially be used to build a cluster state using the Browne-Rudolph protocol.

She was one of the first tankers chartered by Union Oil Company for their expanding oil delivery operations in the Pacific. Design and Construction In early 1910s Union Oil Company experienced significant shortage of shipping tonnage due to rapidly expanding South American contracts and looked to add several tankers to its existing fleet of 14. The company was engaged in oil transportation from California to ports in Oregon, Washington, British Columbia, Hawaii, and Central and South America. On August 1, 1912 the Union Oil Company entered into an agreement with a British ship broker to charter for a term of seven years, commencing from the date of delivery, a \\"good British Tank Steamer, to be built....and estimated to have a total deadweight carrying capacity of about 9,700 tons\\". The charterer agreed to pay ¬£2,850 per calendar month commencing on date of delivery of the ship. The ship was laid down in 1913 at Swan, Hunter & Wigham Richardson shipyard at Wallsend, launched on November 12, 1913 (yard number 931), and commissioned in early December of the same year. As built, the ship was long (between perpendiculars) and abeam, a mean draft of . Elsinore was assessed at 6,542 GRT and .

Lee advocated for teachers' rights, women's rights, and affordable housing, and founded the Legislative Black Caucus of Maryland in 1970. She was inducted into the Maryland Women's Hall of Fame in 1989.  Early life and education  She was born Lena King in Sumter County, Alabama, in 1906, one of three children of Samuel Sylvester King and Lula Gully King. Her father was a coal miner and a miners' activist who at times worked as a chauffeur and a butler to make ends meet. Lena attended public schools in Alabama, Illinois, and Pennsylvania, as her father moved around in search of mining jobs. After graduating from Tarentum High School, where she was the only black student and finished 3rd in a class of 70, a teacher arranged for her to receive a scholarship to Cheyney University of Pennsylvania, where she trained as a teacher. In 1927 she moved to Annapolis, Maryland, to take her first teaching job. Four years later she moved to Baltimore, where she taught sixth grade in the Baltimore public schools. Early in her teaching career she joined the American Federation of Teachers and fought for teachers' rights. After earning a B.S. degree from Morgan State University in 1939, Lee was barred from pursuing graduate studies at the University of Maryland due to racial segregation. Maryland instead paid for African Americans to attend school out of state. Lee commuted by train to New York on weekends, and received her M.A. degree from New York University in 1947. Decades later she recalled in an interview, \\"By the time you got to New York, you were worn out, and of course we couldn't ride the Pullmans. This great country actually tolerated that.\\" In 1952 she became the third black woman to receive a law degree from the University of Maryland School of Law. She was admitted to the Maryland Bar in 1953.  Career  While pursuing her degrees, Lee continued to teach in the Baltimore public schools. She served as principal of Henry H. Garnett Elementary School from 1947 to 1964, remaining there even after earning her law degree and being admitted to the bar. As a lawyer she worked mostly on domestic cases. In the 1950s Mayor Thomas D'Alesandro Jr. appointed her to the Baltimore Housing and Urban Renewal Commission, where she fought for affordable housing for the city's black community. Later she served on the Maryland Advisory Council for Higher Education as an appointee of Governor J. Millard Tawes. In 1966 she was drafted to run for state delegate. She ran on a progressive platform and was elected that November. Lee represented Baltimore's 4th legislative district (now the 44th) from 1967 to 1982. During her 16 years in the Maryland House of Delegates, she became known for attacking what she considered \\"bad bills.\\" She saved the historic Orchard Street Church from demolition, helped get Morgan State University accredited, and advocated for the rights of teachers, women, and children. She founded the Maryland Legislative Black Caucus in 1970. In a 1996 interview in the Crisis she recalled, \\"There was a need to huddle together. There's still a need and we don't realize it. We think we've made it. I often wonder where we're going.\\" In 1971 she famously proposed a \\"Marriage-Contractual Renewal Bill,\\" which would have allowed Maryland residents to annul or renew their marriages every three years. The bill received national attention, and Lee made appearances on the Merv Griffin Show and the Today Show. Although the bill did not pass, Lee's efforts contributed to Maryland's eventual adoption of no-fault divorce.  Personal life  In 1937 she married Robert Lee, a Baltimore businessman. Her husband died circa 1965. After leaving public office, Lee was active in many civic and cultural organizations, including the Monumental City Bar Association, the Maryland League of Women's Clubs, the DuBois Circle, the Sharp Street Memorial United Methodist Church, the Herbert M. Frisby Historical Society, and the Madison Park Improvement Association. She died on August 24, 2006, at her home in Baltimore.  Awards and honors  Lee received a Presidential Citation from the National Association for Equal Opportunity in Higher Education in 1988. She was inducted into the Maryland Women's Hall of Fame in 1989. In 1995 she received the Distinguished Jurist Award from the National Bar Association and was inducted into the National Bar Association Hall of Fame. She is featured in 2000 Women of Achievement, Bicentennial Issue of Who's Who in America, Who's Who of Women, Black Americans, International Biography, and Women of Achievement in Maryland History. In December 2005, the House of Representatives voted to name the post office at 1826 Pennsylvania Avenue in Baltimore, MD, in Lee's honor. The legislation was sponsored by Representative Elijah Cummings, who credited Lee with getting him started in politics. Lee attended the dedication ceremony in June 2006. Her papers are stored in the Thurgood Marshall Law Library at the University of Maryland School of Law.  References   External links  * Lena K. Lee 1966 campaign poster * Photos of Lena K.

Early life Penman was born in 1858 in Hammondsville, Ohio, to Scottish parents John Penman and Margaret Frazer. At the age of ten, he left school to work as a cooper. In 1878, Penman went to work in the storage tank works of his brother-in-law, William Graver, in Pittsburgh. The Graver Tank Company was then expanding due to heavy demand from the Standard Oil Company. Penman soon became supervisor of the Pittsburgh works, a position he later also held at the company's subsequent locations in Lima, Ohio and Chicago, Illinois. On December 13, 1883, Penman married Alice McCoy, of Enon Valley, Pennsylvania. They had two children. East Chicago In 1888, William Graver sent Penman to East Chicago to supervise the construction of the new Graver Tank Works there. Penman arrived in June 1888. At the time, the development of East Chicago had only just begun, with the completion of a railroad line to the city by the Chicago & Calumet Terminal Railway earlier the same year. The Graver Tank Works was the first set of buildings in the city. Upon moving to East Chicago with his family, Penman built a two-story home at the corner of Tod and 148th Street, in what is today the city's Southside neighborhood. The Penmans boarded in nearby Hammond until the house was complete. The two-story house, which was soon joined by others, stood across the street from the Graver Tank Works. The Gravers' was the first home built in East Chicago. The following year, in 1889, East Chicago was incorporated as a town. Penman was elected treasurer of the town council. East Chicago held a special election of municipal officers on March 14, 1893, in order to become a city. Penman was elected mayor. He was reelected in April 1894. In the 1894 election, Penman (a Republican) was opposed by the Democratic candidate, Colonel Redmond D. Walsh. In August 1895, Walsh swore out a warrant against Penman, accusing him of improperly using his office to secure a public contract for water mains. Penman thus became the first of many East Chicago mayors to face public corruption charges. However, when the case was tried to a jury, the jury not only acquitted Penman, but jointly issued a public testimonial to his character. In October 1895, Penman sued Walsh for defamation. As mayor, Penman sought to establish the necessary infrastructure for urban development, including a municipal water supply and fire department. However, these utilities ultimately went bankrupt due to the city's inadequate finances in this early stage. For a time in the 1890s, Penman and George McCoy operated the Penman & McCoy Tank and Boiler-Making Works in East Chicago. However, the works entered receivership and were sold in 1898. Texas In 1901, Penman formed his own company, the Penman Tank Company. Initially based in East Chicago, the company moved to Beaumont, Texas in 1902. Before the factory was even built in Beaumont, Penman Tank already had $500,000 in contracts, including from the Southern Pacific Railroad. Penman died in on November 30, 1917, and was buried in Beaumont.

At 3:20 am, Leveson sent a text message to a friend saying, \\"Mike's having a f. king cry, he is taking me home and won't let me stay! F. king c. t!\\" A minute later, he sent another message: \\"He needs to f. king get over himself\\". Later that day, at 12:20 pm, CCTV cameras captured Atkins buying a mattock and duct tape at Bunnings Warehouse in Taren Point. On 25 September, Leveson's parents, Mark and Faye, reported their son missing after he failed to show up to work. On 27 September, Leveson's car, a green 1999 Toyota Corolla hatchback, was found abandoned outside of a public toilet at Waratah Park Reserve in Sutherland, a known \\"gay beat\\". A Bunnings receipt with Atkins's fingerprints on it was found in the boot. A speaker system had also been removed from the boot; it was later found in the garage area of the unit Atkins shared with Leveson. Police did not believe Leveson parked his car there, based on evidence found, and suspected foul play. Investigation Arrest and trial On 5 August 2008, Atkins was arrested at his apartment in Cronulla and charged with murder. On 3 September 2009, Atkins's trial began in the Supreme Court of New South Wales. On 20 October, the jury found Atkins not guilty of murder and an alternative charge of manslaughter. Search for and discovery of remains On most weekends since 2008, Mark and Faye searched the Royal National Park with picks and shovels in search of their son's remains. Their starting point was where Leveson's car was found. They searched at around 2 am looking for suitable places and would return in the daytime to \\"search properly\\". In November 2016, Gabrielle Upton, the Attorney General of New South Wales, agreed to an immunity deal with Atkins, which protected him from \\"being charged with perjury if he showed police where the body was\\". The specific terms of the deal were \\"no body, no deal\\". On 10 November, police began a large-scale search of the Royal National Park using information provided by Atkins, but no remains were found and the search was called off on 17 November. Another search was undertaken in January 2017, but no remains were found. On 25 May 2017, police resumed the search and on 31 May, skeletal remains were uncovered beneath a cabbage-tree palm. DNA testing confirmed that they belonged to Leveson. The Levesons took the tree and planted it in their backyard. Inquest On 5 December 2017, the deputy state coroner, Elaine Truscott, delivered an open finding at the inquest of Leveson's death. There was insufficient evidence to \\"positively determine ‚Äî to the requisite standard ‚Äî how or why Matt died\\". Leveson's father Mark said, \\"There's some relief, there's some frustration, there's some anger, so there's lots of emotions going through us but relief's one of the ones right now\\".

Early life and education Patricia Burnett was born in 1920 in Brooklyn, New York. Her parents separated when she was young, and she and her mother moved to Toledo, Ohio. Later, her mother married a physician who worked at Henry Ford Hospital, and the family moved to Detroit, Michigan. Burnett was named Miss Michigan in 1942. She went on to become a runner up to Miss America the same year. In the latter pageant, she was named \\"Miss Congeniality.\\" Burnett started painting portraits at a very young age. At the age of twelve, she earned a scholarship to study at the Toledo Museum of Art for four years. She also began selling portraits for 25 dollars at the age of fourteen. At age 16, Burnett began enrolled at Goucher College in Baltimore, Maryland, where she obtained a fine arts degree. For her graduate education, she studied at the Instituto Allende in Mexico and Wayne State University in Detroit. Burnett also personally studied under Sarkis Sarkisian, Walter Midener, and John Carroll. Burnett voiced the girlfriends of The Green Hornet and the Lone Ranger on their respective radio series. Activism In 1962, Burnett became the first woman to occupy a studio in the Scarab Club, a collective of artists in Detroit. She reported multiple incidents of gender discrimination that she experienced in the club. For example, while she was in the restroom, other members of the club would jiggle the door handle in an attempt to \\"set her on edge.\\" After a few months, however, they stopped and gave her a gold key for the restroom. Burnett kept a personal studio at the Scarab Club until 1987. She also went on to serve on the Scarab Club's board of directors for two terms. Burnett advocated for opening up several other local organizations, including the Detroit Athletic Club, to women. Prior to her efforts, women had to enter the club through the back door. After Burnett organized protests, however, the club changed its rules regarding women. Burnett became increasingly interested in activism after reading The Feminine Mystique by Betty Friedan. She decided to reach out to Friedan to report an incident where a male portrait client asked Burnett to sign her initials instead of her full name, as he did not want anyone to know a woman painted the portrait. Burnett refused to comply with this request and signed her full name. Friedan was impressed by Burnett's actions and resolve, and in 1969 Friedan tasked Burnett with creating and heading the Michigan chapter of the National Organization for Women (NOW). Burnett officially launched the Michigan chapter of NOW on March 30, 1969. She served as its president until 1972. Burnett went on to serve as the chair of NOW's international board between 1971-1975. She organized NOW's first international conference in the fall of 1972; NOW representatives from twenty-two countries attended. Burnett organized this conference along with Jo Ann Evans Gardner, Rona Fields, and Wilma Scott Heide. The conference was held at Harvard Divinity School and Lesley College, in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Due to her involvement with women's rights movements, Burnett was put on a watch list by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Michigan State Police. In 1972, Burnett was named to the Michigan Women's Commission by then-governor William Milliken. She went on to serve four terms on the commission, including two terms as the commission's chair. In addition, she chaired the Association of Commissions for Women, co- founded Michigan's International Women's Forum, served on the board of the Detroit International Institute, co-convened the Michigan Republican Women's Task Force, and served as the vice-president of the French-American Chamber of Commerce in Detroit. She also lectured for the United States State Department's Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs. Burnett was also a life member of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) and a co-founder of Women in the House and Senate (WISH).  Arts career  As an artist, Burnett is best known as a society painter. Over the course of her career, she painted portraits of many influential people, including Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Margaret Thatcher, Betty Ford, Corazon Acquino, Joyce Carol Oates, Barbara Walters, Rosa Parks, and Indira Gandhi. She was also the first woman commissioned to paint portraits of a Detroit mayor and a Michigan governor. When asked how she got to paint those famous individuals, she reportedly remarked \\"Oh honey, I just called them.\\" She remarked that it took her three months usually to complete a painting to a point that she was ready to show it to her subject. She even would take down old paintings of hers that hung from her friend's walls, and update them. In addition to portraits, she also painted floral still-life paintings and created sculptures. Over the years, Burnett taught multiple portrait painting seminars. Throughout the course of her life, Burnett's exhibited her work in over four hundred juried shows. She also had 40 solo shows. She created well- over one thousand works. Burnett's art appears in museums in many countries.  Personal life  She married a surgeon, William Anding Lange, in 1945. They had one child together. She later divorced her Lange and subsequently married Harry Burnett, who was a businessman. They had three children together. Burnett's four children are William Lange, Dr. Barry Burnett, Terrill Hill Burnett, and Hillary Hill Burnett. After Harry Burnett's death in 1979, she married Robert Siler, who she met in an airport. Siler died in 2013. Burnett co-wrote her autobiography True Colors: An Artist's Journey from Beauty Queen to Feminist with Jack Lessenberry. It was released in 1995. Burnett died at the age of 94 in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan on 29 December 2014. She continued painting until six months before her death.

The album consists of songs he wrote in his 20s and 30s. The feeling is \\"wintery\\", as the songs were based on cold times such as during a snowy winter in Moscow. Its words derive from the prologue of 'Small Pieces, When Love is Gone'. Lee Young-Hoon composed seven albums in collaboration with singer Lee Moon-se, then moved to Russia and released his Small Pieces album with the Bolshoi orchestra. The first album, featuring \\"Sorrow String Melody\\" was released in 1993. He released his second album with the Bolshoi orchestra one year after the first. This album consisted of orchestral arrangements of his previous hit songs. He submitted the work to the largest music exhibition in the world, MIDEM in Cannes.

Highlights  It is a landmark building and represents Kurazukuri Zone lined with old storehouses constructed in a style called Kurazukuri. It is a three-story tower measuring 16 meters in height with a bell kept inside. The bell is about 700 kg in weight, measuring about 130cm in length and 82 cm in diameter. The present structure is the 4th generation and goes back to 1894, a year after the Great Fire of Kawagoe. In old times, the bell was rung manually at specific times, though today it is rung mechanically four times a day. (6am,12pm,3pm,6pm) It was designated as a tangible cultural asset by Kawagoe City in 1958, and it was also selected as one of ‚Äú100 soundscapes of Japan : Preserving Our Heritage‚Äù by the Ministry of the Environment in 1996. The tower is adjacent to Yakushi Shrine which is believed to give efficacy to those suffering from illness, especially from eye diseases.  History  The precise date of its construction is not known, but it is said that it was built between 1627 and 1634 (during the Kan'ei era in the Edo period) on the orders of Sakai Tadakatsu, the lord of Kawagoe Domain. In 1639, Matsudaira Nobutsuna who took office as the lord of Kawagoe Domain found the original bell wrecked and not in use, and ordered to cast a new bell in 1653. According to a topography named \\"Kawagoe Somen\\", further in 1704, the lord of Yamura (located in the present Tsuru City, Yamanashi Prefecture) named Akimoto Takatomo became the lord of Kawagoe Domain, who brought a bell which had been used in the castle town of Yamura to Kawagoe. This bell originally cast in 1694 by a local caster had a beautiful sound, and it‚Äôs said to have sounded differently before misfortune such as flood or earthquake took place. In 1733, fire tower was put on the top of the bell tower with the increase in the number of houses to play a role as a fire bell. In 1767, when Matsudaira Tomonori became the lord of Kawagoe Domain, the bell kept in the tower was the one made in 1653, not the one with a beautiful sound. Because that bell was in a damaged condition, a bell at a nearby temple came to be used. It was in 1849 when a new bell was cast after 73 years of absence of its original bell. Unfortunately, the new bell, long wanted by locals, did not sound well with a low sound, and again, a bell at a nearby temple came to be used. In 1856, both the tower and the bell were burned by fire, and a new bell was cast in 1861. But again, the new bell was burned in 1893 by the Great Fire of Kawagoe, which burned 1,302 houses, nearly one-third of all the houses in the town. The present tower was constructed in 1894, a year after the Great Fire of Kawagoe. In order to reconstruct the clock tower as the symbol of Kawagoe, leading local merchants collected contributions from successful business people from Kawagoe. The reconstructed tower once stopped telling time during and after the war, and it was in 1975 when it resumed telling time by machine.

In order to separate it from Hikawa Shrine in Omiya Ward, Saitama City, it is often called Kawagoe Hikawa Shrine. Hikawa Shrine is known for its Reitaisai, or a festival considered the origin of Kawagoe festival, which was registered as a National Important Intangible Folk Cultural Property and listed as a UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage. It's also well known for its \\"corridor of windchiimes\\".  History  Hikawa Shrine was founded during the reign of Emperor Kinmei, in 541. The shrine had an influential parishioner's group with various subordinate priests. Since 1457, when Kawagoe Castle was built by Ota Doshin, Ota Dokan (father and son), the shrine had been worshipped by the successive lords of Kawagoe Domain as the genius of the castle town Kawagoe. The main building of the shrine has elaborate carvings, which was donated by Matsudaira Naritsune, the lord of Kawagoe Domain in 1849. It was designated as an important cultural asset of Saitama. The torii gate measuring 15 meters high is one of the tallest wooden torii gates in Japan, and has a framed symbol with writings from Katsu Kaishu. The shrine enshrines the god of married couples, so it has been worshipped as the ‚ÄòGod of Marriage‚Äô.  Shinto belief  This Shrine is dedicated to the spirits of 5 gods, Susanoo-no- Mikoto, his wife Kushinadahime, and Onamuchino-mikoto, their son. Kushinadahime's parents Ashinaduchi no mikoto and Tenaduchi no mikoto are also enshrined there. Since these gods are family, including two couples, people worship at Hikawa shrine for good fortune in marriage and family.  Events  Pray for good match: held at 8:08 on the 8th and on the 4th Saturday of each month. (8 is considered a lucky number after its shape in Chinese character) Reitaisai: held on October 14th, the biggest festival of the shrine. Float event held immediately after Reitaisai is the famous Kawagoe Festival, which is designated as a National Important Intangible Folk Cultural Property and listed as the UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage. Kawagoe Festival: held on the 3rd weekend of October, in which elaborately decorated floats parade throughout the castle town Kawagoe. Great Purification: held on July 31st and December 31st to purify ourselves of daily uncleanness.

Actuation for the controller is provided via modulation of capable active or reactive power devices throughout the grid. Such actuators are most commonly previously-existing power system devices, such as high- voltage DC (HVDC) transmission lines and static VAR compensators (SVCs) which serve primary purposes not directly related to the WADC application. However, damping may be achieved with the utilization of other devices installed with the express purpose of stability augmentation, including energy storage technologies. Wide-area instability of a large electrical grid unequipped with a WADC is the result of the loss of generator rotor synchronicity and is typically envisioned as a generator (or group of generators) oscillating with an undamped exponential trajectory as the result of insufficient damping torque.  Rotor Instability Phenomena  Large interconnected power systems are susceptible to generator rotor instability, particularly when disparate machine groups are connected to the system through high impedance transmission lines. Previously unaccounted for load growth, transmission lines operating closer to rated capacity, connecting two previously electrically isolated subsystems by a single transmission line, and increased renewable resource penetration increase the possibility of lightly-damped oscillations. While several causes of resonance exist in electrical grids, inter-area oscillations pose the greatest threat to wide-spread breakup leading to substantial power outages. Two main sources of inter-area modes are identified: 1.) two previously electrically isolated systems which are connected by a single (or several parallel) transmission lines or 2.) increased load and generation in an existing system without increased transmission capability. Both of these conditions continue to be imposed on most large interconnected systems transitioning to the smart grid architecture. Rotor instability phenomena may be studied by considering two different disturbance types: small-signal and transient. Small-signal stability considers an electric grid subject to \\"normal\\" operating conditions, while transient stability studies the ability of the system to retain stability in the event of a large disturbance (e.g. transmission line fault). While many different features of the electrical grid impact rotor stability (e.g. transmission line congestion, power system stabilizer (PSS) settings, etc.), the WADC architecture introduces sufficient torque to quell the negative effects of resonant systems.  Small-Signal Stability  Small-signal rotor stability is the ability of a system to retain synchronicity under ambient perturbation. The system is linearizable under such an assumption, facilitating the application of linear system theory for stability assessment and WADC design. The power transferred between two machines serially connected by impedance X with sending voltage V_s and receiving voltage V_r is given by P={V_{s}V_{r} \\\\over X}\\\\sin\\\\delta, where \\\\delta is the difference in internal rotor angle of the two machines. Note that to deliver additional power to a load with constant impedance with fixed sending and receiving end voltage, angular separation must increase. Maximum power is transferred between the machines when \\\\delta=90^{o}; the two generators lose synchronicity for any angle greater than this value. Nominal operating conditions assume \\\\delta<40^0 to ensure a sufficient margin of stability. An ever increasing load with fixed power system equipment (e.g. transmission line impedances constant) force electrical grid to operate closer to unacceptable rotor angle ranges. This has the effect of diminishing safety margins for the continuous operation of the system, warranting the implementation of a WADC.  Transient Stability  The so-called swing equation provides the differential relationship between accelerating power (i.e. the difference between mechanical power at the shaft and electrical power delivered) and the rotor angle. Considering a turbine spinning at sufficiently high speed that perturbations in rotational velocity may be temporarily ignored, the swing equation (assuming no rotational friction loss) may be expressed thusly: \\\\frac{2H}{\\\\omega_0}\\\\frac{d^2 \\\\delta}{dt^2}=P_m- P_e=P_a, where H is the inertia constant, \\\\omega_0 the nominal system frequency in rad/sec (roughly 377 for a 60 Hz system), P_e the electrical power, and P_m the mechanical power introduced by the prime mover. The swing equation establishes a second-order differential relationship that may be solved analytically or using the equal-area criterion (EAC) for a single- machine infinite bus (SMIB) system. Transient stability considers contingent events of substantial impact on the system that linearization fails to accurately represent the dynamics of interest, including generator trips and transmission line faults. The result of transient analysis provides an indication of whether or not the generators, when perturbed substantially (i.e. allowed to accelerate/decelerate due to power imbalance), will eventually decelerate/accelerate back to an equilibrium point within reason. When dealing with large multi-machine systems, analytical solution is intractable and stability assessment must be transitioned to a nonlinear numerical integration platform.  Methods of Actuation  To enhance the rotor stability of a modern electrical grid, various methods to provide damping have been considered for WADCs. High-voltage DC transmission lines, power system stabilizers, wind turbines.., and flexible AC transmission equipment are capable of attenuating the effects of resonant inter-area oscillatory behavior. Methods employing PSSs frequently modify the generator's local PSS control loop, adding an additional voltage reference term to the automatic voltage regulator (AVR) circuit. Since nominal PSS control design servos based on perturbations in rotational velocity, sensors in addition to a standard rotary encoder are required. Modulation of active power between several coherent generator sets is a common approach to damping inter-area oscillations. The highest capacity and currently viable actuators are high- voltage DC (HVDC) transmission lines. By modulating the active power shared between converter stations, substantial positive impact may be realized by employing such equipment. HVDC is limited by their quantity of operational lines and difficulty to install new units. Grid-scale batteries have been considered for active power modulation, in addition to HVDC. While providing active power (and hence damping torque) in a similar fashion to HVDC, energy storage devices are limited by capacity and expense. Energy storage units are more geographically flexible and easily installed than HVDC, however. Static VAR compensators (SVCs) and other reactive devices are also used as actuators in wide-area damping control  Sensory Equipment  Due to the geographically disparate nature of actuators, sensor suites must maintain time synchronism. While local Caesium atomic clocks offer the highest accuracy time fidelity, GPS technology allows continued synchronicity of measured control feedback signals as they are sent to the aggregated WADC processing center. Without remote sensing capability, the WADC control scheme is severely limited in damping capability. Phasor measurement units (PMUs) are typically preferred to obtain sufficient fidelity in voltage/current angle measurements. These modern sensors provide sufficiently high reporting rate and minimal measurement error required for high-performance control systems. However, latency and the potential for GPS spoofing provide challenges for the implementation of a WADC with PMUs  See also  * Smart grid * Voltage regulator * Wind turbine * High-voltage direct current * Utility frequency * Power system automation * Electric power transmission References Category:Electric power distribution ","title":"Wide-area damping control"},{"id":"56028872","text":"Fazilka was a Lok Sabha parliamentary constituency in Punjab, India until 1967.

Dhaka is appearing in their fourth final and have won the championship in all their previous finals. Rangpur is appearing in their first ever final match. Both teams were on even terms as they have won the matches against each other this season. Report Dhaka won the toss and decided to bowl first. The decision was proving to be successful when they got rid of Johnson Charles early thanks to skipper Shakib Al Hasan. But after the 10th over, the partnership of Brendon McCullum and Chris Gayle proved to be devastating. Their partnership mainly consisted of boundaries and particularly Gayle, who hit a record 18 sixes. His score of 146 off 69 balls is the tournament highest. McCullum gave him a helping hand by scoring a decent 51 off 43. The Rangpur innings thus ended as 206 for 1. The second innings started with Dhaka quickly losing wickets. At a time they 87 for 7 due to the excellent bowling by Rangpur bowlers. Jahurul Islam provided some resistance with his 50 off 38 balls. But soon wickets tumbled down and Dhaka innings came to an end with 149/9, handing Rangpur 57 runs victory and also the championship. Summary Chris Gayle was awarded as the man of the match for his aforementioned innings and also won the man of the series award. The highest run scorer award was also awarded to him and the most wicket taker award was given to Shakib Al Hasan.

Of the 45 recorded Coastal Coles Creek sites in the Petite Anse region, it is the only one with ceremonial substructure mounds. These indicate that it was possibly the center of a local chiefdom. Description The site is located on the only significant high ground in the marshy area, Pecan Island, a bifurcated backridge of alluvial deposits known as a \\"chenier\\". The geologic feature formed about 4000 to 6000 years ago when the shifting of the Mississippi delta stranded ancient beaches. The area was a rich environment with abundant marine resources from brackish and freshwater marshes and woodland resources from the forests on the cheniers (named by the early French settlers for the oak trees or \\"ch√™nes\\" that grew on them). Much of the indigenous local population did not live permanently at the Morgan site in prehistoric times, but in scattered hamlets and homesteads, often identified by the shell middens left behind at the edges of lakes and streams. The site originally included four ceremonial platform mounds arranged around the four sides of a central rectangular plaza. The mounds themselves were built in stages over an extended period, with gaps in between construction phases. These stages included a pre-mound midden, indicating people were living at the site before the construction of mounds. Later residents raised a mound over this area, and built a separate structure at its summit. This earthwork construction was a sophisticated engineering feat, using the loose and gritty sand and crushed shell material of the chenier, mixed with the scooped-up topsoil of the midden, to construct a stable rectangular embankment. This embankment was then filled in with more of the loose chenier material of sand and crushed shell. The use of the embankment created structures stable enough to last more than 1000 years without collapsing. The mound was overlain with a protective cap of silty, gray clay taken from a local bayou. At a later date, a second building episode enlarged and raised the mound higher, with the eventual height of Mound 1 reaching more than . Another structure was built on the new summit. The structure at the summit was a in diameter circular building, with many interior partitions and a large central hearth. The building was constructed of wooden posts set into the mound summit surface and covered with a layer of daub or clay, creating a relatively permanent structure. Multiple post holes at the site suggest the structures may have been rebuilt more than once. Inhabitants A map showing the extent of the Coles Creek cultural period and some important sites The inhabitants of the Morgan Mounds seem to have been an anomaly in the area. Before the building of Morgan, starting in about 700 CE, the local population were thinly scattered hunter-gatherers, who did not build large settlements or ceremonial mounds like their northern neighbors of the Troyville culture (400 to 700 CE) of the same time period. Ceramic analysis indicates that while they were a part of Coles Creek tradition during the Coastal Coles Creek period, these people traded with and were more influenced by the peoples of the Weeden Island cultures of the Gulf Coast and Florida panhandle than they were by the Coles Creek of northern Louisiana and Mississippi. Excavations at the site have found ceramic workshops and examples of elite pottery and other goods. Examination of midden deposits on the mound summits and flanks and elsewhere at the site indicates that those who lived on top of the mounds enjoyed more and better food resources than the people who did not live atop the mounds, further indicating their elite status. Based on his excavations at the site in 1986, Dr. Ian Brown has speculated that the sudden appearance of substructure mound building, new pottery styles, and a burgeoning elite class may have signaled a population intrusion or, at the very least, an inspiration from outside the area, although this has not yet been confirmed. Excavations The first archaeological investigations of the site were in 1926, undertaken by Henry B. Collins, Jr., assistant entomologist for the Smithsonian Institution. He found several different varieties of pottery at the site, as well as human burials, some of which showed signs of artificial cranial deformation with pronounced fronto-occipital flattening of the skull. The southernmost mound, Mound 4, was leveled in the mid-1950s during the construction of LA 82. The site was next surveyed in 1979 by Dr. Ian Brown and Richard S. Fuller, Jr. for the Lower Mississippi Survey undertaken by the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology. After plans for leveling of some of the mounds by the landowner in 1985, and the subsequent discovery of the \\"Morgan effigy\\" in Mound 2 fill dirt, emergency salvage archaeology was undertaken at the site in 1986 by Brown, Richard Fuller, and Diane Fuller. Morgan effigy A carved deer antler figure known as the \\"Morgan effigy\\" was found in fill dirt taken by the landowner in 1985 from one of the mounds. The artistic stylization of the small sculpture shows it to have been a human death figure. The presence of bones in the same fill dirt means it may have been interred with a prominent member of the community. It is the only known Coles Creek culture artwork to be found that is not made from ceramic. The effigy is part of a permanent display at the Alliance Center in nearby downtown Abbeville, Louisiana. A drawing of it is used as the logo for the Vermilion Historical Society. Nearby sites Other smaller non- mound sites in the area have also produced material from the Coastal Coles Creek period. Investigations in 1946 by Robert Wauchope at the Little Pecan Island Site (16 CM 43), near Grand Chenier, Louisiana in Cameron Parish, produced ceramic chronologies dating to between 800-1100 CE. A number of flexed burials were also found at the site.

He played college football at Iowa State University. He was selected as a first team All-American and first team All-Big 12 in 2017. Early years Lanning was a multi-sport star at Ankeny High School earning all-state selections in football, baseball, and wrestling. In 2012 he won state championships in both baseball and football his senior seasons. As the three- year starting quarterback at Ankeny, Lanning had 7,642 all-purpose career yards. Recruiting After high school Lanning was very lightly recruited for football. His only two offers were Nebraska and Iowa State, he ultimately picked the Cyclones. College career 2015 season Lanning redshirted his initial college season and only played in one game on special teams his freshman season. In 2015, he played in 11 games and started quarterback for the final five. He finished the season with 1,247 passing yards and 10 passing touchdowns in addition to 330 rushing yards and four rushing touchdowns. His season highs included 162 passing yards on 11 of 22 attempts and 130 yards rushing and two rushing touchdowns against Oklahoma State as well as throwing for three touchdowns and 210 yards against Kansas State. 2016 season His junior season, Lanning was a threat through the air as well as on the ground. In addition to throwing for 1,290 yards and nine touchdowns he ran for 518 yard and led the team with 11 rushing touchdowns, this was the 10th most by FBS quarterbacks. He was responsible for 20 of the Cyclone's 39 offensive touchdowns and ended the season with a streak of 121 consecutive passes without an interception. Against Baylor he threw for 261 yards and two scores on 17 of 23 passes as well as running for 57 yards and an additional touchdown. Lanning had a career day against Texas Tech tying the school record for five rushing touchdowns in a game in addition to breaking the school record for rushing yards by a quarterback with 171 yards on 17 carries. 2017 season At the end of the 2016 season Jacob Park took over as the full-time starting quarterback. In an unheralded move during the off-season, head coach Matt Campbell asked Lanning to switch positions from quarterback to middle linebacker. He was able to work up the depth chart and was the starting middle linebacker for the Cyclones opening game against UNI. Despite starting on defense, Lanning continued to play special teams as well as wildcat quarterback in short yardage and goal line situations. He finished the season leading the team in tackles, second in tackles for a loss, rushing yards, and rushing touchdowns. Season highlights included eight tackles, 1.5 sacks, and an interception against Akron as well as 20 tackles against Texas. Lanning was named the Walter Camp Defensive Player of the Week after a standout performance against #3 Oklahoma that included eight tackles, a sack, a fumble recovery, nine rushing attempts for 35 yards and two passes for 25 yards. In the match-up against Oklahoma State, Lanning had five tackles, half a sack, in addition to throwing a touchdown to Allen Lazard. At the conclusion of the season he was selected as a first team All-American and named to the first team All-Big 12.

He was suffect consul in the for a few days in the month of March AD 46 as the colleague of Marcus Junius Silanus; Quintus Sulpicius Camerinus is recorded as consul for the rest of the nundinium.Giuseppe Camedoca, \\"I consoli del 43 e gli Antistii Veteres d'et√† claudia dalla riedizione delle TabulaeHerculanenses\\", Zeitschrift f√ºr Papyrologie und Epigraphik, 140 (2002), p. 235 Camerinus is also known to have been urban praetor in the year 43. He is known entirely from inscriptions. Because Camerinus reached the consulate within three years of becoming praetor, one can deduce he was one of the patricians, who enjoyed the privilege of becoming consul so quickly.Anthony Birley, The Fasti of Roman Britain (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1981), pp. 15f Further, one can deduce that Camerinus also was born 30 years before he became praetor, in the year 13, as that was the usual age patricians held that traditional Roman magistracy.Birley, Fasti, p. 15 It is also not uncontroversial that Camerinus was the son of Gaius Antistius Vetus, consul in 23. From his name Giuseppe Camodeca deduced that Camerinus' mother was the daughter of Quintus Sulpicius Camerinus, consul in AD 9, identifying her as Sulpicia. Camodeca also identified two men as his brothers: Gaius Antistius Vetus, ordinary consul in 50; and Lucius Antistius Vetus, ordinary consul in 55.Camedoca, \\"I consoli del 43\\", pp. 234-236  Enigmas  Camerinus presents a number of problems in the little we know about him. First there is his praenomen Camerinus which is not one of the 20-odd traditional examples known; in fact, its only attested use as a praenomen only for this person. However, a number of Camerinus' contemporaries present unusual praenomina: Paullus Fabius Persicus (consul 34); the two men named Faustus Cornelius Sulla Lucullus (suffect consul 31), and his son Faustus Cornelius Sulla Felix, consul in 52. But more problematic is the brevity of his tenure. Documents exist attesting him as consul for 15 and 23 March 46. However, the Fasti Teanenses, which reveals many details about the consuls of this period, omit all mention of Camerinus; it credits Sulpicius Camerinus with holding the office from the beginning of March through the end of June. A number of explanations have been proposed to explain Camerinus Antistius omission, but Nikolaus Pachowiak points out they are all unsatisfactory.Pachowiak, \\"Gaius/Appius Iunius Silanus und Camerinus Antistius Vetus\\", Zeitschrift f√ºr Papyrologie und Epigraphik, 190 (2014), pp. 247-250 Pachowiak proposes that the two are the same man; he proposes that the consul's full name was Quintus Sulpicius Camerinus Antistius Vetus. Pachowiak remarks that it should not be a surprise that the literary tradition only knows him by his first three names, pointing to Galba and noting that Suetonius is the only literary source from which we learn the emperor had adopted the names Lucius Livius Ocella.Pachowiak, \\"Camerinus Antistius Vetus\\", p. 250 While it would be the simplest solution -- this provides a pre-consular career for Sulpicius Camerinus, and a post-consular career for Antistius Vetus -- and there is no evidence against it, more evidence is needed before Pachowiak's identification is accepted as fact.

Stefan or Stjepan Ilija Verkoviƒá was a 19th-century Bosnian ethnographer and folklorist. Born to Bosnian Croat parents, he identified as South Slav and initially he supported the Serbian and later the Bulgarian national cause.Balazs Trencsenyi, Michal Kopecek eds., National Romanticism: The Formation of National Movements: Discourses of Collective Identity in Central and Southeast Europe 1770‚Äì1945, Volume 2 , Central European University Press, 2006, ,p. 182. Biography Verkoviƒá was born in Ugljari, Ottoman Empire on March 5, 1821. He passed his education in the Franciscan school of Tolisa (1830‚Äì1833), and then studied philosophy and theology in Zagreb University, where he was influenced by the ideas of the Illyrian movement. In 1843, he contacted the Serbian government and in the following years he served secret missions in parts of today Croatia, Montenegro, Kosovo and Serbia, then under Austrian or Ottoman rule. During his tours through the Balkan lands he searched for medieval Slavonic manuscripts, antique coins and various antiques, recorded folk songs and customs. In 1848 he met in Belgrade Ilija Gara≈°anin and adopted his pan- Serbian ideas. Subsequently, he refused a job in the Serbian state administration, and in 1850 he moved to Serres in the Ottoman Empire, where he spent nearly 20 years. In 1862 he agreed to become an agent of the Serbian government in the Ottoman Empire, and to study the regional Slavic folklore in Macedonia and Thrace. His secret mission was to help Macedonian Slavs to be considered Serb, rather than Greeks, and thus helping to resolve the Eastern Question. Since then, until 1875, Verkovic has regularly sent secret reports to the Serbian government. He regularly supplied also coins from the area to Copenhagen, Paris, London and the Hermitage. Verkoviƒá became then also a member of SANU. During the years he lived in Ottoman Empire, Verkoviƒá proved to be a scientist in the field of folklore, ethnography and geography. He –µstablished intensive contacts with dozens of Bulgarian national movement activists, becoming their associate. After 1868 his close ties with the local Slavic population led him to a progressive dissociation from the official position of Belgrade, that there lived a Serbs. Verkoviƒá issued a collection called \\"Folk songs of the Macedonian Bulgarians\\" in Belgrade in 1860. He noted in the introduction that the title was chosen, because the locals identified themselves as Bulgarian.Ivo Banac, The National Question in Yugoslavia: Origins, History, Politics, Cornell University Press, 1988, , p. 310. In addition, owing to his collector's zeal, Verkovich saved a great number of old manuscripts, coins, objects of art, etc. His main and largest work is \\"Veda Slovena\\" in two volumes, 1874 and 1881.–í–µ–¥–∞ –°–ª–æ–≤–µ–Ω–∞ –∏ –Ω–∞—à–µ—Ç–æ –≤—Ä–µ–º–µ, –ò–≤–∞–Ω –ë–æ–≥–¥–∞–Ω–æ–≤, –ò–∑–¥–∞—Ç–µ–ª –£–Ω–∏–≤–µ—Ä—Å–∏—Ç–µ—Ç—Å–∫–æ –∏–∑–¥-–≤–æ \\"–°–≤. –ö–ª–∏–º–µ–Ω—Ç –û—Ö—Ä–∏–¥—Å–∫–∏\\", 1991, —Å—Ç—Ä. 17. This sensational Slavic Veda contained ‚ÄúBulgarian folk songs of the pre- historical and pre-Christian times, discovered in Thrace and Macedonia‚Äù. During the Russian-Turkish war of 1877-78 he moved to Russia, where he lived till 1891. Nevertheless, the scarcity here urged him to sell some artifacts of his antique collection. In 1891, Verkovic came to Bulgaria and for his merits to the Bulgarian people he was granted a pension for life from the National Assembly. He despaired at the increasing distrust on his life's work, \\"Veda Slovena\\", which many took to be a hoax. With the cooperation of government, he settled in Plovdiv. From here he undertook in 1892 - 1893, two trips among the Pomaks in the Western Rhodopes, trying to prove the authenticity of this Bulgarian folk songs collection. But his mission failed. He prepared a subsequent manuscript to publish also the third volume of \\"Veda Slovena\\". However, without financial support he deceased in Sofia several months later.

The law was sponsored by California Republican and Ventura County native Robert J. Lagomarsino while he represented California's 19th District in the United States House of Representatives. The legislation was cosponsored by Democratic and Republican representatives from districts representing the entirety of the Los Padres National Forest. Signed by President George H.W. Bush, the law designated of new wilderness, expanded existing wilderness by , and designated of new Wild and Scenic Rivers. Most of the areas protected by the law provide habitat for the California condor, a species that was extant only in captivity as of 1987 when all 27 condors left in the world were being kept in California breeding facilities and for which the legislation was named. Six months before the bill was signed into law in 1992, two of the captive California condors were reintroduced into the Sespe Condor Sanctuary, a protected area that would go on to become part of the new Sespe Wilderness in Ventura County, California.  Background  The Los Padres Condor Range and River Protection Act was first introduced to Congress as H.R. 4747 (100th U.S. Congress) by Representative Robert J. Lagomarsino in 1988. This first version of the legislation sought only to establish the Sespe and Matilija Wilderness Areas in addition to expanding the San Rafael Wilderness. Lagomarsino then reintroduced the bill in 1989 as H.R. 1473 (101st U.S. Congress), which was altered from the previous version to also designate the Garcia and San Emigdio Mesa Wilderness Areas while expanding the Ventana Wilderness. This version of the legislation would have also designated portions of Sespe Creek, Sisquoc River, and Big Sur River as Wild and Scenic Rivers. The bill passed the House of Representatives with amendments in October 1989, but never received a floor vote in the Senate. Lagomarsino worked closely with both of California's senators at the time, Democratic Senator Alan Cranston and Republican Senator John F. Seymour, in developing the final bill that would be eventually signed into law. The bill introduced to and eventually passed by both houses of the 102nd U.S. Congress changed from the previous version by also establishing the Chumash and Silver Peak Wilderness Areas, containing no provisions allowing for new directional oil drilling leases under wilderness, and modified language regarding water rights and management of wilderness areas. President George H.W. Bush signed the Los Padres Condor Range and River Protection Act into law in 1992, lauding the legislation for protecting habitat critical to the recovery of the nearly extinct California condor, increasing the amount of national forest lands in California protected under the Wilderness Act of 1964 by 10%, and permanently protecting nearly half of the Los Padres National Forest as wilderness.  Designation of New Wilderness Areas  Five new wilderness areas totaling 316,050 acres were designated within the Los Padres National Forest (although the Sespe Wilderness includes a small portion of the Angeles National Forest ): * Sespe Wilderness - 219,700 acres * Chumash Wilderness - 38,150 acres * Matilija Wilderness - 29,600 acres * Silver Peak Wilderness - 14,500 acres * Garcia Wilderness - 14,100 acres These wilderness areas span Kern, Monterey, San Luis Obispo, Santa Barbara, and Ventura Counties as well as the Los Padres National Forest's Santa Lucia, Monterey, Mount Pinos, and Ojai Ranger Districts  Expansion of Existing Wilderness Areas  Two existing wilderness areas within the Los Padres National Forest were expanded by 84,400 acres: * San Rafael Wilderness - 46,400 acres * Ventana Wilderness - 38,000 acres These wilderness areas span Monterey and Santa Barbara Counties and the Los Padrs National Forest's Santa Barbara, Santa Lucia, and Monterey Ranger Districts.  Designation of Wild and Scenic Rivers  The legislation amended the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act of 1968 to establish 84 miles of three streams within the Los Padres National Forest as new Wild and Scenic Rivers: * Sisquoc River - 33 miles (Wild River) * Sespe Creek - 31.5 miles (4 miles as a Scenic River and 27.5 miles as a Wild River) * Big Sur River - 19.5 miles (Wild River)  Other Provisions  In designating the Sespe Wilderness, the Los Padres Condor Range and River Protection Act also recognized an existing 18-mile trail between Reyes Creek and Lion Campgrounds as the Gene Marshall-Piedra Blanca National Recreation Trail. The legislation established water rights to begin reserving a quantity of water \\"sufficient to fulfill the purposes of this Act.\\" Additionally, the legislation amended the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act of 1968 by adding portions of Piru Creek, Little Sur River, Matilija Creek, Lopez Creek, and Sespe Creek to the list of streams for potential designation as Wild and Scenic Rivers.

() is a 1930 Japanese silent film directed by Shigeyoshi Suzuki, based on the Shingeki play. It was the top-grossing Japanese film of the silent era. Notable as an example of a so-called \\"tendency film\\" with strong anti-capitalist themes, the film inspired a riot in its showing in Tokyo's Asakusa district with media reports of riots in other cities. Plot The plot centers on a schoolgirl, Sumiko (Keiko Takatsu) who has been sent to live with her uncle. Arriving to a harried household with many children, her aunt and alcoholic uncle are annoyed by her arrival. A note, which Sumiko cannot read, announces that her father has killed himself. After being denied schooling and placed into labor for the family, Sumiko is eventually sold to a circus where she suffers at the hands of its members and ringmaster. Sumiko escapes with another circus performer, Shintaro (Ryuujin Unno), but Sumiko joins a team of thieves and ends up arrested. She is given work in the home of a wealthy aristocratic family, who denies even the simplest of pleasures to their staff out of cruelty. She is sent to a Christian orphanage, where she is humiliated for writing a letter to an old friend, and must make a public speech renouncing her ways and accepting Christ into her heart. Given the opportunity, Sumiko instead denounces the church, and ends up burning it down. Cast *Keiko Takatsu as Nakamura Sumiko *Rintar≈ç Fujima as Hiroshi Hasegawa *Ryuujin Unno as Shintaro *Y≈çy≈ç Kojima *Hidekatsu Maki *Itaru Hamada *Takashi Asano *Sabur≈ç Oono Restoration The film, thought to be lost after World War II, was restored in 1997 from a partial print found in the Russian Gosfilmosfond archive in 1994. The restoration added title cards approximating what was known of missing scenes, based on a copy of the director's screenplay provided by his family. These notes were added to the start and finish of the film under supervision of Ota Yoneo. Reception While contemporary criticism of the film includes film historian Donald Richie's perspective that the film is \\"a melodramatic potboiler,\\" the film was a box-office success that lead to increased scrutiny and eventually government censorship of political messaging in films of the era. The film has been compared to radical German theater and Soviet-era propaganda films, though made by a commercial studio which embraced a tendency toward melodrama and vulgarity.

He was also a candidate in the 2017 Somali presidential election. In 2007, Nur played a key role in the reopening of the Somali Embassy in Nairobi, Kenya, which had been closed for 17 years due to the outbreak of the Somali Civil War. He led the campaign that successfully repossessed prime embassy property in Nairobi that had been irregularly sold to private individuals in 1994 after the collapse of the Somalia government. Nur emerged as a symbol of reconciliation in a war-torn Somalia in September 2014 when he unconditionally forgave a man who confessed to being part of a gang that killed his 18-month-old daughter in 1992. Since then, he has sought to use his story to promote reconciliation and peace in Somalia. Early life and education Nur was born on 12 October 1962 in Mogadishu, Somalia, where he spent his childhood. He is the eldest in a family of six siblings. His father, Ali Nur \\"Americo\\", worked as a foreman in a borehole-drilling company. Later, he ran a chain of restaurants and a rental car service in Mogadishu. He also had an interest in real estate. His mother was a housewife who died when he was 9 years old. The nickname \\"Americo\\" was passed to Nur from his father whose fondness for American cowboy hats earned him that sobriquet from his friends, following the Somali tradition for nicknames. Nur received his primary and high school education in Mogadishu. He then proceeded to Montgomery College, Maryland, United States where he studied economics before enrolling at the University of Maryland to further this study. Career and life Upon graduation in 1985, Nur returned to Somalia and in 1986 he began working at the Central Bank of Somalia (CBS) as the head of the accounting department. He also helped to manage his father's chain of businesses in Mogadishu. Nur married and had his first child when he was 26. He served at the Central Bank until the outbreak of the Somali Civil War in 1991 and the collapse of the central government. In 1992, heavily armed men attacked his home in Mogadishu in search of valuables. In the process, his 18-month-old daughter lost her life when a grenade was thrown into the courtyard where she was playing. The deteriorating security situation in Somalia led Nur and his family to relocate to the U.S. where he lived and worked before relocating to Canada in 2000. In 2004, Nur flew to Nairobi at the request of the newly appointed prime minister of the Transitional Federal Government (TFG) of Somalia, Ali Mohamed Ghedi, whose government was initially based in the Kenyan capital. Nur was appointed the director-general of the prime minister's office. In 2006, the TFG relocated to Somalia, first to the south-western town of Baidoa and later to Jowhar, a city in central Somalia, but Nur remained in Nairobi. Along with a team he began efforts to reopen Somalia's embassy that had ceased operations nearly 17 years earlier at the collapse of the government. The embassy was officially reopened in 2006, which was widely welcomed by the Somali nationals in Kenya and around the globe. Nur initially served as Charge-de-Affaires of the embassy. In October 2007, he was appointed the substantive ambassador. He officially started work after presenting his diplomatic credentials to Kenyan President Mwai Kibaki at State House, Nairobi, on 19 October 2007. The position of Somalia envoy to Kenya and Kenya‚ÄìSomalia relations are considered important within Somali political and diplomatic circles, as Kenya is considered a strategic country hosting thousands of Somali refugees and investments by Somali nationals. Nur led efforts to repossess embassy property in Nairobi that had been irregularly sold to private individuals after the collapse of the Somali government. In December 2010, after a three-year court battle, Kenya's High Court ruled in favour of the Somali government. Mohamed Ali Nur with school children at Dadaab refugee complex In 2013, a tripartite agreement was negotiated and signed by Kenya, Somalia, and the United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR), facilitating the voluntary and dignified repatriations of Somali refugees in Kenya. As a result of the agreement, thousands of refugees returned to Somalia while others await repatriation. Nur cited as his other accomplishments increased trade and passenger flights between Somalia and Kenya. During his term, the Somali embassy in Nairobi became the coordination office for United Nations and international NGOs providing humanitarian assistance and support projects inside Somalia. It also provided consular support services for Somali nationals. In 2013, the embassy became the first of Somalia's diplomatic missions to issue a new Somali passport. The embassy also helped Somali refugees obtain documents from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and authenticated education certificates for Somali nationals seeking to study in Kenya. Kenyan troops crossed into Somalia in October 2011, pursuing Somalia-based militant group Al Shabaab. Al Shabaab continued attacks in Kenya at Westgate Mall (September 2013), Mpeketoni (June 2014) and Garissa University College (April 2015). Nur condemned Al Shabaab attacks inside Kenya and called for more cooperation between Kenya and Somalia in tackling the group, while also speaking out against reactionary profiling, harassment and arrests of Somali nationals and ethnic Somalis by Kenyan authorities. Ambassador Nur with Somali nationals in Kenyan custody after mass arrests in mid-2014 following twin bomb blasts in Nairobi After the Westgate Mall attack, Nur mobilized and led Somali nationals in Kenya to donate blood and offer financial and moral support to the victims as a show of solidarity and to ease buildup of communal tensions. Nur served as Somalia's envoy to Kenya until April 2015 before his successor, Gamal Osman, was appointed by Somali President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud. Reconciliation In September 2014, Nur emerged as a symbol of reconciliation in Somalia after he unconditionally forgave a man who confessed to being part of the gang that killed his 18-month-old daughter in 1992 while robbing his home. The man walked to him as he sat with friends at a restaurant in Mogadishu and made the dramatic confession before asking for forgiveness. Nur said that despite the shock, anger, and desire for revenge he felt in his heart, he forgave the man since he showed remorse and had the courage to confess his crime. When the two hugged in reconciliation, they both shed tears. The envoy said that after forgiving his daughter's killer, he felt \\"a huge weight had been lifted off his chest\\". The incident attracted considerable attention among Somali nationals. Soon after the incident, similar stories of killers confessing their past crimes and being forgiven by families of their victims emerged in several parts of Somalia while the subject of national reconciliation and unity dominated public debate. Nur has taken the cause of promoting peace and reconciliation in Somalia. During 2015 and 2016, Nur traveled to different parts of Somalia on a journey he said was to promote peace and reconciliation through a grassroots approach. He dubbed it as the \\"Peace Journey\\" (). Presidential candidate Ambassador Mohamed Ali Nur (centre) with supporters in Mogadishu during his presidential campaign in late 2016 Nur was one of the twenty-one candidates who ran for President of Somalia's Federal Government in the 8 February 2017 election held in Mogadishu. He did not receive enough votes to proceed beyond the first round of voting. He campaigned on the pledge of rebuilding the Somali National Army (SNA) to secure law and order and reduce reliance on external forces serving under the umbrella of the African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM). He also pledged to tackle youth unemployment by creating jobs and educational opportunities, to prevent their recruitment into Al Shabaab or from undertaking dangerous journeys to reach Europe or western countries. He also promised to catalyze grassroots reconciliation by guiding the conversation among different groups of the population.

He was the second of three sons of Auguste, b. Hoffmeister and Robert Gerling, founder of the Cologne-based Gerling insurance company. Hans Gerling joined the Gerling Konzern in 1937 and became CEO in 1949. After the death of Robert Gerling in 1935, management of the Gerling-Konzern, which was the largest privately owned insurance company in Europe, passed first to Walter Forstreuter, then to Hans Gerling's brother Robert Gerling II, and finally, in 1939 when Robert Gerling II emigrated to the United States, to Hans Gerling. At the end of World War II, the US military government allowed the Gerling insurance company to reopen for business with Forstreuter at its head. On November 13, 1948 Forstreuter resigned from the chairmanship in favor of Hans Gerling, who became chairman of all Gerling companies in January 1949. Control of the Gerling insurance group sparked a long legal battle between the three brothers. A settlement provided that Hans Gerling and initially his brother Walter retained the German companies of the Gerling Group, Robert received DM 30 million as compensation and the Swiss and American companies. Hans Gerling initiated the construction of the Gerling skyscraper in Cologne Gereonsviertel, inviting sculptor Arno Breker to participate in the design. It was completed on January 25, 1953. In 1954, Hans Gerling established Gerling-Konzern Globale R√ºckversicherungs-AG, an international reinsurance holding company, and Gerling Globale became the first German insurance company to expand overseas. Gerling founded on April 20, 1954, the Gerling Speziale Kreditversicherungs- AG, which initially operated credit, suretyship and fidelity insurance. After the departure of his youngest brother Walter, Hans Gerling took over in 1965 the sole management. Together with Herbert Quandt and Emil Georg B√ºhrle, Hans Gerling financed Ivan David Herstatt's Herstatt Bank, in which Gerling held a majority share. In 1974, enormous losses at the Herstatt Bank forced Hans Gerling to sell the Gerling insurance business. He later recovered control of the company, which is now run by his son Rolf Gerling. Hans Gerling was inducted into the Insurance Hall of Fame in 2000, alongside Otto Von Bismarck, one of only seven Germans to be so honored in the history of the industry.

Boldoni was born in Bellano and died in Pavia from the plague shortly before his 33rd birthday. At the time of his death he held the principal chair in philosophy at the University of Pavia. His literary works included a description of the geography and history of Lake Como entitled Larius and the epic poem La caduta de' Longobardi (The Fall of the Lombards). His letters of 1629 describing the advance of invading German armies in the region around Lake Como and the plague epidemic they brought in their wake were used by Manzoni as a source for his 1827 novel I Promessi Sposi.

Life Boldoni was one of seven siblings born to a prominent family in Bellano on the shores of Lake Como. His brothers Giovanni Nicol√≤, Ottavio, Flavio, and Aurelio and his sisters Aurelia and Livia all later became writers of some note. Boldoni's mother was Cecilia Cattaneo di Primaluna. His father Ottavio was a jurist and the only son of Nicol√≤ Boldoni, the Italian court physician of Philip II. Little is known about Boldoni's youth. He is thought to have been educated in Como and Milan, and then following in the footsteps of his grandfather he studied medicine and philosophy at the University of Padua.Vescovini, Graziella Federici (1969). \\"Boldoni, Sigismondo\\".

Renaissance Quarterly, Vol. 63, No. 3, pp. 895-896. . Retrieved 12 December 2017 (subscription required for full access). It was the death of his father in 1615 that led to Boldoni enrolling in the University of Padua. A quarrel over their father's inheritance between Boldoni and his brothers Flavio and Aurelio led to Boldoni wounding Flavio with a sword. Although his brothers pardoned him, he remained subject to arrest for attempted fratricide and fled Milan for Padua where he completed his studies in 1618. After leaving Padua, Boldoni spent time in Venice, Pesaro and Urbino before moving to Rome where he lived for the next four years. He became a member of the Accademia degli Umoristi and enjoyed the patronage of Cardinal Roberto Ubaldini and Maffeo Barberini (Pope Urban VIII). He was finally able to return to the Duchy of Milan in 1622. Several prominent members of the Roman Curia and the Milanese senator Giovanni Battista Arconati had successfully intervened with the authorities on his behalf over the incident with his brother. Boldoni was given a teaching position in philosophy at the University of Pavia and in 1623 was accepted into Milan's Noble College of Physicians. By his own confession, Boldoni's passion for writing led to him to devote the minimal amount of his time to teaching in Pavia, and he began writing an epic poem La Caduta dei Longobardi (The Fall of the Lombards). In 1625 he also spent three months in Rome, having travelled there via Bologna and Florence, and continued working on La Caduta dei Longobardi with the encouragement of the poet Alessandro Tassoni. Nevertheless, in 1628 Boldoni was promoted to the most important chair of philosophy at Pavia despite competition from Nicola Sacco who had taught at the university for over thirty years and was considered a renowned authority on Aristotle. Boldoni's literary activity during this time included a lecture on Aristotle's De Caelo, editing Historiae patriae by Benedetto Giovio (the elder brother of Paolo Giovio), and efforts to complete La Caduta dei Longobardi. Boldoni's letters of 1629 written while he was sojourning in Bellano describe the ravages of the advancing German armies in the region around Lake Como and the plague which the soldiers brought in their wake. Two centuries later, the letters would serve as a source for Manzoni's novel I Promessi Sposi. When the plague approached Bellano, Boldoni returned to Pavia. He died there on 3 July 1630, two days before his 33rd birthday. According to the historian Cesare Cant√π, he had contracted the plague from a contaminated suit of clothes brought to him by his tailor. Some 19th-century accounts of his life state that shortly before his death, Boldoni had been appointed to the principal chair of philosophy at the University of Padua. However, doubts have been cast on this because the previous holder of the chair, Cesare Cremonini, died a year later than Boldoni and there are no records of him having retired.Cant√π, Cesare (1832). \\"Ragionamenti di C.

Retrieved 12 December 2017 . Works Frontispiece to the 1656 edition of Boldoni's La caduta de' Longobardi *Larius (Lario). Written in Latin between 1613 and 1615, the book is a description of the geography of Lake Como and was modeled on Paolo Giovio's 1559 Descriptio Larii Lacus. It was first published in Padua in 1617 with a dedication to Ercole Sfondrati, Duke of Montemarciano whom Boldoni credited with having given him the idea for the book. The Sfrondati family also had the fiefdom of Bellagio on Lake Como and owned a large villa there. Boldoni's book had a considerable success and was re-published several times between 1617 and 1776. It was considered remarkable not only for its accurate, detailed descriptions of the geography and landscapes of the area but also for the historical and anthropological descriptions of the settlements and towns bordering the lake and the people who lived there. Larius was published in an annotated translation into modern Italian by Franco Minonzio in 2009 and republished in 2014 under the title Larius: uno sguardo sul Lario di straordinaria modernit√†. *Orationibus Patavii (The Padua Orations). These were three Latin orations which Boldoni delivered while at the University of Padua. The first two were delivered in 1616. One of them was on the relation between art, science, and virtue. The other was a funeral oration for Samuele Geusuffio di Longeloy, the Vice-Rector of the university. Both of these were published in the same volume as Larius in 1617. The third oration, delivered on the departure of Nicol√≤ Vendramin from the Captaincy of Padua in 1618, was published separately. *Apotheosis in morte Philippi III (Apotheosis on the Death of Philip III). Written in Latin to commemorate the death of Philip III, it was published in two editions in 1621, one in Pavia and the other in Antwerp. *Epistolarum Liber (Book of Letters). This was published posthumously in 1651 in a single volume edited and annotated by Boldoni's brother Giovanni Nicol√≤. It consists of 186 letters from Boldoni written in Latin and presented chronologically. It includes the letters written from Bellano in 1629 which served as one of the sources for I Promessi Sposi. A selection of those letters was translated into Italian by Cesare Cant√π and published in 1831. Epistolarum Liber also contains several previously unpublished Latin poems and epigrams by Boldoni, some of which were recited at the meetings of the Accademia degli Umoristi during his sojourns in Rome, and a copy of his Apotheosis in morte Philippi III. *La caduta de' Longobardi (The Fall of the Lombards). Written in Italian, this epic poem by Boldoni in twenty cantos was unfinished at the time of his death. It was published posthumously in 1656 with notes and additions by his brother, Giovanni Nicol√≤, who dedicated it to Cristina, Duchess of Savoy.

His position of choice was preferably a halfback however he was used throughout the backline both provincially and internationally. Although born in Wairoa, in the Hawke's Bay, Corkill was educated at St. Patrick's College in Wellington. He was a member of the 1st XV in 1918.  Career  Corkill played one season for the Wairoa City club in 1923. The next season he transferred to the Wairoa Pirates club where he played until 1927. During this period Corkill represented Hawke's Bay on 31 occasions, with 10 of these being Ranfurly Shield matches. It was in 1925 where he would achieve his All Black status, after being selected to tour Australia, playing against teams from New South Wales. As Don Wright was the preferred halfback in the touring party Corkill was forced to play in other positions. In his four games on tour Corkill played two as a fly-half and the other two at halfback. One of his tour games was the final fixture, against a combined Wellington-Manawatu- Horowhenua side once they had returned to New Zealand. After two more seasons in the Hawke's Bay Corkill moved to Masterton where he joined the Red Star club (now known as Masterton Red Star due to a merge) in 1929. In his two seasons in the Wairarapa he was once again made to play in other backline positions due to fellow Hawke's Bay player Jimmy Mill, also a halfback, making the move at the same time. He totaled 15 matches for the Wairarapa union and one more, in 1930 against the touring British Lions, when the union combined with Bush.

It has a single tubular, dark green leaf and up to fifteen greenish or light brown flowers with a white labellum. It is a very rare orchid with only six plants recorded in 1993. Description Prasophyllum perangustum is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and a single tube-shaped, dark green leaf which is long and wide near its reddish base. The free part of the leaf is long. Between seven and fifteen greenish or light brown flowers are loosely arranged along a flowering spike which is long. The flowers are long and wide and as with other leek orchids, are inverted so that the labellum is above the column rather than below it. The dorsal sepal is lance-shaped to narrow egg- shaped, long, about wide and greenish-brown with red-brown markings. The lateral sepals are linear to narrow lance-shaped, long, about wide and free from each other. The petals are narrow linear, long, about wide and greenish with a central red-brown line. The labellum is white, egg-shaped to lance- shaped, long, about wide and turns sharply upwards through about 90¬∞ near its middle. The edges of the upturned part of the labellum are slightly wavy and there is a thickened, fleshy green, channelled callus in its centre. Flowering occurs in November and December. Taxonomy and naming Prasophyllum perangustum was first formally described in 1998 by David Jones from a specimen collected near Knocklofty and the description was published in Australian Orchid Research. The specific epithet (perangustum) is derived from the Latin word angustum meaning \\"narrow\\" and the prefix per- meaning \\"very\\" referring to the very narrow labellum tip and callus. Distribution and habitat The Knocklofty leek orchid is only known from a single location near Knocklofty where it grows on steep slopes and ridges with grasses and shrubs in open forest. Conservation Prasophyllum perangustum was last seen in 1993 when six plants were recorded. It is classed as \\"Endangered\\" under the Tasmanian Threatened Species Protection Act 1995 and as Critically Endangered under the Commonwealth Government Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC) Act. The main threats to the population are weed invasion, inappropriate fire regimes and track maintenance.

He played a significant part in the practical implementation of British colonial rule in the coastal areas of Queensland. His role as an officer in the Native Police was central in a number of important moments in colonial Queensland history including that of the brutal crushing of localised Aboriginal resistance after the Hornet Bank massacre, the foundation of Rockhampton and the creation of the Bowen settlement. He also had major contributions in the founding of Cardwell, the coastal and South Seas trade, and the British colonisation of the Torres Strait. Early life Powell was born in Bampton, Oxfordshire in 1831 to Walter Posthumus and Matilda Pearl Powell. His full name was Walter Frederick David Taylor Powell. In 1838, his father was employed by the East India Company as an Archdeacon and consequently the Powell family moved to Madras. After three years there Walter returned to England for schooling. He was not academically inclined and chose a career at sea instead of finishing his formal education. He became a teenage midshipsman on various vessels including the Sutlej and the Vernon. In 1852, he arrived in the Australian city of Melbourne as third mate aboard trading vessel of Green & Co. The Victorian gold rush was occurring at this time, and Powell absconded from his ship to become a digger at Castlemaine, Victoria. He acquired not much more than dysentery and returned to England. After failing in an attempt to join the Turkish Navy he returned to Melbourne in 1853 to try his luck on the Bendigo goldfields. His prospecting attempts again were poor. Trooper in the Gold Escort At the time of his presence at Bendigo, the local government were reforming the armed escorts of the transportations of gold from the various diggings to Melbourne. The shooting of the McIvor gold escort in 1853 prompted this reorganisation and Powell was employed as a member of the reformed Gold Escort. He worked the Beechworth to Melbourne route from 1853 to 1855. Shipwreck of the Reindeer In 1855, Powell wished to again return to England, this time with the view of enlisting in the Crimean War. He joined the crew of the vessel Reindeer which departed Melbourne in August 1855. On the 5th of September, the Reindeer ran aground on Pocklington Reef in the Louisiade Archipelago. The 19 crew members managed to stock and launch the longboat from the stricken vessel and initially sailed to mainland New Guinea but felt threatened by the Indigenous people they encountered there and so decided to head south on the prevailing winds to the nearest safe British port they knew of in Moreton Bay. They started to run low on provisions at Lizard Island and subsequently went ashore at Cape Grafton to obtain food and water from the Aboriginals they observed there. Two crewmen decided to stay with the local people, but after a violent disagreement, they returned to the longboat just as it was departing with the other crew members firing upon the locals. The longboat made its way down the eastern coast of Australia, stopping where it could to obtain supplies of food and water resulting in further conflict with Aboriginals. On the 25th of November, they arrived in Port Curtis and were surprised to find the fledgling British outpost of Gladstone where they became re-acquainted with European civilisation. Officer in the Native Police The settlement of Port Curtis, at this stage, was on the frontier of the British invasion of north-eastern Australia and as a result there were several detachments of the paramilitary Native Police stationed there. The Native Police were a force of Aboriginal troopers under the command of British officers deployed with the purpose of eliminating indigenous resistance to British occupation. Lieutenant John Murray of the Native Police was present at Port Curtis when Powell and the other shipwrecked crew members arrived. As officers in the Native Police were in short supply during this period, Powell agreed to Murray's offer of being enlisted as a sub-Lieutenant into the force in December 1855. Formation of the Rockhampton township In June 1856, sub-Lieutenant Powell was called upon to escort Richard Palmer from Gladstone to the Fitzroy River, about 100 km to the north-west. Palmer wanted to establish a store at the tidal boundary of this river where the Archer brothers were transporting the wool from their newly established Gracemere property. Powell and his section of troopers travelled there and built a barracks, which became the first habitable dwelling of the colonial British township of Rockhampton. The barracks were located at what is now Col Brown Park at the end of Albert St near the river. Richard Palmer's shop was the second or third dwelling built and was located at the bottom of present-day Fitzroy St next to the Criterion Hotel. At the request of the Archer brothers for more armed protection against local Aboriginal confrontation, Powell later shifted his troopers to Gracemere. Punitive missions after the Hornet Bank Massacre In 1857, Powell was promoted to Lieutenant in the Native Police and transferred to the Eurombah barracks on the Dawson River. In October 1857, the Hornet Bank massacre occurred, where eleven settlers and station-hands were killed in a counter- offensive by local Yiman tribespeople. As the Hornet Bank property was not far from Eurombah, Lieutenant Powell was one of the first colonial law enforcers notified of the attack. He mustered his troopers and travelled to Hornet Bank where he immediately utilised his force to track down and kill five Aboriginals residing in the hills to the west of the property. A second, larger punitive expedition was organised with the participation of armed local settlers, including William Fraser whose family members figured prominently in the casualties of the massacre at Hornet Bank. On this mission, they shot dead a further nine people. By December 1857 Powell had increased the number of troopers in his division to seventeen, which he put to use by conducting raids on peaceful \\"station blacks\\" at Taroom, killing five including three native women as they tried to flee. Powell with William Fraser and 2nd-Lieutenant Robert G. Walker led another raid at Juandah shooting dead another eleven Aboriginals. By April 1858, other divisions of Native Police led by Commandant Edric Norfolk Vaux Morisset and including the sections of John Murray, John O'Connell Bligh, George Murray, Charles Phibbs, William Moorhead and Frederick Carr had become active in the area, conducting raids of indiscriminate summary justice. Henry Gregory and his brother, the explorer A.C. Gregory were also involved in the punitive expeditions as they were squatters in the area. In his memoirs, local pastoralist George Serocold wrote that a dozen local black men who were considered leaders in the region at that time were rounded up and then ordered to run through an open field. As they fled they were shot dead by those who had ordered them to run. Both the colonial government funded Native Police and other privately funded death squads continued to conduct patrols and punitive missions throughout the area for around the next twelve months. In 1860, Powell applied for leave from the force and during this period he married Elizabeth Hitchcock in East Maitland. The Fanny Briggs scandal In late 1860, Powell returned to active duty in the Native Police and was based at the Princhester barracks about 60 kilometres north of the new Native Police headquarters outside Rockhampton on Murray's Lagoon near modern-day Rockhampton Airport. Lieutenant John Murray had established the headquarters here, hence the lagoon being named after him. In November, a white barmaid by the name of Fanny Briggs was raped and murdered in the area. Initially, a group of Aboriginals camped near Gracemere were chosen to be the convenient culprits. Commandant Morisset and Lieutenant Murray with their troopers went out to punish this group. At least two aboriginals were shot dead at Raglan Creek, although there were reports that an indiscriminate slaughter occurred here. A settler's reminiscences of Raglan detail how the skulls of shot Aboriginals provided an \\"ornamental border\\" for a garden bed, although these skulls may have been obtained from a previous massacre led by Lieutenant John Murray in 1856. Despite these summary executions, suspicion then turned to four Native police troopers Toby, Gulliver, Johnny Reid and Alma, who were subsequently arrested. Gulliver was coerced into a confession and offered to show the authorities further evidence at Scrubby Creek near modern-day Fairy Bower. While leading some civil policemen there, Gulliver managed to escape. Powell and some of his other more reliable troopers were ordered to recapture him and after finding him near Wowan, they finally seized him after some cattlemen had detained him at a crossing on the nearby Dee River. Gulliver, although he was restrained and almost unconscious with inebriation, was shot dead by Lieutenant Powell \\"in order to prevent his escape\\". The waterhole his body was dumped in is still called Gulliver's Waterhole. The other arrested troopers met a similar fate. Toby \\"disappeared\\" after being escorted into the bush by some troopers, while Alma was shot dead at a riverbank by his captor while \\"trying to escape\\" despite being in leg-irons and handcuffs. Johnny Reid was found not guilty at trial and was released. In 1861, as part of a whitewashed government enquiry into the Native Police, Powell and his fellow officers came under scrutiny for these extrajudicial killings of Aboriginal troopers and non-combatants but nothing came of it and Powell continued his career in this paramilitary force without any official censure. This was despite a number of members of the Queensland Legislative Assembly calling for Powell to be dismissed. The President of the Assembly also verified that Powell had \\"dealt in the same way with a blackfellow\\" on his station, calling him a murderer. Foundation of the Bowen and Cardwell townships In early 1861, the Commissioner for Crown Lands in the Kennedy District, George Elphinstone Dalrymple led a large overland force to establish a British settlement at Port Dension. His force consisted of a Native Police division under the command of Lieutenant Williams. To augment this force, Dalrymple also sent a section of Native Police troopers on board the two ships which contained the settlers travelling to the area at the same time. This naval contingent was under the command of Lieutenant Powell. This two-pronged strike upon the area known to have several communities of Aboriginals in existence there, was planned so that it \\"would either strike terror, which would result in immediate flight, or enable a blow to be struck\\" upon these inhabitants. The plan had the desired effect with the Aboriginals fleeing from the site as both forces joined up. This British settlement was initially called Port Denison, but in 1864 it become officially known as Bowen. Powell remained in the area with his troopers and formed a barracks just outside of the settlement. He was briefly discharged from his position after a disagreement with Dalrymple but was soon re-appointed. Powell conducted several punitive missions in the area, including the clearance of Aboriginals from Strathmore, the first pastoral property formed in the region. This property was set up by Philip Frederic Sellheim and is still in existence, located on the Bowen River near Collinsville. During another of these sorties against the local Indigenous people, Powell captured a shipwrecked white man who had been living with the native people for seventeen years. His name was James Morrill and even though Powell thought he was a ringleader of the resistance to British occupation, Morrill later became an appreciated member of Bowen society before his death in 1865. Powell was also stationed with his Native Police troopers at nearby Whitsunday Island to protect the timber operations of Eugene Fitzalan. This timber was used to construct the first British structures at Bowen. After the killing of a squatter and sailor at nearby Shaw Island by Aboriginals, Powell was the first officer notified. However, the subsequent punitive expedition was led by George Elphinstone Dalrymple and Lieutenant Williams. In 1862, Powell was appointed harbourmaster at Bowen. Powell held the position as the head of the local Native Police in conjunction with the harbourmaster role until March 1863 when he retired from the force. Lieutenant Marlow replaced Powell as the local Native Police officer in Bowen. Powell continued as harbourmaster at Bowen until 1864, when he became captain of the schooner Policeman. One of his first voyages as captain and owner of this vessel was to conduct another expedition of settlement led by George Elphinstone Dalrymple in 1864. This time it was to found the township of Cardwell in Rockingham Bay. Powell took Dalrymple and his party including James Morrill and Lieutenant Marlow with his Native Police troopers in the Policeman from Bowen and landed them in the area and, despite Aboriginals in the area conveying their displeasure, the establishment of Cardwell was proclaimed. Coastal and South Seas trader Powell only remained captain of the Policeman for a short time after the founding of Cardwell. He became employed by the Australasian Steam Navigation Company and was chief officer of the Telegraph before transferring as captain to the Sarah Barr which was wrecked at Trial Bay in 1866. Powell was a maritime officer upon various vessels trading along the coast and out to the South Pacific islands up until 1874, and it appears that he was involved the Blackbirding industry. Native Police and Water Police duties on Cape York In 1874, Powell accepted a position as chief of the Water Police and Native Police at the Cape York outpost of Somerset. He was involved in maintaining order in the operation of the pearling industry and shipping through the Torres Strait. He worked there until 1878, dealing with various duties including salvaging shipwrecks. Signaller and Lighthouse keeper In 1878, with the imminent closure of the Somerset settlement and transfer of officials to Thursday Island in the Torres Strait, Powell was took up a position as a signalman on nearby Goode Island. In 1887 he was transferred to Cape Moreton as a lighthouse keeper, and in 1900 he was further transferred to Double Island Point lighthouse. Death and Legacy Walter Frederick David Taylor Powell died at his residence of 44 George St, Kangaroo Point on the 23rd of December 1906. His coffin was draped in the Union Jack and one of his pallbearers was fellow harbourmaster and blackbirder, John Mackay. He is buried at Balmoral Cemetery, Brisbane. Powell had married twice. His first wife, Elizabeth (Lita) died in 1873 and he married his second wife, Eliza Finigan, in 1874. He had twelve children. Former Queensland state National Party politician and Minister of Education in Joh Bjelke-Peterson's government, Lin Powell, is a great grandson of Walter Powell. Powell Street in Bowen is also named after him.

The hospital currently operates under the administration of Shrimad Rajchandra Love and Care, a non-governmental organisation (NGO) which runs the hospital and other charitable activities. Established in 2003, provides medical care at nominal rates or completely free of cost. Hospital records show that over 125,000 patients were treated in 2016, and over 1 million patients have been treated since the inception of the hospital in 2004. SRH has also been the recipient of several awards and accolades from institutions such as the Government of Gujarat. In addition to providing medical services, Shrimad Rajchandra Hospital aims to spread awareness about critical health issues to the rural population in neighbouring areas. The hospital currently has a capacity of 55 beds, with an ongoing construction plan expected to increase the capacity to 250 beds. History and Organization Shrimad Rajchandra Hospital was established on 14 April 2003 (on the day of Mahavir Jayanti) by Pujya Gurudevshri Rakeshbhai, the founder of Shrimad Rajchandra Mission, Dharampur. The hospital was set-up in two distinct phases - during the first phase of development, only allopathic and homeopathic dispensaries were operational. By the end of the second phase, which was completed in July 2004, the hospital was fully operational and was offering complete medical services. Facilities and Current Operations The main campus of Shrimad Rajchandra Hospital is located at Mohangad, in the city of Dharampur. The hospital's neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) handles over 500 cases annually. As on November 2015, the hospital had a total staff of 125 persons, including clinical and non-clinical staff members. Although the hospital was initially set-up to provide secondary level care, it now provides certain services and facilities usually available in tertiary level hospitals. The hospital functions as a charitable hospital and offers all of its services at highly subsidised or free rates. Under the hospital's policy, all patients who are unable to afford treatments or who are uninsured, are provided with medical care free of charge. SRH offers a wide range of services through its departments of obstetrics and gynaecology, paediatrics and neonatology, urology, pathology, dermatology, prosthetics and orthotics, physiotherapy, and dentistry. The hospital also has two general operating theatres and a 24-hour emergency operating theatre. From the period of July 2004 to March 2015, over 5,300 recorded surgeries have been completed at Shrimad Rajchandra Hospital. The hospital also offers services such as a 24-hour emergency service and emergency operating theatre, a 24-hour cardiac ambulance service, a blood storage unit, and a fully equipped medical store. Some of the hospital's other services include: * Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) and Shrimad Rajchandra District Early Intervention Centre The hospital's NICU treats over 500 cases annually, and is one of the most advanced and well-equipped facilities in the district of Valsad. After recovering from the NICU, infants in need of early intervention procedures are referred to the Shrimad Rajchandra District Early Intervention Centre (SRDEIC) for further treatment. The SRDEIC was established in January 2011 and has been recognised as a model centre by the Government of Gujarat. Through a Memorandum of Understanding signed between the Government of Gujarat and SRH in December 2014, the SRDEIC has been appointed to train staff of other early invention centres. * Shrimad Rajchandra Viklang Centre (SRVC) The only centre of its kind in the Valsad district, the SRVC provides holistic rehabilitation services for the physically and neurologically challenged. Established in January 2011, the centre offers consultations with orthopaedics, neuro-physicians, speech therapists, and physiotherapists. SRVC also organises outreach camps through which medical care is provided at the doorstep of patients in remote and typically inaccessible areas. As of November 2015, more than 40 such camps had been conducted through which cover 1,200 patients benefited. SRVC works in partnerships with various other NGOs such as Bhansali trust, BAIF's associate organization, DHRUVA (Dharampur Uttham Vahini), JNPCT (Jashoda Narottam Public Charity Trust) and ARCH (Action Research in Community Health). It also works with government run Primary Health Centres (PHCs) and anganwadis. * Shrimad Rajchandra Child Malnutrition Treatment Centre (SRCMTC) Started in November 2015, the Shrimad Rajchandra Child Malnutrition Treatment Centre (SRCMTC) provides medical services to severely undernourished children. Patients are typically provided with nutrition and essential supplements under direct medical supervision at the centre. * Shrimad Rajchandra Health Education Centre for Adolescents (SRHECA) As part of its aim to spread basic health awareness, the hospital started the Shrimad Rajchandra Health Education Centre for Adolescents (SRHECA) in November 2015. The SRHECA holds regular workshops and lectures for adolescent girls in order to prepare them for a safe and healthy motherhood. * Shrimad Rajchandra Mobile Dental Clinic Similar to the outreach camps conducted by SRVC, the hospital also organises regular visits of a mobile dental van to remote areas of Valsad. Qualified dentists provide dental care and help to patients at their doorstep and refer the patients to SRH if further specialised treatment is necessary. Private-Public Partnerships with the Government of India The hospital continues to receive support from the government through multiple private-public partnerships. In December 2006, SRH was registered under the Chiranjeevi Scheme of the Government of Gujarat, under which the government supports hospitals that provide free medical services for pregnant women. In 2009, the Government of Gujarat introduced the Bal Sakha Scheme under which infants born to families below the poverty line (BPL) are treated free of cost. SRH has been a participating hospital in this scheme since its inception. SRH is also participant in the Government of Gujarat's Sarva Shiksa Abhiyan (SSA). Through the SSA, students with physical disabilities are referred to hospitals for further consultations and treatment. Several students from the areas of Valsad, Surat, and Surendranagar, have been referred through the SSA to Shrimad Rajchandra Viking Centre (SRVC), one of the hospital's departments. Under the Government of India's ADIP (Assistance to Disabled Persons), SRH receives a grant-in-aid for supplying artificial limbs and appliances for the rehabilitation of physically challenged persons. SRH was also one of the first hospitals that was authorised to treat patients under the Government of India's Rashtriya Swasthya Bima Yojna (RSBY). The RSBY scheme, launched by the Ministry of Labour and Employment, provides health insurance coverage for underprivileged families living below the poverty line (BPL). Under this scheme, admitted patients receive treatment and medicines up to Rs. 30,000 free of charge. The hospital has also signed a series of Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) agreements with the Government of Gujarat. In September 2015, SRH signed an MoU with the Government of Gujarat which requires SRH to provide tertiary- level healthcare services to mothers referred to or approaching the hospital. A similar MoU was signed in 2014, which mandates SRH to provide tertiary-level care for newborn babies and infants referred to the hospital. Another MoU signed in December 2015 mandates SRH's Shrimad Rajchandra District Early Intervention Centre (SRDEIC) to train staff of other early intervention centres. Awards and Recognition In April 2011, Shrimad Rajchandra Hospital was the second hospital in the district of Valsad to be awarded status of a First Referral Unit (FRU) by the Government of Gujarat. This status is granted to hospitals that are fully equipped to provide round-the-clock services such as Emergency Obstetric Care, Newborn Care and Emergency Care. In April 2013, SRH was presented with an aware for ‚ÄòExcellence in Real Health Care‚Äô at the Medscape India National Awards. The award was in recognition of the significant contribution of SRH in field of rural healthcare services. In December 2015, the Government of Gujarat recognised SRH's District Early Intervention Centre (SRDEIC) as the first model centre. The Government and SRH also signed an MoU which mandates SRH to train staff of other early invention centres. Fundraising Activities Shrimad Rajchandra Love and Care has been participating in the Standard Chartered Mumbai Marathon since 2011. It has been the highest fund-raising NGO for seven consecutive years collecting approximately 77.26 lakh in 2011, 96.92 lakh in 2012, 1.38 crore in 2013, 1.5 crore in 2014\\"STANDARD CHARTERED MUMBAI MARATHON 2014 CHARITY AWARDS\\" Retrieved 8 June 2014. 1.6 crore in 2015. 2.56 crore in 2016. 3.83 crore in 2017.

On June 27, her body was found by a fisherman, floating in the San Joaquin River east of Antioch, California near its bridge, east of San Francisco. On December 11, 2017, after extensive DNA analysis, 63-year-old Mitchell Lynn Bacom, a convicted sex offender, was arrested as the prime suspect. He has been charged with kidnapping, rape, oral copulation, murder, and murder with use of a deadly weapon. This was Antioch's oldest cold case murder. At the time of Bombardier's homicide, Bacom was known to her family. Bombardier was raped, stabbed in the chest, and her heart was punctured. She was kidnapped from her sister's townhome in Antioch while she was babysitting her nieces. Her sister, Stephanie Mullen, arrived home at 4:00 a.m. to find Bombardier missing. Bombardier's father, Ted, said that she knew her killer, as there was no forced entry.  Background  Fourteen-year-old Bombardier was an honor roll student at Antioch Junior High at the time of her homicide. She also belonged to the California Junior Scholastic Federation. She was buried at Queen of Heaven Cemetery in Lafayette. Jennifer Kathleen Gibbons came across her grave in 2014 and started blogging about the unsolved case. This kept it top of mind for the public and later for investigators. Bacom's mug shot, 1974 Bacom's California driver's license photo In 2015, DNA samples from Bombardier's case were sent to the San Mateo County Sheriff's Office Forensic Laboratory for them to create a DNA profile. In early 2017, after advancements in DNA analysis technology, Antioch police were notified that a CODIS hit was made that tentatively identified Bacom as the perpetrator. After additional testing, when the samples were conclusively linked to Bacom through a federal DNA database, he was taken into custody without incident at his home. In 1973 Bacom was tried for several crimes, convicted, and sentenced to five years to life imprisonment. In 1981 he was convicted for several more crimes and sentenced to 24 years in prison. In 2002 he failed to register as a sex offender and was sentenced to four years in prison.  Suspect  Mitchell Lynn Bacom (born March 21, 1954) is a native of Knightsen, California. He has brown eyes, and brown hair. He is 5'7\\", and weighs 185 pounds. He was a suspect in the case for a long time. Authorities will attempt to match Bacom's DNA to other cold cases.

This concept and its notation were formulated by Andr√°s Gy√°rf√°s. The use of the Greek letter chi in the term \\\\chi-bounded is based on the fact that the chromatic number of a graph G is commonly denoted \\\\chi(G). Nontriviality It is not true that the family of all graphs is \\\\chi-bounded. As and showed, there exist triangle-free graphs of arbitrarily large chromatic number, so for these graphs it is not possible to define a finite value of t(3). Thus, \\\\chi- boundedness is a nontrivial concept, true for some graph families and false for others. Specific classes Every class of graphs of bounded chromatic number is (trivially) \\\\chi-bounded, with c(t) equal to the bound on the chromatic number. This includes, for instance, the planar graphs, the bipartite graphs, and the graphs of bounded degeneracy. Complementarily, the graphs in which the independence number is bounded are also \\\\chi-bounded, as Ramsey's theorem implies that they have large cliques. Vizing's theorem can be interpreted as stating that the line graphs are \\\\chi-bounded, with c(t)=t. The claw-free graphs more generally are also \\\\chi-bounded with c(t)\\\\le (t-1)^2. This can be seen by using Ramsey's theorem to show that, in these graphs, a vertex with many neighbors must be part of a large clique. This bound is nearly tight in the worst case, but connected claw-free graphs that include three mutually-nonadjacent vertices have even smaller chromatic number, c(t)=2(t-1). Other \\\\chi-bounded graph families include: *The perfect graphs, with c(t)=t-1 *The graphs of boxicity two *The graphs of bounded clique-width *The intersection graphs of scaled and translated copies of any compact convex shape in the plane *The circle graphs, and (generalizing circle graphs) the \\"outerstring graphs\\", intersection graphs of bounded curves in the plane that all touch the unbounded face of the arrangement of the curves However, although intersection graphs of convex shapes, circle graphs, and outerstring graphs are all special cases of string graphs, the string graphs themselves are not \\\\chi-bounded. They include as a special case the intersection graphs of line segments, which are also not \\\\chi-bounded. Unsolved problems According to the Gy√°rf√°s‚ÄìSumner conjecture, for every tree T, the graphs that do not contain T as an induced subgraph are \\\\chi-bounded. For instance, this would include the case of claw-free graphs, as a claw is a special kind of tree. However, the conjecture is known to be true only for certain special trees, including paths and radius-two trees.

Equivalently, it asks whether the T-free graphs are \\\\chi-bounded. It is named after Andr√°s Gy√°rf√°s and David Sumner, who formulated it independently in 1975 and 1981 respectively. It remains unproven. In this conjecture, it is not possible to replace T by a graph with cycles. As Paul Erd≈ës and Andr√°s Hajnal have shown, there exist triangle-free graphs with arbitrarily large chromatic number and, at the same time, arbitrarily large girth. Using these graphs, one can obtain graphs that avoid any fixed choice of a cyclic graph and clique (of more than two vertices) as induced subgraphs, and exceed any fixed bound on the chromatic number. The conjecture is known to be true for certain special choices of T, including paths, stars, and trees of radius two. It is also known that, for any tree T, the graphs that do not contain a subdivision of T are \\\\chi-bounded.

The school is operated by the NSW Department of Education; the principal is Anne Vine.  Curriculum  Students in Years 7-12 study subjects as determined by the NSW Education Standards Authority (NESA). In Years 7‚Äì8, students study the mandatory subjects, with the Language Other Than English option being Japanese. Classes are also offered in STEAM/Biosciences, WRAD (Literacy), Digital Technology and Careers. In Years 9-10, students choose three elective subjects, in addition to the mandatory curriculum. A wide range of subjects are offered, with student choice being a key factor in determining final selections. Students in Years 11-12 are able to choose from a wide range of courses, with English being the only compulsory area of study. Additionally, students can undertake VET in Construction, Hospitality and/or Music Industry or participate in a School Based Apprenticeship (SBAT) program, giving them dual qualifications at the HSC level.  History  The opening of Kariong Mountains High school was the result of a consistent and determined effort over two decades by a group of community citizens determined to provide a high school for their children. As a result of this effort, a 7-12 high school was built in the grounds of Mt Penang Parklands. The Kariong area features temperate rainforest. Trees in the vicinity of Kariong Mountains High School support hollow dependent native fauna species including nocturnal mammals such as possums and gliders, microbats and some bird species such as parrots, cockatoos and wood ducks. Mature native trees would have been logged in the area throughout the 19th century. For most of the 20th century, the high school site and the adjacent Mount Penang Parklands were part of a much larger site that accommodated an institution for the care, control and rehabilitation of delinquent and destitute boys. Originally known as the Gosford Farm Home for Boys, the institution was established in 1911 on 681 acres of temperate rainforest at the summit of Penang Mountain, four kilometres west of Gosford. In 1946, the institution was renamed the Mount Penang Training School for Boys, reflecting a new emphasis on vocational training for rehabilitation. It became the Mount Penang Juvenile Justice Centre in 1991, but was closed and relocated to the new purpose-built Frank Baxter Centre in 1999. The Festival Development Corporation took over most the site at this time, and renamed it Mount Penang Parklands. The High School site was excised from the Festival Development Corporation in 2008. Most of the Parklands, including the Kariong High School site, are listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register.

It runs mainly in north-south direction and is currently used by the two subway lines, the U3 and U6. Also, since 15 December 2013, the additional amplifier line, the U8, runs on Saturdays on the section Olympiazentrum-Scheidplatz. Between the subway stations M√ºnchner Freiheit and Implerstra√üe, the lines U3 and U6 run on the same route, before, or after which they branch off and the two lines are then run each on a separate route. The mainline 1 has a total length of 41 kilometers and passes 42 subway stations. It does not run exclusively in Munich urban areas, but for a distance of about eight kilometers in the northern area of Garching. A large part of the northern section of the U6 runs above ground, the remaining part completely in tunnels. On 19 October 1971, the operation was recorded on the first main line with the U6 line. In the following years, twelve expansions or extensions were put into operation at irregular intervals. Most recently, the section between the subway stations Olympia-Einkaufszentrum and Moosach was opened in 2010. An extension from Gro√ühadern to Martinsried is planned, but a construction start has not been set.  History  The U6 runs on the oldest Munich subway route. The Lindwurmtunnel (section between Sendlinger Tor, including Goetheplatz station) was built as early as 1938-41 as part of a north-south rapid-transit railway line, which is essentially today's course of the U6. For this reason, the Goetheplatz station is a few meters longer than the usual 120 meter platform length, since it was designed for other trains. The tunnel was integrated into the construction of the U6 route from 1 February 1965. Starting on 19 October 1971, the first trains drove between Kieferngarten and Goetheplatz. The construction of the U3 line was drastically accelerated when Munich was awarded the contract for the 1972 Summer Olympics in the mid-1960s. In 1966, the line network plan adopted only a year earlier was revised and the U3 was defined as a feeder to the Olympic site, since the originally planned route over the main station could not be realized in the short time. In addition, the direct connection to the technical base located in Fr√∂ttmaning was considered necessary for the operation. The stations, which were not already put into operation in the course of the opening of the U6 (Bonner place to Olympia center), were opened on 8 May 1972. On 22 November 1975, the stops Implerstra√üe and Harras were opened. Already at that time the Implerstrasse station was built as a junction station, although the southern branch of the U3 only came into operation 14 years later. The U3 ended at Harras, where there was now a second transfer possibility to the S-Bahn. The Poccistra√üe station, between Goetheplatz and Implerstra√üe, was built later on and opened on 28 May 1978. The section through Partnachplatz and Westpark to Holzapfelkreuth was opened for the International Horticultural Exhibition (IGA) on 16 April 1983 as a flower line. The design of the three stations, which follows the same basic pattern, was awarded the International Design Prize 1983/84. The southern branch of the route was only advanced in the 1980s. From 28 October 1989, it was possible to travel from the Implerstrasse underground station to the former end terminal of Forstenrieder Allee. As a result, the section between Implerstra√üe and Holzapfelkreuth was no longer served by the U3. On 1 June 1991, the present end terminal F√ºrstenried West was reached. The previous tram line 16 (Harras - Ratzingerplatz - F√ºrstenried) had served its purpose and was constructed and extended in stages. Further route extensions in the south to the Klinikum Gro√ühadern (on 22 May 1993) and in the north to Fr√∂ttmaning (on 30 June 1994) and further to Garching- Hochbr√ºck (on 28 October 1995) followed. For the connection of the Allianz Arena, the Fr√∂ttmaning station was rebuilt between 10 October 2002 and 4 May 2005. The station was moved about half a platform length to the north, the existing platform was demolished, a second platform was built and north of the now four-track station, a new parking facility built. The current station is completely roofed in and now also has an access at the northern end, which connects directly to the esplanade of the Allianz Arena. For a long time, Freimann was the last subway station, which was not wheelchair accessible. Since August 2006, three elevators have been retrofitted, so that since June 2009, this station is easily accessible for mobility-impaired people. The Garching area route runs past the Garching Research Center, through Garching and Garching-Hochbr√ºck, just about up to Fr√∂ttmaning Station, and was built by the City of Garching with financial aid from the Free State of Bavaria and the Munich district, and opened on 14 October 2006. MVG is commissioned with the operation and lease track facilities, railway stations and two long-distance trains from Garching. Until 2007, the U3 line ended in the north of the city at the Olympiazentrum station. At the end of October 2007, the two stations, Oberwiesenfeld and Olympia-Einkaufszentrum, were opened. In December 2010, the extension through the Moosacher St.-Martins Square to Moosach was opened, and connected to the S1.  Course   North (U3)  Olympiazentrum M√ºnchner Freiheit In the north, since December 2010, the U3 starts at the Moosach station. Via the Moosacher St.-Martins-Platz, the route leads to the Olympia- Einkaufszentrum station, where the U1 begins. Via the Oberwiesenfeld station, which surrounds the northern part of the Olympic Park, the four-track Olympiazentrum station is reached, where the U3, from 1972 to 2007 had its northern endpoint. For the current Olympiazentrum station, was temporarily the name Oberwiesenfeld provided, which is why in the route schedules Olympiazentrum (Oberwiesenfeld) can be found. To preserve the original name of the district in the cityscape, the working title Olympiapark North was discarded. Via the Petuelring station, the Scheidplatz is reached, where a connection to the U2 can be made from the same opposing platform at the same time. Via Bonner Platz, the M√ºnchner Freiheit station is reached, where the route joins the common U3 / U6 main line. The four stations Olympiazentrum, Petuelring, Scheidplatz and Bonner Platz, are all made of exposed concrete with reliefs on the walls, while the orange color for the U3 is reflected in the line band and other architecture in the station. They deviate in form and design quite strongly from the basic form of the, only shortly before planned and executed stations of the U6, - due to the Olympic decision and the associated reputation justifying an independent appearance of the stations.  North (U6)  Fr√∂ttmaning M√ºnchner Freiheit The U6 begins underground in the north at the Garching Research Center, the section from Garching to Garching Hochbr√ºck was opened on 14 October 2006. The station at Forschungszentrum, which is located at a low elevation, connects the adjacent research center to it by rail for the first time, shortly thereafter the U6 comes to the surface for about 500 meters. After this short aboveground section, the 17-meter-deep tunnel station Garching is reached, located under the Garching Maibaumplatz. Then the track comes to light again shortly before Garching-Hochbr√ºck. The section between Garching-Hochbr√ºck and the next station, rebuilt for the Allianz Arena, Fr√∂ttmaning, is about 4.1 km and the longest section between two stations in the Munich network. This section also underpasses the Munich Highway ring. In Fr√∂ttmaning, the technical base with the main workshop of the Munich subway is located. From the Kieferngarten station, which is four-lane due to the connection to the technical base and the associated entry and exit trips, the line leads over the 450-meter-long Heidemann bridge to the Freimann station, which is located directly next to the A9 highway. Which is crossed underground, like the Frankfurter Ring and the Munich North Ring, to which a track connection occurs at this point. The next station, Studentenstadt, is located next to the Ungererstra√üe, whose course the track now follows. After Studentenstadt, the U6 disappears for the rest of its course, underground. The three following stations designed by Paolo Nestler, Alte Heide, Nordfriedhof (next to Garching-Hochbr√ºck the only station with side train entry on the U6) and Dietlindenstra√üe, are all under the Ungererstra√üe. The Nordfriedhof station is also located below the Mittlerer Ring. The track then connects in the M√ºnchner Freiheit station to the common U3 / U6 main line.  Center (U3 and U6)  Construction work for a relief tunnel at MarienplatzSendlinger Tor Parallel platform on Marienplatz; between the black pillars are passages to the actual platform After Giselastra√üe and Universit√§t, the U3 crosses the U4 and U5 lines at Odeonsplatz. Since their route was planned later, the south end of the station had to be extensively rebuilt. From the new lower platform, staircases were built both directly to the entry floor and to the existing platform. This corridor is a serious bottleneck in the busy dual station. At the Marienplatz station, designed by Alexander von Branca, the S-Bahn lines S1-S8 are crossed, and due to the occupation and stadium traffic, it is often overloaded. The station is the busiest in the entire metro network. Therefore, and in view of the 2006 Football World Cup, the city council decided that \\"under its feet\\", directly under the town hall, two additional pedestrian tunnels should help equalize the crowd. The extension was inaugurated on 29 May 2006. At the Sendlinger Tor, the U1 and U2 lines crossed. Above the already built 35 years ago, Lindwurmtunnel, is the Goetheplatz station, which was also partially built before 1941, is reached. In this section of the tunnel, the wall bulges for the originally planned overhead pylons as well as the markings on the walls from its use as an air raid shelter during the Second World War are still recognizable. The following Poccistra√üe station (near the former suburban train station Munich South) was subsequently installed between the tunnels already in operation and opened on 28 May 1978, just under three years after the remainder of the line opened. At the Implerstra√üe station, the U3 and U6 lines separate again, here there is also, in the opposite direction, a single-track branch to the plant Theresienwiese, over which the route of the U4 / U5 is reached.  South (U3)  Machtlfinger Stra√üeF√ºrstenried West: Southern endpoint of the U3 Forstenrieder Allee From the three-track branching station Implerstra√üe, the U3 leads almost exactly to the south. The next station, Bruderm√ºhlstra√üe, was built together with the overlying Bruderm√ºhltunnel of the Middle Ring, which is why it lies relatively deep in the groundwater. An old millstone in the block level is a reminder of the tradition of the street. At the Thalkirchen (Tierpark) station, animal motifs, designed by Ricarda Dietz, on the tracks back walls give reference to the nearby Tierpark Hellabrunn. On the south side, a ramp leads from the underground station to the mezzanine level and continues towards the Isar and Zoo. Climbing the banks of the Isar, a little less than 30 vertical meters, the U3 reaches the columnless Obersendling station, a point of connection to the Siemenswerke S-Bahn station. Obersendling was the first station in which the planners of the subway unit left the bored pile walls open as a design element, painted in reddish brown. The following station, Aidenbachstra√üe, is characterized by twelve broken mirror surfaces, which are arranged according to the center pillars. Similar to Obersendling, the bored pile walls were painted burgundy red at the now following Machtlfinger Stra√üe station, and decorated with art objects from Rupprecht Geiger. A special feature of the not very low station is its two large skylights. The next station, Forstenrieder Allee, is similar to the one on Aidenbachstra√üe, but shows pictures by the artist Helmut Pfeuffer. On Basler Stra√üe, the cartoonist Ernst H√ºrlimann has immortalized himself in the form of a red devil, alluding to figures of the Basel Fasnacht. The elevator shaft also lets in a lot of daylight on the platform. At the end station, F√ºrstenried West, was the first use of a novel lighting concept, which distributes two-thirds of the light indirectly via large reflectors onto the platform.  South (U6)  Gro√ühadern Behind the Implerstra√üe underground station, the U6 line branches off to the west in a right turn. Before the station, the only operating section of the Munich subway branches off into the three-track operation Theresienwiese and further to the U-Bahn station Schwanthalerh√∂he the U4 / U5. At Harras, there is a connection to the S-Bahn S7 line and to the trains of the Bavarian Oberlandbahn (BOB). Some portions of the U6 end here. The following stops Partnachplatz, Westpark and Holzapfelkreuth, emerged as part of the IGA. Characteristic of these three stations are the color gradients on the walls. In the further course of the route, the end station at the Klinikum Gro√ühadern is reached via Haderner Stern and Grosshadern, whose access to the surface is visible in the form of two glass pyramids. The last three stations are the most elaborate of the U6. Walls, floors, ceilings and the lighting concept are precisely coordinated and artistically created.  Operation   U3  The U3 line of the Munich underground has 25 stations and is more than 20 km long. It runs from Moosach station, east to M√ºnchner Freiheit, from there south to Thalkirchen, then turns west and ends in F√ºrstenried West.  U6  The U6 line of the Munich underground has 26 stations and, at 27.4 km long, is the longest Munich subway line. It runs in a north-south-westerly direction from Garching-Forschungszentrum via Fr√∂ttmaning, M√ºnchner Freiheit, Odeonsplatz, Marienplatz, Sendlinger Tor, Implerstra√üe and Harras to the Klinikum Gro√ühadern. The U6 operates as the only line weekdays outside rush hours, and on Saturdays during the day in a quicker tackt between M√ºnchner Freiheit and Harras (every 3/7 minutes), in order to stay track with the U3, with a tackt timing of 3/3/4 minutes, in order to compensate the high number of passengers. Currently (summer 2016), the C2 series is being tested on weekdays from 7 am, between M√ºnchner Freiheit and Garching Forschungszentrum. This results in a 3/3/4-Minuten-Tackt between M√ºnchner Freiheit and Fr√∂ttmaning, and a 4/6-minute tackt between Fr√∂ttmaning and Garching Forschungszentrum.  U8  Since 15 December 2013, the U8 amplifier line runs on Saturdays from the Olympiazentrum via the Hauptbahnhof to Sendlinger Tor. From the Olympiazentrum to Scheidplatz, it runs parallel to the U3 and turns off at Scheidplatz onto the main line 2. Therefore, the already carried out for some time, Saturday rides between Olympiazentrum and Sendlinger Tor has its own line number. The line runs on a section of the U8 (now U2) already existing since 1980 to 1988, from Olympiazentrum via Sendlinger Tor to Neuperlach south.  Planning   U3 (north): Untermenzing  An extension of the U3 in the north, via Moosach and further to the, opened in 2005, S-Bahn station Untermenzing, was in the traffic development plan 2006 of the city of Munich as a \\"corridor for network supplementation\\". In the long term, an extension to the Munich-Pasing station could be realized.  U6 (north): district of Freising  Since the northern end of the U6, the Garching-Forschungszentrum station, is already located directly on the border to the district of Freising, an extension to the north, to the S-Bahn stops Neufahrn, Eching or even the airport was required (see Regional Plan Munich 2004). In a feasibility study commissioned by MVG itself, an extension of the U6 to Neufahrner S-Bahn station was investigated. While the study showed, as expected, that these plans did not replace a rapid transit or express train connection between Munich Hauptbahnhof and the airport, it concluded that the networking of the U6 and S1 would bring many benefits. In addition to cutting back travel times to the airport from the U6 station \\"Universit√§t\\", the accessibility of the Allianz Arena from the airport and from northern and eastern Bavaria and the connection between the Garching and Freising-Weihenstephan locations of the TU Munich would be emphasized. The extension of the U6 to S1 is currently (as of 2017), again the subject of investigations to improve public transportion in the district of Munich.  U6 (south): Martinsried  The extension of the U6 in the south to Martinsried was decided on 20 July 2009 by the district of Munich. The 67 million euro expensive, approximately 900 meters long route, was originally going to go into operation in 2014/2015. However, the financing negotiations proved difficult. The Bavarian Cabinet gave its approval for the project in December 2014. The timetable foresees the start of construction for the end of 2016 and the commissioning for the end of 2020.  Renovations and Repairs  Since the 40-year-old Heidemann Bridge between the stations Freimann and Kieferngarten (northeast of the U6) had to be completely renovated, the trains between the stations Studentenstadt and Kieferngarten 2013 and 2014 were interrupted for 3 months. During this time, first the west, then the east side of the bridge were renewed. The other track had to be available for the accessibility of construction vehicles.  Trivia  The line number comes from the tram line 6, which before the opening of the U6, served with a walkway from Freimann on Nordfriedhof, Odeonsplatz, Stachus, Sendlinger-Tor- Platz, Harras to Lorettoplatz, one of today's U6 similar operation area.

Kathiawar is a peninsula which today forms part of the Indian state of Gujarat.

These states comprised the \\"Kathiawar Agency\\". The rest of the peninsula, chiefly in the east along the Gulf of Cambay, were districts ruled directly by the British as part of British India's Bombay Presidency, which included part of the peninsula.

Saurashtra Railway later along with others became part of Western Railway of Indian Railways. Customs Union of British India The \\"Government of India Act\\" of 1858 brought India under the direct control of the British Crown. Kathiawar by its nature as a collection of individual autonomous States did not fall into the provision of the Act. The Gaikwar of Baroda had already handed their right to the area over to the British India as part of the settlement of 1807 which saw the Government in Bombay dealing with the political development of the peninsular. In 1882 Lord Lytton Wrote \\"The British Government now undertakes the duty to protect all Native States in India prom external enemies and preserving internal order by measures necessary for securing the people in misgovernment and for supporting the lawful Authority of the Ruler\\". The raising of taxes and tariffs was left to the individual States. Some states such Rajkot, Palitana and Bhavnagar instituted Legislative Assemblies although these were partly a cosmetic attempted to start a democratisation of the States. The right to levy taxes on the people and interstate was a privilege the princely families was not going to give up easily. The result was higher and higher tariff walls within the province. Some of the larger States like Gondal and Palitana did not charge duties, making the transit of goods via those states preferable. With the Maritime States, the tariffs were set to encourage Imports and exports from the interior to their respective ports. This only produced what only could be termed economic warfare and the over development of their ports the only thing it actually produced was bad feelings between the various states and an encouragement of imports over local development of the hinterland States. As these tariffs caused barriers in the development of the peninsular there was a call for a unification and removal of these barriers this idea was turned down by the Durbars at the time as late as the 1820s. The import of British Manufactured goods was the cause of the decline in the Indian craft industries. The States had no trading agreements with The East India Company nor the British Government but the development of the ports took trade away from the British Ports and Bombay, the exception was Bhavnagar which had been accorded the status of a British Port. The railways gave it a fast and vital link into parts of northern and Central India and with the subsidies it gave the import of goods a lucrative trade. In 1917 the Ports were admitted into the British Customs Union and further development of the Ports and links took place.\\"Kathiawar Economics\\" by A. B.

It is located within the Southwest Penang Island District, at the southern tip of Penang Island, making it the southernmost human settlement on the island. The village is hemmed in between the Penang International Airport to the north and the Malacca Strait to the south.  Etymology  The Malay word 'Permatang' refers to the village's geographic landform, as it is situated on a ridge surrounded by mangrove swamps. 'Damar' in Malay means resin whilst 'Laut' is the Malay word for the sea; the village was purportedly where resin-producing trees once grew along the shore, hence the phrase 'Damar Laut'.  History  According to historians in Universiti Sains Malaysia, the village of Permatang Damar Laut was founded in the late 18th century by three pioneers of Indonesian origin - Pah Kechil, Jamaluddin and Nakhoda Che Salleh. The village was one of the handful of autonomous Malay settlements that were established at the south of Penang Island at the time.  Transportation  The main road within Permatang Damar Laut is Jalan Permatang Damar Laut, which forms part of the Federal Route 6. The thoroughfare cuts through the village, linking it with Batu Maung to the east and the old town of Bayan Lepas to the west. Permatang Damar Laut is also the southern terminus of Rapid Penang's bus route 302, which connects the village with several destinations along the eastern half of Penang Island, such as Batu Maung, Bayan Lepas, Bayan Baru, SPICE Arena and the capital city of George Town.http://www.rapidpg.com.my/journey-planner/route- maps/details/302.gif To alleviate worsening traffic congestion in the area, the Malaysian Public Works Department has widened a stretch of the road leading to the village in 2017. The project also included the construction of a flyover and an elevated U-turn.  Education  Permatang Damar Laut is served by a single primary school - SRK Permatang Damar Laut.  Health care  The village contains a haemodialysis centre operated by the Penang Fo Yi Haemodialysis Society. Opened in 2017, the Fo Yi Medicare Centre is equipped with 30 dialysis machines, which allow it to treat 180 kidney patients per month.

Lady Anne Vaughan was a daughter of John Vaughan, 3rd Earl of Carbery, and his second wife Anne, who died following her birth.

It runs roughly north to south from Old Brompton Road to Fulham Road. History Drayton Gardens on an 1890s Ordnance Survey map Drayton Gardens was once a \\"rustic lane\\" in the hamlet of Brompton, lined with a mix of market gardens and country houses, until more suburban villas began to be built in the early 1800s. Later, some of the older houses were demolished, and mansion blocks appeared, including Drayton Court in 1902, and Onslow Court in 1935. The northern half (1-39 and 4-56) formed part of the Day Estate, and was a three-acre field known as Rosehall or Rose Hawe, which the Day family acquired by the marriage in 1743 of Benjamin Day, the son of a wealthy Norwich weaver, to Ann Dodemead, daughter and co-heir of Walter Dodemead of Covent Garden. Notable buildings and residents Rosalind Franklin, who discovered the structure of DNA, lived at number 107 (Donovan Court) until her death, and in 1992, English Heritage placed a commemorative blue plaque. The socialite Dorothy Fellowes-Gordon and her lifelong companion, the gossip columnist Elsa Maxwell lived there from 1912.\\"Inventing Elsa Maxwell: How an Irrepressible Nobody Conquered High Society\\", By Sam Staggs, St. Martin's Press, Oct 16, 2012 In 1926, Margery Blackie, homeopath to Queen Elizabeth II, established a practice there. In 1947, Bolton's Theatre Club opened in a building originally opened in 1911 as Bolton's Picture Playhouse. By operating as a club where membership was obligatory, the theatre was able to stage plays not passed by the censor, and many of its plays transferred to the West End. After closure and conversion the building was reopened in 1955 by James Quinn as the Paris Pullman Cinema which showed art-house films until its final closure and demolition in 1983. It was replaced by a block of flats. From 1960 until his death in 1968, the author and artist Mervyn Peake lived at no 1. Adelaide Hall, the jazz singer and entertainer lived at no 74, with her husband Bert Hicks. Sir William Arbuthnot Lane, 1st Baronet and Lady Frittie Arbuthnot Lane lived next door at no 72. St John Philby, the orientalist and explorer, lived in Grove Court in a flat belonging to his wife Dora. It was there that his son Kim Philby, the notorious NKVD/KGB agent, betrayed Erich Vermehren to the Russians after his defection from the German Abwehr to MI6 in 1944; and where ten years later he organised the well-known press conference at which he temporarily convinced the public that he was not the \\"Fourth Man\\".

In order to learn from the experience of developed nations, during March 24‚Äì25, 2009, an Indo-US Workshop on International Trends in Digital Preservation was organized by C-DAC, Pune with sponsorship from Indo-US Science & Technology Forum, which lead to more constructive developments towards formulation of the national program.  National Study Report on Digital Preservation Requirements of India  During April 2010, Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology, Government of India entrusted the responsibility of preparing National Study Report on Digital Preservation Requirements of India with Human-Centred Design & Computing Group, C-DAC, Pune, which was already active in the thematic area of heritage computing. The objective of this project was to present a comprehensive study of current situation in India versus the international trends of digital preservation along with the recommendations for undertaking the National Digital Preservation Program by involving all stakeholder organizations. Technical experts from around 24 organizations representing diverse domains such as e-governance, government and state archives, audio, video and film archives, cultural heritage repositories, health, science and education, insurance and banking, law, etc. were included in the national expert group. Major institutions represented in the expert group were Centre for Development of Advance Computing (C-DAC), National Informatics Centre (NIC), Unique Identity Program, National Archives of India, National Film Archive of India, Indira Gandhi National Centre for the Arts, Information and Broadcasting (Doordarshan and All India Radio), National Remote Sensing Center (NRSC) / ISRO, Controller of Certifying Authorities (CCA), National e-Governance Division (NeGD), Life Insurance Corporation, Reserve Bank of India (RBI), National Institute of Oceanography (NIO), Indian Institute of Public Administration, Defense Scientific Information & Documentation Centre (DSIDC) and several other organizations. The expert group members were asked to submit position papers highlighting the short term and long-term plans for digital preservation with respect to their domain. The study report was presented before Government of India in two volumes as under - * Volume ‚ÄìI Recommendations for National Digital Preservation Program of India * Volume-II Position Papers by the National Expert Group Members The report included an overview of international digital preservation projects, study of legal imperatives (Information Technology ACT 2000/2008), study of technical challenges and standards, consolidated recommendations given by the national expert group for the National Digital Preservation Program. One of the key recommendations given in this report was to harmonize Public Records Act, Right to Information Act, Indian Evidence Act, Copyright Act and other related Acts with the Information Technology Act in order to address the digital preservation needs. The foresight of this recommendation has proved right, as in 2018, the Indian judiciary has initiated the drafting of electronic evidence rules to be introduced under the Indian Evidence Act. In this context, the Joint Committee of High Court Judges visited C-DAC, Pune on 10 March 2018 to examine the technical aspects of the proposed electronic evidence rules in terms of extraction, encryption, preservation, retrieval and authentication of e-evidence in the court of law.  Centre of Excellence for Digital Preservation  As recommended in the national study report, during April 2011, Centre of Excellence for Digital Preservation was launched as the flagship project under the National Digital Preservation Program, funded by Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology, Government of India. The project was awarded to Human-Centred Design & Computing Group, C-DAC Pune, India. The objectives of Centre of Excellence were as under: * Conduct research and development in digital preservation to produce the required tools, technologies, guidelines and best practices. * Develop the pilot digital preservation repositories and provide help in nurturing the network of Trustworthy Digital Repositories (National Digital Preservation Infrastructure) as a long-term goal * Define the digital preservation standards by involving the experts from stakeholder organizations, consolidate and disseminate the digital preservation best practices generated through various projects under National Digital Preservation Program, being the nodal point for pan-India digital preservation initiatives. * Provide inputs to Ministry of Electronics & Information Technology in the formation of National Digital Preservation Policy * Spread awareness about the potential threats and risks due to digital obsolescence and the digital preservation best practices. The major outcomes of this project are briefly summarised hereafter.  Digital Preservation Standard and Guidelines  Digital preservation standard and guidelines are developed in order to help local data intensive projects in preparing for highly demanding standards such as ISO 16363 for Audit and Certification of Trusted Digital Repositories. The standard is duly notified by Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology, Government of India Vide Notification No. 1(2)/2010-EG-II dated December 13, 2013 for all e-governance applications in India. * e-Governance standard for Preservation Information Documentation (eGOV-PID) of Electronic Records The eGOV-PID provides standard metadata dictionary and schema for automatically capturing the preservation metadata in terms of cataloging information, enclosure information, provenance information, fixity information, representation information, digital signature information and access rights information immediately after an electronic record is produced by e-governance system. It helps in producing an acceptable Submission Information Package (SIP) for an Open Archival Information System (OAIS) ISO 14721:2012. * Best practices and guidelines for Production of Preservable e-Records Best practices and guidelines introduce 5 distinct steps of e-record management namely e-record creation, e-record capturing, e-record keeping, e-record transfer to trusted digital repository and e-record preservation which need to be adopted in all e-governance projects. It also specifies the open source and standard based file formats for the production of e-records. The guidelines incorporate the Electronic Records Management practice as per the ISO/TR 15489-1 and 2 Information and Documentation - Records Management.  Digital Preservation Tools and Solutions  However, it is difficult to implement the digital preservation standard due to unavailability required tools and solutions. Therefore, the standard and guidelines are supported with a variety of digital preservation tools and solutions which can be given to the memory institutions and records creating organizations for long term preservation. The project team at C-DAC Pune has developed a software framework for digital archiving named as DIGITƒÄLAYA (‡§°‡§ø‡§ú‡§ø‡§ü‡§æ‡§≤‡§Ø in Hindi language) which is customizable for various domains, data types and application contexts such as * E-records management & archival (a variety of born digital records produced by organizations on day-to-day basis) * Large volume of e-governance records * Audiovisual archives * Digital libraries / document archives DIGITƒÄLAYA (‡§°‡§ø‡§ú‡§ø‡§ü‡§æ‡§≤‡§Ø) is designed and developed as per the CCSDS Open Archival Information System (OAIS) Reference Model, ISO 14721: 2012. A number of digital preservation tools are developed to help in processing the digital data * e-SANGRAHAN (‡§à-‡§∏‡§Ç‡§ó‡•ç‡§∞‡§π‡§£): E-acquisition tool * e-RUPƒÄNTAR (‡§à-‡§∞‡•Ç‡§™‡§æ‡§Ç‡§§‡§∞): Pre-archival data processing tool * DATƒÄNTAR (‡§°‡•á‡§ü‡§æ‡§Ç‡§§‡§∞): E-records extraction tool * SUCHI SAMEKAN (‡§∏‡•Ç‡§ö‡•Ä ‡§∏‡§Æ‡•á‡§ï‡§®): Metadata importing and aggregation tool * META-PARIVARTAN (‡§Æ‡•á‡§ü‡§æ-‡§™‡§∞‡§ø‡§µ‡§∞‡•ç‡§§‡§®): Any to any metadata conversion tool * DATA HASTƒÄNTAR (‡§°‡•á‡§ü‡§æ-‡§π‡§∏‡•ç‡§§‡§æ‡§Ç‡§§‡§∞): Data encryption and transfer tool * PDF/A converter tool All the archival systems and digital preservation tools are developed in such a way that they enable in producing evidences / reports as required for the audit and certification of trustworthy digital repositories.  Pilot Digital Repositories  In order to test and demonstrate the effectiveness of digital preservation tools, various pilot digital repositories were developed in collaboration with domain institutions such as Indira Gandhi National Centre for Arts; New Delhi; National Archives of India, New Delhi; Stamps and registration Department, Hyderabad; and e-District. C-DAC Noida developed the pilot digital repository for e-Court in collaboration with district courts of Delhi using e-Goshwara: e-Court Solution. The pilot digital repositories were selected from different domains with following objectives: * Understand different data sets in terms of metadata, digital objects, file formats, authenticity, access control and requirements of designated users * Identify opportunities for development of tools and solutions in order to address domain specific requirements * Involve the stakeholders in digital preservation process * Generate proof of concept by deploying the solutions in the domain institutions  ISO 16363 Certified Trusted Digital Repository  As a part of the pilot digital repositories, National Cultural Audiovisual Archive (NCAA) at IGNCA, New Delhi is established using DIGITƒÄLAYA (‡§°‡§ø‡§ú‡§ø‡§ü‡§æ‡§≤‡§Ø). NCAA manages around 2 Petabytes of rare cultural audiovisual data. During June 2017, Primary Trustworthy Digital Repository Authorization Body (PTAB), UK got accredited by National Accreditation Board for Certification Bodies (NABCB), New Delhi, India. PTAB was involved to audit National Cultural Audiovisual Archive. Both NCAA and C-DAC teams worked together during the audit process. Finally, NCAA has been awarded the certified status as Trusted Digital Repository on 27 November 2017, as per ISO 16363. It happens to be the first Certified Trusted Digital Repository (Certificate No. PTAB-TDRMS 0001) as per ISO 16363 in India and world.  Capacity Building for Audit and Certification  The High Level 3-day Training Course on ISO 16363 for Auditors and Managers of Digital Repositories was conducted during 11‚Äì13 January 2017 at India Habitat Centre, New Delhi, India. This training was organized as per the deliverable of Centre of Excellence for Digital Preservation by C-DAC Pune in collaboration with Primary Trustworthy Digital Repository Authorization Body (PTAB), UK. This initiative was helpful in formally introducing the ISO 16363 and ISO 16919 through the National Accreditation Board for Certification Bodies (NABCB) for the audit and certification of Indian digital repositories. The first batch of potential technical auditors was trained which included 27 Participants from various stakeholder organisations. Apart from this, numerous digital preservation and DIGITƒÄLAYA (‡§°‡§ø‡§ú‡§ø‡§ü‡§æ‡§≤‡§Ø) training sessions were organised for the staff of NAI, IGNCA and the 21 partner institutions contributing in NCAA project.  Contribution to UNESCO Standard Setting Instrument on Preservation of Digital Heritage  The Principal Investigator of Centre of Excellence for Digital Preservation, Dr. Dinesh Katre represented India in the UNESCO International Experts Consultative Meet on Preservation and Access during June 25‚Äì26, 2014 at Warsaw, Poland, which drafted the Standard Setting Instrument for the protection and preservation of the digital heritage. General Conference of UNESCO at its 38th session on 1 and 2 July 2015 unanimously adopted the Recommendation Safeguarding the Memory of the World ‚ÄìPreservation of, Access to, Documentary Heritage in the Digital Era (38 C/Resolutions ‚Äì Annex V). Based on the experience gained from this project, Government of India is considering to create a national policy on digital preservation which will be instrumental in establishing national digital preservation infrastructure. The digital preservation initiative stands at the crux where it is crucial to fill up the gap between the Digital India and the challenges posed by rampant technological obsolescence, to make it a truly sustainable vision.

After breaking his neck in a rugby scrum at the University of Waterloo in 1981 he was rendered a quadriplegic. Subsequently, Shannon finished law school and became a disability rights activist. His Dave Shannon Cross-Canada Tour in 1997 gained national media attention as he became the first quadriplegic to trek across Canada in a motorized wheelchair. Shannon has held positions in academia, law, social services and human rights in both Thunder Bay, Ontario and Halifax, Nova Scotia. In the late 2000s, Shannon became the first quadriplegic to reach the North Pole and to parachute out of an airplane at an altitude of over 25,000 feet. Shannon has won numerous prestigious awards and honours, such as the Order of Ontario and the Order of Canada for his work advancing the rights of the disabled and other minority groups in Canada and abroad. Early Life, 1963-1981 David Shannon was born in Fort William, Ontario (now Thunder Bay) August 29, 1963, to William (Bill) and Lorraine Shannon. He spent the first eight years of his life in the city with his two sisters Janice and Liana. His father Bill decided to pursue a Ph.D. in health education; therefore, the family moved in the early 1970s to Greeley, Colorado. Once his father finished his doctorate, the family moved to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania where Bill accepted a position at Temple University.Daryl Rock, Making a Difference: Profiles in Abilities (Toronto: Canadian Abilities Foundation, 2001), 215-225 In 1975, Shannon‚Äôs family moved again, this time, to Dartmouth, Nova Scotia as Bill took on a faculty position with the School of Physical Education at Dalhousie University. Shannon was twelve at the time and enrolled in Ellenvale Junior High School where he became active in drama and sports. In the late 1970s, Shannon attended Prince Andrew High School where he continued to excel in drama and rugby. Prior to his last year of high school, Shannon‚Äôs parents moved to Mississauga, Ontario where his father, who had at the time become \\"disenchanted with academia\\", accepted a job with the city of Toronto Health Care Unit.Monty Charness, \\"Sports Heart or Hammer Comments,\\" The Reporter, October 10, 1981.

A month after the accident, the University of Waterloo Warriors and the University of Toronto Blues dedicated all the proceeds of an October 1981 rugby match to Shannon.Robert MacLeod, \\"Blues-Warriors game to aid injured player: Shannon vows to walk again,\\" Globe and Mail, October 23, 1981; \\"Look! In the Sky!\\" Toronto Sun, October 25, 1981. Shannon overcame some early difficulties during his recovery, such as losing 35 lbs, suffering from a severe bladder infection, and experiencing temperatures as high as 104 degrees F. However, he was able to visit his parents‚Äô home in Mississauga that Christmas which received local media attention.Hutchinson, \\"A Christmas Story‚Ä¶\\"; Jackie Smith, \\"Quadriplegics win tough fight over wish to die: 3 paralysis victims tell how time, grit, tears and laughter helped them adjust to drastically altered realities,\\" Toronto Star, March 08, 1982. After his rehabilitation at Lyndhurst, Shannon wanted to continue his education and moved to Thunder Bay in 1982 to pursue an undergraduate degree. Education and Early Activism in Thunder Bay, Ontario 1982-1984 In 1982, Shannon moved back to his hometown and entered Lakehead University majoring in English literature and minoring in law and politics.Craig, \\"Rugby mishap paralyzed him‚Ä¶\\". At the time, Thunder Bay was a leader in accessible housing and transportation and Shannon moved into an apartment in the fully accessible Castlegreen housing complex run by the Handicapped Action Group Incorporated (HAGI).Rock, Making a Difference, 215-225. While pursuing his undergraduate degree, he and friend Darlene Bruzzese (his future second wife) were influential in setting up a local chapter of the Spinal Cord Society, which was an international organization based in Fergus Falls, Minnesota.\\"Students help set up spinal cord group,\\" Chronicle Journal, August 30, 1984, 17. The organization was founded by Dr. Charles E. Carson in 1978 and focused on finding a cure for spinal cord injuries; indeed, its motto was \\"a cure not care\\".Gerry Poling, \\"Cure! Not Care! Motto of spinal cord society,\\" Chronicle Journal, September 28, 1983, 21. The Thunder Bay chapter was the 5th in Canada and 120th in North America with Shannon becoming the project coordinator. He obtained a federal grant, which allowed the chapter to engage in public events becoming the most active in Canada.\\"Students help set up‚Ä¶,\\" 17; Poling, \\"Cure! Not Care!..,\\" 21. Graduation from Lakehead and Move to Halifax, Nova Scotia 1986-1991 Midway through his undergraduate studies, Shannon relocated to another accessible apartment in Thunder Bay, Glenwood Court where HAGI provided attendant services. However, the polling station he was assigned to was wheelchair inaccessible (having a flight of stairs), which left him \\"denied the right to vote\\".Jo-Ann Mihalich, \\"Poll site barred elector,\\" Chronicle Journal, November 14, 1985, 1. The incident made headlines in Thunder Bay with Shannon petitioning the mayor, city council and the Ontario Human Rights Commission to make all polling stations completely accessible rather than relying on advanced polls or voting by proxy.Ibid. While in his last year at Lakehead, Shannon became the assistant regional co-ordinator of the Canadian Paraplegic Association where he organized peer interaction groups for those with spinal cord injuries.Bruce Langer, \\"Paraplegics find support from peers: Family, friends must adapt too,\\" Chronicle-Journal, July 15, 1987, 19. Shannon graduated from Lakehead University in the spring of 1986 and moved to Halifax, Nova Scotia to pursue a law degree in 1987 at Dalhousie University. At Dalhousie, Shannon developed a passion for human rights and constitutional law.Falk, Dan, \\"Unresolved questions: Foetus is a ‚Äòlegislative void,‚Äô\\" Chronicle Herald, 1990; Rob Mills, \\"Fetal tissue transplant laws sought,\\" Chronicle Herald, 1990. In his final year, he became student union president and graduated alongside future Canadian Foreign Affairs Minister Peter McKay.Rock, Making a Difference, 215-225. Acting Stint and Early Law Career 1991-1997 After graduating with a Bachelor of Law from Dalhousie in 1991, Shannon decided to take two years off to pursue his passion of acting in Los Angeles, California and Toronto, Ontario.Ibid. He moved to Los Angeles with some friends in early 1991 and took acting, advanced film, commercial, and television classes. Shannon also studied voice under Marjorie Taylor who is well known for her work with touring opera companies. It was during this time that Shannon created and performed his one-man stage play The Puck Dances Lovingly. The play was the story of a young man transitioning into adulthood. Shannon used a series of monologues and prose passages to explain this transition through imagining the young man alone on a hockey rink with the puck all to himself.Bob Hearn, \\"Courtroom Drama: A city man combines passions for acting and the law with a two-episode stint on TV‚Äôs Divorce Court,\\" Chronicle-Journal, September 23, 17. Dave Shannon, Program for The Puck Dances Lovingly: A one person play presented by Dave Shannon, Thunder Bay: Magnus Theatre, May 11‚Äì13, 1996, 1-12. In the early 1990s, Shannon scored a series of small roles in television commercials, but his big break came in 1992 with a recurring role as hard-hitting family lawyer Shawn O‚ÄôDonnell in the courtroom television drama Divorce Court.Hearn, \\"Courtroom drama‚Ä¶\\" 17. After Divorce Court, Shannon began work at the Kinnea-Aweya legal aid clinic; he was called to the Bar of the Law Society of Upper Canada in 1996.Ibid; Bernie Bennett, \\"Quadriplegic driven by those before him,\\" Evening Telegram, April 1, 1997. Shannon also started his L.L.M. at the London School of Economics in the fall of 1992 graduating in 1997. During this time, Shannon worked part-time as a lawyer and disability advocate in Thunder Bay while also planning a cross- Canada motorized wheelchair tour.Rock, Making a Difference, 215-225. The Dave Shannon Cross-Canada Tour, 1994-1998 At 34, Shannon became the first quadriplegic to travel across Canada in a motorized wheelchair to raise money in support of educational, entrepreneurial and research initiatives for the disabled.Bill Roebuck, \\"Raising awareness of the potential of the disabled: Dave Shannon‚Äôs cross-Canada journey by wheelchair promotes education and research for those with a disability,\\" Home Digest, Early Spring 1997, 42. The cross-country trip was first attempted in 1980 by Terry Fox; however, Fox was forced to stop in September 1980 near Thunder Bay as his cancer had worsened.\\"Man who lost leg begins long run,\\" Chronicle-Journal, April 14, 1980, 2; Jo-Anne Stead, \\"I‚Äôm not going to quit, Fox Pledges,\\" Chronicle- Journal, September 3, 1980, 1. After Fox, paraplegic Blair Howell and polio victim Dan Altan finished cross-Canada treks in manual wheelchairs in 1983; then Rick Hansen engaged in a world wheelchair tour from 1985-1987, but the journey had never been attempted by a quadriplegic in a motorized wheelchair.\\"Vancouver to Halifax: Wheelchair trip set,\\" Chronicle-Journal, April 14, 1982, 10; \\"The Canadian crossing,\\" Chronicle-Journal, June 12, 1982, 24; \\"World tour in wheelchair,\\" Chronicle-Journal, March 19, 1985, 19; \\"Hansen completes 40,000km journey,\\" Chronicle-Journal, May 23, 1987, 1. Shannon got the idea to journey across Canada because he felt very fortunate living in Thunder Bay, which he believed was a world-leader in accessibility for the disabled. This belief along with over a decade of disability activism made him realize not everyone had the same opportunities he had.Julie Langpeter, \\"Dave Shannon wheels home,\\" Thunder Bay Post, August 5, 1997, B8. Shannon began planning for his tour in the summer of 1994, obtaining corporate sponsorship from Scotia Bank, Human Resources Development Canada and Invacare to fund the trek.Howard Reid, \\"Wheelchair tour on track to set off across Canada,\\" Chronicle-Journal, January 21, 1997, B3; Dave Shannon Cross Canada Tour, \\"News Release\\", February 20, 1997; Rock, Making a Difference, 215-225.

Involvement with the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, 2005-2006 Because of Shannon‚Äôs extensive work with the disability rights movement in Canada, he was chosen in the summer of 2005 to help develop an international human rights treaty to protect the rights of the disabled. The treaty was eventually called the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) and Shannon partook in discussions at the United Nations‚Äô headquarters in New York to help craft it.Wilson, \\"Lawyer to create‚Ä¶\\", A4; Sarah Elizabeth Brown, \\"Lawyer takes know-how to UN: Shannon addressing independent living for people with disabilities,\\" Chronicle-Journal, August 17, 2006, A1.

The case went to the Supreme Court of Canada in 2007 where in a 5-4 verdict the court ruled that VIA needed to make the cars accessible.Council of Canadians with Disabilities v. VIA Rail Canada Inc., [2007] 1 S.C.R. 650, 2007 SCC 15. Six Degrees of Dignity, 2007 In April 2007, Shannon released his book Six Degrees of Dignity: Disability in the Age of Freedom. The book puts forth a new way of looking at society where both the able-bodied and disabled are treated with the same degree of dignity. Shannon‚Äôs Six Degrees of Dignity model identifies various social and attitudinal barriers present in Canadian society. To rectify these barriers, Shannon puts forth six factors that need to be embraced which include: dignity in public perception, dignity in the community, dignity in law, dignity in public policy, dignity of self, and dignity in future.\\"Defining Dignity,\\" Chronicle-Journal, April 1, 2007, A1, A9.

It was adopted as the national anthem of Afghanistan from 1992 to 1999 and from 2002 to 2006 During the late 1990s, the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan under the Taliban took control over most of Afghanistan from the UN-recognized government and ruled most of the country until late 2001. The Taliban outlawed music throughout the territory that they controlled, which consisted of most of the country. As such, most of Afghanistan practically was left without a national anthem during that time, until late 2001 when the Taliban was overthrown. The song was reintroduced by the new transitional government of Afghanistan in 2002; it remained such when the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan was established in 2004 and was used by the latter until 2006.

He is the author of two books: Making Master Guitars (1993) and The Art of Violin Making (1999), both of which are widely used by luthiers and cited.  Education  Born in Cape Town, South Africa on 31 December 1953, Courtnall is the third of four children. He was educated at St. Stithians College in Johannesburg (1959‚Äì68) and South Africa's first multi-racial high school, Woodmead School in Rivonia (1969‚Äì71). At the age of 18 he relocated to the United Kingdom, studying for A levels at Abbotsholme School in Derbyshire (1972‚Äì73), before attending the University of London Goldsmiths College for a BA (Hons) degree in Fine Art Sculpture. It was during this period that his interest in building stringed musical instruments arose and he adopted Courtnall as a professional name, being a reference to his grandfather who had taught him woodwork as a child.Interview with Courtnall Summerfield, 12 December 2017. A family background in education was responsible for his interest in teaching guitar making as well as making instruments himself; his mother, Sonia Machanick, was an educational psychologist who founded Japari School, a special school in Johannesburg and his father, Hillel Abbe Shapiro was Professor of Forensic Medicine at the University of South Africa.  Career  In 1994, Courtnall was asked by the Newark School of Violin Making in the United Kingdom to write the syllabus and set up a new course in Classical Guitar Making. After an initial intake of twelve students, the course rapidly expanded to become the leading vocational course in guitar making in the United Kingdom, now awarding a BA (Hons) Musical Instrument Craft qualification through the University of Hull. In 2008 he retired from Newark College in order to teach privately. Courtnall's work was initially focused on understanding and building instruments in the Spanish classical guitar tradition begun by Antonio de Torres during the 19th century and later perfected by Hermann Hauser, Daniel Friederich and Jose Romanillos. More recently however, he has worked closely with the guitarist Rob Johns, to develop a lattice-braced concert guitar, influenced by, but not quite in the same vein as the Australian luthier Greg Smallman.Lecture given by Courtnall Summerfield at Leicester MusicFest, 12 February 2018.  Publications  Courtnall's first book; Making Master Guitars, is a practical guide and historical summary of leading luthiers of the 19th and 20th centuries, enabling readers to make reasonably close replicas of their instruments. It includes detailed working drawings and plans of guitars by Antonio de Torres, Hermann Hauser, Robert Bouchet, Ignacio Fleta, Santos Hernandez, Hernandez and Aguado, Daniel Friederich and Jose Romanillos. In a review for Classical Guitar magazine, luthiers, Lipkin and Algranati, concluded that Courtnall had \\"combined the detailed work of the scholar with the practical insights of the craftsman.\\" The book has since been translated into French and Japanese. His second book, The Art of Violin Making, was co-written with the violin maker Chris Johnson and regarded by The Strad magazine as a \\"major contribution\\" to the violin-making bookshelf. It includes a foreword by Lord Yehudi Menuhin, who refers to the book as \\"Exhaustive in its detailed exposition of the process of construction, conceived as it is, by two disciples of a distinguished English achievement - the Newark School of Violin Making\\". The book follows a similar format to Making Master Guitars and is closely based on the violin making method taught at the Newark School. It has been translated into Chinese.

It was published in December 2017, in The New Yorker and went viral online. Synopsis The story follows the brief relationship of Margot, a twenty-year-old college student, and Robert, a thirty-four-year-old man who is a regular at the movie theater where Margot works. After an exchange at the concession stand, he asks for her number, and they carry on an extensive conversation through texts. Margot finds Robert witty and funny through text, but more awkward and evasive when she tries to see him in person. When Margot returns from visiting home for winter break, she and Robert go on a real date: they see a movie, go to a bar, and then return to Robert‚Äôs home and have a consensual but unsatisfying sexual encounter. Margot resolves to tell him she isn‚Äôt interested in continuing to see him, but is unsure of how to do it politely but firmly. She eventually does at the urging of her roommate. A month later, she sees Robert while out at a bar with her friends. That night, he texts her repeatedly, his messages at first complimentary but becoming more needy and belligerent, ending with calling her a sexist slur. Reception BBC describes the short story as \\"being shared widely online as social media users discuss how much it relates to modern day dating\\". The Washington Post describes it as unique among the content in The New Yorker, because it resonated with a younger audience commenting, \\"for one of the first times, something in the magazine seemed to capture the experience not of print-oriented, older intellectuals but of Millennials.\\" The story is the year's most downloaded fiction published in The New Yorker, and also one of the most read pieces overall of 2017. The Atlantic notes that \\"The depiction of uncomfortable romance in 'Cat Person' seems to resonate with countless women,\\" and describes it as a \\"literary adjunct to the latest #MeToo moment.\\" Personal reactions have been largely, but not entirely, along gender lines (roughly akin to those to Jane Austen), and for many readers, it captures what it is like to be a woman in her twenties in 2017, including \\"the desperate need to be considered polite and nice at all costs.\\" Following the story's success, Roupenian secured a seven figure deal with Scout Press for her debut book, and was the subject of a bidding war in the American market, with offers exceeding $1m. She received a $1.2 million advance for her 2019 book You Know You Want This, an anthology series which includes Cat Person.

In the , Wrights Creek had a population of 156 people. The origin of the suburb name is from the Wright brothers who brought cattle to Wrights Creek in the year 1878.  Geography  The locality is mostly low-lying flat land (approx 10 metres above sea level) with a small area of mountainous area in the south- west of the locality rising to an unnamed peak of 200 metres above sea level. The Trinity Inlet (aka Smith Creek) is the northern boundary of the locality while Wrights Creek (the watercourse from which the locality takes its name) and Mackey Creek form parts of the eastern and western boundaries of the locality. Warner Road is the southern boundary. The northert part of the locality is undeveloped wetlands and the mountainous region is also undeveloped. However, most of the locality is used for farming (predominantly sugarcane). The Bruce Highway and North Coast railway line pass through the south-western part of the locality; Kamma railway station services the local area. There is also a network of cane tramways to transport the harvested sugarcane to the Mulgrave Sugar Mill.  History  Wrights Creek is situated in the Yidinji traditional Aboriginal country. Wright's Creek Provisional School opened on 8 October 1894, becoming Wright's Creek State School on 1 January 1909. It closed in 1953.  Development  As part of the Wrights Creek development plan, a trade, enterprise, freight and industry zone has been proposed in the southern part of Wrights Creek nearby Gordonvale to diversify the economy of the Cairns region and to provide employment opportunities. The development plan utilises the location of the Bruce Highway and North Coast railway line transport corridors. Significant portions of land would be retained for the purpose of sugarcane farming in the area and environmental management purposes. The local council supported the state development area on the basis that existing private businesses in the region would not be impacted by competition. As part of the Bruce Highway Southern Access Corridor development project, the construction of an off-road cycling path and an upgrade of the Bruce Highway has been funded by the state and federal governments, with construction expected to be completed from 2021‚Äì2023.

He used the professional name William Oliver. He has sometimes been mistakenly referred to as 'William Oliver the Younger' or 'William Oliver II'. He was, however, not (as implied) related to the artist William Oliver (1804‚Äì1853).  Life and family  Oliver was born in Worcester in 1823, the son of the surgeon William Williams and his wife Jane (maiden name Oliver).London, England, Church of England Marriages and Banns, 1754‚Äì1932 for William Oliver Williams, Camden, St Pancras Parish Chapel, 30 December 1852England Births and Christenings 1538‚Äì1875.

Two of their sons, Oliver 'Rhys' Williams and Reginald Arthur Williams, also became established artists, with the professional names of Oliver Rhys and Reginald Arthur respectively. William Oliver died in Kensington on 16 April, 1901.England and Wales Civil Registration Death Index, 1837‚Äì1915, volume 1a, page 113, 1901His obituary notice appeared in the Evening Standard the following dayIt was stated as follows. 'OLIVER WILLIAMS, on the 16th inst., 41 Queensgate Gardens, South Kensington, William Oliver Williams ('William Oliver', artist) aged 77'.  Career  Oliver was enrolled (as William Oliver Williams) as a Probationer at the Royal Academy Schools of the Royal Academy of Arts on 18 July 1848 (recommended by Thomas Clark (sic) from Birmingham) and as a student on 16 December 1848. The Schools' register, and other sources, indicate that he also worked at the Government School of Design, Birmingham (see Birmingham School of Art), where he was the assistant master (1849‚Äì1851) and the headmaster was Thomas Clarke (1846‚Äì1851). Whilst a student at the Royal Academy, he won 1st prize for his drawing from the antique in 1851 in the annual Premiums. During the early part of Oliver's career he added his surname when signing his works. This was seen with his two works exhibited at the British Institution in 1851 and 1852. He also used the name William Oliver Williams when he exhibited six paintings between 1858 and 1863 at the Royal Academy of Arts. In 1858 the first of two paintings was titled Portrait of a gentleman while the second was Rev. B.H. Kennedy, President of the School of Art, Shrewsbury. At this time Oliver had a Shrewsbury address, possibly suggesting that he worked at the local school of art. The final painting in 1863 was titled Crossing the ford. In the early 1850s, Oliver received a commission from the Arundel Society to tour Northern Italy and make drawings and watercolours of the classical masterpieces in the churches and galleries. His full name was first mentioned (as 'a young artist from the Royal Academy Schools') in the Society's fourth annual report in 1853. His task was to make drawings of Giotto's fresco in the Arena Chapel in Padua (see Scrovegni Chapel). Engravings were then made from these drawings. He therefore played a key role in producing one of the Arundel Society's most important early publications.Copies of the book of the engravings are in both the collections of the Royal Academy and the Royal Collection Trust Giotto‚Äôs Virtues. Temperance, Justice and Faith from the Arena Chapel, Padua. Watercolours by William Oliver Williams (1823‚Äì1901).Sixteen watercolours which Oliver is thought to have painted for the Arundel Society are recorded to have survived. In 1978, they were held in the Fine Art Department of the University of Leeds. More recently, three examples of these chiaroscuro watercolours have been reported to be held by the Victoria and Albert MuseumOliver also painted a number of additional watercolours derived from the Padua frescos, which he sold and which were owned privately in 1978. They have been described as 'highly finished and beautifully executed' and Oliver was described as 'a careful draughtsman and skilful water-colourist'. His watercolours were displayed by the Arundel Society at the Crystal Palace, Sydenham in 1855‚Äì6, and were praised by Dante Gabriel Rossetti. The fortune teller. Oil on canvas. Signed W. Oliver and dated 1886. Afer recovering from bankruptcy in 1863, by the late 1860s he was based in London and had adopted his more well-known professional name which he used thereafter. He continued to exhibit at the Royal Academy of Arts and British Institution (Tryste) in 1867, and at the Society of British Artists (The First Letter) in 1868. Subsequently, he also exhibited at the Walker Art Gallery Liverpool, Manchester Art Gallery, Royal Birmingham Society of Artists and Royal Glasgow Institute of the Fine Arts. His favoured exhibition venue was the Royal Academy of Arts. He exhibited 15 more works there starting with A thing of beauty is a joy for ever and Forget me not in 1867, and finishing with Mrs Oliver Williams in 1897. It is recorded that at least one of his paintings had sold in one of the major auction galleries for more than ¬£100 during the 1970‚Äì1975 period. His works mainly depicted figures of young women and pretty girls, or an attractive woman sometimes in Greek or Roman costume. Oliver's paintings were popular at the time and prints were made in response to demand. This popularity is reflected in the fact that 21 of his paintings are exhibited in public museums and galleries throughout the United Kingdom, as seen on the Art UK web site. The Art UK web site also lists two of Oliver's paintings separately as by William Oliver Williams. There is one of Oliver's oil paintings in the Royal Collection. It is titled Jack's Letter and is signed and dated 1881. It was presented by Mr and Mrs E. Johnson as a wedding present to the Duke and Duchess of York, 6 July 1893. Oliver's paintings are still available from dealers and at auctions. Examples of high recent auction prices for his paintings are ¬£4,320 for The letter at Bonhams on 21 June 2011 and ¬£5000 for Reclining Beauty at Christie's on 11 March 2015.

The canal itself is in length, and with its approaches has a total length of about . It has a depth of , a bottom width of , a width at water level of , and a navigation clearance of above water level. History Originally the two halves of Musk√∂ were separated by a natural sound, but post-glacial rebound had rendered this route unusable by the early 1700s. The first artificial canal was constructed in 1719 by the Russians as part of their campaign of raids at that time. Over time and with the land continuing to rise, the first canal became less usable and eventually, by the start of the 20th century, it had disappeared. In the 1930s the local fishermen proposed that the canal be re-excavated, as it would save them an hours voyage between their fishing grounds and market. In 1933 work commenced on re-opening the channel, as a public works project giving 52 unemployed men a paid job, and the canal opened in 1934. As built, a hand-operated bascule bridge was provided to carry the road between the two halves of the island, but this proved difficult to operated and was fixed in position. In the 1970s, a modern bridge was built north of the old bridge, which was left in place for pedestrian and bicycle traffic.

Background In the latter nineteenthHalsey, L. (December 1870). The College Widow, Phrenological Journal and Packard's Monthly, pp. 427-28 and early twentieth centuries, the trope of a \\"college widow\\" was spoken of on college campuses, usually meaning an attractive unmarried woman near campus who would date college students, moving on to new students as the years passed.Clark, Daniel A. Creating the College Man: American Mass Magazines and Middle-Class Manhood, 1890-1915, pp. 107, 227 (2010) Playwright George Ade first used the trope for a poem he wrote in 1900 (later published in the Saturday Evening Post in 1905), and as the inspiration for a play in 1904. American football also drives the light plot of the play, loosely based on the football rivalry between DePauw University and Wabash College, which is now known as the Monon Bell rivalry.(24 January 2006).

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1996. It serves as the headquarters of the Connecticut State Militia. Description and history The Connecticut State Arsenal and Armory is a large building located on the west side of the state capitol complex west of downtown Hartford. It is located just south of Interstate 84 and west of the Legislative Office Building, on the east side of Broad Street. The building functionally has two sections: a three-story \\"head house\\", in which offices and other facilities are located, and a large drill hall with a gabled roof. It is built mainly out of rough-cut granite blocks in an eclectic Classical Revival styling. Windows are generally narrow, and set in separate openings grouped up to three in a row. Limestone stringcourses top the first and third floors on the headhouse, where pilasters articulate the corners. The main entrance is set in the center of a broad projecting section of the headhouse, in a round-arch opening. The interior of the drill hall is in size, with a ramp from Broad Street providing ready access for the movement of heavy equipment. Its roof is constructed out of prefabricated concrete panels supported by steel trusses. The basement level houses weapons storage areas and formerly housed a firing range. The stated began considering construction of a major new armory facility in the early 20th century. After a drawn-out decision-making and land acquisition process, the present building was dedicated in 1909. Its design was by Benjamin Wistar Morris III, who had worked as draftsman at Carrere & Hastings before opening his own office in New York City in 1900. At the time of this building's development, John M. Carrere was a consultant to the city, and recommended its placement in the legislative area as part of a City Beautiful design plan. The building's trim was originally cast cement, with the molds and forming taking place on site. This trim was replaced with limestone during a major rehabilitation in the 1990s.

Zayed Sports City Stadium hosted the 1996 Asian Cup Final and is planned to host several matches in the 2019 AFC Asian Cup. It is also featured on the 200 Dirham banknote. The 43,000-seat stadium opened in 1980 and also hosted matches in the 2003 FIFA U-20 World Cup and the 2013 FIFA U-17 World Cup. Background Real Madrid qualified for the Club World Cup as winners of the 2017‚Äì18 UEFA Champions League by defeating Liverpool in the final. The club won three of the four previous editions of the Club World Cup: in 2014, 2016 and 2017. This was their fifth participation and third consecutive appearance in the tournament, both a record for European teams. The match was their fourth overall final (after 2014, 2016 and 2017), tying the record with Barcelona. The match also was their third consecutive final, extending their record set in the previous edition. The match was the 14th consecutive and overall final featuring a European team (with only the first final in 2000 including no team from Europe), and the 8th overall and 5th consecutive final featuring a Spanish team, all extending the competition records. If Real Madrid were to win, they would become the outright record winners of the Club World Cup with four titles, breaking their tie with Barcelona for the record. A win would also extended the records for most consecutive titles for a team (3), most titles for a confederation (11 for UEFA), most consecutive titles for a confederation (6 for UEFA, breaking the tie set by European teams between 2007 and 2011), most titles for a nation (7 for Spain), and most consecutive titles for a nation (5 for Spain). Al-Ain qualified for their first Club World Cup as winners of the 2017‚Äì18 season of the UAE Pro-League, the top-level league in the United Arab Emirates. Al-Ain was the first Emirati team to reach the Club World Cup final, as well as the second Asian team (after Kashima Antlers in 2016). The final was also the third final to feature the host representative (after Corinthians in 2000, Raja Casablanca in 2013 and Kashima Antlers in 2016). If Al-Ain were to win, they would have become the first team outside of Europe and South America to win the Club World Cup, as well as the second host representative to win the tournament (after Corinthians in 2000). The final was the second between an Asian and European team, after Real Madrid won against Kashima Antlers in the 2016 final. The final was also the third final between the host representative and a European team, both won by the European team, with Bayern Munich winning against Raja Casablanca in 2013, in addition to the aforementioned 2016 final. The match was the fourth final not to feature a South American team after 2010, 2013 and 2016 (all of which the European teams won).

Kashima, who had defeated CONCACAF champions Guadalajara, were defeated by Real Madrid in the 2016 final. Madrid defeated the Antlers 3‚Äì1 on a hat-trick scored by Gareth Bale over 11 minutes of play. Bale scored in the 44th minute and added two goals in the 53rd and 55th minutes to open the second half; Shoma Doi scored a consolation goal for Kashima in the 78th minute after it was ruled onside by the video assistant referee. Al-Ain In the first round on 12 December, Al-Ain defeated Team Wellington in a penalty shoot-out following a 3‚Äì3 draw at their home stadium, Hazza bin Zayed Stadium. Wellington, a semi-professional club that qualified as the OFC Champions League champion, entered halftime with a 3‚Äì1 lead that was cut back by an equalising volley from Marcus Berg. The match remained scoreless after extra time and advanced to a penalty shoot-out, which Al-Ain won 4‚Äì3 after five rounds after goalkeeper Khalid Eisa made two saves. Al-Ain advanced to face African champions Esp√©rance de Tunis in the second round match, held three days later at Hazza bin Zayed Stadium. The team defeated Esp√©rance 3‚Äì0 in an upset that began with two goals scored in the opening 16 minutes. Al-Ain produced a larger upset in the semi-finals, defeating Copa Libertadores champions River Plate in a penalty shoot-out to advance to the Club World Cup final. The match began with two early goals for River Plate scored by Rafael Santos Borr√© following an opening strike from Berg; after an equalising goal was disallowed by the video assistant referee, Caio Lucas Fernandes scored for Al-Ain in the 51st minute to draw the teams level at 2‚Äì2. After a scoreless extra time, aided by goalkeeper Essa's saves, Al-Ain defeated River Plate 5‚Äì4 in a penalty shoot-out, its second of the competition, with Essa making one save on River's Enzo P√©rez. The semi-final upset of River was called the \\"greatest achievement\\" in Emirati football history by Al-Ain manager Zoran Mamiƒá. Match Summary Real Madrid had 70 percent of possession in the first half, taking advantage of Al-Ain's defensive lapses to produce 11 shots. After a saved chance from Al-Ain's Hussein El Shahat, Luka Modriƒá opened scoring for Madrid in the 14th minute with a left-footed shot. Caio attempted to equalize a minute later, but was found to be offside. The half ended with a 1‚Äì0 lead for Madrid, with several later shots saved by Al-Ain goalkeeper Khalid Eisa. Madrid opened the second half with another series of attacks while retaining possession of the ball, finding its second goal in the 60th minute on a long-distance strike by Marcos Llorente. The pace of the match slowed as Al-Ain looked to find a consolation goal, with Caio taking advantage of a defensive mistake by Sergio Ramos but unable to score against goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois. Ramos responded by scoring in the 79th minute, a header on a corner kick taken by Modriƒá after a counter-attack, to give Real Madrid a three-goal lead. Six minutes later, a free kick taken by Caio found left-back Tsukasa Shiotani, who scored Al-Ain's only goal of the match. In stoppage time, an own goal was scored by Al-Ain's Yahia Nader on a cross by Madrid substitute Vin√≠cius J√∫nior; it was Madrid's final goal to extend their lead to 4‚Äì1.

GUAM countries were bound by a desire to prevent Russian expansionism in the region. Azerbaijan has a strategic role in the Organization for Democracy and Economic Development. Expanding the links with international organizations and individual countries is in the interest of Azerbaijan.  History  First, cooperation of Azerbaijan, Georgia, Ukraine and Moldova started in 1996 in Vienna, Austria, where four states proposed common goals and initiatives. During the Summit of Council of Europe in 1997, the Presidents of these states and stated their interests in developing regional cooperation. On 24 April in 1999, GUAM was expanded by one more member state ‚Äì Uzbekistan and was renamed to GUUAM. September 11 terrorist attack contributed to Uzbekistan's decision to cease its membership in GUAM. In 2006, name was changed to The Organization for Democracy and Economic Development.  Heydar Aliyev and GUAM  Heydar Aliyev took part in Washington Summit in 1999 and Yalta Summits in 2001 and 2002 of GUAM. According to him, the organization is based on geographical principles and most of all on cooperation through Transcaucasian highway and serves economic goals of its member states. On 4 May 2011 Heydar Aliyev met the leaders of chambers of comers of GUUAM member states and other countries. In September 2011, Baku hosted first women's forum for cooperation of member states of GUUAM. Heydar Aliyev met the participants and wished them success in their work.  Chairmanship of Azerbaijan in GUAM  The chairmanship of Azerbaijan in GUAM commenced on July 19, 2007, at Baku summit and lasted till Batumi Summit on 1 July 2008. Baku summit was held under the motto ‚ÄúGUAM: Bringing Continents together‚Äù. The importance of the long-term development and advantages of cooperation with partner countries was reflected in The Programme of the Republic of Azerbaijan and the program served as a basis for activities of organization in 2007‚Äì2008.  Ilham Aliyev and GUAM  The Chairman of GUAM summit in Batumi Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev made a speech: ‚ÄúNoting the development of cooperation within GUAM, President Ilham Aliyev said that GUAM has developing links with international organizations. Azerbaijan is currently standing in the way of intensive economic development, has become a global energy and transport corridor and contributes to the development of regional cooperation in various sectors of the economy‚Äù.  Differences of Azerbaijan and other GUAM countries  All GUAM countries are dependent on imports of oil and gas from Russia. Meanwhile, Azerbaijan has oil and gas reserves, the exports of which go through Russia. Azerbaijan has oil pipelines in its territory that need to be protected by military, however Moldova and Ukraine do not share such interest.  High level meeting  High- Level Meeting was held in 2017On March 27, prime-ministers of Ukraine, Georgia and Moldova and the deputy prime minister of Azerbaijan held a meeting in Kyiv. In comparison, with its first meeting in 2008, the group moved away from anti-Russia strategy and discussed economic issues such as regional trade agreement and transportation corridor. During the meeting, Azerbaijan called GUAM to increase its attention to trade and transportation. The representative of Azerbaijan pointed out that the work of transport corridor has accelerated in both bilateral and multilateral formats. Azerbaijan also has interest in revitalizing GUAM as an organization for economic cooperation and as a platform for resolving conflicts that exist in the GUAM area. ‚ÄúFirst and foremost, it is necessary to combine efforts to resolve existing conflicts in the GUAM area,‚Äù Altay Efendiyev, GUAM's secretary general and an Azerbaijani diplomat, said in December. Azerbaijan also called GUAM to increase its attention to trade and transportation.

Buffalo is Professor of Physiology and Biophysics at the University of Washington School of Medicine and Chief of the Neuroscience Division at the Washington National Primate Research Center. She is known for her research in the field of neurophysiology pertaining to the role of the hippocampus and medial temporal lobe structures in learning and memory and in spatial representation and navigation. Buffalo received the Troland Research Award from the National Academy of Sciences in 2011 for \\"innovative, multidisciplinary study of the hippocampus and the neural basis of memory.‚Äù She is a member of the Scientific Advisory Board of Caesar, a neuroscience research institute associated with the Max Planck Society, and the Dana Alliance for Brain Initiatives.  Biography  Buffalo attended Wellesley College where she received her bachelor's degree in philosophy in 1992. She completed a research internship in at the National Center for Toxicological Research, Jefferson, AR where she studies the effects of caffeine and other chemical agents (MK-801) on operant learning in monkeys. Buffalo continued her education at the University of California, San Diego, where she obtained her master's degree in philosophy in 1995, working under the supervision of Patricia Churchland, and her doctorate in neuroscience in 1998, working under the supervision of Stuart Zola and Larry Squire. Buffalo completed postdoctoral training in neuropsychology at the National Institute of Mental Health, where she worked with Robert Desimone from 1999-2005. Buffalo joined the faculty of the Department of Neurology at the Emory University School of Medicine in 2005 and was appointed to the core faculty of the Division of Neuropharmacology and Neurologic Diseases at the Yerkes National Primate Research Center in 2009. Buffalo moved to the University of Washington School of Medicine in 2013 with a joint appointment to the Division of Neuroscience of the Washington National Primate Research Center. Her research has been supported by grants from the National Institutes of Health, DARPA, the Simons Foundation, the Charles A. Dana Foundation, and Pfizer.  Research  Buffalo uses a variety of research methods to explore the neural basis of learning and memory, including the innovative use of video games to study the process of memory formation in monkeys. One of her goals has been to elucidate the role of the hippocampus in the development of cognitive maps and other forms of spatial representation and its role in episodic and declarative memory. Her collaborative work with other neuroscientists indicates that the hippocampus encodes a broad range of contextual cues, including temporal and situational information, to support memory for events as well as navigation skills. Some of Buffalo and her colleagues' work used lesion techniques with monkeys to better understand the role of the hippocampus in recognition and declarative memory. Monkeys subjected to lesions caused by ischemic damage, stereotaxic radio-frequency waves, or selective neurotoxins, like ibotenic acid, that took place at the hippocampus demonstrated impairments of recognition memory, as assessed using the visual paired-comparison task and the delayed non-matching to sample task. The authors concluded that the hippocampus play an essential role in recognition memory, with further work addressing how the hippocampus coordinates its function with other structures, especially the perirhinal cortex. Other work on memory function aims is to identify how changes associated with aging or disease can interfere with memory encoding and retrieval, and how visual processing might provide clues to understanding early cognitive impairment.

In 2009, the Unger-Frieze Prize was established by the Association for Women in Psychology to honor the legacy of Rhoda Unger and Irene Hanson Frieze \\"for their early leadership in feminist research.\\" This prize is awarded at the annual meeting of the Association for Women in Psychology to the best student- authored poster reporting research relevant to the field of feminist psychology.  Biography  Frieze received her Bachelor of Arts degree in Psychology and Mathematics from the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) in 1967. She continued her education at UCLA, obtaining her master's degree in 1968, and her Doctorate degree in Personality Psychology in 1973. Frieze joined faculty of the University of Pittsburgh in 1972 with a dual position in the department of Psychology and Women's Studies. She retired in 2016. Frieze served terms as President of the Society for the Psychology of Women (APA Division 35), Society for Psychological Study of Social Issues (APA Division 9), and the Society for General Psychology (APA Division 1). She served as the Chair of the International Committee for Women (APA Division 52), and as Editor of Sex Roles, and the Journal of Social Issues.  Research  Irene Hanson Frieze is known for her feminist voice in psychology as an early advocate for scholarship on the women's studies. Her co-authored textbook Women and Sex Roles: A Social Psychological Perspective, published in 1978, underscored the importance of including the study of women in the undergraduate psychology curriculum. Frieze conducted ground-breaking research on dating routines, violence and love in close relationships, and reactions to victimization. Her paper Investigating the Causes and Consequences of Marital Rape aimed to clear misconceptions about marital rape by establishing that it is possible for married couples who are having consensual sex to also experience marital rape between husband and wife. Her book Hurting the One You Love offered a synthesis of an extensive program of research on intimate partner violence and its impact on others close to the victim. The theme of violence against women was further explored in the volume Stalking: Perspectives on Victims and Perpetrators, which Frieze co-edited with Keith E. Davis and Roland D. Maiuro. One of Frieze's main interests concerned gender differences in the workforce and in attitudes about work and gender roles. In Assessing the Theoretical Models for Sex Differences in Causal Attributions for Success and Failure, Frieze and her colleagues determined through meta- analysis that men were less likely than women to attribute their successes or failures to luck. In another co-authored paper, Attractiveness and Income for Men and Women in Management, Frieze and her colleagues examined the effect of attractiveness on employment outcomes of men and women. The authors reported that men who were rated as more attractive were more likely to get hired, have higher starting salaries, and receive raises. The results were less clear for women: there was no effect of attractiveness for starting salaries, but attractive women were likely to have higher earnings later on in their careers.

Biography  Hyde received her BA in mathematics from Oberlin College in 1969. She continued her education at the University of California, Berkeley, where she completed her Ph.D in psychology in 1972. She received an honorary doctorate degree in social science from Denison University in 1996. Prior to joining the faculty of the University of Wisconsin-Madison in 1986, Hyde was a member of the faculty in the Department of Psychology at Bowling Green State University (1972-1979) and Denison University (1979-1986). Published in 2005, The Gender Similarities Hypothesis is a focal point of Hyde's work in the field. In this influential study, Hyde conducted a series of meta-analyses that documented how similar males and females are on most psychological variables, which contrasted with how different they are often perceived to be. The royalties from her co- authored textbook Half the Human Experience go to the Janet Hyde Graduate Student Research Grants to support doctoral psychology students in feminist research. Hyde is also co-author of the textbook Understanding Human Sexuality. Hyde received the Ernest R. Hilgard Lifetime Achievement Award presented by the American Psychological Association (APA) in 2016 and the James McKeen Cattell Fellow Award from the Association for Psychological Science in 2018. Previous awards include the Kinsey Award from the Society for the Scientific Study of Sexuality (1992), the Heritage Award from APA Division 35, Psychology of Women (1996), the Carolyn Wood Sherif Award from APA Division 35 (1998) for Men are From Earth, Women are From Earth.

Built in 1833 across the Park River, it was the largest stone bridge in the United States at its completion. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1985. Description and history The Stone Bridge is located just north of downtown Hartford, serving as the main span carrying Main Street across Whitehead Highway, a limited access connector between Interstate 91 and the capitol district. The highway is built atop a conduit that carries the Park River to the nearby Connecticut River. It now appears as a segmented arch, although it was originally built as a rounded arch over the then- unchanneled river. The bridge has a span of and has a width of . It is built out of cut brownstone, with stone parapets lining the roadway. The parapets were originally topped by wrought iron railings, one of which was removed when the adjacent Hartford Public Library was built over the highway just east of the bridge. A bridge has stood at this location since at least the 17th century. Bridges before this one were built of wood. The present bridge was built in 1833 at a cost of $30,000 by Elias Rathbun, a local contractor. The bridge was built at a higher elevation over the river (about above the riverbed), necessitating the raising of the grade on the approaches. It became a local landmark, featured in period depictions of the city. In 1955 the river was enclosed and the highway built above it, and in 1955-57 the library was built on the adjacent plaza.

History Indigo began the project after picking up the accordion, only to hear many comments on her instrument choice. The tongue-in-cheek name reflects the general quirky, exploratory spirit of Indigo's work, which mixes contemporary styles like trap with classic electronic sounds and acoustic instruments. The resulting music \\"finds a middle ground between hip-hop, electronica and classical from an artistic standpoint.\\" The Shepherd Express' Randy Otto, reviewing her 2015 double EP, called the resulting mix, \\"a soundscape that would appeal most to EDM fans.\\" After learning to make beats as a young woman in the UK, Indigo experimented with mixing live and electronic performance. She eventually moved back to California and became an arts and environmental educator at the Oak Grove School in Ojai, California founded by Krishnamurti, continuing to make music in her spare time. A move to the Bay Area meant a new focus on creating art. As noaccordion, Indigo has performed at many venues and music festivals around her home regions. She has released two LPs and 5 EPs internationally, as well as video collaborations with the Sustainable Living Road Show, a puppet collective and the Supernatural Factory, a video projection mapping studio. Her latest album, Gurukula, explores the sounds she collected on a trip to India, adding trap and other electronic styles.

Kramer began by studying singing and music in Sydney in the 1930s, but after attending a performance of the Bodenwieser Ballet in 1940, immediately decided on a career change to dance. After joining the troupe that had made such an impression on her, she toured around Australia and overseas for the next decade. She then lived and worked in France and the US for the next 60 years, before returning to Australia where she remains active in the arts . Early life Eileen Kramer was born and grew up in Mosman Bay with one other sibling, a brother. Her father, a car salesman, began showing signs of alcoholism when Kramer was about 10, leading to her mother leaving and secretly relocating with the children to Coogee when she was 13. Her mother then began working as a store detective at Farmers (now owned by Myer), a department store on George Street. Bodenwieser Ballet in Centennial Park, Sydney, ca. 1939 In 1936, when her mother remarried, Kramer left home and lived in a shared cottage on Philip Street until 1940 and studied singing at the Sydney Conservatorium of Music. To support herself, she worked as an usherette and an artist's model, at one time posing for Norman Lindsay. In 1940, her mother took her to a charity concert which included The Blue Danube, performed by Gertrud Bodenwieser's dance company. The next day, Kramer sought out Bodenwieser, and after successfully auditioning and completing three years of training, she joined Bodenwieser‚Äôs main troupe and began her career in professional dance. Career Kramer toured Australia with the Bodenwieser Ballet for the next 10 years. The group also toured internationally post-war to France, New Zealand, South Africa, and India. After leaving the troupe in 1953, she travelled to India, then lived and worked in Paris as an artist's model, often for Andre Lhote and his studio. It was here in 1957, aged 42, that she met an Israeli-American film-maker named Baruch Shadmi. The two collaborated on a mixed animated and live-action film for which she hand-made over 400 figures. At a casino in Dieppe, while Shadmi played roulette, she met Louis Armstrong and he taught her to do The Twist. While working on their film in the mid-1960s, Shadmi suffered a stroke, and Kramer effectively put her dance career on hold for 18 years while caring for him in New York. He died in 1987. In 1988, Kramer resumed her career and moved to Hinton to live with an old stage friend, before moving to Lewisburg in 1992. It was there she began a 20-year relationship with a ‚Äúrich Southern widower‚Äú named Bill Tuckwiller. In 2008, she self-published her first book, Walkabout Dancer, an account of her life. In September 2013, after Tuckwiller's death, Kramer returned to Australia at the age of 99 because she missed the kookaburras and the smell of gum trees. In 2014, to mark turning 100, she crowdfunded, choreographed, and performed a dance piece called \\"The Early Ones\\". In 2015, she was nominated as one of the 100 Women of Influence Awards by The Australian Financial Review and Westpac. In 2017, she created a dance-drama A Buddha's Wife, inspired by her travels in India, part of a wider work celebrating her life, and supported by the Arts Health Institute. A portrait, The inner stillness of Eileen Kramer by plastic surgeon Andrew Lloyd Greensmith, was a finalist for the Archibald Prize in 2017. Includes image of the portrait In 2017, a portrait of her by filmmaker Sue Healey was a finalist in the Digital Portrait Prize (National Portrait Gallery, Canberra) and a finalist in the Blake Prize (Casula Powerhouse Sydney) in 2018. Healey was also awarded the Australian Dance Award for Outstanding Achievement in Film or New media. Her co-written memoir, Eileen: Stories from the Phillip Street Courtyard, was published in November 2018. In December 2018, she was a guest on ABC's One Plus One programme. In 2019, she entered a self-portrait for the Archibald Prize, becoming the award's oldest ever contributor. Personal life Kramer never married nor had any children. Her first relationship was with Richard Want, her psychoanalyst, in 1936. She also had a romance with a French diplomat while in India. Kramer later had two extended relationships while living abroad, with Baruch Shadmi (1920 - 1987) and William \\"Bill\\" D. Tuckwiller.

It took place at the Est√°dio Algarve in Faro/Loul√©, Portugal with 350 fans in attendance. The Gibraltar Football Association chose to play at the Est√°dio Algarve as this would be the stadium the team would use for competitive matches as their only venue the Victoria Stadium was not eligible to. The game ended in a 0‚Äì0 draw which was seen as an upset with Slovakia being heavy favourites to defeat UEFA's newest members. Gibraltar defender Danny Higginbotham received the man of the match award. Background Gibraltar first applied for UEFA membership in 1997 but was rejected because of intense opposition from Spain due to the disputed status of Gibraltar and that the territory's acceptance would inspire separatist Basque and Catalan national football teams to apply for membership as well. They reapplied unsuccessfully in 2007 with only three member nations supporting their bid after Spain threatened to withdraw Spanish teams from all UEFA competitions. They tried again in October 2012 and were granted full membership in March 2013. The team's first announced match was against Estonia in Tallinn on 5 March 2014, but in October 2013 Slovakia, who had been UEFA members since 1993, were named as Gibraltar's first opponents. Slovakia began 2013 with a narrow 2‚Äì1 away defeat to Belgium. This was followed by two consecutive home draws, 1‚Äì1 in a 2014 FIFA World Cup qualification match against Lithuania and 0‚Äì0 in a friendly against Sweden. On 7 June 2013 they faced Liechtenstein away in a World Cup qualifier, Martin B√ºchel gave the host a surprise lead but J√°n ƒéurica equalised 60 minutes later for Slovakia, despite the late goal the match was considered an upset, co-coaches Stanislav Griga and Michal Hipp were sacked after the match as they failed to win their last six matches. The Slovak Football Association appointed former Slovakia midfielder J√°n Koz√°k as the new head coach of the national team in July 2013. Koz√°k's first match was a friendly away to Romania which ended in a 1‚Äì1 draw. After Koz√°k's appointment Slovakia had four remaining World Cup qualifiers: a win, a draw and two losses saw Slovakia finish UEFA Group G in third place and failed to qualify for the 2014 FIFA World Cup. The final match before facing Gibraltar was a friendly against Poland away in Warsaw, first half goals from Juraj Kucka and R√≥bert Mak gave Slovakia a 2‚Äì0 win. The Victoria Stadium is the only football stadium in Gibraltar but does not meet UEFA's standards for competitive internationals, so it was agreed they would use the Est√°dio Algarve in Faro/Loul√©, Portugal for competitive matches until Gibraltar had an eligible stadium of their own. Even though the Victoria Stadium is eligible for friendly matches the Gibraltar Football Association decided to play the match against Slovakia at the Est√°dio Algarve to give them a chance to test the stadium for its future use.

As Slovakia were heavy favourites for a comfortable win over Gibraltar the draw resulted in opposite feelings for both managers: Gibraltar's Allen Bula said the result was \\"a dream come true\\" while Slovakia's J√°n Koz√°k described the result as \\"a huge disappointment\\" for him. Defender Danny Higginbotham, who qualifies for Gibraltar via his grandmother, was the recipient of the man of the match award and declared the result as \\"one of the best\\" in his career. The match was the last in 2013 for both teams; Gibraltar's next match was a friendly against the Faroe Islands at the Victoria Stadium in March 2014, the first official match played in Gibraltar since their acceptance into UEFA. They took the lead with a goal from captain Roy Chipolina before going on to lose 4‚Äì1. The result was the largest away win for the Faroes and it was also their joint largest win overall, equalling their 3‚Äì0 win over San Marino in 1995. Slovakia's next match was also a friendly, but they were away to Israel; goals from Martin Jakubko, J√°n ƒéurica and R√≥bert Mak ensured a 3‚Äì1 win for Slovakia. In 2014 Gibraltar gained their second draw and first win, 1‚Äì1 against Estonia and 1‚Äì0 against Malta ‚Äî they lost the other six matches. That same year they took part in their first major international competition entering the qualifying rounds for UEFA Euro 2016. Slovakia would go through 2014 winning eight of the nine fixtures they played, losing the other 0‚Äì1 to Russia; they began their sixth qualifying campaign for the UEFA European Championship the same year. Slovakia were able to qualify for the main tournament as runners-up of Group C while Gibraltar finished bottom of Group D without a point and failed to qualify.

The region was carved out of the northern part of the Volta Region and will be in fulfillment of a campaign promise made by New Patriotic Party. Prior to the 2016 Ghanaian general election, the then candidate Nana Akufo- Addo declared that when elected, he would explore the possibility of creating new regions out of some of the existing regions in Ghana in order to bring government closer to citizens.  History  The execution of plans for the creation of the regions was seeded to the newly created Ministry of Regional Reorganization and Development which is under the leadership of Hon. Dan Botwe. Government of Ghana ministry charged with the responsibility of supervising the creation of new regions in Ghana. In March 2017, the ministry sent the blue print for the creation of the region along with others to the Council of State. The council met over 36 times from the time of submission to August 2017. The final stage for the creation of the region was decided through a referendum by the people within the catchment of the new region. A referendum on 27 December 2018 approved the creation of Oti Region. On election day, 323,708 out of 366,481 (88.33% voter turnout) registered voters cast their votes.

The game has two releases, an offline version of the game, and an online multiplayer version. The game has also had an additional iPad release. Gameplay As with other entries in the Virtual Pool series, the game is controlled by keyboard and mouse.

Season 1 aired on every Saturday at 22:30 (KST) beginning November 25, 2017 to June 1, 2019. Season 2, named More Salty Tour (), began on June 17, 2019 and broadcast timing changed to Mondays at 23:00 (KST). The show had a hiatus after the episode on March 16, 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which made travelling and filming for the show difficult. On June 1, it was confirmed that filming for the show had resumed. The program will continue from June 30 and broadcast timing changed to Tuesdays at 19:40 (KST). The last episode was aired on August 4. Program Season 1 For every destination, 2 or 3 of the cast members (or invited guest(s)) are assigned as 1-day tour guides and are given the same budget per person. There are also scenarios where cast members and/or guests work together as the day's tour guides. With a fixed budget, the tour guide(s) for each day have to attempt to provide a best vacation experience. The judging of the 1-day tours will be done by the remaining cast members and invited guests, based on the food, places of interest, accommodation and a temporary criteria (which changes for every destination) for each day. The winning tour guide can get to enjoy a Small Luxury that each of the tour guide wants to enjoy after being the winning tour guide of the destination. Season 2 (More Salty Tour) This season sticks to the same format and rules of Season 1, which emphasised on 1-day tours under tight budgets. However, a new rule is added in this season. For every destination, whoever are assigned as 1-day tour guides can each choose a luxury spot (defined as one that is not the least expensive, but gives more satisfaction), either for food, place of interest or accommodation. The cast members and invited guest(s) have to complete a mission from the production team to get to go for the luxury spot, if not they will have to go for the cheapest alternative of it, arranged by the production team. The winning tour guide(s) for every destination will get a golden badge. A new format was introduced starting from the 9th tour. 2 (or 2 teams of) tour guides will battle against each other, and the remaining cast members and invited guest(s) will each choose to follow 1, hence 2 different tours in the same destination are held on the same day. In the middle of the day, all are gathered for an evaluation, where the remaining cast members and guest(s) can either continue to follow the same tour guide each of them chose at first or change to be guided under the other tour guide if he/she is not satisfied with the previous part of the tour. =Domestic Version= The sub-title beginning episode 116 is Wise Online Travel (Ïä¨Í∏∞Î°úÏö¥ÎûúÏÑ†Ïó¨Ìñâ).

The William C. Davis Science Building is named in his honor. He is best known for his research in food chemistry. He discovered arabinogalactan and used it to create instant mashed potatoes. His discoveries also improved potato chips and soft serve ice cream. He developed an organic glue for use in particle board. More recently, he co-developed the formula for Dasani water. In addition to his scientific work, he is a Lutheran lay minister, served during the Korean War, and has received the Purple Heart. Education William Conan Davis was born on August 22, 1926 in Waycross, Georgia to Kince Charles Davis and his wife Laura Jane (n√©e Cooper; July 9, 1898 ‚Äì June 6, 2004). Kince Davis' family were of Ethiopian Jewish descent, and he read Hebrew but not English. Kince Davis was employed as a railway construction engineer and crew boss, a position that brought him threats from the Ku Klux Klan. He later started a herbal medicine business, the only source of medical care accessible to many black people in Georgia. William Davis spent time during the summers with his maternal grandfather Jonnas Franklin, a Sioux Indian who farmed and hunted near the Okefenokee Swamp. William Davis attended Magnolia Grammar School and Dasher High School in Valdosta, Georgia. He received a high school diploma from Dasher in 1944. His family was active in civil rights and supportive of their children's education. On one occasion Kince Davis drove his sons William and Kenneth to Tuskegee Institute (a distance of 300 miles in a Tin Lizzie) to attend a workshop with George Washington Carver and Henry Ford. This experience fueled William's interest in becoming a chemist. Dasher High School did not teach at a college preparatory level, leaving William at a disadvantage in science and mathematics. To prepare him for college, William's family sent him to New York City in 1944. He lived with his older brother, actor and civil rights activist Ossie Davis. He attended Dwight High School, taking preparatory classes in science and graduating in 1945. William Davis briefly attended the City College of New York, but was advised to transfer to Talladega College in Alabama where he could get more individual support in calculus. Davis was enrolled in the U.S. Army Reserve Officers' Training Corps. During his first year at Talladega, he was drafted to serve in the Korean War. He was commissioned as a Second Lieutenant in the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. He served in Germany and was awarded a Purple Heart in 1953. On his return, Davis completed his B.S. degree in chemistry at Talladega College, graduating in 1956. He was one of three students chosen for a George Washington Carver research fellowship to attend Tuskegee Institute in 1956. At the time, it was almost impossible for a black scientist to train for a professional career in research in the United States. Even at Tuskegee, the usual career track was to train as a teacher, with a specialization in one's area of interest. Davis was determined to do research. He worked with Clarence T. Mason of Tuskegee and studied the hydrolysis rate of compounds in jet fuel. This research enabled him to meet Wernher Von Braun of the U.S. Space & Rocket Center. Davis received his Master of Science degree in organic chemistry from Tuskegee in 1958. Doctoral research It was extremely difficult for a black student to find support for a Ph.D. program in research. The University of Idaho was the only university willing to accept Davis as a research-track graduate student. Davis and his wife Ocia moved to Moscow, Idaho. Perhaps not surprisingly, given this location, his thesis research involved potatoes. Davis studied the process of sloughing, by which plant materials break down. This has important applications in food chemistry. Soup manufacturers want potatoes that tend to stay firm, not sloughing. Makers of mashed potatoes want potato flakes to break down rapidly and reform with a uniform, soft consistency. Meanwhile, the Industrial Research department at nearby Washington State University advertised for summer researchers to study the buildup of particles on saw blades in lumber mills. Davis applied and was able to identify the source of the problem. He isolated and extracted a dry, crystal-like powder, arabinogalactan, that produced a sticky paste when water was added to it. This water-soluble polysaccharide is found in Western Larch trees (Larix occidentalis) and other plants and is believed to have health benefits. At the time, no one had any idea of how to make use of the substance Davis had identified. Back at the University of Idaho, Davis studied potato chips and what caused them to blister when fried. He was able to isolate the substance that caused the blistering, but when it was removed from the potatoes they disintegrated. Frustrated by the apparent stalemate in both lines of research, Davis tried adding arabinogalactans to his potato mixtures. The water was absorbed, and the potatoes fluffed up. Davis' approach improved the sloughing properties of the potatoes and created instant mashed potatoes with a more desirable texture and consistency. While completing his doctorate, Davis worked with scientists at Washington State University in a variety of fields, including clinical research with Mark Adams. Davis did further research into the extraction of arabinogalactan from larch trees. He identified a sugar that makes frozen desserts smoother and is used to make soft-serve ice cream. He also helped to discover a wood sugar that is used in industrial glue to make compressed wood. These discoveries were not patented, and most were further developed by others. Davis received his Ph.D. in biochemistry from the University of Idaho in 1965. His Ph.D. thesis was A Study of Sloughing in the Potato Tuber (1965). He was the first African- American to receive a Ph.D. from the University of Idaho. Further career After graduation, Davis accepted a position as a researcher with the Division of Industrial Research at Washington State University, researching antigens for hay fever. Davis worked as a post-doctoral fellow with Rosalyn Yalow at the Bronx Veteran's Affairs Hospital, where he learned radioimmunoassay techniques for use with diabetic patients. Using his knowledge of radioimmunoassay techniques Davis developed standardized tests for the detection of thyroxin in the blood stream. He also developed standardized blood tests for insulin and growth hormones. Davis was recruited as a health physicist and became head of the radioactivity department at United Medical Laboratories in Portland, Oregon. Following certification as a medial technologist, Davis became director of the laboratory. He spent nearly fifteen years as Director of United Medical Laboratories. Concerned about the lack of medical facilities available to African Americans in the Portland area, Davis worked with Kent Ford of the Portland Black Panther Party and others to establish the Fred Hampton Memorial Clinic in 1970. The clinic offered free medical services to both blacks and whites in the Albina neighborhood. Davis was one of the few black professionals to volunteer at the clinic: its doctors were predominantly white. He was strongly involved in its sickle-cell anemia initiatives. The clinic emphasized screening, education and counseling about the genetic disorder which disproportionately affects African Americans. In 1972, Davis helped put on the Black Community Survival Conference, a protest against the expansion of the Emanuel Hospital. The expansion was planned without community input and largely destroyed the commercial center of a historically black neighborhood. From 1974 to 1975, Davis was a visiting scientist at the George Hyman Research Institute in Washington, D.C. From 1979 to 1982, Davis was a research associate in Molecular Pharmacology at the University of Texas Health Science Center in San Antonio, Texas. He worked with Maharaj K. Ticku to study the effects of picrotoxin, benzodiazepines, pentobarbital, ethanol, and other psychoactive substances on receptor binding sites. In 1983, Davis was hired as an instructor in the chemistry department at St. Philip's College, giving him more opportunity for teaching as well as research. He became a full professor of chemistry in 1995. He became the chair of the Natural Sciences Department in 1996. He was also the director of Renewable Energy at St. Philip's College. While at St. Philip's College, one of Davis' focuses of study was water. Davis worked with United Beverage company to study the behavioral properties of Penta Water, which he nicknamed \\"kinetic water\\". The company promoted their product as having uniquely distinct chemical properties due to its purification process. Davis studied characteristics such as boiling point, pH, polarity and surface tension. With Lanier Byrd, Davis co-created the formula that gives a characteristic taste to Dasani water, a product of The Coca-Cola Company . In addition to hydrology, Davis was interested in recombinant DNA and fuel cell technologies for renewable energy. Davis retired in 2009, becoming a professor emeritus of St. Philip's College. At that time, it was decided to rename the natural sciences building in his honor to acknowledge his contributions. Funds were raised to renovate the building, and it was reopened and dedicated as the William C. Davis Science Building in 2012. A portrait of William Davis, commissioned from Howard Rhoder, hangs in the science building. Davis has also been active in preserving the history of science. He has helped to establish the Ernest Stevenson Collection of scientific books and artifacts, to be housed at the Sutton Learning Center at St. Philip's College. He is working on his memoirs with the support of historian Jeanette Nyda Mendelssohn Passty.

Peiris is a British astrophysicist at University College London, best known for her work on the cosmic microwave background radiation. She was one of 27 scientists who received the Breakthrough Prize in Fundamental Physics in 2018 for their \\"detailed maps of the early universe.\\" Education Peiris was born in Sri Lanka. She completed her undergraduate studies in Physical Natural Sciences at the University of Cambridge in 1998, at New Hall, now known as Murray Edwards College. She earned a PhD at Princeton at the Department of Astrophysical Sciences, where she first worked on the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP). She went on to work at the Kavli Institute for Cosmological Physics at the University of Chicago as a Hubble fellow. Research and career Having held several competitive postdoctoral fellowships, in 2007 Peiris returned to the University of Cambridge as an STFC Advanced Fellow and was awarded a Junior Research Fellowship at King's College, Cambridge in 2008. In 2009, Peiris won a Leverhulme Trust award for cosmology and secured a faculty position at University College London. She is currently Professor of Astrophysics at UCL and also the Director of the Oskar Klein Centre for Cosmoparticle Physics in Stockholm. In 2012, the WMAP team (including Peiris) won the Gruber Cosmology Prize for their \\"exquisite measurements of anisotropies in the relic radiation from the Big Bang---the Cosmic Microwave Background\\". WMAP's results on cosmic inflation, which Peiris contributed to, were described by Stephen Hawking as \\"the most exciting development in physics during his career\\". She was skeptical about the 2014 announcement of the discovery of primordial gravitational waves in the cosmic microwave background: \\"If they announce gravitational waves on Monday then I will need a great deal of convincing. But if they do have a robust detection ... Jesus wow! I'll be taking next week off.\\" Mike Hockney used this quote to illustrate that even top scientists need convincing because scientific discoveries are always just interpretations of results. Her skepticism proved well-founded: on January 30, 2015, a joint analysis of BICEP2 and Planck data was published and the European Space Agency announced that the signal can be entirely attributed to dust in the Milky Way, though (non-primordial) gravitational waves have since been detected by different experiments. In 2016, Peiris was elected as a fellow of the American Physical Society and Vice President of the Royal Astronomical Society. In 2018, Peiris was awarded the Hoyle Medal and Prize of the UK Institute of Physics for ‚Äúher leading contributions to understanding the origin and evolution of cosmic structure.\\" In 2020 Peiris was awarded the G√∂ran Gustafsson Prize in physics by the G√∂ran Gustafsson Foundation and the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences \\"for her innovative research on the dynamics of the early universe, which links cosmological observations to basic physics‚Äù. She was also elected as a member of STFC Council, the senior strategic advisory body of the research council that funds particle physics and astronomy in the United Kingdom. Public engagement Alongside academic talks, Peiris gives public lectures about cosmology. She has written articles and given interviews for both radio and print media. She has appeared on podcasts, television programs and the national news. In 2013 she gave a talk at TEDxCERN, \\"Multiplying Dimensions.\\" That year she was selected as one of Astronomy's top ten rising stars by Astronomy Magazine. In 2014, the pseudonymously-written Ephraim Hardcastle diary column in the Daily Mail claimed that Peiris (along with Maggie Aderin- Pocock) had been selected to discuss results from the Background Imaging of Cosmic Extragalactic Polarization 2 (BICEP-2) experiment on BBC Newsnight because of her gender and ethnicity. These comments were condemned by mainstream media, the Royal Astronomical Society and Peiris' employer, University College London, and the Daily Mail and its column backed down within days. Peiris offered a rebuttal, \\"Groundbreaking science is blind to prejudice\\" in Times Higher Education. In 2017, Peiris collaborated with artist Penelope Rose Cowley to create artwork entitled \\"Cosmoparticle\\".

For the past twenty five years, the Nguyen Temples have been the official artists to Ogyen Trinley Dorje, the 17th Gyalwa Karmapa, and Tsurphu Monastery, Tibet. Terris, Ogyen Trinley Dorje, Leslie, and son Sonam Dorje in 2017 History Terris' first teacher was the State Artist of Tibet, the late Master Jampa Tsedan, the Dalai Lama's artist. Later Terris studied with the late Taklung Tsetrul Rinpoche - Simla, India; the late Sherpa artist Pargyaltsen (Kapa Ngawong Damcho) - Nepal; the late Dolpo artist Pema Wangyal, and the late Newar artist Siddhimuni Shakya - Kathmandu. In 1969 Terris became one Rangjung Rigpe Dorje, 16th Karmapa's original Western disciples. In 1974 at the invitation of Chogyam Trungpa Rinpoche, Terris taught thangka painting at the then Naropa Institute in Boulder Colorado, now Naropa University. This was the opening year of the Institute. Tsurphu Appliques 1992‚Äì1997 Terris and fellow artist Leslie Nguyen created two giant silk appliques for Tsurphu Monastery in Tibet. Karma Gadri Goku applique Tsurphu Monastery is the Karmapa's main seat in Tibet and was established in 1187 by the 1st Karmapa, Dusum Khyenpa. The Karma Gadri Applique (gos-sku chen-mo, 108 ft x 76 ft, 35m x 23m). The Mahakala Goku (applique, gos-sku chen-mo, 30 ft x 30 ft, 10m x 10 m). The Mahakala Applique The originals had been destroyed during the Cultural Revolution in the mid 1960s, and no photographic records existed. The Abbot of Tsurphu, Drupon Dechen Rinpoche gave the artists oral instructions. Carrying the Karma Gadri thangka Two ceremonial banners, as companion pieces for the two giant appliques were requested by Tsurphu in 1997. These works are shown annually during major cultural festivals at Tsurphu, attended by devotees from all over Tibet, a tradition that began at the monastery in 1590. During Saga Dawa, the festival honoring the Buddha's birth, enlightenment and Parnirvana, the Karma Gadri Goku is shown. It takes a minimum of sixty strong people to carry the Karma Gadri thangka out of the Temple for display on the Mountain. The Tsechur Drabje (40m x 2m, 120 ft x 7 ft) which is the ceremonial companion piece, is being made now in India by the 17th Karmapa. Upon completion the two artists will take it to Tsurphu. The Mahakala Goku (completed in 1997), and its companion the Gutor (Norbu) Drabje appliqu√© (completed in 2007). They are both and are used during the Gutor Festival to purify the Tibetan Lunar New Year. The Tsechur Drobje drawings were presented in 2016 to the 17th Karmapa Ogyen Trinley Dorje. The sewing work is expected to be completed in 2019 and will also be given to Tsurphu Monastery. The Gyalwa Karmapa Ogyen Trinley Dorje is the supreme head of the 900 year old Karma Kagyu order of Tibetan Buddhism. Terris and Leslie are involved with the Karmapa's Koryug Organization, doing environment projects in the Himalayas.Official letter from the 17th Gyalwa Karmapa introducing Terris Temple and Leslie Nguyen. Terris is also the Executive Director of Liberation Arts, a registered USA non profit organization, relating to art, culture and the environment. Liberation Arts was created with advice from the 17th Karmapa in 2010. Current projects Presently Terris is executive producer in a feature documentary \\"Thongdrol\\" on the subject of Tibetan art especially the lineage style Karma Gadri with the Karmapa. He is also completing a documentary \\"Tsurphu, the Giant Appliques\\", using the archival footage of the giant appliqu√©s created for Tsurphu, 1992‚Äì2017. In Maui Hawaii 1976, the 16th Karmapa advised Terris to do flower and bird painting in addition to thangkas, which Terris only produces by commission. These bird and flower paintings are created using mineral and botanical pigments with the techniques of traditional Tibetan painting. A few are graced with the 17th Karmapa's calligraphy at the ages of 8 and 14 years old.

These colors are natural pigments used before aniline dyes took the market in the 1860s and Terris has used them since the 1960s. The silks used are from China, Japan, Thailand and Vietnam. Many of these paintings are of extinct and endangered species as Terris is passionate on the preservation of our environment for future generations.

Military career Military career during World War 2 left Born the son of a successful Tulip farmer. After completing his study in London, Visser could not return to the Netherlands as it was under German occupation as the World War II just begun. Visser volunteered in Dutch Legion in United Kingdom. He was then assigned as driver for Queen Wilhelmina. He resigned from that post and volunteered to be Radioman in No. 2 Dutch Troop, No. 10 (Inter-Allied) Commando. Along with other allied troops, Visser participated in his first battle in Operation Market Garden, when the unit was incorporated into 82nd Airborne Division. Two weeks later, Visser was reassigned to 101st Airborne Division and landed in Eindhoven. On 1 November 1944, Visser was reassigned to Royal Commando and conducted amphibious assault in Walcheren. Military Career in Royal Netherlands East Indies Army He then attended officer school prior to being sent to Asia. As an officer, Visser attended paratrooper school in India and intended to join other allied forces in Asia to fight Japan forces in Dutch East Indies. However, Japan was surrendered before Visser was sent to the Dutch East Indies. Visser was assigned to be an instructor in a Dutch special forces school in India known as School Opleiding Parachutisten /SOP (Paratrooper School). The school was later moved to Jakarta in 1946 and then moved again to Hollandia. Visser grew to like living in the Dutch East Indies, and asked his wife (a British woman he had married during the war) and his sons and daughters to remain with him in the Dutch East Indies. When his wife refused, he opted for divorce. By the time he returned in 1947, the school had already moved to Cimahi, Bandung, and Visser was promoted to captain. During 1947‚Äì1949, the paratrooper school led by Captain Visser continued to educate elite paratroopers until transfer of power to Indonesia. Captain Visser then opted to stay in Indonesia as a civilian, moving to Bandung , working as a flower farmer di Pacet, Lembang, embrace Islam, marry his Sundanesse lover and change his name to be Mochammad Idjon Djanbi. Military Career in Indonesian Army On 15 April 1952, Colonel Alexander Evert Kawilarang began to form Kesatuan Komando Tentara Territorium III/Siliwangi (Kesko TT), the early name of Kopassus and the basis for this historic special forces unit. Not long after, Colonel Kawilarang with the use of military intelligence located and met with Visser who had remained a peaceful and law-abiding citizen in newly independent Indonesia, settled in West Java, married an Indonesian woman, and was known locally as Mochammad Idjon Djanbi. He was the first recruit for the Army special forces and given the rank of major, as well as its first commander. Due to him, the unit which later became Kopassus wear red berets instead of the distinctive green beret (color traditionally favored by airborne troops in Europe). In 1956, with increasing combat capability of special forces, Army leadership saw opportunity to place the unit under the hands of indigenous officers. Due to lack in tact, this angered Djanbi and cause him to resigned his position as commander. Later he was given position at a plantation as a result of the nationalization of a number of foreign-owned plantation. Prior to his retirement in 1969, he was promoted to be lieutenant colonel at the special force anniversary.

The stories move through other unusual experiences from the title story of a friendship between an introvert and a manatee to the delightfully silly misadventures of the Breakfast Hunter who is trying to retrieve a morning coffee. \\"Hidden in these bizarre and odd stories are glimmers of heart and soul, and lessons learned.

It is on a broken slab, and now housed at the Indian Museum, Kolkata. Heinrich L√ºders and Klaus Ludwig Janert (1961), MathurƒÅ inscriptions, G√∂ttingen : Vandenhoeck & Ruprecht, , pages 203-204, 154, image on page 318 The Mountain Temple inscription makes an early mention of Hindu and Jain temple architecture, where its shape is described to be like a mountain and accompanied with an assembly hall (sabha). The inscription's wording and arrangement, state Luders and Janert, closely resembles the Mora Well inscription, now in Mathura museum. Both describe a donation of a stone temple, halls and slabs; however, the Mora Well inscription is more detailed and mentions pratima. The Rajula in line 3 of the Mountain Temple inscription is likely the Northern Satraps Great Satrap Rajuvula, found in Mathura lion capital. The Mountain Temple inscription lacks a date. The similar Mora Well Inscription is dated to the early decades of the 1st-century CE and is related to early Vaishnavism: the Mora Well inscription mentions stone shrines dedicated to five Vrishni heroes. Inscription The discovered inscription is incomplete, in not quite correct Sanskrit. It reads: > 1\\\\. . . . uvulasya putrasya mahaksatrapasya so ... 2\\\\. . . . ti parvato > prasade(or do) sabha silapata ... 3\\\\. . . . taviryo rane rajulas ca pi[ta] > ... 4\\\\. . . . sasyedam arca ...

Supposedly, the cyclone struck Bombay on 6 June 1882. Though it is widely reported, even in scientific literature, historical research shows that it did not in fact happen. Example accounts of the supposed event Reportedly, the earliest mention of the supposed cyclone so far discovered by researchers is in an article entitled 'Hurricane second only to tornado in wind violence' by M.

A 2014 academic article claims that: 'the deadliest storm surge of Arabian sea was Great Bombay Cyclone, took place in 1882 causing 100,000 . It is one of ten deadliest tropical cyclones of the known history of the world'.A. S. Rana, Q. Zaman, M. Afzal, M . A.

If a storm of anything like the reported magnitude had happened, it would have killed about an eighth of Bombay's population, and would have been widely reported. There does appear to have been a storm with heavy rain and strong winds on 4 June 1882, but it does not answer to descriptions of the supposed cyclone of 6 June. Bombay's biggest cyclone event of the nineteenth century in fact appears to have been 'in 1854, when \\"property valued at half-a-million pounds sterling\\" was destroyed in four hours and a thousand people were killed'.Amitav Ghosh, The Great Derangement: Climate Change and the Unthinkable (London: Penguin, 2016), chapter 10, citing [Stephen Meredith Edwardes], The Gazetteer of Bombay City and Island, 3 vols (Bombay: The Times Press, 1909), I 99.

It depicts four stylized figures of whalers with oars in an open boat, with harpoons ready and water spraying. It is made in the style of a compass rose and rotates slowly.

It was one of the first organizations of Lithuanian women. Its members were known as zitietƒós. History Restrictions of organizing various societies and organizations were relaxed after the Russian Revolution of 1905. In 1905, philanthropist J√≥zef Montwi≈Ç≈Ç began organizing female servants and workers, both Polish and Lithuanian, into a society in Vilnius. Its Lithuanian members separated in 1906 and obtained premises (three rooms) at the former Franciscan monastery by the Church of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary in October 1906. Under the name of the Community of St. Nicholas (≈†v. Mikalojaus bendrija), they became an autonomous section of the Lithuanian Mutual Assistance Society of Vilnius (Vilniaus lietuvi≈≥ savi≈°alpos draugija). The community was officially registered on 6 December 1906. Its founders included priest Antanas Viskantas and Emilija Vilei≈°ienƒó. From 1911 until its dissolution, the society was headed by , vicar at Vilnius Cathedral. In 1913, the society separated from the Mutual Assistance Society and became an independent Society of Saint Zita. It had about 800 members. Former headquarters of the Society of Saint Zita in Kaunas (completed in 1925) The Society of Saint Zita in Kaunas was organized separately by priests and Juozapas Jara≈°i≈´nas (government permissions for societies were given separately in each governorate). It was officially registered on 3 July 1907, and Jara≈°i≈´nas was elected its chairman. It had 315 members in 1907 and about 600 members in 1912. Other sections were organized in Panevƒó≈æys, ≈†iauliai, Ukmergƒó, Raseiniai, Zarasai as well as in Riga (1910) and Saint Petersburg (1914). The section in Panevƒó≈æys was closed by Russian authorities in 1912. After Lithuania regained Independence in 1918, the society spread more widely across Lithuania; e.g. section in Tel≈°iai was established in 1919. The society constructed its four-storey headquarters (architect ) in 1925 at a cost of 400,000 litas (present-day Theological Faculty of Vytautas Magnus University). The society was closed on 10 September 1940 by the Council of People's Commissars of the Lithuanian SSR. Activities The society promoted Lithuanian culture, supported Catholic faith, and protected women's virtues. The society organized educational courses, local reading rooms, social evenings with music and theater performances, operated laundries, spinning mills, and other small businesses for women, provided temporary shelter and financial assistance to struggling members, maintained shelters for the elderly. During World War I, its members nursed injured soldiers and cared for the prisoners of war. Some members, after receiving the basic education from the society, became primary school or catechism teachers in villages. While the society united household workers, it was not a union as it did not intervene in conflicts between employees and employers. The society, often organized and led by priests, was very conservative and did not show greater interest in the wider women's movement.

This species flowers annually in the summer-time but on rare occasions it has been found to be biennial. R. persicarioides is not cultivated for human use and should not be confused with the similarly named genus Persicariae. Taxonomy Rumex persicarioides was first described by Carl Linnaeus in 1753. It has been treated as a variety of Rumex maritimus (as R. maritimus var. persicarioides by R. S. Mitchell), but is accepted as a full species by other sources, including the online Flora of North America.  Description  R. persicarioides stands erect at about 15-75cm in height. The plant contains papillose and pubescent protrusions in its inflorescence and on the abaxial leaf blade. The stem is mostly inflorescent, with branching mostly starting a third of the way up from the base. Shorter plants start inflorescence at the base of the stem. Flowers of R. persicarioides are straw-colored and densely whorled at the distal most end of the inflorescence. The flowers consist of triangular tepals with tooth-like margins and brown fruiting achenes. The pedicels are threadlike and weakly visible, being 3-7mm in length. The leaves of R. persicarioides are long, thin lanceolate or oblong-lanceolate blades ranging from 5-25cm in length with vaguely undulated or entire margins. Leaf blades are either truncate or cordate at the base and acute at the tip.  Distribution  R. persicarioides thrives in wet and saline ecosystems, typically being found in coastal regions and salt marshes. It is native to western Canada and the US (British Columbia, Oregon and California) and eastern Canada and the northeastern US (New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, Quebec, Connecticut, Massachusetts and New York State).

Description The Mora Well Inscription makes an early mention of pratima (murti, images), stone shrine (temple) and calls the five Vrishnis as bhagavatam. It is dated to the early decades of 1st century CE during the reign of Sodasa, probably circa 15 CE. Identification The Mora Well inscription does not use specifically sectarian language, and various interpretations have been given. The Hindu Puranas, such as the medieval Vayu Purana in section 97.1-2, name Samkarsana, Vasudeva, Pradyumna, Samba and Aniruddha as \\"heroes of the dynasty of the Vrishni\\". The inscription may also signify the growth of Bhagavatism in 1st millennium BCE to Vaishnavism by the early centuries of the common era, and a process by which heroes and heroic ideas attract devotion. There is no mention of these heroes in ancient Brahmanical literature, but some scholars, such as Chandra, state that the five Vrishnis mentioned in the inscription is a reference to the Pandavas of the Mahabharata. According to Sonya Quintanilla, the Mora inscription is not sectarian and may not necessarily relate to the roots of Vaishnavism. It could be cross-sectarian ‚Äì Jainism and Hinduism, or equally possibly reflect early Bhagavata movement, states Quintanilla. According to Rosenfield, the Mora well inscription refers to the five Vrishni heroes, but their exact identity is unclear. They ‚Äì including Vasudeva and Krishna ‚Äì may have been ancient kings in the Mathura area, who became deified because of their heroic accomplishments. They \\"personified certain qualities of Vishnu and thus in effect [were deified as] his avatars\\", states Rosenfield, and this may be \\"an extremely early form of Vaishnavism now called Pancaratra system\\" also found in Besnagar, Nanaghat and Ghasundi. Another explanation is that of Luders, who relying on Jain texts dated between 9th and 12th-century CE, states that the Vrishnis may have been the five Jain heroes led by Akr≈´ra. The cult of the Vrishnis may have been cross-sectarian, much like the cult of the Yakshas. Reign of Sodasa The inscription mentions the name of the Great Satrap Rajuvula, and was apparently made by his son, the Great Satrap of Mathura Sodasa. The discovery of the Mora Well Inscription in the 19th-century led archaeologists to excavate the Mora Mound in 1911-12, near the Mora well. They found large inscribed bricks of a round brick building with the name of a female, probably the daughter of king Brihasvatimitra from Kausambi of late 2nd century BCE. In the mound were also found two male torsos, as well as a lower half of a female torso with inscribed names Kanishka and Tosha, confirming the possible link between the inscription stone and the mound. Inscription The discovered inscription is incomplete. The opening is hybrid Sanskrit, while the remaining three lines are standard Sanskrit. It reads: > 1\\\\. mahaksatrapasa ramjuvulasa putrasa svami ... 2\\\\. bhagavatam vrsnina[m] > pamcaviranam pratima[h] sailadevagr[he] ... 3\\\\. ya[s] tosayah sailam > srimadgrham atulam udadha samadhara ... 4\\\\. arcadesam sailam pamca jvalata > iva paramavapusa ... ‚Äì Mora Well Inscription, 1st century CE Translation Sonya Quintanilla translates it as, See also *Hindu temple *Hindu temple architecture *Mountain Temple inscription References Category:Indian inscriptions Category:Mathura Category:Sanskrit inscriptions in India ","title":"Mora Well Inscription"},{"id":"56033485","text":"Kanattakankanamlage Jayamali Indika Kankanange (born 25 September 1974) is a former Sri Lankan woman cricketer.
